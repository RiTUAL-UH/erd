 Pretty similar wr group in a 16 teamer, except I have Fitz instead of Cruz. I actually got Marshall and Blackmon in trade. I ended up trading Moreno Steve Smith and Broyles for those 2 plus Jerome Simpson. I feel like the trade worked out well for both sides.  




 I think it could be a misprint. Ian rappaport, on twitter, is saying that he's getting an mri on his foot. Either way we still have to wait for more info.  




 Which the week the giants come off their bye :) 




 If someone has the luxury to drop a lot of cash on fantasy football then he doesn't have much to bitch about.  




 Update on the situation: https://twitter.com/ConorTOrr/status/388765847554383872

From rotoworld:
"That's not the way it was presented to me," Coughlin said. The Giants' coach gave a "vague timeline" on Wilson's return at 3-4 weeks, although none of this really matters until Wilson gets a second opinion on his neck during Monday's visit with specialist Dr. Robert Watkins. Wilson owners should still fear the worst, but keep Wilson rostered until the Watkins results are known 




 I wouldn't say RB2 just yet.  This was the first game that the giants oline looked competent but that could just be a result of the bears defense being incompetent.  Also Andre Brown should be back from his injury after the giants bye.  




 Dude get over it.  It is just fantasy football, this on the other hand is a pretty serious and career threatening diagnosis.  Show some empathy. 









 Has the Bears run defense been this mediocre this year? 




 Shocking the VP of Officiating defends the decision by the officials. 




 Didn't Cruz benefit from this rule 2 years ago as well? I think it was against the cardinals. 




 And Randle is soooo stupid. 




 Lets hope. 




 This is my internal dilemma.  As much as I love technology, I know whatever I decide to buy will just promote a business model that includes exploiting another human being.  The only way to stop this is to just not buy from companies who are complicit in this type of behavior. And that is why I've started to purchase second hand items.  It doesn't directly support firms who allow for these awful working conditions, I end up buying the product  at a cheaper price, and I'm not being completely wasteful and adding demand for a new product that really isn't that much different than the one that came before it.  

Also is there a site or subreddit that keeps track of companies that force their workers to work in such awful conditions? Is there a site or subreddit that keeps track of the companies that do the exact opposite and pay their employees respectable wages or even living wages for producing all these consumer goods?

EDIT: And this is why I also don't necessarily bitch about prices on products.  There is a limit I am willing to spend on something but bitching about prices is just silly.  The price of a product is a derivative of its cost and demand.  If I want to buy something new that is cheap it most likely means that the cost of labor associated to it is cheap, which in turn means that person or people who created this product are most likely not being paid a sufficient amount to make the item. 




 Looks like Stacy will get the bulk of the carries:

https://twitter.com/jthom1/status/386880914292105216 
























 He suffered it in the 2nd to last drive.  He had a couple of good runs at the beginning of the last drive and then came in for that last atrocious play. 




 No details at the moment. 




 According to the post game press conference, Fisher vaguely stated he has a sprained ankle. 









 Unfortunately he was taken for x-rays.

 Since when has the US government been concerned over the privacy rights of its citizens? 




 I agree.  I would like to keep MIR to a minimum.  But I would have to ask my friend. 




 Hey everyone! I'm trying to build a gaming rig for my friend.  He wants it to be under $800 including the price of the monitor.  He plans on playing Elder Scrolls Online and BF4 at 1080p.  Here is what I've quickly come up with.  All opinions are appreciated:

 You can a VPN in the Netherlands and then go to gamepass.nfl.com and watch all the games there for free.  The NFL as an attempt to spread football has offered free game streams there.

You could also just use an antennae to watch local games in HD.

Check out [r/cordcutters](http://www.reddit.com/r/cordcutters/) for more info regarding ditching cable. 




 We have the inalienable right to say and express any idea we want.  If an nfl player is willing to deal with the consequences (ie fines or media/fan attention), he should say whatever he wants.  I really don't see how this is a slippery slope. 




 I feel like a simple, but costly solution concerning player health and safety would be that the NFL just covers the cost of medical expenses for each player for life after they retire from the sport.  I feel that is a fair compromise considering NFL players do not get guaranteed contracts and that the NFL owners do nothing.  The players provide the entertainment, not the owners and not the other NFL executives.  I just really wish the NFLPA was a better run organization and actually used that reality as leverage. 




 I think it would be "pretty dumb" to jump to the conclusion that the Chargers would run it like that based off of a one game sample size against a bad run defense.   From what we have seen ALL season, not just one game, the Chargers are more likely to be passing more than they will be running it.  

As for Allen's value, he should be a top 30 WR.  It is a positive that he did well despite the fact that the team went so run heavy.  I'm not saying he will put up the same numbers he has had the past 2 weeks but he will be a solid WR3 for standard 10 team leagues. 




 Chiefs D, Moreno, Fred Jackson, Reggie Bush, Julius Thomas, Jordan Cameron, Desean Jackson, Gordon, Blackmon, and Allen. Although the latter 2 still have a small sample size of success this year.

I would also put Peyton Manning and Jimmy Graham as steals.  These guys were drafted in the 2nd or 3rd round and are probably worth a top 8 draft pick. 




 Yesterday was the first time this season that the Chargers were so balanced.  They have consistently been a pass first team during their 5 other games.   




 The biggest issue with the healthcare in the US is that it is a for profit industry. Ideally the development and applications of medicine should be motivated by benefitting the well being of humanity not concerned with increasing cash flows.   But unfortunately people just aren't that intelligent or empathetic,  especially in the US.  
























 Got 1.  But the more I think about the more I feel like ill wait a week before deciding on a trade.  This isn't something I need to do. 




 I feel the same way but the other person is adamant in involving Allen.  




 I am currently 8-1 and looking to upgrade at QB and maximize my starting lineup potential for the playoffs. The playoffs are weeks 15-17. The top 2 seeds get a bye, I am the 2nd seed and am facing the top seed this week.
My current roster is as follows:

QB: Alex smith, Mike Glennon, Vick (EJ Manuel is on waivers as well)

RB: Eddie Lacy, Staced God, Spiller, Ellington, CJ Anderson, Johnathan Franklin

WR: Antonio Brown, Keenan Allen, Eric Decker, Mike Brown

TE: Jimmy Graham

DST: Titans K: Hartley

Standard Espn scoring

The trade is as follows: I'm giving up Allen, Ellington, Alex Smith, CJ Anderson and either Antonio Brown or Decker (still unsure on which one, any help with that would also be nice!)

I will receive: Andrew Luck, Dez Bryant, Steve Smith, David Wilson, Robert Woods.

I also have a trade offer of Big Ben for Ellington waiting in the wings if this trade doesn't happen.

So what should I do?

Thanks for anyone who bother reading this. And thank you even more for those who would even bother answering! 




 Hhaha I just responeded to your other comment.  And I complete forgot about the trade thread. Ill just move this over there then. 




 Fair points.  I do feel like I should wait a week or 2 before deciding on making such a drastic move. EJ manuel is also a FA so I may drop someone for him.  I ended up making another thread to hopefully get some more input on this.  But again thanks! 




 Also thanks for the help 




 I could do an Ellington for Big Ben trade. But I think I would still prefer the starting lineup that the previous trade would produce.  I'm in no rush to make a trade.  It's just that I feel the need to maximize my starting lineup.  Having Decker, Spiller, or Elington on my bench seems like a waste.  And also most other teams seem hesitant to let go of their QB1. 




 I'm pulling off a big trade in a 16 team league.  I'm 8-1 and looking to get and upgrade at QB and maximize my starting lineup for the playoffs.  

I have Glennon, Vick and alex smith at QB.  RBs are Stacey, Lacy, Spiller, ellington, cj anderson and johnathan franklin.  WRs are Brown, Decker, and Keenan Allen. TE is graham.

 I'll be packaging Allen, Ellington, Alex smith, cj anderson, and either Decker or Brown for Andrew luck, Dez Bryant, Steve Smith, David Wilson and Robert woods.  So I'm stuck deciding who I would rather have for the rest of the year, Brown or Decker 




 I'm leaning towards Brown at the moment.  He gets more targets plus I feel like the Denver Broncos will slow down. 




 It depends on the severity of the break.  I do remember Ryan matthews needing 4-6 weeks to recover from it last year.  Either way there is no definitive timetable atm.  That will come later on in the week with more tests scheduled for Rodgers, according to a radio interview he just did.  Here's a link by from Bill Barnwell's twitter: http://www.texnews.com/1998/cowboys/ftwaik0914.html Aikman needed 6 weeks to come back.  But again there still isnt enough info and at this point there is just alot of speculation.  

I was tempted to buy low on him earlier on but after hearing the interview I've grown hesitant.  Might just have to settle for Big Ben in a trade. 




 Why would it be vetoed? I'm not colluding, I'm attempting to buy low on a player who looks to be out for 3 weeks. 




 Yes you should 




 Im 8-1, in a 16 team league and setting up for the playoff.  I'm looking to trade for a qb and was targeting Rodgers.  What would a fair offer be? I'm willing to trade Eric Decker, Spiller and Ellington.  Would 2 of the 3 be fine? Also the other team is 3-6 and only has reggie bush as a viable player. 




 This is the list of ROS ranking for RBs coming into Sunday from FantastPros: http://www.fantasypros.com/nfl/rankings/ros-rb.php 

The only RBs I'd rather have (in no particular order) would be AD, charles, McCoy, Lynch, Forte, Bush, Morris, Lacy, Gore, Moreno.  So I would have him at 11.  What do you guys think? 




 I havae both in a 16 team league and prefer Stacy mainly beacaue we know what his role is and will be going forward. Who knows what Arians plans to do with Ellington.  Also the Rams oline looked fantastic against seahawks front 7.  Meanwhile a week before the Cardinals oline looked absolutely awful against the same seahawks front 7. 
























 Thats a pretty cool chart by FO.   




 The big cost there is joining the military. 




 Are you sure? Didnt Gates play with a torn one a few years back? 




 I'm not too worried about the foot.  Yes it will always be in the back of my mind, but is there really a better replacement for him?  Maybe Gronk, but he is also an injury risk every time he gets onto the field.  Graham will have his snap counts limited as this is an injury that needs to be managed but it's not like he didn't perform the other weeks he was limited.  In regard to last week specifically, it looks like his limited snap count, especially in the red zone, was based on the Saints game plan not his injury.  Here is a full article on the subject matter:

http://espn.go.com/blog/nflnation/post/_/id/100078/saints-graham-adjusting-to-limited-role 




 Graham with one foot is still better than every TE in the league.   




 Yea it is a 16 team league and was planning on picking Fitzpatrick and McCown to play the matchups till Rodgers came back. 




 I do think that's a trade you should make.  The drop off between Smith and Allen isn't as great as the increase going from Johnson to Charles. And carolina is still a very good defense so losing KC isnt that big of a deal. 




 I'm 8-2 and trying to set my team roster up for the playoffs (weeks 15-17).  I was wondering if I should give the Rodgers owner Luck for Rodgers and tannehill.  I really have no idea how to evaluate Rodgers for ROS value considering the timetable for his return is so muddled. 




 Vereen.  Johnson is nothing more than a Tate handcuff. 




 I understand that we shouldn't get hyped up about Johnson, he probably will get the same amount of work that Tate had with Foster in the lineup.  But Tate is injury prone, so Johnson does have value. 




 That's fair.  




 I think you may be over reacting to the Rodgers injury.  We have seen good RBs do well with bad QBs, ie Stacy, AD, Charles, etc.  Obviously it would be better to have Rodgers at QB but I trust McCarthy to come up with a good offensive game plan.  He is a good coach, he had Favre and Flynn (albeit in a small sample size) look good in his system.  Lacy's schedule is just as easy Morris'. While the redskins o-line is probably better, the packer's o-line has been pretty solid at run blocking.  

With all that being said, I view both Morris and Lacy pretty similarly.  They are probably anywhere in the 8-12 range in RB rankings.  









 You dont need Spiller to get 20 carries a game to be great.  He's efficient when he gets the ball.  And I'd rather have him not get the ball that many times since he has had injury issues throughout his college and nfl career. Also the Bills run alot of plays due to their up tempo run oriented offense, so a split with Jackson isn't anything to worry about.  Even with jackson, Spiller was getting more than 18 touches a game when he was healthy the first 4 games.   




 1 qb, 2 rb, 2 wr, 1 te, 1 te/wr/rb, 1 dst, 1 k 
























 [Here's](http://www.si.com/nfl/2014/08/28/josh-gordon-suspension-browns-nfl-legal-options) a solid read in regards to Gordon's legal options. 









 All valid points and you are right to say that a single payer system may not be the most efficient system for the US. I can't say what system would be more efficient.  I do think that the US needs tighter control over its healthcare system, with the ACA the country is moving in the right direction.  The top 3 (Hong Kong, Singapore, and Japan) most efficient systems do have tight controls over their systems even though the implementations of each system are quite different from on another.

 A single payer system in the US would go a long way in solving this issue.  




 Good luck with your interviews! And thanks for the responses everyone. Your insights have been quite helpful.  I think I will end up going back to school in the fall to take a few comp sci courses to have a better foundation in that field, as well as taking a couple more math classes (calc 2 and linear algebra).  From that point I hope to apply to a grad program.  In the meantime I will try to learn as much R, Python and data science/ ML concepts in order to develop my own projects and try my hands on a few Kaggle competitions.  Hopefully this works out well, and thanks again. 




 I do have projects in mind, and have thought of participating in a Kaggle competitions as I go forward in my studies and improve. However, since I don't have the proper educational background would all that be enough to convince a potential employer to hire me? 









 I just graduated with an accounting BS from CUNY Hunter, but dont want to pursue a job or career in that field.  I am more interested in the data science/analytics and visualization field.  I have taken math and stats courses (Calc 1, a basic Sats course, and an Econometrics course), and I have also taken a Comp Sci 1 course, which taught some C++.  I am currently doing some self-learning focusing on Python (Learn Python the Hard Way), R (Courseras Computing for Data Analysis), and Databases (Stanfords Intro to DB MOOC) and later moving onto Caltechs Learning from Data course.  Im not sure if Im wasting my time or I am better off going back to school and take more Comp Sci and Math courses.  Any advice or insight would be greatly appreciated. 




 McCarthy just said, in his press conference, that Lacy "should play."   




 I thought adults knew better... 




 Yea there is that possibility. However there are apps that let you use either a smartphone or tablet as a remote for the android mini pc.  I currently use the droidmote app on my galaxy s3 or nexus 7 to control an asus tf700t connected to my tv.  There's also a cheapcast app that emulates certain features of chromecast (ie Youtube casting) that one could also use.  




 Android mini pc's are currently available.  This product doesn't sound much different than those.  The biggest difference, and an important one, is that it does come directly from Google so quicker OS updates will be available. 




 Wilfork was healthy at the time, NE run defense has been non-existent since his injury.  Like you noted Spiller was unhealthy during the Miami game so.  Pitt is a better run defense than JAX according to DVOA coming into this week: http://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/teamdef  That Pitt game, the whole Bills offense was just awful, it was Manuel's first game back from his knee injury.  It was just good to see Spiller play with the same explosiveness he had last year, even when he came back after limping off the field.   









 It all depends on who your other receivers are.  I know ppl are excited about what Brown has done the past couple of weeks but that was against 2 awful defenses.  Haden is really damn good, brown is probably in the mid-teens for WR this week. 
























 Well profootball reference has weekly stats in this format: http://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2012/week_1.htm

They also have a link to copy it in CSV format.  From there you could just convert the raw numbers into fantasy points.

As for the copying and pasting, if you don't have any programming experience try using web scrapers like this one: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-scraper/jnhgnonknehpejjnehehllkliplmbmhn?hl=en

Not sure if that specific one is good but try using something like that to save yourself from having to copy and paste everything.

Also if ya don't know how to program you should try out Python or R, both have a good community and a fair amount of tools for statistical analysis.  




 Would love to see this analysis done for previous years as well.  While this is interesting information, it is still a small sample size. 




 footballoutsiders.com does a good job rating defenses.  They also rate olines and dlines. 




 Well I traded him the previous week. I sent him, asiata, and ertz for Rodgers and Gronk.  I felt good about the trade when it happened, less good when asiata scored 3tds, okish when Gronk got a garbage time TD, slightly better now that Ryan has lost 3/5ths of the his oline (including Sam Baker).  Also a heads up for Ryan owners, he plays 1 less home game this year b/c of the london game so that's another negative for him, as he does play better at home than on the road.  Also I wouldn't bank on his WRs to stay healthy for the year either.  Julio Jones was the biggest injury risk at the WR position coming into the season: http://sportsinjurypredictor.com/top-injury-risks-2014/  




 There's that, but it isn't enough for local governments, hence all the tickets. 




 It all depends on what you can get for him of course.  Before this weeks games I was able to package him, Matt Ryan and Ertz for Gronk and Aaron Rodgers.  You could probably do better after today's game.  You've seen his best game of the year so if you want to flip him for something else go right ahead.

 No, not atm.  The graph is just sorted in alphabetical order. 




 I created [this](https://savvas.shinyapps.io/qb_shiny/) interactive graph of QB playoff performance based on DVOA since 1989.

 I recently purchased [this](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TH7T2U/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8 psc=1) HDMI to DVI adapter in order to use my Toshiba CB2 with my [QNIX 27" 1440p monitor](http://www.amazon.com/QNIX-QX2710-Evolution-LED-Monitor/dp/B00BUI44US).  I've been unable to get it to work.  I was just wondering if anyone else was able to get their CB2 working with a 1440p external display. Thanks. 




 How would I get this to work if already have Elementary OS installed via crouton? 




 The CB2's screen isn't just better based off just the higher resolution. The CB2's screen covers [98.5%of sRGB color gamut and has a Delte-E score of 1 (0 is the best)](http://www.laptopmag.com/reviews/laptops/toshiba-chromebook-2) while the Air covers [63.3% of the color gamut and has a Delta-E of 2.5.](http://www.laptopmag.com/reviews/laptops/apple-macbook-air-13-inch-2014)   




 You can run a Linux distro via crouton on the Toshiba CB2.  I'm running Elementary OS via crouton right now and runs pretty well. However any chromebook with an Intel Bay Trail processor won't be able to run Linux via Chrubuntu. 




 I don't think it's flash, I use youtube magic actions and force HTML5 playback on videos.  Most 1080p vids playback well, but there are just some that just stutter, like this one [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRqPPFREx4 index=2 list=UUXGgrKt94gR6lmN4aN3mYTg)

As for when I'm running ElementaryOS I have stuttering issues all the time when trying to run play youtube videos.
 




 Performance is just fine outside of video playback.  It can't play certain youtube videos at 1080p which is dissappointing.  It also can have some stuttering issues when playing back video on a 2nd monitor and doing something on the laptop screen.  I am looking forward to future iterations of this laptop with better CPU. 




 Yea it's pretty nice.  Love the screen and the speaker.  Elementary OS runs pretty well on this laptop. However, I do wish it was just a bit more powerful as I have had some stuttering issues with 1080p vids on youtube. 




 Yea I'm hoping everything goes well.  I was debating whether to go through Best Buy's Customer Service or Discover's.  I decided on going through Discover to see how the experience was, in order to do you what you said for next year's BF deals.  Worse comes to worse I only lose $50, which I was already willing to spend on this chromebook anyways. 




 It's silver. 




 Bought the CB2 on monday, thank god for discover price protection

 If you want to program locally it is best to install crouton and then install eclipse.  As for an online IDE you can try this: http://ideone.com/ but I can't vouch for how good it is as I haven't used it. 




 I'm not saying that there isn't a connection between the two. I do think that there is a high probability that there is some connection.  I just wanted to point out that other sports are experiencing a similar decline and that there are other possible factors in play that have led to a decline in the participation rates of those sports. 




 perhaps... 




 It's not helpful to just show info regarding one youth football league without comparing it to other leagues and other sports. There's been a general decline in youth sports, not just football.

 The ref data on basketball reference just indicates the effects of the whole crew that a ref happened to be a part of.  Keeping track of individual ref calls or non calls would allows us to get a better idea of the tendencies of each individual ref.  I just think having that information would be nice and would lead to some interesting analysis.  And I don't know about the whole mob material thing, if a ref does perform poorly he/she should be criticized the same way players are when they perform poorly.   




 Would be nice to know the name of the official who made the call. 




 It's a step in the right direction but why limit it to only the last 2 minutes of close games? 




 I can't start elementary OS. I keep getting the error: X: cannot stat /etc/X11/X (No such file or directory), aborting.

This happened after I updated my Chrome OS.  Could the update have broken my chroot?   




 I'd agree with you, but [Joey Crawford](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2SYIrUnf5Y t=1m24s) exists [so...](https://usatthebiglead.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/tim-duncan-tony-paker-guns-joey-crawford1.jpg) 




 Is there a website or dataset that keeps track of the funding for scientific studies/publications? 




 On the Tosihiba CB2 FHD Netflix doesn't give me any problems.  Youtube tends to stutter during the first couple of seconds and then is fine.  However Youtube videos that run at 60fps are unplayable.

EDIT:  In regards to the youtube stuttering, using magic actions for youtube, I enabled flash player playback which got rid of all the stuttering, even 60fps 1080p videos. 




 This is pretty cool.  Is there a an easy way of scraping the shot charts data?  I know it's possible, the guy who made [this](http://peterbeshai.com/buckets/app/#/playerView/201935_2014) was able to do it. 




 I was just trying to figure out how to do this as well and found the solution.

1. To change the default open the file manager app on chrome os. 

2. Then click on the pdf you want to open, but don't actually open it. 

3. On the bottom right of the file manager app there should be a drop down menu that allows you to select which pdf viewer to use.  You can  also change the default pdf viewer from the same menu as well.

 




 Yes! 




 Glad you enjoyed. And yeap he was real bad. 
























 Youtube loads the video up at t either 1440p or 4k. But then the video is downscaled to fit your screen.  Technically it is supposed to look better, but I can't really tell the difference. 




 I had issues with youtube videos stuttering on my Toshiba CB2.  To fix this issue I would usually force youtube to playback using flash, but now I'm [this chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/h264ify/aleakchihdccplidncghkekgioiakgal?utm_source=chrome-app-launcher-info-dialog
).  It fixed the stuttering problems I had when using HTML5 to playback 1080p 60fps videos.  

EDIT: It also seems to have resolved any stuttering issues I had playing back 1440p and 4k videos on youtube (not that it matters on a 1080p display). 




 Just a heads up you can run a linux distribution on a chromebook using crouton.  This way you can run a full operating system.  I currently use crouton to run elementaryOS and I'm able to program in Java and C++ for my classes. 




 You should try and see if you could retake the class at a local public college during the summer and transfer those credits over to your current school.  I would assume that would be more affordable, if it is doable. 




 Your welcome, I hope it's helpful.

 R has its uses in stats.  But like every programming language it has its faults.

If you want an alternative to R, may I suggest Python.

Here is the official tutorial: https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/

Here is a link to the IPython documentation, which allows you to better interact with Python:
http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/index.html


Here are some resources that will introduce you to stats using Python:

Theres also these resources for bayesian statistics using Python:

 That's fair. But by saying "there's no evidence that they are wired differently" you seem to be implying that there aren't physical differences between male and female brains. 




 There are observable differences between the brain structures of males and females.  For example women tend to have a higher percentage of grey matter, while men have more white matter.  [Here's the wikipedia page that covers the differences.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience_of_sex_differences) There's even a bit about how men and women are wired differently. 




 I use the magic actions extension and just fore player type to flash. No stuttering after that. 




 No I rarely have any problems with RAM.  If I ever do it's when I'm running Linux via crouton and I am programming using R while having a big data set loaded into RAM.  The biggest issue that I see is that when I switch over to Chrome OS, old inactive tabs will auto refresh when I switched back to viewing them.  That's pretty much it. 




 Try running those 60fps videos using flash.  I used to have issues with stuttering but then used Youtube magic extensions and set all youtube videos for Flash. 




 [Actually the nfl does admit officiating mistakes.](https://www.google.com/search?btnG=1 pws=0 q=nfl+admits+officiating+mistake) 

While I do agree the larger sample size of plays/possessions/games allows more room for error by the NBA officials, it doesn't mean they are more competent at their jobs and it doesn't mean that their bad calls don't have an equally significant impact on the game.  The bad calls nba refs make are just less obvious and their impacts are less obvious.

A few bad ticky-tack fouls on a player early on in the game does alter how they play and limit their playing time. A recent example that comes to mind is Lebron James against the Pacers in last years playoffs.  

Plus the nba empowers their refs to give technical fouls and kick guys out for "showing up the refs." Which can lead to [Joey Crawford.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2SYIrUnf5Y#t=1m25s) The nfl can give out personal foul calls but they rarely kick guys out of games, and if they do it is for throwing a punch not hurting a referee's feelings.

There was also a recent [game fixing scandal in the NBA regarding one of its refs.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_NBA_betting_scandal).  And the NBA completely absolved Tim Donaghy. Also before the NBA got Sportsvu for the whole league, the Sportsvu cameras actually collected data on the refs.  But afterwards the NBA actually stopped collecting or reporting that information. Check out this [bit for the BS report with Haralabos Voulgaris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s1TVQhDYgg#t=47m) that covers the Donaghy scandal and the Sportsvu data.  So all this hoopla over the ref transparency reports is just a bunch of bullshit.  If the NBA really cared about transparency they should not have stopped collecting or reporting the Sportvu referee data.

Here are two lists of controversies involving officiating from both leagues:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League_controversies#Controversial_calls
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association_criticisms_and_controversies#Conspiracies

In the end officiating is equally terrible in both sports. It could be because it is a hard job, or it's hard to judge good or bad officiating (we seem to notice bad officiating but we rarely compliment or notice good officiating),  maybe the refs are just incompetent, or some combo of each. I would like both leagues to be more transparent when reporting on referee performance and I want both leagues to lessen the impact of bad officiating on the games.  But that is hard to do and probably unlikely when both leagues want to constantly change/add/enforce rules that lead to less/safer physical contact between players for the sake of increased offensive output.  Because we all know more offense means more viewers, which means more revenue for the leagues.
 





























 First, what do you mean by power? And how can we compare the power of both? 




 I used the Toshiba CB2 FHD this past semester for my OOP Java and OOP C++ classes and it worked out ok for me. Eclipse was a bit laggy, but I usually found myself working in Sublime Text 3.  This summer I've been using it to program in Python (using IPython notebooks) and R (using RStudio) and it has been working well for me.  My main issue is the limited on board storage, even though I've got a 64GB sd which does help a bit, I would have loved to have had 32GB in onboard storage vs the 16GB .  Oh I'm running elementaryOS Luna (Ubuntu 12.04) via crouton. 




 You could also use [chrome magic actions](http://www.chromeactions.com/) and enable MP4/AVC.  That should get rid of the stutter, plus you get a bunch of other useful features. 




 [Here is the link to the study.](http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2319711) 




 It wasn't just the media.  Main push actually came from the players.  If the NBA didn't do anything there was a good chance the players would protest and not play. 




 Do you have any reading suggestions that do a good job blending theory and practice? I'm starting my summer break so I would love to do at least one summer project involving computer vision (and motion/speed tracking).  




 Everything works well if you have the right extensions set up.  I made a thread regarding fixing some of the stuttering for Youtube videos here: https://pay.reddit.com/r/chromeos/comments/34p7ru/fix_for_youtube_60fps_stuttering/

Check it out it you are interested.

I've been using since about the end of November and it has done everything I've needed it to do.  I installed a linux distro to use for my programming course this semester.  It's been fine running everything I need.  I've only had some lag issues with one of IDE's (Eclipse) I've used in class.

The main complaint I have is that the build quality is not good.  The two corner screws under the laptop, by the screen, are gone.  They would constantly become unscrewed. I lost the first two that came with the laptop and two others that I replaced them with.  So now I just don't even bother.  

But that screen.  Can't find a laptop with a better screen at this price.  Just a heads there can be some color shifting when viewing it from certain angles, like from the top left or top right.  Looking at the screen directly from the left or right doesn't really cause any serious color shifting.

 Not sure if this will help as it pertains to hiring scientists, but maybe you can get some ideas from it: http://treycausey.com/hiring_data_scientists.html 




 It may not be as speculative, but it is just as petty.  As much as we all love football, it's still an entertainment business.  Both TMZ and Schefter both report information regarding the entertainment world, it's just that TMZ reports on a wider variety of entertainment businesses while Schefter focuses on the NFL. 




 I was using Magic Actions to force flash player on youtube, that resolved most of the stuttering.  Thanks for the tip about turning MP4/AVC on, I'll check it out. 




 I don't have any issues with Netflix.
