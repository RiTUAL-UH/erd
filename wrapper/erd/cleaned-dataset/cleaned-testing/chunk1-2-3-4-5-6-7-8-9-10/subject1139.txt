 The movie is Garden of Words and the setting is Shinjuku Gyoen in Tokyo. 









 Welcome to the Space Show. 




 RahXephon's "My Blue Friend" episode had me all teary eyed. 




 This is the Kamishikimi Kumanoimasu Shrine in Japan. I first saw it as the setting for the movie [Hotarubi no Mori e](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grTUkLgHwGM).

 5 cm per second. 




 The Rubinsky and Terran plots could have been done better towards the end. They were intriguing plots initially but by the fourth season they lost a lot of steam and didn't add much tension. It felt tacked on just to add some conflict.

Improvements in animation and ship design would also make the show better. Just imagine Walter von Schenkopp fight scenes with better animation and a bit more flare.

 Mir should work on his clinch game or just avoid the clinch altogether. Big Nog (2nd fight), Cormier and Carwin also bullied him in the clinch. 




 Leg extension, glute kickback machine and hamstring curls. 














 Bicyclists in NYC run the red light all the fucking time. I wouldn't even feel bad if I witness one of them run a red light then get hit by a bus. 




 No. His PB is 13.46 the 6th best time in the final is 13.43.

13.46 is not even a good enough time to qualify an American hurdler into the Olympics since America has quite a depth of talent in that event. For example the top three times in the 2012 USA Oympic trials are 12.93, 12.98 and 13.08.

 Or he scored the first round a 10-7. 




 Everyone's screaming about 30-25 but the 30-27's are bad too. How those judges did not score round one a 10-8 is mind boggling. 




 Two knockdowns and some beat downs in between those knockdowns, yeah pretty much a 10-8 but you never know with these judges. 









 Go home and be a family man.

 NFL TV deals are nationwide. The league itself signs those deals with CBS, FOX, NBC, and ESPN then redistribute some of that money to the teams. In the NBA and MLB the TV deals are regional. The team itslef negotiate those deals, not the league, which makes revenue sharing difficult because teams are looking out for their own. 




 [Wolf Children](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf_Children). 









 It made me feel so many emotions; joy, melancholy, sympathy, worried and relief. 



















 Pistol squats. Doing weighted pistols for 3x8, one leg at a time is freaking exhausting. 




 For those unaware, Shinkai also wrote a manga and a novel adaptation. The manga has great extensive character development on Kanae, Akari and Risa. IMO the novel has a better depiction of adult Takaki than the manga and the movie.

[In the novel adult Takaki wasn't that hung up on Akari, some memories and feelings would pop up but he didn't hold on to them like he did in the manga and the movie. He even admitted to falling in love with other women. But being heart broken at such an early age seemed to have left a lasting mark on him which led to him giving up on relationships when things get tough.](/spoiler) 




 It had a happy ending but what stuck out the most was the sad part. The scene where Asuna was running on the shallow river really got to me. 




 [] (/s "You've got to keep in mind how old they were and their situation. They were just thirteen, dealing with such strong emotions at such a young age could make one apprehensive and scared. Add the fact that they were about to move away from each other which makes expressing their feelings even more difficult. I think most adults would have trouble with the same situation.")

[] (/s "As for keeping in touch, they did try but the letters/texts were just not enough. The manga went over this really well, they both just shied away from the difficulties the distance provided. It's hard to expect two teenagers to try their best to make a long distance relationship work.") 




 I rewatched it a couple of days ago and I had to close that youtube link only a few seconds in. 




 http://i.imgur.com/m6dzIUl.gif 




 I recommend reading the manga also. Perhaps read it prior to rewatching the movie. The manga has added dialogue and scenes that does a great job of developing the characters better than the movie which also makes it all the more depressing.

 Space Battleship Yamato 2199 and Kyousogiga. I love the 70's vibe, the militaristic sound and the use of brass instruments in Yamato 2199...really got me pumped for the huge battles. While Kyousogiga's music hit that sentimental spot. 




 Space Battleship Yamato 2199 














 Nyahaha
 









 The series is set in the same universe as [The Princess and the Pilot movie](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qomwjPIerM). 









 I love how Gintama manges to make juvenile humor funny again. These are the type of humor that you feel like you have moved on from as you got older but then you see something like Neo Armstrong Cyclone Jet Armstrong Cannon and Peen-san and you just can't help but burst out laughing. 




 The whole harem arc. Also any Shinpachi romance arc is hilarious. 




 Resident Evil is a popular Japanese made game so there's a decent brand recognition.  









 The filler and non-filler episodes prior to the Kyoto arc weren't good either but the ones past the Kyoto arc really are an absolute bore. Well I guess the the Shougo Arc was some what decent. 




 To anyone who played the VN, which route do you think is the anime taking?

I don't mind being spoiled. 




 Despite being selfish and not doing what's best for both Touma and Haruki, Setsuna is still the most honest one of the group therefore my best girl.

This show keeps going through tonal shifts. From lighthearted beginnings of a hero, to full blown tokusatsu cheese then to something dark.

I hope we get some background info on King Torture because right now he comes off as a random evil genius.

 Touma's train stop is at Iwazu-cho which is in Okazaki. She flew from Okazaki to Tokyo. 




 I think Haruki is overcompensating. He realizes he has feelings for Touma which makes him feel guilty so he compensates for that by rushing his relationship with Setsuna hoping it would drown out whatever he feels for Touma. 









 I'm so confused by this show right now. I thought the show was starting to hit its stride in ep. 6 and in the second half of 7. I was starting to have a grasp on what direction the show is going then this wacky tonal shift happened.

I'm just hoping for a payoff that would make sense and justify this tonal shift in a gratifying manner.

 Gintama has some heart wrenching moments too. [This dog story](http://vimeo.com/38013872) was such a tearjerker, almost as good as Futurama's Jurassic Bark. 









 Holy shit I don't know how to respond to this.

I was half expecting the show to go Steins;Gate on us, which means having a slow build up leading to shit hitting the fan really fast but I didn't expect the show to go full blown superhero.

I'll go with a wait and see approach before I react to this. 




 Robert de flato 


































 Space Battleship Yamato 2199 is my runaway AOTY. 









 [They're following the Gintama strategy](http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/070/4/9/gintama_yaoi_motivational_by_sweetshounenai-d3bdrp2.jpg)

edit: FYI Gin and Goto share the same voice actor. 




 Oh man, this episode was hilarious. It also did a fine job of showing Masayoshi's dedication and pure intentions in a charming way without coming off corny or overly preachy.

Another thing I liked was Mari's little slip of the tongue about letting off steam, I guess that confirms she's really in it for thrill and excitement.

Also Gotobro exuded so much broness in this episode.

I need more Sumi screentime. 














 This was an excellent episode but then again most things about Yamato 2199 are excellent. More people should watch this show! 




 Reaper and Pushing Daisies, both have the quirkiness and eccentricity that might be better expressed in anime form. Also Better Off Ted as a SOL anime.

Maybe I'm just mentioning shows I felt were canceled so abruptly.  









 Moe waiting for a kiss from Mari was funny.

I like how both Mari and Masayoshi hit a lull in their superhero career and how they dealt with it differently. Masayoshi's passion for heroism was starting to fade and he was becoming jaded, then he realized he's doing this not for fun, not for the hero ego boost but for justice. While Mari was just getting bored since she has little purpose other than entertainment so she dealt with her boredom by upping the ante of her antics.

Looks like both Goto and Hazama will find a common sense of purpose and really start working together. 














 I'm surprised there were no Faye Valentine versions. The Haruhi bunny costume one was the best. 














 as expected akira loses to mori

I'm glad they didn't drag that out into a love triangle. The romance was unobtrusive and served as a good complement to the main story. 




 The Walking Dead is mainstream. The ratings for last season were high and this season's are even better. 




 Highly recommended anime. [Watch it here.](http://kissanime.com/Anime/Space-Battleship-Yamato-2199) 














 If the gif can fit in that 2mb limit without being a gif for ants or a grainy mess due to low image quality. 









  I mean, this show is about a treasure hunt basically, but this episode didn't include any part of the treasure-hunting! I'm feeling like the show doesn't really know how much time they should spend on characterization that is not the best I've ever seen but still, fairly standard.

Totally agreed with this. The lack of balance between character development and storytelling leads to pretty bad pacing. As a result the treasure just conveniently shows up instead of being discovered. Then there are these random action scenes that just pop up out of nowhere with very little set up.

Despite these glaring flaws I can't get myself to drop this show. 




 Crotch shots is cheap humor but the show somehow made it work. I guess the character, sound effects and the delivery are what got a laugh out of me.

I'm still enjoying this but it's the Goto and Masayoshi dialogue that made the show engaging and it's kind of veering away from that. Also it feels a bit directionless, other than character introductions the main story has been stagnant. I hope we see more progression since most of the main cast have been established.

 Some of the more recent Ghibli movies are pretty underrated.

From Up on Poppy Hill [(Watch it here)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQD4VH4Drvk)

Arrietty 




 **Wolf Children.** It's a sentimental and emotionally moving movie about a young mother raising her two kids that are part wolf in the Japanese countryside.

[Here's some stills](http://imgur.com/a/7yBMB)

[Watch it here.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7H0Vcl8kIw)

Also check out Le jour des corneilles (The Day Of Crows). It's a very sweet french animation movie. 














 With that much muscle mass I highly doubt he neglected developing glamour muscles like the chest. Some people are just lacking genetically in certain areas. 









 Synopsis:

Hana is a 19-year-old student who falls in a "fairy-tale like" love with a "wolf man". Over the course of the 13-year story Hana gives birth to two children - older sister Yuki, and younger brother Ame, or "Snow and Rain". At first the family quietly lives in the city trying to hide their wolf heritage, but when the "wolf man" suddenly dies Hana makes the decision to move to a rural town, far from their previous city life. 









 They would all get it...get congratulations for graduating.

As for non-Ghibli movies I'd recommend [Hotarubi no Mori e](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grTUkLgHwGM) and Wolf Children. 














 Squeeze play.

 Turn on the close caption. 
























 Three point shooting is horrendous for both teams but the Nets are actually getting good looks. 




 Classic Mushishi bitter-sweetness.

I love the metaphorical use of the cold and snow to express Toki's feeling of numbness after losing his sister. Then use Tae's warmth to express the feeling of caring and comfort that helped Toki to move on. Very simple but well executed. 




  believe-in-yourself motivational nonsense

Sure it's overplayed in the sports genre (across all mediums) but I wouldn't call it nonsene. Top athletes don't reach the highest level of their craft without self-confidence, self-motivation and being pushed by someone. 




 In terms of romance:

Cross Game

Nana

Honey and Clover 




 Chaika could be another case of the lesser hyped Bones' show being the better one. Too bad it doesn't have the Noragami production values. 




 Sigh. No English subs. I was hoping to add this to my Spring schedule. Oh well, I'll just watch the movie series whenever it comes up in my backlog. 




 Shedding manly tears has been passed down the Armstrong line for generations. 




 Oh boy, I started welling up when I read the "God please..." line. The notion that's she's begging in her diary to remember all these memories was just so sad. 




 This show has an AMAZING soundtrack. 




 The way this show presents different story elements is so disjointed. There's just too much stuff going and the show is not doing much in a way of making sense of them. It was kind of forgivable after the 1st episode but after the 2nd one it becomes worrisome.

I hope there's some sort of pay-off here that would justify the chaotic storytelling.

 




 Mushishi is so good at building human relationships and drama in just 20 minutes. 




 I hope this convinces Sunrise to make another season of Gintama. 




 Better hops than VC but VC throws it down with more authority. 




 Holy crap that episode must have been expensive. The animation, background and character detail, and the lighting/shadowing were all on point. The slow-mo stuff also looked smooth and that means more frames of animation which of course is expensive.

That flashback was really really well done. Great editing and timely use of good music. That might be one of the best implementation of flashbacks I've seen in anime. 




 I think he's like a more evil version of Takamura. 




 That gave me bit of Kiki's Delivery Service vibe. A magical country girl unfamiliar with the city environment. 




 Too much going on for a first episode and a bit overwhelming.

Laying out a bunch of story elements in the first episode is a neat idea though. 




 That hand to hand combat looked good. Nice choreography. 




 Brewers have a really nice ballpark and a very fan friendly atmosphere and amenities. Also people like to go out in the Spring/Summer and baseball can be seen as a leisurely outdoor pastime. Keeping those in mind, with the right marketing you can get people to show up at the ballpark for a mediocre team. 




 Well, that was quick. 




 A relaxing episode about sake. A nice way to reintroduce the show before delving into the bitter-sweet stories.

I also liked how this episode adds to the mushi mythos. 




 /r/anime has been doing seasonal polls since Fall 2012, I think. Here's the [Fall 2013 Poll.](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1uxekm/ranime_aoty_2013_aots_fall_2013_poll_results/)

 Read the first post of that thread. Or you can read the article I posted.

Japanese animation sales rose 6.5% to 78.99 billion yen (about US$768.4 million) in 2013 to its highest total in six years. Sales of foreign animation for the general public and children were 6.191 billion yen (US$60.2 million), and foreign and domestic animation sales combined were 85.17 billion yen (US$828.5 million).

 Spring and Summer seasons always get the good stuff. 




 What a scare. Should've tried harder to deny Monta from getting the ball. 




 Livingston got away with a lot of grabbing and pulling there. 




 Damn Caesar is OP. 




 The manga sales are excellent so the Japanese do like this type of story. It's just not the type of series that garners fandom and get people to buy blurays and merchandise.

Also this is late night anime so ratings don't matter.  









 I was half expecting to see the Gintama spoof of who wants to be a millionaire. 




 And it's mostly fairly well known animes. These lists would be more interesting if they're recommending niche shows like Otana Joshi, Flag, Beast Player Erin and etc. 




 This arc has been amazing.

Ippo and Silver Spoon have been providing some quality writing and character drama for the past few weeks. 




 Personally I found Courtesan of a Nation to be the best arc. 




 I love how you left out the fact that prior to the takedown Hendricks was landing consecutive punches and kicks on a gassed out and hurt Lawler. 




 The intro to the this episode was great. A prime example of how this show can seamlessly transition from serious moments to comedic ones.

The writing, pacing and character progression have been superb. The dialogue and the way characters react are believable and genuinely heartfelt. This is one of the few shows that handle emotional moments in a natural and sincere way, right along with shows like Mushishi, Cross Game, Natsume and a few others. 









 All of a sudden this show turns into a psychological thriller. I think the second half has handled the transition between tonal shifts a lot better than the first half. 









 This felt good after the way the Nets lost to Raps in the last game. 




 Blatche with some horrendous defense. 




 Lowry is really pushing his luck with the refs. Surprisingly they have been patient with him. 




 Ugh, I was really hoping it wouldn't do the "beat some sense into him" cliche. That was just bad writing because Ignacio barely exists as a character and all of a sudden he's playing a significant role in the MC's life this late in the season. It also robbed us of a possible good interaction between Kal and Ariel since it really should've been Ariel talking some sense into him. Really, the best thing this anime has going for it is the relationship between Ariel and Kal, and in a very important moment it decided to go away from it.

Pretty disappointed with this show since I really, really liked The Princess and the Pilot. 




 I find myself sometimes saying "Oy, Oy, Oy" like Gintoki does. 




 Nobunaga you spectacular bastard. I love the over the top confidence, the hubris and the grandiose. It's such a nice change of pace from other MCs.  




 This episode made me want a serious period drama anime. 




 Nets broadcast team can be hilarious at times. 

I want to see how an Ian Eagle and JVG duo would work out. 




 But damn, you can't just end it in the middle of a **well deserved ass whoopin.**

I dunno about that, the guy just found out the girl he loves is partly responsible for his parents' death. His emotional response is completely understandable. If this goes the "beat some sense into him" route then it would be some pretty bad writing.

 Oh man, I love Nodame. Great Romcom. 




 I love that little bit of introspection by Hachiken about running away might have been a good thing but it doesn't mean the problem just disappears.

Also for anyone who enjoyed the baseball part, I recommend that you go watch **Cross Game!** 




 This might be my favorite fight in the series. I really like how it emotionally escalates right along with the intensity of the fight. 














 This show is making me realize how uncreative I was during my toy playing days. 









 Even though Yukine is being a little brat, I still feel bad for him. It doesn't exactly help that Yato is as personable and empathetic as a cardboard box, and is not being a good friend/parental figure to Yukine.

After a few episodes that made me want to smack Yukine, this episode actually made me sympathize or at the very least empathize with him. Also you're right about Yato, despite his good intentions of wanting to reform Yukine and not give up on him, he really hasn't handled the situation gracefully. 




 Yukine seems to have some abandonment issues. Nora showing up and making Yukine think Yato could leave him for her seems to be the catalyst to this whole mess.

Yato knows this and doesn't want to give up on him maybe for atonement, or maybe out of compassion. 




 I like Eagle. I found myself rooting for him.

That cliff hanger though. 




 He should hire a PR person. 




 Space Battleship Yamato 2199 and Garden of Words. Both are excellent. 




 Space Battleship Yamato 2199. It's an excellent space opera not just for an anime but across other mediums. Also, IMO the far and away best anime in 2013.

Go watch it!

 Damn, shit just got real serious all of a sudden. I approached this as a "turn my brain off and just enjoy" anime but this episode is making me think otherwise. 




 Robot Family is hilarious, best episode so far. 




 That was kind of a lame fight, no tension whatsoever. I understand it's a set up episode but a whole episode about a dominant win is boring. 




 That Mari and Mizuki argument is really well written and acted. The dialogue genuinely expressed anger and frustration...then we see Moe wearing a paper bag and then yuri. Haha, only this show can troll you like that. 









 The goofiness of this episode reminded a bit of Gintama, especially the [manboarding bit](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAqo1mNq15A). I didn't mind it at all and thought it was amusing until the exposition dump, which came off as forced and felt like last minute story telling. 




 There's been too many flashbacks, the show might have just as well started from the very beginning then just do a time skip. I think the pacing would've been better that way but obviously that would eliminate the twist.

Those aerial scenes looked good, pretty obvious that's where a lot of the budget is going. 




 Caesar is a big believer in ~~love~~ kidnap at first sight. 




 I've read that the American companies were overpaying for licenses with total disregard for quality but hearing some of those titles really put things in perspective on how crazy the bubble got.

 I wonder if the BD is going to have a less censored version of the bath scene just like Monogatari did...you know for science. 




 The Japanese aren't big time purchasers of DVD/BDs so it makes sense to maximize price in a limited market.


This [ANN article](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2012-03-07) explains it better:

The High Prices... Explained!

To a Westerner, the Japanese DVD market seems horribly overpriced. With the average disc running over 7,000 (US$92) and only containing 2-4 episodes of a series, the cost of collecting a single show can easily run several hundred dollars -- more than many American fans spend in a single year. 

The prices actually stem from a business practice we used to have in America, too: rental pricing. Basically, back in the dawn of the home video business, the industry was constructed in a way where "niche" releases were only meant to sell a few thousand copies, mostly to video rental shops. Prices were high (typically $89.95 in America), but video shops benefited from having a wide and semi-exclusive selection of movies that normal people would never pay for. At those prices, only a few thousand sales could mean over a million dollars of revenue. Initially, video industry people didn't think there was much of a market in selling to collectors. 

But the fans proved them wrong. Otaku of all kinds (not just anime fans) started buying the videotapes and laserdiscs, and they bought them at those high prices that were intended just for video stores. There was no reason to lower it. **In fact, there were a few experiments to drop the price to a more affordable amount, but that usually resulted in a slight increase in sales -- not enough to make up for the drop in revenue.**

When you think about it, that makes sense. Most Japanese people live in much smaller homes, and with many more people than their Western counterparts. In most cases, it simply doesn't make sense for Japanese consumers to build a big home media library. Only the hardcore fans of a particular product will usually want to bother owning a tape or DVD, and everyone else relies on rental shops. Media is a specialty market, not a mass-market one, so prices have stayed astronomically high. 

The Japanese Otaku's desire to own anime even at high prices had an unexpected effect: as the rest of the economy tanked and video stores stopped buying every new video release, the otaku kept buying pretty much everything that got released. Before long, the few thousand fans that bought anime DVDs were supporting nearly the entire budget of a show. Even as the rest of the Japanese home video industry lowered their prices to varying degrees, anime stayed at the same high price. It's simply the only way most shows can ever make a profit. 




 Mr. Justice is a spammer.

This show is INSANE, INSANE, INSANE. The whole From Beyond thing being an elaborate hoax doesn't really explain the PM going all super saiyan.

 I feel the same. 




 I'm gonna be avoiding Sportcenter tonight, don't wanna see that ending again.

I wanted this win bad not just for the standings but for more momentum heading into the games against OKC and Indiana. 




 Fuck. Fuck. That fucking hurt. Fuck. 




 I wonder how much change the Wind Revolution brought. The class divide still seems to be prevalent and the end result was a transfer of power from one blue blood to another. 









 All of a sudden romcom love triangle. The absurdity is pretty entertaining.

 Eh? Nothing that has transpired so far made me think that she should die and that's the only way to end things. There's still so many unanswered questions about her role. 

Killing off a characters can be cliche also and if not done properly can be seen as a cheap attempt for a tear jerker. 









 The enemy has some faulty designed mechas lol.

Betrothed to his sister and now to a loli. Also with a cross dressing love interest on the side. Nobunaga is like Araragi with a mecha. 




 That's a fabulous pose. 














 The underwear song is pretty catchy. That Satan skit is pretty amusing, it got me with the "please deliver me from paper" line.  




 Damn, just reading this speculation hit right in the feels. 




 This show with its roller coaster ride of tonal shifts is playing with my emotions. 









 The bomber being linked to the teacher/bullying felt tacked on. This episode didn't do as good of a job as the first episode in terms of intertwining different cases together. 




 Usagi Drop, Honey Clover and Cross Game are all on Hulu. 




 [In the OP there's a little girl cuddled up with little Kal-el.](http://i.imgur.com/AOmivlF.jpg) Hmmm, I wonder if that's Claire. If that's true and she's also Nina Viento then this might get interesting.  




 I hope it avoids the imouto route but I guess it fits in with the insanity. Maybe the term "sister" means something else lol.

 The best they can do is being done already and that is being available on Crunchy, Hulu, Netflix and having some shows in toonami. Late night anime used to be available on cable TV like Sci-fi Channel and Tech-TV/G4 but those channels are niche. Even in those niche channels anime couldn't draw a decent enough audience to be kept on air.

The only anime that hit mainstream are children's shows like Pokemon, Digimon, DBZ and etc. That's back when children's shows in general were popular, when Kid's WB, Fox Kids and afternoon Toonami existed. Those days are long gone.

Non-sitcom animation for adults in general has always been niche. Archer is on a relevant cable network and in its four seasons has never reached 2 million viewers. If an American made animation of that type can't hit mainstream then anime doesn't have much of a chance



  




 Late night anime has always been niche. Obviously there has been a few exceptions like Eva, AoT, Haruhi, Madoka and a few others but for the most part the audience will always be limited due to the time slot. 




 Ononoki with that posed look. 




 Yeah, the slice of life stuff is a nice breather or palette cleanser in between the intense fights. 




 That's adorable. I'd watch a show about a girl and her pet alpaca.

 I enjoy the roller coaster ride but some of the transitionary episodes in between the tonal changes are a bit unexciting. 




 The humor is kind of dull but I see some potential due to the unique premise. Some comedy shows take some time to pick up steam like Gintama which took me about 3-5 episodes to really get into.

I'll give this the 3 episode treatment and if it improves I might keep watching. 




 Did the show just referenced Cross Game, because I think it did and it put a smile on my face.

 I like how the three jobs merged into one, I thought that was clever. The characters have a good dynamic between them which produced some really funny moments. Then of course, there's also the action and the music. Best premiere so far this season, looks like it's going to be a fun show.

Cross Game (series) - sports anime but the drama is excellent



 




 Watch The Princess and the Pilot, this series is a spin-off of that movie. It has the romance in the sky vibe that's a bit reminiscent of Laputa: Castle in the Sky. 




 The anime is [Anohana](http://www.hulu.com/anohana-the-flower-we-saw-that-day). The location is Chichibu. 




 man that romance was a little rushed with that "grab her as she falls ,stare into each others eyes and embrance" scene.

Yeah, that escalated way too quickly and came off kind of cheesey. A nice dialogue where they share a few laughs would have suffice in establishing the romance.

 









 Those CG mechs didn't look so good. The show's world building seems fairly interesting though. 




 I guess that was alright. The animation was great towards the end but the humor fell flat with the exception of the circle joke. 




 Kino's Journey season 2, please. 




 I was so happy when I noticed it's a double episode. The show sold Sawamura's bait pretty well. 
























 I also always liked the [imagery](http://www.reddit.com/r/Mushishi/comments/27977b/mushishi_episode_6_cinematography/) in Mushishi. 




 This felt like a mix between Harmonie and Chihayafuru. 




 That's most likely right. Ship sunk. 




 Aww, Daichi's lady friend has his jersey number as a key-chain. 




 I guess it could be argued that Machida should've turned it up earlier but I think the reason he was able to gain momentum was because Weidman started to fade in the 4th and couldn't apply the same amount of pressure. 




 That was endearing. I like how Naru's behavior put to light Handa's flaws to himself -- too prideful to apologize and too enclosed in his comfort zone.

Hopefully this turns out well since I've been itching for a SOL about an adult and they're rare to come by. 




 I'm pretty hyped about the super-duper awesome genius prodigies matching up against each other. 




 In this episode: exposition

Is this suppose to be a bad thing? Or do we really want things happening without a proper set-up and build-up a la Captain Earth.

I think the exposition was delivered well either through the flow of character interactions or background dialogue (radio). 




 Prior to the Royals there were the 2006 Diamondbacks with Justin Upton, Stephen Drew, Conor Jackson, Carlos Quentin, Carlos Gonzalez and Chris Young. Quentin and Gonzalez were used to get Haren. Their pitching prospects aren't worth mentioning hence the Haren trade.

2007 and 2011 were the only good years they had. D-backs and Royals show how fickle talent development could be. Even the Rays took years to figure it out. 









 It's freakin excellent. My AOTY last year and will go down as one of my all time favorites. I'm glad that this will give it a bit more exposure. 




 Crunchyroll webplayer definitely needs some work.

The PS3 app was absolutely horrendous a few months ago but after an update it has been fine. 




 Looks fine to me too. Better animation, better camera work, better effects.

 The OST is ace. [My favorite track.](http://youtu.be/1QR6LJuv6sc)

Also an underrated anime. The 1st season took a while to find its stride but the 2nd season was great and more than makes up for it. It had some of the most emotionally charged fight scenes I've seen. Also well choreographed and animated.
 




 They made four seasons of Natsume Book of Friends. 




 To me episode 18 was the turning point of the show. It turned from a funny show to a "I laughed so hard that my sides hurt" type of show. 




 I thought this might be Mushishi's version of a nature documentary but instead it's just Ginko getting swindled lol. I loved the folklore vibe of the whole episode.

Also Ginko walking around in circles reminded of episode 14, when he got lost in the bamboo forest. That episode was really sad.

 I feel there's been too many practice episodes. Some good, some just okay but it does get a bit monotonous. I think a change of scenery and activity while maintaining the volleyball-centric story would be a good palette cleanser. 




 Near the end of the last episode there was a short scene of Kaori sitting in the dark and her diary on her desk without anything new written on it. I thought that was ominous but it seems despite her set-back and all the negative memories coming back, Kaori is still bravely pushing forward. But now Hase...we need intervention! 




  Hase's just overthinking it as per usual

I think that's quite the opposite. He usually follow his emotions impulsively (with both negative and positive results). Right now he's feeling scared, so his instinctive response is to avoid the situation. If he actually thought things through he would've arrived to a logical conclusion that it's best for Kaori's recovery for them to stay "special" friends.  




 Rory seems like a nice guy and all but Rogan's constant verbal fellatio of him is really irritating and makes me want to see him get knocked out by Hendricks. 




 [Anime VS Real Life](http://m.imgur.com/a/AfIsv)

If you're an anime fan interested in cinematography: [link](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com) 




 I think I will upvote anything Gintama related. 




 So Sidonia did not encounter a Gauna for a hundred years. Then Nagate surfaces and almost right away a Gauna shows up.

The Captain predicted that the Council would want Nagate dead so she purposely navigated Sidonia into Gauna territory so she can sortie him and somewhat appease the Council. Although not ideal, this situation fits her strategy of defeating the Gauna instead of running away, with Nagate as her ace just like the way she pictured Hiroki should have been. This is also why she doesn't give a shit about the Kabi's attracting Gaunas.

Also I'm speculating Ochiai threw away the Kabis in order to force the Council to use his Gauna-Human hybrid as a weapon since it can kill Gaunas without a Kabi. 




 I'm more curious if the anime would boost the manga sales. It's a bit concerning that the older volumes didn't make the top 50 in the last few weeks of rankings. Unless they're not available.

 Those people need to experience cramping up. I don't care how mentally tough you are, you're not gonna will your body to move when cramps have immobilized it. 









 This episode has a such a gloomy feel to it. The same sort of melancholic feeling I get when I watch 5 cm per second.

Hase gets clean up duty. His crepe date then goes to hell. He loses special friends status. Fujimiya seems to have stopped writing in her diary. The street light then forebodingly flickers off on Hase. All of these happened in a span of one day.

Being Hase truly is suffering. 




 Darker than Black: Gemini of the Meteor. The second season exists, just accept it!


 




 The way Shaft used the song was underwhelming.

The story about Ayano and the orphans, the story of the Monster, the Snake's schemes and how Kano fits in all of this were awkwardly put together. There was no flow whatsoever.

I was hoping for a jigsaw puzzle story that would cleverly put the pieces together but with only three episodes left I would not get my hopes up that the show can pull that off. 
 




 The Captain's super secret facility needs to be more secretive.

I really like the sequence where as Tanikaze becomes a bigger hero so does his obsession with Guana Hoshijiro. The sliding glass barriers was a nice touch. This is a really well directed show. Hopefully, Kobun Shizuno gets more quality material to work with in the future.
 




 Nice character development. Been waiting for something like this, hopefully the show would build on it. The show is fun but a little bit of depth doesn't hurt.

Short supply of magic fuel seems like a sign of rationing for war. That's a nice touch and adds to the world building. 









 Watch the remake, Space Battleship Yamato 2199. It's amazing. 




 [Knights of Sidonia](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2014/05/knights-of-sidonia-episode-8.html). 




 First volume sold almost 6,000 in its first week. I was hoping for more but it actually still out-performed the [projected sales](http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1 hl=en ie=UTF8 nv=1 rurl=www.google.com sl=ja tl=en u=http://www27392u.sakura.ne.jp/show.cgi%3Fn%3DB00J2GGZ5C usg=ALkJrhgoECCiZRNruKB_hdEHEg-cIKnjvQ) based on the Amazon Ranking Stalker. The projected sales for the later volumes are higher but I dunno how accurate that is. 




 I think all the action scenes which there are plenty of, and some of the more important non-action scenes are animated at full 24 fps or done "on ones." The rest of the non-action stuff I think are done on twos with maybe the exception of the earlier episodes which are noticeably choppier. 




 [I think this epitomizes Hase's feelings at the end of this episode.](http://gfycat.com/HighRashClingfish) 




 The show is really pushing it with the teasing and the bait   switch romance. It's giving me Touch flashbacks. I should be bothered by it but the show is so damn heartwarming that the gimmick just comes off as amusing. 




 It's just part of the process, a painful one.

 AoT animation was even more inconsistent than KoS. The first half of that show was littered with stills and some of them out of context to the dialogue. There were even [unfinished](http://media.animevice.com/uploads/1/13547/659701-2hmdkci.jpg) portions and the studio [apologized](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-05-09/attack-on-titan-staff-apologizes-for-unfinished-episodes-on-3-stations) for some of them.

Also, in general, anime shows are animated in low framerates. We're talking about 8-12 fps or sometimes lower. KoS isn't really any worse than any anime in terms of FPS, it just looks more jarring when applied to CG. Just imagine any Pixar movie rendered at 8 fps and it would look more noticeable than most animes.

KoS's frame rate has gotten better though and action always looked fluid. 




 Only ones I know that were clear about couples having sex:

**NANA.** Also much of the romance centers around adults who are already in a relationship. It's great and much different than most romance animes, I highly recommend it.

**Otona Joshi no Anime Time.** Four different stories about four different women. It deals with adults so the themes are mature; single working woman, unhappy marriages, and dysfunctional family. 

**ef: a tale of memories.** Teen romance with the common anime trait of characters unable to commit. The characters are well written though.

There's also White Album 2 and Clannad. 




 "My only regret is that I have...LeBronitis"

-Lance Stephenson  




 Eh? I'm just making a general statement on the /a/ topic and not comparing the two communities. 




 ITT: couples who need to just fuck already

That's almost every anime with any sort of romance. 









 Emiru died because the admonition infection has spread. She was infected because of her deep feeling of despair and resentment. 














 I for one want Lance Stephenson to keep on talking. This is entertaining. 




 [Manga](/s "I didn't quite rage but it was definitely frustrating. I just hope there's a development in the characters that would justify hitting the reset button. I'm also wary of a possible love triangle involving Hajime. I wouldn't mind using him to push Hase in the right direction but I don't want a drama built around a love triangle") 




 Dammit Hase just admit to yourself that you like her. I guess Shogo is going to have to coax it out of him, like always.

This episode set things up so well, much better than the manga. [Manga Spoiler](/s "What happens next is really going to hurt. It would also really frustrate some people since with only four episodes left we most likely won't see a payoff that would justify such a huge setback")

 




 Hinata's energy gets me hyped up. I really like how most of the characters play off of that energy or just with each other in general.

This episode did sports speeches really well. Those speeches a lot of the time feel obligatory and contrived just like they did in Episode 4. In this episode they felt really natural and flowed with the story and dialogue. 

Also the OST if amazing.

[This sequence at end was great](http://imgur.com/a/3JNtj). 




 Stephenson is averaging almost 44 min/game. The guy is being run ragged. 




 Tatsuya being ludicrously OP and amazing at everything is weirdly entertaining and amusing. 




 The nightmares that Shintaro seems to be having are the intros in Episode 1 and 5, the ones with him and Ayano talking.

Also we finally get a connection between the "Monster" and the rest of the cast. The teacher, who's also Ayano's father seems to be involved also. Maybe they're the family?

Eternity seems to be a theme here. The monster is immortal, Ene woke up in a body that's practically immortal, Haruka seems to have been granted an immortal body and Ayano seems to exists in a time and space where she's eternal. 




 I love the use of rain as an analogue for her tears. The parallel between the drifter mushi and Teru's life was also an elegant analogy. Mushishi really excels at these type of things.

There's some awkward editing in this episode though. The way the flashbacks were done was a bit jarring. 









 We finally get the overall picture of the show which is to rebuild in the Rem star system but the Captain thinks it's not that simple. Looks like the political/social turmoil will get fleshed out more with the departing ceremony. 

Man, the cinematography and editing in this show is absolutely top notch. It even managed to make the death scene look beautiful.

[Screenshots](http://imgur.com/a/aoeFH)

 




 In the flashback in Episode 2 when as a kid Smile said he wanted to be like Peco, I don't think he meant in terms of skill and talent. I don't think he saw him as a hero in that way either. I think for him, to be like Peco is to love and enjoy Ping Pong. Smile probably did enjoy Ping Pong but as he watched Peco's passion for the sport fade way so did his enjoyment along with it.

What I think Smile is playing for and chasing after is that enjoyment for the sport that he used to share with Peco. 




 They're missing out. The attention to detail in terms of background art, hud displays, UI displays, the wear and tear on equipments and suits is superb. The cinematography, editing, music, sound effects, the action and just the overall direction has been excellent and not just for an anime but in general. 




 Eh. You're missing out, I love the murder mystery vibe of Mononoke. 




 This episode was hilarious. I totally did not expect this show to pull off something like this. I'm a bit lukewarm to Akira and Toru but some more comedy would really add some much needed charisma to these characters. 














 The animation in the last scene when Tina, Enju and Kisara were hugging was silky smooth. As opposed to the action scenes which were mainly made up of cut in-cut aways, quick match cuts and close ups in order to hide limited animation.

A cute scene featuring lolisaction scenes. This show knows its priorities. 









 Spoilers, obviously.

 Agreed on Heito and the mad scientist. The whole hysterically evil act is so tired. They really bring down the show, which is unfortunate since the rest of it have improved since episode two.

If you really like the aspect of a supernatural being born out of despair and tragedy then you should really watch the Mononoke tv series (unrelated to the Ghibli movie). 




 [Manga spoiler](/s "Five episodes should be more than enough to cover at least up to chapter 16. Although, I doubt five episodes is enough to resolve that arc. So Season 1 most likely won't have a closure but with good execution it could still feel satisfying albeit with some uncertainty.")

[](/s "I just really hope they don't go the route of using filler episodes and then use Chapter 14 as a cliff hanger ending. The would really suck.")

[](/s "As for the memory loss, yeah that hurt but it was more so frustrating. The relationship between the two was progressing so well despite Hase's wishy-washiness being slightly irritating, then all of sudden we're back to square one. At least Hase seems be showing good growth out of it, with the way he's handling things so far")
 




 Aww! They didn't do Fujiyama's internal monologue during the study scene that was in the manga. I guess it makes sense in terms of pacing the characters, and also consistency since most of the anime is told in Hase's perspective. But still, I really liked that moment. 




 The chemistry between Hinata, Kageyama and Tanaka is great. Their interactions remind me of Ippo, Takmura, Aoki and Kimura. 




 The 256 Gardes dissolve formation sequence looked great. The memorial scene was well shot too. 

[Screenshots](http://imgur.com/a/CSSGs) 




 I think the surprise more has to do with how it was executed. The flash forward was so unexpected that it might have caught people off guard which made the death reveal shocking despite the deathflags.

 Kawaii. 




 Both teams played hard. 




 The drama has somewhat been more nuanced in the last two episodes which is a big improvement but it also made the wacko character types like the Scientist and Heito stick out like a sore thumb. I wish those characters didn't exist, since they're off setting any consistency that could be established.

 I clicked on the link expecting Kondo. Slightly disappointed that it wasn't him. Only slightly because boobs. 




 That was...that was actually kind of good. The episode did a good job of making the characters intriguing, I feel like this is how the show should've started instead of bombarding the audience with too many dramatics. I'm still not getting my hopes up but this will keep me watching. 




 The sweetness of this show is turning me into molasses. 




 That was a nice and laid back team building episode.

I also like that the show rarely resorts to character stills with just moving mouths during dialogues. There's always little body language animation the makes the characters feel alive.  




 I'm curious about how this show will tie everything together. This could end up a disjointed mess or a unique and cleverly told story. Either way this is a type of show that requires patience and the audience to let things unravel instead of expecting the storyline to be laid out in every episode.

Hopefully the saying "The whole is greater than the sum of the parts" rings true for this show.

There's a difference between institutionalized discrimination and personal bigotry. They seemed to be fighting against the latter when the former is far more important. The former could be changed with progressive policies while the latter can't.

Obviously bigotry is not OK but like Mayumi said you can't change what an individual feels by force.  









 I guess those Gardes are worth more than civilian lives and structural damage. As cold as it sounds it kind of makes sense since they're the only line of defense and must be used as a last resort. Even just losing 1/8 of their Gardes would be a huge blow and that's with very little guarantee that the Guana won't get through. So if the option to evade is there then it's probably the best option most of the time.

Still pretty ballsy and quick risk assessment by the Captain.

I didn't expect to experience such an intense space battle so soon after Yamato 2199. What a great surprise.

Also gotta love the detail and design on those graphic displays, UI, and flight instruments. It's the little things that create the space sci-fi atmosphere. 




 The dark tone in this episode is so contrived; the blood licking, the random murderous character, and the mystery mecha inexplicably located in a hospital basement. Still, I'm morbidly curious about this show so I'll keep watching. 




 Don't worry they'll go back to not caring about basketball once they're eliminated. 




 Bullshit double tech. It's just the refs making up for the missed foul on Val. 




 Too many monologues and speeches crammed into one episode which undermined Sugawara's characterization. I feel like that was an excessive amount of set-up just to initiate the chemistry between Kageyama and Hinata. 




 At first I was worried about the jealousy angle but the episode fortunately didn't dwell on it and merely used it as a cause of conflict. And the dialogue was good enough that it came off as a natural reaction from a young man who's in love. Although, I still would've preferred if the show used something less cliche and convenient.

I also really liked how vague they are about the diary during the riverside conversation. It expresses how unsure they are on how to handle the situation but both know how important it is to them. I think that really made the resolution all the more gratifying. 




 The moment the fingers make contact with the eyes it should be called a poke, the ref shouldn't wait for the opponent to get hurt. I mean, they don't ignore a low blow shot even if it didn't affect the fighter, same logic should be applied here. 




 You forgot to add that they're a bunch of screwdrivers playing Monster Hunter. It always amazes how Sorachi comes up with these crazy ideas and make them work. 




 Even one cour shows need 2-3 episodes to set things up. 

I'm finding this "plot development in 3 episodes or bust" mentality among some anime fans to be silly. It's an initial approach that promotes needless impatience and an entitlement for instant gratification. 




 And now we have a big breasted Christmas cake character. This show is just hitting all the otaku-bait staples.

I love the high-brow stuff like Mushishi and Ping Pong and the more subtle drama like One Week Friends but sometimes I just like to sit back and enjoy wacky shows like this one. 




 These muggles are so salty. 




 The pacing seems fine for a 26 episode season. First three episodes set up the characters, magical setting, student council and the awkward take on discrimination. This episode introduced the possible conflict with the anti-magic terrorist group, it's pretty obvious that's where the plot is going. 




 So many good passes are wasted on Asik. 




 DeRozan got the 2006 Finals Wade treatment. 




 This episode gave me a "The Most Dangerous Game" vibe and a little bit of "The Birds" vibe towards the end. Good stuff. 




 CG also allows the animators to have more freedom with the camera work since the camera is operating in 3d. In 2d they redraw all the different angles which is a lot more work. The amount of camera angles, transitions, and different POVs that we saw in this show's action scenes are something you're rarely going to see in 2d animation.

Also I really like the lighting and shadowing in this show, again something hard to pull off in traditional animation.

Hopefully CG in anime keeps improving, variety is a good thing. 




 I actually want to see Kunato try to pilot the Type 17 and possibly make a fool of himself. According to that little bit of exposition the Type 17 demands more from the pilot since the computer system isn't as advanced. 




 The framerate is up and down. 1st episode I thought it was ok, 2nd episode it was really distracting and 3rd episode it's ok-ish. Overall I think the show looks great.

I didn't expect all of them to die. Even though someone dying was predictable I thought it was executed well. The voices of panic and everyone's composure unraveling were pretty convincing. 




 He doesn't have to commit and it might remain that way but I'm just pointing it out that it's a weakness.

Throwing a game is disrespectful to the opponent since it belittles their effort and pride. I highly doubt Kong would appreciate being pitied like that. 




 Tsukimoto's strong sympathy for his opponents is a big weakness but equally so is his view of ping pong as something inconsequential to him. Even if he can become a stonecold player there's really not much that drives him to win, after all this is just a hobby to him. Once he meets his match talentwise he wouldn't have as much resolve as someone who loves the sport, committed to excellence and have a strong will to win.

Weirdly enough Tsukimoto reminds me of Nodame (a pianist) from Nodame Cantabile. Both are talented at their craft but for differing reasons they have trouble committing to it and seeing it as more than a hobby. 




 I really wish this didn't go the amnesia route. We already have a series with the same "mysterious powerful girl" setup that uses amnesia as a plot device.

The interaction between the three is starting to grow on me and inserting some world building gives the show a sense of adventure. 




 Why the fuck is there a case of mass destruction inside a Gastrea?

Also, some of these scenes are put together well with decent enough dialogue but the overacted voice acting spoil these scenes. The screaming and wailing can be a bit grating which is a shame since I like how the show is building up the bond between Rentaro and Enju. 




 Grizz had to beat both the Thunder and Lady Luck 




 Yeah, a bit heavy handed with the character emotions and motives. It's going with the old "angsty MC with a tragic past" concept; nothing wrong with that but the portrayal was way too straightforward and unrefined. Despite all of that, I didn't mind the first episode, it was effective in establishing the dark tone albeit a bit forceful, and it did enough to piqued my interest.

Hopefully the drama doesn't get too overbearing and the show would let it breath. I haven't seen much of Okada's work but she's been criticized for overdone melodrama, so I'm crossing my fingers here. I really really liked Anohana though, melodrama aside. 









 I know anime fans love to complain about MCs in romance shows being wish-washy and beating around the bush but this one is quite the opposite. The relationship feels rushed and unearned, and lacks chemistry. The show hasn't done enough with the dialogue and circumstances to build a feeling of genuine bond between the two. 




 Werdum really turned it on after Browne taunted him. Then Werdum proceeded to taunt Browne for three rounds. 




 Gotta commend Tatsuya for his composure when Miyuki was working her "charms." If I were in his place...ummm I might start questioning my moral values lol.

This has all the makings of a fun guilty pleasure show; overpowered MC, imouto fetishism, nonsense jargon, awkward take on discrimination, and good action. 




 Finally a three. 




 Andersen you idiot. 




 I love Eagle, WTF am I doing watching the ESPN broadcast. 
























 With the exception of the first 2-3 episodes the CG for Space Battleship Yamato 2199 were great. The space battles are amazing. 




 The inconsistent quality of character animation remained distracting though. At first, I thought it was the weird combo of CG and limited animation frame rate but the characters really just had robotic animation. Oh well, sacrifices had to be made to produce those awesome full animated (24 fps) action scenes.

Hopefully Polygon fixed their character animation for Ronia, the Robbers Daughter .

The worst thing about this was those 10 minutes had zero storytelling. 









 We need more Gintama. I miss Kagura. 









 [Zankyou no Terror Episode 11 - Cinematography](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2014/09/zankyou-no-terror-episode-11.html) 




 Such a heartwarming show about friendship, growth and finding a joy in something among friends.

Even though there's an overload of cuteness (which I didn't mind) and a few sappy moments, the show didn't really depend on these to carry the characters and the story. These were just aspects that complemented the core of the show, which is the sincerity of the bond between these characters. 














 Lovely use of [eyeline match](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyeline_match) in this [sequence](http://imgur.com/a/M9S2k). First we see Tanaka looking out the window. The reflection of the crows makes it obvious what's he's looking at. Then it cuts to the crows themselves. Next cut is Daichi looking up at the same crows. A nice flowing continuity from one shot to another that also creates a sense of connection between the two characters.

[Haikyuu!! Episode 25 - Cinematography](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2014/09/haikyuu-episode-25.html) 




 Let's see. Saazbaum attempted to kill the person that Slaine loves the most and started a war that killed millions or maybe billions of people. Then Saazbaum learned that the princess was still alive and made his intention to kill her clear to Slaine. And yet Slaine felt compelled to save him.

There's very little between Slaine and Saazbaum that should outweigh his love for Seylum or simple logic. Yes, Saazbaum spared his life but it wasn't exactly out of mercy or that he valued him as a person. The thought process of, "Hey, I would totally kill you but I owe your father one" isn't exactly a sign of goodwill. If that was enough then Slaine isn't so bright. Well, maybe I'm discounting the effectiveness of Saazbaum's slide show presentation of his feelings. 

As heart-wrenching that episode was the lasting impression is how the clumsy writing made Slaine look like a huge idiot, which really shouldn't be the case.  




 He sure found a balanced diet. 









 [Tokyo Ghoul Episode 12 - Cinematography](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2014/09/tokyo-ghoul-episode-12.html) 




 Probably should've done hair loss treatment and transplant earlier in the balding process like Tom Brady did so it wouldn't have been as noticeable. Well, Brady also had the advantage of wearing a helmet. 




 Haven't seen the show but I approve of using a Soil and Pimp song for the [OP](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQf-NkWz7Yo). We need more Soil and Pimp in anime. 




 The last two episodes adapted the most emotional parts of the manga really well. Dare I say, it did them even better since I didn't get these feel while reading the manga.

People want a second season but this might be one of those rare times that an anime original ending might be preferable. Unless you're in a mood for wishy washy romance melodrama. I certainly was at the time so I still found it entertaining  but there was a definite drop-off in quality. 




 The OVA sold well. I'm hoping that would encourage making another season.  









 I would totally watch an anime about some dude romancing a single mother. 




  This strike anyone else as being... low?  I'm guessing that the majority of the hype was due to Netflix picking it up, which doesn't really affect Japanese sales. Nonetheless, great show.

The manga is not really popular so these sales seem fine. Also the series is only sold as BDs, which is baffling. Not having it available in DVD is money left on the table.  




 The talk with Takeda and the meal were delicately well handled. They were those scenes that let the moment speak for itself and let the audience absorb what's happening.

edit: [Haikyuu!! Episode 24 - Cinematography](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2014/09/haikyuu-episode-24.html) 









 I love how moody the intro was. Kind of wish that the episode maintained that.

I think the storyboarding carried that scene. The insert shots of the glasses were timed so well with the dialogue.

 That "Queen" Revy. Damn. 




 To be fair, I think fitting large amount of exposition into the story is easier done in books than a visual medium. 









 Maybe he has a doting younger sister holding back his power. 




 This show actually handles escalation quite well. Despite Tatsuya being OP as hell his feats remain exciting because they don't get flaunted that often until the right moments.

Shameless plug: [Anime Cinematography](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/) 




 Your complaint has been less and less of a problem lately, at least with the shows that I've been watching. Take Akame ga Kill for example. It's a rather low budget looking show but the dialogues are handled competently.

Let's use this scene as an example: http://a.pomf.se/olnybc.webm

Shot by shot breakdown

Establishing shot  a wide shot that gives a sense of time and place. The two characters are at a dinner table and its late afternoon (sunset colored sunlight)

Medium close-up of prime minister

High angle shot behind the prime minister with the camera tilting  yes this fits your complaint about characters talking while facing away from the camera but this actually serves a purpose. The camera tilting to the prince is a visual of the dialogue flow with him at the receiving end.

Medium close-up of the prince (continuity from the tilt shot)

Medium shot of prime minister (shot reverse shot). Prince holds up a paper and PM looks at it.

Cut to an eyeline match of what the PM is looking at, which is the paper with a list on it (again this is continuity from the last shot).

Close up of PM (with some badly done shallow focus) and then prince (shot reverse shot). The close ups give a better sense of their predicament.

Re-establishing shot, slow zoom out and fade out to black.

The cinematography wasn't elaborate. It wasn't compositionally heavy, although the arc in the background was used as a framing element and the ray of light as leading lines. But, IMO it wasn't stale shot making and had a decent grasp of visual continuity.
 




 Rafael asks: 

In film, the camera is one of the most basic yet powerful tools of expression in a filmmaker's arsenal. As you are a film scholar, I'm sure you already know the power of a well-composed shot. My question is this: Anime relies a lot on static shots, largely for budgetary reasons (moving backgrounds, characters on a rotating dolly shot, etc. are hard to animate as perspective changes). There's not a lot of tracking/dolly/crane/steadicam shots in anime. Knowing how much the movement of the shot (or lack thereof) influences how the audience views a scene emotionally, how do you think has anime's reliance on static shots influenced its cinematic language? Do you think they've explored techniques in the static shot enough so that they don't have to rely so much on tracking shots to communicate the same emotions? I'm aware that there are numerous other things that affect the shot composition, but I wanted to ask about static shots specifically. 

**Moving the camera is actually something that didn't pop up much in motion picture history until relatively late. Early silent film cameras were bulky and heavy, and moving them was just too difficult. (You may have seen footage of a giant merry-go-round built for doing chase scenes in the silent era. The merry-go-round was for the actors and set, while the camera stayed on the ground.) This started to become less of a problem towards the end of the silent era, but then when talkies came the additional burden of the sound equipment and having to stay absolutely silent during shooting put a damper on adventurous camera technique. It took a long time for cinema to recover from the stiffness introduced by microphones. While cameras might have been able to shift around in place on a tripod, actually moving the camera, and the devices with which that could be done smoothly like dollies or jibs (mini-cranes for cameras) were things that had to be invented after that point, starting in the late 1930s. Hand-holding the camera was often too shaky until the Steadicam was invented, and that didn't become commonplace until the late 1980s.**

**Animation had similar limitations in that you could always move the camera, but doing so was a lot more trouble than it was usually worth. The low-budget nature of anime also meant that new inventions that made such things easier were slow in coming to Japan. Multi-plane animation techniques pioneered by Disney in the 30s and 40s (which you see as different layers of backgrounds panning across the screen at different speeds) didn't get used much in anime until the 1970s. And Japan pretty much skipped the early computer-aided drafting era of animation in the late 80s, not integrating computers into their workflows until early 2000s. So, for a very, very, very long time -- until the last decade, really -- anime creators were pretty much stuck with only the camera techniques they could draw by hand.** 

**Luckily, this worked quite well when combined with Japanese filmmaking, which leans heavily on the Yasujiro Ozu school of long, still shots, with cuts to close-ups for dramatic effect, and cuts to random little asides (a piece of litter, a glass of water -- Ozu called these "pillow shots") as a rhythmic pause, as if the life of a scene is taking a breath. The technical limitations of anime and that style of filmmaking work very well together, which is probably why the art form is so heavily influenced by it, whereas Japanese live action filmmaking has long since moved on.** 

**I think the economy with which the camera moves in anime tends to inherently give those shots more importance. A moving point of view shot happens so seldom, and the craft in which things move is so labored and clearly difficult, that it can't help but make an impression. It's similar to how body language is portrayed in anime: every twitch of a finger, every eye movement was a deliberate choice by the animators, and is important; it's never because an actor had a fly land on them or has an itch. That extra motion doesn't happen very often, so when it does, we take notice, and try to observe why it's happening. It adds meaning to a scene.** 

**There are still moving camera shots that take my breath away: hand drawn ones like the subway shoot-out in Kite, or the opening shot in The Heroic Legend of Arslan. There are moving camera shots that make me chuckle because they couldn't quite pull it off, like an early scene in Black Magic M-66 where the camera chases two people running through the woods, and the perspective of all of the passing trees gets completely screwed up. Even Paprika, which was an all-digital work, made innovative use of changing perspective in several shots, to breathtaking effect.** 

**Lately, I think some of the best, most pioneering work in terms of changing-perspective animation can be found in some of the insanely intricate swimming scenes in the current season of Free! That show is visually mind-blowing, even if all of the exposed flesh in that show does nothing for you.**

 [Shiki vs Lio alley fight](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VPDTQViU3c), I thought was the best fight scene of the series and maybe one the best in anime. I actually liked the first half of that movie, too bad the second half took a nose dive. 









 I'm glad Naru's fall wasn't made into a big drama and was appropriately used to strengthened the bond between the four and as a feel good moment.

[Sally-sensei's Yosakoi](http://gfycat.com/DescriptiveDelectableBluebottlejellyfish) 




 Samurai Flamenco 




 A writer/director can come up with a safest premise that's moe-centric and panders to the otaku and still not get funding for a $500k 24 minute OVA. Let's get real, that's too expensive and not a sound investment. 




 [Mushishi Zoku Shou Special - Cinematography](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2014/08/mushishi-episode-11-and-12.html) 




 The reactions to Kageyama being complimentary were funny. Chemistry between the characters is the best aspect of this show.

That Oikawa flashback was awkwardly inserted. Probably would've worked if done in between sets or during a timeout. 




 I'm not even sure if they're actually adoptive siblings, or Akari just started calling him Onii-Sama because they're close childhood friends. 














 I think she's an amusing one note character. She fits the guilty pleasure vibe of the series. 




 Kind of disappointing the it's not his. I was ready to add AI and Robotics Expert to his resume. 




 http://i.imgur.com/PDdW9jZ.gif 




 Don't deny it. Just accept the power of the lewd. 




 She ain't dead. That ship would be totally useless without her. Unless they turn her dead body into Aldnoah fuel. 

I feel that some of the story details in this episode like Marito's past and the state of Martian politics and society should have been revealed earlier and would've gave the story/characters a stronger foundation.  




 I've been watching some older anime lately, like Future Boy Conan, Maison Ikkoku, Utena and Touch. The voice acting were fine but they weren't some revelation exposing me to the wonders of pre-2000's voice work.

I do understand the complaints about high pitched voices but when shows have teenage girls being voiced by full grown women then of course it would sound unnatural as they try to adjust their voice to match a younger age.

[First 10 minutes of Tomino's new show, Gundam Reconguista in G](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IN3KN5Xlo8U). Again, the voice work is fine but nothing special. On the other hand, that Yugo Kanno OST is sounding amazing. 




 Kokutou just loves crazy. 




 Gainax animation at its peak was that epic Asuka fight scene and the The Wings of Honnamise rocket launch. 




 Another LOGH thread made the front page of /r/all a few days ago. Hopefully that got more people watching. 




 I need to catch up on some western shows anyway. 









 Eh, they just don't want to admit that they messed up on Hosada. 




 The show is hit or miss but some of the hits are really good.

This episode (S2 episode 8) isn't guitar themed but the soundtrack for it is great. Great episode by the way, even if you end up not liking the story (I didn't like it that much either), everything else was exceptional (cinematography, animation, art, etc.) and a delight to watch.

I would also recommend S2 episode 5. Probably the best episode of the series. 









 It was predictable that something bad would happen, but with characters so likable and so easy to root for the expected mishap still leaves an effect.

Sally-sensei might save the day in the next episode and perhaps change Machi's view of her.

Stay strong Naru. The Princess, The Tsundere and The Blond got your back. 




 [The entire Legend of the Galactic Heroes series](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CNBZj36pbc index=1 list=PLNyY2F1OurUbDBCtILijHYI52YAiIvSX5) for anyone that's interested. 









 [Space Dandy S2 Episode 8 - Cinematography](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2014/08/space-dandy-s2-episode-8.html). 









 Bob cut looks great on Senjougahara and Tsukihi. The rest look better with long hair. 




 The show's animation, character and ship designs can use a remake. The first season's character design had some mannish looking women. 




 I'm no chemist but the potassium chlorate can act as an oxidizer for the initial ignition. The oxygen in the air maintains it. Whether that initial ignition is enough to start a reaction in a Hydrogen filled atmosphere might be the question.

The head of "strike anywhere" matches contain an oxidizing agent such as potassium chlorate together with tetraphosphorus trisulfide, P4S3, glass and binder.  The phosphorus sulfide is easily ignited, the potassium chlorate decomposes to give oxygen, which in turn causes the phosphorus sulfide to burn more vigorously.


The head of safety matches are made of an oxidizing agent such as potassium chlorate, mixed with sulfur, fillers and glass powder.  The side of the box contains red phosphorus, binder and powdered glass.  The heat generated by friction when the match is struck causes a minute amount of red phosphorus to be converted to white phosphorus, which ingnites spontaneously in air.  This sets off the decomposition of potassium chlorate to give oxygen and potassium chloride.  The sulfur catches fire and ignites the wood.

http://depts.washington.edu/chem/facilserv/lecturedemo/MatchHeadReaction-UWDept.ofChemistry.html 




 This show just has a way of highlighting characters in a very gratifying way. 

Sugawara is definitely better at being a glue for the team and seeing the bigger picture but Kageyama gives them intensity and edge. Kageyama can get overwhelmed mentally while with Sugawara it's physically/athletically. I like how the show presented these differences. 




 I miss Senjougahara. This arc kept dropping her name too, tease. 




 The feels are coming? While I've really enjoyed this show, the emotional and thematic parts weren't very engaging despite being presented well. I think if the show decides to dig a bit deeper it could turn from being a good show to a great one.

  Ahahaha. Using Aldnoah Zero next to M3 as something 'bad' and showing A1-pictures titles and saying only SAO can bring in money (well it does bring in more money atleast).

It really wouldn't be that surprising if Aldonoah and Persona made A-1 money. 

Also Space Brothers and Fairy Tale are daytime anime and mostly dependent on TV ratings rather than BD/DVD sales. Considering they are/were long running shows I'm pretty sure they made A-1 money.

  Psycho-Pass has some really good songs.

[Yugo Kanno](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugo_Kanno) needs more love. His OST for Birdy the Mighty is also excellent. 




 I'm hoping for a Lu Gonghu vs Tatsuya showdown. 




 Finally, Asseylum does something. 

Inaho wants that Aldnoah tech that Asseylum can provide and he doesn't want to risk having Slaine get in the way of things. Although, getting that tech comes at the price of prolonging the war and more casualties but Inaho would probably see it as strategically justifiable for the sake of reaching parity with the Martians. I think Inaho will be entering Machiavellian mode.

Of course there's also Asseylum's view on things to be taken into account. The show is starting to get more interesting with all these significant factors coming into play. I hope its handled well and avoids over-simplification or being convoluted. 




 The show was Gundam-esque from the very beginning. 




 You should watch Space Battleship Yamato 2199 for the quintessential battleship badassery.  




  The only thing that I am 100% sure about is that the Martian rebel girl will try to kill the princess after she has outlasted her usefulness. She seems to have a bigger grudge than most of the Terrans and I don't blame her for that.

It's hard to sympathize with her since her father was part of a group that started this whole damn mess that killed millions of people.

 Also, people need to keep in mind that talent development is a fickle thing and having a stacked farm system doesn't guarantee long term success.

2006 D-backs farm system is probably more stacked than this Cubs farm system and only made it to the playoffs twice since then. That prospect class included Justin Upton, Stephen Drew, Conor Jackson, Carlos Quentin, Chris Young and Carlos Gonzalez. Although, Quentin and CarGo were used as trade pieces.

On a more positive side, for the past two seasons the hyped 2010 Royals farm system has been coming to fruition. Although Hosmer and Moustakas have been disappointing.

 Nothing confirmed but so far the first volume have sold almost 30,000 BD/DVDs. Also the anime boosted manga sales. So unless the show's production committee hates money, it will most likely get a second season.

 He's also soon to be a Gravity-type Magic Thermonuclear Fusion Expert.

 Marito needs to get his shit together. That Thousand-yard stare act is getting old. He's starting to resemble Tayback from Tropic Thunder. Asseylum continues to sit on her hands and the show's excuses for it have been fairly poor. I think these two are the most frustrating parts of the show. 

We need more dead pan deliveries from Inaho. That would justify his total lack of emotion. He's also reaching Tatsuya level of tactical omniscience.

 Eh. Depends on what people are looking for. If they want a serious take on romance and relationships then this ain't it. If they just want a typical soapy drama to enjoy then I think the manga delivers. 




 Naru reminded me a bit of Akari (Aria) with those sentimental remarks. 









 The Tale of Princess Kaguya and When Marnie Was There being big flops really hurt the studio. I guess films without Hayao Miyazaki's name attached to it are hard sells. If From Up on Poppy Hill and Arrietty didn't list him as a writer they probably wouldn't have made as much money, the former likely being a flop.

 




 Space Battleship Yamato 2199 




 [I respectfully disagree](http://gfycat.com/ConcernedWaryCurassow). 




 Tatsuya the Magical Terminator. I enjoy how his over-poweredness keeps escalating. Such a great guilty pleasure. 




 I think the show could do a better job of presenting the actual dangers that comes with Asseylum revealing herself. As of now it just feels like she's being complacent and her indecisiveness comes across as a plot device, a contrived reason for the ongoing conflict. 

I don't mind exposition since that Mech exploding in the ocean with little explanation would've been a WTF moment but there has to be a better way to do them. These mid-fight and post-fight expositions feel like lectures.

 Good episode with the exception of some awkward exposition towards the end. The enemy mech needing to have openings to receive signals and to walk could've been mentioned during prep time. That would've been enough to make the water strategy to be self explanatory.

I'm also curious about the mechanics of that energy field. The show just can't ignore the law of conservation of mass and energy.

 [Zankyou no Terror Episode 2 - Cinematography](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2014/07/zankyou-no-terror-episode-2.html) 




 I love how the show made fun of itself when Hinata started doing the typical sports shonen hype speech at some random guy.

While the build up was amusing and hyped up the match I thought it took too long. Last episode was basically a build up episode, dedicating another 18 minutes to it seemed rather excessive.

 I liked what was done with Leon's character. A tragic outcome for a person consumed by anger and revenge. But I hated the super vanilla end fight. The super perfect golden haired prince who had about the perfect childhood ends up saving the day (rolls eyes). I get there's supposed to be a parallel but it doesn't have to be so black and white that one character gets put on a mountain sized pedestal. 




 I hope it goes more into world building. The sense of adventure and camaraderie is already there, it just needs that little bit of world detail.

 "It's all the same whether you're here or not"

The call back to that line at the end and the delivery of "I'll be here with you" were perfect and painful.

I'm with everyone here, Tsubaki needs to confess at this point. The emotional build up is at its crescendo and it would be a shame if it gets dragged out.

 That fight scene between Saber and Kuzuki was actually kind of disappointing. Lots of single character shots and insert shots instead of showing a two person fight choreography. 




 But in this fight scene it was Kuzuki rushing forward when Shirou all of a sudden turns into a master swordsman. I'm gonna call a spade a spade here, it's an action shounen style in the nick of time power up. 









 [Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso Episode 10 - Cinematography](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2014/12/shigatsu-wa-kimi-no-uso-your-lie-in.html) 




 Exactly, there's nothing inherently bad with tropes it's how you use them. Storytelling has been around for a long long time, there's a trope for everything. Saying a story or character is bad because they fit a trope is lazy criticism since any character and story, if you simplify them enough can be distilled to a certain trope.  




 Yeah, people love to blame the studio when things don't go right but I think a lot of the time they're just hired to animate and the production committee that's paying them have the final say on things. This is also the reason why low sales doesn't always mean the studio lost money. They're paid to animate and they're not investing their own money. Low risk work in exchange for not having full creative control.
 




 A friend in denial of his or her feelings is a common romance convention but this manga just does it right. It's the little things, like the piggy back ride, the beach footprints, and the popsicle flavors that make it feel sincere. Reminds me a bit of how Cross Game made me feel, although Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso is a lot less subtle.  




 This part was adapted so well. Really did well in expressing the bond between Ki-ja and the villagers. This was also the part of the manga when the humor started  to come to its own and the episode pulled it off.

[I really like the ED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgvc0Teh3B8) 




 Deen also produced, Urusei Yatsura, Angel's Egg, Maison Ikkoku, Patlabor, Ranma , and Patlabor: The Movie. Most of them are considered to be old school classics.

I also wasn't aware that Deen did Maria-sama ga Miteru series. Very pretty anime.

It's very unfortunate that recency bias and the circle jerk mentality lead to lack of appreciation of a studio's older works and contribution to anime. The saddest example of this is Toei. 














 lol Birk got onii-sama'd. I want the Borkas to be more involved in the story.  




 Wow, not a single mentioned of Mamoru Oshii (Ghost in a Shell, Patlabor OVA, Patlabor 1 2, Angel's Egg) and Isao Takahata (Grave of the Fireflies, Only Yesterday, The Tale of Princess Kaguya). Well at least someone mentioned Takahiro Omori, who's so ridiculously under appreciated.

Out of the big name directors Oshii has the most distinct style. He plays with rhythm a lot, both with editing and visuals. His shot length tend to be longer, which produces a slower, more meticulous and contemplative rhythm than most anime. A style that really fits the content of his movies, which mostly deal with thought provoking themes.

Takahata is the mature side of Ghibli. His characters are more complex and nuanced than Miyazaki's. This is very much evident when the character drama in The Tale of Princess Kaguya is compared to The Wind Rises. Kaguya just offered a more compelling character with a more realized internal struggle. 




 That's what alcohol is for. 




 The childhood flashbacks in this movie were way too relatable. They were effective at making one harken back to childhood memories, both the good and the bad. 




 I'm usually not a fan of bringing a character back to life whether it's an actual revival or a fake death but this is one of the few exceptions.

Shirasu's betrayal was rage inducing but also sad at the same time. 




 Considering how wacky some anime endings can be at times, I wouldn't be surprised if some directors did come up with the ending through stream of thought brainstorming. 




 The extended Emi flashback definitely could've been included in the last episode but even if that was done Kousei's performance wouldn't have fit into one episode. In the manga the performance is a little but more than three chapters long. Emi's flashback was extended to make the cutoff of Kousei's performance less awkward.

The show has been a very faithful adaptation of the manga, so the flashbacks were suppose to be there. The performances would've been emotionally empty without the flashbacks. You can argue about their placement and perhaps the story should've began from the very beginning but altering the story structure so much is something the manga author might not agree with. 




 I hate Alan Anderson. 









 New weapon looked awesome. 




 Mushishi does more with storytelling and human drama in one episode than most anime can ever do in one season. 




 Missing Legend of the Galactic Heroes. This is like making a list of serious TV dramas and leaving out The Wire. 




 [Hak's fortune cookie.](http://i.imgur.com/SR0gssC.jpg) 




 Using Kousei's internal monologue to present the parallel between Kaori and his mother was really heart-wrenching.

Tsubaki's friend dropping some truth bombs. To be fair to Tsuabaki, seeing Kousei be so smitten by Kaori is very discouraging. 




 Ok, this post explains your complaint better.

My point of contention with your initial post is that it's such a simplification that it can be applied to a lot of shows. It's just a dramatic device, how it's used determines if the characters and story turn out well or not.

Ping Pong is multitudes better than this show but uses the same dramatic device. The obvious difference maker being Ping Pong has much better execution and justification for using it. 




 So basically like a lot of anime drama or drama in general.

Although it's a bit more frustrating here because Shione is double dipping in this dramatic device. 














 The snowy scenery looked so good.

 That kid merged with the mushi before he was even born. He was eventually going to be part of that mushi's life cycle whether Ginko did anything or not.

 Shhh...there's no room for logic when it comes to anti-Toei circle jerk. It's also sad that people use this to dismiss the studio. A studio that's been around since the 1960's and have contributed so much to anime. 




 Some people just keep to themselves even from people that are close to them. He wasn't that open of a person to begin with. After becoming a host to an alien parasite and then basically merging with it, it actually makes sense he would be more secretive and closed off.

Also, hearing about how his mom died, seeing what she became and then seeing her die again as a parasite would make it really hard to lie about her death. Lying about it is almost like trivializing the whole ordeal.

Also Knights of Sidonia had it's "sakuga" moments:

 Hmm...I guess the point of this episode is to show that the Mattis can do just fine without robbing people. From what I've read from the wiki, showing this is also a set-up for later developments. I think the episode could've been firmer in conveying these things.

[Loved the animation here](http://gfycat.com/PowerlessGaseousBernesemountaindog). 




 I really like how the girl never really felt alone despite being visually presented that way. Would've been easy to portray her as isolated and lonely but instead the episode focused on how the love of her mother and sister kept her from feeling that way.

 Really hoping Polygon's vastly improved animation in Ronia the Robber's Daughter shows up in the newer Sidonia seasons. Of course just like traditional animation budget is a factor. 




 The last two chapters had me welling up while reading them.

We finally get the whole story why Kousei's mother was so forceful. She was desperate to ensure his future with the only way she knows how, which is through music, and in a short amount of time. Not that it made her actions justifiable but it provided a reasoning and we come to understand her more as a character instead of things being painted as black and white. 









 Ronja is the cutest tsundere.

This episode taking a turn for the eerie side and doing it well was unexpected. That emotional scene was very convincing too. 




 Again that felt too easy and unearned for Kyoya. Just like the necklace gift, him finally expressing his feelings to her did very little in addressing the problems between the two. There's no actual reconciliation going on, no show of remorse and very little understanding between the two.

 [This scene was great.](http://youtu.be/JDdG1C6ydOk)

The tracking shot follows Kousei and slowly reveals Kaori. As Kaori comes more into view in the frame, Kousei spots her and comically hides from her. It then switches to Kousei's POV, which puts the audience in his shoes and makes it easy to root for the guy. The insert shot of the sandwich (suggesting he wants to give it to her) shows him finally mustering up some courage, then only to be thwarted by Watari.

 I thought Mohawk guy's incompetent communication skills exacerbating the situation was funny. Just watching things progressively get worse as he kept on putting his foot in his mouth was really amusing. Miyamori being the final piece to his domino effect of fuck-ups was a great way to top it off. I can't hate on Mohawk guy, his antics made for some good situational comedy.

I really like that the show presented a reasonable voice to discuss the situation between CG vs traditional animation. The notion that CG and traditional animation can work together and animators from both sides can learn from each other reflects the collaboration between Ghibli and Polygon. I think those two studios working together is a great learning experience for both.

 I'm guessing the last two characters that have been introduced are going to be reoccurring ones. Should be a fun dynamic. 




 Another amazing episode. This last cour is shaping up to be the best of the series. This anime is unparalleled in terms of intertwining human drama and speculative fiction elements. The only ones that come close are Natsume and Mononoke. 

My only criticism of the series is it relies too much on flashbacks to set up the story and characters. It can feel a bit formulaic at times, but the stories are so good that I barely even mind it.

 Shirou might be significantly less annoying this time.

Mitsuzuri looks so much like Shiki. 




 Either this or waiting for the manga to end so I can pick it back up and marathon it. 




 Welp. Thanks for the correction. At least it might have lead people to watching Mushishi. 




 Really liked the [shots of the eyes](http://i.imgur.com/z9Fm5ZI.jpg) in this episode.

 With regards to G-Reco, I thought it was amusing when in some scenes Tomino basically abandoned editing and resorted to gratuitous zooming and panning. 




 This is based on people that have Torne TV tuner/DVR for the PlayStation 3, 4 and Vita. Well, that's a very limited reach.

 Knights of Sidonia had a decent following and that was CG. Ronja's CG is much better than KoS.

I think the lack of following more has to do with this being a children's show. 




 Yes. People finally get to experience the screw driver arc. I always wonder how Sorachi comes up with these crazy ideas. 




 I think Ronja took his parents' words about being brave too much to heart lol. She's taunting harpies and trying to jump Hell's Gap.

Admittedly, this is moving a bit slow but I think her encounter with that boy should move things along a bit quicker.

 I thought it was fine. Her character struggles are finally being established. I believe the show got criticized about it when it glossed over it in the last arc of the first season. It would be kind of silly to begin establishing her struggles and have her progress from it, all in one episode.

Low self-esteem issues aren't exactly easily fixed.

You're also overly simplifying her situation. She's clearly self conscious about her physical appearance and there's a sense of isolation. That probably has a lot to do with why she wants to get stronger and take part in a raid.

 Three episodes covered 5 chapters. The first chapter is a long one so it really equates to 6 chapters. This season is scheduled for 24 episodes, so that would be around 50 chapters. At least I'm hoping that would be the pace, instead of 70+ chapters being compressed in 2 cours.

Anyway, I ended up marathoning up to chapter 18. Just couldn't help myself, but that was a good stopping point and satiated my curiosity. The most surprising part was the humor. I hope that translates well to the anime. 




 Well, they just haven't been caught yet. 




 This chapter hit a lot harder emotionally than the others. I think it's because it provided a clearer picture of how hard it is to remember a loved one who drastically changed towards the end of their life.

This made me listen to Hospice by The Antlers. Now I'm depressed. 




 Just google Anime-koi. The website should be the first result and you'll find the torrent there. 




 Fansubbed by Anime-koi 




 The characters are cel-shaded cg. It's animated at 12 fps, similar to most traditionally animated shows. It's the little subtle movements that make the animation stand out. 




 The characters feel alive. There's constant facial expressions (eyes, eye brows, mouth) and body language during dialogues. The mouth is animated to match how they speak (like Akira) so there's little flapping mouth effect unlike in most anime. The mouth movements weren't always perfect but I thought they looked good for the most part.

The shadows are dynamic. If you watch the facial animation video again, you'll notice the character's flapping tunic casts a shadow that moves along with it.

For more dynamic movements, I think the videos I posted are representative of the show.

As for negatives, I wish this was fully animated at 24 fps especially since the overall animation is really well done. After years of watching limited animation, I'm used to 12 fps but I hope CG anime would eventually progress to 24 fps. The 24 fps portion of Knights of Sidonia looked really good.

I also wish Ronja's running animation had more variety, she runs a bit too perfectly like a track athlete.

 This episode exuded a great sense of adventure and wide eyed wonder. It was hard not to smile seeing Ronja running through the forest while giggling with excitement.

The grey dwarves were effectively creepy just like the harpies.

Also the sound design in this show is amazing. The sound of the wind, the flowing water, the insects and birds really brought the forest to life.

I think people are really missing out here. This might actually have better production value than Fate/stay night and Shingeki no Bahamut. The background work, camera work, sound design, the facial animation, character animation and the overall atmosphere all have been great so far. 




 I love how a couple of the earlier episodes somehow connects to this one. The darkness reminded me a bit of the Path of Thorns special and the Cloudless Rain episode also relates.

 The last few chapters have been feeling rather ominous regarding Kaori. This manga is gonna break me, aint it? 




 Also, notice that the mouth is animated to match the way the characters speak. It wasn't always on point but I think it looked good for the most of the 2-episode premiere and definitely better than the flapping mouth effect we see in most anime.

 Most of the show were done on two's but there were a good amount of well animated sequences, just not as smooth as the clip above.

I thought Space Dandy was inconsistent but it was an experimental show that worked with unique concepts. It was a type of risk taking we rarely see in anime, I think it's worth checking out just for that. 




 (although most shows are in the 20fps category nowadays)

Nope. Anime is still mostly done on two's.

This small clip from Space Dandy is what animation done on one's looks like: https://mediacru.sh/RoqPZSo9xRBV

I would say most shows aren't close to looking that smooth in a consistent basis.

 




 **The motion they used didn't even call for it really**. Unless they used the model elsewhere, they would've been better off making it using traditional animation all the way through.

There's a reason why most camera movements in z-axis are done in CG and that's because it would be more difficult and time consuming with traditional animation while yielding marginally better/worse results. If that part of the scene was done traditionally the animator would have to painstakingly redraw the cobblestones to account for perspective changes. This is time better spent on character animation. Using CG was just the most efficient option while still yielding the desired results. 









 Nice CG during the Moonlight Sonata solo, well animated and barely noticeable. The characters have nice chemistry right off the bat but I'm really hoping it doesn't turn into a love triangle drama...I need a break from that. 




 I like her as a foil to Akane and as someone who might challenge her ideals. There's also gotta be a reason why she hates latent criminals, which could make for a nice back story. 




 On another note, the frame rate in Pixar movies (or in anime, actually, **since most anime is also done at 24fps**) likely isn't really an issue because there are certain things animators do (and specifically avoid doing) to make animation smoother at a lower frame rate. The choppiness you see in CGI is likely because the computer is purely mathematical -- it doesn't really think "Hm, this needs corrected slightly," like a good animator will.

No on the bolded part. Yes there's 24 frames in each second but with most anime only 12 out of 24 are unique frames and the rest are repetition. It's animation done on "2's." With cheaper anime it's done on "3's." This is aptly called Limited Animation.

Pixar movies are fully animated, meaning 24 unique frames per second or done on "1's" 




 CGI looks very choppy unless it's 60FPS

You find Pixar movies choppy? Those are animated at 24 fps. 




 This post updated some of the totals.

http://www.someanithing.com/2239 




 The manga seems to be regarded well. So, I checked out the first chapter and the anime is pretty faithful so far. Although trying to fit 29 chapters into 12 episodes might be problematic. 














 Oh wow, that was surprisingly really good. The animation, the art, the direction, the ost, and the voice acting were all on point. Most importantly it was a really fun watch.

This show has that pulp fantasy feel to it. 









 Omori will be busy with this for a while, which ruins my hope that he might be working on the new Natsume sometime soon. 




 This was like reliving the mess that was Captain Earth. A bunch of jargon and stuff happening with very little in a way of narrative to make sense of them.

I wish the music wasn't so muted because that Yugo Kanno soundtrack is great. Although, the orchestral music sometimes doesn't fit the vibe of the show.  




 Then how can you stand anime which is mostly animated at 12 fps or less. Hell, sometimes it's not even animated and we just get a bunch of stills, characters just flapping their mouths with zero body movement or characters sliding across the screen. 
























 I wonder if Galfa would go through with it. He's been turning to a pretty despicable human being so far. I called him a douchebag a few weeks ago and got downvoted. I don't think that assessment has been far off. 




 Not here but in Japan it's getting good TV ratings. 




 Anime in general tend to be prudish about sex, it's not just isolated to female characters. The commenter also seems to heavily conflate sexual expressiveness with intellectual competency, as if one cannot occur without the other.

While most female leads aren't sexually expressive I think it's uncommon in modern anime that they're depicted as inferior and woefully incompetent compared to male counterparts. Of course the commenter will just dismiss that notion with a comment like this:

Obviously I'm painting very broad strokes, and no anime-watchers will struggle to produce counterexamples. Nevertheless, I think if they're honest with themselves, they'll see that anime generally sexualizes women by showing their virginal charm. Rarely is the female lead of anime world-wise or sexually-liberated. Westerners would accept that much more readily. But unfortunately, dojikko and emotionally stunted *-deres are 300x more common. 



















 Chlo Grace Moretz voice acting was underwhelming but the rest of cast were good, especially the parents. 




 Ema's story felt a bit rushed. I think this could have been better as a two episode arc. If the show is really going the Leon x Ema route, then two episodes would've been better for establishing that.

I wouldn't mind a Leon and Ema romance. Age difference don't bother me. It does feel a bit too immediate after Lara's death.

 




 The scenery shots in the last two episodes have been ace.

 I also prefer my suffering in bulk. 




 The way the manga showed she was dying was so sudden that it took a while to process. It also took a while for Kousei to process what happened. The cat scene was both allegorical and reality slowly sinking in. I think it was perceptive of the author to let the readers go through similar emotions right along with Kousei. 









 Heh. I find it ironic that Slaine was afraid that Inaho was exploiting Asseylum when he's actually doing that now by having someone impersonate her so he can make his power plays.

 A short post on [Garo Episode 18's Cinematography](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2015/02/garo-honoo-no-kokuin-episode-18.html). 




  I feel spoiled now. Even now when I see other shows and they're characters aren't like Yona I get a little disappointed.

I really recommend The Twelve Kingdoms if you want female characters with strong character development. Also Beast Player Erin. 




 I felt bad for Yona when she couldn't answer the question about what she can bring to the table. Perhaps in the next few episodes she can finally put her archery practice to use and also grow as a leader. 




 The love triangle drama coming to a head right now feels kind of odd. At this point I feel like the focus should be Kousei's competition, Kaori's condition and their desire to play together again. But then again I also thought Nagi's appearance was also odd and that worked out really well. 




 To be fair to Kousei, the mixed signals Kaori are sending must be confusing him. He's even going to be more confused now that Tsubaki has confessed haha.

I got a feeling that Watari is going to see through Kaori, be a bro and bat for Kousei. 

 









 Hopefully they fermented that mare's milk. Apparently unfermented mare's milk is a strong laxative.

[Supposedly it tastes really sour and smokey.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z35e-_YEzfA)

Also I wouldn't have minded eating salmon for three days. 




 Galfa is kind of a douchebag. Wouldn't have minded if he actually got killed. 




 I dunno man. The pitchforks are out and redditors are demanding an apology, Plumlee must have inflicted some serious emotional trauma on these people. 




 I get my existentialism from Gintama

Whether its the dent below your nose or the built-in microphone on the Famicoms second player controller, there are many things in this world that make no sense. However, humans are meant to eat, poop, and sleep. Everything else we do is useless. Our creations(Patriot) fall into that category. 




 That town is like a Costco where they force feed you samples.

The show has been entertaining so far with a pretty unique world building but the narrative for these small story arcs could be a bit tighter. The show gets the gist of it across but not the finer details. 




 I used to be really into kickboxing during the glory days of K-1. Also, from time to time I would look up fight videos of the top ranked Lumpinee and Rajadamnern fighters.

In general, my interest in fight sports (including MMA and boxing) just faded. I just pay attention to the bigger fights and up and coming talent with some hype behind them. 




 I like the pacing. It feels like the calm before the storm. This series has always been about the slow build up anyway. Each arc takes it time to present the details about the world and the development of the characters, which then culminate to a gratifying climax and resolution. 




 Why must Leon suffer so much!

I wouldn't mind a revival as long as it's handled well but I'm not sure if I really want it. That death scene was one of those exceptionally executed scenes that leaves a lasting imprint but a revival might weaken that effect. 




 Maybe "FLAG". I can't find a video showing the controls but I remember them being sensible. 




  I'd think it's pretty fair to claim that HxH is one of the greatest anime of all-time

And not everyone shares that opinion as evident by a couple of top 25's. I think that's fine, it would be rather boring if everyone likes the same things. As they say, variety is the spice of life. 




 I always find it endearingly peculiar that the ANN top 25 has three Maria-sama ga Miteru seasons. By the way, it's a very pleasant series.

[All the seasons are on youtube](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4U0FQ15BX8D1-lCVHli3WNK7KhVOuBtH) 




 I've been trying to spread the brilliance of Koji Yamamura but with almost zero success lol. 









 Cross Game and Aria. 




 Yun was right, the gang does keep getting weirder. Really curious how Yona is going to convince the Green Dragon to team up with them. Maybe it will be Hak who's going to do the convincing.

Not even an ounce of jealousy from Yona. Hak has his work cut out for him.

Also if you want another fantasy show with a badass redheaded female MC, I really recommend **The Twelve Kingdoms**. It's a slower show and far more serious and darker. The character development is some the most gratifying in anime and the world building is detailed and expansive.

[Just look at this graceful badass](http://i.imgur.com/gwJjSRJ.jpg) 




 Tropes aren't inherently bad...really there's a trope for everything since storytelling have been in existence for thousands of years. Tropes are tools, it's how they're used that determines whether the story and/or character appeals to the audience or not.

An obvious ending is not bad either. To me the journey is far more important than the destination.

 I just now realized the gray dwarves look like creepy penguins.

The dream scene was great. Really liked the use of color to accompany the changes in emotions. The quivering eyebrows were also a nice touch when Ronja was tearing up. Good stuff by Goro.

 It's not a question of ability but health. 




 The non-Leon episodes are somewhat entertaining but nowhere near as interesting.

 But generalizations are fun and get easy upvotes. Funnily enough this is also guilty of pandering that it's criticizing. 









 I think [Liebestraum No. 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpOtuoHL45Y) by Liszt would've worked well for this episode. It's familiar sounding but not as overused as Clair de Lune. 




 That's an odd watching habit. After 200 shows a rational person would have an idea of their taste for anime and know what shows to pick up and what to avoid. 









 The dialogue between Kousei and Kaori was serene with a touch of melancholy. Great stuff.

Unless the mangaka backtracks, I think in the end the story would just imply that Kaori is terminally ill but not actually show her death. I think this way it makes her story more about the way she lived instead of that she died.

 Mostly agree with you. It's hard to get into the symbolism and surreal expression of ideas without an interesting narrative and engaging character drama. It almost feels like Ikuhara came up with the ideas and symbolisms first and then haphazardly attached a story and characters to them. In contrast to his other work, Utena, the characters were the heart of the show and the symbolism were built around them.  




 I really really hope that the 2nd season of Knights of Sidonia receive the same quality of character animation. It probably won't though due to a most likely lower budget. With the Ghibli name attached to Ronja, Polygon got some good funding from NHK. 




 Mattis is getting all the hate and deservedly so but the Borkas were awful with their ungrateful attitude towards Ronja's sacrifice. Let us not forget they also shot first. 




 While Maria is performing good deeds, Saint Micheal is partially right that heavenly or witch interference whenever something bad happens messes too much with the natural order of things. Although he's also in the extreme end by not doing anything. Like with most matters, moderation is key.

Maria tries to stop the war mostly for the selfish reason of hating it, which results in her not seeing the bigger picture.

So, Saint Micheal does have a point but he's just a dick about it. With that said you should all still convert to Wicca and worship thy Goddess Maria.

 One of the best anime shows ever. I'm not sure if this is the right way to describe it, but it's a mentally and emotionally demanding show.

Also, this was a spin-off of the bakeneko arc from Ayakashi: Samurai Horror Tales. I recommend watching that arc. 




 That court system is rigged! But I'll overlook the injustice because it was too sexy.

Shaba-da-doo 




 Mattis straight up turned sinister, almost like a completely different character.

Ronja's voice actress delivered a great performance. Also, in dramatic scenes like this, phonetically animated lip syncing is a huge difference maker in terms of bringing the characters' emotions to life.

 This episode left out a decent amount stuff from the manga. It was still nice but I would've preferred that it adapted most of the material since they're good. It also sped up the pace a bit and for shows like this I prefer a slower build up towards the big moments. Makes it more gratifying.

Perhaps they just changed the order of things.

 The fansub releases are so irregular which kind of kill the incentive to discuss the show. 

At least I don't think it's as dead as the Sanzoku no Musume Ronja threads. 




 Sounds like this might be his third feature length film. I think his two feature length films (The Place Promised in Our Early Days and Children Who Chase Lost Voices) were his weaker works. His character writing is great and shorter films play to that strength but longer films require more storytelling which I think he struggles a bit with. For longer films having a co-writer might be of benefit, just like Hosoda had Satoko Okudera as a co-writer. 




 Kaori smiled! I'll take any positive thing I can get. I also really liked that Tsubaki has come to accept her feelings for Kousei but also understood how delicate his situation is. I just wished this was done right after chapter 29.

The Watari and Kousei dialogue was great and handled with a light touch that made it feel genuine. Kousei was in anguish but not super angsty. Watari was supportive but not pushy.

 Melodrama is not inherently bad writing. It's just another tool at the writer's or director's disposal. Whether it turns out well or not depends on how it is used.

This subreddit has a habit of attaching negative connotation to tropes and cliche, which is lazy criticism and lacks critical thinking. What should be criticized is how the trope is used and not the trope itself.

This was to boost scoring as a response to the low scoring finals between the Spurs and the Pistons. In that list there were six players attempting more than 10 or more free throws per game. 




 I want continuation of these shows:

**Natsume's Book of Friends** under Studio Ghibli with Takahiro Omori still as the director.

**Kino's Journey** under Studio Ghibli with Hiroshi Nagahama (Mushi-shi) as the director.

**The Beast Player Erin** under Studio Ghibli directed by Hiromasa Yonebayashi (The Secret World of Arrietty) or Omori

**Tetsuwan Birdy: Decode** under Ufotable with Kazuki Akane still as the director.

**Chihayafuru** and **NANA** done by same studio and director (MADHOUSE and Morio Asaka).

For original projects:

A sci-fi show written by Kenji Kamiyama (Gits: SAC and Eden of the East), under Polygon Pictures and directed by Yutaka Izubuchi, Mamoru Oshii or Shinichiro Watanabe.

Any movie project by Makoto Shinkai, Mamoru Hosoda and Yasuhiro Yoshiura.

Pixar collaboration with the above directors.

Breakout project for Kiyotaka Oshiyama (Space Dandy "The Big Fish is Huge, Baby") and Yasuhiro Nakura (Space Dandy "A World with No Sadness, Baby") 




 Always liked Kuroda's composure. He's rarely ever rattled and just fights through bad spots.  









 When they suggested doing the horses in CG, I immediately thought of the horse animation in Sanzoku no Musume Ronja, which I thought looked pretty nice.

They even animated some of the mannerisms.

 I'm kind of surprised by how stern of a teacher Kousei ended up being but in a good way since it's evident of how his character has changed. 




 I think the whole substitute thing was just playful teasing by Kaori that Kousei sort of took to heart. I think even Watari realizes this, hence the scene when he asked Kaori if she likes Kousei and why he keeps encouraging him.

I also think Kaori, unlike Tsubaki, is fully aware of her feelings for Kousei. She just strikes me as a more honest character (to herself). But as you mentioned her terminal illness makes fully engaging difficult. 




 Loving Plum's development. 




 I think turning him into a teacher is a nice development as long as that's the extent of their interaction. But I agree, the placement of the new character intro is an odd one since I was expecting more Tsubaki stuff. 




 The scaling down on the drama was kind of abrupt, especially since it has been so excellent and substantial to Tsubaki's development. I hope the manga doesn't put Tsubaki on hold but I think that's what's going to happen which would be a shame.  









 Showing Ronja take a nice hot bath to emphasize how badly the Borkas have it with their food and water shortage was a nice touch.

It also kind of bothered me that Koyuki never bothered learning english until the end of the manga.
 














 I got confused and thought the colonists already got annihilated but right now that's what they're trying to prevent. I believe those colonists were the group of pacifist that wanted to leave Sidonia. Wouldn't be surprised if the Captain is using them as a lure.

 It's unfortunate the Karen Kimishima story got cut out. That small arc was pretty hilarious. 














 Whoever did the GUI design for Sidonia should get a raise. Interplay between HQ and the battlefield was excellent as always, I think this is what sets KoS apart from other anime with large scale battles.

 Just Genocidal Organ but I'm definitely planning to read Harmony. Unfortunately there's no translation for The Empire of Corpses yet. Hopefully that would come out before the blu-ray release. 




 Genocidal Organ was incredibly depressing. Hopefully the film can capture the oppressive and dreary feeling the novel had. 

It was also densely packed with ideas relating to technology, philosophy, psychology, sociology, and politics. Even though it can feel academic at times, it was for the most part thought provoking.

 The playerbase around 3 million or so. I really doubt most of the players who watched the anime liked it. Personally, I know of several people who disliked it along with others that I've talked to on the internet.

Conjecture and anecdotal evidence are far worse than small sample size data. My point of contention is people better have data to back it up if they're going to claim something is hated by the majority. 




 Looking at the [Niconico survey results](http://zakitakubu.com/2015/04/04/kancolle-achieves-39-1-not-good-rating-on-niconico-live-survey/) it seems like the majority of fans like the anime except for the final episode.

 [They really don't look that similar](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CDiu_6_W8AAt0wM.jpg). 




 I think so far the anime is doing a good job of condensing the story but if you're enjoying this then I think you will love the full experience of the manga. Go read it! 




 The scuffles were more entertaining than the Klitschko and Demetrious Johnson fights. 




 I went back to the space scene. The camera was moving at 24 fps but there were times the characters would start jittering which made it look like a framerate problem. Also in these first few episodes I've noticed some panning and tilting shots where the camera moved at 12 fps, which I don't think happened in the first season. I think Polygon might have been stretched thin since Ronja was two cours and demanded more manpower for higher quality art and animation.

 I got a feeling the director saw Gravity and decided to copy the single shot free-moving camera work for the dialogue scene in space. Thought it looked good and might be the first time I've seen a long take with dynamic camera movement in anime. 




 Jesus, that throw to first by Betances was scary. 




 I'm really curious how the adaptation will handle the heavy psychological, philosophical and political exposition and discourse that were present in Genocidal Organ.

Still haven't read Harmony. 









 Sometimes Jarrett Jack hero ball works but a lot of the time it makes me want to throw the remote at the tv.

  Quite honestly - when Lebron was 21, he wasn't as good at basketball as Davis is now.

As a 21 year old Lebron average 31.4/6.6/7. Lead the league with a VORP of 9.5 compared to Davis's 5.7 this year. 




 Alright, time to start watching Sazae-san. 




 More than halfway through **Bamboo Blade**. Simple characters and story but it's very charming and funny. It's a bit like Hanayamata but with Kendo, and with less drama and more laughs.

Also, I think the English dub is great. 




 YES 




 Oh wow I forgot that Ian Eagle and the Czar are also doing this game. I like this duo better.

 I guess this is what it would look like if Tatsuya Shiba became a chef. 









 Kyubei's SFX penis crying along with her was the funniest part.

I was expecting a gag with Kondo being NTR'd by Ham-san.

 









 Every season I sometimes pickup an anime with a wacky concept (e.g. Kancolle, Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei) just for the novelty of it and with very little expectations. This was my pick for this season and it was definitely better than expected. But now I have some expectations for it and the prospect of adapting a bunch of chapters into 12 episodes doesn't sound too encouraging. I think as long as the show remains funny I'll be satisfied, then give the manga a read sometime later. 









 When they showed that tiny cyborg ninja standing on the puddle of that girl's blood I had to rewind to make sure that really happened. I need to know more about that finger slicer.

Kind of disappointed that the phonetic lip syncing and expressive facial animation that Polygon did in Sanzoku no Musume Ronja didn't carry over to season 2 of Sidonia. This pretty much suggests the budget difference between the two. Action scenes still looked great with great sense of speed. 




 The "sloth on head" got a good chuckle out of me. The light hearted humor continues to be funny. The usage of narrator had some good comedic timing.

Also, gotta give NHK some love for always backing two cour shows.

 [This episode might be more about feet than music.](http://imgur.com/a/JuSAZ) Joking aside some of the shots of feet animation were clever use of body language to express emotion. 




 The problem is the 60 fps is just frame interpolation not actual animation. CG actually hand animated at 60 fps would look great but the man-power and budget required would be ridiculous even for Disney/Pixar and Dreamworks. CG at 60 fps with the use of Mo-cap is probably doable though. 




 These are animated at 12 fps. They look pretty fluid.

 Nadai is a hell of a drug.

Yona in that dancing outfit. I wonder what's the connection between Hak and Lili. My best guess is they were arranged to be married when they were kids.

It seems like these arcs are building up to a bigger conflict with the Kai Empire. 




 Nataru Fights (Birdy the Mighty: Decode 02). So emotionally driven to the point they were cathartic.

 









 This is something Tony Stark would do. 




 That fight sequence was kind of sloppy. The character and camera movements kept switching between right-to-left and left-to-right with very little continuity connecting those switches. The lack of sense of direction made it feel so disjointed. 




 He seemed very aware of the potential of a sucker punch. Someone can be trained but if they lack that awareness they could still get caught with a punch. 




 This show struggled to make sense of each conflict for every arc and the girls role in mitigating it. Character motives, why people are fighting, what they're fighting about and other story elements just get jumbled together. The show's redeeming qualities are the girls were really endearing and at times the animation and art were vividly colorful and energetic. 




 But Erika is more into BL.
 




 Logic was already ignored when people think a show without a high budget can look like a high budget quality show by simply switching studios.

Other than the character design changes I didn't think the animation and art this season was any worse than the last.  




 I know you guys love Madhouse but it's kind of odd there's not a single praise for Yuzuru Tachikawa, the creator, writer, and director of the show. 









 [Death Parade Episode 12 - Cinematography](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2015/03/death-parade-episode-12.html)  




 Hmm...plans for the 2nd season was announced on November 2014, that's news to me. First season sold really bad (374 discs first week sales). The backers must have known this would be the case from the start, so the anime series was mainly for the promotion of the Garo franchise.

I'm in for the 2nd season. The 1st season had an uneven quality but nothing egregiously dislikeable. It also had some great moments and overall the show was entertaining. 




 [Source](https://youtu.be/GZ39V34qInQ) 









 [](/s "Can I lie?"). Such a great moment and memorable line. 




 That would've been a great quietly dramatic scene if it was a minute shorter and had an actual payoff. 




 [From this short movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWMnzbj61mc feature=youtu.be)

[Brief write-up on it](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2015/03/645-am-sun-31-august-2014.html) 














 The "Dark Dragon" name gets a funnier use later on.

Also the chapters after this finale are seriously funny. 









 That fight was a riot. It had a fireman's carry throw, rear naked choke, "look over there" trick, ear pulling and a Rocky-ish music. The other robbers' reaction were amusing too. 




 Technically it's not even a revival as this episode made clear she can't bring the dead back to life. 




  I must admit I pity her for choosing him.

I think she's just using him. 




 Thank god, Galfa's character didn't get the redemption route. I was worried that might happen after Joseph's "I admired you" speech. That character was irredeemable. I think he was basically an allegorical character that represented the negative qualities of humans, such as jealousy, greed, dishonesty and etc. 









 You should've formed your own club where you look for time travelers, espers and aliens. 




 Have you watched Shirobako? How accurate is its depiction of the anime industry? 




 At this point I'm all for Asseylumnator plot twist. 




 Then come back alive for another season. 









 I really didn't see anything wrong with the CGI in this PV. I swear, the CG could have top notch quality cel shading with Pixar level animation and people would still complain. 














 [Death Parade Episode 11 - Cinematography](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2015/03/death-parade-episode-11.html) 









 I wonder if this might get a live action J-drama adaptation. I'd definitely give it a watch if that happens. 




 This was my second read through so it didn't affect me as much but I remember being close to tearing up at the "I love you" part. The nice slow build up to that part was what made it so emotive.

The rooftop scene was practically Kaori's love confession so this letter was more of a reinforcement of her feelings and less of a confession beyond the grave. Although some may feel it's still the latter and be peeved by it.

I thought it was a great manga. Kousei's character development had an ebb and flow to it instead of a linear progression. It made his development feel natural since people don't improve and change at a constant pace. The story was also very effective at demonstrating the notion of bonding, healing and expressing oneself through music. I think this was less of a love story and more of a human drama between two people supporting each other through music as they navigate lifes tribulations. 




 A lot of NYC subway platforms don't have enough space for proper line forming, especially the island platform ones.

For example: [The Wall Street Subway Platform](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Wall_Street_Subway.jpg) 




 I missed how fun these Karasuno guys can be. Is there enough material yet for a second season? 




 The episode gets you all hyped up for the duel and then cliff hanger. Next episode should be fun. 




 They would also adjust by hand if they don't like the preset mouth shapes for certain scenes.

 I think if you look at their relationship from a purely romantic standpoint then youre not going to get much out of it. If you look at their relationship as human drama between two people supporting each other through music as they navigate lifes tribulations, then I think its a relationship thats layered and gratifying. 




 Whenever I see the ED with Lara in it my heart sinks a bit. 









 [Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso Episode 21 - Cinematography ](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2015/03/shigatsu-wa-kimi-no-uso-your-lie-in.html) 




 It's probably already flooded with tears.

I thought I was ready for that rooftop scene after finishing the manga. Nope, it still got a few tears out of me. 




 I would have preferred if we heard Mattis's side of the story that lead to the reunion. It was still touching though.  




 I hope Marion comes back healthy. I'm curious to see what a perimeter defense of LeBron, Shumpert and Marion would look like. 




  edit: I think CG in anime actually suffer more from the simple motions rather than the complex. They can be wonderfully fluid when complex, but look robotic when it's just a simple tilt of the head.

http://gfycat.com/GeneralPlumpIggypops

I think that's pretty damn good.

 




 Episodes 47-50 of Cross Game were the most gratifying moments in anime I've ever experienced. Episode 47 is really damn memorable especially the line Kou delivered. 




 You're right about the inconsistent quality of character animation but there are plenty of traditional anime that are worse but we give it a pass because we have gotten used to it.

Actually one of the best character and facial animation I've seen in anime is from Sanzoku no Musume Ronja, another CG show done by Polygon.

 This reminded me how well shot this anime was. Yeah, the video cherry picked the best shots but the entirety of the first season had good quality cinematography.

Shizuno did a great job directing the first season. I'm a bit nervous about the second season being directed by a first time director (Hiroyuki Seshita). 




 After this season ends, it's manga marathon time for me.

I had enough self control to stop reading around the time they met Ki-ja but after seeing what's about to develop I just can't wait for the 2nd season that might not come. 




 Thank god we have two more episodes. It would've been painful if the season ended that way. This episode packed so much hype; Jaeha flying to the rescue, we get to see more of Shinah skills, Yona's killer instinct and "the reunion."

Really liked how Yona's development through a climactic external conflict was followed by her having to face her internal conflict, which is her feelings for Soo-Won. Pretty damn excited about the reactions from Yona, Soo-Won and Hak in the final two episodes.

Also, Hak is barely making any progress with Yona as it is and now Soo-Won shows up.  




 Read this chapter and then chapter 44...ahh that feeling of enveloping sadness. I was welling but the dam didn't quite break. I think anime will do that if executed really well.

I really appreciate that it didn't go big for the tear jerker, like having Kousei by Kaori's deathbed or something equally superfluously morose. The manga stayed true to her story which is not about that she's terminally ill but the way she lived and her connection with Kousei. 




 The hand washing scene was excellently storyboarded. The graphic match cuts of Kousei and Kaori's hands working in rhythm with the alternating silence and sound of running water was serenely melancholic.

Also really liked the reserved use of canted framing. It was saved for the right moments. A lot of anime tend to overuse canted shots when things get tense or dramatic and the effect gets lost. The hand washing scene saved it for the last shot and it worked well as a visual supplement to Kousei's emotions.  




 Not sure if I'm describing this right but the dialogue between Ronja and Lovis, and her summer speech felt prose-like.

21 episodes in and I'm still loving the mouth animation. Really gonna miss that once this is over.

Also don't watch the preview.  














 I thought the Yuuge episode was pretty light hearted except for the [](/s "unhappy marriage part"). I also liked all of them since they touched on different aspects of life but the last one was really depressing. 




 The show cracked Japan's top ten animation TV ratings a few times, so it's doing well. S2 is highly likely. 




 Reinhard von Lohengramm

"Heil Kaiser Reinhard" 







































 $250,000 covers a budget of one episode. Maybe two for a really cheap series which Death Parade isn't, judging from its quality.

NTV who owns Madhouse also owns Hulu Japan, so at least Death Parade functions as an original content to their catalog. Original content is becoming more important since Netflix is launching in Japan this fall. So it's not a total loss, but I wouldn't get my hopes up for a 2nd season. Although it would be a very pleasing surprise if it happens.  




 I don't use it because of the ghosting. The smoothness is cool for a 1-3 minute scene but I wouldn't be able to stand watching a whole series with ghosting.

Also there's not a lot of actual 60 fps content other than sports broadcast and some porn. The Hobbit trilogy was shot at 48 fps. Most movies and TV shows are 24 fps. A traditional animation TV show is basically 12 fps upscaled to 24 fps with repeated frames.
 









 That was an exciting episode of mostly just action scenes. Being able to convey sense of speed and the frenzy of combat was always this show's signature. I also like how the action can seamlessly transition from a wide shot of the battle to an up-close and personal view of it. There might be better choreographed action scenes out there but in terms of the full package that gets the heart racing this show's action might be the best of all the recent anime.

Some nitpicks: there were a few spots when it got choppy, some in slowmo and others during a few camera moves. There were a couple of Transformer-esque angles and super quick cuts that made things momentarily hard to follow.

 I try to keep up with indie anime short films. There's some odd and experimental stuff that are a nice change of pace from the usual.

 All these wishes, witches and memories are all getting mixed up in my head. Well, it's really not complicated if you reread and think about it but it disrupts the page-turner feel of the manga. It's not bad, just different flow to the story.

 Hak going into rage mode was intense.

[This page](http://www.titaniascans.com/reader/Akatsuki+no+Yona/091%3A+He+Was+a+Very+Precious+Friend/#page=25) really expressed the mixture of anger and sadness. The way Yona calmed him down was moving. The last few pages of that chapter were a fantastic mixture of emotions.

I thought we might see Zeno's ability in this arc. A bit disappointed that wasn't the case.
 




 A cut, in visual mediums, is the abrupt transition from one scene to another. 

A cut is a transition from one shot to another. A scene is made up of shots sequenced together with multiple cuts. Although there are scenes that are just one continuous shot (oner/long take). 




 [He's a count/bishop that got assassinated by a disembodied arm](http://i.imgur.com/fNtMruG.jpg). Bodin blamed the Parsians and wanted 10,000 sacrificed as revenge.

I also quite liked this [exchange between Guiscard and Bodin](http://i.imgur.com/Dn3S3id.jpg), which wasn't in this episode due to the changes. 




 The guy worked his ass off to get to the pinnacle of his profession, he should be damn proud of that. He shouldn't have to act humble on account of some idiot's fuck up. 




 I guess the Pedelaus incident got skipped. It's what caused Bodin to asked for 10,000 Parsians to sacrifice.

Is the rest going to be anime original? The sequence of events in this episode is drastically different from the LN/manga.
  














 The smoke and fog effects looked great. The fogginess really made the battle atmospheric. I wish the explosions were of the same quality, just like the one in the Blame! clip.

Did not expect Benisuzume to make an appearance, and it's a 2.0 version. So Gaunas are also attracted to Higgs particles. Time to switch to an alternative fuel source!

 I wouldn't say he got shoved but he was going hard to the basket and a slight push while in the air would be enough to get him off balance. But since the Cavs lost the popular narrative is LeBron flopped into the camera.

 I love how Kyubei goes into an honest introspection of her gender conflict only to end with this [punchline](http://i.imgur.com/r7zc8fl.png). 




 While Ribbon-girl could have approached this trumpet solo drama in a more tactful manner, I liked that she questioned authority and was openly confrontational instead of rumor mongering behind Reina's and Taki-sensei's backs. No half measures, no wishy-washy shenanigans, just straight-up going for the truth. 




 I couldn't get into Expelled from Paradise. Too much storytelling through exposition instead of through character experiences, sequence of events and observable world building. I got nothing against exposition but the movie needed a better balance between telling and showing. 









 So, does Kevin Love get the [Yamcha pose?](http://i.imgur.com/CRbY6M4.jpg) 




 The Hawks and Bulls weren't as bad as people made them out to be. This Cavs defense is legit. 




 I thought the Kashan Castle chapter would be two episodes, still not bad. The anime has pretty much caught up to the translated LN chapters.

I hope the next update to the LN translation would be a big one.

 Although I wanted a full season, I'm just happy to get more Aria.

I'm guessing the first two episodes are anime original written by Junichi Sato and Reiko Yoshida. I'm hoping they have more written material waiting to be made into an anime series if this three episode OAV becomes a big hit.

edit:

For anyone new to the series, it's available on youtube and Hulu.

 The production committee determines the budget of the show. Sure, sometimes the studio is part of the committee and invest money into the project but they sure as hell don't finance the whole thing. 




 A majority of action scenes in Sidonia are animated at 24 fps. That's twice the framerate of traditional anime.

 God damn. Hak showing up at the end got me hyped.

It was also nice seeing Yona recover from being overwhelmed by the situation. 




 This show continues to have unusually high amount of shots of feet. A lot of times they're used as another way to express emotion and personality, and sometimes for more practical reasons. I'm half expecting someone to do a video essay on it, just like [Tony Zhou did one on chairs.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfGKNJ4mldE) 




 There's actually been a character like that, Nanamine Tooru from Bakuman. 














 Could still be manga territory if they're using unpublished rough drafts.  














 Yuhata is back in the harem game. I'm fine with the harem hijinks as breather episodes and this episode was amusing but three in a row is pushing it. I want to get back to the scheming, action and tension.

Izana's new abilities to control a Garde looks promising. It seems like there's going to be a conflict between Yure and the Captain. 

Maybe it's just me but the animation and overall presentation looked so much better in this episode. Especially the lighting; [construction site](http://imgur.com/a/jPe36#2), [sunset](http://imgur.com/a/5gYxC#0), [morning light](http://imgur.com/a/l4K1u#0) and [Thousand Year Village](http://i.imgur.com/K9mZHBP.jpg).

 It's still not true 60 fps interpolated since the 24 fps source has repeated frames due to the anime being animated in 2s. Repeated frames can't be interpolated since there's no motion going on. 




 I think for a lot of these shows the studio is really just a hired contractor. The sales are financially inconsequential to the studio and the ones that either profit or lose money from sales is the production committee that hired the studio and financed the whole project. Obviously the studio wants the show to sell well since it could make them look good and help them land more and better projects but as long as they keep getting new projects then I don't think sales are a be all and end all. That's why Deen, Satelight and Pierrot are still in business.

Also it's not all about disc sales. Some shows are made as promotional material for manga, LN, video games, merchandise and as part of a multimedia project. Additionally, ratings matter a bit more for non-late-night shows. Some of these reasons are also why recent late-night anime like Garo and Rage of Bahamut are getting 2nd seasons despite not selling well. 




 Children and daytime shows are also more stable income since they tend to be 2 cours or long running. I'd bet most studios would love to land a long running show. 




 I bursted out laughing when Gintoki accidentally robbed the bank. Gintoki's trolling was the perfect build-up for that moment.

 He got a triple double but he gotta tease us with an almost 30-20. 









 The number of shows indicates an increased interest in investing in anime. These shows are funded by manga, LN and video game publishers, toy/merchandise companies, TV Networks, marketing/advertising firms and other investors with varying interests. There's more to anime now than disc sales, merchandise sales and boosting manga sales. Using anime to promote LNs and video games is now common practice. We are seeing more multimedia projects that include anime. Then there's the relatively new found wealth known as streaming. Like I said, anime is the most ubiquitous as it has ever been with it being streamed on netflix, hulu, funimation, crunchyroll and other smaller streaming sites. Of course I also said this boom is not sustainable.

Regarding anime... remember how a cour used to be 13 episodes, and most shows were 2 cours? I think it's telling studios can't really afford buying airtime anymore. And the money certainly isn't going to employees.

Two cour late night shows are risky. Production committees have just gotten smarter. If the first cour is a success then they'll make another one. There's still bunch of two cour shows, most of them are daytime because TV networks don't want to reload their time slot every three months. Also studios don't usually pay for the airtime, the investors in the production committee do. Studios for the most part are hired contractors. The exception to that being when a studio wants to make an original anime or invest their own money in exchange for a larger slice of the pie.

 




 [Manga](/s "Kotori Moegi's mini-arc was great, so was Konno's. I think those two were only bested by Noa's. Also, Aiko Chikushi was hilarious") 




 The anime was doing a good job of condensing the material early on but it's starting to feel rushed now. It was unavoidable, 90 chapters in one cour is tough to adapt no matter how good the writing staff is. Then again, as a manga reader my perspective is probably skewed, it seems like most anime only watchers are fine with the pacing.

[For Otsuka fans](https://streamable.com/ll8u) 




 Well, he was disappointingly unspecific but then again his doom and gloom assessments has always been like that. Anime is in a boom right now, producing 30-40 shows a season and the most ubiquitous as it has ever been. Saying that's unsustainable is pointing out the obvious and can be said about any industry going through a boom period.

It might have been worthwhile if he pointed out the declining relevance of physical media which will eventually affect the industry and the possibility of a demand for higher wage which will raise production costs.

However, Mr. Anno does not think that this will mean an end to anime as an artistic form of film. He points out the possibility of the centres of anime production moving to other areas of Asia with good conditions.

Certain parts of anime production are already being outsourced to other Asian studios because it's cheaper. Being payed worse than an already underpaid Japanese animator isn't exactly good working condition. I doubt it'll change so drastically in five years that the industry would move outside of Japan. 




 That moment must have been cathartic for Dwight Howard haters. 




 Shirou is a walking and talking meatbag of idiocy with his extremely simple minded and comical sense of heroism. I root for his death with every episode. I should stop watching FSN.

 It's more like his harem is reloading. Hoshijiro is out and got replaced by Tsumugi. Yuhata has kind of fallen out of the harem and Samari is picking up the slack. 




 [Looked like he was chugging some sake.](http://i.imgur.com/GmRiquJ.png) 




 After an extended break, harem hijinks are in full swing for a second episode in a row.

It's not all feel good stuff though, the Captain is really going all in with her arms race against the Gaunas and the colonists are more screwed than I thought. 

[Izana's suit malfunction](https://streamable.com/448z) 




 lol true but when he has to deal with someone as illogically stubborn as Shirou it's hard to blame him for taking the asshole route to get his point across. Although in the end it was all for naught. 




 We saw Saber get owned by a mere human with some magical enhancements, this story has some wacky power scale logic. So I kind of expected the Shirou nonsense. 




 To be fair the Avalon plot armor was built in from the very beginning, so it wasn't a total ass-pull...but yeah still plot armor.

 Nothing fancy, the Garo video is just the 24 fps source converted to 60 fps motion interpolated. Here's the avisynth script that I used:

     SetMemoryMax(512)
     SetMTMode(3,Cores)
     PluginPath = "C:\Program Files (x86)\MeGUI\tools\avisynth_plugin\"
     LoadPlugin(PluginPath+"svpflow1.dll")
     LoadPlugin(PluginPath+"svpflow2.dll")
     Import(PluginPath+"InterFrame2.avsi")
     input.ConvertToYV12()
     SetMTMode(2)
     deinterlace
     crop
     denoise
     resize
     InterFrame(Cores=Cores)

 [The actress that played her in the live action is also cute.](http://i.imgur.com/E7r0a9Z.jpg) 









 Well, this really isn't true 60 fps motion interpolated since the repeated frames from the 24 fps source were included. I believe this is true for most 60 fps converted anime videos with the exception of CG scenes animated at 24 fps.

I did experiment with getting rid most of the repeated frames and just using the animated frames by cutting the fps to 12. Then motion interpolating up to 60 fps but it looked bad. So much ghosting, even just going from 12 to 24 looked bad. The posted video still have ghosting but nowhere near as bad.

Did another one:

 Oh man, they took out the part during the invasion where Gieve went to a temple to whoop some Lusitanian ass in order to get more loot. Also, I'm pretty sure the Lusitanian King wasn't fat in the light novel. The light novel also took more effort to characterize him as a religious fanatic which even made his desire to marry Tahamine even more surprising.

 Also that Gauna emitter looks means in the preview, not quite sure what it provides Sidonia when they already have missiles that can blow up planets, but I guess they are kind limited?

The Anti-Planet Missiles can be dodged or intercepted that's why in the last season they had to use the Gardes to get rid of the Gauna first in order to let the missile destroy the dwarf planet. 




 Show by Rock! 




 In terms of manpower, time and effort there's a huge difference between 3-5 minute CG scenes per episode and doing an entire series in CG. That's why only the action scenes in Sidonia are fluidly animated.

Sorachi: Makes people think, Do these people want to die? 

Saitou: Its like we stepped into a mine field.

Ive been watching the re-airs at home lately, and I think if I ever have children, Ill never let them watch it. It airs at 6pm, but theres always someone saying p*nis or whatever, its terrible. It takes things too far, doesnt it, this competition mindset? 

Sorachi: I cant lose! (laugh) 

Oonishi: The Tower of Babylon (Lesson 88) aired at 6pm, yknow. 

Saitou: The Tower of Babylon... That was a bit too much. (laugh) 

Oonishi: The neighboring channel is airing Good children lets watch this! (translation) Meanwhile, this channel is airing mosaics. This might be unacceptable even for a late-night show. 

Sorachi: A forced cut and an abrupt ending, this is the true style of Gintama. But the higher-ups might get into trouble. 

Oonishi: And then it revives when its moved to the late-night slot.

 I liked that some of them left. That was real. However well thought out and logical policy changes are, when applied in such a sudden, sweeping and inconsiderate way it will make employees unhappy. If they're talented with sought out skills then they will leave for a place where they can happily pursue their career goals. People will call it selfish or entitled but to me that's life. 




 Eh. It's not so black and white. It's a good portrayal of chasm that sometimes exists between management and employees. The employees don't take the larger picture into account. The management just sees them as numbers and not actually people with thoughts and emotions.

 The anime is a major way for Bandai to market the game prior to release. It being delayed to the fall season will severely limit their marketing. ~~It also makes me wonder why Bandai didn't choose Sunrise to do God Eater since they own that studio. They probably thought Ufotable's style was a better fit but I bet some of them are thinking right now that they should've went with Sunrise.~~ Forgot that Ufotable worked on the God Eater games and a bunch of Bandai games and that's why they were hired. 




 Doubt it. Ufotable strikes me as a studio that would only take projects with a good budget to maintain their high standard of art and animation. They just don't seem to have much experience with juggling multiple series since they usually only make one per year. I'm guessing that inexperience with schedule constraints is what causing the production problems. 









 Digital Frontier is doing the CG. They did the CG for Resident Evil: Damnation. They also did the CG sections in Wolf Children including the [snow scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGWzwpVBZSE)

Those looked pretty good to me but then again anime series production compared to film production is a different story in terms of budget and time management. That difference being budget and time are more constrained in TV anime production.

To me the more interesting part of this announcement is Digital Frontier possibly doing more CG anime series production. A competition between them and Polygon is good for advancing the tech in CG anime.

 Solid 2nd season but not as good as the first which had more tension and better sense of eminent danger.

As for the finale, the continuation of the battle was a bit underwhelming compared to the last episode. Maybe the finale would have been better off as being purely a resolution episode. That would also mean condensing all the battle in the 11th episode, which I would not have liked.

The orbital bombardment sequence was absolutely badass and the sound design was glorious.

 Dunno. The disk sales per volume are down by 2,000 from the first season. If the producers don't want to do a third season maybe netflix will pick it up since they'll be launching in Japan soon and might want some new content for that audience. 




 Haha. Never seen someone gain fans with his performance then lose them immediately with a post fight speech. 














 Hopefully Tanaka and Pineda can get out of their slump soon.

 A natural 220 pounder would be considered a small heavyweight and would rather cut 15 lbs to make LHW. A 200 pounder would cut 15 lbs to make MW instead of fighting 220 pounders cutting down to LHW. Some of these fighters have no choice but to cut weight in double digits since the difference in weight divisions is large.

 Weight cuts are unavoidable when anything above lightweight have 15-20 lbs between divisions. Some fighters just naturally fall in between and they would rather cut down than fight bigger guys.

 Shinpachi's straight-man routine was on point this episode when he was describing Tsukuyo and Sa-chan.

Sorachi just went all "gender is a social construct" with that Gintoki-Kyubei dialogue.
