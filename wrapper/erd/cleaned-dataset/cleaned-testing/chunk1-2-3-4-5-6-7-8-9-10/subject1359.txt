 Confirmed. Sad but true.
You have a You have a LESS than 1 in 32,468,436 chance of winning that lottery. Here are some other odds for the sake of comparison:
You have about a 1 in 2,000,000 chance of being struck by lightning.

A pregnant woman has a 1 in 705,000 chance of giving birth to quadruplets.

Someone eating an oyster has a 1 in 12,000 chance of finding a pearl inside of it.

Now, lottery odds can be pretty incomprehensible. How can we possibly have any "feeling" for the number 32,468,436? To help you with this, here's a little experiment you can try to "get a handle on" what a 1 in 32,468,436 chance really means.

Get a piece of rope or string, that's 59 feet long.

In a wide open area, arrange the rope or string in a circle, end to end, the best you can.

Get a single grain of sand or dirt (use tweezers!) and place it anywhere you wish inside the circle.

Get a second grain of sand. Close your eyes, and "disorient" yourself as to where the grain of sand is that you placed inside of the circle (have someone spin you around or something!).

While you're inside the circle, drop the second grain of sand from 1 foot up.

Your chances of hitting the first grain of sand with the second is roughly equal to the odds of "1 in 32,468,436."

If the rope's length mentioned in #1 is a little unreasonable, for every foot above the circle that you drop the second grain of sand, you can reduce the length of the string by the same amount. For example, if you dropped the second grain of sand from a ladder 10 feet up, you'd need a length of string that is 10 times shorter than the one in #1, or a 59/10 = 5.87008 foot long piece of string.

The jackpot is so large, someone with enough money could theoretically buy up every single combination of winning numbers, thereby guaranteeing a winning ticket  but only if you suspended the laws of physics.

A $540 million jackpot, if taken as a $390 lump sum and after federal tax withholding, works out to about $293 million. With the jackpot odds at 1 in 176 million, it would cost $176 million to buy up every single combination. Under that scenario, the strategy would win $117 million  less if your state also withholds taxes.

But there are too many limitations. First, if it takes five seconds to fill out each card, you'd need almost 28 years just to mark the bubbles on the game tickets. You'd also use up the national supply of special lottery paper and lottery-machine printing ink well before all your tickets could be printed out.

And with a jackpot this large, experts say, there is more of a chance of multiple winners. If you have to share the jackpot with even one fellow winner, you've lost $30 million.

Mike Catalano, chairman of the mathematics department at Dakota Wesleyan University in Mitchell, S.D., said he covers the odds of winning in lottery games with his students in an attempt to show them how unlikely it is to win big.

He concedes the math is clear: The more tickets you buy, the better your chances of winning. So, if you buy 10 tickets filled out 10 different ways, your odds of winning the jackpot 10 in 176 million.

"You are about 50 times as likely to get struck by lightning as to win the lottery, based on the 90 people a year getting struck by lightning," Catalano said. "Of course, if you buy 50 tickets, you've equalized your chances of winning the jackpot with getting struck by lightning."

Based on other averages in the U.S., you're about 8,000 times more likely to be murdered than winning the lottery, and about 20,000 times more likely to die in a car crash that hit the lucky numbers, Catalano said.

"You might get some psychological enjoyment from playing the lottery, but from a financial standpoint... you'd be much better off going to Las Vegas and playing blackjack or the slot machines."

 I had one installed for a surprise for Valentines Day in my bedroom.
Had fun and enjoyed the novelty of it that night with the girl I'm dating after a couple bottles of wine.
I didn't have to work in the morning but she did so she left late that night.
As I awoke the next morning, a bit hungover, with the sun beaming through the window and almost had a heart attack when I opened my eyes cause I thought a naked guy was falling on me. 




 Do you get you bottom licked much?
My girlfriend wants to butt should I letter?
Please post a reply. 
























 By all means do. 




 Heard it somewhere years ago. It's my go2 skydiving funny comment. 




 I really don't have much in the way of social anxiety but I started by asking [online for a quote](http://giganticmirrors.com/contact-aj-wholesale-inc)
The installer was cool. Just another guy that I'll never see again and I broke the ice of making a joking comment about what it was for and set the tone of the install.

I groaned and congratulated him on being a grand dad.
