  http://www.netrootsnation.org/  I went 4 years ago and had a great time.   


































 This interview made me very anxious.  The interviewer sounds very reasonable.  How did Simpson get appointed to this committee?  And wouldn't it be great to have an intelligent interview with a committee member? 














 I'm a liberal, but this is getting too much for me.  Is it time that we "ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country." 

















































 My laptop picked up some virus on reddit last November.  There was a post on it at the time, but it was already too late.  If I remember right, it was not in windows or directly in reddit.  Now, I have to unplug my computer and remove the battery almost every time (not always, but most times) I boot up.  Does anyboy remember this and know how I can fix it.  I would appreciate any advice on this. 




















































































































































































































































 I told them I was a Democrat voting for Obama, but I am still getting thier robo calls! 




 The original was one of National Geographic's most memorable photos. 




 I posted the Guide as it can be helpful, particularly in nonpartisan judges races when you don't know who they are. 









 http://nevadavoterguide.com/
This is the progressive guide. 




 I guess when Republicans were crying about voter fraud, they were talking about  their own members.  I haven't heard or read of one incident by Democrats, but have read about destroying ballots in mulitple states. 




 How about government which doesn't create jobs, but Romney will create 12 million jobs as President? 




 I saw my niece's photo yesterday volunteering in a Romney campaign hdqtrs.  She had two children under medicaid, although she is now married to the father. 




 Harry Reid is a Democrat and a Mormon.  I know other Mormon Democrats. 




 Want to come to my house?  My pool needs replastering and repair! 




 Romney is Bush on steroids. 




 I'm watching CNN now stating Romney won.  Drives me crazzzzzyyyy. 




 I have a friend who is a CPA AND is an Oracle programmer.  Travels everywhere she wants. 




 That I could have done better. 




 I love you Paul Krugman. 




 Wow.  A lot of comments!  A co-worker and I discussed it.  We would offer $1 million to each co-worker who would walk away with us that day. 




 1890 or 1990? 




 I like that. 




 They also didn't want the economy at that time. 




 Yes, it is one more form of corporate welfare.  People need a living wage. 




 Wow.  I appreciate you summarizing it like this. 




 I been doing that for 40 yrs.  Getting too tired.  Just hope others can take over in greater numbers. 




 I agree, and their sleasiness. 




 I haven't read the article, but there is still too much talk about the grand deal.  We need to change the premise first. 




 Who would have thought Bush would win a second term?  Yes, these guys will stop at nothing.  Did you read the article about Bain owning the company that supplies a lot of the voting machines? 




 The existing super rich will end up with it ALL. 




 JFK, RK and MLK assassinations, and who was behind the plot to overthrow FDR. 




 You are so right.  Now, how do we convince others? 




 This is common.  The Post Office is a good example.  Congress voted them to keep 70 years (or 80, I don't remember the details) in retirement funds, which meant they would not have enough money to operate today.  Then they blame the PO mgmt for not being able to meet today's expenses. 




 Didn't the last guy who was going to testify about the 2004 presidential race in Ohio die? 









 And I can't even get some of my closest friends or family to see. 









 i am so tired of them, and their baby-like tantrums. 









 I used to play Diplomacy, but you need 6-8 people to play and it can be a long game. 




 Awesome view.  You can see five mountains lined up out the window.  I got a photo too, but was on a clear day with blue skies. 




 It is my biggest scare.  I don't have a choice though - Romney who promises cuts to SS, and Obama who has shown indication to deal with the republicans on this issue.  The last time there was a ss compromise was a disaster for some of us.  I'm looking at my future ss cut of $400 due to the last agreement.  What will they do this time? 




 Doesn't matter.  There are still enough people to vote for him no matter what he says or what his policies are. 






























































































































































































































































 I see these ads that you can build your own panels from factory seconds.

 It's a fun day trip to continue on from the date farm to Tecopa, Shoshone and then Death Valley. 




 A swimming pool.  I've had it empty for the last 6 years now because it costs too much to have it refinished,  and I'm concerned about the extra water and utility use with global warming.   




 I know.  I've been waiting my whole life. 
























 Years ago, we had a welfare march in my town to protest some of the policy decisions from our state that cut many people off the rolls.  There was also an anti-welfare march to support those policy decisions.  I later met the leader of the anti-welfare march.  He had had a heart attack, his wife left him, and he lost his house.  He was trying to get legal assistance when I met him.  It could happen to any of us.  Oh, and by the way, I just wish I would hear as much complaining about corporate welfare which probably surpasses all of the welfare programs - and generally ends up in just a few pockets. 




 You are right.  I meant cheaper to make. 




 If men and women make up that 60%, half would be 30%. 




 I love this! 




 I hurt for the younger generations, but I'm not sure that is the answer.  I want those programs there for them also. 




 Of course, I know what percent of taxes people pay.  Did you know that the top rate use to be 90%?  Money has been devalued on purpose!  I saw the head of the manufacturer's lobby on c-span during the Bush administration saying that was their goal.  They want goods to be cheap enough for Americans to afford them.  They also want to pay less for wages.  The bottom 45% pay a higher percentage of their wages in payroll taxes.  I think the low-income tax credit was a subsidy to businesses to be able to pay low wages to workers and still make huge profits.  I think in a sense that is what the Obamacare is also - a subsidy to companies like Wal-Mart who do not want to pay for health care for thier workers.  So we were all paying for it anyway, at hospital emergency rooms.  I worked at Welfare and saw the flyers Wal-Mart was giving to thier employees to go apply for medicaid.  What is right about that?  There is another submission I saw on Reddit today that says poor people get the same amount of GDP as do the rich in terms of tax benefits.  Found it:  http://www.reddit.com/tb/15di1o
 And contrary to some people's believes, the rich are not job creators.  It is only a race to the bottom.  We do better as individuals and as a country when we are all doing well, not just a few. 




  I hurt for the younger generations and we need to do what we can to help them, but at the risk of starving seniors?  We have enough for everyone.  Right now, corporation's chairmans and Presidents of their boards are walking away with all of the corporate profits.  Corporations have one goal:  profits, not the improvement of society or their workers.  



 




 You are making the assumption that it is all the fault of social security and medicare.  We have been spending a billion a week for years on a war.  Social security isn't even a part of the budget.  Boomers paid 110% more than they should have to cover the costs of social security.  Americans LOVE those programs and will pay for them.  This has been a plan by republicans to starve the beast - and get rid of those programs. 




 Yep. 




 You needed the spending to avoid a huge depression.  They used to call government spending "priming the pump", when private enterprise is not spending, government needs to spend.   It didn't cost much in interest rates.  Republicans screamed about the deficit during Clinton years - and poof - it was gone in no time when everyone went to work.  It is higher now, and it will stay high through the boomer's retirement, but it is not so excessive as to break the county.  Wiki "the two-santa theory".  Large Federal spending has been historically higher under republicans.  They don't mind big-government, they just mind big-government money being spent on regular people.  They love the military and contracting with private enterprise.  We can go off the cliff, then the republicans can vote for a tax-break for 90% of the people, just not the rich. 




 Nice photo. 




 I would like to believe you are right, but I know so many crazys! 




 There are some translating companies also. 




 How about first making employees full-time.  Too many now have part-time jobs. 




 I will have to watch it.  Saw her on C-Span and she was great. 




 Yeah, let's help the corporations. Screw the people. 









 It's wierd submitting a reddit article to a subreddit! 









 Diplomacy puts Risk to shame, but you need 5-7 players, and lots of time. 




 Remember, George Bush was a cheerleader when many students were protesting the war,  And Romney was leading protests for the war.  There were two kinds of boomers. 




 isn't that how we all got started? 




 Apply online at the mgmcareers.com.  They are the major employer on the strip.  Who knows.  People do get hired.  I also know a woman who recruits for them also, normally low-paying jobs like guestroom attendents.  Mail me your resume and I'll get it to her.  She may be able to chek out if they ever hire on HIB visas, or whatever. 




 I'm so impressed.  Wish I could do this.  




 I remember Nixon's people calling him "Ain't no Way". 




 I've been wondering, if people love medicare   social security, rather than cut them, let's pay a little more for them -- with the condition that Congress can't spend the money on anything else. 




 I can't believe he is a supreme court judge.  I heard him quoting Fox News during the health care case - and he was wrong about it!  An idiot. 




 I think it is funny. 




 Congrats.  I get about 40 lbs, then breakdown, gain it back.  How do you keep going? 




 They have limitless money and they never stop.  Ethics mean nothing. 




 Escargo. 




 I wrote a term paper 40 yrs on the end of work.  We are in a transition needing less people to do more.   Check this out:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_of_Work 




 Thank you for your thoughts. 




 I'd like to read the article! 




 I'm so tired of these boys.  Just go away..... 




 nice. 









 I'm curious too.  The areas look beautiful. 




 I keep thinking of Linda Tripp, the civil servant who screwed Monica Lewinsky and Clinton.  She was offered a much better job but without civil service benefits or protections.  She took it and a year later, was laid off.  I think this job was to entice DeMint to leave.  And he will be pushed out of his new job in a year. 




 Good luck! 




 What was your original industry?   









 I'm torn.  There is a side of me that says "You vote these guys in office, you deserve what you get".  The problem is that we all pay for it. 




 Idiot. 




 Is there a Veteran's sub-reddit?  This needs to be posted there. 









 The corporate scam, yes.  But wouldn't it be cool if we could all have it. 









 When is she up for election? 




 At one time, I build my own solar heater for my pool.  Just coiled black flexible pvc pipe on my patio roof and ran a hose through my skimmer.  The water pumped through the pipes, heated the water which flowed back into the pool.  The water in the pool was almost too hot in the summer. 




 It is totally corporate-controlled by state statute.  A co-worker had it installed on his home at an upfront cost of $50,000 (probably close to the value of my house).  He got a $15,000 rebate from NV Energy which was the exact charge of installation (and he turned it over to the installers).  I found a group online in suburban Washington D.C. was able to start a co-op with an average cost of $1,500 per house.  You can't do that here without a change in legislation.  I would be up to working on this with people who want the law changed, and have just recently started to talk with people about it.  By the way, my co-worker pays $8/mo now. 




 Do you re-register for the general election? 




 Here comes our corporate court! 




 Important point. 




 And they have a history at stopping at nothing to get what they want. 




 I still love his movies, particularly the funny ones. 




 Good luck!  It's my 40th, and it's hard to believe I am this old! 




 Beautiful! 




 You can do white boards too - like you would see in a corporate office. 




 You can buy blackboard paint that works the same way. 




 It's fun.  Has a lighted canapy over several blocks.  I hear there is a zip line now.  The strip is more spread out. 














 Didn't Fox buy the History Channel a few years back?  That should be reason enough. 




 I would agree, but they stopped the craziness of the tea party house of the last few years.  TG for the Senate. 




 They treat their employees well.  I spoke with one guy who worked for Costco, left to go into the military.  When he returned, they rehired him,  but kept his pay and seniority as if he had been with them the whole time. 




 I think National Geographic gives grants too. 




 Conspicuous consumption, but beautiful anyway 




 When I was young, we used to take the turn at Glendale going north (off the highway heading to the Valley of Fire and Moapa), and would go to Warm Springs.  In those days, they had three swimming pools open to the public.  I haven't been there in almost 30 years now, and the last time I saw it, one was privately owned, and the other two pools were empty.  I'm not sure what it is like today, but it looks like it is a wildlife area now.
http://www.snwa.com/env/wsna.html
There are petroglyphs at the Valley of Fire. 




 Birthers. 




 Great idea! 




 I typed pubic instead of publc in a newsletter.  Used respectfully rather than respectively in a term paper.  I've done a few more, but these are the most memorable. 




 I missed that, but like it. 









 Management ought to go to jail. 




 It's Thom Hartmann who has a daily tv and radio show. 




 I thought it was a great presentation.  I posted it to economics also. 




 Interesting.   




 Good news! 




 9 and 1/2 weeks.  Loved the movie.  The book was sick and basically, just trash. 




 I wish the workers could take over the company. 
























 I haven't been to BA, but have friends who used to go to Drink Liberally there...http://www.drinkingliberally.com.ar/ 




 They decided on the partisanship the day Obama was inaugurated. 




 Move-0n has the software.  I used it a few years ago in my precinct.  Knew who was registered, who voted daily in early voting so they could be contacted to ensure that they turned out. 









 IrishJoe is right.  http://www.reddit.com/tb/12x9rg 




 It may be 10 years until we win the state houses and then can do our own gerrymandering after the next census. 




 I've never related to the South, but I thought the article was well-developed, sensitive.  I think many older white men have seen the threat of losing their position in society also - with the rise of women in the workforce.  Obama could have appealed to them through populism, but I'm not sure they could accept it.  Thanks for the post. 









 Sleezy. 




 Long live Nate! 




 Yeah, can you imagine the House voting for it? 




 I think I would rather eat than look towards the future.  duh. 




 I received a mailing from the "Catholic Association" yesterday urging me to vote for Romney.  The flyer had 6 thumbs up for Romney, 8 thumbs down for Obama.  I'm not Catholic, but am offended. 




 What happened to those campaign emails they were supposed to release a week or so again? 




 Right. 




 Not this bad, but I noticed it twice in the 70's.  First, the Viet Nam war created a huge divide among the young and the old.  Second, I went to a meeting at the Health Department to promote my grant for a community health center.  The room was packed.  I thought the people there were to comment on my half million dollar grant.  No, they were there to speak against a $10,000 family planning grant.   I was stunned.  I also thought Watergate would end it because it seemed so bipartisan, but it didn't, only made it worse. 




 Nice. 




 Too much work and organization. 




 Will you ever hear this on tv? 




 Good for you!  And welcome to the world of sane voters. 




 http://nvdemselectionnight.eventbrite.com/#
This is the link to the Dems get-together.  It's usually pretty busy.   




 Republicans always get caught doing that they complain most about - I'm thinking about Larry Craig.  LOL. 




 There was also a related article about less work and increasing inequality - a digital Athens.  I think the real question is how do we get income to people who cannot find jobs due to automation. 









 Watch the movie "Same Time Next Year".  Our society is so screwed.  Why can't she love two people at the same time - in different ways.  Enjoy and try to get to the place where you can enjoy your time together, knowing it may never be the way you originally envisioned it. 




 I wrote grants for 25 yrs, but it's been about 15 yrs now, so not sure how much things have changed.  Federal grant mgmt offices used to like my proposals because I followed the instructions.  Lots of grant writers don't.   Look at the RFP (request for proposals).  If you know interest groups involved in the projects, ask them if they have any sample proposals to use as guidelines.   Funders generally tell you what they are looking for - and what information they want from you.  I used to joke that it was a term paper with a budget.  You want to try to make it interesting too; don't make it too dry. 




 How about deep fried twinkies.  Haven't tried them, but hear they are pretty good.
 




 I met a photographer from NG.  He had written at least one book about his career there, which I gave as a gift, so unfortunately, I can't remember his name!  He started out there as an intern and was eventually hired by them. It's been a few years now, but he had worked for them for over 25 yrs.  I think he also had 2-3 covers on the mag.  Sorry, this is the best I can offer! 




 I'll never believe it. 




 One of the Naked Gun movies. 




 Beautiful! 




 Amen. 









 I don't have children, but don't mind paying taxes for schools because it benefits our society as a whole. 




 Except you could not get one vote from any one of them for any bill. 




 I love Bill Clinton but he did a lot wrong because he caved to republicans on important values.  We got the terrible trade bills like NAFTA that offered no worker protection, he signed the bill to get rid of Glass Steagal which paved the way for the crash.  And remember how they harrassed him to death with the special prosecutor, finally impeaching him.  Now, they act like he was a saint. 




 The only way to get a long with the current republican congress is to give them everything they want.  Remember during the republican presidential debate that the question was asked "Would you take a 10 to 1 cut in spending vs tax increase" and they all said they would not accept that.  You can't work with people who don't want to work with you. 




 There are structural problems in the Senate.  You need 60 votes to get anything through.  With  Ted Kennedy being  sick and then dying, the Senate didln't have 60 votes.  Pelosi passed a ton of bills in the House that couldn't pass in the Senate.  Dems are not like Republicans.  It's hard to get 60 Dems in the Senate to agree on anything.  I do think Campaign Finance reform would help.  Both parties are too tied to fundraising, lobbiests. 




 Yeah, and now they love him. 




 I'm envious. 




 He's not on the ballot for another 4 years (Senators have 6-yr terms, not 2-years as in the House).  The Senate has some flaws that make it impossible to govern without a 60 vote majority.  Getting rid of incumbents won't help.  They have learned that term limits only turn government over to lobbiests and bearucrats because they are then the only people who understand the system.  This is not what you want.  You may want to work to change the rules.  I saw an article once (wish I could find it) that it is also possible for the House to be highjacked by a small minority (like the tea party) so the House is unable to get anything done either.  Ideally, you want majorities of the same party in both houses to be able to get things done.   




 I'm sure that is why.  




 You have to vote partisan in Nevada because it is a swing state.  You can afford to give your vote for a real progressive in California! 




 I wish there were more Bernies. 




 I know how you feel.  But trust me, things can get worse.  Many of us saw this with Bush, and look where we are at today.  If you don't live in a battleground state, go for it.  I love most of the small candidates, including Jill Stein and Rocky Anderson.  If you live in a battleground state, you have no choice but to vote for Obama.  It's too critical not to. 




 Romney didn't run for a second term because he had a 31% favorability rating.  Additionally, he vetoed 800 bills passed by the Massachusetts legislature.  I didn't link the stats, but you can find them fairly easily by googling them.  So much for bipartisanship.  We have to end this plutocracy.  Our only hope we change the constitution or find a way out of this pay for play system, and save the middle class.  Otherwise, we will all lose. 




 I thought this was a great interview.  I wish there was more interest here about it.  We have to come up with some new ways of talking about this issue - and how we are going to address the future. 




 I wish they would do something about the Romney connection to voting machines also. 




 And the rant on over-regulation.  What jerks. 




 Sorry, I'm in Las Vegas.  Uncomfortable now using more water too.  My pool has been empty now for 5 years - looks pretty bad though. 




 Not a bad idea! 
























 Nice! 




 I want to do this. 




 I am continually stunned with these folks. 




 Or the anthrax attack. 




 I'd probably buy one of those around-the-world cruises. 




 And still he gets no respect (except from us libs who love him) 




 I was thinking about that yesterday. I would try them! 




 Life is stranger than fiction. 




 There is a rv rental business on Sahara between i15 and the strip where you can rent tent trailers reasonably also, although I have'nt checked them out in a few years. 




 Isn't that a little elitist? 




 I was thinking about this yesterday.  It would definitely get me excited.  Not sure if she could win though.... 









 I think a survey was done one and the Turkish leader Ataturk was ranked highest of all leaders. Sorry, I don't have the time to find it now. 









 I always wonder if he is playing checkers or chess.  I still don't know, but it could screw us if the Republicans finally played ball.  Also, I wish he would use the stage to change the conversation.  No talk about jobs, only the lousy deficit.  No help for Main Street, only more help for Wall Street. 




 Why would you start a war if nobody came? 




 He doesn't seem to learn. 




 I love it. 














 Sick. 




 



The Urban League has a job program for ex-felons.  They also have a list of employers who will hire them.   There are a group of hotels also, but you have to be honest with them upfront.  Jobs are tough for everyone here now though.





 




 Wait until they are all monopolies, and no one has money or capital to compete. 




 That's because you have never listened to her.  She KNOWS what she is talking about.  She is not a wingbat. 




 Wow.   I like the sound of that! 




 Yeah, but military spending doubled after 9-11.  It needs to be cut even more.  We don't need 80+ bases around the world.  We don't need to outspend the rest of the world combined. 




 Apathy. 




 Taxes on the rich were 90% in the fifties, and corporations paid most of the taxes. 









 It happened to me too.  I'm trying to get in the spirit again, but I'm just so tired.  Hopefully, I'll come around soon, and not let it happen again. 




 Now, if they all would vote. 




 I feel like I had this my whole life, but don't consider myself gifted.  As an existentialist, however, I just realized that in the end it doesn't matter anyway. 




 The other person fired during the war was Bill Maher. 



















 Good for you for asking.  I felt like I couldn't look at another salad or another chicken.   I fell off the wagon and gained my weight back, stopped working out, and feel miserable. 




 He is absolutely correct.  The amount of Social Security one receives is also based on your top 30 yrs of earnings - and you need to earn $20,000/year substanial earnings for the year to count more than $0.  I see too many jobs paying minimum wage to $12/hr which will never help to contribute enough earnings for social security.  And comments here are right too, we can never get enough people out to protest.  We have to find a way to get the do-nothings out of congress and keep the good ones. I'm so frustrated too for people - yet alone myself. 




 Sorry about the spelling. 




 And through the constitution, they are structurally given what they need to survive. 









 We have a spending problem. 









 Or too lazy to look up and post.  Thanks from a lazy one. 




 I see people take out of their 401(k)s all the time.  And even when they don't, they can't save enough to carry them through their retirement.  Do you want them to die on the streets? 




 And a good place to harvest profits. 




 I agree.  I also know a Sandy Duncan.  LOL. 




 No, I'm sorry about your mom (my dad died at 48), but that's also how it supports people that live longer too.  I don't believe social security is broken.  It's the best thing we have going.  I'm looking forward to it, and you will be grateful it will be there for you.  It's just that Wall Street wants very badly to get their hands on it. 




 I looked for his website, but it looks like it doesn't exist anymore.  He had a packet of handouts you could buy also for about $15.  I had planned to order it, but never got around to it.  Our universities have been hit so hard that anything out of the ordinary in no longer there.  Sorry!  He did spend a lot of time talking about Mexico, where Americans could go, health care, taxes, etc.  He did cover other areas that are popular with potential expats.  I still think there is a market, but don't know where he went! 




 At least not soon enough for me.  I'm so tired of the tyranny of the minority we know as the right-wing. 














 Good luck.  I'm pulling for you too.  Just wish I had something offer. 




 It's an 8 hr drive from Las Vegas to Reno, and the road is long and boring.  There used to be a billboard on the highway in the fifties that just said "Ain't this monotomous?"  I remember it as a child, and only wish I had a photo of it today.  Your comment reminded me of it. 









 You did good work, and while they were not in my City, I was aware of and supported your efforts - for 30+ yrs.  I also hated that Dems were such wimps. 














 I thought the sequestration would fail due to the lobbyists, so I don't know.  It is interesting though. 




 People invested in stocks until the bubble burst and they lost their investment.  So that is when they started investing heavily in the real estate market (at least there was something real sitting there), and then the housing bubble burst and people lost the value of that also.  SS is the only option that isn't a ripoff.  It's an insurance plan that you pay for 50 years of your labor. 




 I know some people who have used granite tiles - much less expensive - and can be a diy project.   




 I've seen it.  People who think they are deserving, but no one else is. 




 I attended a one-night class through the continuing education program of our university.  I think it cost $59.   The guy who gave it travels through the west coast doing it at different universities.  So, yes, it is possible. 




 That's a better comment than mine. 




 Bradley Manning was trying to OPEN up government and start a conversation.  The Tea Party is trying to CLOSE down the big bad government. 




 I'm not sure if it was the Pew study, but there was a study of who was the Tea Party, and it was discovered that it was the religious right. 




 Good point.  They also met on the day of Obama's first inauguration and decided to fight him on everything.  And they have!  Even their own recommendations for appointments have been fillabustered! 




 I see jobs frequently on usajobs.com for positions for the military. 




 I don't understand the Republican's push for these drug testing bills.  They did it in Florida and less than 3% of the population showed any drugs, less use than the general public.  Somebody has got to be getting big contracts - why else?  It's a huge waste of money.  Somebody, enlighten me. 




 That happens to all of us - it's not just because of our views. 




 You might want to go to PBS and watch the PBS Frontline on 401(k)s.  Nebraska did a 20 yr study and decided that people could never retire on them. 




 I can't believe that I found it.  I knew him through his manager who was named Red (It's been too many years now!)  Saw him box at the Showboat.  I remember the infamous Howard Cossell talking on tv on what a strong boxer he was.  He didn't have the move Ali had, but he could hit.  
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._T._Gordon 




 Yeah, but they will blame it on Obama. 




 I hope to visit someday. 




 I really like Ellison. 




 Republicans don't care about budgets.  They just want to dismantle the social safety net. 




 I thought the bristle cone pine in California was the oldest tree.

 He is a part of everything bad that has happened to us in the past 20 years.  His wife was on the Enron Board.  He was the main proponent of ending Glass-Steigel.  The sequester too???? 














 Actually, S.T.Gregg was a Las Vegas boxing champion in the late 70's.  He won the cruiser weight championship. 




 Beale cypher has never been broken, I believe. 









 My friend who has designed over 100 beautiful houses hasn't had a job since the economy crashed. 




 I'd buy from you! 




 Reagan was voted very low in one of these surveys shortly after his administration ended.  Big money came to the rescue to change history. 




 I believe the House just got pay raises too.  Sleazy people. 




 I've read this before.  What I want to know is if there is a hereditary or a DNA basis.  I wonder if it could be based on ancestry. 




 He earned it. 




 They are already on the dole. 




 Right.  Government is subsidizing low wages with foods stamps, medical and TANF, not to mention housing, utility allowance, etc. 









  Congress allows it.  




 Lol. Busted. 




 You are right.   There was a study somewhere that confirmed this.  I wish I had the link to place here. 




 They are actually the religious right, but I think most republicans believe  the same things.  The only ones that don't are the 1% who only believe in the bottom line who have been funding the republicans all along. 




 Thom Hartmann says it the "two Santa Claus theory" and says it was planned that way. 




   He is my favorite person alive.  I'll probably be at work however and will probably miss it. 




 I put $3000 in a 401K in 1990.  It is still worth $3000 today.  For those of you who who don't believe the article, I urge to to check out the Frontline video on PBS.  Nebraska conducted a 20 yr study and came out with the same conclusion.  People will not be able to retire on a 401(k). And Social Security is not a ponzi scheme because we should not run out of workers investing the system.  A ponzi scheme runs out of investors.  I do worry about there being a lack of work permanently as a way to distribute money throughout the society.  If we do not have work, we will all lose and the whole economy will fail, not just social security.  I've spent a lot of years looking at this. 




 I thought they were trying to get rid of "stupid". 




 Work has been a way to distribute money or wealth.  With computerization, there will be less jobs in the future.  We have to find another way to distribute money so people can live.  Not everyone can be an entrepreneur either. 




 I do worry about the "substantial earnings" amount.  It is about $20,000 per year now, and there are too many low-wage earners that are employed 20-30 hrs/week.   




 Privatized, then stolen by Wall Street. 




 Center-left yes. 




 Interesting. 




 Not really.  Nobody pays me to read and respond to reddit articles. 




 You have my vote. 




 We have heard of people being paid to be bloggers on the right.  I see some of the reddit comments and wonder "hmmm, I wonder if this person is paid to say that".  Am I the only person that wonders about this? 




 My husband's uncle told him that it would never be there for him. Well,  my husband worked for 50 years, and guess what, he is receiving it. 




 In a ponzi scheme, you run out of investors.  Social Security has a ready stream of investors (workers paying in to the sytem) and people who either receiving or dead. 




 Wall Street wants thier hands on all that money. 




 I'm impressed about your investments. 




 
i got one today! 




 reddit. 




 If they really stopped the vote changing by the republicans during the last election, I love them.  Wish it could be verified however. 




 Interesting.  I don't remember cuts to medicaid, food stamps, but I remember him cutting lots of people from SSI.  And it didn't seem like there was much said about it.  It was just done.  I would be interested in reading about that.  Also, it was overnight that people started appearing pushing grocery carts around.   I had never seen it before. 




 You could do it with foundation support. 




 I think it is remarkable, and a way of organizing workers which seems almost impossible these days.  I think it will probably be out of business once Obamacare is implemented however.  Will have to see. 




 Typing. 




 
I would like to spend one summer there. 




 AFSCME, the Public employee union. 









 A  lot less jobs due to robots. 




 Sunday night: Inaugural Party
http://inaugurationvegas.eventbrite.com/#

 




 I think it's good.  Maybe he can bring sense to these folks. 




 I've only dreamed about it... 




 I'm a 63 yr old female and never had children by choice.  I've also been married for 40 yrs.  I like quiet time, and I'm amazed at people that do have children and manage to accomplish so much in thier lives.  In many ways, I've done very little other than work.  I only regret not having children when I think about my husband and how he might have liked it and if it would have changed his life.  He accepted it however, and now says the world has enough children.  I also have a male high school friend who never had children and regrets it very much.  He would still like to have children. 




 I like it. 




 Yes, but that was after years of screaming about the debt.  Remember the debt clock in NYC?  It stopped moving. 




 I didn't read the article, but the headline is ridiculous.  Republicans screamed like crazy during the Clinton years also.  Just not during the Bushes or Reagan years when the debt was building.  Thom Hartmann believes it is a strategy called the "Two Santa Theory".  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Wanniski 




 This guy is sick. 




 Possibly Clark County Social Services. 









 I'm sorry I didn't go to summer school and graduate early, and I'm sorry I didn't apply myself more in college.  I thought it was just like high school l- floated through it.   




 There was an article on reddit recently where mothers in the Appalachia were women were keeping their children from learning to read so that they could claim they were disabled and eligible for social security disability.  If true, these stories break my heart. 




 Age of Aquarius? 




 He is quickly becoming one of my favorite congress member!  Republicans are not necessarily in favor of cutting the deficit.  They just don't like social programs that might help someone else.  They will always support private industry or military contractors. 




 
yikes. 




 I can't wait! 




 Let's only hope.  Remember, they still have the governorship and control of 30 state legislatures.  This has to end too. 




 Thanks for posting the link,  Sometimes we forget how good we have it! 




 Why are they wrong on EVERY issue? 




 I actually think in the end that the ACC is a support to business, like SNAP or Food Stamps helps farmers as much as people. 

























































































 I've written over 100 grant applications.  I used to call them term papers with a budget.  I don't know about Canada however.  Most agencies have their own guidelines and format that you can follow.  My experience is not recent, however, so I'm not sure where the RFPs (request for proposals) are posted these days.  Contact the agency that might cover the area you are interested in developing.  Ask them! 




 What's new? 




 Good comment.
 




 I believe these businesses were paying higher wages when Clinton was President because there was not enough supply of low-wage workers. 









 She works for me. 




 It would be 50 years or more before another bill would be done.  Dems have been trying to do this since Roosevelt. 




 They have to do SOMETHING.  They don't know how to govern, but they need to fill the schedule. 














 What is it with these folks?  They are crazy, unprincipaled. 














 Democrats don't hate Obama.   They actually like him but are disappointed that he hasn't taken on the system more. 














 That's how it was then too.  Only Woodward and Bernstein were reporting on it, and even then, news was thin prior to the 72 election.  It only started coming out AFTER he was reelected. 




 Seriously, I have wondered about that for years. 




 I threw up in someone's car once.   I wanted to apologize the next day, but couldn't remember who was there.  Never found out, and no one every mentioned it to me. 




 I was watching c-span and was shocked to hear him quote something he must have heard from Fox News - and it was wrong!  If you are not going to use the constitution, at least use facts! 




 I knew someone who used to do it, and got a new car every year.  She was very methodical and followed up regularly with her clients. 




 It means its time to tax the rich.
 




 I agree! 









 I didn't look at the article but worked as a employment counselor in a poor neighbors before. Only jobs at that time were mom and pop businesses, poor transportation, and the cost of bus fares and time it takes to getting anywhere.  I used to ask people their priority - close to home or higher hourly pay. Most preferred closer to home due to time. 




 I picked one up once decades ago.  He was carrying a large paper sack.  When he got out of the car, he reached in the bag and gave me a plastic baggie filled with grass.  I don't give strangers rides anymore, but it was a great memory. 




  I was taught in kinergarden to look both wars before I walk. People don't do that anymore. They feel like they own the road. It is scary nonetheless for everyone. 




 My grandfather worked for Great Northern Railroad for 50 years. And yikes, I was born in Seattle a year after this photo was taken... 




 This happened in Nevada too.  They didn't press charges against the company or the  employees. 














 We fought a war over state's rights too, and won. I keep hearing about state's rights. I'm cheating though. Didn't read the article. 














 So gross. 




 Let the public pay the salaries of employees? 




 I realized it, but it was too late to edit... I'm embarassed also.  Nothing worse than getting someone's name wrong. 









 Also, I remember the dirty look he gave Nancy Pelosi - Don't remember now if it was for illegal activities of GWB or the war, but it was searing, and I think caused her to change her answer. 




 If you don't have insurance, try health centers of Nevada. Located at Cambridge Comm Center. I haven't been there, but started a similar clinic years ago.   It is nonprofit, fed subsidized. They will accept insurance however. Very close to unlv. 









 Looks better than the door that I use as a top. 




 It is past time that we admit it:  The government subsidizes wages of large corporations through SNAP, medicaid and other forms of services.  We say it is for the poor, but it corporations paid a decent wage, then these services wouldn't be needed. 














 I would probably take the round the world cruise that takes a year or so and stops if every major port. 




 Don't you love how these legislatures care for their own people. Sounds like a voter registration opportunity to me. 









 Yes. I'm now 64 yrs old. Even though I have been married for over 40 yrs, I never had a friend with similar interests, including my spouse. Would like to plan, design and work on projects that could be fun and meaningful.  I have ideas at different times, but everyone is just busy doing their own thing and isn't interested.  









 I saw it a few years ago on tv.  Interesting. 




 I agree with that! 









 Now, if all these folks would register and ensure to vote..... 




 Actually, if they had recounted, Gore would have won Florida.  The Supreme Court stopped the vote.  Gore also had more votes nationwide, but lost due to delegate count (excluding Florida).  




 A can of tuna, a can of mushroom soup and cooked noodles topped with shreaded cheese and baked. 




 I'm just a soul whose intentions are good. oh lord please don't let me be misunderstood by Eric Burton I believe, or maybe Still haven't found what I'm looking for by Bono. 
























 My city had two bond issues one year on the ballot, one for schools and one for prisons.  I was shocked when the prison bond went through but schools failed. How short-sighted and sad.@ 




 That's why they call it conservative Sundays regarding tv. 




 Wow.  I heard they liked beer.  I put some out and only one showed up.  Never heard about watermelon. 




 Didn't they get retroactive immunity for this once already????? 




 I think it was a tv show hosted by Alfred Hitchcock.  A boy grew mushrooms in his basement.   They ended up taking over his body.  Very scary.  




 Conspicuous consumption. 




 Thank you. 




 The head of the IRS is a republican appointed by Bush.  You could built a good conspiracy theory here! 




 I just wish it was more consumer oriented. 









 Take me wlth you.
 




 Me too.
 




 Zion is about 3 hrs out of Las Vegas.  The Zions Narrows is an 18 mile hike down the river.  While I've walked a ways up the river, the full hike is on my short list.  It is beautiful there.  They only allow so many people in the canyon however, so you need to make arrangements first with the Park. 




 Where is this? 




 If those 1.5 million residents vote, the state will turn blue.  It's heading that way anyway. 




 Fun. 




 Sick huh? 




 Desert Bloom.  Although there are photos of old Vegas including LVHS, I heard it wasn't filmed here.  And no one mentions Viva Las Vegas! 









 I hate to tell you, but most people want to work.  It's hard for a lot of people to work when it's not enough to pay their rent. 




 Not really. It just told them what they want to believe, even if wrong. 









 After a few years, I decided to get serious, and I got to be pretty good.  I practiced with set shots including spot shots, draw and follow.  The other key for me was to be able to see through three shots, so I played a lot of three-ball just trying to make three shots in a row.  If you can continually make three shots, you can run out. 




 That looks pretty good!  Wish I had one right now. 




 I feel the same way.   




 For those of you who like this, there is a facebook site: Las Vegas, The Good ol' days.  A lot of old timers put photos, film and other comments on the page. 




 NPR did a piece on this, and some of the songs were hilarious.  A bunch of people played the Rightious Bros "You've Lost that Loving Feeling" at their wedding! 




 Me too. 




 Also, public housing stopped being built and HUD started contracting out Section 8 housing to investors owning multiple houses.  I remember seeing a story in my town where a man was renting a house to his girlfriend, and HUD was paying the rent. 




 Not far enough, 




 The initial story showed a homeless guy being sent to Sacramento, CA.  In the follow-up story, it showed him now living with his sister in Sacramento which is a better option than staying in a mental health hospital.  He literally was sent to family. 




 Not really. 




 I know, a California for-profit hospital. 




 wow. 




 Yes, and state employees have taken about a 20% pay and benefit cut in the last 4 years, and it doesn't look like the legislature will do anything to help it in the next two years.  State employees were already lowest on the totem pole with city and county workers. 




 I watched Anthony Bourdain there last night on CNN. I've been dreaming about it all day.  Then I see your photos.  Great pics! 




 Good for this boy.  When I saw the article title, I was hoping it was the young boy was was abducted by the Chinese as he was identified as being the next Dali Lama.   




 Partly it's like crying wolf.  We're tired of hearing of their continual outrage over something - anything.  I think Obama's right on this one:  there is no there there. 




 The NAACP was singled out; I just didn't hear about it until this week. 




 You're right.  It drives me crazy.  I've talked with some of these folks.  They are entitled, it's the other ones who are scamming the system.  It's insane. 




 The intent was different too.  Nixon saw it as a way to get rid of the bureaucracy. 




 You make good points and I do worry about Dems a lot too.  But,  the parties are not comparable in craziness.   




 I would just tax the Walton family since they earn 40% of all income in a year in the US.  Taxes used to be 90% in the US in the 50's ; 83% in England in 1980.  If it keeps going the way it is, no one will have any income at all to shop at Wal-Mart. 




 Thank you for your thoughtful contribution.  I saw a book on c-span today that was addressing these very issues...http://www.truth-out.org/article/item/1388:gar-alperovitz-the-prehistory-of-the-next-possible-progressive-era
This is a Truthout article on his book and thoughts about the subject.  He was talking today about coops, but he said long term we need to define the type of democracy we want. 




 No necessarily, but you you would have the freedom to find your purpose without having to worry about the necessities.   




 Exactly.  I don't think we have a choice. 




 There is an old town in Nevada also -  St. Thomas - that was covered during the filling of Lake Mead that is now being exposed. 




 Depressing huh? 




 That was what Cheney said. 




 When did you win your Nobel prize for economics? 




 It seems hopeless. 




 Good summation. 




 I can't believe she is still around and given credibility by the right.  I see her occassionally on C-Span.  Amazing. 




 You are not paying close enough attention.  I rarely hear Dems make the crazy type of statements that you hear 10 times a day from Republicans.  Check this article out that I just saw on reddit http://www.reddit.com/tb/1dz4tl
or listen to Rachel on MSNBC.  Is she biased?  You bet.  But she can back her stuff up with facts. 




 I just made a comment on another article about thier craziness is that we need to treat them as a cult and de-program them.  Then I see this article.... 




 We need to start treating them as a cult, and that they members need to be de-programed. 




 It's not too new.  It was proposed by Nixon. 




 I wish we could vote these guys out, but we can't seem to do it.
 




 I like Bugliosi, but Thom Hartmann has a good book which makes a strong case for the mafia. 









 Close.  Charleston and Main.  I don't remember anyone swimming it it though!  Great photo. 




 I've never heard of this university. 









 Thank you for your thoughtful response.  We read too little of this. 




 This link needs to be made in the science subreddit.  People there might be as interested as us. 




 I wasn't making reference to you. 




 I'm at the same place you are.  It's tough to live like this.  I don't know how people do it.  We can't give up though. 




 Wow. Thanks for the post. And since I missed the previous post, I'm glad you did this. 




 http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2013/04/gut-microbiome-bacteria-weight-loss?page=1 
























 I wish I could afford to travel to all of them.  Just beautiful. 




 This was the year my parents moved to Las Vegas.  May check out the Google Earth mentioned in the comments below.  So many memories. 









 Just not sure where I should post this.. 














 Great looking couple!  They look like they should have been cast on the Mod Squad. 




 Dream on.  I have a 401(k) that is 30 yrs old and is worth about the same as it was then. 




 Their deal will cost me about $400/mo.  I remember I was not working and had to pay taxes on my unemployment.  That also happened during that period. 




 And sat on the Wal-Mart Board of Directors for 12 yrs. 









 I hope Dems do not get passive, and actively pursue voter registration of these folks. 














 They actually paid more -- 110%. 




 Gret comments. 




 That was beautiful. 




 You will spend a lot of time driving between sites.  You may want Tito look at travel times. 




 You're missing all the wonderful parks in Utah!  Check them out. 




 Nice. 









 We would have two more crazy senators. 




 Wow.  Just having Bernie tour the country would be great. 




 Me too.  If you go back further, you have FDR which I think was our best president ever.  Would have liked to live during his tenure.  My grandparents loved him. 




 I loved to listen to Clinton talk (yes, he is the explainer in chief), but he was not our best president.  The trade bills hurt Americans, except for CEOs on international companies and repealed the Glass-Stegall Act.  That being said, unemployment was the lowest I've seen in my lifetime. 




 They turned off the debt clock in New York City because it was going backwards.  They didn't want to pay bonds off before they were due, so essentially we did have a surplus. 




 They may shift the burden to state governments, but usually with the money.  It's called block grants to the states, and states decide thier priorities. 




 Most local governments are paying for medical care now at County Hospitals that can't turn people away.   




 Medicare, Part E - E for everybody. 




 Thank you! 




  I can't find my saved items on Reddit anymore.   




 I just learned that.  I've been upset over the fact that I didn't go see it when I was at Black Rock. 




 For sure. 




 I think small businesses were better off before the large corporations took over.
 




 Based on your opinion.  I'm not sure how you could factually document why smaller government is better.   




 I'm not sure how good it is now, but it used to be that veteran's had the highest satisfaction with their health care. 




 I think Section 8 was to get federal money to private investors who could buy housing/apartments and get their mortgage paid by the government.  Section 8 made a lot of people money.  They was also a huge HUD scandal during the Reagan administration that cost us billions.  You don't hear anything about it today. 




 I used to think that the South would only vote for a republican OR another southerner, i.e. Jimmy Carter or Bill Clinton.   They turned against both of them though.  Jimmy Carter, a real evangelical! 




 Time to revisit the "Two Santa Theory" of republican tactics:
http://www.democraticunderground.com/10021632181 









 Single payer would make sense.  Some parts of the economy should be for the public good, not private profit. 




 I also wonder how much they are paid to be trolls. 




 Seniors use to vote Democratic because they were grateful for medicare and social security.  I can't believe how they have changed.  It's got to be fear. 




 I have a legend I would like to know if it was true or not.  My parents told me that prior to central air conditioning, hotels bought cooks cases of beer to cool off during hot desert summers in Las Vegas. 




 She is a real artist.  Very creative and beautiful. 




 I think you are right. They should pay a price, and they were heading towards bringing down the world economy - because they didn't like a law. 




 And how much did it cost? 









 Yeah! 









 Many employers USED to think of their employees as family, and care about their wellbeing.  Now, it is only the bottom line.  I think alot has to do with local, small businesses vs corporations who don't know or care about the employee. 




 http://www.weather.com/news/science/nature/worlds-most-amazing-places-fly-geyser-20130617 




 He was active during Clinton's impeachment. 




 I think you are right. 




 How about a war started on false premise, or the econy collapse. Those two items should be enough. 




 I read a book recently that said World War I didn't end until the fall of the Berlin wall in the 1980's. I think this guy has it right. They are still fighting over state's rights which should have been settled in the Civil War. 









 Right now, Matt Taibbi. 




 I saw Ted Cruz's father on C-Span and all I can say is that I understand why Cruz is the way he is. His father is an absolute lunatic. 




 There is a great book published during the Bush years called "The Banana Republicans".
http://www.amazon.com/Banana-Republicans-Turning-America-One-Party/dp/1585423424 




 You are absolutely correct.  There may be only 30 who consider themselves moderate.  There is plenty of documentation to back this up. 




 I love their sense of humor.  That's great. 




 Unfortunately, you are correct. 




 My favorite politician EVER. 









 I kind of like that idea. 




 Religion is based on faith, not reason. 




 There are a lot of wonderful Christians who do help.  I know them!  But as a group, they are capable of bringing the whole system down - like in the debt ceiling confrontation happening in congress, or the lack of belief in science and the denial of global warming, which will create untold horrors.  And, in the end, do we really want children to go hungry? 




 There are probably programs at your county that will pay for a year of your schooling for a year of paid service.  You should talk with the counselor at your college. 


 




 The above post is a repost from politics to Vegas.  Let's hope this guy isn't right. 









 It wasn't a filibuster; it only looked like one on tv. 




 I wondered about that too. 




 There are sure a lot of right wing folks on reddit.  




 

















I guess you never read John Locke.



 




 They tried to in Wisconsin, and lost.

 I'm just sick thinking how seniors are now mostly republicans. Dens brought them social security and medicare. They used to know this and support dems. 




 FDR was amazing. Can't believe he hasn't been mentioned. 














 I'd like to see a test showing how you could change people's minds about a social issue in the short run.  
























 Exactly.  He was awfully quiet during the Bush years. 




 That's the best definition I ever read.  I would post it if it was in an article format!  Thank you. 




 Reading the comments, I can't believe how many redditors are republican.  Are they ALL on reddit? 




 We don't need to cut the size of government.  We need to go back to collecting taxes from those who can afford it.  A big country needs a big government to do big things. 




 So, we stop educating children???? 









 Many of the rich don't want to pay taxes to support it.  




 I could only wish. 




 I want to be a Millennial. 




 He needs to be fired. 




 I've been saying this forever:  We need to look at a new way to distribute money rather than basing it on work - guaranteed annual income?  I don't see another way for the long term. 









 Good article.  I watched Elizabeth Drew religiously on PBS during the Watergate hearings.  
 




 I want to sign and send it out to all my friends, but I can't get in to the petition!  Will try later today and see if it is the same. 




 You did great. 




 Plentiful jobs at low wages. 




 Thanks for the posting.  I was wondering where the other bridges were located. 




 WHAT: Rally for Nevada Jobs

WHEN: Clark County Commission Meeting, Tuesday, September 3rd, 9:00am

WHERE: Clark County Commission Building, 500 S. Grand Central Parkway, Commission Chambers

 Interesting concept.  I used to think they had not been in control of  congress for so long, they didn't know how to govern. When they did control Congress, they did a terrible job on it. I still believe that they don't know how to govern, but how we got there may be different than what I thought.  We do have a problem with the constitution and giving them more representation than they deserve.  I'm not sure we will ever get them out. 




 A few years ago (when I was 60), I started dieting - I did my own diet of low carb, low calorie.  It was tough.  It took forever for the weight to start to drop.  I started walking - a little more each day - and did leg presses at the gym to get my strength up.  It took a while, but easily got up to 3 miles/day x 6 days/week - 20 minute mile - about 1 hr/day.  I only lost 30 lbs, but my pant size went from a 20 to a 12.  I stopped and it all came back very quickly.  I'm having trouble getting motivated again, but I know it works.  My doctor was really pleased with my vitals. 




 I hate thiefs. 




 Interesting take.  You may be right. 




 I haven't been to Burning Man, but I've been to the location (Black Rock Desert) for other activities.  It is awesome.  It is so big that when you are on the desert, you can see the curvature of the earth on the horizon.  It would be easy to get lost too. 









 You are right.  Nevada ranks #1 in the inability for people to find full time jobs. 




 This is the second qilded age. 




 I think that is the rule in Las Vegas.  Some restaurants pay like 2.00/hr expecting their employees to make it up in tips.  I think it sucks.
 




 That's the point.  Lift low-income workers salaries and everyone's rise. 




 Music was great and we felt we could change the world.  We failed unfortunately, but it was a good feeling. 




 I remember those!
 




 I have a friend who started buying electronic cigs from China with about $300.  He has built up his business where he now has 4 stores. 




 Join thousands of fast food workers as part of a nation wide strike to demand better pay and better treatment. Low-wage workers are having a hard time making ends meet while corporations such as McDonalds, Wendys, Burger King and KFC are making billions in profits. Theyre paying poverty wages and keeping the entire economy down.

 There will be strikes in the northwest and downtown Las Vegas from 6 to 11 a.m. on Thursday, August 29th. We will be dividing into two shifts, as we understand most people cannot attend the full day. 

 WHAT: 1st shift
 WHERE: PLAN  Las Vegas, 708 S. 6th Street, Las Vegas, NV 89101
 WHEN: 5 AM

 WHAT: 2nd shift
 WHERE: PLAN  Las Vegas, 708 S. 6th Street, Las Vegas, NV 89101
 WHEN: 9 AM

 For more information on the strikes contact:

 I wonder who has the "in" for contracts to do it. 




 A lot of boomers believed in politics and public service.  Trying to stop the Vietnam war and starting of the Peace Corps. We thought we could change society.  Many changed in the 80's however.  It's too bad that we failed. 




 Thank you for your thoughtful comments.  I couldn't have said them better. 




 Years ago, we had an anti-welfare march in our town with people who think just like you. I was volunteering at our local legal aid office. One of the leaders of this anti-welfare march was there seeking assistance. He had had a heart attack (no insurance), lost his job, then his wife. He was trying to get some help. He regretted his previous stance. The lesson is that we are all one step away from poverty.  I now work at a welfare office.  When jobs were available, we had a lot less clients. People on the whole prefer to work. 




 You direct your anger at the wrong folks. 




 Campaign finance reform. 




 Yes, I wish that Dems would have tackled this issue first when they were in power (rather than health care).   




 It drives me crazy when I hear people say that Republicans freed the slaves.  The Republicans who freed the slaves would all be Democrats today. 














 Everyone should read your response. It was great. 




 Really good point.  I wish I could give you multiple upvotes! 




 I haven't read the article yet, but I wanted to start a co-op in my community.  It is against the law.  Our electric company provides a partial rebate to few homeowners every 2-4 years to have it installed  for outrageous costs. 



















 Little late now, but I go to the dry lake bed headind towards Laughlin. Young just before you get to Boulder City and it is on the right. Next time. 




 People could get paid, and live a higher standard of living. 




 I agree.  Right now, work is just a way to distribute money for people to live.  And how many people are doing jobs that they hate or are not really productive to society. 
























 He is such a good writer. 




 I don't want to discourage you, but unemployment is still really high here and pay is low for a lot of jobs.  You didn't mention what type of job you are interested in.  If you could apply for some jobs, come out on a vacation and interview.  If you get hired, move! 




 Voc-Rehab located in the Job Connect offices should be able to help.  Opportunity Village may have an employment program also although I'm not sure.  I worked at Catholic Charities at one time, and a coworker was in a wheelchair.  You can pretty much do any office job; it's just finding the right employer. 




 I don't think the article mentioned people were going without water to save pensions.  Pensions and health care are getting cut also.  I wish Obama could bail them out. 




 I believe the headline is correct.  The arguments supporting it however would not influence republican beliefs. 




 By the way, I would love Cheney to expound on his quote.   I'm curious about where he developed the thought on this.  I wonder if deficits do matter??  Other than that, he is about the sleaziest elected official I have ever seen. 




 Other than the Bootlegger, I didn't know or recognize any of the other locations shown.  I felt that this was a town I didn't know! 




 But he is right! 




 I have a friend who started with $250 selling vapes at a flea market.  He now has four stores. 




 What is Richard Mellon Scaife doing today?  Is he still living?  It's wierd that the Koch brothers have seemed to take his place. 




 Yes.  She seems to go on forever.....

 Why only for emergencies? 




 I think that is the base income. Everyone earning more than that wouldn't receive anything. 




 Let's get rid of those pesky unionized public employees. 









 It's true.  Can you believe it???? 




 Wasn't  Delta employee-owned at one point? Whatever happened with that? 









 I had just finished the book "Dog Whistle Politics" and it definitely had an effect on how I view the world. I started looking at all issues through this lens and it is amazing how I can see connections I didn't see previously. 




 Agree.
 




 They call themselves independents so they don't have to accept Bush as one of their own. 




 Drives me crazy.  They have to be getting it from their parents. 




 Gives me hope.  




 I agree with you there.  I don't know alot about Soros (and his business dealings), but when I've seen him on tv, he appears to be rational and thoughtful, two traits that I like. 




 I thought the light bulb and the phonograph. 




 Edison invented the light bulb and the phonograph.  He supported direct current (DC) for distribution while his ex-employee Tesla wanted alternate current (AC), a far better system.  Edison was more successful in his lobbying efforts. 




 Sorry.  I don't know what DAE means,  I just think we would have been better off following Tesla rather than Edison. 




 Actually, some studies now show that postponing instant gratification is a major step to escaping poverty.  I think they are talking about getting a high school diploma rather than dropping out. 




 I think this is what we hoped Obama would be. 




 The absurdity of it all.  But drugs are not the answer either. 




 What can we do?  They don't even realize they are voting to cut their own  medicare and social security. 




 Maybe Edison.  




 Trash Flash or Dirt Alert. 









 There should be huge voter registration drives in those states. 




 Why does this not surprise me?
 




 When I was young, I remember seeing photos of the match posted in Goldfield. 









 I think everyone needs the same pieces as you do.  Last time they ran this contest, NO one in Nevada won anything. 




 Didn't Ralph Nader say that only the rich can save us? 




 I think the County has jobs for students.  Henderson Parks and Recreation has jobs for students, so maybe the rest of the public entities (LV, NLV, etc.) probably do also.  If you were 18 and had a WSI (Water Safety Instructor) license, you could probably get hired as a lifeguard by the hotels.  Finally, I would google the Workforce Investment Program in Las Vegas. They have several agencies that have been funded to help youth find employment. 




 My husband's uncle told him when he was young that he would never see social security.  He is receiving it today. 




 You will be grateful for these programs when you turn 65.  I also object to them being called Ponzi schemes.  Ponzi schemes run out of investers which is what causes them to go under.  If we kept the money in a locked box, there would be plenty to go around.  We have a bulge in the number of people using the program during the boomer years, but this was expected and won't last.  The boomers also paid 110% of what was going to be needed!! 




 Might be cheaper than refinishing. 




 It was a shock to me, but young whites voted for Romney. 




 I heard George Soros say the same thing basically before GW won his second term.  He said if GW won, there was something wrong with us.  He is right.  There is.
Drives me crazy.   




 Sounds great to me.  I need more recipes, 




 I work with a woman who believes this, and she will not call herself a republican.  She is an independent.  I would guess she has never not voted republican. 




 I loved it when he made reference to February 30th. 




 Hitler did want to be an artist, didn't he? 




 Have you met with anyone at Job Connect?  They do have a Veteran's representative at their offices.  I know there has been a push to get veteran's employed, but I'm not sure which groups have been promoting employment through job fairs, etc.  The Job Connect office might know.  Good luck. 




 They may have more money than governments now. 




 I think it is still common in certain parts of Utah and Arizona. 









 Thank you for posting this overview.  I'm on many email groups and I get emails every other day to save SS.  I didn't have an overview however and this article put things in perspective.  I wondered many times if Obama was playing chess with the republicans, offering up these (and medicare cuts) knowing the republicans wouldn't take up anything he offered, or if he really believed in cutting.  In any case, it makes me nervous. 




 Try getting  job in Las Vegas hotel in advertising.  Maybe the Hilton would be good, then you might be able to transfer  anywhere else in the world. A master's would be good too.  UNLV, while not a great college, does offer a master's in hotel mgmt.  You could specialize in public relations or something. 




 Don't you love em? 




 Except for the strange vote in Ohio. 




 You answered with exactly what I was going to say. 




 The problem is that they are doing it at the local level now.  The exectutive branch is almost moot at this point.  That's why midterm elections are so important. 




 Didn't Perot win about 25% of the vote.  I liked Anderson too, but Perot would have been a horrible president. 




 Reagan was not popular when he left office.  The right has spent millions of dollars to rehabilitate his image. 




 Thank you for that.  I just finished reading "Dog-Whistle Politics" and I was shocked to learn that Romney won the white youth vote.  If youth are more progressive, it may be due to ethnic demographic changes.  You give me hope, because I've been watching these things for a lot of time, and I believe you are right. 




 Decades ago now, PBS aired a simulation (?) of the Chicago 7 trial using actual transcripts. I never forgot it. 









 Absolutely.  It's also been called the Two Santa Theory.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Wanniski 




 There was also discussion that they didn't want to pay off bonds before they were due. 




 I don't consider Paul a libertarian.  He is also anti-choice. 









 If you have 5-7 friends you play with, try Diplomacy.  Puts Risk to shame.  No dice, no luck in the game. 




 Yes, let's have war and an economy crash again. 




 Unfortunately they are right.  They have effectively stopped anything from happening at the national level.  Now, everything is happening at the state level.  It's just the wrong things. 




 If you think he's bad, wait ....  And if George Bush wasn't enough, you can't believe what Cruz would do. 




 And you can't discuss anything with them reasonably.  I've been there. 




 Most Tea Party members are the Religious Right.  They just rear their ugly heads every decade or so. 




 What a great experience. 




 They forgot to attend the hearing? 




 Good article.  The article should have pointed out the racial makeup of the Tea Party and the Republican Party for that matter.  It is 90 % white.  I think they put every minority they have out front to show that they are inclusive.  LOL.   




 Also, the Tea Party is a resurgence of the John Birch Society. I think that the Koch brothers' father was co-founder of the John Birch Society.  




 You could contract out to hospitals, HMOs or insurance companies for home visits for high risk patients that keep getting admitted, for assessments, review of medications, etc.  You could lower costs, and clients could have a greater health outcome. 




 When I was young, I remember the 8 hr drive from Las Vegas to Reno, which looks a whole lot less boring than your drive.  There was a billboard by the road that simply said "Ain't this monotonous?"  I wish I had a photo of that billboard today. 




 

















White Americans have not voted for a Democratic President since LBJ who said he was afraid he had lost the Democratic vote for a generation when he signed the Civil Rights Act.  Source: Dog Whistle Politics

Sorry for not finding the exact statistics to back it up, but it's in the book.



 




 Good link.
 




 Unfortunately, I think your right.  In the real world, we could show them the light, then register them to vote. 









 Tax breaks for the rich.  http://www.aei-ideas.org/2012/04/why-we-cant-go-back-to-sky-high-1950s-tax-rates/
It was 91% back then.  People were still rich, but there was a smaller gap.   




 I also agree. 




 I agree. 




 Poverty may cause crime; We do need to fix the problem (and I'm sorry for your experience), but cutting food stamps will only exacerbate the problem. 




 I know people from big families (not polygamist), and I'm amazed at how they do it.  Hard work too! 




 I hope you read my response to another comment in this same link.   




 Actually, I think that "Dog Whistle Politics" stated that 96% of Romney's vote came from the white population.  In terms of membership, Yahoo says whites make up 90% of all Republicans.  
http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080619075211AAEZsTi
"Dog Whistle Politics" did say that Romney won the white vote of every age group which surprised me.  I thought youth had become more liberal.

"Dog Whistle.." also reported that the Democrats have not won the white vote for President since 1964 since LBJ was elected.  You may know that when he signed the Civil Rights Act, he predicted that he may have lost the south for the Dems for a generation.

This caused Republicans to develop the Southern Strategy under Nixon. Two Republicans former chairs have apologized for that strategy:

Ken Melman, former chair apologizing for the party using the race card: http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/13/AR2005071302342.html

Michael Steel, former GOP chair apologizing for the party's use of the Southern Strategy:

You know, I'm white and don't like to hear this either, but sometimes the truth is painful.  I really recommend this book. C-Span had an interview with the book's author.  You can watch an interview at: http://booktv.org/search.aspx?For=dog%20whistle%20politics

I calling someone a liar is not the best way to disagree.  
 




 He's right.  The Republican Party is 96% white, and the white population is diminishing as a proportion of the population.  Two former Chairs of the Republican Party have apologized for the party using the race card.  The party is fundamentally flawed.  I just finished reading "Dog Whistle Politics" and recommmend it for people who want to understand it.  Rand Paul is not a libertarian either.  He has some issues that he sounds great on, but then there are other issues.... 




 Why else?  They are stopping everyone else from tackling every other issue.  I don't think that's ignorant. 




 The Republican Party is 96% white.  I tend to think that is what drives their agenda, which would make it the most important issue that we face. 




 I wish they would all vote. 




 I wish I could give you solid facts to back me up, although I feel sure I am right.  I think that was the main reason of having an estate tax - so money wouldn't just accumulate in some families. 




 I agree with you.  Rand Paul is a perfect example. 




 It would be nice to have a Democratic President who wasn't pressured by the right for a change. 




 I bet these states had the most white voters also.  I'm reading "Dog Whistle Politics" now, and 96% of Romney voter's were white.  60% of white voters voted for Romney.  It's ugly. 




 Me too.
 




 How can you financially support a family that size? 




 They have no ethics. 




 Another caseworker here too.  You are so right.   




 What are THEY trying to accomplish?  Give a buddy a contract.  Humiliate poor people.  They suck. 




 There are libertarian liberals also. 




 I think they have turned in to a cult. 




 There needed to be an increase in food stamps due to what they have done policy wise to the public.  They have made them poor!  Also, cutting food stamps doesn't reduce poverty, it just would make life more difficult for those struggling to get by.  I just don't get republican's logic. 




 Let them.  I don't shop there anyway. 




 Too tired. 




 If the Democratic Party was smart, they would be have a voter registration project of all those folks that would be eligible in states not accepting medicaid. 




 The GOP has a strange coalition of libertarians, Christians and corporates.  




 Thanks for your words of support and guidance. Valuable insight. 




 Not soon enough.
 




 I think eventually all money will naturally flow to the richest leaving everyone else with nothing. 




 Well, the Wal-mart heirs have 40% of all income. 




 It is supposed to be majority rule, minority rights.  In this case, the minority (republicans) are stopping the majority from ruling altogether.
















 




 We're not broke.  It's just that all our money is ending up in a few hands. 




 I bought a book on how the songs came about which I loved.  If I had the time to look it up, I would. Think you can find it online. 




 Is that why Fox started a new program called "The Independents?" LOL. 




 We are. I think the largest solar plant in the U.S. is being built in the Mohave Desert (Ivanpah?) 




 You could start your own reddit, but great choices. 




 Yes, and the party that claims to support the constitution doesn't address that it is the only agency specifically mentioned in the consitution. 




 He also won a World War, freed Europe, and guided us through the Great Depression.  That being said, I do think the camps were horrible.  I'm curious too, who would your favorite president be? 




 A coworker's son works for an airlines.  He gets free flights and goes everywhere on standby.  He also can give free flights to family members and even friends.   




 Not at all. 




 At one time, taxes were 94 percent I believe. It was an incentive to earn more for a bigger take home amount. I do think this is excessive, but with the Walton's, it would still be millions. 




 Name one president who did everything perfectly. 




 I love it. 




 Utilities are making it difficult for consumers.  I thought I would look at starting a coop in my state - Nevada - perfect for solar.  It would be illegal for a consumer-sponsored coop. 




 I was shocked at the NRA's reponse to Newtown.  I thought maybe working together we could come up with something like background checks that everyone could support.  Nope, the NRA's answer was more guns in the schools.   




 I could understand banning cigarettes, but I don't understand the banning of e-cigs at all.  Someone help me here. 




 It helped, but the over-leverage of the banks were the main cause. 




 Don't have time to look for it now, but NPR did a story on it recently. 




 Since I just paid $30 for one of my three windshield wipers, and I'll have to replace it in two years, good.

 Rick Santorum considers Mandala's fight like the Republican's battle against Obamacare.  Unbelievable.

 




 I watched a documentary of a young couple who built one and was shocked at how expensive it was.  I think it cost them $30,000 which seems like a lot for the square footage. 




 Wait til you get 65 and see how much you want to go to work everyday.  Plan to have your kids support you? 




 Boomers actually paid 110%, more than they should, to get through this period. 




 My husband's uncle told him the same thing when he was young.  He is collecting it today after 50 yrs of hard work. 
























 On the surface, it is ridiculous.  Corporations are started by people and granted authority to exist by government. 




 Wow!  Do I wish I could draw like that! 




 I don't remember it being $1 ever.  It was about $10 in 1970. 




 Just beautiful! 




 2400 customers is unbelievable.

 It is worth seeing.  I laughed so hard it hurt.  I bought tickets during the presale too, but ended up being at 5 or 6 rows from the top. 




 Not necessarily related to polling, but President Reagan was not popular when he left office.  (I don't remember the numbers.)  Some republicans freaked out and funded a campaign to improve his image.  So, for years, there has been a well-funded effort to name places after him, write articles that made him look like a great president, etc. etc. 




 I like it. 




 I don't know.  Unions are able to turn people out to work in campaigns; they spend money and turn people out to walk precincts, make phone calls, GOTV.
 




 I want to be there right now. 




 It's so sad.  I hope it doesn't dry up and that we have a good El Nino year with lots of rain.  And good snow this winter in the Rockies. 




 Beautiful photo. 




 Dual goals.  Works. 




 That's what Brock said. 




 Just the hypocracy. 




 I love it! 




 Yep. 




 I wish they would join rather than fight us. 




 I couldn't get much from the article.  I would like to know more.  At the time, I heard that all the jobs that were supposed to be created in Mexico went to China instead. 




 Even worse are those SSI, SNAP and TANF recipients wail on on how much they hate assistance.  They deserve it, but no one else does. 




 One of my favorite books was Blinded by the Right by David Brock.  He was paid to help bring down Bill Clinton, but saw the light and started Media Matters.  He also outed Matt Drudge who is still the right-wing source for news. 




 We talk about sugar and fat, but I wonder what these antibiotics do to increase our fattening. 




 Conservatives hated the student protests of the 70's, and they blamed the professors for teaching liberal ideas.  They systematically worked (and there could be multiple ways to do this) to increase the costs of studies to restrict enrollment in schools and  to keep students and graduates so indebted that they would stop liberal arts studies and wouldn't have time to protest social injustices anymore.  They also worked to stop professors from getting tenure (where they could say what they believed without threat of losing their jobs) to adjunct professors who could not even support themselves any longer. 




 Beautiful job. 




 I think it will change, but I spoke with a company at a fair and it basically came down to that I would need a new roof, new windows and doors and new siding on my 55-yr old house before I could even consider solar.  LOL.  It would cost me the entire value of my house to prepare it for solar!  And I live in a neighborhood whose residents could benefit from solar. 




 Sorry, I should have posted this sooner.  c3connect.com was hiring 500 people this week. You were to apply online, then go to their open house at about 7830 Las Vegas Blvd. So. for interview.  40 hrs/week x 10/hr for customer service. Training starts 7/7 or 7/11.  Also paying $100 to each person giving a referral and $200 to that person if the new employee stays 6 months.  Not sure how many positions they actually filled this week, so you may still want to apply online.  Just made some corrections to this. Also, they are still having open interviews next week Monday - Thursdays also. 




 I agree.  I think that exposure and empathy is also valuable.  I would rather know people that TRY to do good than one those who didn't try or care.  Maybe it is possible that this gets translated into helping less fortunate at home when they return. 




 Also, we had a civil war over states rights (which was a really the right for states to decide if they could have slavery).  This war was fought and won, but they are still fighting for states rights.   




 It says alot that 90 percent of the republican party is white.  Source: "Dog Whistle Politics". 




 What else is new? 




 Especially in the bathroom! 




 There is a company that is hiring 500 people by Friday.  You need to apply online, then go prior to Friday for interview.  I have their location at my office but it is on the 6000 block of Las Vegas Blvd. So. Maybe you could call and get their address.  They are interviewing and hiring on the spot.  40 hrs x 12/hr.  At least it is getting back into the work force.  http://www.c3connect.com/ 




 Check history.  Republicans may reduce taxes, but create huge deficits that Democrats  have to clean up.  They usually spend great amounts on the military. 




 This is not a little kid - but I just learned a few years ago that pickles were pickled cucumers.  Never knew that... Duh. 




 A lot of hotels will hire felons IF they are upfront about it in the application.  We had a list at work and I updated it once just by making phone calls.  Have him call HR departments before he applies. 




 Looks like fun!
 




 The south already lost one civil war. 




 I'm curious if you are looking for work, and what kind? 




 Dr. Zhivago is my favorite movie.  The expansive scenes, beautiful music.  I never read the book or knew of the history behind it.  Thanks for the post. 




 It has been years since I read the book.  I loved the book until the end.  I didn't think the book led to the same conclusions as the author. 




 What an idiot. 




 Naked Gun. 




 These are the types of things that turn me off towards conservatives. 




 I'd have to do a search, but I remember reading someone was arrested for using a two dollar bill. I used to see them occasionally but bit recently. I'd love to have one!

 Just looked at the heading, but this is sick. 




 I remember an article that corporations were all getting their share, although the article specifically mentioned Toys R Us. 




 It's also the biggest contributor to the Democratic party.  Kill unions, Democrats cannot compete for big donors.  They have some, but not nearly enough for parity.  I really believe this is the main reason they are under attack. 




 You are right. It's just that we are viciously attacked when we try to make this distinction. 




 Their form of libertarianism is to tell others how to be. All you have to do is to look at the anti-women, anti-gay legislation being enacted in red states. They are religious fanatics. I don't care that they practice their religion, but don't try to put it on everyone else either. 




 Why do conservatives consistently support the one percent who are as a whole as corrupt as you can get? 




 Yes, the most of the rich want everyone else to work for pennies. 




 I'm so tired of it too, and then I think of these crazies trying to tell ME how to be.  I don't mind if they live their own lifes the way they want; just don't prevent me from living my life too.   




 Quit my job and take a much needed vacation to recover!  Who knows after that - some type of philanthropy. 




 There is no left wing radio.  I hate these equivalencies that just don't exist.  The left wing in America is centrist, not radical at all. 




 I want to know also. 




 Who was buying bonds when they offered 0 yield? 




 Let them eat cake! 




 I don't understand how they can remain in the same party.  Libertarians are the exact opposite of the religious right. 




 I appreciated your story.  We are not all perfect and to be successsful in reaching your goals is great.  Any kind of motivation helps. 




 Think it might be from Fukushima? 




 We could use some shaping of behavior - in terms of global warming - which may end up costing us a lot more in the long run rather than short term gains. 




 I'm not so sure. The PBS series Nature just had a show on crows who are exceptionally intelligent. They said they had a particularly large brain per body size. They mentioned other animals or mammals and said it was the ratio of brain to body size that determined intelligence. They probably meant as a species not an individual however. 




 I think you can get the parts at Home Depot or Lowe's, or google for other parts. 




 The original looked so much cooler though, but I heard that was the reason when they changed it. 




 I'm interested. Not sure how so keep me informed. 




 conspicuous consumption. 









 I hate to see this comparison.  There really is no left in this country.  Our left is center and it goes right from there. 




 The RJ had an article a while back giving 50-50 odds that it will dry up by 2021.  I've seen some photos of the lake near Sacramento that is dry, and Lake Shasta is also dropping fast.  One hope is that we have a good El Nino this year.

 Not sure it was bad for me, but I wish now that I did summer sschool and graduated a year early. That would have been cool. 




 And he did this while still a candidate.  Wasn't even president then. 




 It gets so old. 




 Thanks! 




 So true.  I've seen that so many times. 




 I watch jobs as they come out.  I have seen a bartender apprenticeship job advertised in the past week - not sure if it was through MGM properties or Stations, but keep trying.  You usually have to start as a bar back.  There is a bartender's union also.  Not sure if they are accepting new members, but it might be worth a call to check them out or to see what they recommend.  This is not a job, but the best I can think of right now. 









 How did the big tiles work out?   I've been looking at shower tiles and my husband wants me to get the 4x4 tiles.  By the way, it looks great.  You did a good job! 




 I read about the group out of Washington DC (Mt Pleasant) that started a buyers coop and with tax rebates, were able to get the price down to 1500 per house. I live in LV too. Don't think there are any tax rebates available today, but I'm sure we could do better.  We ought to brainstorm.  I couldn't find the original article but saw a newsletter that said it should cost from 5000 - 7000 now per house. 




 Basically, that's what FDR did. 




 People don't remember Daniel Ellsberg from the 70's. 




 Beautiful.  I love them!  I only wish I had enough to do one book.  I am recommending them to a friend who has traveled their entire life.

 That's the other problem.  The Chrisitan right believes in faith, not facts. 




 It is getting tough.  We had a doctor tell my husband he needed surgery when he needed a dentist.  I've had dentists tell me a group of my teeth needed to be taken out - and years later, I still have the teeth.  There is a book called "Trust me - We're Experts" about how lawyers bring in experts for both sides who contradict each other - for a fee.  There is always someone in there for the cash.   I try to look for friends or knowledgable people who are not looking for gain for guidance. 




 Is it a contest?

 Looks great. 




 What else is new? 




 Immediately. 




 Get names and years on the photos.  Ask about their parents and relatives.   I have these photos and don't know who is who. 




 I appreciate both of your comments.  I think about this ALL of the time, and how we can bring them around.  We are not dealing with a whole group of issues that can affect our lives.  And I can't even talk with my conservative friends or family about issues - they will not even debate. I think this is the issue main issue now of our time. 




 Some of these right-wing idiots will do anything to screw us.  This was an article I saved last year regarding a guy from Chicago:

 No other president cared as much for the working man either. 




 I know people living then who thought he was a God.

 I'm impressed. 




 Heis a good guy. 




 They tried to cut food stamps, medicare, and stop the affordable care act, but those darn democrats got in the way. 




 I'm curious what school she graduated from, like Michelle Bachman. 




 Good post. 




 He doesn't say crazy things like Ann Coulter.  I hate to see this false equivalency. 




 I thought this was a great article. I'm very interested in how we can bridge this divide and solve some of the problems that may cause our ultimate demise if ignored. 




 I listened to SCOTUS arguments on C-SPAN on another case and heard Scalia make an argument straight from Fox news that was totally inaccurate (the health care law). I could not believe what I was hearing! At least be factual! 




 You have Reagan saying that Government is the problem, and then it became one.    




 I worked as a job developer in the 80's in a low-income community.  I would ask clients to choose 1) more income or 2) closer proximitiy.  Most clients would ask for proximity because it was so difficult to get to jobs even with a bus service.  I see it still today. 




 She ought to get 100% subsidy.   




 I wouldn't want to wash it off -ever!  




 Very nice. 




 It was as fun as it looked. 




 Hmmmm. 




 No, I'm not bitching about the bailout.  I just would like another one for Detroit. 




 You're right.  I posted to the wrong comment!  Duh. 




 96% of Romney's vote was white, so I guess that leaves 4% of everyone else. 




 If you believe in fiscal sanity, vote Democratic!  All you have to to is look at spending under Reagan, Clinton, Bush and Obama, then tell me who is fiscally more sound. 




 I'll repeat myself.  Don't rewrite history.  All those Democrats became Republicans after the Civil Rights Act passed under Johnson.   




 Don't rewrite history.  Once the Civil Rights Act was passed, all the Dixiecrats became Republicans. 




 I wish all the people without medicaid would register and vote for democrats.  That would get some attention. 




 While my guitar gently weeps.

This is a previous question from subreddit vegas.  It is a full-day round trip to Death Valley going west - and it's a great day trip.  I like Zion too - going east - about 3.5 hr drive but less than the Grand Canyon.  Maybe Mt. Charleston - only about 1/2 hr, but not a lot to do once you get there. 




 It will only go away if enough people want it to.  You try working for a living at 80. 




 That is funny.  Thanks for sharing. 




 I think I would have helped my sister though. 




 I think I love bridges. 




 I'm with you. 




 You sound just like a republican. 




 I'm grateful that I learned to type in high school.   




 I say this all the time in Reddit, but the Republican Party is 90% white, and Romney's vote was 96% white.  This ought to tell you all that is needed to know.  Source:  Dog Whistle Politics. 




 








I remember seeing George Soros on tv prior to GW Bush second campaign saying if he wins, something is wrong with us.  He's right, something is wrong with us.




 




 And I believe Nixon negotiated with the Vietnamese prior to his election, also treasonous.

 Yum. 




 I really enjoy Michael Palin's travel shows - he doesn't do a lot of them, but the ones he has done have been really good.  You probably can view some on them on line by googling his name. 




 One of my favorite life stories:  We had a welfare rights march in our town in the 70's.  There was another group who organized an anti-welfare march.  A year or so later I was at our local legal services office as a volunteer and I recognized the leader of the anti-welfare march at the office.  He had experienced a heart attack, lost his job, then his wife and his home.  He had no health care, and was seeking legal services.  His life had literally fallen apart.  I remember speaking with him and he regretted the role he had played when fighting these "welfare mothers". 




 A couple of points:  I do not believe it is a ponzi scheme; Ponzi schemes run out of investors eventually.  Social security will not; benefits would be reduced first.  It is NECESSARY unless you want to support your parents late in life when they are not able to work.  Finally, I wished I had taken a video of my republican congressman also who also called it a Ponzi scheme at a town meeting.  Republicans don't really want to get rid of social security - they just want to get their greedy hands on it. 




 I agree.  It sucks. 




 It will hurt when you are too old to work and your social security will not cover any of your living expenses,  And yes, it will be there. 




 Well, tell us more.  




 They have the majority vote. 




 The above post is a repost, but thought it would be interesting to LV redditors. 









 Not really.  I saw them test the spillways one year letting more water through the dam than they ever had.  It was great.  That being said, scientists now say that there is a 50-50 chance that the river will dry up in the next 20 yrs.  http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/02/080213-AP-lake-mead.html 




 I recently went to a conference with a friend (out of LV).  She lost her wallet TWICE before we landed at our destination.  They paged her the first time and she got it back.  We boarded and she left her wallet again(!) on the plane.  This time it when on to another destination! The airlines mailed it to her at our hotel so she did get it back before we left town, but most of the money was gone.  She did her ID back though. 




 I appreciate the chart.  I am old and still want some type of entrepreneurship project.  I still am working 40 hrs/week, but want to give it one last go.  Just haven't found the project I want to throw myself in to. (I did help create a few great nonprofits when I was younger though).  Also, I want a partner to review things with, share responsibility.  I've been looking for a good partner to conspire with, and everyone seems to be too busy doing their own thing.  I'm not giving up however! 




 I met a woman at Wal-Mart one day who told me she credited the elllipitcal with her 200 lb weight loss. 



















 I loved that movie. 




 Thank you. 




 I don't remember when it happened, but a baby was identified as being the next Dalai Lama, but was kidnapped by the Chinese. 









 I learned in school that southern California climate was like the Mediteranian. 




 Thank you. 




 Isn't it insane?  Unions are not perfect, but they really did help the workers are different times in our history.  We have a lot of trolls on reddit too. 














 Different people have different needs.  I think it would be more work and more expensive to break it down into different categories.  And in the end, does it matter? 









 Yeah, free speech.  I just read about another big donor from Nevada who makes his money on student loans.  What sleezeballs. 




 Teachers are unionized, and probably one of the largest unions in the US.   Unions are probably one of the biggest contributors to democrats also.  Kill the unions, kill the Democratic Party.  It's political. Too add to this, teachers are highly educated and for many years were underpaid.  They learned that they could lift their standard of living by working together, unionizing.  And they have done better that they did before they were unionized. 




 I'm assuming when the term welfare is used in this discussion, that it includes welfare and food stamps.  Remember that welfare is time limited - maximium 5 years in the US from the welfare reform law passed  during the Clinton administration.  Most welfare recipients are young single mothers, and if not working, are required to attend vocational training or volunteer 20-30 hrs/week.  2-parent households are required to meet a 35 hr/week requirement.  Those unable to work must have a doctor's statements. 




 Part E - for Everybody. 




 I would prefer the GNP:

 Soros goals are for an open and democratic society (see his foundation).  What are this guy's goals? 




 Just look at the denial in these comments! 




 If they would only stop and think. 




 I work with TANF clients, and I bet most of the cash money (which isn't much) either goes for diapers or towards rent. 









 My husband's uncle said the same thing 50 years ago.  My husband is receiving social security today - and we bless FDR. 




 That's absurd. 




 I went to the Netroots Convention this year in Detroit, and yes, I think it is a beautiful city.  I was given a short tour of the city, but missed these lobbies.  Unbelievably beautiful.  The city has been threatening to turn off water to 40% of the city's residents however since they have been unable to pay their bills.  Unemployment is high since GM left.  Corporations have no moral values.  They can pick up and leave a mess - and nothing anybody can do about it. 




 I don't remember any impeachment proceedings against Bush.  i remember Pelosi saying she just wanted to move forward. 




 Like Bush didn't??? 




 Well, they spent millions trying to get Bill Clinton.  What's new except these guys don't know how to legislate. 




 I've been wanting to read the book.  A later UW team was also amazing.  My uncle was part of the junior varsity rowing team from UW in 1948.  It is an interesting story too that I only learned about after reading about it online at UW.  The varsity team couldn't go to the Olympics (i don't remember why), and the JV team took their place.  They were not expected to do well, but won the Gold.  My cousins took me to a bar at Northgate shopping center last year to show me a full wall mural of the team! 




 No, we just need to set priorities. 




 No, it is not a ponzi scheme.  Ponzi scheme runs out when there are no more investors.  As long as people continue to pay in to the system, there can always be social security.  Also, they can raise the rates or cut benefits a small amount, but people will continue to be paid.  Also, think about supporting your parents when they are old and unable to work.  Isn't it better that they can remain self-sufficient in their old age?  And how will you feel at that age?   Ready to work until you drop? 




 Tax em 80% for keeping it there. 




 Right. I mean 96% of Romney's vote came from white people. 




 I would love to see a reddit map of precincts, and recruit reddit captains for each precinct.  That might be a project worth working on!  Move-on had a great project one year (not sure why they didn't continue it), but I was able to download every voter in my precinct and contact them either by phone or in person.  I am biased and support democrats (at least good ones).  It would be cool to target democrats in republican districts and see if is possible to flip the district.   Also, I noted on a previous comment that I would target medicaid-eligible people also who are unable to sign up for medicaid as their state did not accept medicaid expansion (21 states?).  These people could seriously benefit from voting in their self-interest. 




 I would recruit all those people who are being denied medicaid because their states refused to expand medicaid under ACA.  (21 states?)  They really have something to gain from voting at the state level. 




 I'm not so sure.  Vegas was not built with buses in mind.  It might take you two hours to get to work. 




 No, I bet if you look deeper, there are contracts going to cronys. 




 They also have all of the income. 




 Still, 12 of 466 is pretty small. 




 But those guys were fighting the federal government; these protesters are not.   




 Eric Holder is going this week, probably sent by Obama. 




 They just don't play by the rules - at least since the 70's and maybe before then.  Also, they have more money than they need legitimately, so they start looking at other things to fund. 




 What a Wonderful World. 




 I have some lamps that do that too, and I was looking for replacements and didn't know what to call them either! 




 I met someone once with that name also. 




 I used to wonder about the contradiction, but you now hear them referring to innocent life.   




 If we had supported states' rights as a nation, we would still have slavery. 




 That's enough to put a chill down my spine. 




 Democrats have a lot of libertarian values, more than republicans, I believe.  We support all of the issues you listed. 




 I think your comment is the first one I've ever saved.  Thank you for sharing. 




 Local governments target them.  That's one of the arguments about having a strong central government that support minority rights.   




 Whew! 




 I would rather live in pain and depression for my entire life than to see the grief and pain suffered by my mother on the loss of her son. 




 Mine too. 




 Not 96% which is the white percentage of vote that Romney received. 




 By design I believe. 




 9   1/2 Weeks. I loved the movie, so I thought I would read the book. Just awful and there was no resemblance between the movie and the book. 




 I used their paint for years and was shocked at the sales price last time I was there. I think it was $60 on sale.  I like the paint at Walmart just the same now. 




 Conspiracies do happen!  I can't address your questions, but I heard a recorded phone call on an old tv show (Investigative Reports I believe) that wowed me - where one mob person told another that the hit was on for JFK.  I was also convinced by Thom Hartmann's book - http://www.amazon.com/Legacy-Secrecy-Long-Shadow-Assassination/dp/1582435359
By the way, I think I found the Investigative Report show also that covered it:  http://www.amazon.com/Investigative-Reports-Jack-Anderson-JFK/dp/B000FKP0TG
A lot of responsible people have said they don't  believe it was a conspiracy, but it would be hard to convince me otherwise. 




 We can't pay for education, but we want to have an arena?? 




 Most people don't watch what is going on.  I meet people all the time who just don't have a clue. 




 Try La-Z-Boy swival glider. 




 I think this was the most recognized of any National Geographic covers. 




 You're right.  I used to call it black and white channel because of all the World War II shows.  I think Fox bought it, and now we get stuff not even related to history! 




 They said they wouldn't do it until they did it. 




 The southern strategy?  Lee Atwater spoke publically about about using the southern strategy in 1981.  I believe that Ken Mehlman also apologized for it.  You can believe what you want, but I think it has been pretty much accepted for fact.  And the idea of a small government.  We fought a war over "states' rights", and the confedercy lost.  The original Articles of Confederation failed also.  Good try, but you can't convince me on either topic. 




 Or those that make money off the 10%. 




 He's not.  I've known him for decades. 




 Good job!
 




 Some, but most tea baggers are older than this.  Most of the Woodstock generation fought against the war in Viet Nam, fought for civil rights  and did some good things.  We are still fighting. 




 Ferris Bueller's Day Off;  Naked Gun. 




 Democrats are not perfect, but they are not crazy. I read that on a bumper sticker and it's correct as far as I can tell. 




 Democrats need to hold their own districts and win on republican districts. It could happen if all those people not covered by Medicaid in republican districts voted! 




 Democrats need to hold their own districts and win on republican districts. 




 90% white. 




 This has probablly been posted on reddit previously, but I still check it out.  Scares me too:  http://www.upworthy.com/a-smartypants-scientist-makes-an-easy-analogy-about-our-planet-and-now-im-scared 




 Sunset Park has a mile path around it's pond (and I think over 7 miles of paths).  It's at Eastern and Sunset. Road.  People do run there. 




 It doesn't matter what links I could put forth - we see the world from two different frames.  I know that you know that democrats became republicans after Jim Crow - part of the well-known southern strategy.  And I personally believe that voter ID laws are an attempt to restrict minority voting.  And there are a lot of people who believe this or the republican party would not be 90% white, or that Romney would get more than 4% of the minority vote.  
The whole concept of limited government is bizarre to me.  It is my belief that the Articles of Confederation failed because they didn't give the federal government enough power to function.  We also fought a civil war over states rights, and the South lost!  Can't we just let the issue die and get on with it??!!!  Sorry about the 18 day response - I don't check this area of reddit frequently enough...I do appreciate your response though. 




 Yes, and Republicans said they woudn't shut down the government either. 




 I have a friend whose in his 60's and has done that his entire life.  His longest job was was doing newspaper delivery as a teenager.  He is fortunate to have a career in which he can do this, but his social security is small and he will never have a stressless retirement. 




 I didn't watch the video, but read the article.  These guys make false claims, then walk away.  I would go berserk in their presence also. 




 Less hypocracy. 




 If the member services will not tell you, call a social worker at the welfare office.  They know which health plans cover which mental health services (and providers). 




 When they were talking about taxing the rich, I wanted to call it the Walton tax too. 




 Maybe Matt Tiiabbi.  I love reading him, ah, the irreverence! 









 My grandparents loved Lawrence Welk too.  I can't believe they stilll play his shows! 




 No, but continuing resolutions were ongoing for many years.  They should do budgets, but it's always been a difficult process. 




 Here's a Pew study.

 I've been wondering if we would have another civil war.  Things can get so ugly. 




 It's pretty clear what drives them. 




 Several things:  To lose weight, I have to cut way back and exercise.  I lose weight and need to cut my calories again to lose more weight.  I don't think I can cut them any farther!  I also have a history of yo-yo dieting.  I always end up weighing more than before I started!  I think if I would have worked out more when I was young and never dieted, I wouldn't weigh what I do today.  I don't know if that makes sense, but that is how I feel.  It is also a lot of work and takes more time than I want to spend on the topic.  I do know I would feel better though. 









 I am reading a book called the Zero Maginal Cost Society about how many of the basics - power, education and some other major items will be so cheap to produce, that they will be near free.  It will take major battles to get there, but he convinced me.
http://www.thezeromarginalcostsociety.com
 




 I am reading Zero Marginal Cost Society - http://www.thezeromarginalcostsociety.com/
about a new collaborative age where basics - including energy, education, etc. will almost be free - because the cost to produce it will be so low.  There will be some battles to get there, but he made his point to me. 




 Depending upon your area of study, you might be able to get a year or more written off by working in a low-income community.  




 Marvin Gaye had it right:  Sexual Healing. 




 They need to be shamed in to doing the right thing, and Cuban seems to be doing that. Good for him! Fortune magazine had a  article recently about the same topic.
 http://fortune.com/2014/07/07/taxes-offshore-dodge/ I read some of the comments.  One woman thinks they are moving companies to areas for low labor costs.  No, they are moving their corporate headquarters to counties like Switzerland to specifically avoid American taxes.  They probably have a better standard of living there. 




 Nice job! 




 I spent summers there as a kid.  It sure looks different today. 




 Eve of Distruction. 




 Why do fiscal conservatives vote republican anyway?  They say they are fiscally sound, but if you look at it historically, they are not.  They spend it different ways - mostly for military, and usually end up with a lot of ripoffs due to deregulation.  Reagan is a prime example. Cut taxes, expand the military, deregulate (which killed Savings and Loans and created a huge ripoff of HUD which cost billions.))  Democrats at least have a plan for pay for what they spend and try to monitor spending.  They also realize that peoples rising boat lifts the whole society. 




 We may all sink with that view. 




 I knew someone like that 20 yrs ago who had clients who would pay him - and he was respected in the field! I would hear him on radio shows talking as an expert.  But he was just a fast-talker - just like you are writing about.  I knew his wife.  Not sure if he is around today.  I think the only license you would need is a straight business license (but I'm not an expert).  UNLV offered a class one semester on handicapping and I made my husband go - it caused a stir (not sure I remember why), and they never offered the class again.  That being said, there is probably room for a smart handicapper.  The ones that publish in the paper have always sucked.  The really good handicappers work for the sportsbooks setting odds in the first place. 




 It's true.  Look back at Republican administrations.  Most broke the bank; then dems have to come in and straighten it out.  They just spend it on different things. 




 Reid won't bring up issues that can't pass.  He is a vote counter and knows exactly what the vote will be before he brings it to the floor.  And remember, he needs 60 votes on most issues.  There is a difference.  He didn't decide on Obama's inauguration day to fight republicans on every issue.  And quit calling people morons.  Does not lead to a good discussion. 




 The republicans held a meeting on the day Obama was inaugurated and decided to fight him on every issue.  Just google it to see the sources.  They never gave him a chance. 




 Reading the responses, I swear there are more millennials who are conservatives or libertarians on reddit.  Drives me crazy. 




 Ron Paul is not a libertarian or he would believe in choice. 




 True. 




 I don't believe Bush won either election.  He was given the first one and I personally think they cheated in Ohio to win the second. 




 If it is true, good. They need to vote. White youth voted for Romney in the last election, so turnout is critical. 




 And why 90% of the republican party is white, and 96% of Romney's vote was white. 




 Except look at the states they are in control.  Hundreds of laws to take away women's rights, prevent people from voting, or an yes, tax breaks for the rich, not everyone else. 




 Not false.  I read that in the beginning.  They are the same folks that Nixon called the moral majority. 




 I usually start by cutting out white foods - basically sugar and flour.  Can't live like that forever though. 
























 I just watched an expert on C-Span who wrote a book on The Bill of Rights.  She went back to the discussions at the time and said it was ALL about well-regulated militias and not at all about personal rights.  The militias were run by states and were designed to keep the states free of the potential tyrannical control of a central government.  http://www.c-span.org/person/?carolberkin

 No, but I had a friend who was asked to drive while the cab driver was making out with her friend.  They were going to a restaurant in the Bay Area and were afraid they could nor get a cab back, so invited the driver to dine with them.  He hit it off with her friend and was asked to drive while they got in the back of the cab. If you knew my friend, you would be laughing on the floor to hear the story.

 In this case, be grateful for Obama.  He would veto it.  I just love that this is the party that says that want to reduce the deficit.  They never do; they just have different priorities. 









 "..the Civil War was not fought over slavery but rather because the Union and President Abraham Lincoln acted without regard for the Constitution to accumulate power".  This sounds like today's twisted arguments over Obama. 

  



















 How many of those 16 million vote?  It didn't help in the last election.

 I've been wondering about the net carb thing - since I have a habit of eating Atkins bars.  But I also read that carbs are carbs and net carbs is only a marketing tool.  I would be interested in hearing what others say about this.

 Democrat or Republican?  I think there is room at the local level, or more opportunities if you want to travel.  I would make myself known at offices of elected officials and the party you are associated with.  You could get hired as a representative or hear about a 501(C)(4) position associated with policy.  Find a new candidate, do some fundraising to pay for your salary, get your candidate elected, then start your own consulting firm.  You could start out as a political writer like Jon Ralston.  You can get government jobs.  If you are a Democrat, check out Organized Karma.   If it doesn't look like there is potential in the long-term, go to law school.  I had a poli sci degree and worked mostly in nonprofits, but there were other options had I pursued them.

 Republicans will treat ANY Democratic president as radical, too liberal, etc.  In many regards, Clinton was one of them - a southern white male, but you would have thought at the time that he was the devil. 




 Not a small luxury, but I'd take that round-the-world cruise for a year. 




 If you don't mind staying in customer service, try c3connect.com.  Also, if you don't mind paperwork, the welfare office has been hiring like crazy since Obamacare.  nv.gov - family services specialist 1.  
It's a tough job, but stable and full time. 




 I agree.  It scares me. 




 Republicans now control 30 states.  They can change the rules in these states how delegates are allocated: http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2014/11/18/3593173/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-gops-newest-plan-to-rig-the-2016-presidential-election/
Remember, these guys stop at nothing and have deep pockets. 




 Am I the only one who thinks about overpopulation? 



















 Congratulations!
 




 It was slow and easy-going.  We entered the fast-lane starting the 70's. 




 Roger Springs is cool.  Just don't drink the water! http://hotspringsoak.com/rogers-hot-springs.html 




 What I want to see is a statute of Obama with his birth certificate in his hand and a big grin on his face.  Maybe giving the bird to the right wing  might be cool too. 









 I wish we could start a reddit coop and buy/install our own at a reduced rate. 




 No clue, huh? 




 I'm a liberal and I agree.  I'm not sure what we can do differently and I think about it often.  You don't want the unintended consequenses. 




 Also, the military was totally socialist.  Now it's probably half and half.  We have a lot of private contractors involved with the military. 




 I worked as a job counselor for 8 summers for a federally-subsidized Summer Youth Program where about 1,000 kids worked for nonprofits, schools, etc. for 8 weeks during the summer.  Some even worked as firefighters.  This program operated for years and Congress kept reducing it to almost nothing,  It gave young people the opportunity to see how the working world works, and many of those kids went on to become successful, productive citizens.  I think it was worth it.  They also had a short-term program for adults - and when the economy was down, more money was allocated.  You may not like it, but it keeps people in the job market, the money gets spent in the community and we all do better.  I hate this trajectory we are on.  All the money now goes to the rich in terms of tax cuts.  And contrary to what many believe, they are not necessarily the job-creators.  We subsidize the rich with their low-paying salaries through tax benefits, and in making up the difference in low-wages with welfare, food stamps and medical. 




 Keep saying that while all the tax breaks go to billionaires, and you end up working for peanuts.  We are all going to be poor at the hands of Republicans.  They don't support whites - they support billionaires! 




 Thank you for stating this. 









 Amazing how that is probably NG's most famous cover. 




 They wear me out watching them.  They have deep enough pockets. 




 It wouldn't be that high if businesses and lawmakers  hadn't work to bring down wages. 




 I don't know, but loosening regulations usually results in ripoffs. 




 Nursing school might be cheaper here.  You can become a nurse in 18 months at NV State College if you have the prereqs.  You can always take the skills back to Washington.  Cost of living is cheaper here also.  I would love to have my grandparents house on Queen Anne Hill overlooking Elliot Bay.  It was sold for $10,000 after they died, and would sell for $1.5 million today. 



















 They will try to impeach him instead. 




 He was the minority leader before he was majority leader.  He was very skilled and will do it again.  He does support support black and hispanics that have solid membership in the party-but not 94%.  I don't know where you got that number.   




 Silver does it to my skin. 



















 I think that is a great idea. 




 I learned this lesson when I was young.  We had a march in our town supporting welfare clients who had been cut off the rolls.  An anti-welfare group was started.  I ran in to the leader of the anti-welfare group at our legal aid office.  He had had a heart attack, his wife left him, he lost his house and was looking for free legal help.  It comes around. 









 The Republican Party is 90% white.  We should be calling it the White Person's Party.  Romney's vote was 96% white.   I post these numbers all the time on reddit because I was so shocked when I initially read them.  Young people are only less republican because they they are a more diverse group.  Young whites still voted for Romney.   




 But do you want to impose your values on everyone else?  I'm a progressive and I support your rights to have your values.  But don't impose them on me. 




 This woman seems crazy.  I just don't get it. 




 Are you kidding?  What war did he get us in to?  What economy did he crash? 




 Very cool. 




 They don't see it that way however. 




 That is what question 3 is all about.  I believe the tax is a percent OVER 1 million income, so if you made 1,000.001, you would be taxed 20 cents.  I don't think that is so bad. 




 Hotels have lobbyists which come out of the woodwork the minute a lottery is suggested.  




 I voted yes on all three.  The legislature is unable to pass a tax to help schools.  They had time through many sessions to come up with other options.  When they don't do anything,  we have to wait another two years until they meet again.  In the meantime, nothing is done.  We have to do what they are incapable of doing.   25% of the children in the schools live in poverty.  I do not have children, but believe that all children need a good education.  Teachers also have a great investment in their education and need to be paid a decent wage also.  I believe they cannot recruit enough teachers because the starting salary is so low.  This is crazy.

Mining has not been taxed since the State created its constitution. They had lobbyists even then and wrote it into the state constitution that they be exempt from taxes.  They have had their free ride and now need to contribute to the state's wellbeing also.  

I voted for the Court of Appeals, but do not have a passion for the issue.  I just can imagine that the other courts are backed up too.  




 They have been great with my personal banking also. 




 A photo area where friends can get their photos taken. 




 I'm not sure I would take my girlfriend to Sherrie's ranch. 




 If you don't mind staying off the strip, you can get a better price and enough to rent a car.  https://www.bconnectedonline.com/resnetf.php?STEHOTEL 




 Bingo. 




 I've always had the suspicion that this was the case. 




 The numbers are all over the board. 




 It's a more beautiful city than I thought it would be.  I went to a convention there earlier in the year.  The house are cute and the neighborhoods look better than mine if you don't mind seeing a few burned houses in every neighborhood. 









 Pretty much sums it up. 




 Good luck.  I live in the area and will keep my eyes open.  Do check at the pound.  (By the way, I was ticketed last week by Animal Control for letting my dog out in front of my house.  She never goes more than 1 house away, but someone complained. I guess she would lick them to death.) 




 I saw you!  Good luck too! 




 I'm older than anyone here.  I would move in a heartbeat if I didn't have a husband who doesn't want to leave my zipcode.
 









 I remember when abortions were illegal everywhere.  If you could afford it, you could fly to Mexico for a legal abortion (or elsewhere).  If you couldn't, you opted for a local illegal one.  I knew women in both categories.  I knew a young woman who was blind-folded in a hotel room.  Another ended up in the hospital for a DNC.  One died. 




 Guys (and some females) like to view themselves as "tough".  It's absurd really. 




 I'm sorry to hear this.   




 I read his books in the 70's and I hear Hillary did her master's thesis on him (he was from Chicago and she was also from Illinois).  He was a successsful union organizer and his the threat of his tactics were enough to win issues.  His tactics were fun for members to participate in by members.  Example:  The mayor of Chicago loved the opera.  He threatened to have a picnic serving beans to union members and providing them free tickets to attend the opera.  Never had to pull off the picnic; the threat was enough to win his way. 




 This guy is crazy.  He was all over Clinton and his poor staff who couldn't afford the legal challenges and stress.   I was anxious to see how he would be under GW Bush.  Hardly heard a word.  Now he is apoletic about Obama. 




 Pioche is kind of fun.  Also a little lake there is you like fishing.  They have community fairs several times a year, and people come from all over to attend.    




 The supremes gave GW Bush the presidency.   




 You can ignore reality if you want. 




 I see volunteers hired all the time also. 




 I'd prefer to beat them however.
