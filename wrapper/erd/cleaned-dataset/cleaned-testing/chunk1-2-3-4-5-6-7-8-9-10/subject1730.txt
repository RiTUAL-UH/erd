 That's rather brilliant! I was just thinking of getting some actual baby diapers to use as stuffers and putting one on her. 




 I agree with /u/Mattykinss. Munches are a great way to ease into the community and get to know others. Most munches are vanilla type events due to their public setting. 

The biggest key is to communicate. Check out the Big Little Podcast episode on [Communication](http://www.biglittlepodcast.com/2012/07/episode-56-communication/). If she already supports you in this, it sounds like you would be able to talk to her about it and have her listen. It's going to be tough, but it will be worth it in the end. Trust me, going behind her back is no bueno. And even if she doesn't want to go, at least she knows you're being upfront with her and open about it. 

One additional thought would be to find out what kink she's into (assuming you haven't done this already) and support her in that. But that's just my two cents. 




 That is adorable! 

*makes grabby hands* 




 I've got a stuffed Hello Kitty that I want to put a diaper on. 




 I am so super excited to see this company relaunching. I didn't know much until today when I started digging. But I'm excited for where you plan on taking ABU and can't wait to see what fresh ideas and changes you bring to the AB/DL community! 




 I've been there before! Quite a bit. Thankfully, I've gotten past the binge and purge stage but it's taken a while. I'm at the point where I'll wear (when I can), but I've realized that this is a part of me. I hid it with my ex-wife and let's just say that things did not go well when she found out. But, I wear when I can and have also realized that no one really knows but me. And if anyone **does** figure out, chances are they won't think it's because I enjoy wearing. So, I know it's hard to not feel that shame, but once you accept that it's a part of who you are, and the rest of the world be damned, it gets a lot easier and that shame fades. 




 I've found that pinching them together after they've gone on helps too. I haven't tried your method but I will next time I get a batch :) 




 All my friends are dead. 




 Burn it to the ground. 




 Alex the cum dumpster...

You don't want to know. 




 Serve him breakfast

Implying that I have food in my house! 




 I would contact the company you purchased them through. Talk to customer service and explain what's going on. They might want things that can be found on each package like the lot number. If it's a good company that cares about their customer, they should either offer to replace it or offer a refund. They might want you to send any unopened packages back though so that they can return them to the manufacturer.  




 That is amazing!!!!  




 It's always a great feeling to get it on just right! Congratulations!!!! 




 Ever since I got my Twilight wig, I've been in love with the purple and pink combo! 




 I want more cloth .

Mainly MLP AIOs... 




 This conversation is bringing out my little :D 




 RAWR!!!!! :D 




 I want the dinosaurs! However, my little side wants the hearts and skulls though! 




 I want some from [Pajama City](http://www.pajamacity.com) 




 I forgot to mention my shark footed sleeper! I got it at Target a couple of years ago.  




 I've got 3 kigurumi! Red Panda, Totoro and a summer totoro. 




 Shiny Captain! 




 Those are adorable!!! 




 I love the Wheel of Time universe. You're dropped in at a cataclysmic point in the history, one who's repercussions are felt through out the entire saga. During this, the journey of a multitude of characters is chronicled and you're often found wondering if one of them is the chronicler (Loial). You follow the path of Rand al'Thor as he journeys along the path that has been set for him, fighting it most of the way. Watching characters change and grow into who they will need to be is rather unique as well and one that I love. With each character, you start to develop a bond and get excited over their victories and saddened by their defeats. For example, my favorite character is Mat ([Matrim Cauthon](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/wot/images/3/32/Mat.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20091212050852)). I love how he's put through a version of hell and comes out on top on the other side. From the loss of memories to those becoming a great General, it's an amazing story and one that I can go back to time and time again. 

Additionally, the community that built up around it has been amazing. There's [artwork](http://seamassketches.blogspot.com/), [table-top games](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wheel_of_Time_Roleplaying_Game) (as supported by Wizards of the Coast), even [a video game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wheel_of_Time_%28video_game%29) was created. All of which take place in this universe with an [absentee God](http://wot.wikia.com/wiki/Creator). A very real [Devil character](http://wot.wikia.com/wiki/Dark_One), even its own unique brand of [magic](http://wot.wikia.com/wiki/One_Power) which introduces even more into the lore. 

Overall, it's one of my all time favorite series and worth the time to read. 




 The issue I've had is to do with the sides. Even with everything set, if I go while laying down, there's the chance that it will rise up and leak down the sides that have no padding what so ever. Plastic pants might be able to help keep everything contained. 




 Fun fact! I used to eat sunflower seeds by the bucket. And then my body developed an intolerance to the baked shells! Now I haven't eaten sunflower seeds in over 18 years.  




 Everyone knows his parents are dead. Everyone except the person who wrote in that shitty caption. 




 I don't think all are, but a majority of them have become a platform in which to advertise. However, once people start asking questions, it's not always about the product they're pushing. It gives regular people a chance to interact with the celebs. 




 Well said good sir! 




 I am a random person and I want to wear fuzzy hats...   
























 And the guys (and gals) who work the tenders love ATON. Everyone I've ever met who worked a tender had been trying to get back to one. 




 I love how people forget that they USCG is the 5^th branch of the US Armed Services. If I recall correctly too, the High Endurance Cutters (Hamilton Class) were picked up by the USCG after being rejected by the US Navy as a ship design. Additionally, putting a CIWS right over the screw is a horrible fucking design. 




 If I had to guess, I would say that it looks like a nun buoy. 




 As a former Coastie, it warms my heart to see this! Thanks and keep up the great work!

I also managed to find all three of your easter eggs! 




 I highly doubt that. Even though they are law enforcement, every year their budget keeps getting cut and they can barely maintain their aging fleet. 




 Hopefully the tapes will be better this time around. 




 I'm now lurking in diaperfurs :P 




 Awesome! Thanks for the response! 




 Fantastic! I shall be joining both shortly! 




 Thank you! I shall check it out! 




 That's quite nice! And it looks really good on you! 




 That's sort of the problem with #biglittlepodcast on Rizon. It's great when the podcast is going on but for the most part, it's dead. I miss the old Yahoo chat groups :( 




 So freaking cute and adorable! Where did you get it? 




 Hello everyone. Does anyone know of any AB/DL specific IRC channels other than the one for the biglittlepodcast? 




 Amazing photos and costumes! Fun fact! In the book, the apprentice's name is [Michael Fisher](http://howlscastle.wikia.com/wiki/Michael_Fisher) and he's actually 15 years old. 




 Good for you! Even though Depends are generally disliked, they are a relatively cheap intro for adult diapers! Enjoy them! 




 I guess the question to ask yourself is "What are you looking to get out of all of this?" Her interests are rather small but her groups show that she's a member of a couple of AB/DL groups. So she's got some interests in the fetish even if nothing's listed in her profile. Another thing to bear in mind is that not everyone has a webcam. I know almost every laptop now has one built in, but if she has a desktop, there's no guarantee of a webcam. You could always ask if she's got an amazon wishlist and ask her to put a webcam on there that you could purchase for her too.  




 Hmmm... You might be able to find something that's fragrant free or you can try a corn starch based powder. However, you can help cut down on the smell by applying a bit less and rubbing it in. I've found that even though we can be paranoid because WE know we're diapered, most everyone else either doesn't know or if they smell it, won't care. I went to school with a gentleman who would dust his crotch with baby powder every day to help cut down on chafing. 




 TO sorta quote Spacey: "Tell them if it will further enhance your relationship." If you think it will make things between you even better, then tell her!  




 One thing I would recommend is to give your body like 30 minutes or so to air out each day. Letting your diaper area breathe a bit each day will help cut down on rashes. Also, lots of powder and/or oil or lotion. Which ever you prefer. Other wise enjoy it! What's your go-to diaper for daily wear and wearing at night?     




 At first, it seemed to be a bit cobbled together, but it's become much smoother. I feel that happens to any podcast though as they figure out what's going on and how they want things to run/flow. As for content, I love hearing the behind the stories of some of reddit's biggest celebrities. I also feel that things like banana for scale and such are so fleeting that it's like trying to hype up pogs. There one minute and gone the next. Personally though, I like hearing about the minutia and little bits of trivia that not everyone might not know about stories and people. 




 I've enjoyed this podcast! I'm starting to get into listening to podcasts and this is one of my favourites! Keep up the good work and I can't wait to listen to next weeks!  




 I love the composition of old and new. 




 Out of everything there... I want your shoes :P 




 I wish you both the best in this! 




 Great choices! Personally, I'm not a fan of Molis anymore but that's because it seems all of the padding always clumps down to the middle. 




 And time to save this page to the Diaper Supply folder! 




 So freaking cute!!!  




 I haven't tried it, but would love to. Even if there's no milk. I think it would put me in little headspace pretty quickly. 




 I wore cloth as a kid. My brother was the one to wear disposables... I might be able to make a small cloth diaper for her. 




 True, but it would look better than a 24/7 on her :P

I'm not in a rush though. But I love the idea of making my own! 







































 OH man. I think this was taken either Jungfrau or somewhere along the journey up to Jungfrau. All three (Jungfrau, Mnch and Eiger) are all part of the Bernese Alps. This photo was taken back in 2006 though, so I'm not exactly certain of the position that it was shot. 




 Curses! I have to work so no live stream for me :/

I'll write out the story in an email for you and Spacy for your show! 




 http://lildiaper.tumblr.com 














 True. But after serving with the USCG for more than a decade, there is a bit of love there :P 




 I know they're much smaller, but any chance of doing this with the aircraft of the US Coast Guard? 




 And now I need to go play Mass Effect 2....

Fantastic work though! 














 I can do that! When are you guys looking at recording this episode? 




 Gah! I used to live out there. My first real intro to ageplay with another person took place out there. I've got so many good memories of the area and want to go back so badly! 




 Thank you! 




 Awesome! I shall be waiting with baited breath :D 




 How long ago was this? 




 lol. Fair enough. Needless to say, I've loved the story and have read through it a few times! I can't wait to read what you put out next! Keep up the amazing work! 




 I don't suppose there's any plans for a sequel or another story set in the same setting (town, universe, which ever you prefer to call it) is there? 




 YES!!! I would love to see an adult pull up that isn't shit.  




 The small boat in question is a 64' SPC-SV (Special Purpose Craft - Screening Vessel). I am not sure of which sub was being escorted at that time. 









 While I agree, I don't think the USCG would be able to afford it. They can barely afford to upgrade their current fleet. And at one point, they had their ability to actually purchase new ships stripped from them by DHS! 




 I agree completely! Sadly, the Russians have a massive fleet of icebreakers. 

Edit: I was misinformed. 




 The CIWS has numerous delicate cards within it to help with targeting and what not. When the ship would get up to a good speed or even some up on the turbines, the entire ship would vibrate horribly. And those poor cards would shatter in their holders since the vibrations were horrible right above the screws. 




 The Seventh District (which covers South Carolina, Georgia and most of Florida) is one of the busiest districts if not the busiest. Miami and Key West tend to have a lot more cutters. And some of the smaller cutters (87', 110') are sometimes homeported in small towns.  




 I'll see if I can find some over the next few days :) 




 I've noticed that there are still a few cutters missing. Things like the USCGC Vise and the USCGC Joshua Appleby. I'll do some more digging when I get home. 




 There is a list! It's the [USCG Light List](http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/?pageName=lightlists). It includes both federal (USCG Maintained) and private aids. 




 And each tender has a massive AOR! Not to mention that they will go help other tenders if needed. 
























 What. The. Actual. Fuck. 




 It just always makes me happy when the Commander in Chief gives the commencement address at the USCGA 




 Hmmm.... I'm not sure then :/ 

I tried it once and like I said, I never put the pad all the way in.  




 Fantastic colorization! 









 It's amazing how quickly our bodies build up a tolerance to alcohol. 




 That is damned impressive! 




 I remember my "friends" didn't want to be around me as I worked on getting sober. Mostly because my "Friends" all hung out at the bar. SO, I feel that I'm better off without them. 




 That would be the [USCGC Ridley](http://www.uscg.mil/d1/sectlis/units/cgcRidley/) in the foreground.

87' Coastal Patrol Boat (Marine Protector Class) homeported at [USCG Station Montauk](http://www.uscg.mil/d1/staMontauk/) located on Long Island, New York. 




 That's fantastic! Some people are able to keep it under control. Sadly for me, when I could down 18 longnecks in a night and not feel a buzz of any kind, I knew I might have a problem. 




 Good for you.  




 That's a hell of a wake up. I'm sorry that you had to go through that. 




 That's my reasoning as well. I can give up alcohol, but I don't want to loose my daughter. 




 I've been sober from alcohol for 3 years now. I got sober because I was facing the prospect of loosing all contact with my child. 




 This can be to alcohol, drugs, anything that you were once addicted to. 




 The one issue I had was that you're supposed to insert the pad completely in. I've always had an issue with that and never got it all the way in. In theory, what's supposed to happen is any liquid, the pad absorbs and expands, blocking you up completely. At some point your bod will force it out but I've never been comfortable with inserting it all the way. It's supposed to be one hell of a mind-fuck though as your body feels the need to expel, the pad blocks it and absorbs some. 




 Indeed! And I was stationed on that ship for 3 years :) 




 I still have yet to answer it O_o 




 Phew! It's all good :D 









 I was under the impression that the stem was the seam where the bow met. 




 Cross posted from /r/schweiz  














 This was taken during the drydock period of 2004 in Oakland, CA. 









 That's good to know! Our Fire Control guys gave me that reason, so like all good things, I took their word as true with no fact checking on my part 




 I've only seen it successfully fired once and it was pretty damn a awesome. The loudest I've ever heard was the MK-75 76mm canon that was on the bow. Either that or the MK38 Mod 2 




 I would love to see more! 




 Lol. It's quite alright! 




 I do find it fitting that I would post a pic of said CIWS after making that comment. 





























 I'm not certain. I'll see what I can find when I get home and I'll PM you the details 




 You could always move to Switzerland :P 




 Am I the only one bothered by the fact that the stanchions and lifelines are flat on the deck?

 I'm here to offer knowledge about the US Coast Guard :) 




 This was taken during the deployment of Expeditionary Strike Group Five (ESG 5) in 2004 














 It's a train car... of beer. 









 That was fantastic! 




 lmao. I laughed harder at that than I should have. 




 So let it goooooo!!!! 




 Clearly not!  




 I know ours (USCG) harkens back to the days of the Revenue Cutter Service. I pulled this from [uscg.mil](http://www.uscg.mil):

The Revenue Marine and the Revenue Cutter Service , as it was known variously throughout the late 18th and the 19th centuries, referred to its ships as cutters.  The term is English in origin and refers to a specific type of vessel, namely, "a small, decked ship with one mast and bowsprit, with a gaff mainsail on a boom, a square yard and topsail, and two jibs or a jib and a staysail." (Peter Kemp, editor, The Oxford Companion to Ships   the Sea; London: Oxford University Press, 1976; pp. 221-222.)   The Royal Navy's definition of a cutter was a small warship capable of carrying 8 to 12 cannons.*** 

By general usage, the term cutter came to define any vessel of Great Britain's Royal Customs Service and the term was adopted by the U.S. Treasury Department at the creation of what would become the Revenue Marine.  Since that time, no matter what the vessel type, the service has referred to its largest vessels as cutters (today a cutter is any Coast Guard vessel over 65-feet in length).

And the little addition as denoted by "***":

***BMC Joseph Noecker, USCG (Ret.) in an email to the Historian's Office, noted: ". . .cutters in the British man-of-war designations had 8 to 12 guns/cannon. . . Hull numbers [were] one way of calling a ship via radio.  Much the same as an aircrafts' tail number is used today.  By international agreement all U.S. radio call signs begin with A, K, N or W.  Army (and later Air Force) used A, Navy and private aircraft use N.  That, among other reasonings, may have been the reason for the W."

 It's all good. Still an amazing game. 




 Indeed! 




 Cards Against Humanity with all possible expansions and packs. It offers so much in the way of variety and usually leaves people [in stitches](http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/in+stitches). 




 Jenny? 




 Or the Emperor let himself go! 




 I was watching The Living Daylights (James Bond Film) and she was featured in the opening scene. 









 I love what you've done to abuniverse! This is an incredible transformation and I can't wait to place some orders in the future!     




 I keep mine well trimmed. I don't like shaving as it itches like mad a day after. I use the sideburn bit on my electric razor to trim everything. I will shave my balls with shaving cream and a razor in the shower though. 




 I readjust and tuck it downwards a bit. I also usually wet my diaper shortly thereafter and it helps reduce said boner. 




 Those look amazing! I felt myself starting to slip into littlespace just looking at them! WANT!

Also, you're rather adorable in your Snuggies XD 




 Here's a thread about them: http://defence.pk/threads/ccg-2901-and-ccg-2501.346531/.

Former Coastie here and I love seeing various Coast Guard (or Coastguard) ships of the world. 




 The internal politics of the management. My manager doesn't answer to any of the GMs in the area, but they don't like him. So they take it out on us.  




 They sort of remind me of Gremlins... 
























 For us, it was something along the lines of "The weather decks are now secure to all hand. The smoking lamp is lit in the DC shop."

As for announcing rough seas, they never really did that as the motion of the ship was usually enough to tell you when things were going to be getting worse. 




 I will do that! Thank you :) 




 I will do that! Thank you :) 




 Even at it's worse, there was never a "We may not survive this" feeling. For the most part, everything was ops normal, but more vomit. And this wasn't even the worse that we saw that patrol. There were concerns for those out on the deck, but when those concerns arose, the CO secured the weather decks (basically no one goes out). But it was actually easier for those at the helm as they could see the horizon. That's the key. When you feel sea sick, put your eyes on the horizon as it gives you a sense of stability and  your body can acclimate.  




 It was beautiful and terrifying at the same time. Of course most of the crew spent a good portion of their time sick... 









 I will! 




 Thank you so much for your help! 




 There in lies the rub. I no longer own the camera. It was dropped into the ocean on my last patrol back in 2005. I've still got all of the exif days on the pictures but the camera is long gone. 




 Mother nature is a powerful force 




 Thank you! 




 It was a rough ride though! 




 Perhaps, but I still find it beautiful 














 That's amazing! 




 Thank you! 




 Thank you! 




 Fantastic! Thank you very much!

Do you know if that $55 would cover future photography as well? 




 My concern is the cost. Would I have to register each photo or just the fact that I took a large group of photos? 




 I have recently started posting some images I took years ago to reddit (as can be seen in my history). As I understand it, because I am the photographer, the copyright is inherently mine. Recently, I found a website was taking images directly from a subreddit and rehosting them on their own site. Twice I asked the site admin to remove my images and both times they have complied. However, this last time, they responded demanding that I provide proof of ownership of the images. I'm wondering if I should watermark each image and how to protect myself and my IP in the future with these images. Any advice is welcome. If I don't respond right away, chances are I'm asleep as I work overnights.

Thank you for your time and assistance.

 That is a beautiful shot 




 We were deployed with the navy and ESG5 back in 2004-2005. After the deployment, instead of going back through the Pacific, we proceeded up through the Suez, with a stop in Jordan first.  









 No matter how much I've searched, I can't find an importer anywhere in the states :/ 




 It was amazing when I was there. I remember at one point going somewhere and we turned and found the [Alpine Cheese Festival](http://www.myswitzerland.com/en-us/events/event-29543533.html). It was amazing! I want to go back soooooo bad . 




 I had such a blast there! I want to go back so badly

 A good, sound investment! 




 Thank you :D 




 We were able to get permission to circumnavigate the globe after our deployment with the Navy. The rest of the Strike Group went back home through the Pacific and we continued up through the Suez and into the Med. 




 That's fantastic! Where abouts in Utah? Mostly just curious as I'll be driving through there in the near future. 




 I drank the whole bottle which is one dose (10 oz / ~296mL) 




 I've used it a couple of times. The first time, I didn't know what I was getting myself into. I was light headed, dizzy and just drained. The second time, I kept hydrated, made sure to eat and just take it easy. I went through quite a few diapers that day. But, even the following few days, my body was not happy and I was passing everything in an unpleasant fashion. If you're looking for loss of control, it's great. I held it until my body just noped and forced the mess into my diaper. Just remember to stay hydrated and eat. And also be prepared for a rough couple of days after as your body adjusts.

7/10 would recommend but very very sparingly. 




 Yay! 




 I love your surveys! Plz can I haz moar? 









 I do believe they are!  









 lol :D 




 It's one of those little things most people don't know until you're dealing with it in a professional setting. I wouldn't worry too much about the title as the point is still conveyed :) 




 This will probably get me downvoted, but when a ship strikes a stationary object, it's an allision. A collision is between two moving vessels. As someone who's dealt with this type of thing before (albeit not on this scale), the Coast Guard makes the distinction. And then both vessels get to deal with the Coast Guard's paperwork! Fun! Nothing like an investigation! 




 I've got a few ships from this transit! I'll keep an eye out for the banner! 














 I love this photo with the house in the foreground and the mountains in the back. It just feels... right. 









 I'm only subscribed because it's a default and I have yet to unsubscribe! 




 I picked this one up in Alameda (back when our homeport was there :) ) 




 I've considered retiring to there. 




 Glad to offer bits of knowledge! And that is a good joke. Another is "Why must you be 6 feet tall to join the Coast Guard? So when the boat sinks you can walk back to shore." .

The one ship I was on had a flight deck and a hangar and we ran helo ops for almost every patrol. 




 For me, I've been sober for 3 years now, so it's not something I've been trying to hard to look into. I do remember loving the discovery of the Hefeweizen. 




 This was taken with a little Fujifilm digital camera. It's one I picked up at the Exchange before deployment which is also, now at the bottom of the ocean. 




 Fun fact in that I can answer both!

I was part of the Burial at Sea crew on the USCGC Munro during my tour. There were typically 4 crew members for the honor guard. The CO presided over the Ceremony with the XO acting as his assistant. Mostly the XO held the urn until it was time to hand it to the CO. That and get coated in ash that one time the wind changed direction. It was always a somber occasion and it's lead me to consider burial at sea as my choice of burial.

As for the interdictions, any USCG vessel (small boat included) can perform them. We derive our general Law Enforcement authority from 14 U.S.C. 2. [Here's the Office of Law Enforcement's Webpage.](http://www.uscg.mil/hq/cg5/cg531/) Additional US Codes give further authorities. As a Petty Officer, I had the ability to act as a Law Enforcement Officer (as per [14 U.S. Code  89](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/14/89)). As long as the vessel is flying the Coast Guard Ensign, it has the full authority of the US Coast Guard behind it. Fun fact! When you hear about a US Navy ship making a drug bust, there's a high probability that a US Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachment (LEDET) on board and the ship will shift it's TACON (Tactical Control) to the US Coast Guard. This is because the US Navy doesn't have the same authorities as the USCG. On the other hand the USCG becomes a part of the Department of the Navy during times of war. 




 Wow. Instead of bitching, there's always voat. 




 The immensity of it all is staggering 




 Oh gosh. This photo was taken back in 2003. All I really remember from that time was a lot of sea sickness. 





























 You could try /r/HeavySeas. For ships, there's /r/WarshipPorn 




 This was taken approx 210 NM off of the coast of Alaska in the Bearing Sea during one of the summer storms. 









 How closely does NOAA and NMFS work with the US Coast Guard with regards to releasing rehabilitated turtles and anything else that might threaten turtles? 




 AutoMod has been revamped and should be able to do this. 




 Yep! 




 Not to be confused with the rotten Desert Bluffs!

 Most of his stuff is royalty free, but I know of a song being posted to here later today that if you wish to use it for commercial purposes, it's like $5 to purchase the song.

 Yep! 




 I shall look into that!

Thank you :) 




 Where would you recommend someone ,who has had their love of space rekindled, start to learn more about space and the amazing wonders that are waiting out there?

 Here's the best way to determine if you're an AB.

Do you identify as an AB?

Survey says:

I consider me not being an AB just a DL.

I think if anything you're a DL who's interested in the AB side of things. But that's just my two cents.  




 I always hated wearing Trops (Tropical Blue Long) and standing at Attention/Parade Rest like a damned ornament. Especially when we would pull in. 




 I don't think the bear would do so well inside of the vibe :P 




 I am strangely turned on by it but still find it a bit odd to be honest. Is it for both male and female? 




 I appreciate the thought! Mostly, I like to post pics from the Coast Guard :) 




 I've been hanging out on /r/schweiz and /r/WarshipPorn lately.  




 Mostly the ones in the sidebar. /r/abdlstories, /r/DudesInDiapers, /r/GirlsInDiapers, sometimes, /r/babyfurs and /r/littlespace. 




 It does work I will give it that. But it's also becoming a place where I don't really want to waste an hour of my life as things get all backstaby. 




 While difficult at first, it does get easier and you'll find you start to relate with bits and pieces. You'll never truly identify with one person as everyone's experiences are slightly different, but you'll start to see themes that are present in your own life.  




 They are helpful! Stay strong and remember, one day at a time. 




 Hi. My name is /u/test_subject1730 and I'm an alcoholic. I've been in Alcoholic Anonymous  for damn near 3 years now. The program is helpful but still full of shit at the same time. I've never been in a bigger real life circlejerk before, but it has helped me stay sober. Everyday I struggle with not drinking and I know that there are people I can call if it gets bad that have been there and can talk me down from the ledge, as it were. People talk about addiction to numerous drugs, but a lot of people forget the powerful effects that alcohol has and that it too is just as powerful of a demon as many illicit substances.  




 The map really helps a lot! It was amusing to see the collective blinding of /r/WarshipPorn with the first graphic. Fantastic work though! 




 It's fantastic to see you post this here! :D

Amazing work as always!

 Just got my sample pack the other day and love it! I remembered why I loved Cushies and plan on ordering a case shortly! I'm still waiting to try the rearz spoiled and saving it for a day off to enjoy it properly!

 Might I suggest cross posting this to /r/uscg. I think they would like it. 




 I'm going through the Percy Jackson series again. You know... When I'm not working or moving. 




 Even if the CSS is implemented to make is no participation, it's easy to turn that off. And since this sub has very light CSS, it's not really going to change much other than the header and flair. All you need is RES and you can disable the subreddit style and bam. No more issue with the no participation mode.

 I need to find a good meeting up here and get back in the program. 




 Today marks three years of sobriety for me. It's not been an easy journey. I started in AA but never really jumped into the program. I mostly talked to people. That helped me more than I thought it would. At first, I just listened. I didn't really feel like I belonged. ***I*** didn't have a problem with alcohol. ***I*** wasn't like these people here. But as time went on, I kept going to meetings. At one point I was gifted a copy of the big book. I've still got it, but haven't read it all that much. Mostly I just listened. And as time went on, I started to identify with a bit from this person or something from that person. I started to see similarities in me. I remember when it all clicked. On that day, I stood up and said "Hi. I'm Brent, and I'm an alcoholic." On that day, I chose to give up drinking completely. Three years later and I haven't had a drop of alcohol. Oh, I've been tempted so much over that time. I thought time would diminish the urge and desire to drink and it has... to a point. But I have had days where I wanted to do nothing more than drown my sorrows in a bottle. And those days happen more than I would like. To quote the big book: 
 Remember that we deal with alcohol, cunning, baffling, powerful.

I know I'm tempted nearly every day. But I've made it this far. You can too. 




 I've removed your post because of that. However, if you can find an alternate source, please feel free to resubmit. 




 The Mighty Morg!

I do miss being underway.  




 If I had to guess, I would think that an announcement about SWTOR was made at E3 




 About 2.5 years. Had a blast though and spent the rest of my career trying to get back out to sea. 




 USCGC Munro (WHEC-724) 




 Yep 




 Thankfully, unless it was at night, it was pretty easy to be rescued. At night though, you're fucked 




 It was awe inspiring.  




 Indeed! 




 Yes!!!! The good old Funro. I was on there from 2002-2005 




 It's fun though! 




 Sounds General Quarters! 




 Yet on the calmest of days, it's absolutely amazing 




 As terrifying as it can be, I miss being out to sea 




 If it was a gif, it would have featured me vomiting shortly after 
























 I have removed this post because while this is a lovely post, it doesn't quite fit with the theme of Thalassophobia.  




 And we're working hard to try and squash the reposts that don't meet the three month criteria. Each submission is now being reviewed by a mod and while it might take a bit of time, we do check every post to see if it is a repost. However, there are some that we miss. If you find a repost, please report it to us. It will add weight to our final decision. 




 I agree completely and that's what we're going for. I feel that the subtle outline of something seen from the corner of your eye adds so much to a photo of the ocean. And even some animals in general, but this sub is quickly becoming /r/sharkweek and /r/seacreatures. We're hoping to find a happy medium between the two. 









 I agree. For critters there is always /r deepseacreatures and /r/TheDepthsBelow. 




 Hello everyone! Recently we've seen an influx of animals being posted to /r/thalassophobia that aren't really thalassophobia inducing. Starting Monday, 27 July 2015, we will begin a week-long trial of removing most animal posts. We understand that some sea creatures are central to some people's thalassophobia and those that fit into that grouping will be allowed. However, photos and videos of just sea creatures with no explanation for the fear it can induce will be removed. During our trial run, all posts will be reviewed with more scrutiny. As usual, please note the rules in the sidebar with regards to reposts. If you're looking to see when the last time a picture was posted, I would recommend using [KarmaDecay](https://www.karmadecay.com) and even just reddit's simple search function can help. If you find something violating the rules please use the report button and let us know. We do review each report and take appropriate actions.

Thank you.

Edit: We now have a button in the sidebar to view posts that have been deemed Exemplary 




 While this is nice, I've removed it as it doesn't fit into the category of thalassophobia.

 I'll be talking to the other mods about this and seeing what we can do to curtail the amount of creature posts on here.

 It appears that you've been shadowbanned. I would recommend you [contact the admins](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Freddit.com) about it. 




 Cat. 









 Might I suggest a cross post to /r/schweiz?

 Hi there. It appears you've been shadow banned. I would contact reddit admins about it. 




 I know we can as long as the hanger is rolled back. We almost did that with the navy on deployment 




 Always nice to see another Coastie on here! I spent three years on the Munro 




 I loved being on a 378. I miss being out to sea. 




 Fantastic guide 









 Hey, there. Thanks for posting. However, I've removed this post due to the following reason:

 **If thine link is already in the Hall Of Fame in the sidebar.** 














 He has lost a considerable amount of weight. I remember him taking about it on the nerdist podcast once.
