 Yeah! :) 




 Yeah, It happen in Normals too, but in like 9/10 ARAM I loose they say GG EASY xD. Its still nice to win, even if its only ARAM :) 




 Too bad you can't do this over the portal in survival -_- 




 LOL in every game I loose ARAM, the other team say GG Easy. Hate it... 




 This happend for me too bro. Lost 200+ LP. We lost almost every game due too leavers and flamers. In bronze, players think they gonna loose if enemy gets first blood or they are 4 kills after. Just if they dont flame and stay positive you can get some wins again. :)

 I does only use one monitor atm.

I have just reinstalled windows on my pc. Mby thats why i had so much FPS? 




 Hello!

just got myself an Asus 144hz gaming monitor. I enabled 144hz refresh rate in Windows and on my Nvidia 680 graphic card. But when I started LOL the FPS is very unstable. It is spiking from 70 to 144 fps every second. Making the game a pain to play. My settings ingame does not matter. With everything on low I get LESS FPS, from 60 to 80 fps. I have tried vSync, FPS cap, every setting. Repairing the game.

I got a good pc having constant over 400 fps, a few patches ago.

Does anyone have the same problem?

Edit: Just fixed it! The problem was the "Enable HUD Animations" option. I just disabled it and now I have stable 144FPS.

Thanks to the League of Legends forum user "Zyvera" for posting this fix! 




 must say that it was... **beast**. Batum Tss
