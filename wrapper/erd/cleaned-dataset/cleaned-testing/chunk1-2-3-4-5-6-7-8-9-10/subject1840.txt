 This art looks rather like 100% real TVshop ad. I don't asses scientific side of the thing but ultimaeye website could for sure in tvshop. And this link in reddit has value = 17.5 kupvotes X $5.99 per/app (FOR LIMITED TIME ONLY) = 104.825$ . Not so bad for this type of marketing. 

















































 to be honest guys this thing doesn't look like 3D printer - I would say it's an old plotter
so next guy can hack 3D printer for ping pong player and beat the Chinese  














 doesn't work :( 




 I prefer castAR - for the price and the technology  









 soon will be available live satvideo - you can archive it for yourself  




 shouldn't  we ban this f...ing manufactures? 
they just try to put their hand deeper in our pocked in way we don't noticed this 




 28 hours to go 





























 try to hold you breath for 5 min to discover what your body have to say about safeness of CO2. 




 CO2 from fizzy drink finally end up in your liver after pass the guts. And than start making trouble for breathing cells. CO2 is  a bit toxic so better drink it flat. 




 You have still big problem with rising concentration of carbon dioxide in you lungs - what make you filling like you are drowning. 




 Remember Marcin, you have to develop extract process for it! You could say: look how much we have hydrogen in the oceans let use it us clean energy for good of all mankind!  But devil siting in details. 




 bravo, we support you! 




 I assume you aren't farm boy - so, you should be very careful before you make you decision how you going to do farm work (unless it recreation farm). 
After my graduation I used to be an organic farmer and most important lesson I'd learn was that you don't need PhD or graduation to do this job even more this is mostly useless balance and even simpleton farm boy was much better on this area then me.  
Really small changes what, how, and when you doing could have really big impact for effects.
How to start?  Every thing depend what you decided to growing on your farm, will be this some sort of organic, permaculture production?

I don't want to criticized Marcin's achievement (they did great job) but their farming set isn't ready yet - first you couldn't do all sort of farming jobs on your fields, second: as I came a cross information from replicants, tractor need some sort of repairing wheels after less then 20 miles of run on the road (where it have much less to do than on the field) - (if I'm wrong or miss understanding some info: Marcin, please correct me quickly). I hope they are going to test this sets on the their fields this year - it's spring perfect time for that. And if you couldn't count on some donations you have to concentrate on production where efficiency is the master.
Building community - that's very interesting but much more complicated then starting farming from scratch. Believe me, even here I got my own experience (my idea to organic farming doesn't come from blue sky).

If you interesting in subjects I only just touched, let me know - I'll be more then happy to help you.
 




 it's not necessary to be such negative dude! 
Do you like to give strong, controversial opinion with little knowledge about subject? 




 Marcin, I got a question about microhouse - why you guys make so complicated carpentry job for it? I hope you still here and in the future you will be able to spare couple hours per week/month/or something   for little chat like today. I have to add I appreciate what you done however in some points I got different opinions. 




 I'm sorry for that. Several years ago I had accident at work - I lose a finger tip. The worst thing was when docs wanted cat off half of the rest - to make me better - treating me that later they will amputate whole. I refused. After 2-3 weeks I went back to work. 
I;m afraid your father hand will be  very, very over sensitive. Up to 3 years each touch this place is really unpleasant.  



















 What is sens for virus to carry antibiotics resistance gen? Attacked cell will be destroyed anyway doesn't matter of antibiotics presence.  




 As far as I now antibiotics works only against bacteria.  For viruses is another class of antivirus drugs. 




 great link thx 
























 yep, it's rare disease and still 40 million Americans suffer from it. So, how many got to suffer to be common illness? 




 So, it's look like for me:  - if you got pain in your foot - they can amputate you leg, if you got headache they can cut your head off. 
Brilliant treatment.  














 you can use this as downlink and 2.5GHz(or so) wireless as uplink cos most of data is downloaded. Speed down on virgin broadband is 30Mbps and up only 2Mbps. Maybe in USA suburbs is not a problem but I got in UK constantly 17 different  wireless in my range and as I remember 2.5GHz band has 11 channels but only 3 are independent. That's mean if you can see more then 3 you have overlapping transmissions. 






















































 but to be honest even now not every one can buy big home - so, small could be usefull ;) 




 you got + from me  to repay  unjustice then

 Let me quote: "In concentrations up to 1% (10,000 ppm), it will make some people feel drowsy.[84] Concentrations of 7% to 10% may cause suffocation, even in the presence of sufficient oxygen, manifesting as dizziness, headache, visual and hearing dysfunction, and unconsciousness within a few minutes to an hour."

 You not afraid to fail? excellent and you have practical "feeling" - wonderful. Than I couldn't find a reason why you shouldn't succeeded.  You invest money and you have right to profits if you doing it wisely.
What is you idea about growing on your fields? 




 so, will you try breath with mix of 20% O2   80% CO2  ?  I don't think you can - rising level of CO2 in you lungs would trigger signal in your brain to make you fill out of breath  - if I not mistaken -  and level of CO2  would killed you.   




 Obviously, it's nothing to be shame about and finished looks really great. What I'm worried about is amount of working hours necessary to spend on it - if someone starting with this business - most important for him is time and money hi must spent on it.  
Having carpenter's and builder's experience I can  recommend to make walls a bit higher (if you want to have upper part of the house) and put the roof on rafters laying just on wooden beams fixed to the top of the highest and smallest walls. And use dimensions of standard sheet you going to put on - will save time for cutting, trimming etc..
So, good luck with module 2. 




 As I remember this guy wanted circa 10k$ for developing this technology - really small amount of money if such profitable industry. Big aluminum companies doesn't use it, that's mean to me building production line won't we easy or cheap and cost of product could be bigger than using imported boxites.
If you succeed with this technology you don't need to wary with the many for development others projects. 




 You forget about all this people with ill liver forbidden to drink fizzy drinks, dude  ;)

But I really appreciate your American sense of humor. 
























 for comparison others 3D technology: http://www.reddit.com/r/3Dvisions/ 
























 Where is your point? 


























































































































































 in theory, in subatomic quantum scale. It's difficult to imagine but trouble comes from the model of reality we have about subatomic particles witch is incomplete for sure. 
























 this what RPi need is better processor and more memory, cos years gone and old stuff is  pretty outdated. 
























 that dogs can sniff out hidden pendrive for example 









 Will be this thing an open source project? 














 Not is this price

 Maybe this sound stupid by way not use regularly lawn mower thru whole vegetative season insted diging 3m deep crater??  







































 I would say this is so called  miranti - cheaper hardwood - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shorea . 

edit: really guys you are right - looks like an oak.  






















































 just read the text 









 The title sounds like a joke. Even for kids is quite obvious that you can electrolyzed water for oxygen and hydrogen by using small battery. What make a different is just type of electrodes that doesn't dissolve in this environment.   


































 Maybe cost of this pesticides is billions of euros but using them could cost much more 




 Pls do it on http://www.reddit.com/r/3Dvisions/ too! 




 slightly delayed but finally great Virtual Reality project found  its way to backers.
I'm not hiding - I'm great fun this technology and I hope it will grow above facebook Oculus competitor 









 Has anyone idea how this rat poison will circulate in environment? Is it biodegradable?  




 Have any one idea how this rat poison will circulate in environment and is it biodegradable? 
























 Geniuses! why so late?
technology isn't, and is very cheap, only lack of people who want to do it

 bad idea - no respect for your readers! Who wanted your changes?
A lots of folks wanted pure tech - RESTORE IT!!!! 




 Look really poor in this days. 
Cheaper and better option arudino clon form China - 2.80 and much more fan. 




 Whole idea behind homeopathy sounds really stupid but my experience and my wife's telling that it could help. And I believe more my experience then  top Aussie Uni research centers. I can take stuff from jungle medicine men but only one condition - got to work properly - doesn't matter reason or theory or ideology. 
One big advantage, it is so diluted that couldn't poison you - many thing from chemist shop really can. 




 Don't be such  puristic - this is about all old world business  




 Send your MEP email what you thinking about it!! 












































 If you will waiting for last minute to cancel your subscription you'll be definitely charged for the first month.
I enrolled and when I tried to cancel udacity several times (!!!) ask me to change my password to make sure it's really me - and all this time curse was on the list. So, if you want to cancel make sure you have half an hour to end of the trial.

I know , my first post was too dramatic   ;))    - just to make some attention for the problem - you know: in murky water easier to catch a fish

and  sorry for my English - it's not my first language 









 This is what I thought. But I couldn't find the link to view that stuff only enroll button where you must give bank account details and if you forget cancel enrollment before 1 week trial is done they will charge you for 1 month - $200.

Any one know a way to view nanodegree without giving bank details?  




 Udacity nanodegree - is it next way to pull money from people who forgot to cancel after they enrolled  and give bank card details? Or is any way to access nano-course materials without banks details? 
Isn't rip off to charge folks $200/month for MOOC? Estimated cost of one MOOC is 100k - 200k $. If will be 100k (as usually) and every one only forgot to cancel that will be profit circa 200M $ !!!???
That's better business than Apple, Google and Microsoft together. 




 I hope you right, I just looking for clear statement from MS. 




 question is: if I update, one year will be free, next year maybe and what later? Will be possibly to switch back to win7 and don't pay for license???!!! 
























 The worst things is forced update whenever you are whatever you do 




 I'm sorry, dud - English is not my first language. My longer sentences could have unexpected results. Do you want me to translate this to plain English??  ;-) 




 to be honest  - don't start to believe in free lunch - Microsoft is  giving  this for free, not because they love us very much but if they not, they would stay by the empty the table with this wonderful software.   It's economy law  - you couldn't expect to take too much for a product above its cost and not loosing  your share of the market. This is how open source had happen. 
Back to VSO - it's good but not quite Carling - just old Microsoft habit to be arrogance with making around UI. Tiles interface had it's go with win8 and failed - it's just like to change one day law and ask drivers to drive on the left hand side of the road (or opposite if you in UK).
Seams to me new CEO understand why open source happened and this is really good even for open source  ;-) 




 Is anyone succeed to try this on? 














 It's perfect evidence for my conception "how is possibly to ride on two wheels" - by using handlebars for keeping balance - not just using gyroscopic effect. Everyone now how to do this but none knows how they do it. Similar situation to learning to walk - baby doesn't have any knowledge how to do a small walk but it have a hint by observing others people that it's possibly than by try and error  method gradually train neurons path to react accordingly  to situation. 
 





























 I closed the window when it open already 10th subpage and I don't want to go back there.

 Thx dud for your wishes if they are honest  :)
I just warn, based on situation I had. 
Did you learn about image optimization? 




 So, how much you got per post??  ;)
Enough for entry fee? 




 how much you payed for it? 




 You sounds like walking ads for that, dud.  May you show us your nanodegree?

 My favorite VR headset is castAR - fianali coming to masses on early 2016 - look on kickstarter: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/technicalillusions/castar-the-most-versatile-ar-and-vr-system

 I just  did mini tut form lifehacker  http://lifehacker.com/disable-ads-on-youtube-by-enabling-a-youtube-experiment-1171802208 but still I got 5s ad on the beginning each video.
I used to have AdBolck but from the moment google started paying ransom to app owner worked much worst. Now new version of firefox filtering quite a lot of this stuff. 




 I hope I wrote clearly my point - however: English isn't my first language. If is something unclear, misspelled or grammar mistakes - let me know, I will edit this post. Thx a lot.

Couple  weeks ago google made announcement in media that youtube got almost any profits. Next day I noticed that on each youtube video instead of usual links to Adwords on bottom of video or clip with option out after 5s, it starts with 5s video clip. 
After couple weeks almost each video started with 20s without option to leave ad. Yesterday I noticed most videos starts with 30s ad clip. Is google testing users patience? I wonder if this is usual treatment or just "personalized search results" made for my user profile. 
 









 That's my favorite stuff I waiting for. 






















































 And this is very , very bad move of Microsoft.
I thought after they give win10 as free udpdate for win7 and 8 users ththat something was changed - but this is only change in tactics big company  :(
