 "because I didn't hear anyone saying any of these in this video? Please, quote me where people have said this." 
I'm sorry but at what point did we relegate this only to the video, you brought up sjw's on tumblr, i assumed we are referencing all instances  including campaigns and instances outside of the video?

"o... do you think that coercion does not count as sexual assault? Because if so, holy shit."

the practice of persuading someone to do something by using force or threats.
"it wasn't slavery because no coercion was used" welp i really used the wrong word in this context, i apologize, i was thinking of persuasion not coercion. It is shown in my original post that the definition i used for coercion does not correlate to how coercion is defined, but yes coercion would be under every definition rape, i agree with this, but persuading your partner to have sex no i do not believe so. 

"Falsely reporting a crime is already a crime. Does falsely reporting rape need to be an extra super special crime? You don't see why this might make people afraid to actually report rapes out of fear that they'll be unfairly accused?"

No it's not, what are you talking about? falsely filing a police report is a crime, falsely reporting a rape even if it is later found not to be true is not remotely criminalized, if you retract your claims they wont charge, if you file a police report, go to court and he is found guilty and later own you retract your statement he will be freed but you still will not get charged, their are actual instances of this occuring, like the highschool football player falsely accused and who went to jail for ten years, while his accuser ended up suing the school district and won, she does not have to repay, the court system has never even attempted to go after her, she got 5 million dollars from the state in tax payers dollars and wasted another couple of thousand by having the state incarcerate an innocent man. 

Wow if you think that false accusations of rapes are actually prosecuted you're extremely delusional. Rape culture, the only culture where men can be accused of rape and immediately have their life ruined yet women still think society is unfairly victimizing rape victims, i think rape is the only crime where a person does not need to provide evidence, testify or show any facts concerning the crime yet somehow their is a high chance the accused will be sent to prison. 

 




 I love this, lets ignore the statement and then ask who is saying this, if i have never heard of it, your point is invalid. Seriously you never heard of the yes does not mean yes campaign? seriously i have a friend in the uk, feminist was telling me rape laws were not inclusive and they need to add more definitions like how being coerced into sex(if your partner badgers you but you don't feel like it, his continued persistence even if you're reluctant) should be considered a form of sexual assault, how regret should be considered valid.

In false accusations should be punished extensively, you can't declare rape is a serious crime and then allow the false reporting of rape to continue, you're making a mockery of rape, you're basically saying rape is the worse crime a woman can endure but it's perfectly fine if another woman lies about rape and deliberately hurting how actual rapes will be treated in the future, has no one ever read a boy cried wolf, same concept applies.

 




 So they did a recent study a few months back, most male on male relations are consensual not forced.  




 But that makes little sense, you're saying that rape culture is based off of men feeling entitled to women's bodies but in reality is the opposite of this, while there are the dbags who think they're Adonises and can get any woman they want, most guys have to work towards just being liked by the average woman, that's why men who can repeatedly have sex with women are seen as an example of something to emulate and admire.

The pickup artist crowd, the guys like the dude who shot up that school because women did not pay attention to him, those are the jerks who believe they're entitled to women by right of being a man, but you can go up to any guy, say wanna have sex and they will feel like they won the lottery and are at that moment king of the world.

 




 Call bullshit, the new world made Spain the most envied nation in Europe, everybody wanted a piece of that pie.  




 Proxy implies we were fighting on behalf of another power, ie France or Spain, both allies in the revolution, which is not factual, in fact France wanted and believed it would gain territory after the war ended(been awhile since I looked this up) but we kind of screwed them over when we made peace with general Cornwallis.  




 Why would Tunisia care? Hannibal barca was Carthaginian which were a Phoenician people, Phoenicia was in modern day Lebanon where their descendants(estimated to be around 20% of the population) reside, their closet relatives would be the Hebrews(ancient Hebrew/Phoenician languages were mutually intelligible, the kingdom of Israel and Phoenicia formed a trading empire together, both were conquered by Assyria and their is speculation that Hebrew writing script derives from Phoenician) so in reality Lebanon and possibly Israel?

Would be the ones not amused. 




 They already do dbag, this guys is more humanized then you treat the israeli's? what about the decades the israeli's have suffered, the lynched soldiers in ramallah? the jews beat and killed for being jews? the israeli's are not the dehumanizing aspects.  




 Yeah i know but i thought it added to the overall title it's more of a play on the struggle is real meme. 




 Palestinian hamas leader khaled meshaal is currently suffering from the trauma,exhaustion and pressure of being the leader of an oppressed, besieged people during the recent war of israeli zionist occupation and aggression. Here he is currently sitting in a gym in nice part of Qatar as another ceasefire was horribly broken by Israel after the brave and glorious  martyr's of the Palestinian captured an Israeli soldier for the first time since this conflict began. 32 Palestinian people have been killed so far in this recent flare up. Please spread this, pray for the innocent gazans and this horribly oppressed leader. The world can not stay blind to the oppressed people of Palestine and their elected officials. LOOK AT THAT BELLY THE MAN IS STARVING! 









 The last time israel allowed in constructions material was about a year ago, they used it to build a terror tunnel into israel. These are the same people who used piping and waste to build rockets.  




 I'm talking about the second intifida.  




 Listen my bad. I get what you're saying the narrative of a freedom fighter is someone else's terrorist is a great point. Even in america after they won the war of independence which we in the us consider the great american revolution many slaves who would of been granted freedom 40 years earlier then they did under if not right after the war had Britain won i'm sure probably consider the american patriots terrorist. Hell the op himself considers the political establishment a problem but believes the military wing are freedom fighters. I can cite the fact they deliberately target kids but he will consider them always to be patriots for their national cause. 

I get that. I understand. I'm just saying from my perspective on why i do not even looking from a Palestinian narrative could consider them either political or paramilitary wise freedom fighters. But that's just my  opinion. In no i'm not an Israeli, i'm an american from chicago southside. Don't want to go into details but lets just say, my mom would of slapped me had i not voted for obama in 2012 lolz. Honestly if i was an israeli... ok not going to say it might just come of as propaganda or biased but if you want look up the israeli left side of the conflict. It seems the jews by and large are more pro-pali then pro-israel so eh. But anyway have a nice day.   




 Bro you need to read the context of my post before spouting off. You clearly posted a point about kids writing their names on missiles then inferred they would be targeted at kids like them, which is not the case. Those missiles are not being targeted for children but Hamas(in the kids who die are not intentional, not even the most biased news sources state such things, unless you live in switzerland or something more then likely you know what collateral deaths are don't try to act like everything that occurs in war is completely intentional), while i may not agree with the idea of pride in your national military forces or patriotism it's entirely common for kids to be taught as such. Them signing their names is nothing different then us pilots marking jet fighters with naked women or writing slogans on their tanks, yes the inner leftist in me thinks why would you be proud of a weapon of war but we know how morale goes in any conflict. Anyway you generalized both sides hate each other, i was trying to show you by the humanitarian rights orgs(many of which are anti-israel government) such as btselem is that's not the actual case.

If i wanted to be a propagandist instead i would post vids from the idf youtube channel showing them sending food to gaza and the great humanitarian programs israel has, telling you about the stories of hamas pm grand daughter being allowed into israel for medical treatment instead i made a simple point about the conflict not being black and white. 

Secondly i never claimed they did not exist. As we understand now the Palestinian Arab people do exist, rather or not this is historically factual matters little. More then 7 million people believe they're Palestinians so they're Palestinians. In the historical context though and the origins of the national identity is what i was referring to. Secondly i never claimed any such thing jesus read my reddits correctly.

"Hamas never called ahead before sending a terrorist (not a fucking freedom fighter)
Seriously dude, it depends on perspective who is a terrorist or a freedom fighter. You are only seeing it from your perspective, try to see from other perspectives.

Ok lets look at this from the arab perspective. I'm a lesbian secular christian Palestinian arab, hamas is a radical islamist organization made up of mostly males between 20-60 with their leadership effectively 40-60 year old conservative religious males. Now please explain to me as a lesbian female living under a radical islamist government, how are they fighting for my freedom to be a lesbian and secular let alone my rights as a woman?"


I was making a point about rather or not hamas can be considered freedom fighters and if so who's freedom are they fighting for. To sunni's in iraq the isil caliphate could be considered freedom fighters but to their fellow shia they're barbaric terorrist whereas to some sunni these guys are nothing but pure thugs etc. Please understand context.

No need to insult me friend. BTW if i was a propogandist i would not put "zion" in my name. That kind of gives me away as a mossad israeli puppet who is trying to promote propoganda:)

 




 Explain to me one good thing they have accomplished then in concerns to the freedom of the Palestinian people? in your point makes no since, how are they fighting for my freedom if i am a Palestinian and apart of these people. How are they representing me? any body can say they fight for the people hell china's army is called the People's liberation army does not mean people in tibet feel liberated. Yeah but here's the difference, even  the worst extremist in israel like lets irgun/lehi who's members like begin later became israel's pms.

Begin for instance was an extremist going by a narrative he could be considered a heroic freedom fighter or a terrorist. But his actions deliberately attributed to the modern israeli state, a state in which he as pm ended the between israel,egypt and jordan. A state where now arabs can live in a secular democracy albeit they're still problems but this state does have equality. If hamas is to be called freedom fighters whose freedom are they for?  




 Wait i can get paid? for being pro israel? really now? how much? are you offering? unlike you moron i'm pro-palestine/pro-israel zionist from chicago. I'm on here because i believe in peace but you seem to be biased all around and promote a agenda. How much does pallywood pay you?  









 http://www.btselem.org/
Bullshit they're hundreds of israeli ngo's name one arab ngo that supports or has sympathy for the israeli's in then you can tell me they both hate each other. Ever heard of chomsky,feinstein?mondoweiss? why are jews the main ones calling for peace and yet the arabs call for deaths of jews?

Look at this. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_of_Peace_massacre
The perpetrator was Jordanian Army Corporal Ahmed Daqamseh, who stated that he attacked because he was insulted and angered that the girls were whistling and clapping while he was praying.[12][1]

Speaking on Al Jazeera in May 2001, Daqamseh's mother said, "I am proud of my son, and I hold my head high. My son did a heroic deed and has pleased Allah and his own conscience. My son lifts my head and the head of the entire Arab and Islamic nation. I am proud of any Muslim who does what Ahmad did. I hope that I am not saying something wrong. When my son went to prison, they asked him: 'Ahmad, do you regret it?' He answered: 'I have no regrets.' He treated everyone to coffee, honored all the other prisoners, and said: The only thing that I am angry about is the gun, which did not work properly. Otherwise I would have killed all of the passengers on the bus.  




 http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-25518813 

Russians are saying. He died of aids ha just kidding but poison is proven to be false. Died of old age. Don't trust wiki it's heavily biased.  




 Bullshit op. Before the infitida you could travel to the west bank you fucked up by supporting hamas. 

 




 This no offense to the op but obviously skewed info. The Sabra and Shatila massacre was the slaughter of between 762 and 3,500 civilians, mostly Palestinians and Lebanese Shiites, by the Kataeb Party, a Lebanese Christian militia, in the Sabra neighborhood and the adjacent Shatila refugee camp in Beirut, Lebanon from approximately 6:00 pm 16 September to 8:00 am 18 September 1982.

It was christian phalangist not sharon. Op please don't be biased. In he is a refugee due to the refusal of lebanon to make him a citizen.

In there were weapons next to the kid.  




 Because this aid ship was not really an aid ship but basically a militant organization, the commandos were armed with paintball guns and got horribly ambushed and beat by these "activist" don't believe the media hype it's all lies. 

Anyway israel allowed gaza in tons of concrete and they built a terror tunnel. Now they're allowing it in. http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/10/14/israel-blocks-construction-materials-from-gaza-after-terror-tunnel-discovery/
http://www.jta.org/2014/01/26/news-opinion/israel-middle-east/israel-to-allow-more-construction-material-into-gaza
 




 This is even worse. It ignores the simple fact even when it was not a jewish state you had conflict, go back to the nebu musa riots of the 1920's and the hebron massacre. Israel has 1.2 million israeli arabs, many of these people are sitting on the knesset like haneen zoabi yet she campaigns for the destructing of israel never mind she is only allowed to speak due to the jewish democracy. An arab majority state(not being racist) would be crap, not only for the arabs but for the jews also.

They would immediately vote on a constitution based somewhat on islamic principles and beliefs basically sharia law. The democracy would be a majority democracy, which is inherently flawed. Look at rome, look at how dictators like Caesar and before him sulla. They used the mob to their advantage to cause chaos and control the senate. Later own in america our forefathers realizing this decided against a democracy in favor of a republic. 

Allowing the arabs to control israel would not only effectively end israel it would end the jewish homeland ideals, the main point of israel is to be a jewish state free of persecution of jews and centuries of anti-semitism. This state would probably end up being a theocracy like iran or end up a corrupt nation under a dictatorship like syria or egypt. Secondly israel agreed to the partition plan(it was not offered by the arabs but the un) which would be multi-ethnic. The arabs refused.  




 Sorry but that does not add up to facts. The arabs decimated their own greenhouses and economic prosprity, then they later beg the jews to help them run the new green houses. The arabs always get second chances and they f up.

Um no allot of anti-semitism exist from the pro palestine crowd. In they don't mean the jews. http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/story/2011-09-13/palestinian-israeli-jews-future-state-israel-PLO/50394882/1

Especially in the west this jew hatred continues by arab immigrants.  




 The rest was owned by the british,turks or absentee arab land owners. If your grand dad has a certificate, talk to an israeli ngo, bring it to the supreme court, it's chaired by a israeli arab(i believe a muslim or druze). If it's valid you can move back. This is what 90% of arabs like to ignore, israel has a proper justice system, the israeli's also keep plots of land open for arab land owners in jerusalem or parts of israel i believe. At worse you may need to simply accept compensation. 




 It's really complicated, they don't wanna give Palestinians passport cause they want them to go back to their country. Palestinians in Lebanon don't even have the right to own anything or even work in public fields... You can read more about this online.. its really terrible.."

Scroll up this is from another palestenian user from lebanon, lebanon refues them citizenship, career access and other basics that could help improve their situation so that they can continuously be used as a way to keep international opinion against israel at the same time keep their populaces distracted from what they do that's usually even worse. Look it up.  




 This is  the part where gazan bias comes in. Israel never stole your water. Israel is the reason the region has water. The gas they speculated and found is there gas. You can have tourist from the egyptian side but they refuse to open the border. Israel stole your sand? seriously 0-0


Because the coastal plain of Judea samaria had few water resources, Theodor Herzl already envisioned the transfer of water from the Jordan River to the coast for irrigation and drinking water supply. In order to realize that Zionist vision, the water company Mekorot was created in 1937, more than a decade before the creation of the state of Israel. In the first two decades of Israel's existence, substantial financial resources were dedicated to create the National Water Carrier, a complex water supply system including the Shiloach Pipeline along the Burma Road to Jerusalem built during the 1948 ArabIsraeli War, a first pipeline to the Negev in 1955 and the transfer of water from the Sea of Galilee in 1964. Furthermore Mekorot began a Rain Enhancement program in 1961, increasing rainfall by 13%-18%. Also, a Brackish Water Pipeline was completed in 1965 to divert brackish ground water from infiltrating the Sea of Galilee.

Water reclamation (1970s and 80s)[edit]


Drinking water being collected by hand in Neot Mordechai c. 1947
In 1969 the Shafdan wastewater treatment plant south of Tel Aviv was completed to treat approximately 130 million cubic meters of wastewater per year for reuse in agriculture. However, wastewater from other cities and towns remained largely untreated. In 1970 there was a cholera outbreak because of illegal irrigation of salad with untreated wastewater. This gave rise to major investments in wastewater treatment under the National Sewerage Plan, which emphasized the reuse of treated wastewater. In 1984 the Kishon wastewater treatment plant was completed in Northern Israel, It provides 20 million cubic meters of treated wastewater per year for agricultural use in the fertile Jezreel Valley, maximizing distribution potential during high-demand periods.

Signing of water sharing agreements (1990s)[edit]
The 1995 Interim Agreement as part of the Oslo Peace Process provided certain quantities of water to the Palestinians, but prevents them from drilling any new wells in the Mountain Aquifer. The surface water of the Jordan River remains disputed with Syria, Lebanon and the Palestinians. Only with Jordan Israel was able to reach an agreement on the sharing of water resources in 1995 as part of the Israel-Jordan Peace Treaty. 

Israel provided the water in the first place. A full decade before the creation of israel. No offense but you guys refused oslo and israel still gives you their water.

 This is ignorant af. First off the jews never came to anyone's land and told them to go. The original zionist bought the land from absentee turkish/arab land owners, the majority of the land outside of that belonged to the british authority. Even know arabs still sell land and are prosecuted(even killed) for doing it. The average arab "land" owners living in the land was irreverently small to be a joke. Actually yes. Arabs like haj amin husseini recruited for the waffen ss gathering bosnian muslimss divisions, the ss were the main jew hunters in eastern europe. He was so successful by the end of ww2 it was 60% non german.  




 Ok lets look at this from the arab perspective. I'm a lesbian secular christian Palestinian arab, hamas is a radical islamist organization made up of mostly males between 20-60 with their leadership effectively 40-60 year old conservative religious males. Now please explain to me as a lesbian female living under a radical islamist government, how are they fighting for my freedom to be a lesbian and secular let alone my rights as a woman?          




 Um how do you stop a bomb that's already in place and a previous attack was actually stopped by the jewish authority. The brits who had a military HQ there refused to evacuate.  




 Falafel, hummus, and shwarma aren't Palestinian culture. 

 *filfal, from Aramaic pilpl, "small round thing, peppercorn," derived from palpl, "to be round, roll". Thus in origin, falafel would be "rollers, little balls." 

Besides it dates to middle-eastern jews and egyptians.  




 This is incorrect. The jewish peple settled in the land in the 1800's under theodr herzl. Groups of arabic nomads and bedouin were the only people left in the region until more arabs showed up with the return of the jews, not being racist but yes the arabs believed that if the jews returned that the land would prosper and they could get paid by working for them. It's culturally ingrained by people to believe jews have money and can turn anything into a paradise. Which they did... 

Anyway these people living in the mandate of palestine eventually by the british came to be known as palestenians, the only people who identified as this however were jews. The arabs got offended and declared themselves southern syrians. In 48 after 2 decades starting in 1921 with the neba musa riots(jerusalem) in which a man by the name of haj amin husseini tried to eradicate the jewish immigrants living in the land. Shit got cray cray, the jews set up defense forces like haganah, the arabs kept trying to exterminate the jews like during the 1929 palestine riots, the jaffa and hebron riots etc till the point where the jews got tired of there shit in started their own paramilitaries since the british(who controlled the mandate) refused to protect the jews. Something about antisemitism being an ingrained right of people. So the jews developed orgs like stern gang,irgun and lehi. Jewish extremist groups. These groups then basically went on an all out back and forth tug of war between the jews,arabs and the british forces. The arabs killed jews, the jews killed arabs in return, the brits stepped in, got both arabs and jews killed or ignored it, in turn the jews/arabs killed the brits. 

The mainstream zionist authority tried to keep the paramilitaries at bay and calm, which never worked out, they cooperated and helped the british authority. Eventually the brits after getting tired and ww2 coming and going. Decided to let the newly formed un handle this "palestine" situation. The un mandated a partition plan where the jews would get 45% of the land, this land would be about 40% percent jewish and 50% arab. This was in the negev mostly and along the coast. Arabs would get 55% along with some 15,000 jews. With jerusalem now officially being a un mandate governed city. The jews agreed thankful to get this and arabs said hell no. They launched a war and lost to the jewish forces holding their ground. For 20 years jordan/egypt occupied the land allocated for the arabs, after israel retook this territory, the plo formed by egyptian born arafat. They took the name the jews discarded when they founded the jewish state of israel and began a war against the jewish statehood. Since that point we have a palestine national caused based on a political ploy nothing more nothing less.


Way back on March 31, 1977, the Dutch newspaper Trouw published an interview with Palestine Liberation Organization executive committee member Zahir Muhsein. Here's what he said:

The Palestinian people does not exist. The creation of a Palestinian state is only a means for continuing our struggle against the state of Israel for our Arab unity. In reality today there is no difference between Jordanians, Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese. Only for political and tactical reasons do we speak today about the existence of a Palestinian people, since Arab national interests demand that we posit the existence of a distinct "Palestinian people" to oppose Zionism. 




 Simply put. Their not claiming your "land" they're claiming the ancestral home of the jewish people. As exemplified by the numerous jewish artifacts,holy sites,cultural sites and historical evidence that points to it being a Jewish state. The country of israel was founded not by religious orthodox jews, ben gurion, theodr herzl and the rest were all atheist/secular jewry. Biblically speaking the most religious jews are anti-israel believing only the messiah can create a jewish statehood, which is why whenever you see an orthodox jew at a pro-palestine rally they're usually the radical guys who don't have a problem chilling next to the former iranian president who host holocaust denial events. They're also the reason why you hear about little girls being spit on and women told to sit on at the back of the bus. They're firmly anti-zionist.
Zionism is exclusively about giving the jewish people a homeland to free them from centuries of antisemitism. 

Hell golda meir the first female pm of israel had this to say in concerns to moses.

"Let me tell you something that we Israelis have against Moses. He took us 40 years through the desert in order to bring us to the one spot in the Middle East that has no oil" 
























 Sir. That's not nice. Your wife is a very nice lady just ask the mailman, pool boy and gardener. 




 Then why are you complaining. Exclusives are a reality, it happens on all platforms. The entire concept of this subreddit is about how your platform is better and more exclusionary compared to console peasants just seems kind of hypocritical to be mad about console segregation when this is what the subreddit stand for and that we're better then the console peasants.  









 You're on PCmasterrace complaining about console segregation. Really? that's the entire purpose of pc masterrace, you're just mad it's on xbox.  




 Regardless of rather or not they were looking for the one shit starter, the men dealt with their issues, unless the women were all chosen because of their personality or lack thereof it could be used as representative. Not to a fault but close enough, i'm pretty sure if the producers chose women who were bitchy they also chose men the same way but still one group overcame this.  




 This was years ago around when i was 10 or 11, it was at this go kart track in Wisconsin dells. Family vacation, me, my sister and her boyfriend were all racing on the track, we were really into it, i love go kart racing and we got extremely competitive between the three of us. I sped ahead, leaning into the curves, began meticulously taking out the kids who all seemed to be Suburban tourist from bumfuck Dakota. I would ram their carts, knock them into walls and do my best to spin them out, i turned a simple go kart race with kids who some were 8 years old or younger into a mix between mario kart racing and death race. At one point i ended up in a fender bender with a kid i purposefully rammed so hard. I was young so i don't remember the extent of the damages but he either suffered a concussion or whiplash. In my defense i was a huge fan of mario, i was go karting and i could not help but get my head into that perspective blame the video games not me!!

Suffice it to say the people who run the track were not please, me and my sis being city kids could care less though. It was the dells, there were a dozen other go kart tracks across the street and within a 2 block walking distance. We cursed them out and walked off, they told us never to come back, we did eventually and they for some reason were still mad,my mom later heard of this in was.... extremely dis-pleasured.

TL:DR Went off into a mario kart trance, gave kid whiplash, cursed out go kart operators and strutted away like a dbag. Mom whooped my butt.  




 Sup fellow 9 goaters, kick out all 6 goaters they can't reddit with us.  









 She's not bi, the imgur did not even explain that fully. She was pretending to be bi, you know like lindsay lohan and miley cyrus. Magic powder is not drugs, jesus it's a trope of fantasy with love potions and magic spells. Read it fully and stop trying to get pissed off over nothing.  














 Isn't it said that we lived in such a self absorbed word where we believe anyone gives a fuck about your MLP fetish or weird porn searches. The list is a lie eat cake and stfu.  




 Good. Fuck your grandfather nazi dog. Sorry for your other grandfather who died who fought on the eastern front.  




 Because one was fighting to stop the imperialistic genocidal racial supremacist expansion of two empires. One being the Hitler Reich and the other being the imperial Japanese army, both who committed massive crimes against humanity. Your comparison is the equivalent to saying why is luke skywalker awesome for blowing up the death star killing thousands of imperial soldiers in the process yet imperials are guilty for blowing up alderaan. Gee idk maybe because the imperials just blew up a civilian planet that's nominally peaceful versus a planet destroying super weapon under the control of a xenophobic genocidal empire. 

Now is that a black and white comparison which is not fair since in war it's a moral gray zone? yes it's unfair but ww2 is probably the closest we can come to a black and white narrative in concerns to historical warfare. While yes the us might have it's own issues, racism, and prejudice at the time, it was not outright directly trying to exterminate entire groups of people, while it might have put Japanese citizens in concentrations camps it did not do horrific human experimentation like the japanese unit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731, it did not force them on death marches and it certainly did not force the women into sex slavery. In this is coming from a guy who actually admired a German general by the name of Rommel, who also knows the common German soldiers were not ideologically the same as the nazi's at the end of the day they were on their side in died defending them.

Also because the Germans were the aggressors, they invaded Poland, started militarization which all led to the eventual crushing of germany. Their crimes and horrors they inflicted on the russians in stalingrad paid back ten fold when the soviets came to take berlin. You want to know why Germans do not celebrate these men? it's simple because they like Hitler were the architect of their misery, if you want to know why a German mother does not celebrate her brave forefather soldiers ask her about the post fall of Berlin soviet rape sprees and killings. 


 









 So originally saw this movie on netflix and fell in love, it my was the first time i had ever seen a asian epic movie without flying people or mystical warriors. So i've been kind of dissapointed that their does not seem to be any info on the other films coming out in english or any information regarding us releases.  




 Indeed. LONG LIVE ZIONISM. 




 So the title for the new total war game  based on warhammer has really been annoying me. I mean come on total war: warhammer it's the most unimaginative and uncreative name for a game, even metal gear revengeance at-least had some type of thought process behind it. I think TOTAL WAAAGH or TOTAL WAAAGHAMMER would be much better, the core fanbase would of course recognize it and newer players would be more interested in this title then something called total war: warhammer the rehammering 




 Nah they have a new algorithm. It automatically has avoid rock slingers and terrorist features built in. It also comes with gps coordinate feature so you can email the idf to send in the airstrike if you take a wrong turn in need a immediate shock in awe on some "peaceful" demonstration by terrorist.  




 "Wow. You literally don't know what you're talking about.
this all falls down to the same claim that to the rate of which college age women will be raped
Are we still talking about how many rapes aren't reported? No we're talking about how you get the estimates you're claiming.  Because this is so far from the truth it's astounding. The FBI/Department of Justice has routinely estimated the number of unreported rapes in the USA every year. Here is a report which estimates that 65% of rapes/sexual assaults went unreported from 2006-2010." where's the report then?"

"This is wholly different from the 1-in-5 figure, which does not come from a 1980s study. Did you actually read a word of what you just linked me? Because in the very opening paragraph it talks about it coming from a 2007 study, and the chief warning from the researchers is that their study was too narrow, only focusing on two schools, and so shouldn't be used as a broad strokes thing." Sorry i was referring to this. http://brown-spectator.com/2013/04/lies-damn-lies-and-rape-statistics/ which cited the original 1 in 5 stat. 

"Because of that, a new study sought to get new data with over 1000 respondents across 500+ schools nationwide, and guess what they found? One in five women and one in twenty men in college said they'd been sexually assaulted or raped." Which study is this? http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail iid=593 the bureau of justice statistics says it's 1 in 40 and has significantly decreased and college men were more likely to be raped then women.
"This almost never happens. Intoxication would be someone who can no longer consent because they're very drunk/high, not just having a beer or two. Deception would be either pretending to be someone else in a dark room, lying about using contraception when you weren't, or the like." Wow a guy lying to a girl to have sex never happens are you this dense.  So if both persons are drunk or the guy is drunk is the female a rapist for having sex with him? lying about contraception? really?

"Anywhere from between 1 in 12 to 1 in 20 of the "average kid" will be a rapist someday, actually. And it's about creating an environment in which people are educated and aware and can help stop it. If you're a frat boy and one of your fraternity brothers says that there's a girl passed out in the other room with a wink-wink-nudge-nudge, you can say "whoa dude leave her alone that shit's not cool." Will it eliminate rape entirely? No, not at all. But it will reduce it - as we have SEEN." Seriously where are you getting these numbers from? i want actual sources.
Then what does that have to do with the rape culture which is usually in reference to america's college campuses.
Rape culture extends beyond the campuses.

It really doesn't it's in reference to the belief that their is a perceived boys will be boys attitude that obstructs rape victims from getting justice and that their is a pervasive system in place that does not support the victims of sexual assault. At-least that's what it was originally in reference to.  




 You're really trying to backtrack, this all falls down to the same claim that to the rate of which college age women will be raped, i believe it was 1 out of 5? i looked up the study and the only source for it went to a study from 1980's yet it's often repeated, even president obama cited it back in 2010. http://time.com/3633903/campus-rape-1-in-5-sexual-assault-setting-record-straight/ 

They based it on the same studies you're citing, honestly i'm not arguing with you i'm just waiting for you to actually stop repeating the same crap i always hear and present factual information. They all use the same anon self report census and the sample sizes if you can call them that are based on individual locales which are not representative of a nation wide epidemic or rape culture. But you can't say that, because it's not helpful when we still have politicians who actually believe a woman can "shut that shit down" so i agree with the scare mongers media campaign for the purpose of awareness but when we use this in a attempt to negatively effect or blame a society at large then it's more then a media buzz word it's an ethical issue. 

Define deception and intoxication? girl gets drunk, her friend says he loves her, next morning they wake up, he says i'm sorry Lindsay i just said i loved you so you would sleep with me. She feeling regret over the situation yells rape. In there you go, you see how that works out? in don't tell me you have never heard a sjw talk about regret being a valid reason to claim rape. 

Sorry let me define it in small words. Telling kids not to rape does not work because the average kid is not a rapist, telling a little girl the average boy will rape her is not factual yet it's being proposed as a viable method.

Then what does that have to do with the rape culture which is usually in reference to america's college campuses.  




 No offense but your post reeks of the same sectarian bullshit, alawites dehumanize sunni's blah blah what you forget is that if the sunni's were in power they would do the same if not worse to the alawites.  




 Better then yours when you claim something and then post a link that contradicts your own statement. Did you not even read that story? there is no other 68, that's the issue. There are not a hundred rapes reported, you just said in your last comment it was all theoretical. No what you're doing is trying to do is redefine rape, educating kids on rape does not correlate to actual rape because it's not in relation to sex or average population figures. Rape is about dominance and control, not sexual violence.

You can't find any numbers yet you just stated around 88 women went to jail for false accusations of rape. Do you just state things out of the blue? 




 Wow good on the uk. Now lets bring this to the rape culture of america. Um it stated clearly in the story if you bothered to read it which i guess you did not, that she was arrested and jailed for falsely reporting a robbery and for the robbery itself which is a huge miscarriage of justice but like i said shoddy police work. Now can you cite this 89 number? i would love to see to it and why america has not done it yet.

Rainn great org, http://time.com/30545/its-time-to-end-rape-culture-hysteria/ nice to see even they are tired of the rape hysteria. Yeah that's what i was waiting for the hyperbole line, you do know what theoretical means right? it has no practical application. In other-words your only 10% line is bullshit, you're claiming a stat which literally has no basis in reality. That's the height of bullshit claims.   

No wonder we can't actually fight rape when the advocates fighting for it are using such fanciful claims and misleading statistics. Rape culture= if you don't want to get raped, do not wear revealing clothing, such stupid logic. If we don't want men to rape, tell your boys not rape women. #facepalm

 




 "But we are allowed to prosecute them. People are prosecuted for false accusations. Not many, because the burden of proof is very, very high to avoid something like the Sara Reedy case."

Alright please link to me a case where someone was falsely accused of rape and the accuser went to jail.

"She was arrested and charged with falsely reporting a crime. This is a fact." I read the story, posted exactly what it actually stated and it said nothing of the sort. You said she was arrested for a false accusation, it clearly stated she was arrested for false reporting not an accusation. Am i insane or something? when did it say she was arrested for false accusation against a rapist??? it says clearly false reporting and robbery.  False reporting is a crime, false accusation which is the entire point i was making is not, are you ignoring this?

"We are basing these numbers on studies of our legal system. The most stringent analyses we have suggest that 2-8% of reports are false. The most recent, Lisak, came in at around 5% - right in the middle of that range. Coincidentally, that's roughly the same rate at which other types of crimes are falsely reported, too.
The 2-8% figure comes up time and again. Study after study.
Of course, even 5% means that with tens of thousands of reports per year, we'll get miscarriages of justice like Brian Banks. But a handful of high profile cases is in no way an epidemic."

So.... explain this to me like i'm 5. Where does the statistic only 10% of rapes are prosecuted? 




 Oh had no idea bruh, thought you were being a right asshole mate, my bad. Did not know i was asking for that, i didn't want people to make a build for me but this is my first time so i made a post over at buildapcforme tho since it seems simpler. Thanks for that, i thought this subreddit would be able to help guide me so i don't just randomly buy parts and other things. But i clicked on the sidebar and i'm going through it, once i have a better view of what i want to build and parts could i post a thread here with that defined build in get some tips to fine tune it? 




 **What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.**

Gaming mainly strategy games like rome total war 2, shogun total war, mount and blade, but also hoping to play fallout 4, witcher 3 and chivalry. 

**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** 

700 dollars is my maximum



**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** 


Around july 14. 

**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc)** 

Tower, i was thinking of buying rebuilt and maybe just replacing parts but depending on the best build i will buy a tower case also. OS matters little unless it effects gaming, won't the best monitor i can find but not going to blow my budget on it, a decent monitor for a decent price even used will do. 
**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** 

Illinois/united states.

**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.** 

Starting from the bottom, no reused parts except if i find a really good cheap monitor on ebay or amazon.

**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** 

* Replace this text with answer.

**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**

Depending on rather or not a game requires a large memory, cpu or w;e then parts relating to that will be paramount to my build. 

**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**

Nope this is a basic pc build, but if it does not mess with my budget having a nice custom full tower would be a good finish for my first pc build. 

**Do you need a copy of Windows 7 or 8.1 included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference for one or the other?**

Windows 8.1

**Extra info or particulars:**

 




 Well like i said i'm new here, thought this would be a good place to get a helpful start and i prefer to actually talk to posters instead of going through sidebars and helpful guides, which is why i came to reddit, if i wanted the 1,2,3 of how to build a pc i would just gone to youtube.  




 Nope consoles also.  




 I am. The game is the only new ip that blew me away. The forums are blowing up.  




 In the case i cited under any definition, it was malicious yet it was still not prosecuted. How do you accidentally accuse the wrong man of rape? most rapes like murder are not due to strangers but close personal acquaintances. You're really reaching, of course, but they cannot be innocent until proven guilty if we are not allowed to even prosecute them.

"Following further inquiries, Reedy was arrested for theft and false reporting and, pregnant with her first child (by her now ex-husband), thrown in jail. She was subsequently released on bail, but lost her job. More than a year after attacking Reedy, the man struck again, but this time he was caught and confessed to the earlier crime." wtf i read the story and that's not how it went down at all. She was jailed by a idiot detective who did not believe her story of being forced to give head at gun point to a guy who robbed her gas station which by all accounts is kind of hard to believe at the outset, i mean what kind of idiot would put their penis in somebodies mouth they're threatening to kill. But yeah crap police work, she was not jailed for falsely accusing any man tho she was jailed because they thought she had stolen the money. 

Either-way your comparison falls flat because that was not a false accusation being prosecuted and then later being proven true. So only a quarter of rape's with actual evidence lead to actual arrest strange. So it takes actual evidence for people to go to jail? that seems like b.s and needs to be stopped right now. 

Tell that to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Banks_(American_football) unless you have facts to back up such statements we're going into hyperbole. How can you state only 10% of rape reports and then say they're not false, how do you know if they're false or not, if only 10% are being brought to court then maybe it's because only 10% are actually valid. What are we even basing these numbers on?
 




 Convicted. Look up the data for minorities convicted of crimes and giving harsher punishment and whites convicted for the same crime while receiving more lenient punishment.  




 Bro whites have a bigger population of course more whites end up getting shot, that's not the point, out of all those cases how many of them were unarmed and were they currently commiting any crime that justified the use of deadly force? did you see the homeless white guy who got shot in california or arizona? he got plenty of attention and the cops were charged with murder. Allot of this has to do with rather or not the shooting gains traction in national news, we can't be pissed if we have not heard about it.

That's not how it goes at all, just because black people are more likely to be involved or commit murder does not relate to instances where they were not committing a crime at all, if anything the fact that black people are being killed in instances where no crimes are committed is much rarer yet it seems to be occurring very frequently which is an alarming trend. 




 Wtf is up with you guys always trying to define everything as non racist. Nobody is claiming white people are hunting down black people but there are cops who happen to be white in the majority of cases shooting unarmed black civilians, pointing towards inner city crime statistics in saying oh look more black people killing black then cops killing black people obviously the problem is not that law enforcement is shooting unarmed civilians it's that black are killing eachother. It has nothing to do with what black people are concerned about or why we're mad, it's the equivalent to citing the rate at which jewish husbands murder their wives and then using it to excuse the holocaust. Just because a crime occurs that involves both groups of people does not mean they're related or have any significance in the other case. 




 In how many guns and drugs do they have exactly? 




 Wow black people being killed in high rates and the first thing i see is racist jumping in awesome. 




 Rachel dolezal for the last 37 years has pretended to be black, artificially darkening her skin, wearing black hairstyles(styles frequently worn or originating from African american communities or popularized by black people) she has also been investigated for false claims of ethnic/racial discrimination, filing police reports stating that her branch of NAACP(which she is the president of) had received hate mail, it was later found out by police investigators only two groups of  people have access to the mail box in question, the postal workers who were ruled out and the box owner who happens to be Rachel dolezal here's a video of a reporter who led the unmasking of miss dolezal, she had also attempted to apply for city jobs and positions citing her ethnic background as "black" and her parents have claimed she is claiming her younger adopted siblings who are African american are her biological children https://twitter.com/deray/status/609179032006041601 
























 Wow this is amazing even better since you're not a gamer. Oh one thing tho, we never say neckbeard, that's a le reddit thing. 




 Toxic masculinity. A harmful effect of the evil patriarchy that denotes men as being violent, sexually aggressive, unemotional and so forth. Once again if you had bothered to read my post where i clearly pointed out this view of men is a concept not deriving from masculinity, the evurrrrrrrl patriarchy or men at all. It is a belief held by those feminist who would seek to eradicate the masculine gender role along with all gender roles in other-words it's from the great tumblrina crowd, or for you to better understand it's a made up stereotype which in reality is not factual or relevant to real life issues in concerns to masculinity. 

So now that i have explained that to you, is their anything else you would like to know since you clearly cannot think outside of the usual rhetoric you have heard. 




 Weird. Whenever someone finds the need to explain their ridicule and derision with more then one post it's usually because they have a hard-on and a need to be right. You seem to misunderstand simple concepts, i did not describe toxic masculinity because their is no such thing. I stated clearly not everyone fits into the masculine role and not every lil boy should or will grow up into such a role. You believe i am contradicting myself, so let me clear this up, the masculine identity is one you're free to choose or not choose.

Your concept of masculinity like your argument is a throwback, you believe that their is a omnipresent cultural pressure to force a boy into a gender identity and this masculine ideal. You believe the only way to stop this "masculinity" is to emasculate all those who choose willingly to embrace masculinity, maybe not you directly but those with similar opinions. In other-words you're doing a scorch earth policy when in reality all you need is a scalpel.

The only way masculinity as you believe can be toxic is if masculinity becomes a set ideal or benchmark, in while in the past in certain societies you would be correct, their was a definite ideal of what well defined masculinity entail but like time itself things change, what you consider toxic someone else considers the norm and what they consider the norm i find weird. This is where our world view departs, instead of seeking to better understand the different meaning of masculinity and what makes a man masculine you're seeking to rid the world all together due to a prejudice view of a stereotyped concept because you believe this will somehow free young boys and give them the ability to have even more choices when in reality you're essentially limiting the choices of all the boys who would prefer to simply grab the action figure or play cowboys in Indians because you're afraid that this will once again become the standard or norm.

But now i'm rambling. To wrap this up. Masculine like feminine is a diverse concept both heavily stigmatized and stereotyped, we're living in a new age where women are able to redefine what feminine means beyond the idea of a gentle sexual being who is emotional. Which is i know what you would classify as a "toxic" femininity because it's the stereotype, but my point of view is that instead of trying to destroy these "toxic" beliefs or ideals in one fell swoop we should learn from, encourage them so we can truly understand what feminine and masculine is, so we can begin to understand the complexities of these concepts. Now i probably did not explain this perfectly in you will probably reply i'm right at the edge but i fail to to see what lies beyond but you're also failing to see my simple point which is that some people are not willing or do not wish to see the complexity in femininity or masculinity they are stuck on the stereotypical view in which to destroy it all together. 
 




 You reply with meme's. Le reddit intelligentsia i see.

Listen:

1. Reread my post
2. Reread my post
4. Reread my post.
5. I did not skip 3
6. I did not add a period to 4, 4 is not real.
7. Then please reread my post again, get a friend to help you and then you might understand remotely what i stated because it's pretty clear. I never said that would be an issue, i was stating the eventual decline of white men like everything else is inevitable, so saying persecution could never occur is hyperbole.  




 Masculinity is toxic. How is that not persecution, not all men are manly men with rippling muscles and gravely voice, i don't think anyone is stating they're or this ideal should be forced on all little boys growing up but the idea that masculinity is toxic is an attack on men and a effort to dis-empower us. I don't call femininity toxic, i believe we should support both of them as a way to progress. Only way to provide equality, trying to stop a boy from being a boy is just as wrong as putting a woman into a predetermined and inferior role. Same concept, why would you want that for anyone. 

Also while i agree this is a mans world, we run this and always will for the foreseeable future. If you look at certain countries in europe who are trying to remove gender specific pronouns like he and she, force little boys to sit down and pee instead of standing are taking things too far. The idea that men will rule indefinately is utter crap, no empire last forever, if 20 years ago you had told me a black man would be leading the worlds only remaining super power i would have laughed for hours. But it occured and he was elected twice thanks in part heavily by white people, in 50 years white men will be a minority, latino's will probably outnumber white non latino's and we're becoming more progressive. 

So what happens to all the conservative christian white males? they die or become marginalized. I'm not saying this justify mens right's but if you don't think it's possible that theirs some element of men out there that are or will be prosecuted you're being willfully blind. I'm not white, christian or conservative but i can see why MRA/MGTOW exist granted i don't really consider them as viable organizations, they're good at pissing off feminist and trolling which is always a nice way to spend your time. 




 Actually dumbass. That's the definition of free speech, what free speech does not protect you from is consequences of your free speech. By that i mean it only relates to the government censorship. But you can say fuck you, you're a piece of shit faggot to the world and besides being ostracized publicly nobody can really do anything to you. 




 True but who hasn't hit it and quit it with keira already? post level 20 glyphs are impossible to find plus she probably sells them at 2,000 like the other skingy bastard merchants.  




 Wait the beached whale? 




 Really? point em out for me. I got my greater red so I could careless but for my second playthrough a good drowner spot would be a lifesaver.  




 Thanks.In i plan on starting a diet with my mom who's around 290 But what about my penis doc? that's the one thing i'm really concerned about. Are my symptoms common of uti after effects or what? 




 You should do a ama. The way you described why you have this side project/hobby was awesome. I kind of thought you were a dbag at first but now i get it.  




 This is for consoles. We struggling out here.  




 Not a spoiler.  









 Oh my bad ha i figured it out after i read it again. 

Also while i don't disagree with you entirely on realistic armor depictions. But this idea of the medieval plate armor being the standard for armored protection is not factual or realistic, armor came in many different forms and styles, the armor ciri is wearing in the first picture is actually viable. While the idea of boob armor is literally retarded because it directs the blade towards your chest center which is a weak point ciri's armor in the first picture with a little adjustment could direct the blade away, just flatten out the main metal chest piece  so a blade hitting it would slide off remember blades are cutting tools, you can't pierce plate i doubt it would even cause any kind of internal bleeding unless he were to use a bludgeon type weapon or a sword hilt http://www.radpour.com/images/stories/sassanian_persian_archer.jpg

 So spent hours trying to find a bloody glyph salesman to sell me some greater glyphs. On my last leg, i decide to say what the hell, fast travel to the alchemist around novigrad, to the north east in the woods, in the graveyard/crematorium the guy who is a wizard in hiding. Turns out the bastard is a magical alchemist ha, in other-words if you back out and go to the "show me what you got screen" or exit from the conversation entirely he switches his inventory from runes to glyphs and vice versa once you get back to his inventory screen. You might have to do it twice or 3 times to get to the greater glyphs but he has them. Best part he sells all the greater runes/glyphs for under 1,000 dollars. In effect making it much cheaper to buy glyphs/runes then crafting them which it already was even if they sold for 2,000 orens. Also fun fact you can dismantle swords/armor and keep the single glyph/rune or if you have witcher gear or swords(your glyph and runes will upgrade with them) 




 Am i the only one who realizes that most of the dlc outfits are post witcher 3 storyline related in concept? 




 So explain to me realistically how chain-mail boob armor protects ciri? 




 No that's chainmail not fishnets.

 The current iranian government only goes back to 79 idiot.  




 It's not a fact at all. Stating israel was the one who included iran into the axis of evil is hyperbole.  




 To all my fellow redditors. Iran=/= government, iran= good people who actually hate government. Only people who support government are former revolutionaries turncoats(those who agree with the theocracy) and islamist who crushed the secular revolution. 




 You do realize that it's not the media forcing the ayatollah to say death to america and israel correct? those are what they state at their rallies. Btw the iranian people are good people but they like israel hate their government. Get it now? see sunni good muslims, but isis bastards? 




 This is actually so true. It's a shame that not many people  know this but Iranians and the Israeli's along with the kurds are the 3 most secular/progressive/humanitarians groups in the region especially compared to the arab regimes. Yes i'm a zionist shill but i also support the iranian people, i looked up their history with israel and the zionist movement and it actually goes back to 1948, the president of iran "mossadegh" actually recognized Israel's existence and was one of the first countries in the world to do so and the first country in the middle-east. 

He was later overthrown due to not nationalizing Iranian oil by the cia, but israel's relationship continued heavily under the shah. Cutting the ayatollah pr campaign crap about how much he loves the Jew's, a uprising amount of ordinary Iranian's actually do care ofr the people of Israel and vice versa. Furthermore it seems this goes back centuries, in the 6th century when the persian sassanid empire was reclaiming territory lost to the eastern roman empire they made confederation with the jews living in israel in exchange for them helping the jews recover their homeland from the byzantines and fight alongside the sassanid empire. 

Theirs a long and common bond between them, the iranian youth is well educated and could care less about religious extremism. The 79 revolution was more socialist/communist/anarchist in origin then anything close to islamic. The islamist however just with the arab spring took over and crushed all secular revolutionary groups. Theirs a great animated film about a young girl and her journey as  woman through post revolution iran, forgot the name but it's a great watch and read. Theirs another story from a jewish womans perspective also if you want to see how jews withered the islamist takeover.

Anyway i support the iranian people, i've always felt if iran were to remove the ayatollah, give up territory to the kurds and make peace with israel they could collectively be a force to reckoned with if they ever allied. 




 A few months back i had a UTI, had a bleeding on the inside(tip of ) my penis when i woke up one morning and pissed, right after pissing i saw blood dripping. Went to the ER, got it cleared up, i later found out i had a UTI, got medicine for that, but my penis still feels... well weird, like it's dry and sticky whenever i attempt to masturbate. I feel pains down there, i have pains on the lower part of my adbomen around my groin, my butt feels tender and in pain also.

 Lmao you have yorick brown, the height of emasculated bitch boy comic book characters.  




 I can see why you chose hawkeye as your flair. When did comic books become the new staging ground for emasculated men to white knight causes on the basis of feminist rhetoric? Jesus being a bitch boy to feminist will never get you laid..... ever... not now, not back in grade school and not in the future. 

OP's post was sensible compared to your diatribe.

 Question why is it whenever it comes to politics southerners immediately spout off how they're the greatest patriots this country has ever seen, how much they love america, how they hate anyone who doesn't love america unconditionally. But then immediately go on about how they have a right to recognize and protect their "heritage" concerning a flag that represented the biggest treachery in us history and a heritage of nothing but traitors. How can you claim to love america but support those who attempted to destroy it by splitting the union? 




 Vietnam was an american war. The only people who would hate that would be Vietnam and even they don't hate our soldiers and there are no hard feelings concerning the war or it's effects. I mean theirs a mcdonalds ho chi minh city now, japan was justified nuclear attack that no one will ever apologize for. Your analogy does not work.  




 True. Live and let live.

He's like 90, he's not saying oh f muslims they will be fine on their own, he's stating he is trying to help those he can with his current abilities.  




 Does anyone have the bank meme showing clearly that of the top 5 banks in the world asians run 3 of them? in not a single jew runs one.  




 Wow the utter level of antisemitism on this thread.   




 MODS REMOVE THIS HEATHEN NOW 




 Anyone who mention's lil Wayne as a a good example of hip hop kill yourself.  









 No............

Yes ok i searched for two minutes and ran to reddit. I'm a fucking addict for this site man, do you not understand this, it's hard so fucking hard. I need to post. Forgive me.  




 No i started researching what they stated. Only found strawman arguments and biased sites then came here.  




 I am lazy and fat. Don't come and trigger me bitchboy. In no i don't think veganism is hard, i do think it's annoying when people use hyperbole to debate subjects.  




 True but it's better to use reddit. Plus much more informative, then a dry read, if i wanted to read a wiki i would of done it myself.  




 If anything i'm trying to enlighten myself. Your answer however is nothing more then outright rudeness. 
 














 "You may have not have had a chance to read my edit on the previous post, but I will mention it again here. If you have the legal right to do something, you don't need to petition a court to carry it out." Once again that's not how it works, seceding is not legal right framed into the constitution, that's why if you reread my post you see my clearly pointing out they would have a very good legal case to argue they can secede from the union. It's not inherent. 

"And, second, if the Court miraculously sided with the South, the North was now in a political pickle that would undermine their ability to deny the South's legitimacy." Now you're getting it. The right of secession being fought in the courts would of been a nightmare scenario for the union, Lincoln was extremely lucky the question was settled on the battlefield instead of court. Which brings me back to how heavily the south fucked up by going the war route instead of holding fire.

Nope midwest. In you would be correct if fort sumter was a hostile entity, look at the placement of the fort, being under threat of cannon's would be a reality if a war had already begun, like you stated previously it did not kick off until 61. If fort sumter was a threat to shipping which they were not i could agree but they were not firing upon any ships. All ships coming into port would be commercial vessels or foreign only confederate naval vessels the few that did exist would possibly be faced with fire in this is only later in the war.

 Yes because ol lincoln is the king of the us and he has the god ordained ability to force the supreme court to keep the union intact. Do southerners not understand the 3 branches or what? regardless of what lincoln believed or not if this went to the supreme court in the south was in the right his protest would be null and void.

The forts were voluntarily surrendered because either they were housed by confederates/southern sympathizers or not given direct orders to hold the fort. Once again just because you declare an intent to secede does not make it so, they did not dissolve the union. The civil war was the deciding factor in rather or not the union would be dissolved, you seem to believe if someone declares something it is automatically law.

Link some info on how it threatened shipping lanes. You mean they were in effect blockading and besieging a federal fort from resupply? how is that peaceful?! he told them they were coming so they would not be stupid and fire upon the ships. That's the exact opposite of invading that shows he clearly did not want them to misconstrue relief as invasion. 


In god i need breakfast lmao that last post ugh wtf anyway um once again the question of rather or not they were sovereign was a constitutional issue not a inherent right. They had the right to take it to the supreme court not secede in begin seizing federal territory.   




 That's cute. Jennifer Lawrence, heroic lead role of one of the biggest franchises in cinema to date. Gets paid more then Chris pratt now explain to me why does this exist? because it's about the box office that's all that matters in Hollywood. Point to a single case where a woman makes less then a man in Hollywood? you don't because salaries are not even published unless they choose to release the info. Being a actor is not a set pay scale, theirs no way to determine or make a report on wage gap since they do not get wages god how can people be this stupid. 

Furthermore we do not know what she got paid for american hustle, you're referring to "point" she got 7 compared to christian bale's, renners and other's 9 points. This is intellectually dishonest to say she got paid less because she has a pussy in they have a penis. First, Lawrence had a minor, supporting role in American Hustle. This is just a fact. Cooper has the Hangover Series, among other hits, which hold the #1 and 2 spot on the highest grossing comedies of all time. Between them, they probably have over $4 billion in box office hits and are big, international draws. The contract for this film was probably made in 2012 or early 2013, which was just after Renner's The Avengers and during which time Lawrence only had the first Hunger Games under her big box office belt. 
A lot of Renner's scenes were cut, including the original final scene.  He was originally a much more central figure, and the only really sympathetic character. His part was as big as Bale's and Cooper's in the shooting script, I believe. None of Lawrence's stuff got cut, I don't think, which is why she feels so big in the movie, but she's definitely more of a supporting roll.  It became clear that the Amy Adams storyline would be the central focus, and that Renner would be more of a supporting role (as he is a real person and a lot of his stuff was expository).  Cooper's role increased as a result of the plot shifting to Adams and Bale more exclusively (he's essential to that part of the story). Then the rest of his scenes with Louis CK had no chance of being cut. I believe most of the original Renner scenes were with Bale (whose part was also slightly smaller than originally intended, though he drives the narrative).  Also, David O. Russell really wants Renner to be seen on the level of Bale and Cooper which is probably why david o russel was pushing to get him a equal 9 points with bale and cooper, and his chops and creds merit that. 

Oh 9 out of ten best actors in the last few years were men? SO????! should we start paying actors and actress the same amount because of their genitals, you sound like the people who complained when selma did not get nominated for the academy. Just because you make oscar bait and did not catch fish does not make the entire academy the equivalent to the kkk, adam sandler made 49 million because his movies are extremely profitable and because he owns the production company.

That's how he gets 49 million, think of it like call of duty. Same game every year but it makes a billion easily, why is this? it's utter repetitive crap, but guess what people buy cod and play the crap out of it. Yes they're infinitely better video game franchises but they don't have as much mainstream appeal. Hollywood is the height of this business model, if actor A brings in 700 million just because his name is in the credits and actor b only brings in 500 million and then actor c has 30 years of work, is an Oscar winner and has been nominated 30 times who do you think i will pay more? the guy who is bringing in 700 million.

Hollywood comes down to knowing what you're worth, a great example of this is charlize theron who was livid when she found out she was not making as much as co-star and told the studio she wanted the same, in guess what? they gave it to her. If you're worth 20 million dollar in 9 bloody points then call your agent up and tell them you're not filming a single scene until you get that.

It's not rocket science... oh wait i forgot according to feminist and pao women are inferior hagglers, due to their "delicate" sensibilities so they cannot properly argue for their worth or value to a prospective employer. Damned patriarchy. It's sad that all these female actresses will never be on equal footing with male costars because theirs no such thing as idk agents who negotiate your contract? 




 No at best it's purposefully being misleading. That's not how it works, seceding from the union would be a constitutional and rather or not it is granted in said constitution. Declaring independence and taking over federal property/territory(remember just because it sat in the midst of south Carolina does not make it their territory) if texas seceded all of those military bases are still us army and the army would have every right to refuse to hand them over. Once again this comes back to south Carolina and the confederacy jumping the gun on a legal dispute. 

Now you're just being nonsensical and ignoring the law of cause and effect. The south declare it's intent to secede, took steps to do this, you already pointed out they had begun taking other federal forts and was going to take this one, that's not preventing or attempting to prevent invasion that's outright seizing territory that does not rightfully belong to you. By firing on this fort you're effectively invading union territory. 

Furthermore the confederates states had no right to order any federal installation to surrender their arms. Unless the fort actively blockaded and obstructed the shipping lanes directly harming the confederacy you're using hyperbole to justify a hostile action. In we're back to speculation once again, this is why you will never win any debate, baseless speculation on what if's is not a valid argument.

In that's not how it works, you fire upon me or my person i have the full and unequivocal right to defend myself to the best of my abilities, the best case of this is with Israel, regardless of rather or not Palestinians fired munitions cause damage or casualties you're still firing upon them. Lincoln was justified in burning the south to the ground and Sherman almost did following the siege of fort Sumter. The south started the war they could of ended with one court battle. 

 




 First that's a lie. If the south had tried to leave in peace they might have actually had a chance, the right to secede goes back to the original 13 states when they ratified the constitution. At the 1787 Constitutional Convention a proposal was made to allow the federal government to suppress a seceding state. James Madison, the acknowledged father of our Constitution, rejected it, saying: A Union of the States containing such an ingredient seemed to provide for its own destruction. The use of force against a State would look more like a declaration of war than an infliction of punishment and would probably be considered by the party attacked as a dissolution of all previous compacts by which it might be bound.


The ratification documents of Virginia, New York and Rhode Island explicitly said that they held the right to resume powers delegated, should the federal government become abusive of those powers. The Constitution would have never been ratified if states thought that they could not maintain their sovereignty.

In other-words had the south not jumped the gun literally and brought the case of secession to the supreme court they would have had a very good legal case based on the constitution itself to secede from the union. Instead they went to war, in the case of the legality of secession was settled when the union won the civil war.

That's not how it works, take the Ukraine situation, while crimea "voted" to join up and become apart of russia all Ukrainian weapons, ships and other state owned properties are still legally the property of ukraine. Had not the war in eastern ukraine broke out and even after it's conclusion russia shall be required to compensate or hand over the Ukrainian naval ships.

In once again this goes back to them choosing to fire on a federal fort, just because south carolina declares itself seceded does not nullify federal governments right any and all property located at said fort. They attempted to take a federal fort which under all laws is illegal and can be whittled down to a basic case of outright theft.

Furthermore you cannot invade your own territory, like i posted above the constitution provides the federal government any and all means to stop hostile elements foreign and domestic in support of the defense of the constitution. Had south Carolina allowed the resupply and went the legal route declaring this a invasion of their now sovereign territory and suing the federal government they would have had a much better chance in the long run.

Now you're going into what if scenario's but even if Lincoln was dead set on invading regardless the south legally would have been on a higher ground and the support for the war would be completely different. What the north and even slave owning states saw was domestic secessionist force hostile to the federal government fire upon federal territory instead of Lincoln being the big bad invader like the southerners like to postulate it showed the supposed defenders of their homes firing the first hostile shot turning a legal dispute into a outright war. Thank you for acknowledging this.

 




 The majority of southern people think the civil war was fought over states right and that this is the actual confederate flag not the battle flag. In otherwords people are stupid, it does not matter how you identify with a flag, the flags popularity and resurgence stems from racism and pro-segregation with a origin in the cause of slavery. I don't care if 40 years from now germans will identify the nazi swastika with pride in being german it is still a racist symbol so get over it.

it's not to extremes it's the most logical comparison if any. OMG this is your problem you have the same level of b.s in your ears, you do not seek independence by firing upon a federal fort and seizing it, which if you succeeded would be another countries property. The civil war was not about independence it was about keeping slavery, stop trying to glaze over this with nice words they wanted to keep slaves, the states that succeeded announced this clearly.

That's why the secessionist movement even exist, that's why the flag exist and that's what it comes down to. Both were immoral movements, the only difference is grant being a drunk allowed the south to get federal troops removed when we should of stayed and made sure the next generation grew up not knowing their fathers and grandfathers were wrong and taught this. Instead it's been over a century in we're still dealing with the same old bull because southerners can't admit their ancestors started the bloodiest war in american history to own black people and then have the audacity to tell black people to let go of the "race card" like seriously how hypocritical and ignorant can you be. This comes down to nothing more then the fact like with japan white washing their atrocities you have a generation who either does not know or outright supports these war criminals, the only difference is southerners call this pride. If only we had not allowed history to be whitewashed. 




 Seriously i don't get where all this hate is coming from. While i think his newer movies are crap, i grew up on water boy and click or trick or w.e that movie with the remote was also very good. Yes some of his films have bombed hard(not financially) but that does not explain where this idea of his career fading or him being hated comes from. Is this about the rose McGowan thing? goddamn matriarchy!!!! 




 AMERICAN HUSTLE WAS CRAP UTTER BORING CRAP.  




 Wow it's almost like you had a point. Oh remind me again about what interesting/complex films chris pratt or channing tatum has done to get better box office draw? it's hollywood. Remake central. if you want more complex films then become a writer, that's not sexism, hollywood is filled to the brim with crap reboots.

Edit: downvoted me all day, my point still stands. Hollywood comes down to whoever is hot or popular, women and men get paid on what they can bring the studios, the idea of a wage gap in hollywood is hilarious, if you want more or equal money to somebody like jennifer lawrence or leo dicaprio then make the studio money otherwise shut up. Women get less lead roles yet sandra bullock made 135 million last year compared to robert downey jr's 75 million 




 Wtf are you talking about. That's exactly how it works RBJ went from like 500,000 thousand in iron man to 20 million in the sequel. It correlates to box office earning, if you bring in people you get paid more. No matter how many box offices you have if you start slumping then you lose that amount.

 Agent orange fucked our soldiers over more then Vietnamese i believe. In the government still refuses to acknowledge this, sorry not stating they did not suffer but i have not heard any complaints about Vietnamese mad about it, can you link information on this?  




 True, trail of tears is the most egregious example of this. But theirs a difference between outright genocide(think of australia with the aborigine's) versus ethnic cleansing. Theirs no doubt the colonials were trying to get rid of indians but outright genocide them is not correct on any level, they broke every treaty they ever made with the native tribes and confederacies but if they wanted to exterminate them outright they would have just kept shooting in damn making a treaty. 

Natives got screwed over long before the colonist arrived, with the germs that traveled up from south america, ever looked up the civilization of north america pre- colonialism? the death from germs was catastrophic and decimated what we now believe to be 90% of the population, had not this occurred the colonialist would of been crushed due to sheer numbers, one of the explorers of early america sailed around the coast of the eastern now what we know as the us and said he saw bonfires across the entire length the eastern coast. The white man did not fight 300 years with the natives because they did not outright want to exterminate them(because they also did not want that) but it took 300 years just to beat them and even then they had to force them unto reservations at the point of artillery guns. 




 Congress apologized and paid restitution in the 1980's. Furthermore japanese americans served in the army during ww2 and one of their units is the most highly decorated unit in american history. While i'm sure theirs people still annoyed by it i thought any of the older generation of japanese americans feel negative towards the us flag.  




 Theirs a mcdonalds in the former capital of south vietnam. Peace has been made on all fronts in vietnam. I've never heard of a pissed off Vietnamese still mad about the war. Never stated we were a glowing beacon of admiration but american culture most definately is, for every terrorist in iraq who says death to america theirs a dozen listening to the newest pop hit from an american artist and visiting nyc. That's something bastions of imperialism in the past failed to due, where we rub people politically the wrong way, culturally we make up for.  




 Honestly do they have memorials to nazi's? lets remove these confederate memorials to.  




 This is semantic bullshit. I can use the same argument, to the jews the nazi swastika is  symbol of genocidal hatred of them and their entire people. To a neo nazi or german "nationalist" it's a symbol of their pride of being german, of their ancestors who fought to for their homeland of the innovations and technological leaps due to germans. You can't just say muh pride is in this flag, it's still a racist symbol despite how you try to argue people see different meaning in symbols. So do nazi's does not mean you will ever fly the nazi flag over germany again. 




 Um did you get this off of russia today? 




 I understand your post but this comes from ignorance. THE FLAG WAS POPULARIZED BY THE KKK, IT WAS A REACTION TO CIVIL RIGHTS lynyrd skynyrd and dukes of hazard came after the fact it had already been in usage for decades to support racism. This is the equivalent if a celeb tried to redeem a swastika because of it's ancient and peaceful heritage, but it just does not work. Southern pride should not be a symbol of segregation, racism or treachery to your country, this only occurred because we allowed the south to continue on their same ignorant path post reconstruction and we continue to fail to educate the younger generations about the history of these symbols. 




 Southern pride is racist if you base it on the concept of pride in the confederacy and your rebellious slave owning ancestors with your symbol being a flag popularized by the kkk. 




 Because idiot. One not the same flag in actuality. We changed it, the us flag is not the same flag that flew while we were expanding into manifest destiny and secondly horrible oppression of native americans has never been a qualification or ideal of being an american.  




 Vietnam has made peace with the us. Japan is an ally and they were in the wrong during ww2, middle-eastern people? like who? only isis and pro isis sunni's got screwed over when saddam fail. 




 Incorrect the near genocide was the result of the germs. We spent 300 years fighting a war against various tribes not outright genocide but plenty of ethnic cleansing and massacres. Sorry had to clarify this and i'm part black foot indian(no not some bullshit 1/38th my great grandfather was black foot chieftain) 
























 Yeah sorry once again that was not clear. The "you" was in reference to Reddit admins and have no morality was in reference  to their policies on censoring in how ironic it was that the ceo of reddit would give coon town a pass because they don't brigade but support the banning of FPH. 

I'm really sorry if you misconstrued my post as an attack on you, i did not remotely mean it to be directed at you, it was horribly worded but if you continue to be a disrespectful individual i will be very clear so you will understand when i am directing vitriol at you. I suggest you calm down before you get more upset in this conversation turns from misunderstanding to a extremely negative exchange. Have a nice day.  




 Sorry i was being rhetorical in reference to Reddit and it's moderators/admins being idiots. In the pedophile reference was to a front page post about Germany providing therapy to pedophiles in how the entire comment section was a bunch of pity post saying how pedo's were not bad people and got a bad rep in some other crap, basically a circle jerk of pedo supporters. In no i was not referring to you personally stating this, i was referring to how the new ceo of reddit officially gave them a pass.

  




 Alright can you point me to some of these NGO's?

Well Kurdistan is not in existence yet, we're effectively referring to Iraqi Kurdistan and only Iraqi Kurdistan. You can't declare them as the only representatives of the Kurdish people, theirs PKK,PDKI,PUK,Gorran Movement,Yekiti,azadi,pyd etc all of which have their own various ideals.

Even bloody KIU is pretty moderate in their views to an Islamic kurdistan. True but theirs a much better chance of him getting released then in say Iran, Gaza or the gulf. Listen i understand the Kurd's are not perfect, neither is america but they're open to dialogue and change. There are progressive elements that can bring about this change.  




 Ha i think it balances it out. Besides if we're going into all the f'ed up crap Christians did to jews throughout the centuries their would not be enough payback in the world. Lets just keep it simple and forgive.  




 Starwars republic commando, say what you will about consoles but that was one of the most graphically beautiful games i have ever played. One of the best looking in that generation and funnest game play experience i ever had. Nothing beat taking over a confederate ship and firing upon another with the hacked cannons while fighting off super battle-droids. PLUS I MUST FIND SEV!!! 




 Welp  either people are blind or the comments maybe collapse after being deleted? hold on let me try in screenshot something for you.  




 Not just sample bias i'm aware theirs even a sizable number of kurds fighting for isis. I believe the commander who laid siege to kobani was a kurd, but i'm an american my view is effeminately colored by my own personal experiences and a generally held view by most Zionist and supporters of Israel along with the news stories and other tidbits i hear coming from kurds. 

But i'm more then willing to hear more information concerning them. Not going to lie i have a romanticized opinion of the kurds, it's hard not to like the underdog perspective. I read the yousef post, you have allot of links i will try to read more of them later(also no offense but i'm not exactly a fan of al jazeera, while some of their articles are pretty informative the bias kills, granted all media is bias so better to read between the lines other people might reject them just for being al jazeera )

While i disagree with them for arresting the guy heavily he is not being executed. In honestly that's my criteria when it comes to rather or not a country is really embracing of democratic ideals. I know that it's horrid to arrest someone for their religious beliefs or not holding anyway but compared to other examples of those who blasphemy islam i think this is a pretty moderate approach that hopefully will be utterly reverse with more people writing in. 

Also to be clear i mean't the kurdish people, not the government or the political parties, the kurds are in a transition phase so their government may not be the best or even ok i believe in the people theirs a higher chance at secularism then other parts of the region. 
 




 Aww they screwed up then. Allot of east Jerusalem Arabs did the same hoping that when Palestine came into being they would just be able take up that citizenship. I read a story as the peace process has stalled a number of east Jerusalemites have begun taking up a offer by israel to become citizens, in part to make sure if they leave Jerusalem they won't lose residency. 

If abbas and netanyahu can ever get their heads out of their collective ass and get some kind of plan to restart talks, it would be hilarious if abbass seeds israel full ownership of jerusalem. It would be like the people waiting for dukenukem for all those years just to be dissapointed but hopefully it works out. Splitting a city between 2 countries is a recipe for war.  




 Nah i get you. I'm a fan of rommel, but too many people confuse nazi with regular while trying to dispel the myth that every German was a nazi. It's always funny when someone tries to post a thoughtful comment about how not all nazi's hated jews or tried to exterminate them when that was their sole purpose, but yeah i'm in the same boat.

It's hard because either you come off sounding like you're excusing the nazi party or trying to justify it.  




 Indeed that's why he is paying it forward to other Christians.  




 20% of israel is actually arab and all have citizenship. Not sure about the Armenians though, but i believe so i'm just taking this off the top of my head but i remember kanye west and kim kardashian baptizing their daughter in a Armenian church so their population must be sizable. If so they probably have citizenship but i will look into it, ask some of my Jewish friends.

Edit: syriac's interesting... god there was something i read awhile back about Christians in Israel moving away from the Arab identity to become something else but i can't remember the name they decided on but the orthodox church in Israel made it official. Is their like something negative associated with being Assyrian like their is with arab in israel? the Assyrians i've met are pretty prideful.  




 I know the Kurd's are religious, yes it's a generalized statement but from the kurds i have talked to and met, many of them hold progressive views. While they of course have their own issues and stigma's compared to other parts of the region they're very secular. Another group of note would of course be turks but they're too nationalistic even in the face of bad leadership. 

 




 interesting factoid, in yeah i've heard of the Assyrian quarter before. Always amazed where people end up, like the circassians being in israel. Have you got any numbers on how many Assyrians are left?  




 Nazi refers almost exclusively to those being card holding members of the nazi political party and held ideological views similar to that of hitler. regular germans were not nazi's, while i'm sure like with mussolini their were/are a few germans who probably remiss fondly about how Hitler made the trains run on time they would still not be considered apart  of the nazi party or a Nazi, you should differentiate. Many Germans would take this extremely offensive.  




  I cant save the world, but there is a very specific possibility on the Christian side. Let others do what they like for the Muslims.
 He's referring to the fact that there are millions of Muslims and not that many Christians. There are millions of people who are more then able who can help the Muslims including you know 1.2 billion Muslims, along with 22 arab states in the immediate vicinity, but it's out of his capability to help them also, the Christians do not have any allies, the western world is not coming to save them. It's like during the holocaust, millions died, are you going to go grab a gun and try to liberate a death camp or help the lil Jewish girl you found wandering in the street. It's called recognizing your limits and focusing them where they will be of the most help.
 Also he is repaying a debt to those Christians who saved his life when he was a child. He's paying it forward

 This is uplifting not /r/worldnews

If you want to go on rants go to /r/rants have fun. This has nothing to do with your hatred of Israel.  




 Thanks for the clarifications. I always assumed due to the ruins and the simple fact that most assyrians still lived in syria that it was just the remnant of their former empire in their heartland much like turkey would be the remnant of the ottoman empire. 

Edit: was not blaming this on arabs, i assumed that arabs who are the majority, since most islamized people in the middle-east are arab or self identify as arab even if they're actually berber like libyans still consider themselves arab. Also are we referring to just homeland? because i referring to all their territory historically.  




 I cant save the world, but there is a very specific possibility on the Christian side. Let others do what they like for the Muslims.

He is not a super hero, he's not saying he does not give a fuck but he just can't help them all and stretching himself out would only negatively effect those he can actually help. Alawites have syria protecting them, assad is an alawite and shia have southern iraq. Christians have no allies and no friends coming to help them, no rescue.  




 It did actually. The prophet (PBUH) was actually married to a christian woman and that was his first wife.  




 Indeed. Good news though they have a assyrian channel on public broadcasting in chicago, i watch it sometimes.  




 No such thing as brave and rebellious nazi's you're referring to either the Wehrmacht(regular army of germany) or regular germans who were not members of the nazi party.   




 Not exactly. Assyrians are an ethnic group deriving from the ancient assyrian empire which controlled all of iraq, syria,lebanon and other parts of the region. Syria is basically the homeland of assyrians, i believe syria derives from Assyrian. Most syrians are muslim arabs who arrived during the islamic crusades. Assyrians have been there since the beginning but they're now a minority.  




 Bethel thank you, i really don't think people understand this, he's helping those being most persecuted right now. He has to keep them limited and focused.  




 Yeah i avoid them. Their like SRS mixed with circle jerk. But they stick to their own caves and i stick to the front page so never  the two shall meet. 




 Yeah the mods are doing good. Just scroll down, click on hidden comments and you will see plenty of deleted ones.  




 Unfortunately we have children on the thread and that's why we cannot have nice things yousef.  




 Once again this man is focusing on helping christians who personally helped him. I'm sure on the ground he does not have people sorting christians and non christians into seperate lines in then leaving them behind, he's simply focused on providing the most help he can while at the same time repaying those who saved his life, christians in the region are a minority much like jews were in europe, he cannot save all the muslims, trying to would be beyond his means.

It's like this, if you were living in ww2 in you knew where a death camp was, would you grab a gun and try to liberate it or help the little jewish girl you saw wandering the streets. He has recognized his limits and is focusing on doing as much good as he can with the resources he has, this is the same reason why i don't jump on the us when people say they could of bombed German rail lines to stop the trains delivering jews. I'm not in this mans shoes, we do not know what issues he's facing so we should withhold judgement.  




 Indeed. Maybe we should plug up that /r/gameofthrones leak? 




 So off topic anybody seen the movie pay it forward?  




 Israel secular democratic statehood which provides  humanitarian relief to even their enemies, admits the family of terrorist organizations like hamas and fatah into their territory for treatment as recently as last year. Has caused less casualties in 40 years of war with a entire region then the us and most western powers in one decade of a invasion with a third world country, saved beta israelites(ethiopian jews) throughout the 80's and 90's. Provides humanitarian relief to the world being the first in Haiti after the earth quake, helps African governments suffering from Islamic guerrilla's.

Is the only country where Arab citizens can and do vote frequently, has a supreme court, has a arab supreme court justice, Israeli Arab parties make up a third of their government. Their free speech laws are so supportive that press like haaretz that criticizes the Israeli government and organizations like btselem are frequently cited by Israeli detractors. Israel is the leading country in tech,medical and social media innovations frequently dubbed the silicon valley of the middle-east. 

In i believe was one of the first countries to apply practical military technologies to defensive purposes such as with the iron dome missile defense shield But besides that i guess you can state it as a negative, all those poor children that have been killed, the genocide, apartheid and horrid starvation that cause those obesity rates which put gazans/west banks in the top ten of most obese people in the world. But eh i'm just a Zionist shill....  




 He's actually a german. Who has lived in england i'm assuming his whole life since that's where the kinder-transports ended up. 




 Replace the word debt with duty or obligation. Or just recognize debt unlike how we view something as a mandatory thing that we must pay back regardless of how we feel, the way it is stated in the article is more of a personal choice or moral code. I don't want to whittle this down to religion but theirs a tenet in the Jewish faith that states:

"Whoever destroys a soul, it is considered as if he destroyed an entire world. And whoever saves a life, it is considered as if he saved an entire world.  Mishnah Sanhedrin 4:9; Yerushalmi Talmud, Tractate Sanhedrin 37a."

had to google this. Despite my name religion is not my strong-suit ha but i have always found this very uplifting. I believe the Koran also has a similar passage. 
 




 Yeah the mods are here now. Scroll down to all the deleted comments. Their were a atleast a dozen or more mentioning Jewish stereotypes like all of them being bankers, making jokes about how jews never pay back debts because the're cheap or greedy etc or just one off random attacks on the man saying he is anti-muslim because he is focused on helping Christians first in some really transparent attempts to justify writing negative statements. Normally i'm all for Reddit being critical of people but i read the article a few times in jesus outside of the guy being Jewish theirs nothing to criticize the man for.

If you really feel so strongly that he(a man who is actually doing something for the people) is not doing enough they could easily find a few charities who donate and help with the refugee situation.  




 lolz sorry was trying to be a little humorous failed. Let me delete tha.t  




 Alright to all the people who are hating on this man or believing he is an islamophobe for not helping Christians either you're not reading the article or clearly taking his words out of context to purposefully attack this man. He is helping christians because it was Quakers and other christian denominations like them who funded the kinder-transports( imagine underground railroad for jews that helped thousands of Jewish children escape Nazi Germany and who later adopted the children helping raise many of them who were to become orphans as hitler's final solution became implemented) which he was extremely fortunate to have been on.

I cant save the world, but there is a very specific possibility on the Christian side. Let others do what they like for the Muslims.

He's referring to the fact that there are millions of Muslims and not that many Christians. There are millions of people who are more then able who can help the Muslims including you know 1.2 billion Muslims, along with 22 arab states in the immediate vicinity, but it's out of his capability to help them along with christian's. the Christians do not have any allies, the western world is not coming to save them. It's like during the holocaust, millions died, are you going to go grab a gun and try to liberate a death camp or help the lil Jewish girl you found wandering in the street. It's called recognizing your limits and focusing them where they will be of the most help.

 Two of the victims who are still being forced to live around the predator and the predators supporters it's the same as trying to talk to a abused child while the abuser stands over his shoulder giving the kid death stares. Theirs no way you can get an actual idea of what is going on in that environment.  




 Are their any studies on this? showing trans suicide rates in more progressive regions versus more hostile? that would be a good study.   




 Been agreeing with your post in glad to see their are advocates like you for transpeople. But i was reading through one of your links about trans people throughout history, i'm a history major myself http://www.bilerico.com/2008/02/transgender_history_trans_expression_in.php and allot of this seems to be speculation heavily based on the instances of crossdressing or genderless deities.

Much like how some people use the presence of societies worshiping female warrior deities as an example that their have been female warriors when deities themselves are more of a ideal in not actually a factual basis, other examples like in south america of women dressing as men also does not reinforce this idea. In albania it's common for women to dress up as men if they're no men remaining in order to lead or protect their families, while i'm not outright disagreeing but allot of the cited cases don't to be transgender but more akin to a mulan if you will. Not people who actually identify as the other gender.  




 Very informative thank you.  




 Not a hater of trans people please don't dm me. But question is it true john hopkins officially stopped performing reassignment surgery and declared this a mental illness? 









 Not disagreeing but you'r comfortable others may not be. I think this really will always come down to how people feel on a case by case basis.  




 I don't get this, one minute we're supposed to get over human body issues and next we should all have non gendered separate stalls for privacy? are we becoming more progressive or conservative? 




 Their perspective if heavily influenced by their family is not theirs but a orchestrated ploy by the family for pure PR. 




 Bitchball more like. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07mBfR8erMY 




 You're the people who are shitting on america just for being america. That's the definition of nationalism, you think your country is better then america, you're better then us because you consider us ignorant. That's the height of bullshit nationalism, i could easily go off on the shithole you more then likely live in but i don't, that's why i like my country, call us conceited but we could careless about 99% of other countries. We do not spend half of our free time bitching about some country we have never been to, will probably never visit and does not effect us in any way. Only you come on reddit, american site, using google a american search engine, with a fucking laptop, cellphone or computer probably from america to bitch and moan about the very country providing you with the tool's to call them ignorant. Do you see the level of irony in that?

All of the comments i have seen have been nothing more then a circle jerk of f america because that's popular. Jesus get over yourselves, if we compete then we compete. Have fun flopping on your grass, i did not say we could be the best i said we could compete. Only thing worse then a boastful fool is a dismissive fool like yourself.

Your issue is you think you're the end all of soccer, where you from? i bet your country is not even that great, but you condescendingly act like your the master of it, do you even play? jesus i can admit i'm inexperienced but at-least i state this, you act like your opinion is any more factual then mine, jesus it's like that movie on the Jamaican bob sled team, you know little about how our country develops our athlete so stop talking like you do. We don't know what would occur until it bloody happens, all i know is that in general we dominate the world Olympics in various competitions. Our population is the WORLD! we have immigrants from Ecuador, Brazil,Spain England etc, you really think we could not be a competitive soccer team? you act like your clubs don't recruit internationally  and are made up of players from across the globe. You act like a us team could not do the same just shut it. 

If you think that theirs some magical knowledge that is ingrained into your blood stream at having a good soccer team or you need some great culture to kick a ball around then just stop it. Your the same as the idiots who say we would be the best at soccer from the get go.  




 Pretty fly for a white guy.  




 Tell that to the sikhs.  




 True but it goes into the american thing. Americans are not white, we're americans. Majority does does not wipe out the fact they're Tuareg and other darker skinned algerians.   




 http://www.thelovelyplanet.net/algerian-traditional-dress/ It's alright while most algerians are pretty light Tuareg also come from algeria. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuareg_people
Just call me him a Tuareg 




 You mean cricket? is that the thing with the bat or is... oh wait you mean the biggest sport where it's not really sport but where you pretend to be injured for 10 minutes. I think that's called acting where we come from, one opponent that happened to at one point or another controlled or influenced one third of the world.  




 No were not claiming anything. We simply stated we could compete if soccer was more popular in america, just like we could compete if cricket became more popular in america. This is not a claim but a well established facts, america does amazing in the Olympics. On a international scale we repeatedly shown we're definitely top ten in most sports.

I could give a fuck all about your football, but stop acting like you idiots have a set recipe for making great football players. England invented the sport in they suck at it, yet i here people making the same bullshit excuses about how america is only good at sports we invent. I have no idea who does guys are, so i have nothing to compare them too. It's not about having 6ft tall beast though, you are stereotyping because you have a onesided view of american athleticism, we have 300+ people we're not all Michael jordans, have you seen american quarter backs? look at brett favre? you call him a example of athleticism, a QB does not have to be a adonis of athleticism to be good or even great at the game some of the best one's were couch potato's. we can find 5ft7 guys just like we found the women for soccer.

But to do that we need coaching staff, we need people to actually care about the sport. Jesus this is why america does not care about world opinion, you assume we're ignorant and not conscientious then are shocked when you're proven wrong. You guys are the most elitist jackasses i have ever seen, all we're stating is that we could compete, just like we always do and we could be good. Because guess what, that's what being an american is, even if we suck we don't give in, we keep practicing and trying harder. We don't believe in defeatism or relegating ourselves to being underdogs. Maybe you guys should stop being assholes in maybe try learning this thing called sportsmanship? oh wait no you guys are just a bunch of ultra nationalist who use football to talk shit about other countries while decrying america as a hive of uberpatriots fuck off.  




 "And the reason it never became popular is because you kind of suck at football. It's really a catch-22 moment for you guys.
You're not good at football because it's not popular, and it's not popular because you're not good at it."


You contradict yourself saying Americans don't suck at football because we don't care but because we just suck in general. Then use this to say you don't care about women soccer that's why the us won. It's contradictory bullshit. Your an idiot. We could give a shit about soccer, we care even less for women soccer yet we still won it. Nobody cares about half the sports america competes in during the Olympics yet we still get gold, get over yourself. Sucking at a sport does not mean you don't care about it, plus we don't suck at soccer our men team is actually pretty decent from what i hear.
 

The american's who went to the moon, winning the space race, developed most of the technology you're using right now to say we're shit at most things and the people who dominate the epitome of athleticism every 4 years when the world collectively comes together to get stomped by the us Olympic team. Yeah buddy keep on, you're just a delusional hater. God i really do hope soccer becomes more popular in america just so we can stomp you idiots in it. 

 




 In how well do they do in the Olympics? at the end of the day we have a set record for performing good in international event. Jesus we just won the female world cup, obviously Americans can compete on any level.  




 TIL to be good at soccer you must be born in Uruguay, have soccer in your blood, you must be born from your mother being impregnated by a soccer coach and you must eat a thousand blades of grass from the purest soccer turf. Only then my apprentice shall you master the ability of flopping. 




 In my experience their seems to be a bunch of people made about the women world cup still hating on americans for saying we might actually be able to compete if we cared to play.  




 Unique skill set, i'm pretty sure we can flop with the best of them.  320 million people who do not even know soccer is actually called football versus 3.5 million who's only chance of ever having a better life is through football..... yeah makes sense.  




 God this is why we don't like you soccer nations. Ingrained into your culture? jesus stop being full of yourselves. The fact England sucks shows how bullshit this argument about culture is.  




 Hakkzpets um we just won the women's world cup. Are you guys retarded or what. It's not popular because we don't care about soccer, we named it soccer for a reason. Now stfu in wait for the next olympics so we can dominate you little third world nations again.  




 How is it asinine, people are posting we only do good in sports that are popular here but no shit, that's how it works. Would spain,brazil or any of those countries be good in soccer if they were not extremely focused on them and very popular. America dominates in the Olympics, if we focused on soccer we would more then likely at-least be competitive to a certain extent. You in user https://www.reddit.com/user/CptMurphy think we're talking about oh we throw in a few running backs on the field and some point guards in bam we can win the world cup, no we're saying that if we focused our athletic resources and got kids into soccer at a early age like the rest of the world does, we could be on the same level as the rest of the world.

Remember america is a sleeping giant, don't wake us up.  




 Tell that to japan about baseball or china about soccer.  




 China loves basketball, japan loves baseball along with most Caribbean countries.  




 True. But we also dominate the olympics. Oh in we just won world cup thingy or w.e the world calls not football.  




 Bro i'm a zionist shill not. I don't use alternate accounts. If i did i might have more karma lolz. What am i praising kurds for? you're assyrian i'm guessing? i'm sorry if you feel like the kurds are pressing for control of territory your people want but i still support them. Compared to other parts of the region they're the best chance for stability. 

If basra was safe then why did they change the gulf cup because of security concerns? listen i'm not against you i just support kurds. I don't dislike assyrians and i support all secular people, i dislike the iranian government yet i like their people because i know they're moderates. I've talked to a number of southern iraqi's on fb in i understand that they're atleast moderate enough to talk openly with jews/pro israeli's in even support israel, so that has drastically changed my view on shia. I don't particularly care for sunni's but the kurds are sunni in i respect them.

In yes i know about the embassy bombing, i know the kurds history, there are various groups who even kidnapped some foreign nationals back in the 90's but what's your point. I'm not stating that the kurds are perfect, israel has done questionable military strikes in the past but i still support them. The kurds are atleast in 5 different conflicts right now from isis, to syria, to the FSA/various rebel groups, turkey possibly and next it may be iran for all i know.  




 /r/shitredditsays basically they link reddit comments and have a circle jerk talking crap or making witty statements about the user in his comments or his "complex" or compensating or w.e basically like brigading without actually brigading. But who knows they probably pm the user too. I don't know how they do not get banned. 




 Aww now i see. You're mad because the kurds are building a state on your territory.  




 Indeed. Did not know this?

It has been said that the history of almost all of the Jewish holidays can be summed up succinctly: "They wanted to kill us; we won. Let's eat." Why has anti-Semitism been so pervasive in so many countries, in so many time periods and for so many reasons? (One begins to wonder. Perhaps there is something wrong with the Jews and Judaism? After all, there is an old Yiddish saying -- "If one person calls you a donkey, ignore him; if two people call you a donkey, buy a saddle.")

Between the years 250 CE and 1948 CE - a period of 1,700 years - Jews have experienced more than eighty expulsions from various countries in Europe - an average of nearly one expulsion every twenty-one years. Jews were expelled from England, France, Austria, Germany, Lithuania, Spain, Portugal, Bohemia, Moravia and seventy-one other countries.

Historians have classified six explanations as to why people hate the Jews:

Economic -- "We hate Jews because they possess too much wealth and power."
Chosen People -- "We hate Jews because they arrogantly claim that they are the chosen people."
Scapegoat -- "Jews are a convenient group to single out and blame for our troubles."
Deicide -- "We hate Jews because they killed Jesus."
Outsiders, -- "We hate Jews because they are different than us." (The dislike of the unlike.)
Racial Theory -- "We hate Jews because they are an inferior race."

As we examine the explanations, we must ask -- Are they the causes for anti-Semitism or excuses for Anti-Semitism? The difference? If one takes away the cause, then anti-Semitism should no longer exist. If one can show a contradiction to the explanation, it demonstrates that the "cause" is not a reason, it is just an excuse. Let's look at some contradictions:

Economic -- The Jews of 17th- 20th century Poland and Russia were dirt poor, had no influence and yet they were hated.
 
Chosen People -- a) In the late 19th century, the Jews of Germany denied "Choseness." And then they worked on assimilation. Yet, the holocaust started there. b) Christians and Moslems profess to being the "Chosen people," yet, the world and the anti-Semites tolerate them. 
 
Scapegoat -- Any group must already be hated to be an effective scapegoat. The Scapegoat Theory does not then cause anti-Semitism. Rather, anti-Semitism is what makes the Jews a convenient scapegoat target. Hitler's ranting and ravings would not be taken seriously if he said, "It's the bicycle riders and the midgets who are destroying our society." 
 
Deicide -- a) the Christian Bible says the Romans killed Jesus, though Jews are mentioned as accomplices (claims that Jews killed Jesus came several hundred years later). How come the accomplices are persecuted and there isn't an anti-Roman movement through history? b) Jesus himself said, "Forgive them [i.e., the Jews], for they know not what they do." The Second Vatican Council in 1963 officially exonerated the Jews as the killers of Jesus. Neither statement of Christian belief lessened anti-Semitism.
 
Outsiders -- With the Enlightenment in the late 18th century, many Jews rushed to assimilate. Anti-Semitism should have stopped. Instead, for example, with the Nazis came the cry, in essence: "We hate you, not because you're different, but because you're trying to become like us! We cannot allow you to infect the Aryan race with your inferior genes."
 
Racial Theory -- The overriding problem with this theory is that it is self-contradictory: Jews are not a race. Anyone can become a Jew - and members of every race, creed and color in the world have done so at one time or another.(correction jews are a ethno-religious group)

Every other hated group is hated for a relatively defined reason. We Jews, however, are hated in paradoxes: Jews are hated for being a lazy and inferior race - but also for dominating the economy and taking over the world. We are hated for stubbornly maintaining our separateness - and, when we do assimilate - for posing a threat to racial purity through intermarriages. We are seen as pacifists and as warmongers; as capitalist exploiters and as revolutionary communists; possessed of a Chosen-People mentality, as well as of an inferiority complex. It seems that we just can't win. 


 Of all the extreme fanaticism which plays havoc in mans nature, there is not one as irrational as anti-Semitism.  If the Jews are rich [these fanatics] are victims of theft. If they are poor, they are victims of ridicule. If they take sides in a war, it is because they wish to take advantage from the spilling of non-Jewish blood. If they espouse peace, it is because they are scared by their natures or traitors. If the Jew dwells in a foreign land he is persecuted and expelled. If he wishes to return to his own land, he is prevented from doing so.

- Lloyd George stated in 1923

   "The uniqueness of anti-Semitism lies in the fact that no other people in the world have ever been charged simultaneously with alienation from society and with cosmopolitanism, with being capitalistic exploiters and also revolutionary communist advocators. The Jews were accused of having an imperious mentality, at the same time they're a people of the book. They're accused of being militant aggressors, at the same time as being cowardly pacifists. With being a Chosen people, and also having an inferior human nature. With both arrogance and timidity. With both extreme individualism and community adherence. With being guilty of the crucifixion of Jesus and at the same time held to account for the invention of christianity."

- A speech about the irrationality of anti-Semitism 
by professor Michael Curtis, of Rutgers University, 1987
 




 Oh look neo-nazi's complaining about a positive story on jews. LOL 




 I already explained this. Muslims did not save him in ww2, it was Christians, now he feels a personal obligation to help those who helped him. Christians are a extreme minority in the region directly being persecuted, they're in the same position he was in back in the 1940's.

While i'm sure if he see's a fleeing muslim family he would not be like, you guys are not christians get out, he is focusing his efforts on christians because that's where he can do the most good and save the most people while also satisfying the debt he feels to those Christians who saved his life. But once again, people like you are not doing shit, just complaining, unless you want to fight isis be quiet.  




 I'm pretty sure the kindertransports had allot to do with their religious values not in spite of them. Christians are odd like that, one minute they're doing pogroms the next they're supporting jewish statehoods. You do realize Christianity is a offshoot of Judaism correct? once again millions of muslims, only thousands of christians. He's trying to help the most persecuted people who's very life is in danger. 




 Yes i'm well aware, it was also non existent until very recently for their to be any kind of terrorist attack in Iraqi Kurdistan and it's extremely peaceful compared to well any other part of iraq. In yeah but i agree, their maybe some islamist factions but of course there are, kurds are in the middle-east, it would be surprising if this was not the case  but atleast the kurds stick up to their radicals and implement moderation and secularism which is more then then allot of other countries do.  




 Pm me. How did it ruin the message of the film? 
























 Lmao. Are you positive about that? look up Catherine the great.   




 Not a girl but the biggest instance of me missing a signal from a girl was back in high-school. My little brothers sister(different dads, different moms) no relation outside of my little bro, anyway she randomly started hanging around me whenever she would come over to visit my lil bro, one day while she was spending the night over our house(this was long after my mom and her dad had ended but she was still close to our family) she came to my room, asked me to come into our living-room, i sat next to her, one thing led to another and i lost my virginity that night. 

Anyway a few weeks later, she calls my house, i pick up in she starts talking about how she wants to come over and hangout again and asked could she speak to my mom, my mom and her are on the phone, she ask my mom, mom looks over at me wondering if i want to be bothered i blurt out mom no! because despite the fact we had sex i really could not stand her or her sister, my mom also did not want to be bothered so she made up an excuse in said maybe next time. I later realized what she was hinting at when she said hang out again about 3 months later. F%#$

 




 I don't get it? 




 What's the difference? you act like men give a damn about a woman being a slut. We look for the slutty chicks, that's why we head to the clubs, that's why we dream of nympho's and that's why we like to get chicks wasted. News flash the guy is not interested in your personality, he's interested in those personalitits. 

You think a guy will stay around for the illusion of a blowjob? some might but the probability of an entire town doing so not likely. Calling b.s, op your mom is the town bicycle.  




 Academic*  




 So how long did it take you to realize you were married? 




 lolz facts. 




 Brazil for one. 




 In once again this is why spain,england, france and the rest of these countries with generations of knowledge continuously under-perform compared to countries which came later. Scroll up they did state that. 




 or did you? but yeah interesting.  




 America has 5x the amount of the us? so we're outclassing ourselves goddamn it.   




 Aww he is adorable. https://boxerworld.com/forums/threads/long-hair-boxer.19839/page-2 googled this, one of the comments mention this is traceable back to some uk breeds.  




 Can confirm this guy punches.  




 Then. I looked it up-_- it refers to time. 

Back then is correct back than would be incorrect when we're referring to time. Nope fuck  you're correct, than is used in conjunction with more.  




 Yeah but i'm talking pre-79 




 Ha funnily enough this is my account. In no i'm not using subterfuge, now death to israel!!!! joking i'm a pro-zionist shill:) but i do support the Iranian people, in no i did not leave out the ayatollahs. I thought this was common knowledge they ruined the relationship. 




 Right. Like they did for josh by sending him to a former cop who turned out to be a child molester? lmao these are the side hug people. More then likely they have made them feel like it's their fault.  




 2 of 30..... right. Anyway i'm just saying you should give a better source next time, mainly because i think allot of people would be interested. Start with india and south east asia, they probably have clear cut cases.  




 Not what i feel. What we clearly saw in the interviews, like what you're doing by stating oh it "happened" a long time ago and "why is this even being brought up" etc 




 I don't watch 19 kids and counting yet it still exist until very recently-_- 




 No saying america could not compete because we do not have a century of heritage with kicking a ball with our feet is shitting on America.  




 Um professionally? or are we talking about public popularity? can you link some info. 




 The article clearly referenced male to female and vice versa instances where actors did it in china, also i never said they only did it for entertainment purposes i clearly pointed out various social political purposes and even modern purposes by citing Albanian women in concerns to why people cross-dress but like you stated before crossdressing is not indicative of transgender identity lets leave it at that and not contradict ourselves because i'm not arguing against your points i'm really not.   




 I can go scroll up in point out where you stated this and passed it off as fact."http://www.bilerico.com/2008/02/transgender_history_trans_expression_in.php If you think being trans is some new fad, please realize trans people have always been a part of humanity and they always will be. History is full of examples of trans people attempting to transition with what society has at hand at the moment. From the Gallai of ancient Rome, to the two spirited people of the America's there is not one culture or time in all of recorded and unrecorded human existence in which trans people did not make up some percentage of the population. The only difference is that now, as is the case with many other medical issues, we have developed appropriate treatments.
When people say "trans isn't real because chromosomes"-

In once again those same feelings and causes that are indicative of transgender identity is can not be discerned from historical figures. Like you pointed out crossdressing is not endemic of being trans-gendered if so jamie fox, martin Lawrence and jim carrey would all be transitioning as we speak. They're many reasons for cross-dressing using examples of this as indicative of a historical presence for trans-gendered is not factual and should not be passed off as such. But like i said i understand where you're coming from, it's how i feel when someone tries to disprove me in concerns to african history. I know my people, i know where we come from and i know that we did not just pop up in chains so sorry once again if this looks like i'm attacking you.  

 




 No one said feel awful but i have a problem with someone downplaying child sexual abuse, especially if they're being what's the legal term in court? led? led to this conclusion and outlook. Most people do or are you a duggar? 




 Damn it i knew you would see the line and misconstrue that, let me reiterate a line can be curved. I am not line biased. No but in all seriousness it's not speculation that is bad or dangerous, it's not even gender or sexuality speculation unless you're catholic in then that may be a problem. Rather or not Lawrence of Arabia was gay,straight,bi or even asexual is a very fond subject of historical biographers, speculation is a big part actually when it comes to biographical portraits of historical figures, the main issue however is when this speculation is passed off as fact.

The thing about biographers is allot of what they write on a person, specifically personality traits and other characteristic's that are not backed by specific writings or other things are all really just speculation when it comes down to it this is the norm. But theirs a difference between presenting something as speculation and presenting something as fact, earlier a poster referenced suicide rates on post op trans and you had at him because obviously this is not factual. The same can be applied to you, i have no problems with speculation but you should clearly label this as speculation of the gender identities in historical figures/people's when citing it for the basis of your statements instead of passing it off as fact. I know this was probably because you're tiredd of transphobes and want to present a strong argument to shut them down but in the long run it might be better so you won't have to deal with anyone attempting to discredit you on the basis of this alone.

 




 Got me there. Because my family cares about my views on those who have suffered from child sexual abuse and have influenced me to this opinion. Thank you jester.  




 I believe to forgive first you must face what occurred, I've never heard of someone being told to forgive a situation when it is still being downplayed and from the interviews the duggar family is really downplaying this or diverting the issue to non relevant topics.  




 Thank you for sharing this. In i understand not from the perspective of an abuse victim but having a number of ex partners who suffered the same abuse, unfortunately even from close family members. Your perspective is not uncommon, my ex felt the same way, she was actually still suffering from the abuse nightly, i did not find this out till later, it took months for me to finally convince she should seek help but she always refused on the basis of "not making a fuss"   she was a very inwardly cold person, extremely guarded when it came to her own personal feelings so i can understand where you're coming from.

She did not want to take any action because she had in her own word built up a wall in concerns to her emotions. I hear this often repeated by those who are victims of rape since it usually is done by someone close to them, how they say they still love the person but at the same time hate them. It's a very confusing place, which is why i have the view that the same viewpoint would be the ones the duggar sisters are having, on the one hand you know what your brother did, but he is still your family. Theirs a documentary i had to watch for a pysch class concerning pedophiles and the children they abused, in one woman said how she still had the urge and inherent need to have her father around who abused her, saying how she felt on certain days after she got a good grade or accomplished something she wished she could call him up in be like dad i got an A.

In you're perfectly fine and from my personal experience your outlook more common then uncommon at-least going by my ex's, allot of times people assume rape victims should be crying, tearful or feeling disgusted in some ways but whenever one of my ex's disclosed this information to me it was either delivered in a matter of fact way or nonchalantly or sometimes just a random w.e to start a conversation. 

I think the only time it was really emotional was when one admitted to herself and me she was being abused, but once again that was when it was still occurring so it can really depend on time and, when the abuse began and stopped, 




 Not you granny. But i have heard from others calling it fluid. In sorry for that then, but you can't decide rather or not my opinion is being nitpicky because sources you're using to validate your statements are not holding up. The point of any source is to be critiqued because this is what you're basing it entirely on. That's very true, in if the concept of gender has progressed and greatly change isn't it wrong to assume our current understanding and view of it is completely null in concerns to historical gender identity?

That's why i referenced the elven crossdresser, what we see as signs of transgenderism, how we view it in that historical and cultural context it can be completely unrelated. The link you posted even states the same at the very bottom. Monks and philosophers actually would not be included but alchemist most definitely, interesting read on the subject of how it was coined  http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=127037417

Imagine if they had chosen atheist, god the 1950's would of been hell on earth for the scientific community. You are popularizing futuristic concepts, just dropped the atomic bomb and split the atom a few years before, the world is hypothesizing new concepts while at the same time people scared of commies are forcing god into everything and here you're, the atheist. 

Sorry once again history major here, that's not factual, much like theories in science we can study events, source historical accounts, if need be excavate and then of course compare in theorize based on the available evidence what occurred. History is literally reading between the lines, which is one of the reasons why it's fascinating. The one thing we cannot do to a fault is really the mindset of historical individuals we can surmise their personalities, traits, and how they might of been but this is all really a opinionated guess which is one of the reasons why i dislike when people try in post their mindsets on historical figures and events. Those who do this usually have a political objective, which honestly i do not mind, but be honest about, if you want to lay claim to Alexander the great being homosexual for the purpose of giving a historical figure that gay young adults can look up to fine but their is a a point we should respect.  




 TLC actually used to be extremely educational but like history channel it sold out.  




 Thank you. Lets not ignore this simple fact, their family is extremely on the cult esque spectrum as you can get without expanding into a compound in adding more families.  




 Yes exactly. The same way abuse victims who are still in abusive relationships or environments or people who have been kidnapped in have Stockholm syndrome cannot have mature outlooks on a situation.  




 Now this is confusing. One minute it is fluid and the next it's not, OK so can i call bullshit on people trying to raise their children gender neutral? because this is becoming contradictory. Not using a stand in it was a personal reference to how complex gender and gender is if anything? 

But all the people referenced, like 9 out of ten were cross-dressers your link implied were transgender. Which is why i pointed it out. OK agreed that's usually how history works, my question to you is how can we then state they're categorically transgender, because then you're putting your own cultural bias on it just like how gay people are now putting their bias on historical figures who may or may not be gay.

But the rest of your post was very informative, sorry if this is nitpicky.  




 Duggar is that you? you cannot wish the pedo away like the gay, it does not work like that, it's not 2 for 1 my friend. Normal families would not protect and allow their son to molest his younger sisters or send him to counseling with a a man later convicted of having kiddie porn. They have proven repeatedly that their method was ineffedctive.  




 Duggar? is that? jesus you cannot wish the pedo away like the gays, won't happen.  




 Going to go a little progressive here but. Gender identity is pretty fluid correct? who says it would be that difficult? we know the concept of tomboy exist, it does not mean a woman who is a tomboy or shows characteristics of a man is trans-gendered or wishes to be a man. Caitlin Jenner lived for decades as a man, he was and is sorry she is a Olympian who was considered a perfect specimen of masculinity and athleticism back in his day yet he is transgender. 

I'm going to use a personal reference here, but i was recently playing this game called witcher 3, theirs a quest, involving this elven clothes designer who likes to cross-dress, he is not into men, does not see himself as a woman but explains he likes to dress up, likes to see himself as other roles, other professions of higher or lower social status. Not saying this covers them but it did kind of give me an idea of how fluid it really is and the concepts of self identity, like you stated we really cannot know absolutely in i think that goes both ways.

"In seventh Century BC, King Ashurbanipal (Sardanapalus) of Assyria spent a great deal of time in womens' clothing, something that was later used to justify overthrowing him. In Egypt, 1503 BC, Egyptian Queen Hatshepsut ascended to the throne, the second Egyptian queen to rule (the first was Queen Sobekneferu of the 12th Dynasty). Possibly learning from the disfavor shown to her predecessor, she donned male clothing and a false beard signifying kingship, and reigned until 1482 B.C. She had one daughter, Neferure, who she groomed as successor (male clothing, false beard and all), but Neferure did not live into adulthood. After her death, her second husband attempted to erase all record of her. And Nzinga ruled as King of Angola from 1624 - 1653, cross-dressed and led several successful military battles against the Portuguese.
Read more at" this for instance seems to showcase that this case of cross-dressing was more due to societal norms in which a man was seen as possessing more power then a woman so she chose to use take up dressing as a man to strengthen her authority not as a pure  belief of seeing herself as a man but it was expedient to use the physical attributes. 

Sorry was kind of hoping it would have more depth instead of being moves in response to cultural stigma of being a woman.  
























 That makes her a boer more then likely not african. 




 Seriously? 




 I see 3 different ethnic groups in this competition alone.  




 Yes idiot. That's the general consensus of how land claims are established, in part it's longevity and simply living there that enshrines this. The natives also settled the majority of america, look up their early civilization before small pox and other diseases arrived with the new world, the native's we know are the result of what a Apocalypse would look like after 90% of their population died off. It's said all the trees and forest that sprouted up due to the loss off life created created a mini ice age in north america. 




 I was expecting more asians. 




 You would be forced to do the same with your kids. 




 Were sorry we got one group of racist mistaken for another group of nazi racist our bad le redditors.  




 r conspiracy theories fuck off. 




 That actually sounds like a pretty fun time for a kid in the 80's without access to cocaine. What was your reaction when the public became aware of hackers/phreakers in the authorities started to crack down on your activities and you started to enter the pop culture lexicon?

 Too old. 









 Funner fact. Heels were specifically invented for mounted warriors, such as mongols, Scythian's,huns hard to imagine but Genghis khan in stiletto's would of been killing it..... literally.  




 also what ever happened to prince stennis if we spared his miserable life? 




 Molly? yeah she was a cutie. I also would not mind taking foltest sloppy seconds,  Mary Louisa La Valette she owes me for not killing her pretentious son and you know saving her kids, oh in freeing her from the dungeon.

 Prometheus gave us fire not charon.  




 Yeah my first comment on here i pointed it out on the exact name you guys went by, BTW when were you a phreaker? during the 70's or 90's? 




 Do people get off on correcting grammatical errors? i know.  




 Hack reddit in change it for me could ya? 




 Aww my one true love, fuck yen and triss it's about that trolggish ruggish love. 




 This^ god it was so out of character to turn her down. That twin threesome would of happened in the first ten seconds of our encounter in witcher one with those practice swords being used for another kind of sword play. 




 No Mr woody Allen, after all it's not like she's your actual daughter or anything. BTW i love all your films playing the proverbial pathetic older Jewish stereotype. 

Ha but nah wincest on a technicality.  




 I'm disturbed on so many levels but also intrigued.... 




 For me it's the master-craftsman nord yoana followed by a close second being the herbalist we met in white run with the tight pants oomph.  




 The kids in question bypassed pre-installed software to stop them from changing their desktop, somebody on here stated that's not hacking when that's the basis of hacking really. Getting around and accessing something you were never intended to is most definitely hacking, allot of people have a preconceived notion of what hacking is, that's why i posted the link to show people the various forms of hacking that have existed for decades originally starting with telecommunications in continuing into the data age with computers. Oh in steve wozniak was a phreaker.  




 Exactly, i used to date a british chick, when she moved back to London we tried to keep it going. Even today international long distance calls are a bitch when it comes to the rates, i don't know if they changed it but if you did not have a plan that included it they would charge a dollar per minute in we would spend hours on the phone.  




 Using nothing more then sound these guys could hack long distance calls, which in the 70's/80's was a huge thing, it would be the equivalent of unlimited minutes/texting back in the early 2,000's without paying a goddamn cent. 


The most well known hackers include Steve Wozniak, co-founder of apple, john draper or better known as captain crunch the man who inspired Wozniak and Steve jobs to start up a black market business. here's an article on some of the greatest early hackers including a blind guy with perfect note recognition, might as well consider him the daredevil of phreaking.

http://motherboard.vice.com/read/twilight-of-the-phreaks-the-fates-of-the-10-best-early-hackers 









 It's kind of funny that some people don't consider this hacking, you should look up the early day's of hacking going back to the 70's when people would use stuff like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phreaking

using nothing more then sound these guys could hack long distance calls, which in the 70's/80's was a huge thing, it would be the equivalent of unlimited minutes/texting back in the early 2,000's without paying a goddamn cent. Man hacking goes way back, we think of it as computers and crazy tech geeks deciphering some computer code in then using it to rob people's data from a bogus ip address listed in the Caribbean but it is so much more. 




 Isn't that the definition of hacking? bypassing preinstalled software,programs and other security measures to do something that the developers had never intended? 




 Iranian. Let me become a mod on that subreddit puleasse:) 









 Number one, i'm a Zionist and we're not oppressing anybody. How do i know this? because i actually do research. My information is not based on fb post and twitter messages with a picture of a kid blown in two that is later discovered to actually be a syrian. I can go into the fact that 20% of israel is arab, a third of the israeli government is made up of arab israeli political parties, a supreme court justice is arab and the various things that israel does for Palestinian arabs like you know make sure they don't starve to death by providing truck load of food to Gaza, allowing the wife of abbas in for medical treatment or the granddaughter of the pm of hamas but i'm not because you would not even listen.

You don't know any facts about the situation, if i told you west bank and gazan's were obese fat assholes who place in the top ten most obese people in the world you would not believe me, if i told you president abbas of the pa authority has a hundred million net-worth and the leader of hamas is a billionaire who lives in opulence in qatar now turkey you would never believe me. Because you don't think you don't research. I do. I had a Palestinian teacher in highschool who gave me the same crap about oppression and planes versus rocks then guess what? i read a book. I read a book about american history in i learned history is not one sided, i learned about the messed and utter bullshit we did that our history book's omit in i learned to read between the lines in do my own research.

That's how i learned that the palestenians aka arabs suffer because of their own stupidity, that's how i learned why israel is blockading gaza and why the world seems so content to allow the new "nazi's" aka israel do this in guess what it's not because the jews control congress (but it's cute that the entire pal narrative relies on blood libel to convince the always anti-semitic euro's to hate the jews even more) it's because israel is a secular democracy, it's because israel is the only country in a region full of arab nation's that provides more rights to Arabs then even arab countries provide to their own citizens in sometimes this is to the detriment of the jewish israeli's especially when one pal arab who got a free college degree while in prison for stabbing a jewish kid gets out in becomes a bomb maker for hamas or coordinates more "resistance" attacks by targeting kindergartens. 

Fun fact look up how many Palestinian leaders (like those who founded bds) studied free of charge in israeli universities, how many got degrees even after being convicted of terror charges and look what they did with it. They immediately go in yell death to israel, when you say palestine what you're referring to is the british mandate that ended in 47-48 with the full recognition by the un of israeli independence and the creation of jordan/israel the results of the former mandate, the arab state of palestine never came to be because the arabs refused.

But you won't read this because you think that a made for tv media propaganda campaign devised by the arab world to help affiliate the destruction of the jewish statehood(theirs a reason why they wave flags declaring all of "palestine" over israel) you're the sap. Btw you're correct isis exist because we invaded, kicked out saddam and disbanded the majority sunni iraqi army, our bad, were sorry next time we should leave a brutal dictatorship in place, that's the messed up part about the region, their so f-ed up their only reasonable leadership is theocracy,dictatorship or terrorist groups. 




 Yeah this is bullshit. 




 Read bro, just read. Look up some of catherine the greats exploits, she was a classic hoe who use it to her advantage to court favor repeatedly. Or go to /r/history in ask about it. Kim kardashian became famous for a sextape actually, Marilyn monroe was a notorious hoe and she was still famous, you objectively stated sluts would not be put on a pedestal yet they were. This woman also had repeated affairs(op states this check his comment history) you really that naive to believe she is not sucking a dick here and there, bro we all see beautiful women, but here's the reality, what is your type may not be my type, i can believe a celeb getting preferential treatment, but if we're basing this off looks only that's bullshit. Yes pretty women, pretty people in general are treated differently, that's just life, but you really believe in most instances theirs a woman beautiful enough that she can away with half the shit op states?

I believe op but only if she is charismatic, beautiful and a local celeb that make's sense but if you're arguing from oh she's pretty she can get anything is bull because not all men have the same outlook on beauty, i have seen women that i have found stunning get looks by 90% of men but theirs always one guy who is oblivious that's just factual otherwise porn would not be so varied, different taste for different people. Also men we're bloody dense son's of bitches, not every guy would even get the hint of flirting in actuality.

Btw if op's mom is a blond i would kick her out of bed because i don't like blonds see how that works. In also that's a club/restaurant all guys are trying to get pussy in that instance, you think all dudes 24/7 are even noticing her? that's just ignorance. Yeah a guy will blow a couple of bills in a club to get a number or 3 well hopefully, but you really think he's going to do it constantly for the same chick when he knows he is not getting anything? puhlease. 




 Same concept applies. People put sluts on pedestals all the time, just look at kim kardashian,Marilyn monroe, they're plenty of recent and historical sluts we have turned into american icons.  
























 I'm confused when did she build up his career and wealth? this is the problem with self entitled people, if i'm a billionaire and you're some pop star just be quiet. He made his own path, she just married into it, they need to end alimony, it's a stupid concept, only alimony should exist if she helped directly contribute to his well being either in a wife role with actual duties or in a professional role that helped said person accumulate his wealth. Same goes for a man in the stay at home role. 




 Yeah thank you. I'm thinking of just buying a iPhone 6 brand new in choosing a carrier.  




 henry ford was a anti-Semitic piece of crap but I don't idolize him. 




 also if I jail break does that mean I can't get a plan? i'm trying to avoid a contract in get a unlimited plan with another company 




 Yeah i saw that too, wasn't planning on taking him out on the field or anything. 




 I've played paintball before but recently decided to get back into it, my lil bro is 6 turning 7 soon in i saw this thing called splatmaster, designed to introduce the young ones into paintball i was wondering if he is old enough to play, i was going to buy 2 of them in take him out. 




 This you op?http://i.imgur.com/mz4H2ie.jpg look much better then the model.

 No ties sex, they're cheating, they think you're cheating, any kids or relationship is out of the question. It's like a continuous one night stand with no drama plus the added thrill of you know not wanting to get caught. 




 I'm sorry is this your showerthought? hop the fuck out of my shower. In i do when my laptop is dead. 




 Super slim probably. In i think i might replace the HDD does not look hard, kind of like the old 360 replacement of hard-drive.  




 You're incorrect. Number one Germany was never an ethnic designation for a group of people because the concept of a united germany is relatively new, in if you ask germans what is germany they will have a hard time describing it to you because unlike america germans don't have a sense of nationalist or patriotic pride in the sense of a united country outside of who they pay their taxes too. Germany was made up of a whole host of minor principalities from Bavarian to Prussians only recently coalescing into the modern german national identity which went horrible for them so now when it comes to national identities Germans are a paranoid about comparisons to Nazi's nationalism. 

Ditto for italy which was made up of a myriad of smaller city states like florence and regions like Tuscany. Their's not a nation called native america but theirs still a united identity among the various tribal groups no matter how recent, in you're referring to south africa as the country, of course they will say afrcan but i'm looking at the ethnic denotation and cultural not nationality. 

No columbus actually ws not super lost when he decided to name them as such, he did it purposefully to insult the natives, he knew he was not in india, allot of people like to believe in misconceptions and this is one of them. Europe had a general view of what other nations outside of their realm looked like in random tribals on a island was not one of them plus he would of known going the way he went he would of ran into china or another eastern asian country before india. 




 Sorry i should of explained further. When i stated niche market i was referring to the fact hellboy is a lesser known comic even by comic book readers, my first knowledge of hell boy came from the movie even though i am a gamer outside of random merch for hellboy or a comic ad in other comics i never read or had much interest in it. He's in the cult comic book niche market which unlike superman,batman, spiderman and iron or even guardians of the galaxy which relied on the brand name of marvel to get people in the door hell boy unless bought by marvel has no mainstream appeal to sell the movie franchise to moviegoers. 

People will chance right now on any comic book movie made by marvel because they know they loved iron man, they liked avengers and its' a fun time for the family not so much for hell boy, unknown rough around the edges super hero who does not even want to be the hero of mankind. 


Of course not, if i torrent something it's because it's either not available or easy to acquire because trust me torrents are a bitch to download if you have no clue what you're doing, you need like 3 different programs(i won't ay them because of this subreddit probably has some random no torrent list rule) and at-least some basic common sense to figure out non malware torrents which cuts out  a large group of casual consumers who do not even know how to properly upload pics to things outside of fb. The people who torrent are the ones who would never of bought your product anyway, movie and record companies realize this in while it might have effected music industry at one point, it has never effected tv/movies in a really negative way, hbo is a subscription based network with a the most torrented tv show in history and the ceo of the company was like that's dope right? we the shit. 




 So i just woke up in this is the first thing i see in all i'm thinking is no no no.......... while i'm not familiar with George Coe's other work which i'm sure is exceptional by his woodhouse performance, this is a shocking loss. After the end of futurama, other shows like family guy and south park became unfunny in american dad losing it's edge, archer is my last hope and a part of that had to due with woodhouse, nothing was better then his often forgotten mistreated heroin addicted butler. I'm at a lost for words right now, you will be remembered for the unending laughter you brought into my and every other fan of archer lives.  




 Thanks for the info. Did you buy a newer ps3 though? sorry my original post was unclear i'm mainly trying to decide on a old grill ps3 or the newer ps3 updated models 




 Oh stfu. The reality is the movie industry is the worse it's been in 50 years, movie theaters don't even make money off of tickets because the studio's sell the film at such a high price. They make money off of concession stands, the films Hollywood makes are unoriginal cash cows with horrible premises. Add that into the fact streaming is much better then spending nearly 50 or a hundred dollars on a family outing for a crap film in you see while studious lose so much money, that in the fact their advertising is abysmal, they spend millions yet when the movie releases know one has heard of it. Even when the movie makes a profit studios due to some creative accounting do not admit this. 

Movie's like hell boy fell because they're a niche market in a even more niche market(comic book/cult comic book smaller fanbase) which cuts off at-least 60% of your revenue stream. Plus when the sequel is just not that great it's not worth it.

 About tree fiddy  




 Tell that to europeans concerning non white people born there. She is a dutch descended whore.  




 So should i go an buy a original ps3 or a newer one with more GB? like my old one you know the grill? i still have my original but my mom is using it to watch movies, plus it's kind of banged up in well old, but i hear it has some features newer ps3's lost, which mine still has. I'm really just interested in experiencing ps3, i never had a chance to really get into it due to being a Xbox player, plus my controller broke in i kept buying cheap ps3 knockoffs which were crap in broke within a weeks time.  




 True but the stockmarket is bullshit made up by idiots who base our economic model off of rather or not something goes up or down in stock price. Which we have no control or prediction over. 




 It's the one poll with those multiple choice answers and it shows you how many people chose what answer, is it dlc related? 




 Read the bible then lmao 




 In i said i'm perfectly fine with the fact we conquered this nation of ours on the blood of others. I'm not an idiot. I also realize we took it from another. 




 I never said it was not? 




 Best skyrim reference was a skellige i got wounded in the knee inheritance quest one, best game of thrones one was tyrion lannister in his sky cell on a pirate fortress 




 The united states is a country built up on the conquered land of native americans. In we are those who continue to support, love and admire the country that did this, are you not a proud american? traitor! 




 No Africa is a geographic term, like europe, European denotes people from europe like african denotes people from Africa. You do not call a arab guy from sweden a European, same goes for africans and asians.  My prejudiced definition? when did i say Berbers are not african? of course they're African and they're indigenous but some white skinned blond chick is not an african, granted we do come in a myriad of skin tones and physical characteristics but nordic is not one of them. Get over your oversimplified concepts of what an African is.  




 German citizenship is not passed down to people born into germany just for being born there, unlike the us where you can be a foreigner and your kid is naturalized due to the 14th amendment which states all children born on american soil are Americans, in this goes even further where nationality/ethnic background are intertwined, i can't be a german just by being born in germany, just like she is not african just because she was born in a african country, african if you believe in racial classifications is a race, she's caucasian, if you believe in ethnic identity she's a dutch descended boer, only under nationality is she considered not an african but a south african in reference to the name of her country , much like how theirs a country called macedonia but they're not descended from the ancient macedonians.  




 Sovereignty only establishes land ownership by force, the native americans also had sovereignty they just lost due to our willingness to kill them more then they were willing or able to kill us. In of course they have no more claim to a land, if a native american came up to me in said this is my land i would tell him to get stuffed, but the fact remains 300 years ago this was their land, we took it, i have no problem with that. I'm a zionist for god sakes, granted the jews are the native americans in this situation but even if you saw the arabs are the rightful owners of the land when they declared a war and lost, all land ownership claims became null.

In actuality their were a myriad of confederations and tribes that inhabited the entirety of the united states at one point or another, why do you think we fought wars with them? the idea of native americans not laying claim to land is b.s, some tribes were more open to outsiders sure but in general their view was not that the land could not be owned but their belief that certain things like access to wildlife, water, in land to grow food was open to others of course native tribes differed on this, in many went to war when their territory was encroached upon, native americans were not hippies and many tribes would sooner be singing a patriotic this is the motherland song then this land is my land this land is your land b.s 




 Being born and raised in a african country does not make you african. Like me being born in germany does not make me german. Does not matter she's still a boer, just because the country is called south africa does not make her an african. I'm a american due to my country name, but i'm not a native american even though due to my great grandfather being blackfoot i can legally claim as such. Damn white people always trying to steal our culture, history and ethnic classifications.  




 Check comment history, i got a juicier argument brewing on another comment, want to come over in join me while i go on a rant about white people stealing shit once again? 




 Does not make her african. She's a boer or south african. I was born in  hong kong does not make me chinese or surprisingly british. 




 Despite the fact that this sounds awesome in theory, i mean 5.4 trillion dollar asteroid?!!!!! but in reality much like diamond planets or planets that rain gold, if we ever found one and were able to access the resources it would literally tank the economic value of such resources. This is why diamonds are kept artificially high, in reality diamonds are the least valuable rare gem on our planet, it's theorized we have enough for a bucket full of them to be given to every single individual on this planet with enough left over for the new born to get 30 carat diamond ear rings, so to stop this debeers and other diamond corporations routinely destroy, or stock up on diamonds in refuse to allow them into the market. That along with the marketing campaign has led diamonds to become one of the most valuable commodities on our planet.

If we intercepted this platinum, we could make cars out of the stuff it would be so cheap, much like the inca's and mayans who saw no value in their gold outside of ornament since it was so abundant. However rare earth metals stuff like zinc and others that i believe china has the market cornered on would be a huge relief even if they tanked it's economic value, they would be hugely useful since we need for our modern electronics, if the us acquired an asteroid like that would be much more valuable then a platinum or ruby encrusted asteroid. Also those helium deposit's on the moon are more valuable.  




 yeah i know but wanted to start an argument, 




 Um look at our expansion westward, who ever gets to the land first is the rightful owner. There's two established ways to get land rights throughout history, be there first or have a bigger weapon to kill those who were there first.

Wtf are you on about , look up the mayan,aztec, Inca civilizations across not, south and central america, then look up the first nations before their Armageddon occurred they had earth mounts made up of dirt from across the united states, interconnected trade routes, theirs a township around Georgia or north Carolina i believe with a population at it's height which outnumbered medieval London. 





























 Of course it affected the local peasant, your crops were gone, your village sacked and your wife possibly raped if you were found outside of the walls. But it was not a outright death sentence like a longstanding war. If your village was close to the local castle you were screwed for a time, but the peasants still managed to live own, i'm not saying they did not suffer any adverse affects but the total destruction of a person's lifestyle was not so complete they could not recover plus peasants were frequently "conscripted" which also if they won the battle was a good way to acquire some nice arms and armor to sell if need be to rebuild.  









 Mercs in actuality. Most medieval armies especially during the 16th century onward or any century past the crusades of the 12th century were mostly made up of foreign mercs  




 True. local pillaging of villages and stealing of crops or torching them was also a huge issue, but you're forgetting one thing, that's only local which would be the villages in a radius at best of maybe 20 or so miles, the besieging army would of course send out foraging parties but only effected the local area. While some sieges could take months or even years, most did not last that long, a besieging army has one major issue, it cannot decamp, it cannot move and it is stuck until the castle is taken and  the countryside for the most part was left intact. You're overestimating the damage of a besieging army on the local landscape, the worst part of any war is not the battles, sieges or skirmishes across the country side, the worse part of any invasion or long standing war is the presence of marching armies. Now a marching army might not sound so destructive but consider this, you have lets say 7,000 men, hungry, some drunk, some pissed off others missing their families and home, the food is crap in you're constantly on the move. What are idle soldiers want to do? busy themselves with pillaging, that's why the hundred years war was so destructive, not because of the constant warfare but because it created lawlessness, chaos and their was always the old score to be settled, without oversight you had lords sacking their own kingdoms towns with no recourse from proper authorities. 

very few armies had the advantage of the enemy kingdom/nation not having a army that could launch a offensive, most were under a set time span to take the castle, leave a garrison to hold the castle and fall back to their own lands. Winter sieges would be horrid for any army, there are plenty of famous instances of armies mutinying after extremely horrid sieges especially if they were not being paid due to lack of logistics with a strong supply line. 

If a siege took longer then a few months, by that point yes your life as a farmer was screwed, because the war would continue for years onward but most sieges did not last longer then a winter campaign.  




 Those are wars not sackings or long campaigns, a sacking in this sense would be the equivalent to a king taking a castle but not marching further for an outright conquest, most medieval wars were sieges not open field battles which would cause more damage to the country side. 

Either-way it all comes down to how long the war was.  









 This needs to be in not the onion.  









 Stalin purged the Bolsheviks(including his right hand man who was a jew) the majority of whom were jewish, yes stalin was a paranoid idiot who was always fearful of allowing others to gain power but he also had a deep seated hatred of the jewish people, most Russians did and do, they have always been scapegoats, just look up the pogroms the soviets conducted against regular non Bolshevik Jewish communities. Sorry i'm trying to finish a paper but I will source the link where it is mentioned this stopped his forward mobility in the party rank's, btw the quote in question was pre-Stalin era, this is in reference during Lenin's rule.  




 Yeah after the golden age during the civil rights movement with the continued economic and political upward mobility of American Jews we kind of had a bad break up. It's bullshit though, of all the minorities in this country blacks should be the least anti-Semitic jews went through a lot of the same crap we went through from discrimination(the only difference is Jews took it as an opportunity, when they were denied jobs and entire professions they headed west in helped found Hollywood) racism/ethnic discrimination and slavery(regardless of how you feel about biblical claims their have been 2 well known verifiable instances of Jewry being enslaved once with the Assyrians and the romans) yet we allow stupid conspiracy theorist, in idiots who claim to be afrocentrist yet when you ask them about the kingdoms in western Africa our direct ancestral homeland they pop a "what's that" fuck those guys in the idiot protesters who have Ferguson/Palestine bullshit comparisons.  









 Obviously you have never been Ridiculously wealthy, upper middle working class are poor compared to ludicrously  wealthy rich people like george lucas in the kind of people who get pissed off at george lucas. 




 Source? damn it i'm a propagandist not a historian jim!

Oh wait actually i'm both. 

More about the largely vacant desolate land of Israel "Palestine" in the 1800s - massive Arab immigration following Jews' return = the true origin of the (today's) so called "Palestinians"

How odd that such last names as al-Masri (the Egyptian,), al-Djazair (the Algerian), el-Mughrabi (the Moroccan), al-Yamani (the Yemenite) and even al-Afghani are so common among those claiming to be "Palestinians."

Today's Palestinians are immigrants from many nations: "Balkans, Greeks, Syrians, Latins, Egyptians, Turks, Armenians, Italians, Persians, Kurds, Germans, Afghans, Circassians, Bosnians, Sudaneese, Samaritans, Algerians, Motawila, Tartars, Hungarians, Scots, Navarese, Bretons, English, Franks, Ruthenians, Bohemians, Bulgarians, Georgians, Syrians, Persian Nestorians, Indians, Copts, Maronites, and many others." (DeHass, History, p. 258. John of Wurzburg list from Reinhold Rohricht edition, pp. 41, 69).

There are villages populated wholly by settlers from other portions of the Turkish Empire in the 19th century. There are villages of Bosnians, Circassians, and Egyptians. -Parkes, James William, History of the Peoples of Palestine, Hammondsworth, Great Britain, 1970, p. 212.

There are very large contingents from the Mediterranean countries, especially Armenia, Greece, and Italy, Turkomen settlers, a fairly large Afghan colony, Motawila, immigrants from Persia, tribes of Kurds, a Bosnian colony, Circassian settlements, a large Algerian element, Sudanese -Encyclopedia Brittanica, 1911 ed.

Felahin? you mean the poor peasents? they LIVED on the land not owned it, the land was owned by absentee turkish and arab land lords who sold the land thinking they had swindled the zionist jews who had immigrated into the region during the 1800's, they sold them swamps and crap arid deserts believing the jews were idiots for buying such land. Surprise tel aviv came from this swamp land thanks to the tireless effort of zionist, now the arabs want to "reclaim the land" they sold at b.s prices because it's nice and all built up. 
 




 Yeah crap, feel retarded right right now, trying to finish up this music history class and debate Jewish topics is annoying.  




 OP it's my bday, screw that complete set crap, lets get wasted reddit style.  




 lolz i know just wanted to fuck with your statement. But yeah their is a generation notion of how people see jews, common traits, nose, fro/curly hair, their is definately some features common to jews but that does not always denote anything look at scarlet johannson a regular blond bomb shell yet she is a jap(jewish american princess, even supports israel and advertises for soda stream) 




 Not really. The concept of a Palestinian is recent, the majority arrived from jordan,egypt and Syria respectively. Their not that diverse and they came in the 1800's. You can look at the majority of their last names in it shows their origins. Stop trying to state they date back 2,000 years that's a lie used by arafat a egyptian from cairo with a syrian uncle who was a nazi.  




 God enough of the arguing. Being a jew was settled in ww2, it's an ethno-religious group, if you dislike this idea of it being an ethnic background as well  as a religion go take it up with the concentration guards. I'm sure isis,hitler and the various other antisemitic movements give a crap if you identify as an ordinary white person they would have still killed you just like the rabbi or the owner of the kosher butcher shop.  




 Yes. That's how the han chinese can tell one of their own from a Uighur and vice versa yet if i go to china my first thought will be all of them look alike no offense to the china men:)  




 Arab refers to speakers of arabic, most of the middle-east is arab and that does not denote ethnic origin 90% of Libya is actually Berber according to genetic studies yet they're denoted as Arabs due to the 6th century arabic conquest. It's more then just a different religion the majority of Palestinian arabs follow Sunni Islam, they do not all come from the same place, they arrived from around the Levant from jordan,egypt,syria and lebanon they also interestingly have a number of eastern Europeans mixed in. 

Also, a new study concluded that the Druze harbor a remarkable diversity of mitochondrial DNA lineages that appear to have separated from each other thousands of years ago. But instead of dispersing throughout the world after their separation, the full range of lineages can still be found within the Druze population.

The researchers noted that the Druze villages contained a striking range of high frequency and high diversity of the X haplogroup, suggesting that this population provides a glimpse into the past genetic landscape of the Near East at a time when the X haplogroup was more prevalent.

These findings are consistent with the Druze oral tradition, that claims that the adherents of the faith came from diverse ancestral lineages stretching back tens of thousands of years.



 




 You would name call me for a cordial post? not really. Catholicism proselytize and so does Hinduism, they want converts and more people to embrace their religion. Listen i'm not stating all jews agree, i've seen and been involved passively in many arguments over how jewish is defined, it's fine if you disagree i'm not trying to put you in a box i'm just going by how i've seen it and how my jewish friends explain it to me which is this:

Jewish is the ethnicity/culture you can be born into and are still apart of even if you leave Judaism the religion. Theirs a notable difference.

Like i said if you don't see yourself as Jewish, that's perfectly fine, your not the first of your ilk to define yourself apart from the religion and culture and you want be the last. Rachel dolezal decided to stop being white, i can stop being black_ racist. lol except if you're a muslim then you could be killed for it but i digress. Either-way not saying people can choose new ethnic backgrounds, what i'm stating is for the majority even if you choose to no longer follow Judaism under jewish law you're still considered jewish.

Karl marx converted to Christianity from Judaism he was still considered Jewish, Trotsky refused to consider himself a jew even to the detriment of jewish people, when a rabbi pleaded for his assistance he refused stating in communism their is no religion. Yet he never attained any higher status in the party because stalin refused to allow a jew into a higher position despite the fact he did not self identify or even recognize himself as a jew or having anything to do with being jewish.

Like i said before you can refuse, you can assimilate, you can be that white dude from Philadelphia but theirs always going to be somebody who will state you're still a jew. That's why it's an ethnic background, i can't stop being black, i can refuse to acknowledge my black identity, cultural identity and stereotypical norms associated with being black in america but guess what i'm still black.

I can understand hating the idea of something forced upon you but theirs certain things we cannot change, you're not a jew according to you, that's great but i don't think that gives you a right to declare it's not a ethnic identity because you don't want to relate to it.    




 We're all genetically related. But no i did not forgot to mention this, because it makes little to no sense, a german jewish or polish family is not related to a polish or german family, jews collectively rarely strayed from their own during centuries in europe, if they did they were ostracized by European communities. 

I have no idea how they're related closely to kurds but druze make sense because their homeland is the golan and lebanon, both close to Israel proper so their ancestors probably go back to the hebrews or Phoenicians which were cousins to the Hebrews.  




 Actually he kind of reinforces the ethnic argument even more and how Judaism is more then just a religion, you can stop going to synagogue but you're still a jew, in no it's not because hitler would of thrown you into the oven regardless if you got rid of your kippah it's because being Jewish is your culture, it's your heritage, your background. You can stop with the dreidel on Hanukkah but you know you want some matzah ball soup, if not then you're a lost cause already.  




 Jews don't refuse, allot of american jews actually have begun marrying outside of their own ethnic group, which has gotten the orthodox in a pissy move and have for decades going back to the early 1900's, which is what pissed off the germans, the germans became fearful the jews were trying to assimilate after claiming for centuries they hated them because they always refused to assimilate anyway this is in part what led to the holocaust.

When jews become apart of the larger culture theirs always a fear among jews that they will lose their respective heritage, religion etc that's why it's sometimes frowned upon by certain jewish communities but never outright hostility, most jews just prefer to marry other jews, i'm black, my mom prefers i would marry a black woman, my sister is now dating a white guy and she's cool with that too now, same concept really some people just like the idea of being able to relate to their childrens future spouse, having their grand children raised in the same culture/religion etc in i have no issue with that as long as you're cool with them coming back one day with someone completely different from your background and still loving them equally. 

In jews don't care to spread judiasm, in actuallity i believe donald trumps daughter not sure got married a year back and married a jew, she converted(ivana trump?) she talked about how hard the conversion process is and that's for a reason, it's not because jews dislike converts they just want them to convert for the right reason and not because they married a jew, i'm not familiar with the entire process so any jew's on here or converts please chime in but i believe that the rabbi refuses them 7 times or something like that during the conversion process to see if they're committed to it. 

Note: previous comment deleted so piggybacking unto yours buddy 




 Race is a social construct, we're humans, in you're lucky in south africa you almost would of been considered "colored" by their standards of the time. In brazil black people would be considered mix due to our white slave ancestors who impregnated slaves, light skinned black people would be considered mulatto's in parts of the Caribbean etc. Ethnic designation is not the best method but it's better then the concept of raced base on physical attributes which can be seen across the globe in various ethnic groups, take for instance Caucasian features found in Ethiopia, whites say obviously we put our genes into them but the reality is the other way around and they came Africa like most of the world population. 




 Actually according to genetic studies most ashkenazim(jews who reside in europe are all 5th cousins or something like that) and mizrahim/sephardim(middleeastern/north african-spanish jews) are closely related genetically with Jews to the point their is no genetic difference, sharing close genetic traits to kurds/druze more so then their arabic cousins. Jews are a ethno-religious group but american/European Jews also frequently see themselves as "white" instead of Semitic, Israeli Jews depending on their ancestry the majority are mizrahim/Sephardi so they would see themselves as more semitic/middle-eastern before white though technically Semitic people are Caucasian either-way the three major groups of jews are all Semitic people descended collectively from the tribes of Israel in genetic testing has shown this repeatedly.

Ethiopian Jews better known as beta Israelite are Jewish by conversion most likely but in Judaism a Jew is a Jew regardless, the moment a mother converts and her children are born they're as Jewish as any other Jewish child born to a family spanning centuries. Same for new converts, the closest to any type of discrimination i have seen from jews against other jews would be during the early years of israel when the mizrahim/sephardim first began to show up after being ethnically cleansed from arab state's, but due to the intermingling/marriages and the mizrahim quickly outnumbering Ashkenazim due to mass immigration, along with Israel having a draft so all Jews end up meeting other jews of different ancestry, theirs not any social or ethnic barrier. I believe the current estimate is in 10 years or so all of israel's jewish population will be collectively mixed to a point where the idea of ashkenazim/sephardi/mizrahim will be meaningless since the new generation will have grand parents from poland, morocco, france, germany,iraq,persia, turkey, egypt, Syria etc it's actually a beautiful thing. 




 Context. Stating the Jew implies something different then saying jews, jewish or we're jews. But it's all about how you collectively phrase it.  




 This is actually not that uncommon, looking back at history, the NAACP was founded by a number of Jews and kept going by Jewish donation's, the freedom riders who were lynched during the civil rights era were Jewish, Jews also fought in the anti-apartheid movement. It's one of the reasons why i support them as a black man, that plus i'm kind of a atheist agnostic in i surprisingly find allot of common traits and interest with Jewish people despite their religious culture/history, the only people i know who don't seem to have this collective hive mind mentality that i see is unfortunately common even among my own people(by hive mind i mean collective reasoning, cultural bias, outrage at certain things etc without taking time in trying to critically evaluate it individually instead basing their opinions on what the majority is stating or doing). Jews on the other-hand are something else:

Theirs a saying that goes, if there are two Jews in a room they have 3 different opinion's. Lolz  




 Funnily enough, Samuel L Jackson was not acting with this role, he actually used to be a crackhead. He once stated the reason why he stopped smoking crack was because he enjoyed acting more then drugs.

 [Spoiler alert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfQJp8RgzHY)  




 My dick. 




 To elaborate why have all examples of Marxism and it's spin offs failed to achieve any of the long term goals expressed by Karl marx, why are the only successful examples of socialism found in capitalistic countries? 




 lmao i'm 21. If i get married this early shoot me, like ha fuck that. SOME PEOPLE BEING THE OPERATIVE STATEMENT! so lets stop insinuating this 1960's pre second wave feminist bullshit about a stay at home wife who has been a loyal virtuous saint who raised the children while emotionally supporting her bread winner husband mythology. 

It's becoming less based on facts, in with the rise of third wave feminism demonizing the stay at home wife role, we should really begin moving away from the idea of alimony when most families are two income households. I can't put financial protections in place in states where they disregard prenups like california, which is utterly bollocks. 

Exactly i never disagreed with the fact she decided to not be a scumbag, but i think people who feel they're entitled to half of my accumulated networth can get bent, nothing wrong with that. I was not referring to her idiot, i was actually giving examples, you assumed instead of reading. In that's the problem when anyone can be awarded half your wealth on such a archaic bullshit notion of marriage in these modern times, the woman who gets screwed over by the dead beat ex husband should be just as pissed as the husband screwed over by the wife, this is not about women it's actually about unequal enforcement of the law based on gender which all people especially feminist should be fighting against. 

Heather mills was a two faced bitch who took advantage of a broken hearted man for her own personal whims, the fact she's even still showing her face without being ashamed is an utter fallacy. Gold digging and bums are a sad state of any society, fuck them man or female, now stop being a sexist pig.  




 Also to address your stupidity. You have zero idea of how their relationship worked or what role she had in his career, wealth and success. Maybe she did nothing and contributed to his stress, which directly led to him eventually divorcing her.. you don't know. So how about you stfu and acknowledge that she did something you morally might disagree with instead of just trying to put her down. 

What we do know however is she married after the fact of his success, he was rich before, in he is more popular in the uk then she was end of story. Those are the only relevant facts. Eitherway i was not attacking her i was attacking people who assume the divorced wife/husband who wants alimony automatically should get it. 

 




 Until you have control of the private industry, then you come for our garden gnomes  




 He means he's going to fuck your couch and then take it, damn commies.  




 Radical left like radical right is wrong, you're radicalizing abstract construct, theoretical solutions and other ideas that when implemented in reality never work out. That's why they're theoretical, in theory socialism, marxism ok honestly just marxism socialism is crap, is awesome but in reality it has never once been implemented correctly, we're inherently fallable.    




 Lolz that's equality. Men feel pissed off when the opposite happens, it's bullshit eitherway but if we're going to keep up the myth of the 1960's era where women stayed at home in raised the little ones then both sides will suffer. Eitherway i'm cool with both. 




 Exactly that time was the 1960's now all women know how to do Is twerk it seems. Lets change the laws stop the bullshit, if you're a bum then that's your own fault.  




 No on reddit everyone can't seem to fathom maybe people are referring to the non stay at home, non committed spouse who did nothing either emotionally, physically or financially and actively was a detriment to the marriage. Jesus the sad thing is you support women who do this then bitch about equality while using the 1960's b.s view of a woman who contributes to the household by cooking and cleaning/raising kids when most of you can't make a pack of ramen lmao

Lets be honest here most relationships are far from a idealistic scenario, if a woman contributed to the marriage in some tangible way pay her but the notion she can get paid just for marrying a guy is bullshit. It's the exact same thing as kevin federline, most guys will call him a bum, however according to these comments most women would support him if he was a woman and that's unbelievable. 




 Once again the majority of women who marry successful men are usually successful themselves, they're not stay at home wives/mothers they have nannies, the women who help or contribute to a successful marriage financially deserve the money, especially if they were their for 30 years but a woman who did nothing or a man who did nothing but spend the wealth is a leach. Lets stop acting like this is the 6th century where women are in the house barefoot raising, oh no wait even then they had maids to raise the children. 




 lmao yeah because heather mills was a cooking, house keeping wife to paul fucking McCartney. Are people this delusional most rich lay about wives/husbands are welfare recipients relying on their rich spouse who contribute nothing but a siphoning of their material wealth.
