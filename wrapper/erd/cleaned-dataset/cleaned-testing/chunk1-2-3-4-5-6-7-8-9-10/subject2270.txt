 I live in a Canadian town along the St Lawrence river.  I moved here with my parents when I was in my early twenties (ya, still living at home, pathetic I know) and until I learned to navigate this retirement community with little to no activity for young people, being along the river was pretty much all I thought this town had going for it.  I have spent long hours walking and biking by that river, getting into some very secluded areas.  Im pretty burly for a girl and sharp enough to be able to just talk myself out of most problems, so during the day I feel safe in a lot of different situations.  And maybe I shouldnt.  

At the time of this encounter I was not even in that secluded of a spot.  I was sitting by a stream in a wooded area of a public park.  Nice day, and there was a bit of walking traffic.  A college class from the school nearby even came down to the stream where I was sitting to get some water samples and catch fish, by the looks of their instruments.  The teacher (prof, whatever) seemed increasingly alarmed as he led his class down to the water.  I gave a head nod like hey hows it going, dont worry, just sitting here watching the water.  Still, he hurried his pupils to another spot along the water looking horrified but I just thought whatever.

Hearing a rustle in the bushes right beside me, I became aware of what the prof had seen and why he was horrified.  I also realised the head nod Id given him made it look like I was in on this, but I honestly had been oblivious.  In the bushes next to me was a woman, which was confusing because she was clearly playing with her penis.  Had breasts, was presenting as a woman but was clearly a man.  She looked over at me, then down at her erection, and in my stupor of disbelief she had time to actually point to it, like look!  

As I noped out, I actually said nope! and started climbing up the hill to the path.  He (?) jumped out of the bushes, still playing with himself and trying to get hard in a hurry.  His face was really focused as he came at me and I was really glad it was me in this situation and not some tiny matchstick girl because looks dont scare me and I give as good as I get.  Like, Ive been in scuffles.  This guy was especially puny, but you really never know whos got a knife or blood diseases or just how nuts someone might be, so I was just rathering not and hurried up the hill.  

I guess I could have screamed something at him and in retrospect it really weirds me out how quiet the scene was.  I guess we were both just focused.  As luck would have it, the students and teacher were still close by.  Its funny, I didnt call for help or think to walk up to them for help (which is too bad, because maybe we could have caught the guy), I thought to walk through them to dislodge this creepy predator.  Which I did, and it worked.  I then thought I really should keep looking back as I head to the police station and report because no effing way am I leading this guy to my house if he is following.  Still, my number one priority was getting the hell away.

I reported the flashing, gave a statement and all.  The officer asked if Id seen a backpack around when the guy was in the bushes.  At the time I said no but looking back, there was a ton of rope in a coil and some other things that Im not really sure of.  I guess the makings of a rape kit.  There was a possibility this guy had been following me and knew when Id be by the water, which I find unlikely because my routine is incredibly random and I dont even know when Ill be by the water.  The officer guaranteed me this guy would do something like this again and hopefully theyd get him before he really got serious.  Makes me wish Id tried to beat the shit out of him as an early deterrent.    

So, fledgling rapist, lets not meet again.      
 





























 i don't really know how else to put it, (s)he was a gender bender. 




 me too!  it was a real shock and trying to make sense of what i was seeing took a minute.  i must have done three or four double-takes before it sank in! 
























 in a medicine pouch around my neck every day. 




 My first real job was as a PSW in a nursing home on a native reserve.  PSW for the uninitiated stands for Personal Support Worker, but we in the industry have agreed its more like Professional Shit Wiper.  Im the girl who wipes your grandmas ass, basically.  Of course, I also bathe her, feed her, clothe her, wheel her around and sometimes I even get to talk to her.  Most residents, though, are functionally non-verbal.  Nursing homes provide the service of prolonging a lingering death and over time its easy to look at people with their clawed hands and open, gurgling mouths as not fully human.  The work eventually will erode your soul.
 
Shit wiping aside, the island reserve itself posed some issues.  On the island, most people let their dogs loose maybe for days at a time.  This used to be pretty common elsewhere but its fallen out of favour the last fifty years or so.  And its not hard to see why when these dogs form terrifying packs.  Ill admit Im afraid of dogs.  And there was one around the nursing home who got to me the worst. 

I only ever got a good look at him during the day to see he was a black, ragged thing with one ear almost completely gone, a crooked tail that lay dead and limp behind him and he always seemed to have a new leg to limp on every day.  At night he was much worse.  He was just there in the shadows, scratching at something or another or making chewing, crunching noises eating god knows what.  He wasnt a big one, but the other dogs seemed to give him space.  I could have imagined it, but I always seemed to hear a growling whenever I was out at night taking a smoke break.

I happened to mention this phobia to a resident in conversation.  This man was our golden boy, being pretty much the only resident who was almost zero care.  He could dress, walk, go outside, eat, toilet, and bathe himself: the man had it all.  Oh, I know that dog, hes fine.  But tell you what, Ill bring you a rock from the river next time Im there, he told me that rivers good luck.  A rockd be a good charm. Keep the dogs away.  I mentioned that this resident could bathe himself, but his unfortunate habit was to do so in a nearby river, leaving him smelling worse than if he had not bathed at all.  Id been told to discourage this, but to be honest, I was desperate for a magical rock, even just to throw it at the dog.

We often had staff meetings to discuss making any changes in care plans they are called; basically, the focus was how to change a residents daily routine if they were deteriorating.  Help them into their new, more limited life.  A lot of these meetings were more like gossip than care, plus I was new and low in rank so I didnt have much say in anything which is why I would just zone out.  Okay, lets talk about Roger, my ears perked, Its got to stop, hes getting to a point where he could easily fall and drown in that river.  My thoughts exactly!  We should have stopped this months ago, the smell really is too much.  That water is crawling with all sorts of bacteria and I dont think hes well enough to fight off an infection, god forbid.  There was more talk, but only one verdict: Roger had lost his outdoor privileges.      

I was there the afternoon they broke it to Roger and I can tell you he was devastated.  Heartbroken.  Furious.  Heres your fucking rock. he thrust into my hand a small oval stone when I made my rounds.  Id never heard him swear before.  This was a rare moment where I could forget I had a million butts to wipe and actually connect one-on-one.  His eyes were welling up and he quickly turned them towards the window.  Men at any age dont want to be seen crying.  What gem of wisdom, as a twenty something, could I pass to an elder whod just lost his freedom?  All I could do was take his hand, catch his eye and make him see that I shed a tear of my own.

It was the evening shift, two to ten and, for a change, the director of care would be keeping the same hours.  She was more of a nine-to-five, but she took the occasional late shift.  Mostly I was impressed at Rogers self-control for not wanting her blood since she was the one who took his freedom and he knew it.  If anything, he seemed very focused and calm.  I took this as a sage reaction, like a man coming to terms.  It was a very quiet night, very quiet until Roger started howling.  Great bellows of howling.  Howling, howling, nothing could stop him, we swarmed with all manner of restraints to keep him under some sort of control.  He kept going, until, vary faintly, I was sure I heard a howl from outside almost lost in the commotion.  Roger stopped.  No more struggling, no more howling, he just gave in to the staff.

The director of care left early, hoping, I think, that Roger would be less agitated if she were removed.  She really did have his care at heart.  I was taking a much needed smoke break during a momentary lull in action.  The evening had gone from very quiet to unbelievably busy after Rogers outburst.  It seemed everybody was going to have a restless night.  Goodbye um Carol!  See you tomorrow! the director waved on her way past.  She got my name wrong, but I was new and, to her, pretty much faceless anyway.  She made her way across the parking lot in the dying light when a shadow went wrong.

First one shadow went wrong.  Cast by a tree, a large and tall shadow swiveled from the trees left to its right as though the source of light had completely shifted.  A cars shadow leaked like grease spilling out from under its carriage.  As though jumping ship, the directors own shadow vanished.  She stopped walking.  All the shadows were not only moving towards her, they were forming a patch of darkness in which she had a shrinking spotlight.  As her own shadow returned, the spotlight vanished.  In complete darkness, I could hear her screams and the exact snarling crunching shewing sounds of black dog in the shadows.  I dont remember deciding to make a noise, but a whimper came out.  If a shadow could look at you, thats what the shadow did.  If it could smell you, thats what it did.  If it could decide not to attack you, thats what it did.            

It should have been a relief for the shadows to dissipate, but all it meant was that the horror of the attack came in view.  In a CPR course I had taken, we had discussed when not to start CPR, the idea being you should always start unless it was plainly obvious there was no hope.  There would be no CPR.  In a stupor, I staggered inside only to be greeted by Roger.  Good thing you had the rock, huh?      
























 THANK you.  it's slim pickings out there!  don't want to end up 30,000 dollars in debt for a bachelor of arts.  




 you're absolutely right.  i may not have handled this well in telling my story. 
























 hahaha!  yup, nothing like a kick to the dick.  a friend of mine goes to that college now and i really want to find that prof to tell him the whole story, it really bothers me. 




 i didn't want it to be the focus of the story or paint transgender folk as creepy or wrong, but it was what it was.
well, i didn't learn a single thing because i go down by the river still all the time.  haven't had a single problem.  not going to live in fear because of one random weirdo. 
























 thank you!  i definitely don't look at Roger the same way anymore. 




 wow that's pretty mystical.  good thing the wolf was such a gentle teacher! 
























 oh, i also am an animal lover, i just don't get dogs.  i dunno, they always just look like they're about to bite me.  some of my friends have pet rats, and some people are creeped out by them but we have parties where the goal is specifically to cuddle rats on the couch the whole night.  they are really super sweet animals. 




 well maybe.  my parents are pretty happy to have me around, though, i do a lot of things for them. 
























 Hes in the trees, I know it.  Hes IN the trees.  Those long sharp branches, hes tipping an entire oak to rake them along the shingles of the cabin.  Hes tracing my name as he scrapes, I can hear him scratching Thompson.   He wants to peel the roof back and open this place up like a tin of sardines.  He wants me to run.  Hes using the twigs now, tapping against the window like a child at a fish bowl.  Hello in there, he says, Im waiting.  But the cabin is safe.  He cant come in.  Thats what the ritual was all about; we were making a sacred place.  It was supposed to be filled with light, it was supposed to be refuge but we released him.  God help us, we released him.     




 what a vignette!  
























 When the kids left home, I took the empty nest thing pretty literally. I love animals and Id always wanted a parrot, but really had never had the time.  I dont use euphemisms like no longer with us so Ill just say it: my husband is dead.  Heart attack five years ago.  After working two teenagers through that sort of loss, and myself as well, I cant say I ever had much me time.  When the kids left, I felt a kind of freedom I hadnt had since I was eighteen years old and just on the verge of independence.  I was almost giddy the day I went to buy Henry. 

Henry was a beautiful yellow naped amazon.  He loved to talk and picked up words so quickly that at times it was almost scary.  He heard me on the phone once.  Okay, Linda, thanks for calling whats that?...  Oh of course!...  haha!...  Alright, bye Linda!  Bye Linda! Henry called out.  Henry!  Clever boy!  Do I really sound like that?  Henry was just that good, he could pick a phrase up after hearing it only once and he could mimic the oddest noises almost perfectly.  But since he was an old man of thirty, pretty much birdy middle aged when I bought him from a lovely young couple, it could also be confusing trying to determine if some things were from his old life, or from around my own house.  

My keyboard, for instance.  Id never played it for him, but there was one specific beat he was always mimicking that I had never heard on any other keyboard.  Mine was so old, the beat was pretty much a relic that had been replaced by something cooler on new models.  I was certain I hadnt played it, but where else would he have picked it up?  There were other noises that made sense, but also could not really be explained.  The sound of footsteps going up my stairs like someone was running.  I know the sound of my stairs and even for non-vocal sounds, Henry was a perfect mimic.  I know the sound of someone running up those stairs from twenty-some years of kids flying up and down.  But I hadnt run up those stairs in years.

Henry kept up with the strange noises.  The attic door being pulled down had a specific thump and creak that was very distinct.  I hadnt been up there in at least a year.  Songs from music boxes I absolutely had not played since getting Henry were some of his favourites.  Whats more, Henry sometimes made voices that I could swear I heard at the market or on the bus, but that he could never have picked up.  Certainly not at my house.  

It all came to a head after coming home once to find a cigarette still burning in an ash tray on my coffee table.  I finally pieced together what was going on, and I was terrified.  I felt crazy just thinking it, but I knew: someone was in my house with me.  They had played my keyboard while I was away, they had run up the stairs when they knew I was coming and hid in the attic.  Im not crazy, these things happen.  Ive seen it on the news.  I called the police immediately.

After a thorough inspection of the house, the police verified my suspicion.  There was almost a nest up in my attic where someone had been squatting, for a while from the looks of it.  No person was found, they figured hed been lucky enough to slip out at just the right time.  Change your locks, maybe get a security system installed was cold comfort from the police.  Call us again if you see anything unusual.

Things changed after that.  Especially with Henry.  I couldnt stand him making those noises.  Every time he made the attic door sound, my heart raced.  I was nervous enough as it was and Henry was giving me panic attacks on a regular basis.  I couldnt keep him.  I asked the couple who had sold him to me whether they could take him again.  I didnt need my money back, I just wanted him to go to a good home.  To my relief, they were happy to take him off my hands and we arranged a pick-up date.

Im counting down to when my nest will empty again.  I woke up just a few hours ago to Henrys staircase running noise and attic thump.  Ugh, Henry, go back to sleep!  I called out.  He cant be gone too soon.  But wait, its Saturday, right?  And the pickup was Friday   
 




 nice twist! 
























 i don't know if it was intentional, but i loved the way the word 'shots' seemed to be repeated a lot towards the end.  it was like a secret build-up to the actual revelation that they were actually shooting people.  also, the tone was kind of funny, in a good way. 




 Who said you could die? Not me. No, you don't have permission to die yet."  My boss was a real asshole.  You kids today, you all think the world owes you a living.  Well let me tell you something, when I was your age I didnt mouth off at work and complain to everyone about how many stab wounds I had or where my insulin was.  No, I took it like a man.  You can die on you own time, but this is work and you come here to work.  Now get out there and takes those orders

Welcome to nnn Burger World.  Can I take your uuunnn order?  I kept cringing over the pain in my stomach from a lunch that had probably been tainted.  My boss, see, he fed us all the recently expired burgers and special sauce for our lunch breaks.  And only half price! hed say.   




 this is one of the best stupid things i've ever read.   




 Hey said some guy Id never met before as I was walking alone through a foggy alley filled with needle drug users and ominous men wearing trench coats who kept handing me brochures about how wonderful South Korea is and how nobody ever gets trafficked there.  I could tell this guy was creepy right off, probably because of the nametag on his shirt that said hello, my name is: creepy.  Is your cell phone charged? he asked.  Well, it has like five minutes on it still.  You know, just enough time to make brief contact with someone in case I was in trouble, but no so long I could explain specifically what was happening or where I was.  Would you like to come back to my house, no questions asked without letting anyone know where you are?  Sure! I said.

Next thing you know, I was blindfolded in the back of a car.  This is just like a surprise party! I said.  The blindfold only came off when I was in creepys apartment.

The walls were plastered with pictures of butts.  Looking more closely, I was horrified.  Hey!  What are all these pictures of my butt doing on your wall!  Well, creepy replied, its better than looking at your face.  Listen, are we going to do this or not?  He was brandishing a butchers knife now.  I do believe a thirty second head start is customary.  Fine, but I get first stab. Agreed.

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!! I screamed. 
 




 oh my god i love this. 




 maybe they do need me... i never thought of that. 




 agreed, but i'd say a dog is more for personality.  when i retire, i plan to pick one up from the SPCA just to keep me active.  support your local shelter! 




 Just what my daughter said! 




 i'm guessing the creep who lived in my attic and i had the same bus route. 




 i've got a cockatiel now.  they don't really talk, they just whistle.  he's a pretty good alarm. 




 it's happened to a few people around the world, so i think it's a pretty universal fear!
