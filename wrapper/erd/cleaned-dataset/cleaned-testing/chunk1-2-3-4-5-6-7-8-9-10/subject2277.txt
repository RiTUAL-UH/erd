 Police Constables in Ontario make about 90K a year as a top base salary.

The average Ontario salary is 49K.

He is in fact way off with his 5 times #.

Suspended cops get no extra pay.  Just base salary.
 




 If there's no money in the government coffers, there's no pension.

How could you **not** know that? 




 Do you take any solace knowing his corruption was investigated, Prosecuted and he was fired by his own police forces internal affairs?

They did the right thing, It's the law in Ontario that suspended officers retain their pay. 




 Metal poles are deadly weapons.

 




 Old people are terrified.

Middle aged are scared.

Young people want to party in the Street. 




 Guards were likely paid not to notice. 

It's how things operate in Mexico. 




 Very often when you make a bad loan, you can collect by seizing real property, garnish wages or accept a negotiated new payment plan.

You don't necessarily have to walk away empty handed.  Neither does Germany.

Pay what you owe.  Problem solved. 




 What you call pushing insane terms, I call pushing realistic terms. 




 No love for that genre, but that video was hilarious.   




 You find the results online, it was studied...by this man.  Get a hint of what's in the dust if you read the story.

"Your" dust isn't a rare specimen that likely won't deviate greatly from the mean. 




 I can't even imagine the crazy that /r/conspiracy will come up with. 




 You can still carry concealed.

By your silly argument, every business in Canada is regularly shot up by armed bandits, what with our strict gun control laws and all. 




 You can't just fire all the union members.

You can shut your business down though.

 




 It's not a community garden.

It's a privately owned garden on the city owned easement. 




 Hmm, seems like you could have asked him. 





























 From the story, OPS is the 3rd most understaffed in the entire country.

Those 130 accommodated cops don't help. 




 No.

You must reside in Ontario. 




 From the story;

10% of the OPS is on light duties;

"That senior officer told CFRA there are **130 officers** who cannot do their regular tasks because of things like injury or pregnancy.

"That's 10 per cent of all our sworn staff," the senior officer told CFRA. "That's huge."

I'm told morale is horrible in the OPS, undoubtedly 10% of a force getting out of regular jobs doesn't help. 




 'Outside Canada


We no longer process Canadian Police Certificates for persons living outside of Canada. Please refer to theRCMPfor this service.'

From the Ops website on the background check FAQ

 




 The fact that this even went to trial is a travesty.

The police and the Crown clearly have too much time on their hands.

This man's life is in shambles. 




 Go to the bank in person, see a teller and you'll be able to withdraw some cash. 




 Free speech isn't free if we self censor out of fear of violent reprisal. 




 There are no laws governing abortion in Canada...where I live.

Medical guidelines yes, laws no. 




 People cheering on those who would make Death threats in response to provocative and robust speech should hold their heads in shame.

 




 A fetus alone in the womb will become a baby.

Semen alone will **never** become a baby. 




 Semen needs to fertilize an egg.

Semen can never become a human on its own.

I've honestly never heard someone comparing semen to a fetus before.


I'm pro-choice, but your analogy isn't convincing. 




 I'm prochoice, but the **rare** late term abortions where the baby **would** survive outside the womb, I find quite distressing 

 




 Start.ca

Im perfectly happy with them and I have a VoIP phone with them as well. 




 TIL factual recounting of real events constitutes an attack. 




 Won't make a difference to any claim. 




 I'm happy to see that the police investigated themselves, prosecuted him internally under the PSA, convicted him and then fired him, which was upheld by the OCPC. ( Remember these cases when Canadians claim cops can't investigate themselves)

There **should** be a mechanism in place to suspend officers without pay on a case by case basis.

No such mechanism exists, so dirty and corrupt cops get their top base salary of 90K while they work their way through the system.

So, the government needs to legislate this power, that is currently unavailable to police Chiefs.

The Ontario Association of Chiefs want the ability to suspend with pay on a case by case basis. 
























 If you walk in public, you have no expectation of privacy.

 




 In Canada,( where I live) the courts have ruled there is no expectation of privacy in our yards.

Else your neighbor would get arrested for looking into your backyard.

I don't believe cops jerking off in helicopters is a reasonable concern.

To answer your question, you have zero expectation of privacy on city streets. 




 Probably because she kicked him and then he threw her to the ground, which is self defense.

Was it excessive force?  Possibly.  I believe he could have accomplished a similar end result ( her being on the ground) with less force and her face not hitting the ground.

Assault?  I say no, cause she kicked him and he defended himself. 




 I admit that I'm left a bit taken aback at how positively dreadful some people are online and how they always seem to find each other, so that they can tear people down collectively.

I've been online since 94 and the viciousness has been gradual.

 




 No.

Parents no longer have a parental duty when a child turns 16.

Youth bureau can help, but child services...no. 




 16 is the age you can be kicked out on your own.

 




 You don't suppose there may be an entirely different explanation as to why the 17 year old was booted out? 




 Do you have an expectation of privacy in public?  




 He wasn't sued.

This is criminal court.

 




 It's in the story.

The Fraser Institute. 




 You seem to spend a lot of time on /r/drugs.

I'm a recovering alcoholic and when I was drinking, my main focus was on getting loaded.

Once I got myself clean and sober, I was able to focus my energies on the actual things in my life that mattered and clearly see the big picture.

I also saved a lot of money getting clean, quit smoking too, which also saved me some money.

I wish you well.

 




 I was specifically talking about solicitors.  I'll listen to kids / students or other legitimate members of my neighbourhood.

 




 It has not expired.  You literally just made up your comment about big bad pharma keeping Viagra pricey.

'Pfizer's patent protecting Viagra from generic competition expires in April 2020, but Teva Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. will be allowed to launch its generic version in the United States on Dec. 11, 2017.' 









 Don't ask to see ID.

Just say 'NO thanks' and close the door.  **Never engage door to door solicitors**

My strategy has worked for going on 16 years as a home owner 





























 For arguments sake;

I have a childhood friend, I am 40 now, who I have lost touch with the last 3 or 4 years.

If he died tomorrow, how could I possibly prove that I was friends with him? I do not have a single photograph of him and I together.

 




 You wouldn't believe them anyway.

You know it. 




 I vacation in Florida every year.

Never even met an American police officer.

Worst police state ever. 




 I never experienced it.  Yet Reddit and twitter are bursting at the seems with it. 




 Some kids cause tremendous disruption, conflict and stress in the home, despite having caring parents who have other children who are well behaved.

If they will not respect the rules of the home, set them free.

Some parents are horrible.

Yes, sometimes that is the difficult, but necessary action.

 




 Change the internet?

No.

Call the cunts out for their cunt behavior and stop telling the targets of their collective disdain that it's not a problem?

Yes. 




 Why would you want to block the number? 




 It was absolutely not worse.  Commonly visited websites, unlike commonly visited websites of today, (twitter, Reddit, Facebook,) were not chalk full of poisonous vitriol, anger and insult as they are today.

 




 Human nature has changed, as for the first time in history, there is an easily accessible and anonymous way to heap scorn on others you don't like without any consequence. 




 Did she have the ability not to kick him?



He took her down too hard I think.
I also don't believe she should have kicked him. 




 If I'm 15 and hundreds of people are collectively mocking me, both strangers and my peers and it's spilling over into school...

That shit's gotta hurt something fierce.

I'm 40 and when I was 15, there was no such thing as people posting a picture of you online and saying horrible shit about your looks and some telling you to kill yourself.

It just wasn't a thing...

And then you say it's the kid being mocked who has the problem and not the vicious people finding pleasure in tearing someone down? 




 If you didn't care ( as you claim) then why did you try to block his calls?

Does not add up. 




 It wasn't always like this.  So many people openly and so vocally being shitty to each other wasn't really around 20 years ago online. 




 Why don't trolls control how we act when interacting in person with each other?

Why do the trolls get to dictate the conversation online? 




 It wasn't always this way.   Seriously, Ive been online since 94. ( interesting you chose that year)

Things have changed and in cases related to disagreement, not for the better.  

You can't disagree with popular sentiment on Reddit, else you'll be insulted, ridiculed and cursed at.

It's pretty strange, as people don't act like that in real life. 




 16 is the age a youth can be kicked out.

You don't believe that there are youths who are so destructive, so abusive, so disruptive and so intent on disrespecting the rules of the home that a parent is not wise to give their child the freedom they so desire by taking away the privilege of living rent free in the home?

I do believe there are unfortunately youths who do in fact deserve to be removed from their homes due to the choices they make and their behaviors.

 
























 It's not the case for everyone who died.

That's the entire point

You can't apply your blanket means of proof to everyone who dies. 




 You won't have to pay lawyer fees.

 Check the laws in your State, eviction is usually a lengthy process.


I recommend talking to your landlord

Did you check out payday loans?
 




 It's a privately owned website 

They get to decide. 




 His proof is unreasonable.  I have life long friends whom I am in no photographs.

People I work with every day, no pictures.

Neighbours I've lived beside for ten years and with whom I socialize, no pictures!

Most 40 year old men don't go around taking pictures of friends, colleagues and neighbours. 




 No one is censoring that vile material, it's still there. 




 It's a shitty neighborhood, no question.

Dangerous?  I wouldn't say that, but not safe either. 




 Why wouldn't they want them up front? 




 It'll be quite straightforward.

 




 I have cousins and friends with whom I have no photos.

Hell, I've a cousin I haven't seen in 30 years.

 




 I thought salvia was that drug people do...once? 




 Redditors get the Reddit they deserve. 




 If all the assholes and trolls fucked off to voat, mission accomplished. 




 Pics of dead kids = vile.

Pics of happy puppies = not vile 




 ...and if one of them is dead.  What then?

 




 You're never allowed to complain about being downvoted for the sin of respectfully disagreeing with popular sentiment.

 
























 How else would they communicate the message quickly and assuring everyone heard it? 




 I grew up rural and on a farm and went to school with rural / farmer kids. Can't recall ever seeing a casing at school. 




 Lockdown = kids are locked in classroom, crouched silently hiding in a corner.  Police immediately attend looking for threat.

Secure school = classrooms and outside doors locked, business as usual inside ie: teaching. 

It was a secure school, the headline is completely incorrect.

Edit - who downvotes fact?  A lock down and a secure school are two different things.  The headline says the school was in lockdown, but the story clearly states it was a secure school.

I don't give two shits about Karma.   Just puzzled who would downvote a factual contribution to the thread. 




 PTSD and depression are comparable to an itchy ass?

 




 How much are your property taxes a month? 




 You've drawn a conclusion the men were executed.

What evidence convinced you so? 




 There's an alien peddling a bicycle at the centre of the earth, which makes the earth spin.

Let's discuss it.

If you disagree or downvote me, your a paid shill or a troll.
 




 Staged with crisis actors.

 




 Five months before she was found hanged in a Texas jail cell, Sandra Bland posted a video on the internet stating she had depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.

 Why does a flat earth need to be discussed?

Do you discuss whether or not the delusions of a schizophrenic are real? 




 Five months before she was found hanged in a Texas jail cell, Sandra Bland posted a video on the internet stating she had depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.


http://abc7chicago.com/news/naperville-woman-who-died-in-texas-jail-claimed-depression-ptsd/855439/ 




 Your take on the situation is quite bizarre  




 I'd have thought the same at 30. 




 I've hit an age where I watch a video like that and I just shake my head. 




 What about pulling them all and getting dentures? 




 Ok 
























 The context is the population.

There are 112,374,333 people who live in the state in question, Maharashtra.

58,243,056 are men.

In 6 months, 1300 farmers have killed themselves.

" So in just six months this year, the farmer suicide toll has already touched 66% of the 1,981 cases recorded in the entire year of 2014."

Last year, 1981 farmers killed themselves in that state.

Yep, it's a problem.

That enough context for you?

 Oh my God.  What will the RCMP do?

/s

Edit;

Everyone, it's OK.

It's back up.  Phew.  The country and the RCMP are back in business. 




 They're going to DDOS a website?  

You'd think they'd wait for the facts to come out. 




 What's with all the speculation?

We literally don't know what transpired. 




 You're actually defending a "female" with a biologically **male** body, fighting females with biologically female bodies?

Two elite class athletes in the same weight class, the male will be immensely stronger. 




 Good God, there are significant physical differences between men and women.

This is wrong and an embarrassment.

Wait until an adult decides they're really a 10 year old child and starts entering kids karate tournaments.

 Let's see the actual numbers.  Post your source. 




 A troublesome brain drain?  Care to provide a link.

I've not heard of this mass exit of the educated class and professionals

No. 




 Longer hugs. 




 I don't think you know what an 'as is' sale is.
 




 So rare for married people to be happy.

Congratulations. 




 Negligent.

Losing track of a loaded magazine is negligent.

Negligence;

'
Is a failure to exercise the care that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in like circumstances.'

 




 The actual law allows gun owners to lose track of loaded magazines and then unknowingly transport those loaded magazines into schools?

Are you sure?

 




 The five independent witnesses who gave statements to the police, they're in on the cover up as well?

 




 Losing track of a loaded magazine and it falling out of your pockets in public is negligent.
 
























 I live in Ottawa, there's perfectly made poutine all over the city. 




 'I should try out reddit because I need more faith in humanity.'

Don't venture into any of the default subs, else you'll lose whatever faith in humanity that remains. 




 I thought nothing existed outside the universe?

Which means there's an end, no? 




 Why did Hawking say the universe is infinite?  How can an expanding universe go on forever? 




 Murder is the deliberate taking of life without justification.

A Canadian can kill another person and be justified under the law in having done so.

Killing is certainly a better fit, as we do not yet know if the shooting was justified or not. 




 You're not responsible for unauthorized CC transactions, so no need to worry. 




 Ah, so in your perception of reality, no circumstance could have occurred where lethal force was justified?

Bizarre.

 




 Murder? Based upon what?

Do you have access to all of the evidence and witness statements?

I've the distinct impression you've made up your mind, despite not having access to the totality of the evidence. 




 Good.

We need to win this election and handing our opponents ammunition is unwise, when you consider how fickle undecided voters are. 




 Another petition, to stop an entertainer...from entertaining?

People really need to get a fucking life. 




 That's a short haired woman. 




 Where is the picture of his face?

I'm told he's been the news for unrelated hypnosis type things in the past.

The women get their faces on the net, why not him? 




 The NDP **will never** hold office unless they shed their socialist, big government  spending  roots.

I am a member and regular donor to the NDP and am both pleasantly surprised and thrilled at the direction our future PM is taking the party.

If you want to win, you must campaign from the centre, as you will lure both centre right and centre left undecided voters that are necessary for a win.

Do you want change or do you want more Harper?

If you want change, follow Mulcairs lead.

Edit - For my party, the fringe left ( which is in abundance on/r/Canada) does as much harm to it, as the fringe right does to Harpers brand.

I know, the truth hurts.  If I wanted to turn an undecided voter off my party, I'd sent her to /r/Canada. 




 ...or maybe he attacked a cop with a knife.

What do I know, I'm just an RCMP paid shill. 




 What are they protesting?

 




 I've  a theory, some people like some things  and other people like different things. 
























 Taking 10% from gambling revenue is criminal.

Having a poker game in your home is legal.

Having a poker game in your home and taking 10% of every pot is illegal.

You didn't know this?

 




 Glad she's dealing with her addiction, but wow, what an odd looking couple.

Am I allowed to say that? 









 How so?

You can leave the building to smoke at any time. 




 ...but operating a black market gambling operation does  




 You didn't see through the hyperbole?

The cops actually took the time to find the wife to tell her to go back to the house and unlock the door, so they didn't have to kick the door in. 




 Failing to declare income is a violation of the tax act.

Operating a near million dollar black market gambling book is illegal.

Calm down. 




 He's been doing it since the early 90's.

He made choices and now he's facing consequences for those choices.

What is it you dislike?

The police are holding him to account for the choices he made.

 




 So every cop who ever gets in trouble is guilty?

That's your standard? 




 I read the entire story.

He never once advised he was declaring the income to the IRS.

Even more damning, I now see he tweaked his suggestion, that on top of the winners, he recommended **all participants** gift him 10%.

If you think he was paying tax on his gambling operation, I've some swamp land in Florida I'd like to sell you. 




 'That winners, if they were satisfied with the experience of playing in the pool, give him a "gift" amounting to 10 percent of the amount they collected.'

I know a lot of you **hate** cops, but he was operating outside the law.

The cops should have just ignored his tax free nearly million dollar gambling operation?

Edit - note to self, do not question the prevailing opinion or suffer downvotes.  Lol.

Does anybody else hate cops?  They're totally the worst.  Fucking pigs interfering with this guys black market gambling operation.   There I'm one of you now, upvote guyz! 




 On phone.

If you don't have herbicides, **you must water regularly.**

That's what I meant. 




 Chip stands in Ottawa serve up the real deal, cheese curds and fresh cut fries.

Even Costco serves real Quebec cheese curds with their poutine.

I sincerely do not believe any reputable food truck or restaurant would serve anything but the real deal in Ottawa.

 




 Did you know you can't grow a weed free lawn without chemical herbicides and regular watering?

So screw it.  Let the weeds grow and my days of toiling over that little patch of grass and spending hundreds of dollars are over.

I have a Japanese lilac tree, columbrian maple tree and a hybrid Apple tree + 3 pyramid cedars + 2 lilac bushes, one of which is a beautiful 10 feet tall.



That's plenty of oxygen.

My kids play at the park. 




 

Without chemical herbicides at my disposal in Ontario for low cost, I now accept that my lawn is going to go to hell and one day, I will simply have to completely landscape my front and back yards, as the lawn is going to turn into a pasture.

Water my lawn?  Ha-ha, no. 




 To be frank, if you read the news regularly, cops are often convicted, fired and / or punished for their misdeeds.

When 
























 I created a fake account for shits and giggles.  I basically made myself into a  hideously undateable, underemployed, heavy smoker with addiction issues.

I wanted to see if I got unsolicited replies from hot women.

Yes, yes I did.

The site is a fucking joke. 




 Hm, probably have man hands on that keyboard. 




 I think your handsome in a 'professor' looking kind of way.  I like the beard, goes good with your shaved head and the glasses are nice.

Maybe consider making an appointment with your family doctor and telling him how you feel? 




 I've read what you had to say, re watched the video and you're right, he did point to the side walk area.

I stand corrected.

I don't know if he was necessarily deliberately getting her out of the view of the camera or if he simply wanted to deal with her off the roadway.

Either way, you're correct, he told her to go over there.

 




 You look good.  The little hair you kept on your chin, it suited you. 









 By her own admission on a video she posted five months before, she said she suffers from depression and PTSD.

I can't pretend to know what's going through her mind, but those two illnesses can drastically change ones mindset.

I'm not saying her arrest was lawful, just raising the possibility that she may have still been ill. 




 It's pretty clear to me she chose to walk in the direction she was walking and wasn't even looking at the cop when she walked off camera.

Watch it again.  She's literally walking off camera by her own volition and isn't looking at the cop.
 




 ...and he'll have to convince a judge / jury of that. 




 They did follow through with the charges.

She plead guilty.

That's the definition of following through. 




 The legislation is clear when it becomes illegal and the courts have made multiple rulings further clarifying it.

 




 Police shoot every single person with a knife, unless they're a chick?

You sure about that? 




 I'm an ex smoker.

Smoking is fucking filthy. 




 Nicotine gum, snus or even better, quit.

CTC does not owe smokers a smoke break.

I'm not allowed to leave ( and re-enter) for a benign reason, neither can smokers.

Smoking isn't an emergency. 




 Yes, I understand.

How is a smoker being denied a right to smoke?

Smokers are fortunate CTC even allows smoking on their property. 




 I've a 2400 sq/ft home natural gas furnace and finished basement with a 5th bedroom.
