 Owen libary is my favorite. 6th floor has a great view and usually empty, and the downstairs has the best computers.  Basement of Holland Terrell is also great. or if you like some distraction the first floor of  the CUB is pretty nice

 "I traded it in for  a microphone"

"Yeah I can see that" 




 I'm not the biggest football expert but.. I'm afraid this is a little too true. I think momentum is important for us and Nevada is a school we should be able to beat. Of course if the WSU team that played Rutgers played Nevada I think we would've won. I do however think our home game schedule will be to our advantage since they're against some tough teams but home field advantage will be in our favor. Go Cougs! 




 Not just landfills but the middle of the Pacific Ocean 




 I'm rewatching the show and I just finished Season 7. Over the seasons I think he is one of the most diverse characters  and although it doesn't always make sense I love that he switches persona's each season especially after he gets back from corporate. 




 Don't tell Ayn Rand 




 That's awesome! Now if only the buses were even a little bit on time 



















 I've seen the show too many times so I tend to get seasons mixed up but I'd say for most the show Marshal is a corporate lawyer which according to the show/real life makes a lot of money. Plus Lily has a teacher's salary albeit not great but still. So why are they always seemingly broke? Even if Lily spent her entire paychecks on clothes I don't see how they'd be tight on money, and Marshal's school debt would be bad but I doubt he doesn't have a plan on it. Any thoughts?

 What year in med school are you? I'm hopefully going to pharmacy school next year. Just waitin on that email to come 




 I just hate how throughout the series we're led to believe that the whole gang is always together. Uncle barney and Aunt Robin are always prevalent. But no turns out they all pretty much go their separate ways.

Barney's part too. He just becomes a total loser at the end. Perfect month? I'm sorry but no. And then he has a kid with a random ho whom we know nothing about and everything is fine and dandy. Why have we never heard about this kid before. Wouldn't that kid be Ted's kid's friend? Total shortcut in writing 




 I thought the way it was written was classic himym, definitely not the top 5 worst episodes 




 Anything autism related. I don't even know why that gets discussed on Reddit 




 You may need to explain this further 









 Since when is all of france the size of NYC? 




 That's how I got here. I remember back in 8th grade I had a Coach Z shirt. So awesome 




 I have an actual cat, is that cool? Anyone? 




 That's true but at least Barney doesn't introduce the girls to them. I mean I don't break up with someone then show off the latest person I'm seeing to my ex 




 Ok, thank you for actually coming up with a reason. Of course I wouldn't discriminate against other races. I don't think there's a country in the world where every single person is unattractive  




 Are you trying to make me sad?

 I don't get your logic why is it necessary to be attracted to every single Asian group? I mean if you think Italian girls are hot does that mean you have to love Polish girls too just because they're all European? 




 My parents are putting me through college and I thank them all the time. I mean it literally wouldn't be possible otherwise. Working full time at the same time as college wouldn't be enough, and that would be darn near impossible anyways 




 As a college student I can say there's a direct correlation between time spent studying and grades on tests. However I don't really get hw I just have to memorize tons of stuff 




 How is thinking chinese girls are cute racist? And no one asked you to reply to my post

 Good thing I'm lipid soluble 




 "Look is this gonna happen or what?" 









 The last episode just really made me bitter towards Robin. I feel like she was the reason the divorce happened. Sounded like she only cared about her career and never spent time with Barney 




 I asked this too awhile back. General consensus was that was just Barney joking 




 And now you're into human sandwhiches 20 years later?

 I always wanted Ted or Barney (either one really) to marry Wendy the Waitress. She's one of the best looking girls on the show and looks fun. Maybe I just want to marry her :( 




 This may sound weird but I've always thought smoking in old movies or like this picture looked cool. I don't smoke but damn OP's dad just makes it look awesome. Just that relaxed look

 Yes in fact these 2 motions are analogous to said fingerbanging 




 Did anything cool happen or did you just mail them back? 




 I can just hear those ribs cracking 




 Chucks/vansheels. always 




 My cross country team was an absolute joke. We did far worse stuff than wave, like skipping across the finish line. It was fun though 




 Yep, had this happen to me once. The dude came to my car, opened my door, and yelled at me.  To OP, that is a horrible situation and I hope the guy gets thrown in jail for a good long while 




 Chad's bad 




 I definitely agree. Although I did love Archer Vice. Glad it's goin back to the original format tho 




 I thought it went well. They were pretty casual and only asked about 5 or so questions that were all what I'm sure any pre-pharm person would have answers to.  Then they let me ask questions; I had a notebook of them written down so I just asked away. And they were all super nice 




 Did everyone back then just have thick black hair with perfect hairlines? 




 MC Escher that's actuallly a genius title for this. I'm still confused.. 




 Plus the timeline seems all screwed up. I watched Death Note in like 36 hours and I couldn't believe the plot of the sho was over the span of like 6 years 




 All mine was accurate except math. It went from 73 to like a 63. I was not happy 




 Thanks for the advice everyone. If anyone else has questions about the interview process I could probably answer them after today

 Watch all the cartoons my parents wouldn't let me watch. All those missed Pokemon episodes..

 I'd love to wear a button up and tie on occasion. I feel like I'd look weird though 




 Sorry you have had bad professors. 

I myself am a Senior here at WSU and have mostly taken classes in the Bio/chem departments. I have to say with the exception of my Engl 101 TA every professor I've had has been great. They are all experts in their fields, have been very good with explanations and keeping the class interested, and all their tests have been fair in accordance with the syllabus. Even the difficult classes I wouldn't complain about because they just require more studying.

If you are thinking of coming here, please do.  This is an awesome college with great programs (especially engineering).  Go Cougs! 




 Funny you should mention that. I just failed my first Immunology exam, and I too would agree it's been my hardest class to date 




 Rough wasn't it? Feels great to take that last chemistry class though 




 Could be high school, college, grad school etc. 




 I live where it gets sub freezing for the whole winter. Got one of those 3 in 1 Northface ski jackets and it's one of my best investments. Totally worth it if you plan on using one for years

 There's definitely a group mentalitiy in the workplace. If everyone there is friends with each other and happy then there's less chance they are going to leave.

 You always hear about business owners giving people shit for giving them bad reviews. I don't know what's going on here 




 Not to bust on the show here but after Who Wants to be a Godparent I can't blame him 




 Wow that is a daunting task

You should include a count number for all the scotches Ted and Barney drink

Now that I think about it is Marshal and Lily the only people who don't like scotch?  




 It's always fun when you show up to the date, see she looks nothing like her profile, and instantly know the next 3 hours are going to be awful.

Off Tinder though the girl was actually awesome and we had coffee and sang in the car. Of course, at the end she said she was one month away from actually being 18... 




 Not only that but that's a really famous line. How do you fuck up the order of it 




 Dangus the Mangus 




 Because no one wants to go into the dentists, so you have people who come in already hating you. Then you have a rough schedule to keep between their responsibilities. And people's mouths are gross

 Seriously! In high school I was pretty quiet but people would always ask "are you alright?" Like yeah I'm alright now get out of my business! 




 Last week I finally finished Atlas Shrugged after months of reading it. I'd post my thoughts of it on here but too drunk and too many thoughts of it ha 




 Favorite book from high school.  




 Dude you are on a roll today 




 I like that umbrella part. I've also heard that With Tracy it was already raining, but with Robin Ted had to make it rain 




 That's exactly my point really. He's basing his whole exodus based on a republican be voted in next. Well who knows what the next republican might be like. Maybe he'll change America for the better 




 You do realize there have been more Republican presidents than Democratic ones right?  




 I think 100 million is a little much for this situation. For most people here that'd be over a million per year, and that would already be far more than most of us make. 

But Like other people said set up long term investments 




 That the girl you think is into you is definitely into you 




 Well my one item would have to be the check the lottery people wrote me. Then go back in time say the 40's when I can actually use the check. Of course then my present lottery winnings are worth fortunes more. I then buy the US government, bang the First Lady of the time. Then I'd die fighting in Germany whistling a Charlie Parker tune 




 Math. Which is weird because I can do physics/chem type math but actual math classes I've never been good with. I think it's the lack of application the book's present 




 I've done it a couple times. Met up with this one chick, we smoked and watched a movie. Later we were making out and she wanted to have sex but I didn't go through with it, kindof a weird time for me.

Other time she ended up being like 45 and again I didn't go through with it 




 I just want to work at an independent coffee shop in Seattle and live in a crappy apartment. I'm a senior in college now and think about seriously doing it all the time :/

 Back in 8th grade my friends and I counted down the days til Battlefront 2 came out. Now I've been waiting years 




 The episode that's an entire freakin documentary of Robin Sparkles makes me want to punch somebody.  I mean it was funny at first but I feel like it became more of an inside joke for the actors/writers than to us the audience 




 TIL adenosine=adrenaline from a high school bio student 




 Same here and since Ted says it like 20 times in the episode I figured actually saying bitch each time would be a little ridiculous. I agree though c word makes more sense for reactions 




 I work at walmart and we have chip readers along with the magnetic ones. The chip ones seriously take at least a minute to read (sounds short but not when there's a line). If we're gonna use the chip readers they need to optimize them

 A ball point banana! 




 I wouldn't say Marshal is two dimensional, but sometimes I feel like his personality is all over the place. I feel like they add traits to him for jokes but they don't always make sense for his charaacter 




 Fully agree with the changing thing. They made it sound like their only reason was "we want the kids to look like they're still the same age." Well through some more makeup on them because the Season 9 HIMYM is not Season 2 HIMYM 




 The only food I think of with Wisconsin now is their frozen custard. I wish I could eat that forever 




 How do they get the mail? 




 Grabs spork 




 I felt the same way. I think my biggest complain is they left out not only major characters but the major plot that went with said characters. We miss a lot of the conflict resolution with the film

 So after his face smashes into the steering wheel he thinks hmm that was nothing, guess I'll keep going. Then gets stuck again 




 A paragon!! 




 my 8th grade IMs.. I shudder to think. In high school the girl I always talked to wanted to go back and read them one day but I refused 




 I thought that word died out awhile ago. And I hate people who act like they're making Sperry's cool, as if they haven't been for like 100 years now 




 I've only seen this on the internet and still don't know what it means or how to pronounce it 




 Pumpkin beer is probably my favorite seasonal. The flavor is good but only for a short bit so one month of it is perfect

 This episode has the classic fun fact of Barney previously not knowing how to drive and yet in this episode he has a license. Not only that but what appears to be a rented sports car

Meanwhile Ted is far too nice like always and Stella is a grinch as per usual 




 The episode where Marshal gets dating advise from Barney and fails miserably. They make up at the end though 




 Thank you!!

 Yeahh. Had the show been like 3 seasons it would have been fine because we knew it was just about meeting her. By season 9 though I think us fans wanted to know all about her, not just the shadow. 




 I don't think there could possibly be an answer to this. If you think about it, he would have to be describing everything people are saying and where they are etc. It's sortof the difference between reading a book and then just watching the movie 




 Slap a vest over that crime scene of a tie 




 The douchebags are replaced with crazy people yelling at nothing. One time there was this old dude with his hands raised yelling "THIS! I CREATED ALL THIS!". It was funny though 




 My 3 hour layover in Atlanta was pretty much awful 




 I know right? My family used go on ferry rides from Bremerton just for the views 




 Only club in the Palouse maybe 




 I think it's totally unfair to Halliday what happened to him and I hope he recovers.

But this will be a great oppurtunity. Since this season is more or less over anyways Falk will get some good training in. Then the next 3 years he can continue on building a strong team and Mike Leach can steer him in the right direction 




 Thanksgiving day, in my opinion, is one of the busiest travel days of the year

I just want to punch her 




 Yes, and the stuff she said which everyone claimed to be funny just because she's not they type of girl who would say those things, was just painful to listen to 




 Yeah and that's because he looked like the definition of old school cool

 What's with these?

 I don't know about jail but certain parts of your body would be a little too exposed for the impending plate throwing 




 I love craft beer but there's just those nights when I need me some PBR 




 I don't understand why he had to manipulate votes anyways. He got like no less than 500 points on anything he ever posted plus gold half the time. He said he downvoted info that wasn't correct, but people only paid attention to his posts anyways 




 Same here. They're easy to order, they dont leave you drymouthed like jack and coke, and you look cool 




 This is what always gets me. They're like yeah 1000 will pay my kids school, oh 60? Good thing the casino is right over there 




 I'm a college student who got rid of fb. It's really not that bad, you just have to use email more 




 So that he could once again talk to Tony and get his sweet archaeologist gig 




  If people upvote it, that means it's good content, plain and simple.

The people who upvote are probably the same people who forward emails 




 That may be, but the people commenting =/= the people upvoting. Theres plenty of examples of thousands of upvotes, but the few hundred comments are all negative towards the image. Usually the comment section is people who truly care about the quality of pictures on here 




 They also have soup. 500 50 oz cans of Chicken noodle comin my way 




 Ok wrong word lol. Not something you'll have the rest of your life.  




 You just sit on them and glide around the gym and of course smash into anyone in your path. Of course it ended in one of 2 ways: Your fingers going under the wheel or the thing tipping over also crushing your fingers. 




 Yes, I work at walmart so walking around a lot so when I started working I bought a pair of Nike trainers and they've been amazing. I see my coworkers wearing chuck taylors and can't imagine the horror their feet are going through 




 Seriously. I mean I know everyone has that thing they like to spend their money on but buying coffee however many times a week is an astronomical amount of money on something that's not even tangible 




 Artificial sweetener like Splenda. Probably not the best but look how common it is now 




 I'm not sure what the WUE is but 1) I think if you applied now you would get in and 2) if you wait til December I think that's still plenty of time before the deadline although I don't totally remember

Plus doesn't your application update when your new SAT score comes in? I think it might 




 Keep your eyes out on CL 




 At least 3000. This is the type of thing where you just make a milkshake that's 1000 calories 




 Oh yeah I giggled for like a minute at lacrimal caruncle 




 is it the evidence of abstinence? 




 Initials plus lord helix since I made this when twitch plays pokemon was happening. I guess its just a cultural reference now 




 So should I take tests while hungry as well? 




 Yeah I watched all of Scrubs then someone tried to get me to watch house. House is just a dick minus being funny and I figured every episode was going to be like that. 




 I just think they could have labeled way more things, and way cooler things too 




 That's actually not that bad. Especially in that glass case, looks super nice. Plus all those random things put together some of which aren't exceedingly common. 




 First off this might be long and I don't really expect anyone to read it...

Anyways, first time I read SP was a couple years ago or so and now I'm rereading them for about the 50th time.  And every time I read them I get this "feeling". And I think it's that I sort of relate to Scott in that I tend to elate things in my mind, and I'm also really clueless about girls emotions.  For example, Scott and Kim's relationship how she never stops caring about him. I know I've unintentionally led girls on in the past and I feel like a jerk about it. But by the end of SP we realize that everyone has done things in their past that were bad, or they regret, and it's a nice thought that you can move past that.

I also love the books because I (and I'm sure everyone) goes through the struggles of life (school etc.) and SP sortof has that simple carefree life and it reminds me to just not worry about things as much.

Anyways, those are just a couple reasons why the books are awesome. Maybe other people relate to the books in the same way, but either way thanks for readin 









 Was that a recording of a crappy tv from someones flip phone circa 1996? 




 I've seen girls at my school walkin around in the smallest dresses of all time and heels in the winter on ice 




 I love the hair fwoop even though he doesn't have long hair 




 I know a big thing in their minds seems to be that "you're just not the one" but seriously. Especially when they are already like 35 years old and it seems to me like they have everything except that one spark that it takes.  They do end up going on more date in season 6 (?) and at the end Ted says it's just not going to work. I guess it always just seemed a bit forced that they don't get together 




 I always kindof thought that was off. Doesn't a judge have to be impartial? 




 coh-STANZ-a 




 Hope the cadavers in my anatomy lab appreciate these 




 She also tries to run off to Spain using the money they don't have when Marshal is being an environmental lawyer. Sounds more like something Barney would do 




 He is exactly what you need. No more, no less. 




 The thing about Jar Jar is that I've grown up to hate him. Ewoks are cool though 




 Us plebeians down here can only dream 









 That one girl towards the end just chanting in the dudes face. Such fury 




 That's what I thought it was until the end when everything just went on as is.  Ultimately though I think it was just a way to showcase the actors talents. Either way I thought it was a cool scene 









 Then years later marry the girl who helped him to live 




 I should, totally ruined my night 




 Yeah guess I got ahead of myself there thinkin I was goin for the easy kill 




 It was the best burger in NYC 




 If you're talkin Rogue Squadron there was the AT-ST walker level, the Tatooine race with the T-16, the cadillac, the millenium falcon, naboo starfighter. I love that game 









 Who's Zed? 




 I love Scrubs so much. The difference between JD and Ted is that JD is like hmm I haven't been laid in awhile guess I'll pull the doctor card and pull a hot girl while Ted overthinks everything 




 Technically that would still be 0 
























 Okay, I'm just going to ask this.
Do you really want to come back from this? - 

What's that supposed to mean? - 

Architecture is killing you, Ted, and it's killing us to watch it killing you.
You're like that goat with the washcloth.
You want it so bad, and every time the world tries to take it away from you, you keep grabbing it.
But you know what? It's just a washcloth.
Why do you even want it?

 Because I have to be an architect.
That's That's the plan.

Screw the plan.
I planned on being a famous artist.
Marshall planned on being an environmental lawyer.
Robin planned on being a TV reporter.

Found it 




 I'd say that was only because of Zoe though and her motives, not him not enjoying the building process 




 She basically tells Ted to quit as an architect and just give up on everything he's worked for, saying it's killing him and killing them watching it kill him. She also compared his career to the rag that the goat was eating saying "why do you even want it so badly". To me it just seemed so anti-himym advice.

I don't really like Ted's answer though saying "that's the plan". It's not just the plan to him it's what he loves doing and I wish he had said that instead 




 Ambulence rides are like 6 grand though aren't they? Unless I'm dying of anaphylactic shock I'll just drive myself 




 I guess it could be a little ironic since in one episode Lily tells him it's a made up word 




 Patton is also rated PG from what I remember. I've never heard so many swear words in my life 




 In Mother Russia fedora tips you 




 I think that was the first time, and Barney does it in a later episode as well 




 My possible theory is that it's them pronouncing her name wrong, to me Scherb(o)tsky sounds much more correct and I don't think Robin ever pronounces it with an A sound 




 I have the green hemp shoes and the soles wore through in like 3 months, which is unusual for adidas I don't know what happened but I was sad 




 Trains are crazy. Not to be the physics nerd here but the amount of mass a train has even with little speed it still exerts an insane amount of force 




 I thought it was cool, but I guess it was more cool actually being there 









 I can look more like Kurt Cobain! 




 Kinda looked like that! Also sorry for the terrible quality 




 Preferably the SEM for this situation 









 My friend said it great, in LoTR they made every single orc, the most copy pasteable thing imaginable, to look different and therefore awesome 




 Sorry for the late reply but yeah like the other person said it's just not likely, especially if they were both goth to your point 




 That is very cool. It's also super foggy right now so fitting 




 Been to WI a few times my self, on a scale of amazing to orgasmic how great is frozen custard? 




 You forgot this / 




 Wasn't Lily a goth chick from high school all the way through freshman year of college? Not saying it couldn't happen but to me it seems a bit of a clash, I guess it's for a joke though 




 The booster and the cars with the metal bottoms not that plastic. Gives them way more momentum 




 It's really no wonder Ted is hung up on Robin forever. They live together and Robin basically puts him in a state of perpetual jealousy, or rather they put each other in that state. Sure ex's can be friends but not like that 




 It definitely has some of my fav episodes: sexless inkeeper, playbook, last cigarette, girls vs. suits, etc. I thought it was good as well 




 In WA it's like 9.50 now so very different across states 




 Never done Greyhound but Megabus is definitely the way to go. It was comfier than my plane ride 




 Aint nothing like a Liz Lemon party cuz a Liz Lemon party is mandatory

edit:thanks for the fix it's been awhile 




 The amount of history and lore that came from this is actually amazing. In those few weeks books were written, memes were created, and much time was wasted typing "up" or "down" 




 I played Slime volleyball with my roomate last month ha. I still got it 




 Hans Gruber, international bandit 




 Had you said blinds I would've been freaked out 









 No but his mom is always a special 




 This would be more creepy if he wasn't so loveable  




 We can build one in Tacoma. Oh wait.. 




 Terrorists last word's are "begosh" 









 I believe there's a song about this 




 I thought it was kinda funny. Maybe I'm just missing the show more than I thought though 




 True. I think a big reason I'm making a bigger deal of it is because I've hung out with OG katelin a couple times this semester ( in college) so probably remembering it more than usual 




 It does seem to be pretty common. Thanks 




 That is very true, I think you're right 




 She's my friend's girl's friend and we may all go on this double date thing this Friday. Is it weird that she has the same name? Well I know it's weird but more like is this a deal breaker?
---   

Also I've met like 5 girls with this name in the last year so I've pretty much given up on trying to meet a girl with a different name

TL;DR Thanks guys
 




 The girl I may take out on a date has the same name as my last. Weird? 




 Didn't expect to cry today but umm.. okay. :( 




 Am I doing this right? 




 Not asking this girl out because I was leaving for college like 5 months later. Shoulda gone through with it 




 Marshal is decent looking ( I think? I'm a guy) and a lawyer. Plus funk band

Lily is pretty hot, kindergarten teacher, and hot dog eating champ 




 I find tinsel distracting 




 He also betted Marshal off 




 Is that Spokane, Washington? I always wondered b/c I live by Spokane and it's a big city but didn't really think anyone outside of WA would know about it 




 Well she had very recently moved to NY at that time so yeah guessing they were friends but not yet really good friends yet  




 I'm hardly an expert on this but I believe this is why you will suddenly get the urge to poop. Your internal sphincter will get a signal and relax enough for it to exit 




 And just to mention the external one is voluntary but there's an internal sphincter that is smooth muscle and beyond conscious control 




 I suppose but how about when the majority of people worked in factories, or the Great Depression where people barely even had jobs. Then they worked at least 40 hrs a week and barely got paid for it 




 I always have at least 2 lab tests on Dead Week. Makes it a serious time crunch 




 I keep seeing this on Reddit but really what generation had this luxury? It's pretty much been hard work for America right from the beginning 









 Well apparently OPs other repost 5 hrs ago wasn't successful enough so he brought out the big reposting guns 




 If you're thinking about Owen I like using there computers alot more than Holland Terrell. the seats are way comfier and they are always open 




 Local bounty hunter. Doin the King's dirty work 




 Started selling Kirby vacuums. I did quit only like 2 weeks in b/c I knowingly went in to it thinking it was a scam but it still was a bad experience 




 Immunology. Not only is the material very expansive and detailed, the professor is also insanely hard. The tests are 100 points except for the final which is 200 and they are very tricky mult. choice and lots of in-depth application short answer questions. It's a very interesting class but damn it's difficult 




 Usually really happy/fun but occasionally mellow/down. Sort of depends on what I was thinking about that day 




 My biggest complaint was that it had the worst search function of all time 




 That's the worst part. Slutty graphic tee's for junior high schoolers 




 I know when Ted was in Barney's dressing room Lily comes in asking for Ted that Robin needs him. I can't remember if she said best man or not though 




 You would have to say Thank you for browsing random 




 The depression under your nose is known as the Philtrum 




 Where do the hoes go?? 




 How bout when people out of state drive on our roads? Do they then have to pay? 




 Sort of like the Styx concert
 




 And Spike learns you can't fix everything by kicking it 




 The year I owned a Ruckus was the best of my life. I owned those open roads. 30 mph at a time 




 My day always starts off with 3 eggs in a breakfast burrito with Pepper jack. Best breakfast ever 




 I'll have to see. Usually nurses and the like love me because my veins pop out a lot 




 That would be an impressive resume if she could actually do all those things 




 Same here! Although last time I donated I got really faint and my arm hurt for days. It also took a really long time, like I saw people come and go in the time I donated. I should try again though.  




 I tried it last Halloween. I don't really like sugary drinks but it definitely tasted like a tootsie roll 




 That's just ResNet (happened in Stephenson). With deadweek here I'm sure you can expect more of it in the next 2 weeks 




 Sports games + Finals 




 The style reminds me of a TF2 character 




 Except what's in those what appear to be locked drawers at the bottom? 




 I've noticed in my travels that if you are anything more East than like Chicago people will assume D.C., but for us Seattelites most people around here assume the state 




 Like Pepperoni only sexy 




 Hey, Reel Big Fish and Streetlight Manifesto will always be on my ipod 




 I feel like skinny jeans will always be a thing. At least for me I have pretty skinny legs so they are just better fitting 




 Who told you to put the balm on? 




 I just chug water before going to bed. Works every time 




 Boot up the computer and ask /r/askreddit what to do 




 Live in Seattle and work in a pharmacy. Either in a hospital there or at a retail place 




 For one turn off your phone, even one text can get your mind distracted for minutes. Also (IMO) studying can be a lot like working out. It's hard to focus at home with so many distractions and going to the library to study is the equivalent of going to a gym 




 Best of Van Halen. Panama is such a kick ass song 




 Don't feel bad about driving slow, especially down hills. It is much more manageable even if you start to slide 




 In WA it's half that.. but I'm sure it's quite different in NY 




 And why did I continue to watch it till the end? 




  It's just too much money for what you get

Definitely this.  I walk everywhere nowadays and these kinds of shoes just don't hold up anymore. I still buy them though.. Good insoles are important though 




 Ochem lab. Most people did not take the "slowly pour" instructions seriously with conc. H2SO4 and the vials basically erupted when people poured the stuff in. One person got serious burns on their arm 




 There are a lot of houses on Greek row that could potentially be awesome if they weren't so run down 




 /r/beertrade 




 the other half is in Iceland. According to pics anyways... 




 Brings back the horrible memories of after-school care in the lunch room for me 




 Hot water plus a cold beer and some alone time. At least for me 




 I love how you drew the fracture in with it. Good anatomy! 




 I don't know who you are but that's blasphemy 




 I've pretty much always hated Lily. But yeah the worst part is the writers acting like her actions are justified. She always does terrible things and at the end of the episode they try to spin it on some way that makes it alright. And yet, hardly anything she does is right. 




 blues Brothers will always be my favorite movie. It's hilarious, its got blues music throughout, and more talented actors then you can shake a stick at 




 And why does Irfanview not have 1366x768 as a default picture resize option? Or Gimp2 as well.. 
























 This is one of my favorite episodes. Everything Marshal does at the party is amazing 




 Well Robin still seems to hang out with Barney when he's teaching Randy how to live. I doubt Lily ever really hangs out with Barney and Marshal is usually with Lily

I do feel that Ted would be more mad with Robin though, not just shrugging it off 




 This honestly sounds worse than anything the kids would be doing 




 Used to work at a McWalmart. Would not recommend  




 Maybe the flag glasses are deceiving  




 The Seattle native in me has to say that there is much more things that are "worthwhile" to do in Seattle than those, not that those aren't fun either 




 Lost it by the gas station by Stephenson.  It's a gray vans wallet. I posted on CL too but if anyone finds it I'll give them a reward.  Thanks   Go Cougs 




 This has one of my favorite quotes from Barney

"Was the Blair Witch easy to deal with or did she haggle over the closing cost" 




 I've had some life changing epiphanies in there 




 And you're an anti-dentite! 




 ITT: Wegmans 




 My guess is oxidized piss 




 That *is* a tasty burger

 I love how they attempt to get back into formation while also fleeing for their lives
 




 ehh they were probably gonna die anyways 




 It is fun, by senior year though it all starts to sound the same. If you're a freshman though go and enjoy it! 




 Why does everyone hate this episode so much? I think it's far from the worst

the part that always bothers me is Lily's terrible gun handling skills 




 Lately it seems the "cool" thing to do is like the ending regardless of original opinions of it 




 I loved the finale and have never heard the whole dead theory, then again I'm 22 so wasn't really aware when the show was airing. I really like this explanation though 




 Well there goes the next 48 hours of my life 




 That chicken is oddly proportioned 




 Good, I get paid in potato 




 It amazes me how many people here (in WA) think that just because its legal doesn't mean employers won't test for it and turn people down 




 S2 E10, James wears that same tie.  




 This is what the infinite staircase felt like we^just^need^the^music

 Do I get a vote? Skank lane! Skank lane! 




 This makes me sad too because I think he's a great actor. he just got caught up in Pirates far too long 




 People would always dare others to do this and I'm like 'I'd do this anyways'  




 HIMYM and 30 Rock I thought both had great hooks from the start 














 If you've never read the book this is a great one to read, even if you don't like reading. This whole operation was pretty crazy and the book tells it from a lot of perspectives, including some stories of Somalians

 If i had my phone in my right pocket and wallet in left pocket that sounds really uncomfortable. Is it better than  I'm picturing it? 




 Figure out how you study best. I came in Freshman year thinking it would be enough to look over the study guide a couple times and be solid. Did NOT work out. You'll score a lot higher if you know how to study well

Also study a little bit every day instead of cramming, if you do this you'll have all the time in the world to go out and have fun 




 The funniest slaps are when they're not anticipated IMO. After Slapsgiving they all? have an episode solely based around it 




 I think it's hard to say given that it was only season 1 and their plans for how the show would go were a bit different then. It is an interesting point though since he seemed pretty fixated on something that would not bode well for Ted and Victoria's relationship 




 There's that episode in S9 where they say you can have that one "you can't ask me why" request. But in Season 2 Marshal asks Lily a favor when she returns to NY but she can't ask why 




 Star Wars Battlefront. I've probably spent a couple hundred hours on Bespin Platforms alone 




 Whenever I chew gum it's as if I've completely forgotten how chewing works 




 I think most trending subreddits are from askreddit threads. It's always funny to see a post there and then the next day the subreddit its trending
 




 I'd say he's one of the very few people who actually pull off autotuning, I love 808s 




 I mostly agree with this. I'd also just say that any good music today isn't the catchy type of song that you would hear being sung in a bar 









 He didn't have a coke 




 My OChem professor used the chalkboard. OChem 2 used powerpoint and I hated it 




 Let's not forget John Belushi either. The Breakfast of Champions skit is hilarious and probably not even close to his funniest performance 




 I agree that they rushed their relationship a lot. they dated for like 5 episodes? It didn't really help that the next episode was The Playbook, where Barney actually uses their breakup to his advantage. I didn't really like this episode either though it was painful watching Barney and Robin being total jerks to each other 




 I'd say one reason is because a large portion of both guys and girls here work out consistantly 




 Ahhhh.... ohhhh.... 




 Holy fuck. The wing actually scraped the top of it. I can't imagine how loud and terrifying that must have been 




 Constantly rubbing my fingers together. I just can't stop for some reason

 Tim's Jalepeno chips are perfect 




 Wyoming. I think they ranch there?  




 I guess we're bday buds 




 The entirety of E. WA is 1.3 mil though so King Country alone has more than the whole other side of the state. This isn't an argument for money but more for voting and the fact that E vs. W has different needs 




 Easily one of the best episodes, not only because the acting is great but every character is engaged.  Ted wearing Tweed and becoming the sexless inkeeper and Barney's hilarious poem. Then Marshal with the gouda and Jason Segel's great singing video montage (meow). Then Barney and Robin being a "single" couple. "Just the 2 of you?" Lily getting upset with Marshal for springing the video and then getting in trouble for inviting the other couple for a weekend away too soon. And finally Ted'd own poem and Barney's look of regret at the end for being in a relationship " What have I done!" 




 I just hated her reason for wanting to save the Arcadian. She grew up in it? I get the sentimentality but the fact that the snake infested building could be replaced with something way better that affects everybody would've been much greater.

Yes I know the lion stone headwork is iconic!! 




 This and the time it takes to gather the courage to go ask. I used to sit the for 15 minutes debating whether to go talk to them or not. Now it's like 2 beers and a couple minutes 









 3 months ago was a good time for this repost 




 Fine I'll take on that role tonight 




 Cheap tricks?! Not one of these is a cheap trick.
Except for "The Cheap Trick.

And even that one involves expensive hair extensions! 




 I laugh everytime at this. To me this is truly clever humor 




 You're right I had it on best 




 This is the top comment, though. 




 Black, purple, and teal were the official colors of the 90s. Just go look at the sweaters in thrift stores 




 4th grade powerpoints were allll about these. Of course putting a picture in the clear text was the best 




 That's what really confused me. They end up breaking up and instead of going to Barney who she claimed to have feelings for just goes back to Ted 




 I mean it's hard not to feel that way. We can only really take Ted's word that he loved the mother but we never really see it. I mean yes for a few episodes but not compared to the years we've seen of Robin 




 I used to always think Barney, but over the years I've changed my mind to Marshal. His speeches, singing, he's an actually good person but will still do stupid/funny things. He's an all around character 




 2 gen chem labs in a week *shudders* 

If you do decide to do that I'd advise not taking another class along with it that'd be too much 




 "Who the hell is that guy?"

"That's Shin-Ya, he's sortof been auditing the class" 




 How bout Modern Marvels? Also great. Or when they actually played Rome and WWII documentaries all the time

 Not sure what the hate on Stephenson is about. I had lots of fun there. There's tons of people so you will find someone that has similar interests, it's no more than a 10 min walk anywhere, it's got tutoring in the building if you want that, and if you want to party you'll have no trouble finding one 




 I always thought that according to Marshal's he didn't wait nearly enough time to go out with Barney after Lily left him 




 I thought this episode was good too, the classic himym retelling of the same story. Also, there are just faaar worse ones than this all throughout season 9 




 Was the name of the dorm Stephenson..? 




 Beanie girl is looking longingly into his eyes 




 I almost forgot about the Balloon Robin thing. almost... 




 Not only that but any microbe on the babies skin the mom probably already has antibodies specific for it 




 Freshman year we actually managed to throw a decent party in someone's corner room (bigger than most dorms). All of a sudden an RA came in and there was alcohol everywhere. One dude there decided to go into the bathroom and punch the paper towel dispenser so hard he ended up busting up his hands and the police were called. Then this girl ended up puking on the floor of the corner room and the RA had her escorted to the hospital. It was basically chaos for a bit. I managed to walk out and despite them getting our student IDs down only the person who punched the dispenser got in trouble.  




 Mini putt. I've been playing it for like 10 years now never gets boring 




 That picture does not look to scale at all unless that fountain is going to be huge 




 I'd say the porn one was realistic in an edgy sorta way. The cliff one and bday one were a bit funny. Everything else made no sense 




 I've only really seen him in 30 rock and I love him in it. He does sound a bit crazy in real life but I can deal with it 




 Loan words? 




 I don't know what that is but sounds awesome 









 Probably because he sounds like a 14 year old 




 I couldn't even finish that. When she says "how can you sing about this with little kids listening to it. Don't you have kids?" Like Fuck it's up to the parents to not let their kids listen to that, he doesn't want little kids listening to his music it's not his audience 
























 The uncyclopedia? What is this some sort of bing knockoff? 




 This goes for guys and girls *especially* on a first date: Do not be on your phone! 




 I love this episode, Barney's part is hilarious. "More marinara sauce!"

Really though, was Lily actually about to hop on a plane to Spain? Without Marshal and no money or plan for being there? This just gets glossed over but I bet if Marshal had found out about that it would've been a whole different story 




 Are you saying that first part is a good or bad thing? Because I think S6 was overall a little too serious 




 Good lord, this is the type of website we were encouraged to make in my 6th grade web design class. So awesome and horrible 




 The round mouse that they used? I hated those things

 First saw her in the hallway of my gen Bio class and thought she was cute. A month later she was at my apt because she ended up bein a friend of a friend. Skip ahead like 5 months and I invited her to  a party I was having out of the blue and she came. We dated for 8 months after that 




 On home for spring break atm and m'mom made shrimp stir fry. So tasty 




 Skateboarding has the coolest physics 




 Pretty much. At McDonalds I got a burn from the fish steamer that was on my wrist for years later. Plus all the hot oil jumping off the grill constantly. Usually not a big deal though

 Whatever that Greek place is in South Seattle, they make the best fries I've ever tasted 




 I'm from seattle area! If you like weird stuff check out Ye Olde curiosity shop in Seattle, it's right along the water. You're also within walking distance of pretty much the whole city, at least as far as touristy stuff goes. If you want to go hiking, the Cascade mountain range is about 40 minutes from Seattle so not too far 




 Like the other person said it depends on how much you'll be making. That is not too much debt though tbh 




 Watch this sub be trending tomorrow 




 You'd be surprised. At night when all those places close down there are crazy people everywhere, and it's usually when all the tourist/business people are trying to leave 




 The times I've been up to Seattle I swear it turns into a whole different place the minute it turns dark out. There's some crazy people there, and like you said this is right by the main bus stop 




 He's trying to forget the constant hunger 




 NPH once again kills it with the acting at the end. He conveys that feeling of regret so well I can feel it everytime 




 Hopefully with proper spelling

 It's a desert with nothing there besides Spokane 




 Someone want to explain this to a noob like me? 




 Thanks for your time. I'll be goin to the doctor soon 




 I don't think she was perfect I just think she was one of the few characters on the show that was a legitimately good person.  And she was finally a girl that Barney wanted to respect and someone he could live up to. Barney should have been allowed to get a girl like that 




 Yesterday my friend pointed out they look a bit yellow, and looking in the mirror they are definitely not quite white. I know that's a sign of jaundice but it just seems very unlikely. I'm a 22 college student, and yes I drink but I'd say an average amount. Any help? 




 *glass shattering* 




 I just think it should be removed all together. I don't llike any laugh tracks though 




 It still adds to cost though, and that's just one small example 




 How about we just stop spending money on things we really don't need at the moment. Looking at you oldbookieturnedstudentcenter

 How about Tab cola? 




 I mean Barney Hooked up with Katy Perry and Brittany Spears so I don't know about that. I agree though Ted and Zoe is my least favorite. Just makes zero sense 




 That's what I'm sayin. Dark at 4:30 is seriously depressing. And who cares if it is dark in the morning 




 Often times you don't get very high your first time because the receptors in your brain aren't as activated as they could be. And you are more prepared the second time 




 Fair enough. I'd personally recommend trying it more than once but no big deal 




 Well good on you for being a responsible parent 









 Corpuscle 




 Now there's a jump in comedy 




 Absolutely. I feel like you are focused on one aspect here. This is a massive show and they did a great job constantly tying ideas/jokes in with each other. Some of their subtle references to other parts of the show are genius. And yeah they had their inconsistencies but nothing that ruined the show 




 Crocodile Dundee 3 totally holds up 




 Are we still talking about people? 




 The problem is it's really hard to keep a consistent pace for more than a bit sometimes. Things get tired and you have to move around a bit if you want to keep going 




 Ok that is pretty similar. Then again, there are tons of songs that sound similar to other songs

 That makes no sense though. he attempted to move that stuff around to a better spot and they threatened to fire him? He probably got fired for taking his phone out at work

 It's not. And instead of the last 10 of these pics being posted in the OG thread karma whores have to make their own post so everyone can suffer 




 Star Wars Battlefront, the game I've played hundreds of hours. I remember in 8th grade my friends and I counted down the days for the 2nd one to come out. Of course, it's all about Bespin Platforms and the sand dunes level. Then space battles on the second one

 I live in a college town, 2 summers ago there was an entire block of houses on greek row that opened up their lawns to one big party. There was easily over 500 people there, the street was totally filled with people, the houses were crowded and beer pong in the lawns. I could hear it all the way from downtown which is like a mile away 




 I kinda think this is really dumb. For one he's 20 years older, he's wearing a hat and sunglasses, and they wouldn't be expecting him to just be there

 I'm fine with the location, dorms can walk there easily etc. I don't like the proposed uses though, either. It should be turned into something we don't already have, we have more than enough gym space. I seriously doubt this would alleviate much from the rec, they would just both be incredibly crowded 




 As your lawyer I have to advise you stop all further comments 




 Without being quantitative here I seriously think they drink every day to some degree or another, sometimes starting at about 8am. It's hard to tell what days they actually are in the bar since there's no definitive time line in the episodes. Some episodes span over weeks while others are days. Or in the case of season 9, about 10 minutes lol 




 I'm just waiting for the day someone either comes into my house at night or there's like a classroom hostage situation. Haven't decided on if I want to be the big guy on the news or humbly walk away from the situation yet though 




 The trick is to just stay on the edge 




 OP had the Breaking Bad filter on 




 KenM is a genius 




 [Sup bro](http://imgur.com/jJpJok1) 




 Considering everyone is getting the same degree/striving to the same goal I don't see how that matters at all. But based on your grades I think you can kindof guess how you are doing compared to others 




 I love this episode. Jorge Garcia playing the Blitz was hilarious like when he yells out the numbers from Lost. I also like this episode because they travel around alot. Seeing them in the bar and Ted's apartment gets kindof old after awhile but them driving around was pretty funny.  And seeing Barney's cardboard oven "I should probably disconnect the gas then" 




 -19 karma and gilded 3 times? That's gotta be some sort of record 




 What was worse is we had already heard all his songs 100 times. THEN they hit the radio, made it like 1000 times 




 dat double filet o fish is where it's at 




 Probably because they are far more expensive than other sports cars. Last time I checked a Mustang is like 20k less. And many people in their 20s seem to drive WRXs and used BMW's 




 I know some people who were offered lower management positions because they had degrees, one of which wasn't even in business or anything. I don't think getting a full time job will be too difficult for you because they need those people here, not just students who can work weekends 




 And the first time Lily is in his apartment he notices her by looking at the wall? Seems like it's implied that there is a mirror there or something reflective 




 Mentally. Getting an A in anatomy. It's the only A in a science class in college I've gotten and it took serious time 




 I think not at all. For one, even with all the knowledge at my fingertips I hardly look it up. In fact I'm sitting in a library right now with enough books to easily become a heart and brain surgeon but I'm not reading them because I'm not motivated to on my own. School has structure, and teaches you how to learn things, and you can interact with others. And if you've ever taken an online class you know they're just not as enjoyable as the classroom setting 




 I used to think this was the most boring show of all time. So wrong, I can't describe it the show is just amazing 




 I wonder if that's on his resume 




 I have terrible posture when I walk but when I actually remember to walk up straight I feel manlier 




 Seriously. Does the word porn mean something else? Maybe, but in this day in age especially on the internet it ultimately means one thing, and that's porn 




 Was just watching this episode and it's pretty extreme how Ted pulls this off, really to the point where Robin wants to date him less than she already did.  Not just renting the blue instrumented band but it also looks like there's about $100 worth of roses in the room. I guess looking back it just seems like Ted really was desperate for her 




 I believe its S2E4 Ted mosby-Architect.  Robin says one watch through was more than enough for that movie 




 Not nearly as awful as "Well, it the bug room, Ted.
Your ass just got bugged." 




 Or when Robin did the flip on Stella's daughter's bike trying to get back to the news station 




 Or when they sit on the table, and ask why when you tell them to get off. How bout 0 respect and that table costs more than your life 




 If I win I will flood /r/randomactsofpizza with pizza 









 I loved Robin all the up til about season 8. It started with her yelling at Patrice which I just found really annoying. Then in Season 9 when she was fighting with her mother in law the day before the wedding was not funny it was just painful.  Finally she just continued to be independent to the point where she only cared for herself 
























 What is going on with that dude's Adam's apple?

 My friend this NYE wore a vest with a button down shirt under it with a fedora. At first I thought it was ridiculous but he actually pulled it off well. Maybe it was his lack of a neckbeard, or any beard for that matter 









 I know it's already been said but this was freakin awesome! You did an amazing job editing that with the video and sounds and the order of it. I'm crying right now 




 Yeah pretty much. Also "having" a baby with your friend is a bad idea

 They wasted the place tagging it is what they did. If they could keep this up it's like the ultimate club house for you and your friends 




 Wish I had known the point before I first pressed it. Just another 59 :( 




 I think I got 60?
 




 I pressed it without even thinking. Guess I'm just a sucker for peer pressure 




 "Plot twist: How I Met Your Father is about woman #31." from a comment there. This would actually be awesome. It could allow for a whole different dynamic, any type of show really. They could film it now so they have the final scene (since NPH would be aging throughout it) and it'd be just like HIMYM 




 Don't worry.. ducky tie comes back. It finds a way 




 The first time I watched it that day I enjoyed it. Then I watched it again an hour later with my girlfriend and didn't like it. The more I thought about it the more I didn't like it. I have to say I haven't watched any episode from Season 9 since, I've rewatched the rest of it plenty though 




 I'm sure at least 10. The problem is I'll watch a random one in like Season 5 then have to start at the beginning and watch all of them 




 This means I have to pay rent today :( and no gold to pay with

 Sites like twitter and yelp must be the best and worst thing for companies. I can't imagine getting your whole business destroyed by social media. Not that they didn't necessarily deserve it 




 It's also based on other things I've heard of the show. If you want to make a case for it though go ahead, I'd give a second chance 




 I know what you mean. All of a sudden plates are bowls and pieces of bread are plates 




 I actually forgot about Guardians but yeah that was a great movie. And I'm sure plenty of people on Reddit are big superhero fans but I think the masses will lose interest when there's lesser known superhero movies and too many sequels of existing ones 




 I've seen only about 1 episode of Friends but from what I remember it was nothing but half-attempted sex jokes. It did not seem funny at all 




 Yes. Although I suspect after Avengers 2 we're going to see the decline. I'm sure they were popular but I don't know too many people who watched the sequels to Capt. America, Thor, Spiderman, etc. 




 The difference is other out of state students probably are not paying out of their own pocket. I think everyone here would love for you to come to WSU but 100k out of undergrad would lead to a lifetime of debts and would not be worth it. WSU is fun but I'm sure the schools in Florida would be good too 




 Agreed. that is way more than a 40 lb difference. And looking like the left to the right in 4 months would be insane

 Did some research. OP seems to post stuff in fantasy and writing subreddits. He's also the mod of r/shadestaff however it seems like a week old.  Looking up on Amazon the book came out about 6 months ago. Don't really have an opinion but these are the facts

Edit: I agree though that user has got to be an alt

 I think every character had a good plot in this episode. I also really enjoyed Barney and Robins dance. It pretty much makes no sense but showing off their talent makes up for it. 

That scene at the beginning though with Ted and Marshal outside on the bench though. I kept waiting for that in Season 9 and it never happened, I didn't expect the same dialog but something to show it at least 




 every school ever 




 You can definitely tell there are far more viewers here than there are commenters. I almost feel bad because I reply to most the threads here but it would be nice to hear more people's opinions on things. Like other people said though there's less and less new ideas to be discussed 




 I always thought Marshal and Barney change the most. Seeing Marshal in Season 1 he looks like he's in college still, and Barneys face gets more defined wrinkles by the end. Robin and Ted hardly change at all IMO, and Lily "has statutory written all over her" 




 I had that exact car in high school. Super fun car to drive with the manual transmission and its turn radius is amazing 




 Wow, that's actually really subtle. Nice observation

 The person I know who's color blind goes out of his way every possible time to mention he's color blind. In class there will be a diagram with things labeled and different colors and every time he says "fuck you I"m colorblind!"

 I really liked this episode the first time, but the replayability is low. They kinda beat the theme of it to death. Having to rewatch the same clips like 10 times over gets annoying especially when you already know what's going to happen. I guess it's a nice recap of the show though

 After Robin says they should go see Woody Allen Barney says "Why would I do that? I'll see him at poker on Tuesday."


Later Ted is explaining why Barney needs a win and Barney says "And firing half my department freed up the money to double my own salary.
And this chick from Boston was wicked hot in bed last night, and I'm getting more muscular, even though I've stopped working out, and I've got this amazing poker group."

 This is one of my favorite episodes, mostly because of Puzzles. That whole story arc is funny. And Marshal telling the story while getting interrupted is good too 




 Yeahh thebutton is fun but there's like 10 subreddits for it now it's a little excessive  




 Ahh yes. So proud of my school for this one 




 I just saw it go all the way down to 12 s so who knows 




 The closest one on the right it has a very interesting nose 




 Cool! Any info on the planes in this pic? 




 Those could have valuable in store credit value! 




 This episode makes me think it would have been awesome if there would have been 1 episode for the other characters to tell the story instead of Ted, give us a little more insight to their personal thoughts. Especially Barney and Lily, they would be interesting.

So was this a platonic act done by Ted at the end? 




 No. Also they said they would serve anyone that came into their shop they just would not cater a same-sex marriage. I'd say that is a perfectly reasonable thing to do. I can't believe how many people are up in arms against this 




 Red is more underused than some of these, seriously brown? I'd say teal, mint, orange would have been better advice  
























 So in the store you will notice TV's playing stupid commercials about products they carry. These have been around for awhile, but recently they installed newer monitors that have what appear to be webcams at the top of the screen. I'm assuming they're for facial recognition software, but I just though I'd let you all become aware of this latest installation.  




 Took 3.5 years to buy a decent camera 




 My last girlfriend said she got gifted multiple games on Steam from random guys she's never met. I really don't see the point as the guy 




 I'd say the best advice is to look at the pre-reqs you need on your own and make your own schedule. That way you can just show it to your advisor and they can change it as needed 




 Right? I love the book The Outsiders and they're smoking at the age of 9. Let's bring those cigarettes back 




 Almost forgot which subreddit I was in for a second 




 But he spent millions on it and he has computer coders living in it in pimped out Airstreams. Not you know, white trash 




 West Coaster here, was very confused by the logo. Still confused by the different names 




 I've never seen a cat jump like that, then it gets flung back like a ragdoll   




 When and why did they stop making things awesome looking? 




 Robin wouldn't have gotten so jealous, Ted probably would have obsessively gone after Robin, Ted and Robin probably  would not have gotten together 




 NPR is the one page on FB that I actually enjoy in my newsfeed 




 Myspace was fun because nobodies parents were on it 




 I remember last time this gif was posted I think to /funny. Everyone was up in arms about how badly the dude got hurt, I never realized redditors were that anti-prank. The dude didn't need to chase after him at all 




 That first one is pretty funny. Just last night I was watching one of the first ones where Ted and Robin are dating and she calls him Teddy bear even though she hates nicknames 




 Assuming their eyes work similar to humans that's an incredibly accurate shot considering the effects of the water 




 And I think it's the 2nd episode ever when he says he was hooking up with a girl in his back seat 




 There's other cans that say "wingman" 




 Yeah, just don't make fun of people for things that are out of their control 




 That final goodbye... 




 This is why we need a redditor to point out another redditor's username 




 Where do I sign up for these? 




 A few more bounces and he'll be getting 1 ups 




 I had Mario Party calluses on my thumbs 




 They also make fantastic salsa 




 I know this was supposed to be epic or whatever, but I was just confused. The Boyz 2 men part at the end was so out of left field and random I couldn't appreciate it at all. It really just made no sense, along with the rest of the episode 




 Soo like how ELI5 is actually supposed to be? 




 At least you can only vote once unless... well you know 









 I'm still friends and roommates from the people on my floor there. I had a blast there, it's kinda loud but you can work around it. Just keep your door open and you will meet tons of people. Also it's close to the science buildings, don't know if that helps you or not 




 That will be a difficult schedule since you will be spending a lot of time in anatomy open lab. If it's only in the fall though and you need it, then you got it 




 Bosco 




 I hate the Robin/Loretta plot. Them being mean to each other a day before the wedding is honestly not fun to watch at all 




 She's hot but Marshal could easily get any girl he wanted 




 Well she was hardly honest with Marshal about the whole SF thing before she left for it, she never mentioned it to him 




 They can't see me if I can't see them 




 This was a good start to the season. Of course, well, nevermind.. 




 And then someone replies with the obligatory other girl subreddit with the super long acronym name 




 he's saying independently he is going to date who he wants to, but if she doesn't like his friends then that is a problem to him 




 This episode was 11/10. So perfect. I didn't like a lot of the episodes from this season so when this one happened I watched over and over. It's definitely different from the normal settup but it just shows how deep the show can get. Just Ted alone with his thoughts and I think we've all been there, and the speech of course. One of the best out of the whole series 




 There's also a time when in like the 2nd episode Barney says he hooked up with a girl in his car even though he doesn't own a car nor can he drive 









 Or we just make short acceptable to wear as a society? I don't see what's wrong with just khaki shorts that aren't cargo short or anything like that 




 If you had just deleted everything after the comma it would've been good 




 I'm not saying it tastes bad but when you have commercials on TV I think you're no longer a craft beer 




 This was really just a strange episode. I like the Robin Sparkles videos but to have a whole fake documentary on a character was kindof pushing it big time. It's awesome they got all those cameos but it also felt like a bit of a waste of their talent to say one line. Just more weird attributes to Robin's character

Also why would they ruin the whole Marshal Lily story like that? For the sole reason of justifying what Ted is doing by being a stalker? Had they seriously ran out of that many ideas at that point? Seemed totally unnecessary to make Ted feel better 




 Had to look it up and learned he's 31 years old. Did not expect that 




 I don't know boxing but I keep hearing Manny is past his prime, but Floyd is older than him. So what makes one more out of their prime than the other? 




 If these are clean is there an NSFW version? 




 *raises spork* 




 Definitely scales especially with bass guitar. Learn scales, then chords, and chord progressions. 

And do practice consistently but don't burn yourself out on it, just be patient 




 Ha the comments "this is turning into Digg" and "this is looking more like metafilter"

Complaining about Reddit's downfall was there from the start 




 Definitely grades. And Finals schedule 




 A game of world domination played by two guys who can barely control their own lives 




 This has been brought up recently on here but seriously why did Barney propose on Ted's big architecture night? Yes he wants Ted's blessing but it didn't need to happen then. Plus Marshal and Lily barely showed up. I think that really piled on for Ted, the fact that his friend's got engaged and no one even showed up for him. Poor chap 




 He just said studying in the tub. The other 85 minutes are spent soaking 




 You've been on a roll the last couple days, glad to see you active on here 




 Pretty sure that guy was joking. At least I hope he was 




 We should get an AMA from one of the players at this game 




 I have no doubts there are more men than women on online dating, although there are a lot of women. But comparing it to the real world is fairly similar, there's almost always more guys than girls at every party/bar you go to.  Just gotta do what you can 




 This episode was actually pretty funny with all their different stories in Barney's apartment. I love at the end when Patrice asks what Lily and Ted are doing there and Barney says he doesn't know his friends are just intrusive lol. The ending made me want to vomit though 




 It was also one of the first. There was WoW but Runescape was free. The other popular game at the time was Neopets, and I guess club penguins if you were into that 




 If UW is so damn great then they can apply and go to Seattle. If being in their hometown is their priority then they shouldn't be going to Med school 




 Also the guy that makes one word follow up posts for tons of karma?  




 My roommate does this, I have to leave the room everytime he eats anything 




 They're real, and they're spectacular  




 Really quite heart-warming. They're mutual teamwork almost makes up for the whole target chinese and arab markets thing 




 Seriously why is dogfish head so much more expensive? My local bar will have all pints $2 except theirs 




 How else will the most people get the most karma? 




 Look up the standup slide distance record. People slide on their knees like 50 feet because they're going so fast 




 I mean he was actually successful until he decided to just cut into the guy 




 How do they not clean up anything before they leave? The spilled food stuff everywhere is really gross 




 Just like anything it just takes some "practice" and getting used to.  Next time you're out try talking to a stranger about anything, ask them how their day is going. People are surprisingly nice. Or make it easier on yourself and go to the bar, order a beer and talk to the person next to you. Then work your way up from there, and don't be afraid to speak your mind 




 Those blood oranges. If you ever have the opportunity to try Elysian superfuzz beer it is quite good 




 Will Arnett is the perfect "business man" looking man 




 Qdoba now has free guac and sour cream. $1.25 is just ridiculous for some guacomole when I can buy a whole one for 60 cents 




 It says Delta Tau Delta on one of the doors

Don't know where I got this but I've had it forever 




 Correct me if I'm wrong but those aren't the voice actors, it says they are the inspirations for the character's looks? 




 My ex loved dirty talk, and I was terrible at it. And she would want me to talk dirty as I was doing stuff to her so I guess like narrating what I was doing at the time? To me it was just weird I guess 




 Where did he even keep that when he wasn't using it? Do people actually carry these all over? 




 Pretty douche move by Brad, which is too bad because I always thought he was funny throughout the show even though we don't see much of him. 

There must be like, 5 episodes where we see that Ted is apparently the only reason Marshal and Lily are together. And everytime it's used as some justifiable thing for something he does wrong, like with the birthday picture plot earlier in the show with Lily 




 So why are turtles riding alligators exactly? 




 I'd say twitter and gplus are fb's nemeses  




 Dat ass. She's got a shelf on her back

 I love the dinosaur utopia that's between the layers 




 Back when it was just simple and easy looking. Had the categories and way easier to find everything, especially random stuff 




 What doesn't make sense is when Barney calls out to the taxi cab driver that his gf is a stripper. He is yelling at stairs. 




 That is some impressive paw strenth 




 I am also 22. Does that mean I get to date her? 




 Would that even be illegal? Tons of bars and restaurants have the same name throughout different cities 




 Welcome to Sports Center 




 For instance the wheel, calculus, logic, etc. 









 Everyone in here debating rotational forces and I'm too stupid to realize the picture is sideways 




 A wise choice my friend 




 Why would they not make Ted the godfather instantly? Lily and Marshal would never ever choose Barney to be a godfather, seriously. And then of course they all 3 are at the end, just like they were co-best men.  I know it's just a show but when it's this completely unrealistic with the gameshow and cheesy music it just makes it kinda cringeworthy 




 My shins were covered, and now they're not! 




 Ahh. Carry on then. I like your beaches by the way 




 And Washington is right up there in vegetable and fruit production, so why take resources from us? 




 Not even a verified email. Now that is self control 




 His brakes must not be working properly 




 I slept with the groom

 That's faster than I run a 5k in.. 









 What about the beard guy at the bottom left?? 




 I took an uber on NYE in Seattle. Took like 20 minutes total to get to Capital Hill and cost like $10 if that, and the driver was awesome. Great service 




 What a terrible episode. Everyone is just a douchebag for no reason. And why on earth would Klaus be living with Ted, why would any of them want that? And Lily and Marshal just get written out because baby 




 So it's like the lottery whether I'll die or not 




 I gave my cat a bath today. From the sounds he was makin you'd think I was throwing him down a slide too 




 Seriously was that real like what the fuck?! I can't stop laughing though 




 For that price I'd never leave the room I'd just watch fish all day
