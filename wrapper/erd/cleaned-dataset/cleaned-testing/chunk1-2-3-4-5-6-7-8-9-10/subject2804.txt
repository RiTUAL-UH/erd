 Nothing will keep multipools from mining profitable coins 




 Yup that's a thing 




 They already did at the 1.6 fork/update. It's called digishield and the digibyte guys helped with it. 

The reason multipools are still mining doge is because of the profitability.  




 Sounds like a plan 




 Um hmm 




 I'm a little disappointed. I asked another shibe to post him on his 'roo and he didn't. Now you post without your 'roo. I'm starting to think all my geometry classes and books were wrong about the land down Under

 You need encouragement? Did you put a little too much money into dogecoin than you could afford? 

Dogecoin has been around since December (as have I) and so much has been accomplished! The water wells, Jamaican bobsled team, save them hood, Nascar. The community is always positive and has grown to almost the size of btc. For dogecoin to go away it would mean that no one mines anymore and there are no more merchants to accept it and no longer has volume on exchanges. I don't see that happening anytime

 At first it was hard work. The stressful days and long long hours into the nights. Many times I thought of quitting and going back to my 9-5 desk job and begging my boss for mercy and maybe a raise so I could family. 

But then I meet this beautiful woman who seemed to have a plan. 

She started out by telling me her 3 step process. 1) Find an investor. You need a money backer to get supplies. 2) Find a good location to do business. 3) 50. It was about that time I realized she was a 50 ft tall towering creature from the mesopotamic Era asking for money! I said "get out of here you god damn loch Ness monster! "

 The crust is a prepared dough from Pillsbury. 

The sauce:

5 dried pasilla or ancho chiles, stemmed and seeded

Two 6-inch corn tortillas, or handful regular tortilla chips

2 tablespoons olive oil

1 1/2 medium onions, chopped

Kosher salt

2 cloves garlic, minced

2 tablespoons smooth peanut butter

1 teaspoon dried oregano

1 3/4 cups chicken stock

One 3.1-ounce disk Mexican chocolate, chopped, such as Ibarra or Abuelita 

Freshly ground black pepper

Other ingredients:

1 1/2 cups cooked chicken. I prefer chicken legs

Cilantro

Queso fresco

Crema fresca

Sesame seeds (optional)

To make the sauce, blend all sauce ingredients until smooth consistency. 

Precook the dough for a crispier texture and better mouth feel. Otherwise you will get raw dough. Top with sauce and chicken and bake until dough is fully cooked. After it's done, top with queso, cilantro, crema fresca, and sesame seeds.  









 Or by handling it, then eating something else without washing my hands? 









 Spicy honey. Perfect for chicken strips or shrimp Tacos 









 For Flan:

* 12 oz Carnation evaporated milk

* 14 oz Borden sweetened condensed milk

* 4 eggs

* 3 oz [Cajeta quemada](http://www.amazon.com/Coronado-Cajeta-Quemada-13-Oz/dp/B0000GIOPW) syrup made from goat's milk

* Baking spray with flour

* 2 tablespoons vanilla extract

For cake:

* Betty crocker or your favorite brand of Fudge Chocolate or Dark Chocolate cake mix.

Preheat oven to 350F and spray the cake pan with the baking spray. Add cajeta to bottom of bundt pan so it settles before adding cake mix and set aside.

Mix cake mix as instructed on the box. Set aside.

To make the flan add evaporated milk, eggs, and vanilla to the blender and add condensed milk last because it is so thick. Blend until well mixed. 

Pour chocolate cake mix into pan. Pour flan mixture over chocolate cake mix **slowly**. It will settle as it cooks. 

Bake 45-60 minutes until knife inserted comes out clean.

 Pb j sandwich. I'm allergic to peanuts 




 Pogs. 

In elementary all the cool rich kids had them. I was a poor immigrants son with no allowance. Our family was dirt poor. I'm talking hand-me-downs between the girls and boys. So naturally seeing all these kids playing this cool game at any chance they could really angered me because I couldn't even buy one. I decided to sneak a few away from some classmates thinking they wouldn't notice. The teacher caught me red handed. She called my parents for a conference so she could hand out my punishment. My parents asked what the consequences are and my teacher said "I need about tree fiddy"  it was about that time I noticed that wasn't my teacher but a 50 ft tall creature from the paleolithic Era. I said "get out of here you god dammed loch Ness monster"
