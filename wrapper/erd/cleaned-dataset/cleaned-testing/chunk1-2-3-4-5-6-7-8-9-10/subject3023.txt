 As well, once you get a bit of gunpowder, you can duplicate it via Alchemic Chemistry with blood, or hand in the repeatable quest "Covered in Ash" 




 Yup. ME^3 's gonna win. GG, m8. 




 Running Red is about being dead. 




 And really, m8? Parcel gets a flair, and I don't?

I see how it is .

 Why is your name VikeStep? 




 It's all good! \o/ 




 m8, not trying to be rude or anything. Your explanation was very good, I was just pointing out some stuff you missed. No need to yell at me 




 I also think the story deserves some focus, as much of it revolves around it. The player is dead, and has to cope with being dead. It takes place between life and whatever happens after. Very light and cheery, right? 














 :O
There's a mods section on the MC wiki? :OOOOOOOOO

 \o/ Amazing!
Suggestion: I don't know if you've done this, but you are able to disable Mystcraft Instability per-age. There's an in-game command to do it. 




 First, put a Fluid Transition Plane next to the lava to soak up the liquids, like Cypher said.
Then, if you want, you can have the AE network output a certain signal when it's grabbed enough Lava. Have it output to the Master Ritual Stone, and bam! It will only consume a certain amount of lava before turning the ritual off. 









 You're amazing at everything, it appears :P 




 Yes, I'll get that out in a few updates. It has the compass texture because I can't texture :P
I've gotten permission to use other textures in an upcoming update, so don't worry! :D 




 Yeah I waited until I had a Igneus Extruder going to make Compressed Cobblestone for my farm 




 I'm doing Blood Magic/Botania, probs Mekanism/Thermal Expansion. Also the big "everything centered around Blood Magic" one, AKA Running Red. 









 Personally, I prefer to play Demoman.

This video shows off the new gamemode I created. All it is is a simple config file that the server downloads, and executes, allowing for anyone connected to play in a Zombie Apocalypse, without any download required by the client.

From "About.txt":
"The game is a four player co-op match where you attempt to complete the original objective of the map. In Upward, you push the cart, in Process, you capture the 3 control points, in King, you try to capture the control point and survive for 3 minutes. Unfortunately, in Apocalypse Rising, the players are hindered by zombies. These zombies spawn in groups of 6, every 20 seconds. Not only that, but each player only has one life per match, adding to the overall difficulty. [There are 3 maps that have support included in this, Upward, Kong King, and Process, all of which represent a different difficulty. Included in the readme file are instructions for adding compatibility to new maps.]

Apocalypse Rising was created in order to give clients a fun, easy way to play TF2 as a zombie game. The policy I had when making this was that I wanted there to be absolutely no download on the client's end, and that policy has held up until the end.

I'll take a moment here to say that Apocalypse Rising is completely open source, just read the configs to see what's happening, and feel free to change or add stuff to it.. Maybe I'll even make a video on that."

Thank you for looking at this. -Gideon Seymour 
























 Immediately after the announcement, I tried to feel sad that I didn't win. And I tried. But I couldn't feel sad. There was no reason to (aside from the lack of communication between the hosts and participants). I would have made Running Red anyway, I'd had the idea for a while, but this competition just gave me a reason not to procrastinate. It wasn't about winning. It was about making a good pack. And I feel I have done that. I've made a pack that sends a message, and is unique, which is something that rarely happens these days. I've accomplished my goal, and gone far above it. Running Red got listed, which is something I've only dreamed of. @PurpleMentat , who has always been one of my favorite Youtubers, did a series on my pack. Plus, I tied what is currently the most popular modpack. I consider that to be a huge achievement. I'm happy to have been part of this competition. It wasn't about winning. It was about sending a message. And you know what, I accomplished my goal.

Thank you for all that you've done, and congratulations to Parcel. 




 It (once I finish the story) will have a great impact if you choose to kill the cows and chickens. 




 I'll look into that

 The biggest similarity is that is uses HQM.

Amazing. 




 I had this dream that the results were leaked to Panda and then we grilled him for information. He didn't say anything, and then the results were released.

You won, because you had a Mini-Me of Slowpoke101. Slowpoke said in the dream post that there was no other reason.

It was the worst nightmare ever. 




 You wish. 




 It's LOL. Apparantly it originated on 4chan. I blame ThatOneSlowking for it.

 I like parties. 




 You need slabs on all the sides, and then you can water them with a Watering Can to speed up the growth drastically. 




 I make Running Red. I just want to be First ^ ^ 
























 Not too late to add it.... ;) 




 Running Red spatial cell coming right up 









 You could try Running Red 2: Vampire money [here](http://forum.feed-the-beast.com/threads/1-7-10-beta-running-red-2-vampire-money-chapter-one-hardcore-magic-rpg.51957/). It's a hardcore pack based around combat. And other fun stuff. 




 :3 




 It appears so. I'm working on a fix 




 Running Red?

#shamelessplug 




 And yeah. If you didn't see what trajing said, the release is now available on the launcher 









 What version of BM are you using? 




 Here, I'll give a few more, as people haven't found these:

* Energy Cube from Mekanism (Mechanized)
* Die 64 times (We're Not Working Out)
* Something involving Milk. I can't remember what, exactly (Running White)

 Despite the fact that you told me this was your account several times on IRC. 




 Bloody hell, RealSketch.

You have some sources for that conclusion? 




 I use Unity by CyanideX, as even things that aren't textured yet blend in well with the theme 




 There's one being developed here:
http://forum.feed-the-beast.com/threads/1-7-10-hqm-hardcore-the-butterflutter-0-0-1.51296/ 




 The pull request is being merged, which does several things, but the most important being the move from the BC API to the RF API 









 And adding in the Lifesteal effect. Normal Golden apples will not be craftable, and Ghasts won't drop tears*. The only non-violent way to get health regen is via Notch Apples.

*Air Sigils 'n all the things that use the tears as components will have altered recipes. 




 If you can get it 




 It's a custom potion effect designed by Strikingwolf that gives health regeneration when you damage things, AKA drinking their blood. You get the effect thanks to Lore Expansion, which awards you the effect when you get the appropriate piece of lore, AKA your level of vampirism 









 Pretty much. 
























 Aha. I see what you did there. 




 And in EnderIO you can upgrade your machines with new Capacitors as you go. You can also upgrade your armour and conduits. 




 Not sure what he's looking for in a point. Unless you've got a quest book, Minecraft is a game where you do whatever you want. It's sandbox for a reason. If he truly wanted a point, he could use HQM or play another game.

And it's not like TiC has more of a point than EIO.

What could have happened:
 someone (~chatzilla@2001:558:6025:b:61a6:66e3:ae28:196a) has joined #TinkersConstruct

"I've made a Pickaxe. What am I supposed to make next?"

"Tell me there's something to make next. I will be severely disappointed if there isn't."

"I'm looking for progression or something to do other than 'hurr move dirt and stone around'"

"I'm looking for a goal or task that the mod wants me to perform."

"The mod has content with absolutely no direction or purpose on its own?"

It's a sandbox game. It's not meant to have a goal. 




 I always ask this :P

 For the armour, it only blocks 90% of damage now, if you have the required blood. However, using Soul Harden, you can get it back to 100%.
But it was buffed at the same time. Now it has more protection against Piercing and other negative effects like Wither.

 This is my base on a slightly modified PhoenixCraft II. I think it's pretty good, but I need some help figuring out what to do. I give descriptions and stuff on the album's page. I'm usually not one for aesthetic builds, so this is a little new to me.

 Sweet! 




 Everyone's favorite Blood Magic Dev [WayofTime](https://www.youtube.com/user/WayofFlowingTime) has been playing Bevo's Tech Pack for 1.7.10. 




 It's filling the internal buffer. If anyone were to use "I'm Looking at Blood" (an addon for WAILA), or take out the Vanilla Sigil of Sight, they'd see that it is filling the internal buffer. 

The Internal Buffer itself holds 10% of the Altar's max capacity, so for a non-upgraded Blood Altar, it would drain about 1000 blood. Subsequent upgrades (E.X. Runes of Augmented Capacity) will increase that, and Runes of Dislocation will increase the speed at which it fills/empties. 




 This guy explained it well:

 I know how to use Lockdown, m8. But until the feature is added that allows for one to specify the spawn dimension, you can use PerfectSpawn to specify it.

As of right now, Lockdown and PerfectSpawn do different things, as Lockdown generates the same world, and PerfectSpawn specifies an exact spot for people to spawn at. 




 You can use PerfectSpawn for that 




 ...Blood Magic 




 Adding to this.

For even more guidance on mods that aren't in Monster, [Material Energy^3](http://forum.feed-the-beast.com/threads/1-6-4-material-energy-3-jampacked-hqm-ctm-beta.48913/) appears to be popular, as well as [Running Red](http://forum.feed-the-beast.com/threads/1-6-4-running-red-v1-1-4-jam-packed-hardcore-magic-rpg-good-as-crash-landing.47464/) (#Shamelessplug).

Running Red is focused around telling a story (and a fun mod called [Blood Magic](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1290532-1-7-10-2-1-6-4-blood-magic-v1-2-0-updated-oct-13)), and may have a theme a little too dark for some people. It tied with Crash Landing in second for the Jam-Packed competition, which makes it just as popular. Right? .

ME^3 is focused around conquering dungeons in an amazing CTM style experience, having you collect trophies, complete quests, and complete the Periodic Table. It's a very fun and popular experience. It won first place in Jam-Packed, and I really recommend checking it out. 




 I was about to ask why there wasn't a "No" answer. Then I realised. 




 inb4 you crash into another planet 




 Deadly World 




 Well, this is vanilla. But if you happen to head underground, and see a cobble version... Silverfish nest! \o/ 




 I'm testing a new release right now. It's *mostly* bugfixes, as it's been hard to add new content while working on three packs. Recently I've been requested to update PhoenixCraft II, and as well, I need to get that one update out for Running Red.

Once I finish all those, I'll start on adding new content. I have some things in mind.... ;) 




 I imagine like with Crash Landing, where they'll have points taken off

When I finally got all of Meat Boy (basically RNG, even if you had Book of Revelations, because the Meat Boy/Bandage Girl thing.). It unlocked the three (Platinum God, Real Platinum God, and Meat Boy) at once. So there ya go.

 I stopped learning when I was able to play in class with the Vita 




 * Devil/Angel Rooms never spawn on the First Floor, however,
* The Goat Head ("He Accepts Your Offering") will force a Devil/Angel Room to spawn, no matter the floor
* Not taking damage on the floor increases the chance of a Devil/Angel Room spawning
* The Evil/Sin stat increases the chance of Devil Rooms
* The Faith stat increases the chance of Angel Rooms
* Making a deal with the Devil greatly lowers the chance of an Angel Room spawning, and will increase the chance of Devil Rooms 




 All you can do is praise to RNGesus it doesn't happen again 




 You can reach the Cathedral or Sheol after the Mom's Heart fight by getting a Devil or Angel room on that floor. Otherwise, you'll be forced into the chest.

However, after you've beaten Mom 10 times, whenever you go back down there again, you'll face off against It Lives!!! rather than Mom's Heart. After killing It Lives!!!, you'll be given the option to go to either the Cathedral or Sheol, every time you get that far. 




 I miss the textures. 




  **"Chub dislikes smoke!"**

This is a reference to how, when a bomb is placed while Chub is charging, he'll consume it and it'll explode within him. This is also a reference to Legend of Zelda, as a similar boss disliked smoke and was killed in the same manner (credit to /u/Aksh0le )

 **"Rooms may yield more than you expect - Experimentation is key"**
 **"A dark market lies under your feet"**

These refer to what's beneath the carpets Zelda-esque sleeping rooms and some rocks, as these trapdoors can sometimes lead to the Black Market rooms.

 **"The walls will harden over time - Time is the essence"**

This refers to how the Boss Rush Room only appears in the wall if you beat Mom in less than 20 minutes, else the wall will "harden" and you won't be able to access it.

 **"A piece of paper is your guide"**

This hints at the Missing Poster and the Mysterious Paper, which, when you die in a Sacrifice Room, will give you a piece of the puzzle to unlocking The Lost.

 **"Deny his gifts to attain your reward"**

This refers to how you have to forgo the offerings of the Devil Room in order for Angel Rooms to appear later.

 **"Sleeping gatekeepers will need to be awoken with a loud sound"**

This refers to how one must blow up the Angels in the Angel Rooms in order to fight them to attain the Key Pieces. I feel as though the Devils don't blow up like the Angels because Satan doesn't want you to fight him, as there's still a small chance he'll lose. Every offering he gives, although some make you stronger, also potentially make you weaker for the final battle against him.

 **"Some doors require a blessing - Carry them with you"**

This refers to how the Key Pieces, the blessings from the Angel Room, are needed to open the doors to the Mega-Satan boss. 














 I think it would be amazing to have someone write reviews on modpacks, mods, and does interviews, and whatnot. That's all we would need to make ModMyMC a full news outlet.

Several people (including yours truly .) have expressed interest in doing something like that. It wouldn't be restricted to just Feed the Beast, but could include AT Launcher, and Technic, and those doing interviews could speak with people prominent in the modding community. I personally would love to see something like this, but I don't  know if anyone else is. 
























 Yeah, we just brought on a whole bunch more people. We should get through the updates much more quickly. 









 You could try [Phoenix Reborn](http://forum.feed-the-beast.com/threads/1-7-10-phoenix-reborn-tech-magic-progression-ores.59301/). It's got quite a bit of tweaking, and has all the mods you mentioned. Plus, it's got a whole bunch of progression instituted and whatnot. 




 Well, due to how progression works in Phoenix Reborn, ProjectE isn't accessible 'till late game, and can't be automated until even later. So, at the beginning of the game, I had a huge farm in order to supply me with plenty of toast. I had several machines that I used in various stages, and most of them are still back at the original base where power gen is. I only transferred the frequently used ones to the new dimension.

And I figured that I might as well make it compact, once I started making the void dimension. From there it was pretty simple. 




 http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/2229562-rftools-dimension-builder-teleportation-powerful 




 Yes, it's amazing. I've looked at the Shield System as well, and it's a great low processing power cost alternative to MFFS. Plus, it's really easy to build the shield as well. 




 That's either Apple Core or Spice of Life. It indicates the amount of time left in that Hunger Point. I believe you can disable it in the configs. 









 Don't worry, you're not a bad person. It's my fault for making the code a little to obvious :P 




 Heh, I'll make sure to fix that.

 Running Red, Wanderlust, and Tolkiencraft II. 




 If you look through this AMA, you'll see that even slowpoke himself agreed that Ultimate, although generally looked upon as well balanced, actually had quite a few balance issues, mainly via cross-mod compatibility.

I find the tools much more of a upside than a downside - without them, something like Running Red or Crash Landing would never have been possible. And bloat, well, I think FTB is trying to avoid that now. You saw how Monster turned out. FTB is now trying to make well balanced and enjoyable packs, between Mage Quest, the soon to be released inFlux, and Resurrection, we have very many specific packs. Sure, there is a lot of them. But it's not like Monster or the Adventure Update - everything isn't being crammed into one. Each pack caters to specific audiences. No single pack is too large, and no single pack is too big to be considered to have content bloat. 

The tools are helping pack creators fulfill there vision for the packs. Without them, I would never have been able to tell a story, Jaded wouldn't have been able to build the paradise in the sky, Eyamaz wouldn't have been able to create hell on Earth, Iskandar wouldn't have been able to create a faraway planet, Orator would never have been able to bring to life the works of JRR Tolkien, parcel would never have been able to make compressed cookies, Elec would never have been able to create the skylands, Lumaceon would never have been able to make a Crafting Paradise, and Yulife would never have been able to reload our Wanderlust. These tools are what give are packs life. They're what make our packs unique and not just another kitchen sink pack, which is all we had before this. We're not creating bloat - we're creating something new. Something unique.

I'm sure we'd all be glad to play the same packs, over and over again, just for a different version of mods, or a different version of Minecraft. But I find it more enjoyable to play something new. To be cast into a world without water, or one filled with evil creatures, or in a station, with disks of the world in my hand, or in a medieval landscape, or in a home in the sky. None of this would have been possible without these tools. None of the small tweakings that go into making each pack work. We can make our packs better, and take our time to give you good content, or, would you prefer it if we gave you a kitchen sink pack with cross-mod compatibility issues? Sure, one may take time. But each time we take our time, we create something new. Whether it's a mainstream pack built around Gregtech and memories of the past, or a jarring landing on a distant planet, we're reinventing modpacks.

Noone's trying to replace Ultimate. Ultimate has been done. We're trying to create something new. If you want Ultimate, it's still there for you to play it. We making things that haven't been made before. Just look at the Third Party Modpacks section on the FTB Forums. Would you prefer that each pack is another kitchen-sink pack with different mods, or would you prefer to see stuff in there like Crash Landing, ME^3, Wanderlust, Tolkiencraft, Running Red, PhoenixCraft, Blast Off!, Infinitech, FluxGalaxy, ImpactFlux, Clouds of Darkness, and the Dark Trilogy? These tools have given us the power to create packs like this. No one pack has content bloat- they all have their own visions and tweaks and quests that make up what each pack is. We don't throw mods together and change IDs anymore, like we did with Ultimate. We take those mods and change them, make them fit in the world in which we are creating. We can do so much more than we used to, thanks to these tools. Would you call that a caveat, or a bonus? I'd call it a bonus. 




 The reason it takes more time than it used to is because there are so many more tools available to pack creators. It's not so much throwing mods together and fixing ID Conflicts anymore - now we have the ability to change recipes, create quests, change ore gen, biomes, and so much more. So yeah, it takes more time than it used to, but as well, there's so much more being put into it. 




 Not certain why, but it's in the changelog for the latest build: http://minecraft.curseforge.com/mc-mods/59968-special-mobs/files/2216952 




 All you need to do to fix this is update Special Mobs. 




 Well, try the second. It's nothing like the first. 









 For the world generators, EBXL was only included because of the ability to enable and disable the biomes and villages in those biomes. I'm trying to avoid adding any mods that add content like that, just things that can be used as bases for packs. 




 Alright, I added those. 




 Probably the original for ultimate. The panes are arranged in the same format
http://i.imgur.com/50Q0IgS.jpg 




 Because it takes a while to make these things. 














 What is the average airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow? 




 It's technically not made for multiplayer, but in the recent updates, I've been trying to add more support for it.

I've made quests repeatable so those on non-hardcore worlds and servers can reclaim their effects after death, and I've also added a multiplayer only object that allows for others to revive you. Possibly more in the future.

Anyway, I would be interested to see if there are any servers as well. 





























 If all is working properly, you should be able to breed Mushroom Spores from Pam's using AgriCraft. I'm also going to add a Blood Altar recipe for them, as it is a little difficult 




 Explosions. 




 Explosions. 




 And I'll add here - the last time they made a pack and took mod suggestions (Monster), it was largely considered one of the worst packs they made. I don't speak at all for the FTB Team here, but I don't want that to happen again. It's better they stick to what they know best than try to build something off of any suggestion they are given. 




 It's a kitchen sink pack. They said they were making it because they didn't have one for 1.7, so here it is. Not only that, but look at the list. It has a bunch of great new mods, like AgriCraft, RFTools, Draconic Evolution, and more. They're catering to the most popular mods found in their most popular packs. It's a pack made for what seemed like the community wanted. 




 First of all - What?!?

Second of all, in order to make them "the same," you'll need to add them to each other's ore dictionary. You can obtain the oredict information by doing "/mt hand" whilst holding the item.

Then, just place in, say, if I wanted to add an vMC apple to a copper ore dictionary, "ingotCopper.add(minecraft:apple);"

ingotCopper being the oredict entry. If you add each crystal to every crystal's ore dictionary, they can each be used in every recipe requiring the others.

Now only one question remains: Why would anyone ever do this? 




 What pack? As well, do you have logs? 




 You could use Mob Properties to make anything spawning in the overworld have an insanely high attack 




 As for making the overworld unlivable, you could enforce a void in only the overworld using Ex Nihilo or YUNoMakeGoodMap. You could also just enable "All the World is Superfun" in TiC and that would pretty much eliminate any need to leave the Nether. 




 "This paste has been removed!" 




 Resurrection is being updated very soon, [as stated by tfox](http://forum.feed-the-beast.com/threads/ftb-resurrection-1-0-1-update-info.60834/) 




 The config is very distinctly sorted based on the section of the mod. It is divided into sections based on the part of the mod, so it's easy to see what is part of the Dimension Building system or the Shield System. There are very clear headers :P 




 I don't believe the results were released publicly anywhere, but I would be interested in seeing them. 




 It adds the features with the express purpose of making them RF-Based. McJty's not adding Magic Wands, he's adding a device that you need to power to create dimensions. If you want a magic-based Dimension Building system, you've got MystCraft. Sure, RFTools has Dimension Building, but it's in a completely different sense than MystCraft. Complaining that it has the Dimension Builder it is like complaining that EnderIO adds item transport with its conduits when ThaumCraft adds item transport with its Golems. 




 You can't restrict a mod based on what is, at best, a general and vague description. It says it adds RF based tools. That does not restrict it to a power monitor. Adding additional utilities does not have to restrict a mod to a simple block. I would call a shield or teleportation system a nice utility, as there (AFAIK) is no other RF-based mod that adds such customizable RF-based teleportation. As for the shields, there's only one or two mods (if you count both MFFSs) that do something similar, and both are either high-CPU intensive or not very well maintained. It adds a nice, customizable, and low cost alternative. Yes, Dimension Building is stretching it's definition as a utility, but it's nothing that Extra Utilities hasn't done before. And besides, there's only one other mod that adds dimension building in a similar sense (MystCraft), and that lacks frequent updates and many customization features. Honestly, it's just adding utilities that are lacking in much of Modded MineCraft.

Plus, if you don't want any of the "bloat" in the mod, why are you complaining? There are very simple config options to turn everything off.
Or what if I just wanted the dimension options for a magic-base pack, and didn't want to deal with RF dependencies?

Not sure why you'd be adding something called RFTools to a magic-based pack, but all you have to do is disable everything and set the power requirements for the dimension-related devices to zero. Not that difficult, if you'd look at the easy to understand config file.
How about simple forestry tree farms without the insane amount of extra world-gen?

If a couple ores and bees is considered insane, I'm not surprised you're attacking a dimension building mod.

RFTools is a nice example of a mod that creates nice tools and features while still retaining a large amount of customizability. It innovates and creates new ideas, while at the same time building on already created ideas and making them more compact, customizable, and lag free. I'm really amazed at all the work Mcjty has done on the mod, and I'm even more excited for the things he's planning on adding in the future, such as the Modular Screens.

I could understand if you were attacking such a mod if it had no config options to turn it off, but it does. Many mod authors add in things because it's very likely that, unless their mods are used in a kitchen sink pack, many of the other mods that do the same things are not in the same environment as their mods. Many devs code with only their mods in mind, not any others. And if they aren't, well, they've got config options. You can turn off Forestry's "insane" world gen, or Bluepower's logic system, or RFTool's various systems with a simple change of true to false. 




 Reposting because the original was deleted, and this is big. 









 I'm shaking with excitement right now. We're partnering with FTB. 




 It's basically done. As of right now, we're just updating mods, fixing bugs, and adding EMC to things. It should be perfectly alright to start a world. Most of the bugs that were in the pack have been ironed out at this point, so it's pretty stable. 




 Late game is sort of arbitrary. It varies depending on the modpack or the mods you are playing with. In some packs, late game might be killing the Ender Dragon or being able to combat Taint or killing those Botania bosses. It might be creating a Tier Six Altar and summoning a Demon Village, or it might be having the ability to create your own worlds.

[Phoenix Reborn](http://forum.feed-the-beast.com/threads/1-7-10-phoenix-reborn-tech-magic-progression-ores.59301/) implements a sense of progression and the tiers of the game by sort of restricting things behind dimensions and such. For instance, you could consider the overworld early game. In the overworld, only Coal, Iron, Lapis, and Redstone spawn (although in exaggerated amounts). You'll be forced to use certain mods in order to progress, such as Blood Magic and Botania, until you reach the Erebus. You'll then have access to metals such as Copper, Tin, Aluminium, Lead, Gold, and Silver, which will grant you access to a lot of the early tech mods, which in turn will allow you to create a Nether portal, and give you access to Diamond, Sulfur, Saltpeter, Emerald, Ruby, and Sapphire. This lets you access some of the later game mods, such as a few things from ProjectE or late game Thermal Expansion. Once you've obtained Platinum from the Deep Dark, you'll be able to create the Energy Condenser and automate the creation of items via EMC, and once you've created your own dimensions using RFTools, you'll be able to create things like Energy Collectors and AntiMatter Relays with Dimensional Shards.

Although it's certainly not as grind-like as GregTech, it does have a set type of Progression. Each dimension basically represents it's own part of the game, whether it's early game in the Overworld, mid-game in the Erebus and Nether, or late game in the RFTools Dimensions and the Overworld. Everything is basically set into tiers based on the dimension you're in, and it does take some time to get from one to the next. 




 I tried it without Factorization if Forge 1277, and it did not work. Adding the latest Factorization, it did. Looking at the changelogs, this does not appear to be implemented in any Forge version, but it sure should. It worked brilliantly for the few things I tested it on. 




 I can confirm - this works. 




 Now *this* is amazing. I'm adding Factorization to my instance just to make sure this works. 




 Here's what we currently do: http://forum.feed-the-beast.com/threads/team-member-positions.59861/#post-876355

Unfortunatly, we don't really have time to chech each pack, due to the sheer amount of packs being updated every day. Even with out now huge team, we're having trouble keeping up.

However much we'd like to do robots, we're not really at that point yet.   We're limited by the forum technology and the money we have available. Hopefully in the future we'll be able to do something similar. 




 We're trying our hardest. Sometimes things just go wrong. We get hundreds of pack submissions, there's bound to be plenty of errors. 





























 Well hey, I like it. 




 I'm not sure the exact amount it gets lowered, but yes. That's basically it. 




 no 









 My point being it isn't like every other pack. Your deluxe triple cheeseburger won't end up being worth 1/16 of a shank. It will always retain the same hunger.

If you don't see the point of the change, I could make it impact hunger again :-) 




 I will point out that SoL only impacts saturation, not the hunger value. 




 I made the modpack with these mechanics in mind, just so you know. Everything is balanced around it. I used these rather than other things because, well, every other pack focuses on the same things. Hunger, tool progression, etc. I wanted to make the pack unique rather than using the formula for increased difficulty that everyone is used to.

I knew going into it people wouldn't like it. I'm not going to stop you from doing it, and I'm actually honoured that you care about the pack enough to even bother making these changes. 




 I'll refer to my previous posts for everyone complaining about the inventory:

Hey, look at the recipes for the Energy Condenser or Transmutation Tablet. 




 Uh... I hope you realise I had nothing to do with this.

 If you've used the dimlets given on the ship, and followed the grammar mentioned in the Quest Book/Dimension Manual, your world should have been normal. 




 The repeater. Project Red has an upgraded version of the vanilla one. 




 Yes. 




 DW20 is technically FTB. We make the pack off of his mod list, and make config changes accordingly. We basically make the pack for him to play, hence why it shows up in the main tab.

And thanks, I'm hoping to have fun here :D 




 Basically, Eya and I sort of swapped positions. I used to be specifically Third Party Packs (Running Red, etc), and Eyamaz would work on the official packs, such as Monster and Horizons, as well as his personal packs.

Now that's swapped. I help out with the official FTB packs, such as Mage Quest or Infinity, and he does his Third Party stuff, such as BnB.

The "Modpack Developer" position, at this point in time, means that the person controls the pack development. I'll do most of the config changes, such as configuring ore generation or changing recipes. As well, as Watchful said, I also control the various teams that help with modpacks. In the future, I'll be working with tfox to assemble modpacks and make them what they are, via config changes and the like.

For example, the past few updates for non-infinity modpacks (Lite, Mage Quest, and DW20) have been overseen by me. I sent the Maintenance team the packs, and they went through and updated the mods. I also got the new quests from the Lit. Team for Mage Quest, and then made the config changes DW20 requested for his pack.

TL;DR, Eyamaz has resigned, and I do what he did and make FTB Packs now. 




 Yeah, I've got that on my schedule. It's rather far down, though. I'm currently making Slowpoke some coffee and getting tfox the code to hack into the Curiosity Rover.

Normally I'd be opposed to hacking into a NASA device, but hey. We can't deny our supreme overlords anything, can we? 




 You need to use Servos with TD pipes to have them constantly extract. 




  If it includes an interesting challenge of using an actual backpack for extra inventory I'll be sold. I always liked the idea that better storage had with backpacks and putting them down/ picking them back up.

That's almost exactly what we had planned. We don't want the inventory management to hinder the game, we just want the player to think a little harder about what they are carrying around with them. The player will be able to carry around bags and such.

One of my favorite parts of Don't Starve was that you couldn't just carry everything around with you. It was entertaining to have to deal with only having the essentials on me, with everything else stored in a chest elsewhere. It provided an interesting dynamic that seemed to be lacking in Minecraft, no matter which mods you used.

Item and inventory management are things that are rarely emphasised upon in all of minecraft. Storing things in chests and sorting them becomes completely obsolete the instant an AE system is made. Inventories cease to be a problem the instant a golden bag of holding is obtained. I wanted, at least in one pack, to bring out something that most people rarely think twice about.

I figure that there's always something that will put people off of packs like this. A lot of people hated Blood 'N Bones for its tool progression, Crash Landing for its need of food, or Material Energy^4 for the insane amount of mobs. I know that whatever I change, at least one person will be unhappy with it. A lot of people didn't like the Blood Altar in Running Red (to which I responded: Why are you even playing? O.o), and quite a few didn't like the odd progression in Phoenix Reborn.

With each pack I make, I've tried to do something new. I suppose for Pathfinder, the limited inventory during the early game will be it. If everyone in general comes to the consensus that they don't like it, I'm more than happy to remove it. But as I've said - it's something that makes the pack unique and different. I hope that it will be well-liked, but if it's not, I could remove it. But until then, it will be staying. 









 RFTools based. Galacticraft is not even installed. 




 There will be 




 Carpenter's Blocks. Put the liquid near them, and set

B:"Routable Fluids"=true

This was actually enabled in the original Running Red, and was why it sometimes looked as if the blood was flowing past the blocks.
 









 It glosses over a few of the things in the Dimension Building, but you can learn most of that just by reading the book and playing around with it a little. It's an amazing mod that is very easy to get into 
























 k 




 Oh wow, I haven't played with that mod in so long, I completely forgot that you could get it from sources other than ore xD 




 Well, since things like the furnace result in you getting the same EMC out that you got in (ex cobblestone goes in with an EMC of one, comes out as stone with an EMC of one), I'd make them relatively the same as the beginning ones.

* Manasteel: 256
* Mana Pearl: 1024
* Mana Diamond: 8192
* Elementium (which iirc is two manasteel - one elementium): 512
* Terrasteel: 9472
* The gaia drop thingy name: 1024
* Gaia Spirit Ingot: 13568 




 * Marble: 1
* Limestone: 1
* Andesite: 1
* Diorite: 1
* Granite: 1
* Prismarine: 1
* Basalt: 1
* Teslatite: 32
* Nikolite (does this still exist?): 32
* Copper: 128
* Tin: 128
* Aluminium: 128
* Zinc: 128
* Certus Quartz: 256
* Osmium: 1024
* Ferrous (Nickel): 1024
* Lead: 1024
* Silver: 1024
* Charged Certus Quartz: 2048
* Tungsten: 8192
* Shiny (Platinum): 8192

Manasteel, Elementium, and Terrasteel shouldn't have an EMC value, as I'd imagine it's something /u/vazkii would be against 




 The point of the mod-of-the-month pack is to build a pack around one specific mod. If you're expecting another kitchen sink, you're in for a shock :P 




 I'm pretty sure it'd be hard to base a pack around Decocraft haha :P 




 I'm perfectly cool with it - I try to help people understand configs and scripts and such. All of the Phoenix Team packs have their configs available on github for anyone to use them, just for the purpose of helping people learn. So long as they aren't copying an entire pack, I'd be happy to let people use my configs as their own. 




 :) 









 No idea what happened there, but you appear to have spawned above the bedrock of the Erebus. Kind of like how you can get above the bedrock in the Nether. I recommend just going into creative and breaking some of the bedrock so you can get down there. 




 We actually have a person dedicated to changelogs - that'd be /u/VikeStep. Normally we get the packs to him earlier, but he's a little busy with education things right now, so the changelogs will be a little late. 









 Neat 




 The old one should work fine with the new system 









 http://paste.feed-the-beast.com/view/433593b0 




 \_()_/ 




 Oh, you can certainly make it a mother lode. Make sure it's large vein size. That allows you to set it to as high of a vein size as you want. I've got motherlodes with vein sizes upwards of 100. Nearly solidly fill a whole chunk of stone. 









 Lookit that handsome face. 




 It seems to really just be the first big accomplishment. I work for FTB, and I've still got the Running Red flair. 




 My point? It's different. Surely you complained about the first pack you played that had Hunger Overhaul, or Iguana's Tweaks for Tinkers (hardcore style), or not allowing you to sleep through the night. This is a challenge just like those, it just hasn't been done before. However, apparently every other person who's played Pathfinder has felt that the inventory restrictions were unsatisfactory.

And yet, over 50,000 people have played Jaded's Agrarian Skies 2. Which has the exact same inventory mod. Out of those 50,000, I've only found two that complained in the slightest about it. Yet for Pathfinder, almost everyone does. 




 Is it just any combination of mods thrown together? Does it need to have no config changes? Would you classify [Phoenix Reborn](http://forum.feed-the-beast.com/threads/1-7-10-phoenix-reborn-tech-magic-progression-ores.59301/) as a Kitchen Sink pack, or [Dark Trilogy](http://forum.feed-the-beast.com/threads/1-7-10-the-dark-trilogy-public-beta.51854/)? Does something like [Infinitech 2](http://forum.feed-the-beast.com/threads/1-7-10-infitech-2-modpack-v2-1-8-1-gregtech-balanced-hard-mode-modpack-updated-4-2-2015.50185/) count? [Blood N Bones](http://forum.feed-the-beast.com/threads/public-pack-blood-n-bones.31815/)?

 The beauty of this is that it doesn't need to rely on timers to do it - it gets activated when there is Livingrock/wood available. No errors made there, without the need for CC, OC, or SFM. 




 Obviously for Livingwood - input logs into the system and replace the Livingrock under the Rannuncarpus with Livingwood.

Bluepower could of course be replaced with Project:Red or even vanilla wiring, but who likes that. The Block Placer could be replaced with another Rannuncarpus, and the Terrain Smashers with Mana Spreaders with the Boring Lens. 
























 He's waiting for NOVAA 




 The following is a transcription of an audio tape found in an abandoned prison, around a dozen bodies.

March 2nd, 1965. 5:00 pm. My senior year of High School.


Getting plenty of sleep, I presume? he asked me. The cool spring air drifted in from the window, diminishing the intense heat that plagued the office. Sweat dripped off of the doctors long nose as his mouth fidgeted, appearing to chew on something that wasnt there. His eyes flew from his paper, to me, to Anna, and back to the paper. His irises were dark enough that you couldnt tell for the life of you where the pupil ended and where the mock color began.

Yeah, plenty I responded. Anna made eye contact with me, as she knew that was a lie. By that point in my life, sleep wasnt high on my list of priorities. I worked the night shift to collect enough money to get by, and my ability to stay alert during those hours was fueled purely by caffeine and horror stories. I wished that I could get more, but if I still wanted to be able to go to college next year, rest wasnt an option.

Are you two, uh, sexually active in any way? Dr. Lanius questioned, glancing down at his clipboard, then quickly at Anna, then back at me.

No, not yet, I replied. Anna and I had only known each other since Sophomore year, and right from the start I would have given my life to protect her. I asked her out a month after we met, and wed been dating since.

Ah, I, uh, why dont you tell me a little, uh, more about your relationship? His breathy voice was getting on my nerves. My parents urged me to come to the doctors office at least every six months, something that I was ordinarily fine with. However, the latest addition to the roster of physicians, Dr. Lanius, had begun to irritate me.

I dont think thats anything you need to know, I said sternly, standing up and reaching for my jacket. Every visit Id had with him, Lanius had proceeded to ask more and more personal questions, and by now, I was fed up.

Ah, yes, yes, yes, youre probably right, you can go now he muttered after staring at me. Turning his gaze to Anna, he said See you both back soon.

As I walked out of the room with Anna, I looked back to see Lanius staring at us, his fingers tapping madly against the clipboard. I yanked the door shut behind us, stampeding my way out of the office.

Would you like to schedule a later appointment? called the receptionist as I sped past.

No, thank you, I replied, pushing my way past the doors and into the open. The snow around us was just beginning to melt away, giving the air a cool and crisp smell. The trees had yet to grow their leaves, but the grass was already green and blooming with life. In a couple more months, summer would be upon us. I felt Anna pulling at my hand, and turned to look at her. She had long blonde hair and green eyes, and a smile that could have stopped a missile if she had wanted, or stopped the stars if she was willing.

William, he was just asking what he needed to ask, she pleaded with me.

Yeah, I know, I replied, but it just seems like he wants to know so much about us. After a while I stop being comfortable with that.

Im sure itll be fine, Anna grinned, Now, you promised me wed go to see The Sound of Music today. Unable to resist her smile, I led her to my car.

June 2nd, 1965. 4:00 pm.


The sun pounded down on us as we walked away from school. There was only about a week left until school got out, and just two days until the Friday Dance. Cars out of the parking lot of the school behind us, blasting tunes from the Beach Boys. Anna would sing along for the word or two she remembered before returning to discussing her plans for Friday. All I could think about, however, was the hours I would be awake for tonight.

My blue eyes had dark bags under them from the lack of sleep, and my dirty blond hair was getting greasy. It wasnt an attractive look, but in a few months, I would be at college and it would all be better. At least, I hoped it would. I was running low on horror stories, and Im fairly certain that I was addicted to caffeine.

The sweltering heat surrounded us as we turned the corner, walking past a black van as Anna went on about the dress she was going to wear and I wished I were in bed. There were only four blocks of identical suburban houses left before we got to my house, but I would always walk Anna four more to her house, to make sure she would get home safely.

I looked around, taking in our surroundings. The trees stood still due to the lack of a breeze, and the sky emanated life, without a cloud in it. A red Buick whizzed down the street, and a black van took its time behind us. At least if I had to toil through the nights, I could live for the days.

Hey, said Anna, Lets play I Spy, okay? You go first.

Alright, I laughed, I spy with my little eye a tall, green object.

A tree, she giggled, cmon, thats not even hard. Let me show you how its done. I spy with my little eye something square.

I stopped and looked around for a square object, my eyes passing over a black van that was slowing down next to us. I glanced over at the nearest house before my eyes snapped back to the van. Grabbing Annas hand, I slowly started walking down the street. The van sped up behind us. I started walking faster, scanning for a road we could take that wouldnt let the van through. Unable to find any means of escape, I started running, pulling Anna behind me. Suddenly, she dropped to the ground, pulling me down with her. I attempted to sit up, but found myself unable to. My eyes closed, and fell asleep. I was equal parts terrified and relieved that I was getting some rest.

---
June 2nd, 1965. 6:00pm.


I rolled over, refusing to get up. The alarm hadnt gone off yet, meaning I at least had a few minutes more to rest. I didnt want to open my eyes and break the spell. Suddenly, I heard Annas voice.

William, William, please, get up, she whispered, I dont know where we are but your Doctor is here andIthinkyouwererightabouthimohWilliam. She spoke so quickly that her words blended together. I sat up quickly, almost immediately awake. We were in a dark and cold room, with almost no moisture in the air at all. I was laying in a bare-bones prisoners cot, and Anna was pressed against me, terrified. We both wore nothing but blue patients outfits. Across the room, Dr. Lanius sat with his legs spread apart and his hands on his knees. He was wearing a set of green scrubs, and his mouth and nose were hidden behind a surgeons mask.

Old sawbones has a few tricks up up his sleeve, it appears, he muttered, in a voice just loud enough for it to echo around the room and into the hallway, Now, do follow me. Or you could stay here and wait the Nurse to prep you, but that might be a long wait.

He giggled to himself, amused, and then stood up slowly, and started walking down the hallway. He stopped, looking back at us, and motioned for us to come along. We both sat as still as statues for a moment, and then I got off of the cot, and took Annas hand. We followed Laniuss slow saunter down seemingly endless twists and turns before arriving at a metal balcony overlooking a room full of what appeared to be corpses. Anna put a hand to her mouth as we walked in, and I squeezed her hand. I would get her out of this.

You see, Ive been conducting these experiments on the effects of sensory deprivation on the mind, said Lanius, facing the bodies, but unfortunately, adults arent very good at conveying their emotions. After many attempts to make them say what they felt, I realised they were no good. So, Ive turned to what I believe to be the perfect solution. Why not use angsty teenagers? Theyre all about emotions, arent they?

As he said the last phrase, he turned to the two of us, looking as if he expected a response. When he didnt get one, he turned back to the dead, and was about to begin speaking when one of the dead interrupted him:

HELP! cried the man, completely motionless, except for his mouth, I - I CAN SEE HER, I CAN SEE HER, AND SHE WANTS TO CATCH ME, HELP!

Anna cried out and turned to run, but Lanius held out his hand and stopped her. I held her close to me, and when I did, I could feel myself trembling.

Hes not dead, began Dr. Lanius again, hes merely experiencing extreme sensory deprivation. I tried placing them in sensory deprivation tanks, but that didnt produce the data I needed. So, I went to the extreme. First, I gathered some volunteers who were willing to help, and then I performed the surgery.

The basis of the surgery is the severing of nerves. I leave the needed nerves untouched, such as the ones that keep the heart beating or the lungs breathing. But the nerves that allow people to move, or feel, or see, or smell, or hear, or any of that - those are gone. They cant feel or see anything from outside. They are quite literally trapped inside their minds.

At this point a woman interrupted him, weeping, and asking for someone to kill her. Dr. Lanius remained silent, and another man stated how he didnt know if he was alive or dead, and several more proclaimed that something was chasing them, or that they could see loved ones.

Ive left it so they can still speak. They dont have any haptic feedback from it, though. They can talk, but they wont feel themselves talking nor hear themselves. Ive got them all set up with Tape Recorders, so I can listen to what they say, Lanius elaborated, I tell them going in that I want to hear about what they feel, but every one of them quickly descends into asking for death or saying theyre seeing someone. I feed them, clean them, keep them free of waste, all so one of them can tell me how they feel. But I never get it, do I?

Dr. Laniuss entire demeanor had changed from when I would go to the doctors office. He was cold and calculated, and didnt stutter or second-guess a word he said. But one thing remained the same - he kept stealing glances at me and Anna.

Lanius proceeded to spend the next several hours informing us of the procedure, as we sat mortified, unable to speak a word. He went on and on about how he severed the nerves and how he kept the people he operated on alive afterwards. It was several hours later when he glanced at his watch and told us that it was time for rest. He led us back to the place where we woke up, and closed the door behind him without locking it.

Hes killing them, I said to no one in particular.

Hes doing worse than killing them, said Anna in a hushed voice, hes torturing them for the rest of their lives.

We both sat in silence for what seemed like hours. Eventually, Anna laid down on the cot, but I knew she wouldnt be asleep for a while. I felt like we both knew what was going to happen to us, but I had the solace that at least we would be doing it together.

I then started to think about the people. The tortured people, kept in that room, kept in their heads for what could be a certifiable eternity. Unable to move or feel for the rest of their lives, unable to know if anything is real or not. Being buried alive seemed like nothing compared to what awaited us.

I guess I knew, in that moment, that no matter what was going to happen, I was going to end up laying there on that table, as still as the grave, talking maybe to no one, maybe to everyone. If I was going to spend the rest of my life that way, I was going to spend the time I had left saving people from that fate.

Quietly, I got up and moved towards the door. I gently pushed it open, and cringed as it creaked open, its metal hinges grinding on more metal. I followed the twists and turns of what must have been a prison, with our room being a cell, and the room of the barely alive dead being a mess hall. As I arrived there, I crept down the metal staircase and towards the bodies. 

Amidst their shouts and whispers wishing for death, I found the woman who was crying earlier, asking us to kill her. I pulled the tube out of her mouth, and watched as she slowly choked on a lack of air, unable to feel herself doing it, trying to ask me to kill her the whole time. Her sightless eyes open and closed as she retched, attempting to say kill me, incapable of knowing I was doing just that. After a moment, her shaking stopped, and she was gone, freed from her torture.

I moved on to the next body, yanking the tube of air out of his mouth. I didnt wait for him to pass before moving on to the next, going on a spree of euthanasia to free the undead from their torture. I pulled the plug on the last one, and turned to see the clock on the wall strike twelve. Standing underneath it was Dr. Lanius, watching me destroy his work.

---

June 3rd, 1965. 12:03am.


You son of a bitch! yelled Lanius as he tossed me into a cell, opposite of the one where I could see Anna, sitting up from the cot and staring at the scene.

That was my lifes work! We could have, as the human race, have achieved immortality! The ability to truly be free! I just had to know what to do to the bodies to make the people happy! And you ruined it!

Dr. Lanius pulled out a keychain, and proceeded to almost lock the cell door before reconsidering. He grabbed Anna by the arm and me by the scruff of the neck, and dragged us with him. His strength surprised me for the squirrelly old man he had always seemed to be.

He pulled us into a room that was devoid of anything but a skylight, through which moonlight radiated in. Stars filled the night sky, and I attempted to take a snapshot of that sight, in case I was unable to ever see again. Lanius saw me staring and grabbed my head, now forcing me to look out of the window.

Do you think anyone out there is coming to save you? he hissed, Do you think anyone out there even cares about you? No, theyre too preoccupied with their brand new Vietnam war and their race against the Soviets to control the sky! Youre worthless, and you worthlessly destroyed years of work and research, and made it all worthless, you worthless son of a bitch!

You destroyed their lives, I responded, trying to stay calm, They didnt want to live out the rest of their days like that.

Oooh, you want volunteers, do you? Lanius asked. He grabbed Anna and threw her on the floor. How about this. Lets make a deal. Either she gets to go free, or you get to go free. How about that, huh? You volunteer as my new test subject, or you volunteer her as my new test subject! How about that, huh?

Anna looked absolutely terrified, just about as terrified as I felt. Lanius had gone completely crazy, and was yelling, when before all he would do was talk just loud enough for you to hear.

Soooo, Mr. Worthless. Who is it going to be?

I looked up at the stars, and then back down at Anna. I thought of the moon, and then of her smile. The smile that could stop a missile. The smile that could stop the stars.

Take me, I said.

You ever wonder if the hero of a story questions whether the decisions he made were the right ones? I do. I cant tell whats real anymore, and whats my imagination. This could have happened in hours, or in days.

I dont know anything, really. All I know is I need to talk, and hope my story is heard.

I dont know if he actually let Anna go.

I dont know if it was worth giving my life for hers.

I dont know anything. Im just lost in my mind.

I sometimes wonder how long it will be before I forget things. I cant hold on to every memory forever. But I feel I have to. Im trapped in a prison of memories, far worse than that cold cell. Once I lose my memories, what do you think I will be?

I sometimes wonder if theres someone here. If I was rescued, and if Im in a hospital right now, about to be cured.

I sometimes wonder if I was rescued and there is no cure.

I sometimes wonder if I will ever be rescued. 




 Happy Cake Day, and yes, support has ended for it. I'm thinking at this point I might as well go and update it, because of that very reason. 




 Yeah 









 Oops, my bad. Failed to scroll down that far on the side xD 




 \o/ 









 You tried Refined Relocation? 




 Nope, we've done all we can. It's on Pahimar's side. All of our issues have been on the github for a while, just waiting on him. 




 Nickel and Platinum do not spawn. I know there's a recipe that needs platinum with OpenModularTurrets (oversight on my part), but is there anything that you actually need it for? 




 Swamp Thing is the first PBN song 




 The transition music between Haywyre and Porter was Halsey - Ghost (Lost Kings Remix) 




 Vanilla+ is designed for scenarios like this 




 Probably not. There's not anything stopping you from adding it yourself, though. Just keep in mind that we probably won't support issues you have unless you can reproduce it w/o added mods.

(also you may want to delete the ae2 config file if you do add it) 




 I sort of rewrote the pack halfway through. Original modlist:

It was more based around Thermal Expansion and AE2 - but considering most of the complaints from the original Horizons involved having those two mods, I decided to re-do it to involve Mekanism and etc. The goal was to avoid any gameplay mods in Infinity, unless they had a sufficient number of addons. AE came close to making it back in, but it's been in almost every FTB pack since it was released. 




 If it doesn't get added to Infinity, I'm going to add it to Horizons. 




 Which version are you running?

Also, it's probably related to this issue: http://forum.feed-the-beast.com/threads/1-0-0-galacticraft-oil-acting-like-items-we-can-pick-up.95531/ 




 Mekanism, Engineer's Toolbox, Aura Cascade, and EssentialCraft III all have Ore Doubling mechanisms. 




 Not to mention adding a variety of RFTools, such as a [block protector](https://github.com/McJty/RFTools/wiki/RFTools-Block-Protector), [a crafter](https://github.com/McJty/RFTools/wiki/RFTools-Crafter), [screens](https://github.com/McJty/RFTools/wiki/RFTools-Screen), [a spawner](https://github.com/McJty/RFTools/wiki/RFTools-Spawner), [a power relay](https://github.com/McJty/RFTools/wiki/RFTools-Power-Relay), [modular storage](https://github.com/McJty/RFTools/wiki/RFTools-Modular-Storage), and so much more. Direwolf actually has spotlights on all the things from the mod, and I recommend watching them. It's so much more than just the dimension builder.

 Extra Utilities and Mekanism both offer methods of RF transport, along with a somewhat complicated way using Aura Cascade. 




 You can actually charge stuff straight from the Mekanism Energy Cubes 




 Clockwork Phase probably has the best early game tools, and as for the most complex tech trees, you'd probably go for Mekanism. Aura Cascade and EssentialCraft III are both really in-depth magic mods that you should also definitely check out if you've got the time.

As for automated mining, you've got Mekanism, Extra Utilities, Essentialcraft III, and even Blood Magic to help you out there :) 




 Yup. It'll take a while though, due to some backend stuff. Not much we can do to speed it up. 




 Generally the goal was to not have any mods that were in Infinity in this pack. Obvious exceptions being things like NEI or Chisel. Blood Magic made it in purely on account of it's addons. 




 They obviously loved my beautiful un-customized Twitter background. 




 Oops! Well, it certainly is new to FTB, to say the least.

 Oh my goodness, I would love to get my hands on a mod that does this. Obviously not for legitimate use, but I love the style it gives the cities.
