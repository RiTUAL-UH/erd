 During my broke days in college, I tried duplicating this, buying Eggo Waffles and KFC.  It satisfied the craving, but I doubt I'd ever do it again.  




 Damn I miss Josh Morgan 




 Depends on your tone and your approach.  I read your sentence in 2 voices.  Creepy gay stalker voice, and regular voice.  That being said, it's a compliment, but the creepy voice can easily jar anyone.   




 Came here to add the same thought.  Japanese love KFC, but they make it sound like it's the norm for Xmas.  A few weeks there was a similar website where they listed breakfast from all over the world.  They put tofu as a breakfast item for Japanese.  Not even clos 




 I can't say with confidence that Alex is good enough to take us all the way.  Same can be said that if we find ourselves in a shootout where we have to air it out, I'm not confident of resting the game on Alex's arm.  Of course the O-line needs to improve as well, but if there is a free agent QB that's available I'd like to see us pick him up.  The playbook is only 1/2 open, let's go full playbook and see what happens.   




 Congratulations, enjoy!   




 The power of Reddit, helping hemophiliacs one day at a time.  Update:  I since have spoken to our fellow bleeder, and am trying to get him hooked up with Baxter.  Baxter was actually in our office the other day and this story was brought to their attention.  They're trying to take action immediately.  Btw, were you at Chicago for the Annual Meeting back in Nov?   




 Grades might not be the best motivator for learning, but as a whole we've taken out the concept of competition + challenge.  Now this might be due to the fact I grew up in a Asian house hold where grades were the end all be all.  But I notice these days, we coddle our children too much where there are no losers.  Watch this piece on 60 min about "Millenials"  and you'll see the result happening.  (http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/11/08/60minutes/main3475200.shtml)

The motivation has to come from parents, but grades can be a motivational booster.  Who doesn't want to score the least amongst your friends in class?  It's competition, something we've abandoned and have now let kids feel entitled.

 Here's my St. Patty's Day tradition.  Pick up a 4 pack of Guinness.  Pour 2 cans, (1 is not enough) along with the other herbs, and such.  Add only a bit of water, you want the Guinness to reduce.  Simmer for 3-4 hours till tender.  

As for the cabbage part, I like doing with a modern twist.  Slice cabbage and saute in olive oil, S+P.  Meanwhile reduce some balsamic vinegar til reduces and becomes a syrup.  Drizzle balsamic over cabbage, drink the other 2 Guinness and begin bar hopping.

 And Seattle beat the Ravens also 




 You're question is 2 part.  #1, 49ers are contenders.  Week in and week out we play competitively, enough to make the game close.  

Which leads to #2.  Alex Smith IS not the 49ers.  He's not greatest, we put him in situations that'll help us win.  Call it what you want, he manages the games and he makes enough plays.  But our Defense is legit, enough to be considered a contender.  Our special teams is elite, and our Run Offense is one of the best.  All those make the 49ers contenders.  If you don't agree then you're watching another type of football.  

Stop trolling.

 McDonald's Worker holding a metal rod 




 I was at The Venitian in Las Vegas for a bachelor party.  A bunch of us were partying in the room with strippers, booze, drugs.  
The strippers weren't the hottest, and their attitude really sucked.  They were demanding $$$ for bullshit, for instance 50.00 per dance, 100.00 for their clothes off.  We got sick of them quick and kicked them out.  That pissed them off because a few minutes later, security knocked on the door.  They forced their way in, and raided the place.  5 ginourmous guards stormed in shouting at us demanding to show us where to drugs were.  Luckily we flushed the coke, but couldn't hide the weed.  
They found the OZ of weed, took all our pics with us holding our drivers license, and that's why I can never step foot in the Venitian again.

To this day, I still swear by it.  People have hooked me up, I've hooked them up.  This guy sounds like he's keeping tabs on everything.  If he's keeping tabs on silly things such as trees, imagine if you're in a situation where he's really got you.  No need for people such as him in your life.

 My thoughts are very raw on this matter.  Just a few weeks ago, the whole city commemorated 9/11, by remembering the brave fireman, cops, citizens etc.  There was a feeling of peace, respect, and more importantly UNITY.  The whole world watched as we mourned and came together as a city.   
Fast forward to Occupy Wall Street, and it's like we took a 180 degree turn.  Now don't get me wrong, I am in full support of the protests, and hope their voice is heard globally.  And yes, the COPS fucked up on this.     
Having lived in NYC for 2 years now, I've concluded NYPD is a bunch of assholes, and there is almost a sort of pedestal these guys expect to be on after 9/11.  Now after this last incident, they're rep is back to being shit, and there's a feeling of "Us vs Them"  
As a society, when 9/11 comes around again next year do we all have pity and bow our heads to pay respects to Cops?  This ass backwards behavior US has is least surprising IMO.  And once again the whole world watches as we collide and crash against each other, making us look juvenile and incapable of handling crisis.

 Not literally...

Usually my approach has been direct, sometimes too much. The way I see it, if the girl bites then game one. There are times it gives off the relationship vibe too early, which has come back to bite me in the ass. How do I change this up so I can still appear interested without giving away too much? The backstory to this was that I met a amazing girl that just got out of a relationship. I tried taking the slow route, but it ended up backfiring. And I knew she was into me.

She's turning 28 next month, I'm 33. I'm pretty blunt usually, sometimes too straight forward. It kinda got awkward with the last girl, but at least it cuts the BS. I also wear my emotions on my sleeve, good or bad.

The backstory to this was that I met a amazing girl that just got out of a relationship.  I tried taking the slow route, but it ended up backfiring.  And I knew she was into me.   




 **Backstory**I met a awesome girl recently at a friends house. The only kicker was that her and her bf just broke up recently. I was getting the vibe the whole time we hung out, so I thought. A few weeks ago I got enough brave juice in me to ask her out, she said yes and the following weekend we hung out the whole time.

Knowing she's still fresh out, I acted my best and did not push at all. Ironically, this back fired as she made the move on me. We hooked up, things were great. I thought it was a amazing weekend, shared stories, similar upbringings, partied, laughed..everything.

So then a few weeks pass by, we talk on the phone briefly, was kinda awkward but didnt' think much. Then 2 days ago she asked me out, only to bail on me later. Today I get email saying she only wants to be friends. So with the info at hand, was I the "getting over my ex" booty call?

The only thing I can think of is that I might've given off more a relationship vibe than anything else. I did make her a mix cd, and a short story I wrote. I figured it was a worthy gamble. Also all this happened in NYC, a city unlike any other, where dating can be absolutely amazing or fucked. Often times in 1 week!
TL;DR Met a amazing girl that just broke up with her bf, I hook up with her although I didn't make the first move. Developed feelings, now she wants to be friends.   



















 A few weeks ago I met someone amazing (the white rhino), you know the kind where you can't stop thinking of them, that rare beauty you run into once every few years.  
We've hung out a few times, nothing serious, but I've been getting the good vibe overall.  She even informed me things weren't going well with her bf, and sounded as though things were going to end. (I didnt even ask her) Last time she even said, "I probably won't be talking to him" 
So last nite I finally summoned up the courage to ask her out. Although it didn't come out the smoothest, I still put it out there.  She responded, "I'm still with him..trying to work things out."  I asked how that was going, and all she said was "it's going"...Of course I tried to play it cool, and told her to let me know if anything changes.  
My question fellow Redditors.  I can handle the rejection, but was I missing some huge sign that I wasn't aware of.  Was this a flat out no, or do I still have a shot in the long term?  

 




 The backstory:  I recently met someone pretty amazing, we've hung out a few times so far, and my gut is telling me she likes me.  We went out last night, got pretty buzzed, danced alot.  I went home and ended up drunk texting her.  Nothing insane was written, but I did say I want to hear her story over dinner sometime.  I woke up today realizing what I did, immediately regretting it.  Sorta chickened out I feel like.  I feel like I might've killed any momentum, and she hasn't texted back a reply.

 The backstory:  A good friend of mine passed away in Dec due to cardiac arrest, he had pulmonary hypertension.  (33 y.o)  Three years ago, he met the love of his life, until the dumb whore went to Costa Rica and cheated on him.  The bitch got pregnant as well.  When she came back, she moved out of his apt and out of his life.  Fast forward today:  My friend's facebook page is still up and running, (his parents decided to keep it) people like to leave messages, posts, pics etc.  

Out of nowhere, this girl comes out of the woodworks and starts posting.  Everyday it's something, "I miss your touch, smile..."  Yada yada yada...Attention starving whore

Bottom line it's pissing me off now.  Only a few of us knew she cheated on him, everyone else thinks she's some sweet gal.  Out of respect for his FB page, I'm not going to bust her out.  But I can send her a message.  I need input on this.  Call me out if I'm accused of being a troll.  

TL;DR:  A girl who cheated on my friend who passed away is leaving annoying Facebook posts on his page.  I can see thru her B.S.  What should I do?   




 Last nite I began to feel the onset of a cold.  Nothing serious.  Went out for drinks which consisted of Jameson shots, 2 Stellas, and Henneseey with Ginger Ale.  Fast forward today, I feel fine.  I've done this a few times and it works.  My theory is, either I piss out everything, or the internal body temperature kills whatever strain it was.

 I work in a typical office, cubicle style.  The last 2 days the girl next to me has been hackin 24-7, to the point where it's annoying to hear, and it's kinda nasty.  By no means am I a germaphobe, I'm just trying not to get sick.  Is it wrong to go up and ask/tell her to go home?  What's your stance on this?  BTW, the excuse of I don't want to use PTO/or Sick days is BS.

 If you choose not to attend the wedding, don't tell the fiance either.  My reasoning, is that you're choosing to cut him out of your life completely.  You're acknowledging that he is not your brother.  However by informing the fiance, you're now taking a step back into his life.  Furthermore you're potentially opening up old wounds.  

If you're going to tell the fiance, send a letter, no return address so they don't know who it's from.  At least this way you're not getting caught up in the BS 




 If you're looking for re sale value, I wouldn't go with the studio.  Most young professionals come to NY for X number of years, and by the time they're wanting to settle down a studio is not what they have in mind.  If you can, go with a 1BR.

 Exactly this.  I'd like to know the backstory to this.  Was there hardcore texts being passed back n forth?  Were they drunk as hell?  It was their first time hooking up, and they went dominant rough right from the start.  That's an open invitation right there.  I'm not saying what the guy did was right, but there's many variables that come into play here.   




 What kind of messages were said back and forth leading up to this?    Clearly this guy took it overboard and violated you, but if you showed signs of wanting to be dominated and taken, this goes both ways.  This was your first time hooking up, you're gonna be going 100 m.p.h with excitement and such.

You've got to pony up a little bit and think what drove this guy to lose it.  Was there booze involved, how many texts back and forth were there, nature of conversation, etc.  Cops are gonna be all over this asking you how you even allowed him to enter your house and hook up?  As much as you are the victim here, when the cops question you and the incident, you need to make sure everything adds up.  There is a huge grey area when it comes to this unfortunately.

 Japanese fella here.  Although the dad is clearly being abusive, it's sorta common for the men to just yell at their wives.  It's Old School mentality.  Is it right?  Absolutely not, but the mom doesn't have alot of options. It's not like here in the states where there's support groups, organizations etc.  Sadly, psycho social support in Japan is not on top of the list.  

And unless there is complete followthru, I actually disagree and she shouldn't inform the organization.  She's only staying for a year or two tops, it's a different dynamic she's witnessing than if she were there for 5 years.

 Chef friend of mind in CA recently got married.  During his break, the dishwashers asked him when he's gonna have kids.

 Not sure how much football you've watched or understand, but it takes all 11 players to do their job in order for the play to happen.  Not the 3 out of 11 being a meat shield.

 My first guess is this has to be a summer camp skit 




 I'm simply calling you out on your "I'm from Texas" statement.  Your references of beef, eggs, and music are all 1 dimensional.  If Texas was even remotely as diverse as SF, I wouldn't even trip.  
 
For example, what's Texas eggs? Drenched in oil, butter, add tons bacon, potatoes.  I don't have an issue if you don't like Japanese eggs, but again I wouldn't bet the house on anything culinary from Texas.  Who is your famous chef?  Tim Love, cmon now.    

Texas Music, first that comes to mind, twangy whack ass country music.  Again how many dimensons?  I can say legitimately that SF is diverse and we can back up our arguments across the board from music to food.  And yes I'm also Japanese so I do know the culture and the gentle complex flavors that are associated with our food.  

Finally fuck the Cowboys!

 What's remarkable about him, is how passionate he takes his job.  Not saying that making sushi is mundane, but after doing it for over 50 years, he still takes his trade so seriously.

 Return fire has no bearing on this matter.  He pointed a fucking gun in one of the busiest streets in the world.  Shit is gonna go down.  

As for the bystanders, how fast can you process and react to what was happening around you?  Unless you grew up in a war torn country I.e Iraq, no way you would ever imagine a gun fight during morning commute.  Youre gonna run frantically, every which way possible.  Even towards the chaos.  




 Here come the Monday morning quarterback comments.  Look, you can sit here and analyze the video and say "the academy teaches you this and that," but at the end the officer put himself in the line of fire.  
Im not siding with the cops, but it's real easy from our vantage point to criticize the way it was handled, incompetent or not.  Most cops never have use their firearm in their lifetime, esp nypd.

 Should be fine, you're using some strong spices that beer won't alter the flavor.  Maybe add a touch of beef stock or water, but I wouldn't stress on it.  Post pics and let us know how it turned out.   




 You're claiming it's a myth, I'm arguing there is actual fact.  Grades might not be distinguished the same as beef (prime, choice, etc) but fresh fish that I was eating daily in Japan+NYC was "sashimi grade" compared to the places you've worked i.e (farm rasied)  Dunno where you live, but in NYC where I work and live, sashimi is flown in from Japan+Australia daily.  

I agree places like Whole Foods will get away with their "sashimi" but scientific fact, when the brain of the fish is pierced and lactic acid is minimal, you're getting the best of the best.  I know that's what I'm getting.

 Mexican officer, late 30's.  His partner was young 20 yr fresh out of the academy. Dude was so stoked to bust me.  I'm asian, in my 30's but young looking.  He didn't seem upset really, and I did not sound off at him.  It was a busy Friday night, streets were packed and people walking around.  Maybe it was the energy.  I do remember the commanding officer showed up in a unmarked car.  He asked the arresting officer, "do want to go ahead and process?"  Almost had my hopes up for second.  




 No fines.  Technically my case is sealed shut, but can re open if I do something stupid again.  As much as NYC is strict and cops are asses,it is one of the few states that is liberal for 1st time offenders of weed.  The ACD law has been around since the 70's.  I haven't done a background search on myself yet, but from what I've read the ACD is sealed from any outside sources.   




 Busted last summer on the corner of Bleeker and Bowery.  3 of us were passing a joint around on the street, cop car pulled up and arrested us on the spot.  

The time frame last about 3 1/2 hours from beginning to end.  After getting printed, processed, and what seemed like an eternity, we were let go.  My court date was 2 months later.  That lasted 15 min tops, judge gave me a A.C.D (Adjournment for Court Dismissal). End of story.

 Even if you're loaded on Vicodin, no way in hell you go on a killing rampage.  If you're on Oxy then you're even less inclined bc you'll be so subdued.  He might have been on anti-depressants, or some psycho tropic drug, but not pain meds.   




 They sweated him because he checked "yes" on whether he was arrested or not.  Plus he's famous.  Normal folks with a record can still get thru no problem.  When they scan your passport your personal history doesn't show up.  No such thing as private security companies, airports are government related in japan.  You are right about xenophobic 




 He only got caught bc he's famous, and he probably checked "yes" for have you ever been arrested.  I've got a record, and each time in customs I've gone thru no problem.  When your passport is scanned your criminal history doesn't show up unless for a serious offense i.e murder, drugs.  There's no way databases are linked globally at airports.

 You didn't answer the 2nd question.  If the higher ups failed to take any action, and Ramos was still out there doing his thing, what would you do?  How far do you go to see him get reprimanded?  Do you risk your own job?   

It's hypothetical, but let's be real.  There's a general code amongst the blue boys.  My point is, there's Ramos everywhere doing illegal shit 24-7.  How much of it is tolerated is a question unanswered, but from an outsider, I wonder who would stand up and intervene.   




 Curious question.  Let's say you knew this guy Ramos, and what he was doing.  Would you turn him in?  One step further, let's say you do report him and no action was taken.  What lengths would you take to see him reprimanded?

 I was fortunate to go to private school bc my parents (japanese) believed in good education.  About 90% of my classmates were white, (wealthy white) while the other 10% were asian+black.  I was able to attend bc of finanical aid.  At a early age I saw firsthand just how different a mindset these kids had vs the minorities.  It was self entitlement and this general attitude of being spoiled and saying/doing outrageous shit thinking it's completely acceptable. 


The one thing I still get annoyed with is when I deal with entitled rich white punks who think they run the shit.  It's a certain arrogance and mindset that exists.  Now that I'm living in NYC I see it 24-7 especially around midtown.  My friends and I like to call them Chad's + Brad's and or Wall St Douchebags.

 Good question.  When I have people over, I use a burner stove so that I can cook on the table, but you can also do it over stove top.  Not a rolling boil, but a good simmer.  The key is getting the beef cut super thin (paper thin 1/16").   You basically want to dip the meat and swirl in the water for a few seconds max.  Veggies will take longer.   




 Japanese style foundue minus the cheese.  Thin sliced meats and veggies get cooked quickly in a broth, and dip with sauces.   




 I used to work for a home health care agency, part of the job was to deliver meds to people with chronic illness.  One client was a 17 year old with severe arthritis which prompted him to be dependent on pain killers.  Month by month I noticed his orders of opiates began to increase not only in quantity but strength.  He began to lose weight fast, and his skin color was pale from being indoors.  It got so bad  there would be times I would go over to his house and while we were talking he would doze off in mid sentence.

One day during my delivery, I pulled him aside and told him my concern.  Of course this could have totally gotten me fired bc it really wasn't any of my business, but I felt the need to say something.  It was a short stern talk, and really didn't expect much from it.  

A year later, and I moved to NY and I get a friend request from him on Facebook.  My eyes began to water as I looked thru his pictures.  Not only did he move out of his home, he got a job working IT, became super fit and tanned.  He thanked me the talk because no one else (not even mom) gave a shit.   




 That's bc it's mostly korean exchange students around that area.  (language schools)  Next time when you're inside, take a look around and see the average age.  Personally I love woorijip bc of their selection.

 Yeah I've been on C.L the last few days, I feel like the window for stolen goods is prob 48 hours tops before it gets flipped.   




 I just wanted to see the process from beginning to end of what exactly takes place.  I'd rather hear a cop be straight up and tell me "look, there's not much we can do." Giving me #'s to call, waiting for detectives is just wasting time.   




 Backstory:  Last nite I left the front window open in my living room, woke up in the morning to find the screen window busted open and 2 of my wife's lap tops missing.  The laptops were sitting on the couch.  It was a pretty brave move on the burglars part, only because he would have had to actually open a gate, peak in from a ledge, and then break the screen.  Either way, it was a shitty feeling, and we should have known better.  


So we decide to call the cops, 4 huge dudes (more like gorillas) came in did some paper work, told us a detective would come by to do some prints.  They told us not to touch a thing because its all evidence, blah blah, and handed us a "incident information slip".  They gave us a # to call to report this matter in order to receive a complaint report #.  We've tried calling this number all day yesterday and today, no answer.   


I'm in no way expecting to find my laptop, I know its a lost cause.  But is this really the case where cops come in, give you a slip of paper and act like they're working only to have you run in circles?  Why couldn't they issue a Report # on the spot so a file could be started?  Anyone else have similar incidents?    




 As a native SF, we've been calling it the city for decades.  Even our hoops team has a [sweatshirt](http://kazowie.com/wespreston/B-Day+%6010/Golden+State+Warriors+The+City+Pullover+Hoodie)

 I'm surprised your black buddies spider senses didn't tingle up and tell you to not even step foot inside the bar.  I know my friends would immediately say something. Sorry this happened 




 It was our first date, we were dancing at a concert in Prospect Park.  All night long we just grooved out, and at the end of the night a club promoter handed a flyer and told us to come to his party because he liked our dancing.  

When I told him this was our first date, he said "you guys look like you've been together for awhile!"  I kinda already had the feeling she was "the one", but the club promoter sealed the deal.

 Here's the thing, the giants are the big picture when it comes to getting to the Super Bowl.  We saw what happened this year, Harbs saw, we all saw it.  We need to get it down the field against them, no check downs, none of that.   




 This is gold.  Thank you 




 Trade him to the Chiefs for Eric Berry.  They need a qb, and we could use a corner 




 Blinded by the light 




 Every Alex lover is so quick to bring up stats to defend him its comical.  The fninshed product that was displayed today wasn't just today.  It's been brewing since training camp.  Harbs and the staff have been knowing this.  If you can't notice the difference of today's offense and Alex, I dunno what to tell you.  

Urban Meyer made Tebow look dope in the same offense Alex was in..  Still in denial?   




 It's not based off data.  It's the flow of the game, the way the offense flows.  Of course because your so hung up on Alex, you're too blinded to see a difference.   




 I.E last year and this years giants game . 




 Yeah try telling your argument to harbaughs face and see what he says.  I know your mad, I would be too.  But these years sticking up for alexis is done.  Get with it. You think Harbs really meant it when he said smith was a pro bowl qb last year?  Fuck no.   




 Look we're all fans of the same team, but the Alexsexuals need to go.  The door is to the right, thanks for playing.

 Yes indeed, and any kind of mention of kaep gets down voted quick style.  
 




 Brady.   




 At the end of it all, what's your confidence level in Alex taking us to a Super Bowl?  I'm not saying kaep is it. In no way have I suggested that.  However given the small window we have, the room for errors is smaller than before 




 That's why we as fans let it be.  Plain and simple.  They see something we don't  




 In order to win history says you need a viable qb.  That's a fact.  Now whether or not Alex is that guy is not up To us.  But from what I've seen, kaep has done it more than Alex has in his given time. Whether he can do it for more than 2 years up is remained to be seem, but you can argue that there is a qb debate .  Like it or not  




 Name a Super Bowl winning qb other than Dilfer that has played it safe like Alex has.  There is none.  And the year after the Ravens won, they cut his ass.  Now, while i think Alex is better than Trent, why is there even mention of a qb controversey?  If Alex was doing what he's supposed to be doing, why is there talk of kaep? 




 At the end, the goal is to win a Superbowl.  And right now, what's standing between us and a Superbowl is a QB IMO.  My point of "pulling the trigger" means that we push the ball and make plays.  Not go for the safe read that Alex does over and over.  

I never mentioned once about entertainment in my post.  I'm saying Kaep is making plays, and is doing so in ways I haven't seen Alex do in the last 7 years.   




 I've been watching the games.  What I didn't emphasize in my post (which I should have) is that in 1 game, we saw Kaep pull the trigger more times than I've seen Alex.  

You provided proof in your post with plays he did, but in all honesty you're bringing up 2 plays from 2 different games.  .  I know it's only been 1 game with Kaep, but again he's not shy and he's pulling the trigger on plays.  The game you mentioned 80 yd bomb with Ted Ginn, Alex also missed a wide open Delanie Walker post 1st play of the game.  
And that's where I notice the contrast of QB's.  Alex is safe, cerebral, will not push it down field.  Kaep makes plays with his feet, often improvising which results in bigger plays.   




 Exactly this.  Not once have I ever seen Alex try and throw the 20 yard out pattern towards the sidelines.  Or go for the bomb.  If you watch the replay again, kaep does exactly that on the initial drive.  

Alex might have the "cerebral" aspect of the game, but kaep makes plays period.  Kaep has "it".  Alex, not as much  




 You got the cool ranch dorritos to top it off as well.   




 you made an asian sandwich, wouldn't call it banh mi  




 My gf wanted to go to his sushi/mex resto in Sacramento.  Reluctantly I agreed, easily the worst decision I ever made  




 I saw this post on Facebook earlier.  It said later nypd tried to wash away the body and evidence.   




 Getting married to my wife.  Shaking hands and meeting the Dalai Lama.   




 My friends were denied going into a club in Korea because of age.  Mind you, they're in their 30's.  And both were Korean

 Incorrect.  Sushi rice has vinegar, sugar.  Onigiri is plain steamed japanese rice which can have flavors such as furikake, salt, kombu etc, but never vinegar.  Onigiri is onigiri.   




 So you know, sushi rice and onigiri are 2 different types of rice.   




 Stephen A is fuckin annoying, and it's clear ESPN loves and encourages his antics.  But what's annoying is he never played the game, he's a analyst.  If he were an ex player, even at the college lever I'd give him some respect.

 Friend was the CEO 




 I'm always wondering how these NFL guys are wearing beats during pre game warmups.  Makes no sense whatsoever trying to run full speed with shitty headphones all.  

And they should know for the kind of money they're making, they could get amazing wireless ones.   




 A piece of advice a friend gave to me when I moved out here 3 years ago.  He said, "whatever effort you put into this city, whether it's meeting new people, going to events, etc..It comes back to you 10x"  

I took his advice to heart, and really pushed the boundaries.  To summarize, I met a amazing woman and got married last year.  As for my friend (the one with the advice), he came to NY with less than 1K in his bank account and minimal experience as a stylist.  He know styles hair for all the major fashion shoots, is known and respected internationally.  

Come out here and live the life you've wanted.  Go get it!   




 Glad to know the baby is doing better.  I know this might sound weird, but if Reddit is still around 20 years from now, I'd love to see the baby do AMA.  Your style of telling his story is quite interesting, and although it's sad, would love to know down the road how he turns out.   




 So often do you guys have sex in the kitchen?   




 and what? born n raised in cali as well.  you're talking a minute section of bushwick that has mexican immigrants, compared to cali where the influence is everywhere.   




 If it's martial arts poses, it goes like "Wah!!! Wata!!"   




 4-1 odds they still aren't legit like Cali.  NYC just can't do Mexi food for some reason or another 




 Because white people are the majority, they do what the fuck they please.  British and Aussie are still derivatives from the English language.  But the moment you take something foreign and "weird" sounding, and voila you get mocking/mimicking.  
For the record I'm asian, and have witnessed this shit everywhere.  People still do "ching chong", this and that, thinking it's funny.   




 They killed her because they wanted bike parts?   




 Bingo.  There's a bunch of east bay folks that are pro Niner/A's.   




 I find some of this hard to believe.  You really had no clue, no red flags, not even a inkling of a doubt before you got married?  As much as you're getting hurt here, you gotta look at yourself and ask how did you get  here?  Shit like this doesn't happen overnight.  What led to this, and why couldn't you see this happen earlier?  Man up, divorce and get to the root of you.  Both of you guys fucked up on this one. 




 I don't really follow college too much, but who are some good players coming out this that we can draft?  We need a DB/CB, and prob some DE's as well.   




 Lugers was good, but it wasn't mind blowing.  Keane's is pretty damn good   




 the one and only time ill fork over 30$ for a burger.  




 I sat next to someone the other day who ate that.  They said Minetta Tavern is hands down their favorite steak house, better than Peter Lugers, or Keanes.   




 Why is this in WTF?  has no bearing.   




 I'll be curious as to how far they went to duplicate this burger.  All the elements have to be in order, the right cheese, sauce, etc...Even Brit mayo is different than over here 




 This bitch had some annoying facial expressions 




 To further add on to this....There has to be a new generation of "Niner bandwagoners" out there that are clueless/classless.  I say this because growing up in the 80's and 90's, we were known as a 1st class organization with the best fans.  Fans would never accuse a player of giving away game plans.  

It's the same shit about the stabbings and fights going down in the parking lot these days.  To a certain point, we as fans represent the team.   




 It wasn't a overnight decision, but a gradual one.  It was almost as if each smoke was getting less and less enjoyable to the point where it wasn't feeling as good as it did before.  

That combined with getting a nasty nasty flu which made me quit cold turkey.  So in the end, it was a culmination of the above.  I wasn't one of those people who tried quitting on numerous occassions.  1x and thats it.  Probably because I knew how easy it would be to start again 




 The bun looks off, not in and outish 




 There will always be Alex haters, and games like the one on Sunday will just put him under the microscope more.  I will say this, he has all the necessary resources for him now which means he has to deliver.  If not, you can bet everyone will be calling for Kaep next year.   




 Try it with chocolate milk instead of Baileys next time.  Choc mint schnapps 




 Dallas is pretty shitty BBQ.  Take him to Dinosaur.   




 Our pass rush is nowhere near as lethal as last year.  One of the reasons we can let the secondary be loose was because we pressured the qb so much that he would make hasty decisions.   




 Well..did you or did you not buy the cuff links? 




 Ill grab the popcorn 




 Fuck that!  Any girl that tries to dis your moment with your mom is pretty inconsiderate and rude.  Tell her she needs to respect that shit, or get out.

 I'm glad you addressed this.  I'm seeing similar stuff happen on r/videos.  Esp the top video being reposted hours later. Sometimes even the next day.   




 Hey bitch, it's fags like you that are ruining Reddit.  People are onto your pathetic attempts.  Congratulations, you've discovered the internet.  Now go back to your mom's basement, piss the fuck off.   




 I was thinking pork shoulder as well, doing carnitas tacos.  Pretty filling, and tasty, plus it puts a theme on the diner.   




 My counterpoint.  Lived in the hood before, have hood friends, have done hood shit.  None of that shit scares me.  What does scare me is folks like you. Reasons why below

You're general stereotype reasoning of "pencil thin mustache, earrings, little thug lingo"  shows me just how fucking unintelligent and ignorant you are.  Which gives me enough reason to understand, that you don't know what it's like to be on other side. You'll never know.  Most of us on here are fortunate enough not to.  But it's views like yours that exist and to know you could be in a higher position than the kid in the video and therefore use your reasoning and judge the kid negatively

In your case, your broad based assumptions, along with your narrow sighted views are what enrage me, and will lead me to call you out on your BS.  The cops have no right treating anyone like that.  The kid should suffer and get harrassed because of another person with the same background committed a crime?  Your god damn right you go no problem with what the cops did, because you'll never fuckin get it.   




 This isn't 20 questions, and clearly you're new to Reddit.  You boldly make points in your post claiming the real victims are those who live in neighborhoods.  I can tell you straight up my friends that live in the hood, have pride. They don't consider themselves anything, nonetheless victims. You're making a assumption.  

This topic is all about the kid, and how he is perceived.  You said he walks and talks like a thug.  What's your basis?  This debate is about how you should explain yourself.  B/C if you truly think this kid is what a thug embodies both external and internal experience, you would be terrified thinking every single male youth in the inner city is a thug.  I disagree with every point you bring, not because of you.  Because there is no validity.  You're trying to sink this argument down to something else.  So, care to explain more?   




 I'm asking you to further explain yourself.  Simple as that.  Can you do that?   




 Whats your basis for what a thug walks and talks like?  boyz n the hood?  Walking around bushwick late at night observing hooligans?  Truly would like to know 




 Thanks!

 There's very few rookies that came into the NFL and make immediate impact.  On a team that's stacked like ours, why risk mistake/injury?  AJ and LMJ will get on the field sometime this season, but don't expect much.   




 No way we do, and I was a Alex hater up till last year.  I've already accepted the fact Alex is not gonna be the proto typical QB we've been accustomed to.  But Kaep is still a year away easy.  Alex has mastered this playbook already, knows the in's and out's.   




 The train ride over to the stadium was majority Niners.  I was actually a little nervous before kickoff that some guido Jets fan would try to start shit, but there was red jerseys everywhere.  In other words, backup.

 I also think having Ginn's absence makes a big difference in field position.  Especially those extra 5-10 yards on punts/kickoffs for starting field position

 Hey folks, was curious who all was planning on attending the meeting.  Possible Reddit/Hemophilia meetup?   




 I think most of us would love to see that happen, but WCO (west coast offense) is a combo of short timing patterns and power runs which ultimately open up the deep ball.  At the end of the day, I just don't think it's in Alex to chuck it up there.  I for one would love to see a jump ball to Randy Moss.

 [You can prepare chicken in such a way that will kill off disease while leaving the flesh cold and uncooked.  In Japan, this is called toriwasa.

 The [fun](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sR0mrUU9bs) starts at the 2:24 mark.  Again, when your culture has been around for 2000+ years, basics such as produce and livestock are a completely different ball game than here in the US.  The knee jerk reactions are evident as to how naive you view world foods.   




 This is cultural, and perhaps even a difference in physiology.  Being Japanese, it's been in our society for hundreds of years.  Bodies respond differently.  I hear what you're saying, but I didn't even flinch for a second when this was offered.  Perhaps this [article](http://www.facingtherisingsun.com/japan-travel-tips-eating/raw-chicken-sashimi-torisashi-toriwasa) might shed light on this matter.   




 It's totally fresh unlike any kind of product here in the state's.   The chicken was raised local,  and killed that day.  Pretty common to find this stuff  









 Pretty neat to see identical runs against the Packers.  The kid is a straight up gamer, and he's ours!!

 Same thought process.  If Harbs was able get Alex to play above his potential, imagine what he can do with Kaep.

 If we could swing a trade with the chiefs for safety Eric Berry, it would be a win win for both 




 Plus his rotation is terrible.  He's been playing Steph, Klay and Jack all at the same time, a la Nellieball at the end of games.  Sometimes it pays off, but it's starting to become a predictable trend 




 If you have a asian grocery nearby, you can make this at home, its easy and more fun than going to a resto.   




 Are you a fan or a hater?   




 Exactly this.  We've forgiven Alex many times in the past for mistakes, yet the moment Colin makes one he gets crucified.  Let's see how the kid bounces back from this 




 yeah bc monday morning/arm chair qb's such as yourself are guru's when it comes to football.   




 Not only this, let's at least give Kaep a chance to see how he responds to  a loss.  We've given Alex many chances prior, it's only fair to give Colin this same standard.   




 The 2 coaches that I fear are Fisher and Coughlin.

 if you're trying to stir the pot, you succeeded.  i'm calling you out because you have no basis for your post.  can you back up your claim, or are you just giving a opinion?  

no one has to keep moss satisfied, and if you've been reading the papers, moss has been a true veteran.  he's even suggesting plays that aren't designed for him. we're all fans with amateur opinions, but don't bring a useless claim.  what you just stated isn't a legit concern.   




 Come on knock on our door 




 To the Chiefs for Eric Berry would be super nice 




 Not even close dude 




 and your also a fan with a amatuer opinion with no basis whatsoever

 Thanks, it was a year.  I appreciate the answer, if you have any other info please pass it on!

2 years ago in NYC, I was busted for smoking a joint on the street. The court decided to offer an A.C.D (Adjournment of contemplation dismissal) if I didnt get into trouble after a year. My case would then be sealed.

 wow you think of that all by yourself?   i see you always trolling the Kaep supporters, get off it.  We get your love for Alex and all, but you seem to talk this nonense bullshit.  

I said this another thread, whatever happens in the playoffs, whether we go all the way or lose 1st round, don't come around here saying "Told you Kaep sucks, or Alex wouldn't have lost"  bullshit

 The road to the Superbowl goes thru the Giants.  Alex played em 2x, and failed.  I'll give the benefit of the doubt from last years's depleted receiving core, but this year he has weapons.  

If Harb was able to get a player with a low ceiling and get him to max out, how far can he take a player with a much greater potential?  Our coaching staff was so clever and amazing with Alex, just imagine what they have in store for Kaep.  They've been game planning for Kaep, they will put him in situations to succeed.   




 Unknown entity?  Our coaching staff watches and scrutinizes these 2 players everyday for the past 2 years, they know the exact weakness and strengths of both.  Now while Kaep might not have the stats all Alex lovers love to spew, he's opening up the playbook Harbs designed to have.  

I got 5 on it saying we'll see a bomb to Moss in the next few weeks, and we'll see different plays we haven't seen all season because we've had to cater to Alex so much.   




 Whoever is under center from here on out, we support Harbs fully.  This past week there's been tons of shit talking between which QB is better.  I'm guilty of this as well.  

However if we lose in the playoffs, the last thing I want to see on this message board is another QB debate, or fans questioning Harbs choice.  We ride n die as a team, no throwing anyone under the bus.  It's not about, "Alex wouldn't have made that mistake, or Kaep was too young"  I'm done with this rant, let's go Niners.   




 He's a little bitch.  Man up and confront, no need to blast people on FB.   




 This dude is a little bitch.  Man up and confront them in person, he's got video.  It's like he wants the attention on FB 




 Mitsuwa hands down is the best in the greater NY area.   




 Oyster sauce is a must. Depending on the type of stir fry, fish sauce is also handy.  And don't be afraid of a tiny bit of sugar, these are all strong salty.   




 Sorry Kenka is junior varsity.  It's mainly izakaya, and those kind of spots don't focus on noodles.  Their draw is the greasy bar food I.e yakitori, pork belly, fried chicken  




 Not sure what ramen joint you had in Japan, but standard tonkotsu is white milky. My exp at Minca didn't have the look or taste of tonkotsu 




 The only drawback is the bar hopping scene on the east side is bleh.

 You're looking at a 1hr 30-2 hr wait for Ippudo, as well as forking over 17.00 for a bowl.  My wife and I are both fans of Hide-Chan's Hakata Tonkotsu.  It reminds us of ramen joints in Japn 




 Too thick of a broth IMO.  I haven't been to Jin, but have heard good things.  If you haven't had Hide-Chan yet, highly recommend.   




 Redditor for 10 months.  Explains alot.   




 It's not the end, it's a phase.  Explain that from here on out, the decisions she makes is on her.  You did your part, all you can hope for is that she is grateful and can return the favor one day 




 Exactly this, every Alex debate has to have #'s and %s.  Now while that might look sexy to Alexsexuals, we look way more dynamic with kaep.  Even VD raved about how much more zip the ball has when it comes out of kaeps hands.  

Ill give some benefit of the doubt to Alex last year bc of the depleted receiving core, but no excuse for this years giants game.  3 int's, and that's with suped up WR's.  I think our play book was at half max bc we had to cater to Alex.  People forget how dope our coaching staff is that put Alex in situations to succeed.  Guarantee Randy Moss is gonna have 70 yd bomb from Colin soon.   




 So all you guys think Harbs and the staff aren't competent enough to game plan against that?  Because essentially, when you're dissing kaep saying defenses will know how to game plan, we won't be able counter attack.  Please explain 




 And the same argument can be made for Brady, so don't categorize all the time  




 Don't even bother, the Alexsexuals love down voting any mention or praise of kaep.

 I have a hard time believing this type of drug would sell well in NY, especially in Meatpacking.  Most people out here love blow, molly, drugs that cost $. Krokodil is poor man's shit, gives you a dirty high.   




 I'm a minority, been called every name in the book.  Do I give a fuck?  No.  Should you either?  No.  I can't tell you what to do, but if this sort of stuff gets to you then you need to toughen up.  Sorry to put it this way, but your living in "their" neighborhood.  Most of us are temporary residents of NYC, after 5-10 years we leave.  These guys are lifers, they're not going anywhere, so get used to this shit.

 Look I get it, drivers can be ruthless.  I drive everyday in this city and try not to block the box, but when you need to move out of on coming traffic there's not much you can do.  The car in front can move as much as possible, but the Times Sq area is a cluster.  Unless you have driven that area, its almost impossible not to break laws.

 The flip side is most of the people that come to NYC only stay for a few years, maybe 10 tops.  Although there is a constant rotation of in/ out, the native folks get the short end.  

I told this to someone earlier, although I may claim NY as my home, home is really the people that have roots here.  Those folks likely won't be leaving this city, and it's not by choice.  This realization made me become way more tolerant of this city and of the people.  .

 




 This past week, there's been 2 Alex Smith threads.  I wish the mods could regulate this more, it's ridiculous to even mention him this season.   




 Looks like some good yay being passed around 




 B/C there's a bunch of Alex Smith fanboys that are dying to talk shit 




 Sushi of Gari is pretty good 




 Wonder if this is also the Super Bowl hangover 




 It's useless, so many Smith fanboys trolling.   




 shady transactions go down nightly in this city, i really doubt there's a website to bust out people  




 Remember it's a whole season, and my gut tells me there is a whole arsenal of the "O" coming.  We're only on Chapter 1.   




 It's not even like that.  You got a QB out there (Kap) bustin his tail and one of top threads I see is a request for Alex Smith's wins.  That's classless.  Why not put a countdown, for Aldon Smith for single season sack record?  A player that's actually on our team.  

The fact that thread got upvoted is ridiculous.  This summer alone I saw 4 Smith threads, which shows fans aren't over it still.  In fact, 1 Redditor even made the claim, "Alex Smith is still one of us"  
I question the Smith fans. Straight UP.   




 This might not be the best comparison, but this reminds of how Miami used to play New England when the Pats were at their best.  Miami just played them physical and had their # a bunch of times.  I see a similar trend with the Rams as well.  Both the Rams and Hawks will always be a challenge to us.   




 This is a 49ers sub reddit.  If you really feel that it's necessary to put up a ex teammates win column, go make your own sub reddit.  It's classless IMO.  




 I asked this b.c something similar happened to my friend in CA.  We thought he would be able to sue, but the insurance comp advised against it because he wasn't hurt.   




 Poor planning on the restaurants part.  Bad on them for not realizing the type of clientele they were serving.

 So a couple years back I talked to this guy who used to frequent Ibiza alot.  He said in Europe, people roll but never to the point of being on the floor and needing to be taken care of.  He noticed how in America, the young ravers would go overboard with their consumption.

 The farmers that grow it are against it as well.  As much as I'm for legalizing it, it puts a lot of the growers out of work.  There's tons of people up in the Emerald Triangle Nor Cal that have been growing for years.

 This coming Aug, my family has decided to do a Yosemite trip.  My 2 biggest concerns is my 4 y.o nephew, and mom who can walk but not much (1-2 hours tops)

That being said, can people recommend reasonable hikes and places to check out without it being too strenuous.  Also, what are some good hotels within a 45 min drive outside of Yosemite?  It seems as though most are inside (all booked) our they're super far like 1 hr 30 min (Oakhurst, Coarsegold). Is there something in between?   




 Try mixing this with a splash of sesame oil, bunch of green onions, and soy sauce till paste gets to a sauce consistency.  Great for grilling chicken, lettuce wraps, etc

 he's a dumbshit, anyone that tries to flex their IQ and claim they made money of their "football IQ" is a fucking moron.  your response was well written, better than how I would've put it.   




 you ever try soaking the corn in water before grilling?  read somewhere it gets the corn even juicier 




 Couldn't agree more.  There are sushi restaurants that have lost clientele because the chef has left.  It's because the chef had a following, and they were consistent in taste, service, etc.  




 So a quick story to share.  Hanging out in the e. village, and a buddy of mine had to go to BofA to withdraw cash.  This was on a weekday early afternoon.  

Ahead in line were a couple of young grungy looking kids, no big deal.  They leave, and we're up next.  Both kids leave their ATM receipt behind.  Curious me goes and picks up their receipt to peak.  Low and behold both kids savings account was over 400K.  Now I'm not generalizing that all young cats in NY are trust fund kids, but that day confirmed just the ridiculous amount of wealth that people in NY are running around with.   




 Why the fuck are you this board?  Are you a fan?  See it's fans like yourself that post messages above that display zero knowledge of the game.  The fact you're hung up on him thinking he lost us the game shows your a newbie.  GTFO

 Hey guys+gals, the California camp is coming up next week and I'm desperately in need of a costume idea.  The theme we are incorporating this year is Hereo's.  It can be whatever you'd like it to be, but I was hoping to incorporate some kind of hemophilia twist to it.  Any ideas, suggestions?   




 Like to see this guy's opinion on what he thinks are the best bars 




 He's a defensive genius.  Took the hornets and made them a solid defensive team, made the cavs a lot more respectable.  No coincidence the warriors D got way better te last 2 years  




 Next time add some Guiness instead of water.  The bitterness takes the edge of the saltiness, and the alcohol makes the corn beef super tender 




 My dad sometimes will take some strips and will char it over the stove for a few seconds.  Also, some bars will serve with Kewpie Japanese Mayo as a dipping sauce.   




 Blue Owl also has great live jazz on Sundays, as well as awesome hip hop on Thurs.

 La Quinta INN Hotel, in Ktown.  You get a great view of the Empire State, big patio and good priced drinks.  Plus you can get smashed and bomb on some Korean BBQ after.  




 Instead of forking over 20.00 for the Empire, go to La Quita in on West 32nd St Koreatown.  Awesome rooftop bar that sits directly next to the Empire State so you can see pretty well.   




 Upon landing in Oakland, you get welcomed with a nice fat joint.  And then the plane would do a side show on the run way 




 It's a double edged sword with Lee.  In all his years, whenever he's forced to play center, he doesn't do well match up wise and #'s wise.  However, stick a center next to him and he flourishes.  Less pressure off him to perform, plays decent weakside D, and gobbles tons of boards due to the Center boxing out.  I still think you keep him next year, but wouldn't be surprised if we trade mid way next year, especially if we're not doing good as a team 




 yeah it's a weird japanese veggie thing.  my aunt does the same every morning with a salad of some sort.   




 I can go with porridge and fish, but natto has always been too hardcore for me.   




 this team reminds me of how OKC grew up right before our eyes.  they built a team thru a solid draft as well, and had a few tough years in the playoffs before fully blossoming 




 Each time I open these "meals from around the world" it's been totally inaccurate.  Japanese do not eat tofu regularly for breakfast.   




 Oh lemme clarify, an Alex Smith homer.  Are you a fan of this team?  Because the way you criticize Kaep and Harbs, why the fuck are you on this message board?  Stick by team thick and thin..But wait, a newbie such as yourself, you wouldn't know that.  

You display zero knowledge of the game, and it's obvious you can't get enough of Alex's dick.  Wait till week 3 next year when Alexis will be getting booed off the field.  I'll be waiting to hear your excuse then.  "Oh it's because the Chiefs have no O line, he has no weapons"  GTFO kid 




 So in other words, you know more than Harbaugh.  Yeah chew on that 




 Ball don't lie.  Don't be so quick to jump at #'s, they don't mean shit, especially in a game that counts i.e Championship Game (down by 2 TD's) or going into New England and outgunning Tom Brady.  

The fact your still hung up on thinking Kap lost the game shows your pretty blinded and homer.   




 There was a similar story I read a year ago about a chinese guy that kept his dead gf in his apt well after she passed.  He even blogged about it I believe and posted pics.  Her pic was way more disturbing

 im not following your drift. source:japanese as well 




 Good queston.  He trained a little in Japan, then while going to art school in Philly he worked at a few different joints.  But then his art really took off and stopped cooking.  

The last 3 years in NYC whenever he had free time we would get together and have these massive feasts.  His art work is just as amazing, and it shows whenever he makes food.  Inserting shameless plug [here](http://tadashimoriyama.com/) for his work 




 No worries, after 3 shots of whiskey, it dawned on me that aerial view was the way to go.   




 You are spot on about a quality rice cooker.  My wife and I dropped 300.00 on a bad ass rice cooker in Japan.  Granted this thing has tons of functions, (induction heating, slow cooker, porridge, etc) but it was shocking to see how crazy in price these things get.  

On the hother hand, my mother in law is old school and uses a pressure cooker.  Her rice always is perfectly cooked.   




 Store bought unagi, you can find it at the asian market.  Forewarning that there is a major Unagi shortage happening around the world, and the price has skyrocketed.  This past winter in Japan, I paid close to 40 bucks for a unagi bento.  Granted it was wild, and delicious, but still bank 




 Sadly this will be one of my final meals from him, since he's moving cross country.   




 I'll start from the top row, left to right.

Avocado Roll, Octopus nigiri, California Roll, Squid Nigiri

Cucumber Roll 




 One thing I've learned in my years browsing reddit.."never stick your dick in crazy" 









 It's soba noodles, pretty un typical for Japanese.  The rolls however are legit.  Sorry that's all the shots we had 




 Sashimi in the pic= Salmon, Yellowfin Tuna, Hamachi, Tuna tartare with green scallion  

Veggies= Shiso leaf, avocado, cucumber 
























 Sweet n Vicious in the Lower East Side shows games in the back patio.  




 The flow of the game changes when Dray is on the floor.  He's always at the right place at the right time. 




 Kerr is a package deal.  He's only mentioned these days b.c of his relations with Phil.  If Phil were G.M of the Warriors, I'd do in a heartbeat, bc you're getting the Triangle Offense.  Kerr by himself is not as appealing.   




 This will not go away quietly.  What does "forced to sell" actually mean?  All this while he still will get paid, fans will buy tickets and merchandise, and Clippers players will still be associated with this.   




 Feel like there's alot of "what if's"  What if Sterling appeals?  How much does California law come into play here?  Pretty sure Sterling and his team of crony lawyers was expecting this, and how to counter.   




 I cant' help but wonder how tonight's game will play out.  Of course this whole topic is bigger than basketball and life, but if Sterling receives a lifetime ban, I've got a feeling it's going to fuel the Clippers.   




 This feels sorta passive/aggressive on Doc's part.  If Sterling still remains owner after today, why not boycott immediately?  I get that he still has a job to do.  However, by principle and moral obligation, shouldn't you voice your displeasure now, and stop collecting paychecks.   




 I'm curious of all these rumors of assistant coaches not talking to Mjax for weeks at a time.  Malone was reportedly one of them, although he says his relations with Mjax are OK, and now Scal.  

 




 People are bitching b.c its not sounding the way they're used to hearing it, or the way they "want" to hear it.  And then you get a bunch of folks on Reddit that try and pick apart every little fault.   




 I think it's gonna get worse as this drags on.  These players listen to the radio, read the papers, watch ESPN, etc.  Pretty sure their friends and family have already voiced their opinion on this matter making it a  major distraction for them.  


 









 So as Redditors, is this going to be reported?   




 I know this is totally fantasy land thinking, but if Lebron wants the most rings, GS should be close to the top of the list.  He can play point, allowing Steph to be 2 guard, or play the 4 and let Bogut be the middle.  

I can't see too many other teams that could compete with that line up.  It def is a better upgrade than the current Miami squad.   




 wow internet tough guy 









 Really would like to see what a Festus and Draymond duo can do together.     




 And that is why I have full confidence in whatever our front office decides this off season with Mjax.

Also, highly recommend reading his book, "West by West" 




 Always loved Chris Henrys game, if only he stayed away from drama.

 Quit jocking...Brandon rush was 10x the contributor, no love for him?  




 Agreed, basketball is one of the few sports where the better team wins decidedly.  A few years ago, losses like this would have been ok b.c the Dubs were so mediocre.  It's no longer acceptable.  Our roster was is better this year, but our execution was 3x better last year, esp playoffs 




 I think other teams have studied us on film and are prepared for us.   




 He shit in his own bed 




 How is it we hold the bulls to 24% shooting in the 1st quarter, and then the rest of the game they blow up?  Simple, Thibideau made adjustments, mjax didn't  




 Think he's still figuring out his role.  Barnett had a good assessment of Dre during the Pistons game.  I almost think next year he might be better of the bench where he can be 1st option. 




 What's most frustrating is that Klay doesn't drive enough.   Everyone knows he's going to pull from outside, but he seems content jacking up shot after shot.   




 Very excited to see how tonight's game is going to play out, esp with Mark Malone knowing our team so intimately.  It will be a good test for MJax to see if he can out "chess" Malone.

 The other night we were up by 10 with 2:30 to go, and he was still jacking up shots.  Why not kill some clock?   




 Pretty sure the front office is thinking the same thing.   




 Our schedule was pretty brutal compared to past years, and it hurt us especially since we missed out on home field advantage.  It's almost as if all the stars need to be aligned for us to go to the big dance, i.e no injuries, winning the division, etc.  

Remember, we also lost Cully, Ian Williams, B. Miller 




 DAE think a flea flicker would be useful early in the game to keep Seattle's defense honest?  Seattle swarms the ball so much that a little trickery would make them play off balance.  Either way, Roman has to call the game of his life today 




 Pretty sure the front office is keeping a close eye on Bogut's lack of playing time.  If this keeps up, Jackson will be on a shorter leash.  Our window to win a title is small, so all misques by coaches and players are magnified 10x.  Really wouldn't be surprised if Bogut speaks up if he is benched again for no particular reason.   









 He's had more than enough chances to prove his worth and couldn't do it.

 No they're fucking biased 




 Dishes were as follows.  Mixed chicken salad (skin, cartilage , meat)
Beef soup, Scallops with butter, Tuna, Fried chicken cartilage, Broiled salmon collarbone, Braised pork belly, Grilled shrimp.  

 














 Noodles were some of the best ever.  Up till this point, I only liked thin (hoso-men) style noodle, but these bad boys changed my view.  They were chewy, and absorbed the soup real well.  I'll post a noodle pic later on.   




 It tasted like fish powder, but very subtle.  The broth itself had a strong fish base to it as well.  Same restaurant from Mind of Chef David Cheng episode 1

 I know it's Barnes gameplan, but these days he's been making more news  then past years.  Let's not be so quick to judge by a single comment I make of a player.   




 Matt Barnes is becoming a little bitch, always trying to scuffle and get into shit 














 There's times I listen to m Jackson, and it sounds very Singletary-esque.  Lotta cliche quotes with substance, but no real explanation.  I think the loss of mark Malone hurt us more than we thought 




 ESPN has become the TMZ of spots these days.  Just a bunch of satire, and over paid analysts to stir shit up.  Good for Merriman

 Will there be any prosecution to this?  I ask this because a similar topic was brought up in a earlier thread how drivers in the US don't get criminally prosecuted if they kill/hurt a pedestrian accidentally.  Basically, if they didn't see the pedestrian/biker, no fault.

 It's not your problem.  I'm pointing out that your remark regarding getting a education is not an option, it never was, and it's easy for guys like you to throw those opinions out there.  

You can spin this whatever you want, wasn't meant as an attack 




 Riiight says the guy that probably was encouraged to attend college at a early age from parents that most likely went to a 4 yr institution.  

Shit doesn't work like that in most of America, let alone NY.  You'l be lucky if either of his parents have a H.S education.

 I just called the restaurant to find out whether they had fired Dana, but the person on the other line said she could not answer my question.

 Wondering all year why we don't go no huddle more often.  Plus, isn't the first 25 plays supposed to be scripted?   




 Still confused why Jackson didn't put bogut on Randolph from the beginning of the game.  Lee was getting torched every time  




 I for one can't wait for Ezeli to come back, but we desperately need a dependable PG.  Baze played himself out of the rotation tnt with his play.   




 I'm doing a price comparison between StubHub and NFL ticket exchange.  Felt as though StubHub prices were a little higher.  I was wondering how close to face value are the seats on NFL ticket exchange.   




 But do you think Harbaugh is willing to risk his job to be that loyal to Roman?   Things get real dicey if they start losing more games and reporters start questioning the offense.  The Ravens fired their O Coordinator mid season last year which could have totally back fired.       




 I don't get why we don't do no huddle more often.  Isn't the first 25 plays supposed to be scripted. 









 No Keane's or Minetta Tavern?   




 I have a Santoku knife that I bought from Japan that needs repair and sharpening.  It's got a small chip in the blade and I'm hoping there's an experienced craftsmen in the city that could help.   









 You guys have consistently been in the playoffs for the last decade and have a culture of winning.  This year isn't panning out, but there's a trend and it's designed by luck 




 Exactly where did I mention off field issues?  I'm referring to the article, and that contending teams would never conduct a meeting at a strip club.  You're bringing in an entirely different topic.   




 Perhaps because a lot of the players were involved and are now desperately trying to do some damage control 




 Is it no surprise that a mediocre team ala Miami has these problems? When you know going into the season you have no shot at winning the Super Bowl, how does that affect the make up of the team? Teams such as SF, Pats, Steelers are focusing on the championship, and nothing less.

 Well done 
























 Even more annoying was that Harbs and Roman claimed they watered the down the playbook and simplified it this offseason 




 I've driven in many different countries as well as states, and by far the worst drivers (mainly taxi) are here in NY.  My theory is that the majority of this city goes by public transportation, and having access to a car is much harder.  Therefore, not experienced.  

I've also heard native NY'ers claim they wanted a service/driving job in the city (police, etc) b.c they wanted to drive a car.   




 There's also this other guy, he's called Jim Harbaugh, aka as the Head Coach.  But of course, he's never to blame right?  He only sits in every meeting for game planning, has the final call as to what the play calling should be etc.  Yeah Roman and Kaep are the biggest reasons.   




 Posted this in a similar thread:  
If you look at the past 3 seasons, it's been a different team in stark contrasts.
 Year 1, Harbaugh and Roman simplify the playbook and cater to Alex strengths. Remember the genius naked QB bootleg against the Saints in the playoffs? Where has that gone? The offense that year was pretty dismal at times, but we played really disciplined. There were a lot of shits, 2 TE sets, etc. Low scoring affairs, but the D was monster that year.

Year 2, we unleash Colin and the read option. Now the O is passing down the field more often, letting Colin run wild. In all the midst of it, the play calling changed and started to see more delay of games, weird run calls, etc. Let's not forget the last play of the Super Bowl.

Year 3. In the off season, both Harbs and Roman both agreed to clean and simplify the calls and terminology. What happened to our 2TE sets, or jumbo package for ground and pound?  How come Kap still throws 90+ mph fastballs to his receivers only a few feet away?  All these what and why ?s 




 It kills me when he throws a bullet to a WR 4 yards away.   




 Nah ignorance will supersede that 




 The way the offense has looked, we're not deserving of a SuperBowl.  This may sound weird, but I'd rather not make playoffs, so that in the offseason we clean up the roster and revise the playbook.  




 If this were to happen, there needs to be strict guidelines.  For instance, if the the officer tried to take off or disconnect the camera deliberately, their ass is fired.  

If I were a honest cop, why wouldn't you want a body camera? 




 Reggie Miller made a living out kicking his leg out.  Lin's fadeway wasn't even close to the same kick leg as Reggies 




 Is there a specific # of years thats determined for all this?  Curious bc of similar incidents such as Penn State Jerry Sandusky, or the sexual abuse from the Catholic Churches.  Those events happened many years ago but the perpetrators were still prosecuted  




 It's incredible how many ally oops we've had this season compare to last 




 Can't tell, but did you keep the head on?   




 I got to watch S Dot a lot last year living in NY.  The thing I loved the most is the height advantage he has over most PG's.  His ability to post up and defend smaller guards really creates mismatches.  Give him a few more weeks and you will see exactly why Dubs picked him up.   




 Which last time I checked, dancing naked was illegal and people have been arrested for it.  Why this guy want charged is straight up baffling 




 I'm sorry, am I the only one that finds it wrong he wasn't charged?  Just bc you lose your shit doesn't mean you can parade in public naked making a scene.   




 Just wondering, but can the same be applied to the bicyclist that hit and killed the woman in Central Park?

Although we're getting better at delay of games, it's night and day when you compare how the offense has looked.  I've never seen a team change identity so quickly.  To answer your question, yes I believe Roman is the problem.   




 And the person prior to that copied as well.  These are moves that have been around forever.  MJ crafted his own style from it.   




 Down to tail gate and pre party!  I'll be taking the train in with a buddy of mine.   




 Lynch is still learning schemes is primarily used on pass rushing downs.  Once Aldon comes back it'll be interesting to see what packages they will be using 




 When Livingston is running the 2nd unit, he'll be expected to distribute and be a pass first PG.   




 It's more like a 3 year window.  Look at OKC a few years back and that should tell you how quickly things change in the league.

 On a similar note, Chinese food in Japan is pretty awesome.  Dishes like mabo tofu and tan tan men are good examples of that  




 Almost every time these "foods around the world, breakfast from every country" album pops up, they're entirely inaccurate.  Plus, I've never seen okonomiyaki look like the one posted in the pic.

 His TD pass to Boldin against St.Louis was very Brett Farve like 




 How's the toe AJ?   




 He most certainly has looked more comfortable in the pocket.  His TD throw to Boldin was very Bret Farve like 




 Or go animal fries 




 But he also can wear out the other "4" because of his quickness.  I'm surprised they never tried a Steph, Klay, AI, Barnes, Bogut lineup 




 Kaep looked a little like Bret Farve on that TD throw to Boldin 




 Bogut didn't play in FIBA this year. I do think it raised Klay's confidence a little, but he's been working on his game all summer regardless of FIBA 




 Yup, certain sec at the Stick were regulated hardcore.  They knew the usher's name and would yell at the front row fans to always sit down.   




 NYC 




 I don't think its cocky.  It's his shot selection which I'm surprised more people don't mention about.  There's times he"ll pull up a fadeaway 3 with 2 defenders in his face.  
 




 And, no team had signed him so he's extra salty 




 Its bc a lot of these "fans" feel as though Harbaugh did the wrong thing by benching Alex Smith in favor of Kap.  Lotta salt from that wound 




 Must be a slow news day for Monte pool 




 There's times the 49ers resemble a college team based on their formations and shifting.  It's really predictable at times 




 007-373-5963 




 Other than Justin Smith's sack, the pass rush wasn't that impressive.  Similar to the Dallas game, it seemed as though we barely got to the QB.  Is this all because we're missing Aldon, or something else?     




 Why were soo pass happy?  Not just that, but the receivers were running long routes, 15+ patterns?   




 Anyone ever mistake you for [ronlivingston?](http://filmnewreleases.blogspot.com/2011/04/ron-livingston-in-game-change.html) 









 This wasn't my personal recollection, but I remember someone telling a story about this on  this subreddit.  

Soon after the first tower was hit, people living in BK began walking on the BK bridge to get home.  There were hundreds of people all in a frenzy.  In the midst of all the chaos stood a huge motorycyle cop, shirt burned and halfway torn off.  He had swastikas and other crazy tats all over his body.    But what struck me was the tears streaming down his face as he was  guiding traffic.  

 




 That's the black stallion 




 The owners need to band together and make a statement.  That might get the ball rolling, but it's hard to imagine Goodell stepping down from all this.  NFL is in major damage control right now, and will try everything in it's power to make themselves look competent 




 Boomer is borderline awkward when he tries to force his hand on topics.  His morning show is even worse 




 With the NFL having to play damage control, I can't help but think Goodell will try and bring down the hammer regardless of the verdict pertaining to Ray McDonald.  It's the leagues way of compensating for the screw up.  Thought's, Concern's, Gripes?  Fire away 




 His book, "West by West" was a fun read.  Gives insight about his competitiveness and how he handled it.   




 And that's part of my issue with all this.  In my opinion, it's borderline disrespectful.  How so?  You got Kap busting his tail everyday, trying to do all he can in his power to carry the team to the Super Bowl.  

And then you have a post about how happy some fans are that Alex Smith got a contract extension.  With the season starting in less than 4 hours, all focus should be on this team now, and how we're going to try and win another trophy.  Not a discussion on a QB that's no longer on a team that put up mediocre #'s.   




 Well if people stop posting of players not currently on the roster, then we can move on.  Of course there's a divide, and some fans still insist Alex was such a great player.  However all these Alex posts contribute nothing but debates and a big circle jerk.   




 Plus fuck ESPN

 Do you happen to know where your friend picked up that yakitori grill?   




 It was tasty, and if you've ever had Japanese Italian, the flavors were pretty spot on.  The cheese went really well with the noodles, and the sauce wasn't too tart either.  It wasn't heavy either

 Exactly the right term, dink and dunk.  He can't complete a 20 yard out pattern to his WRs.  Either he gets too spooked in the pocket and does a check down, or doesnt have faith in his arm 




 This stuff goes well with grilled chicken 




 The post season really showed just how ineffective Lee was at times.  Granted bogut was out, but Lee looked absolutely spooked.  

Each round in the playoffs gets more intense, and there's just no way lee could handle the likes of Duncan, Ibaka, etc.

 When Scarlett Johansson nude shots were leaked, never seen so many redditors be kind to each other  




 Klay needs to take a good hard look at what's around him and then decide what he needs to do.  He keeps saying he would like to play for GS, he's gonna need to take a discount in order to keep other players.  If money is the deciding factor, then he's better off somewhere else.  I.E. Ducan and Novitzki taking pay cuts in order to keep the team together 









 Funny how people balk on the idea of B Davis, but would consider signing Basemore in a heart beat.  A washed up Baron is still way more valuable than a back up cheerleader 














 Because he's anti-49er, and as a commentator he should be neutral.  His voice is also monotone 




 The guy sleeping might have slept horizontally on the subway seat which is a automatic fine in NYC subways.  It's a shit rule, but I've seen many people get tagged because of this.  This is the only thing I could think of as to why NYPD would harass him 




 No thanks, we need all bench room possible.  I would rather take the time to develop Nedo and another back up PG/SG than use it on Base.   




 The ones in Japan are insane. Induction heating, ceramic bowls are just a few of the perks.  Im too embarrassed to say how much we dropped on ours 




 Golden state please step up to the mic 




 Curry, Klay, Iguodola, Lebron, Bogut would be filthy.  




 Pft is satire journalism 




 You're talon me 




 Feel like this is Spoelstra taking the fall and sticking up for his franchise player.  What else can he really say?  "Oh Lebron is a wuss, I'm disappointed" 




 Ugh...didn't V.D learn the first time, it's all about the team?   




 More than just a extension.  It's a statement to the rest of the league.  Were betting the house this year or next year 




 Damn her Twitter is just as [bad](https://twitter.com/JanelleAmbrosia) 




 My own take on this, and from what I observed living in not so great areas, i.e West Oakland and Riverside County.  When it gets hot, people like to drink more, that's a given.  

I noticed the liquor stores got busier, and the prices of 40 oz's dropped a little.  It's a cycle that doesn't stop.  People get drunk, sometimes get more irritable bc of the heat, drink more because their irritable, etc.  

Then you mix that with violence, and with school being out kids being bored, and it's a perfect recipe for crime.  I have no stats on this, just personal observation, but it's a theme that occurs every summer.  And chances are, the hotter it gets, more violence.   




 Looks awesome.  For tender asparagus, try peeling the bottom half of the stems.  Theres so much fiber around there it gets tough and chewy

 You're reaching with these points.  These guys are pros, and if you think a TV commentator is a distraction during practice, then they shouldn't be playing during crunch time in a playoff game 




 Perfect, just what Reddit needs.
More idiotic and ignorant posts 




 where on this post was it noted that I didn't credit the F.O?  With all these moves being made, and the F.O trying to win a championship, if these moves end up being disastrous, who gets the blame?  That was the message of this post 

You can claim we had the best starting line up, which is arguable.  I don't think we do, nor do we have a championship roster at this moment.  

As for "Cry Monta" Is that supposed to mean something?   




 With GS being in the news spotlight and all, we are now under more scrutiny than ever before.  One thing I'm curious about is the "blame game"  that might happen if we don't win, or exceed expectations.  

For instance, we had a bad bench and blame can be put on Myers and company for providing Mjax with such a shitty 2nd group.  I will give Myers some credit for the trade of Steve Blake.  However, we went into the season with Toney Douglas as the back up PG.  Did he really think that was going to work?  

So the question is, at what point is it more a personnel issue (meaning players and how they're utilized) and a coach issue?  I'm expecting us to make major roster moves this summer, and if the trade doesn't work in our favor, who gets the blame?  I guess my point is, how many freebies does Myers and West get?  Is Lacob so blinded and so awe struck by his F.O that he won't hold them accountable?   




 Don't forget the 5 man substitution patterns 




 As credible as Yahoo's Woj is, this one seems far fetched.  Why would Warriors personnel reveal something like that to media?  It would work against their favor, and we've typically been very quiet to reporters

Edit- Nevermind, SVG wanted full Baksetball Operations as well.  No Dice there 




 That article was border line awful.  -"According to non-management sources"  WTF does that even mean?   




 http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/10894198/golden-state-warriors-contact-steve-kerr-coaching-vacancy 




 If SVG can get Harrison Barnes to do [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21cE2aUbWB0), I'm all in! 




 He called out Draymond Green in the playoffs last year, also called out Iggy.  You really want to consider him a coach, let alone piss off the players even more when they hear Karl could be a candidate?  No thanks  




 This F.O's message is to win now, not later.  I'm fine with that, and that message has been consistent throughout it all.  I want to see the same high standard held to the players, I.E Klay accountable for his poor shot selection, Steph with multiple turn overs, Lee and his lack of defense.  

I guess what I'm saying is that if the F.O is this serious, expect some major moves this summer to push the chips all in.   
























 No Ragrets! 




 It's funny, back in the "dark" days we were irrelevant, Fitz wasn't so bad.  Maybe it was b.c there wasn't much to cheer about, but I don't remember getting annoyed since I didn't mind listening to him on KNBR.  But slowly as we got better Fitz began to change as well, more so on the radio.  He would actually berate callers if fans criticized the Warriors management, etc.  

Now when you turn the game on, Fitz is unbearable.  He's such a homer at the most obvious times, and his stubborn insistence of using "Human Torch" has worn thin 




 CP3 and his flopping ass.  He's always getting tangled up and then throws his hands up in the air when a foul gets called against him.  

Right behind CP3 is Blake Griffin and his flopping ass.  Someone that big always on the ground?  And then tries to pull the tough guy act?  Fuck those 2 




 17 y.o can't calm shit 




 Similar happening but on a bus tour.  My wife and her friend did a bus tour from NYC-New Orleans (3 day ride).  The bathroom on the bus was not working because it was a old bus.  A huge sign was on the door that clearly stated not to use the bathroom either.  

Clearly, the sign didn't matter as the passengers (mostly Chinese) all used the toilet.  About 2 hours into the ride and the entire bus smells like a septic tank.  Literally the entire bus smelled like shit and none of the Chinese passengers seemed to mind.  It was still day 1 of the trip 




 You hit it on the mark re "look out for yourself".  Buddy of mine who used to live in China said it's because of the way communism works over there.  Literally every single person is looking out for themselves only, and loses complete disregard for others.   




 You know it's bad when they have [signs](http://www.businessinsider.com/china-is-embarrassed-by-its-tourists-2013-5) at the Louvre in Chinese 









 Along the same lines, but there's gotta be some correlation between fast food and aggression  




 Dahntay Jones don't play, what's he doing in the picture?   




 Born in 77 as well, and was definitely spoiled growing up.  I remember times if the 49er's weren't up by more than 3 TD's that I would start panicking.  Especially the '95 team which was so fun to watch.  You just don't realize how good you have it til you see the same team go downhill.   




 Fitz a legend?   




 I'm feline it 




 Wallace never struck me as a "team" guy, and there's been reports he gives up on plays.  Plus he doesn't block well in the run game 




 Young's 1 on 1 play wouldn't jive with a lot of playoff teams.  No way in hell teams like the Warriors would let him disrupt chemistry by him jacking up 3ptr and 3ptr.  In fact, there's probably a reason teams weren't pushing harder before the trade deadline 




 I'm Asian, I don't sound like that 




 It also depends on what you're doing before/after games.  Grande Hyatt is nice, but not much going on late late night.  The weekends are even worse.  

If you're going strictly for the games, I'd suggest downtown Oakland.  The hotels won't be as nice, but you can get to OCO in 20 min or less.  And these days , the bar and restaurants are solid on Broadway.  




 I'm Asian, and I don't sound like that  









 Tasmanian devil for sure.   




 Exactly why when child and sex abuse cases come up, you try and not have the child repeat their story multiple times.  Each time it could change slightly, especially if they have to testify 




 This is kinda creepy, but I sat a few rows behind you guys!  Sec 103?  I was chuckling to myself when I saw the Vo jersey.  Way to represent the bay, there were hella Dubs fans.  The best was when the crowd started to chant "MVP" when Curry was at the line 









 Purely speculation, but Harbs refusing to bench Aldon and Ray Mac after their arrests played a part.  Our window to win the Super Bowl is 2 years max, and it would be risky to keep the staff intact and gamble another season.   




 I'd bring up the fact that the Warriors were awful for the longest period of time.  We were the laughing stock of the league, but the fans were still so loyal.  That should get a conversation going.  

Another topic I like to bring up at sports bars is the excitement Curry brings to the NBA.  The last time I felt as though a player could dominate a game was MJ/Kobe.  There's times when everyone stops what they're doing and just watches Curry drop 3's from downtown.  The last player to capture that kind of excitement was Jordan.  And please, this is not an comparison of players.  Just a comparison of how dominating and exciting these 2 players are 




 I wish they could do a study on the effects of Fast Food and Anger.  There has to be some kind of correlation and how it affects the brain.   




 True, I think there is just more of it theae days due to reddits popularity.   




 It's bc the demographic of Reddit has changed in the recent years.  This place used to have great content with real conversation.  

Now you got a bunch of young H.S and college kids that like to troll and post crap comments.

Remember a few weeks ago, there was a pic of a guy dying of cancer that posted a pic of his wedding day?  Some redditors joked about his baldness, others made fun of his fiance.  Truly tasteless 




 BC there's a lot of teenagers on this sub.  Once he got the swaggy nickname, he became this icon around here.  Pointless and stupid  




 I think this is similar to sports analytics which many teams in basketball use.  There's a ton of metrics and spreadsheets that essentially gives you data such as best spot for jump shots, running certain plays, etc. 

This stuff is used a lot esp since its devised from programmers in Silicon Valley.  

My guess is that the F.O is huge on this formula with Marathe heading it 




 I'm waiting for the sequal, Whore 2.   




 It wouldn't be this bad if the F.O had a actual plan in place.  Watching everything unfold, it looks as though they're grasping at straws.  

We went from proven leader and success to somewhat unproven (Tomsula's 100% win percentage is too small a margin)

Put it this way, the Seahawks game last week was unbelievable.  Special teams did some amazing shit, and the play calls were remarkable.  You think we can match that kind of wits right now with that staff?  
 




 Wouldn't go as far as troll account, that's giving him too much credit.  I like the term "Internet Tough Guy"

"Hey!  Look at me, I found Reddit and now I'm talking shit and feel like such a strong man"  beating chest and cock together simultaneously  




 Was thinking Mangina 




 I meant in terms of the dislike the teams have for each other 




 This year our rivalry is with Houston.  The clippers are an after thought  




 I bet he's a blast at parties 




 I'll take it one notch further.  Reddit is about pics and discussion.  But at what point is the line drawn where stock photos are posted without credit, or posting of pics without any explanation of where it originated?  

This sub in the past was real food from real people.  Now all I see is a glamour shot and a title that screams "strawberry filled  strawberry cheesecake!!!"

Mind you that post I was referring to had its water mark cropped out  




 [Here](http://badblooddocumentary.com/) is a informative documentary that details what went on  




 You gotta wonder if this all the handpicking done by Balke.  I really doubt Tomsula wants it this way.  But again, this is part of being a "yes" coach to the F.O.  Tomsula will agree to it b.c he wants his shot as a Head Coach 




 Can you explain how this is considered fast food?   




 I do sound like that "guy".  Even the other day I told my wife by how shitty music had gotten.

But this pic is different, with a person dying,  enjoying whatever time they had left.  

Leave it to the punk ass to bring their own agenda.  The jk wasn't even funny.  Reddit 4 years ago is way different than today.  There were trolls and such, but much more worse now 




 They have an in house patisserie, all she does is bake bread.  And the butter from France along with salt was incredible.  

Again, never thought I would rave about such simple foods, it was unbelievable 




 If you're able to create+ taste what was posted, you could work at any restaurant in NYC or in the world.  

The chefs that work at Eleven Madison usually go onto opening their own restaurants and those joints become well known.  

I get that a carrot seems so simple.  Having lived in different countries, I realized how much better produce is compared to the US.  

Perfect example?  Chicken sashimi in Japan.  Unheard of here right?  But what if the chicken was killed that morning by a person that specializes in certain breeds and its been handled for generations.  It tasted so clean, I had nothing to worry about. 

My point is, the food that you're used to, depending on where your from isnt comparable to what your seeing in this post 




 You wonder why reddit goes to shit these days?  Posts such as the one above.  Good job kiddo, you've discovered the Internet and now you have chance to act funny and hide behind a screen bc you'll never do in "real" life 




 You couldn't have post this at a better time.  There's a divide in this sub, and it's clear what makes front page and what doesn't.

Shooter sandwich, In and Out, charcuterie and cheese are all front page click bait.  Funny thing is, some of the pics are stock photos!  Some go even as far as cropping out the watermark.


What I'm trying to get at is, there's the older reddit population (30+) and younger generation and its evident when you read some of the comments in here.    




 You could do that at your house, but I'm pretty certain you won't be close to duplicating the same flavors  




 I used to think that was the case at these restaurants, but when my wife and I went to a 3 star, we almost had to be carried out. 

The dessert section alone was 4 courses and they let us take it home bc we couldn't finish it.   




 My wife and I went to jean gorges for our 1 yr.  Some of the dishes looked similar.  And I agree, the bread and butter was the best ever.  My wife even snuck extra pieces in her purse.   




 It's funny how every laker fan was bashing D'antoni, but looking back now, lots of folks would do anything to have him back 




 I like to lurk in r/Lakers sub every so often to read the absurd posts.  It's so cringe worthy.  Stuff like, can we trade for Anthony Davis?  Or let's trade Nash, Lin, and some draft picks for a super star.  

 




 I see the Xs and Os as Pop, and the mental aspect as Phil Jackson  




 Our window for "successful" is extremely small, maybe 2-3 years tops.  And as much as everyone has been praising our Defense, we lost McDonald and possibly Justin Smith.  That's 2 seasoned veterans gone right there.  

I'm optimistic, but very very cautious as to this year's draft.  The 2012 draft that Balke whiffed on can bite us in the ass down the road as well 




 Uhhh OK. Id much rather watch a old guy on TV than a pretty chick.  




 I'm throwing this out there.... There's a good chunk of Alex Smith fans that are still salty.  

There's also a good portion of folks that don't know shit about football in general, I.e possibly bandwagon, possibly generation gap, who knows.  But the posts on here are showing exactly that.   




 STEVE YOUNG HAS ONE RING FOOL

Congrats.  You done fucked up now.  You managed to "out" yourself as a fan that doesn't know shit about your own team.  

I was wondering these days the types of "fans" we had on r/49ers.  There's a huge divide in here and you just exposed it.  




 




 What's in your tare mixture? 




 So far what I love the best is that Steve Kerr is playing rookies and not afraid to put them in the lineup. Just like the spurs, gsw is going to be able to develop talent for the long run 




 Hey look, I can find pics on [pinterest](http://www.pinterest.com/pin/1688918586070362/) too and act like I made it or ate it!  Why not give credit where credit is due?  




 Source? 




 Please post a source.   




 Don't feed him, he's secretly a Clippers fan 




 what did you miss about him?  And if he were to be on the roster today, which player would you replace him with?  I get that he was a great teammate, but man it's comical he's even mentioned this year especially with us being title contenders  




 Be right back, heading to the gas station to pick up a burrito 




 It's b.c OP took this pic and claimed at as his.  This person has literally stolen dozens of other people's work and claimed as their own 




 I posted an answer similar to yours when the charcuterie incident went down.  

20 year old me would have posted burger and pizza pics all day 

Late 30s me is all about a home cooked meal I.e oxtail stew; handmade pasta, etc.   









 I love food, and everything about it, and I'm also a purist, which some could label as snobby.  But if I see a post that is inaccurate, or a stock photo, or people using words for click bait, I'll try and educate without being a dick.  Maybe it's b.c of my Japanese upbringing, who knows.  

But I assure you that this sub a few years ago had awesome content, all of it being genuine.  And I felt as though today was finally the day to bring this up as a conversation piece 




 You couldn't have replied this at a better time.  There's a healthy debate going on as I type this about this exact sort of B.S.   




 Thank you for doing that b.c OP hasn't posted a single recipe for any of the other posts.  The link that was provided which was quickly deleted was of the recipe you had mentioned.  
 




 Surprise surprise...look at the other posts submitted from OP.  3 other posts, no recipe.  Again, I'm not trying to bust people out, or be a dick, but this sub was a legit with "real" food from "real" people.  

 




 Last 30 days I haven't posted any food pics.  Feel free to see what I've submitted in the past.   




 That's pretty spot on.  A few years ago r/askreddit was starting to change with clickbait questions and unnecessary info before the question was asked.  The mods quickly enforced the rules and it got much better.    




 Top posts that usually make it are:

In and Out

Sushi drizzled with sauces

Charcuturie Plates

Shooter Sandwich

 




 I'm all for that, but I'm also seeing stock photos being re used from time to time.  There was a request awhile back where if you posted food pics from an establishment, it was necessary to add the name and location.  

 




 Serious question here.  This sub used to have quality posts of food pics that were amazing.  These days, it's taken a nose dive.  Case in point, the infamous charcuturie pic that was voted #1 for days.  Or today for instance, OP posting a burger claiming it to be Kobe.  

What's upsetting is that when you take the time to scroll down, there's actually some really solid, authentic cooking.  I'm done with my rant, please feel free to agree/disagree on this, or add suggestions as to how to improve this sub.   




 I'm betting most of those cases in the NYC courts are mary jane related 




 kid n play would like to have a word with you  




 I would put izakaya in the same class as tapas.  Small dishes to share that go well with drinks.   














 Sounds like the John Madden of football 




 Daring to go out on a limb here and risk the divide, but I think the demographics of r/49ers goes something like this:  Old timer fans, and New Generation fans

Early days fan born late 70's-early 80's= Fortunate to witness multiple Super Bowls, Joe Montana, etc...I myself was lucky to see this.  

Newer Gen Fans= Abysmal years Nolan, Singletary, etc..Then its Harbs and Kaep and we got ourselves a new team, new identity.  

I'm not dogging either one, but you can tell the discrepancy when reading posts and pics, comments, whatever.  But you did bring up a very good point, which is football discussions are very hard to relate in this sub.  I believe it's the generation divide amongst the fan base.  




 




 Defensive end all the way.  Our pass rush was nothing like the 2012 season.  And now that we lost McDonald and most likely Cowboy, we have some holes 




 The year Baltimore won it all, John Harbaugh fired his O.C midseason.  Unheard of, and ballsy, but it was the move that put them over the top.  Keep in mind, the O.C Cam Cameron was Harbaugh's close friend.  

Now flip the script and look at Jim.  He's loyal to a fault, which most likely cost him his job.  He should have been held accountable and I wouldn't to waste/risk next year retaining Jim and watching the same anemic offense we have for the past 2 years.  

his is the difference maker between the 2 brothers.  Jim is rowdy, ra-ra-ra, and loya, John is on the sidelines, composed and calm but rational.  There's some eerie similarities between SF+Baltimore, but the Ravens are coached way more efficiently with far less talent that SF.  
 
 




 Holmgren has a better approach and balance IMO.  He did more with less in Green Bay than Shanny did in Denver.  It's easy for me to say this now, but having Elway and T Davis is a formidable 1-2 compared to what Farve had in Green Bay.   




 Purely speculation, but my guess is bc Holmgren likes to have full control of football operations, which we all know Trent ain't gonna give up.  Curious as to why they were interested in Shanny since he usually is bith GM/Head Coach 




 This year I didn't know which 49er team would show up playing.  Sometimes they were run dominant, and other times they did spread offense which looked like dogshit.

Last year they were unpredictable at times, maybe bc of Crabtree.  I just wish they played like they did on the road in New England in 2012.  Moss and Crabs were balling out that game 


 




 Just curious but how much time does he interact with the F.O?  A daily basis, once in awhile?   




 Him and Fangio were assistants back in Baltimore during their hay days.  No doubt the guy knows defense.  Thoughts? 




 Wow before this, I never looked at Balke as a condescending person, but now it's a whole different light.  

Also, how the fuck can they say that they are looking for "teachers?"  Harbs was the best teacher 




 I remember reading an article when Harbuagh was first hired that he was excited to have access to hours and hours of Bill Walsh videos.  There was nothing this year that was remotely even close to WCO.  No slant patterns, no play action for deep passes, etc..

Was it because of a lack of speed receivers?  I'd like to hear thoughts 




 You know in the back of my head, I'm hoping that he leaves Mich early, and re signs with us.  Then at the press conference, Jed stands up and apologizes on camera and they both hug.  Camera angle then focuses on Balke standing in the back of the room, clapping slowly (80's movie reference)  and all will be restored in 49er land 




 We gotta get AD up on reddit 




 I wanna add that in DC, Shanahan hired his son as the coordinator and was very unprepared.   




 Yeah really, Cutler is way better.  So good, that he could beat the Pack in Green Bay in the dead of winter.  Or come from behind and beat Atl on the road.  Or set a playoff record for rushing yards by a Qb.   




 The Spurs play team ball to the ultimate degree.  Duncan doesn't give a shit about scoring, or how many touches he gets a game  




 Piggybacking off this, but what happened to our acclaimed West Coast offense?  I remember when harbaugh was hired early on, he said he had access to hours of bil Walsh videos of him breaking down offense.

There was nothing this year that looked remotely anything close to WCO.  No quick slants, no play action for bombs, timing patterns, etc.

It's as if he was trying to use his Stanford play book and tweak it to accommodate Kap. 




 We need someone proven, Holmgren, bill Cowher.   




 But how does letting jim go make the FO more comfortable?  The heat is on them moving forward.  Finding a new coach, having to answer to the relentless media is gonna be taxing.

 




 The niners FO is ran differently than the majority of nfl franchises.   Look at Dallas and the iron fist of jerry jones.  Cowboy fans are waiting for him to croak so they can start fresh.  

Or how about Cleveland and they're worthless owner who has a trigger finger for firing coaches.   

We have a win now mentality, and our window is closing quickly.  Again, I really don't think Jed and Trent are that petty and sensitive that they're letting jim go simply bc they dislike him.  

We're taking a humongous gamble here, but seeing how progressive we've been in literally every other business scenario, I'm at peace with this.   I for one can't stomach another dismal offense, and waste another year which it sounds like was going to happen since jim refused to let roman go 




 I want to give the FO the benefit of the doubt here.  Although we will never truly know the full story, harbaugh must have pissed the FO enough times for them to be fed up with it.  

It's not like there letting him go on a whim.  The FO knows how valuable he is/was.  They're not stupid, the fit isn't there anymore .  All I'm hoping for is that they have a legit candidate in mind.  One that is proven, I.e Holmgren, maybe Cowher.    




 And that's why it was comical seeing him taunt his own teammates last week in practice.  I get it that he's trying to push em and make em tough, but the whole "charmin" comparison and tough guy approach is cring worthy.  


 




 Without being judgemental in age, you can see the divide in generation gaps in r/food.  20 y.o old me would have post a burger or pizza and be completely thrilled.  

Not that those kind of foods are bad, but now that I'm in my late 30s, taking the time to enjoy a meal I.e oxtail stew, or risotto, hand made pastas are much more satisfying  




 You can tell the meat was taken straight out of a package, not even sliced from a real market.  I wanted to give props to the cheese, but again some basic grocery market shit.

Thing is, pretty sure if OP took the time, he/she prob could have found a legit cheese monger 




 Why does everyone assume fangio would consider the hc position?  He's been with Harbs for the last 2 gigs.  He's gone if Harbs is gone  




 No point trying to explain football to a newbie.   




 Rght and the inability to throw down the field is the OCs fault as well.  If Alex fanboys such as yourself keep spitting out the same excuse of switching coordinators, this argument has to wait for 5 more years till Kaep has had a few more years under his belt 




 So you did see the stat that a Chiefs WR hasn't scored a TD in a year?  Let that settle in for a second  




 I'm with you re Balke, and although he has made many good picks, the person prior to him is worthy of mention.  

Scott Mclouglin was the G.M before while Balke was the understudy.  Most folks jump to praise Balke, but let's not forget how who the person was before.  
And no surprise, after Sf fired Mcloughlin, Seattle hired him for a quick second.  




 What round do we take a QB?   




 This was the 2nd time same officer Daniel Pantaleo deployed a illegal choke hold.  I'm not sure how much bearing this had in the indictment, (obviously none) but you would think that the jury would weigh his past offense heavily.   




 The 2007 playoff series vs the Mavs felt like that.  I swear at one point, Oracle felt as if it were shaking

 Learn to make your FT's, and stop pretending you're a 3 PT shooter.  Then you can start talking about winning.   




 This is just my guess, but I think it's b.c school is out now.  Ignorant, immature kids are bored, and have more time to be online.  




 Cheers thanks 




 I'm hoping for some guidance on some books/courses that can steer me in the right direction for a Product Manager gig in the Pharma industry.  My background is in pharma sales, and I'm trying to get into the marketing aspect.  One of the requirements in Affiliate Implementation.  I know this might be a shot in the dark, but if anyone has idea, please share.  Thank you 




 Plus the line in the beginning saying no clinician wanted to see him.   Gimme a break, doctors wanna get paid just like anyone else.    




 I usually sear after sous vide.   




 Hey Hey!!!  Jokes aside, recipe please?   




 Was wondering if there's any books to learn on affiliate marketing, especially within pharma.   




 Try explaining that to others in your sub. Gone are the days where you have to be in LA/NY.  You can film a commercial anywhere these days 




 [HAHA](http://nelson-haha.api-meal.eu/) 




 That's funny bc laker fans weren't using that excuse when they first signed GP and Malone.  My point is Kobe has had help in the past and still lost in the Finals 




 Did you forget the 2004 team?  Kobe had 3 other HOFers and couldn't get it done.  




 If your still hung up on trying to trade Kaep, or conjure up a trade scenario, you might wanna reassess your fanhood.

 That's why I have hard time believing r\food posts anymore.  And, this isnt legit yakiaoba.  Never seen ketchup used as a sauce 




 It's b.c school is out now.  Combine that with boredom and you get a shit show. It's been happening more and more every year 




 Kelly Dwyer is the worst 




 He sounded like a 5 year old many times during the post game conferences.   




 Way to bounce back Festus, and contribute big time in the Final game.   




 At no point did your comment make any sense.  Easy triple double?  Best oxymoron ever 




 The entire team is a bunch of outcasts.  Dray getting drafted in the 2nd, Bogut and his multiple injuries, Steph being too small.   




 Fuck yeah!!!!!!! 




 You're comparing a tweet to a post game press conference.   Literally millions of people are watching this.  This particular answer mad him sound whiny  




 It's called being a pro and and answering questions professionally.   




 Sounds like my 5 y.o nephew.   




 I saw one wearing the traditional garb, but wearing a Mets hat.   




 Recipe please 




 I have a hard time understanding your logic.  Your list has only 1 mention of kap. The rest of your list has to do with a new O line, weak secondary. 




 Yesterday's game reminded me game 2 vs Memphis.  We got flustered, and panicked a bit on shot selection.   









 It shows just how badly we was dinged up last year.  He had a bum shoulder as well that probably wasn't healing the way it wanted.   




 La Quinta inn K town.  Spectacular view of the Empire State and delicious Korean food all around you  




 No way, but I did live in Alameda so my commute was literally 10 minutes.  Although they sucked really bad those days, it was still really fun to go to games.  

Back then you could by a upper level ticket, wait till the 3rd quarter when it was a blowout, sneak down to lower level and watch the games.  The closest I snuck down was right behind the bench.   




 Great question.  When GS was shitty during the 2000's, there weren't really SF Warrior fans.  There was a handful that would make the commute, but for the most part, the crowd was East Bay.  

Fast forward to present day, the crowd these days is way more SF.  Also because ticket prices have increased.   




 One of the papers commented that this is one of the most expensive finals to date.  Whenever you have Lebron tix are going to go up.  




 Love this kids logic.  Has no f'n clue about Steve Kerr's dad, yet will argue as to who killed him.   




 Just wondering what's everyone thoughts are 




 I've heard splash daddy used for Kerr in the Warriors sub before 




 That post was entertaining, there was so much drama that day. Didnt the model from the actual photo show up and tried to ask for royalties? 




 Can we ask the mods to shadow ban? 




 He's posting on redsox quite a bit as well.  Even r/redsox is telling him to delete his account 




 I won't tell you to kill yourself, but I'll tell you to fuck off.  What are you still doing in this sub?  

And for y'all that think that's rude.. I'll tell you why it's not.  Some of the subreddits have changed in the past few years bc of lies and false posts.  Look at r/food for instance.  All u see these days is stock photos with watermarks cropped out, and people claiming they actually made it.  

The warriors sub has always been legit.  Then this charlatan comes along into our sub and trolled the shit out of us.  I don't want this guy around, pretty sure the majority does either  




 Well he's gonna get down voted if he ever tries to post, so I'm cool with that 




 Sorry, I don't share the same sentiment.  I avoid subreddits like r\food because people started to post stock photos claiming it was thier own creation.  Reddit wasn't like this 4 years ago.  It was genuine posts from real folks.  It's changed now and sometimes for the worse.  I wasn't expecting any frauds to, certainly not on this sub..  

So yeah, fuck OP 




 This if borderline psychopath.  




 Hope this makes it onto best of Reddit.  Frontpage 









 Damn man, it's guys like you that have ruined Reddit.  The past 2-3 years this place got more popular and then shitheads like you discovered Reddit.  "Hey derp, look how cool I am!".

You got some fucking issues.  Maybe you got picked on too much in High school, not enough pussy, who knows.  But go fuck off, you should be banned from r\warriors.   




 Thanks I find it hilarious the lengths people go to post stock images on here.  All I wanted to know was whether OP made it or not.  Even funnier that he got gold.   




 I stopped lurking on r/food bc people started posting stock photos of food pics claiming they made it rather than giving credit to the original.  Never would i imagined this level of attention seeking would come to this subreddit 




 Playoff ball is much slower, grind it out pace.  After watching that Bogut video posted here, I was thinking the same.  That said, Mosgov is quick on his feet and can keep up with Bogut 




 So do you always post glamor pics w/out context?  Where is this from, recipe?  Did you make this? 




 And one day you might end up missing, and some shithead will make a similar comment such as yours, during a time when their friends and family are pleading with the public.   




 Yeah let's dismiss the playoff game in Atlanta, or outgunning Brady in Foxborough, or handling Carolina in the playoffs.  

 




 More like rye bread.  Dark on the outside, light in the inside  




 The debate was never about Harden sucking.  It was whether he worthy of winning the MVP over Curry.  Unfortunately critics will be using game 5 as an example

 Oven baked salmon and sable fish.  In the bowl is a potato salad, served with rye, pumpernickel, and of course bagels 









 Seemed as though in the 2nd half, Fez had more of a impact than Bogut.  Other than foul trouble, and Howard being hurt, do you think Ezeli is the better play?  

Just for clarification, this is not to trash Bogut.   




 Separate sticks  




 Pro tip:  separate the meats and veggies when skewering.  You can run risk of cross contamination and veggies cook much faster so you won't run the risk of over cooking  




 2011 Justin Smith was a piece of work, lotta of the highlights of him as a 49er were that year.  That being said, I felt like last year there was a slight drop off with him.  Of course I would want him back, but it creates urgency and guys like Aldon have been stepping up big time.  It's hard to tell yet, but I think our D Line will still produce 




 Dwight Howard, Kobe, CP....  Oh wait sorry

 My Mom and Dad always thought Turkey was so dry and bland.  Granted we overcooked the bird on occasion, but overall they didn't really get why American's had such as obsession over Turkey on Thanksgiving.   




 Assuming most of Reddit is young folks, but I always likened Barnes games to Jamal Mashburn.  Very similar post game, both are 6'8.  Mash had a better jumper, but Barnes ceiling is way higher.  Here's a [clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS2B_5wDU6U)

 




 I think in time he"ll find that mid range jumper.  What's nuts is that he's still bulking up, and could be a solid post threat later down the road.   




 It's another scoring option that Memphis has to pay attention to, especially if Barnes is posting Courtney lee.  Its gotta be demoralizing when you spend all your energy on trying to stop Steph and Klay, and then having Harrison come down the lane for a 2 handed dunk  




 I agree, he's only going to get better.  People forget how young he is.   




 Barnes sometimes gets heat for not being more consistent, but he was a beast in game 4.  Some of his post moves looked eerily similar to his breakout series against the Spurs a few years ago.  He's also had 4-5 monster dunks last game 




 Who gives a shit?  As long as we play our game, the refs will have no impact 




 Winning on the road is a must for championship teams.  The lakers in the early 2000s were down 2-1 in series many times and we all know how that ended.  No need to panic, I expect a game 7 




 Harrison looked real solid, I'm surprised they didn't run more Iso through him, especially when Lee was guarding him 




 You hit it straight on, I think the MVP presentation before the game got the team too hyphy.  They were jacking up quick shots, not enough ball movement.   




 How many times is that now?  3 times accused of cheating 




 Why is this considered justice?  DUI manslaughter is punishable to up to 30 years, this girl got 24.   




 Not trying to be biased by age, but it's because r/nba is filled with immature kids 14-19 y.o.

 




 I'm so EXCITED!!! 




 Dude really original taking the Mr Rogers quote and slapping a picture on it.   Just a few hours earlier same quote different pic

 It's that and a combination of the biggest 2 floppers in the league i.e Paul and Griffin. 

 How is it that a power forward as big as Griffin is always on the ground?  And follow that up with Paul's whiny ass always getting tangled up with everyone?  Then these 2 have the nerve to bitch and complain.  That's why people are getting fed up with their shit and the act entitled

 Hey, fellow WVD!  When I was diagnosed at birth, my parent's didn't get too involved, but as I got older I wanted to learn everything there is to know.  I also used to work for NHF, so if you have any questions, feel free to PM me.  

[National Hemophilia Foundation](http://www.hemophilia.org/Bleeding-Disorders/Types-of-Bleeding-Disorders) is a good start to understand the basics as well as other bleeding disorders.  Also, you can 1.800.42.HANDI and ask for any VWD educational info.  They will send it to you free of charge

I would also contact your local chapter depending on what city/state you live in.  They will be a good resource for you depending on the types of programs they offer. 

If you don't know yet, you must learn to self infuse.  Your HTC should teach you this.  

I'm sure other people in this sub will chime in.  Good luck and no worries

 What a bitch 




 I think Lee's liability on defense will limit his minutes esp come playoff time.  Going against Aldridge, Ibaka, Duncan, etc he's going to be outmatched.  Also the pace of playoff basketball slows down to a lot more to half court sets, which is another knock against Lee.

 You should stop by r/food.  Its stock photos galore, sometimes people will crop out the water mark to claim as their own.   




 You forgot to mention asshole, since that's what spews out your fucking mouth.  Say it with me, "ASSHOLE" 




 Look, Reddit has gone to shit these days, and it's because fake mother fuckers like you.  I've been on this 4+ years, and once in awhile there would be a fake pic here and there.  These days, it's everywhere.  Take R/Food for instance.  It's so fake b.c of fuckers like you that it should re named R/Stockphoto.  

And get off your fucking soapbox regarding what Reddit should be.  I'm not about to get lectured from some fuckwit.   




 I'll say it like this.  Reddit has gone to shit lately b.c of these exact posts.  R/Food became R/stockphoto because people automatically assumed OP made the food.  This wasn't so 4+ years ago, where I could see actual food posts that were real.  Just a few weeks ago, the top posts on r/food were all stock.  No description, background info, nothing.     




 Damn man/woman, is your self esteem that fucking low?  That's a rhetorical question.  What the fuck is wrong with you?   Reddit has gone to shit lately, and its b.c of punk asses like you.  Go fuck yourself.  Plus now everyone knows your shit username.  Good luck creating another account so you can post more fake picsc
