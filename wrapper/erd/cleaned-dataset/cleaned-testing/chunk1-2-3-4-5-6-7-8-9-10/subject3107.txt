 Wow... That was uncalled for. 




 How do we escape? 




 Lock your door like everyone says and hope he isn't in there with you. Definitely call the police AND let someone close to you know what's going on, a friend or a parent, etc. The likelihood is that this is someone you know what messing with you, hence the Lulu. But it would be stupid to take any chances.

tl;dr hide and call the fucking police asap 




 Am I missing something? Yes, relatives can be strange but what are you trying to convey. 




 Straight up man you need to call a priest or an exorcist or a ghidt hunter something along those lines. If your parents don't believe you there are two options: 1) Explain the whole ordeal to your parents WITH your siblings and say all you want is to call a priest etc to ease the nervousness. 2) do olit behind their backs when they aren't home or something.

Either way you have to do it.
Good luck OP. 




 Definitely anything by Christopher. Nympho is especially good.

Also, can someone make this playlist on a different service like 8tracks as Spotify isn't available in every country? :) 




 Sorry, everybody I no longer have anymore Aviate invites. However, I will keep this post up in hopes that some others will have a spares. I'm really sorry to anyone who I didn't get to! x 




 shoot me a pm with your email, or comment on my post about invites and i'd love to! 




 I just got Aviate and I have 5 invites for anyone who wants them. Just shoot me a PM or comment your email! All I ask is you return the favor for any other redditors who need it. Maybe we could start a bit of a chain? 

P.S. Aviate is great, I highly recommend it! If you're sort of on the fence about getting it or not, I suggest trying it out for a few days, it really helps to have everything laid out as simply as it is. Good luck new Aviators! 
























 Yes. That was surprising but in an amazingly good way. 




 Toronto FC is actually doing extremely well this season... 




 As a Netherlands fan who is not Dutch, I cannot imagine what they are going through. As for me, six contractors have approached me requesting to use the bricks I have shat to build a new apartment complex. Stay strong Oranje! 




 I think the Dutch will finally get that star :) 




 I worry people will lose respect for Julio Cesar who is a fantastic goalie and really has been Toronto FC's saving grace this season. 




 Thanks for the advice, I'll have a look :) 




 Try C and Am :) 




 It helps to just look up the guitar chords and play around with those. Most of the time you only need to make minor changes to make it sound good on a uke. Good luck! 




 Alright that makes sense. Good luck :) 
























 Hey! I reckon myself a pretty decent pop singer, and I'd love to collaborate with you sometime!

 That is part of our research but our project requires we get opinions from different cultures and peers regardless of their knowledge,  we do not necessarily need to consider it a reliable source, we just need to show evidence of a spectrum of opinions. 




 What is your perspective on whether or not the U.S Foreign Aid towards the Syrian refugees has been sufficient? (Opinions on Obama and Syrian Refugees) 

For a school project (iGCSE GP), I need to get a range of opinions.-so I thought Reddit would be a good place to come to. What are your opinions on how The US and/or other countries have handled the issue and Syria and how they have/should have dealt with the issue of refugees? Also feel free to add any information on the topic too. If you don't mind, I would appreciate of you stated your culture/home country since I need to show I have opinions from a variety of backgrounds. Thank you so much :)

 Im 80% sure I'm gonna be watching the world cup next year! :) 




 You should've deleted everything dude. And boy am I glad I didn't comment on the last two posts. Call the police is all I have to say. Good luck OP. 




 UPDATE:

OK guys. I checked out La Senza today and they didn't sell anything above D but a 32D seemed like a good fit. I'm guessing 32E will be perfect so thank you to anyone who suggested I try that size instead! :) 
























 There's nothing to do but go all out now.  Upload the audio files, dig deeper,  because you're fucked anyway. 




 **Defying Gravity** because when I hit the notes I feel like a princess and when I don't it's still a hell of a lot of fun. 

**Chandelier** channels my inner shower goddess. 

**La Vie en Rose** because it's absolutely gorgeous. 

**I Won't Say I'm in Love** because it's my favourite Disney song. 

**Bang Bang** and **Drunk in Love** because there's so much room to mess around.

 No problem dude, stay safe! 




 It might not be smart to keep the file and its contents in your home.  As the investigation progresses they will almost certainly search your property. You're going to have to find a secure place to hide it. 




 I would absolutely love to collab with you, female vocalist btw. I rather sing over tracks with lyrics already written, but I'm also open to collaborating with lyrics. :) 




 I'll see what I can do :) 




 Do you want us to devise lyrics as well? Or do you have some planned?

Female vocalists here btw
 




 I may not sound exactly like Taylor Swift, but you can try me?
 
























 This actually happened with my old phone and the way I fixed it was by getting a hairdryer on low heat and blowing full speed into the jack for a few minutes. It actually worked! 




 Amen sister, this is the biggest problem for me. I try to play low and hold the uke around my abdomen area, but really whenever I can sit, I do. 




 CM Locker ! 




 Thank you! Yeah I definitely took advance of artistic licence with this one,  it's not really historically accurate,  but I think I captured the essence. :) 




 Thank you for the feedback! I'm so glad you like the eyes! I'm normally not very creative with my eyeshadow and just wear a single colour if any at all,  so this was very new for me.  I tried very hard with the eyebrows but it was really hard as naturally my brows are very thick and bold (they were glued down and hidden under layers  of concealer!) and you're totally right about the cat eye,  I just got a wee bit carried away :p

 Good point!  I will try this,  thanks! 




 Thanks so much :) I'll try to bring my laptop but no guarantees. 




 I just finished day 2 of insanity (yes, I'm a newbie) but I've run into a problem. I'm travelling this weekend and I definitely won't be able to do insanity. Would it be acceptable if I just did some cardio (treadmill, elliptical) at a gym for the 2 days, or is this going to affect my progress.

Thanks!

 I use reddit now :) 




 I might be of some help

 I love this track! I've been working on it a bit and I think I have some lyrics that could work, but it would really help if you sent me some lyrical ideas. I really hope I get to record over this track, it's honestly so good.

 This is something I'll never know for sure, and I don't think I want to. 




 Thanks for your support, and I'm really glad you were able to get clean. I'm sober now, and I wrote this story as sort of a reflection on the mistakes I've made, and I'm really glad that the responses are so positive.

  nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;*Rock-a-bye baby, on the treetop,*

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;*When the wind blows, the cradle will rock,*

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;*When the bough breaks, the cradle will fall,*

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;*And down will come baby, cradle and all.*




 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Things arent always as they seem; one move can shatter all youve built, yet all youve built isnt always deliberate. My brain is muddled with the mistakes I have made, will make and am making. Ive always had so much, I still dobut the more I have the less wholesome it feels. My eyes used to be filled with light, colour, and significancenow I am shadowed by the constant euphoria.

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Euphoria:- a feeling or state of intense excitement and happiness. 

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Euphoria used to mean thatgood thingsbut now it consumes me. It grew steadily; started as a slight nagging and grew to a beast, taking bites out of me with every inhalation. I still remember the day that it all started, the day that I broke the last straw, lost the last emotion; the day I made the mistake of walking home after my graveyard shift.
	
 
 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Trust me, lady, the shady man from the alley said as he grabbed my armit wasnt hard but it was far from gentlewhispering with heavy breaths, I can see it in your eyes.	

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I need to go, I shuddered in response; I was so scared, so unfamiliar.
	
 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;You's sad, I can see it, I know what you need, lady, trust me, he went on, shoving a bag in my face, *this* is the stuff you need. I started to become frustrated, I mean, there was a smelly, shady young man whispering in my ear about some drug; little did I know, he would become my saviour.
	
 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I dont think *hallucinations*, are going to help me put my life back together, I spat. Oh, the irony! I thought I had hit rock bottom back then, I didnt know of the trenches lying ahead of me.
	
 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;No, lady, heroin isnt like that. You wont hallucinate like MDMA or LSD; its a nice friendly drug. he explained, this shit doesnt get you high, or screw you up, everything thing is just mellow, and happythe world is beautiful. That was the point where I was starting to become convinced, you could smoke it at home, smoke it at work; heroin doesnt create, it *erases.* Sold, at the drop of a hat. That manwhom I now know as Trey, or in situations Ive tried to repress, *babe*knew how to use his words to manipulate me into doing whatever he pleased, a skill that proved useful to him later on. I revisited that alleyway 47 times after the fact, but I met Trey himself 164 timesour relationship evolved from simply the purchase and sale of heroin. At the time, it wasnt manipulation, it was rescue: I was lonely, depressed, and barely managing to maintain a dead-end waitressing job; Trey showed me the drug that dissolved all my negativity, and his own presence dispersed my loneliness. What I now realize was the exploitation of resources seemed at the time to be real, maybe my rationality was altered by the heroin, but I felt the most sane Ive ever been. Nine times out of ten, I would go somewhere with Trey and smoke the stash Id bought *with* him, when I could only afford less but what I needed was more, he would even share some of his. I was so young and so stupid; I thought thats what love was, *sharing your heroin.* God, I was so stupid.  

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;It didnt take long for me to fall in what I thought was love, but could you blame me? I was being provided with powdered happiness, the only thing I was really living for. I never realized that I had never spent a night with him sober; I made him priority, my moments with him were the only moments that mattered. To him, I was simply a customer, and then a sex toyI was never a human being. Yet night after night I texted him over and over, smoked with him, made love to himthe cycle continued for months, and I loved it, but every thing must come to an end. A rude awakening, clichd and yet the most unexpected thing to ever happen: I was pregnant; I missed my period the last month. At first, I brushed it off as a side effect of the alien substance running through my veins, but in a burst of rationality I got myself tested. I kept smokingbut I started to get careful, only smoking once a week, then once every two, however, I could never bring myself to really stop, why didnt I stop? About 3 months in, I told Treywell, I didnt tell him, he noticed my hesitance and then my stomach, and with my lack of comprehensible response, he caught on.
	
 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Youre goddamn pregnant, he mumbled one day, obviously numbed by the drugs, you cant smoke my shit anymore. I saw it as an act of care, a muted I love you, but to him it was just a lost customer, lost money. In a stroke of epiphany my saviour and my enemy all at once developed another business idea. If you smoke it, the baby gets all the drugs, he spoke confidently, making me believe he had some medical knowledgealthough, I would have believed anything from him at that point, but if you inject it just stays in *your* blood. Brilliant, absolutely brilliant; take my pregnancy and turn it into an investment, sell me more expensive drugs, take me even further down the rabbit hole. I never stopped doing heroin throughout my pregnancy. Trey left a few months later, as soon as he found out there wasnt going to be an abortion, as soon as found out this was as much his responsibility as it was mine. He may have moved across the country or across the street, I didnt know, but he blocked my calls and I gave up. I found another dealer, and I gave up. Thats how I know it wasnt love on my part either, at least not love for the man, but for his produce. 

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I was dedicated to that drug, so dedicated that I never thought more ahead than the next morning, I never thought about what I was doing to myself. I took 20 hits of heroin a day in my last trimester; I needed that much to handle the side effects of pregnancy. I half-expected the baby to die before I had to care for itbut it was stronger than I. April 26th8 months and 23 days of pregnancyI went into labour. The pain covered my entire body to such an extent that not even the heroin could make it stop; I felt almost helpless, I had no *human* friends to guide me. I knew only one thing coming into thisand its implications:

1.  I have no money
	* I cannot afford to go to the hospital
	* I cannot afford to raise this baby

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Despite my long-term patronage to heroin, there remained sparse drops of sanity within me, and through those I determined that my only option was to keep the child. It was through those drops that I also realized the health of the baby would not be substantial, in fact, it is miraculous that the foetus remained to grow throughout the entire gestation period; the baby will be severely messed up if it survives birth. I had gotten myself into a situation that had no upside, but due to the influence I was under, I was so goddamn calm. I hadnt a clue what I was to do, yet I hadnt a crap to giveor perhaps a better way to explain was that I hadnt the ability to feel, everything had a silver lining, even if it didnt. 
	
 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I birthed the baby on my living room floor; I chose to do so because the carpeting was a deep maroon, therefore any stains would not be overly detrimental. He came out blue and silent, but he wasnt deadhe was also not normal. He was ugly, it was so ugly. I knew for a fact such aesthetic could only stem from deformity, there was a muddled order of the features on its face, features that were not mine. This is not a child I felt the want or need to keep in my home, nor did I have the means of doing so. In what I thought was an excellent plan, I took the baby to the cool darkness outside of my home, and settled him gently on the floor. Using the materials around me I fashioned an intricate cradle of sticks and leavessturdier than concreteand gently hung it upon the branch of a tree, low enough that I could just reach it. Gently, I placed the baby in its new cradle; I had the urge to kiss the baby goodbye, to feel any compassion, but the feeling was too easy to dismiss. In that moment, I had justified my own decision; if I didnt love the baby, nobody would. I would visit it in the morning to feed and comfort it, I would keep the baby alive so not to be deemed a murderer; everything made so much sense.

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I woke up the next morning, exceedingly sober. The implications of my actions slowly trickled into the back of my mind, like a drop of blood down my scalp. *I gave birth last night, while high, and I left the baby in a forest.* Glancing at the clock I noticed it had only been a few hours, I hoped to salvage the situation. That was the first morning in a very long time in which my primary thought had not been heroin. Running outside, it hit me that it was much too late; there was no possibility of a happy ending. By the trees I noticed what I though was a cradle and now realized is nothing but a pile of sticks and junk on the floor, stained slightly browner than its surroundings. The overwhelming smell of loss encompassed me as I lifted the cradle away, revealing what was underneath. The foetus was covered in blood, skull cracked open, unmistakably dead. In my delusion, I did not witness myself hang a baby to a tree with some sticks, I did not realize how far my life had crashed downwards, how much I had ruined myself, I did not know that down would come baby, *cradle and all.* 




 Alas, it is morning, now we await the hint. 




 Any tips?  




 if you replace each pair with its new number value (frequency) you get:

462746274614 461546272 4615227 4614462719 19275 461546271927 46141915 19275 4631927 4615463 461446274627 4614192746 19275 46144614 4615463 4614192746 46141915 4614462719 19275 4615461446 461546271927 46151914 461546272 4614462719 461546154627 4615227 4614192746 461519274627 191 19275 




 Since OP said looking at frequency is a good idea, I looked at how many times each pair was repeated.

A0 = 46
A1 = 27

B0 = 19
B1 = 15

C0 = 2
C1 = 14

D0 = 2
D1 = 3

E0 = 5
E1 = 0

F0 = 0
F1 = 1

idk maybe this means something 




 Qatar Airways. A group of teenagers was flying alone from Doha to Washington DC and their connecting flight had to land in a country two hours away because of a little drizzle. We then proceeded to miss our flight to DC and the airline took essentially zero responsibility. It took 3 hours to get tickets on the next flight and then we were informed we would be contracted regarding accommodation. They gave other passengers meal vouchers but none to us and we were not contacted about accommodation.. When seeking it for ourselves all rooms were booked to other passengers who arrived 5 hours after our group did. Then, we were not even provided with blankets as we slept on the airport floor for 24 hours and received complaints from staff.... Again, this was a group of teenagers alone... NEVER AGAIN.
