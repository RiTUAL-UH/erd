 Either works well. An accounting and finance degree is more immediately practical for that specific job. An econ degree, especially from a good school is more respected even beyond banking since its a harder degree. Either way for banking, you need to follow the templatized recruitment process and network hard. 




 Yes. Its possible. You need to network hard and be in NY a lot. The other responses are spot on that the best place to start is your alumni network. Join your college finance club and do things like training the street to get up to speed on valuation / modeling, etc.


 









 fine :) I take it back. It does get expensive and its a continuum of costs as you look to get further certifications and rack up flight hours.

My new answer is get Microsoft VBA certified. Nothing says "popular with the ladies" like Microsoft VBA certified 




 I agree. it can range. It was a long time ago and prices have gone up since then. The point being that its in that range, is relatively non-cumbersome to get a VFR and is a very fun hobby that people like to learn more about. Also I think its likely cheaper  to get in SoCal than Canada (but maybe not $5k any more) 




 You are absolutely right. Salary depends on a lot of things. 

If you are asked a salary requirement in a form at the start of an interview process - just leave it blank. There is almost no upside to giving them a number until you are close to getting the job.

When you are close to getting the job, they will typically call and ask you for a range or number. There are a range of negotiating techniques but the most effective one (proven by studies) has been found to be a range, where the salary you are willing to accept is the low end of that range, and your top end of that range is  10-20%  over that. Typically your current salary should be below that range because presumably your switching costs involve you not wanting to move for the same pay.

Quote the salary as all-in. i.e., basic salary + bonus. Benefits are important but somewhat secondary. If their benefits package is weak, you should tactically let them know that during the negotiation process if thats important to you.

 Yeah I just meant VFR. I think all great hobbies cost time and money to really pursue but the question was just for a skill that was cool, cheap and quick. A VFR fits those requirements.  









 If you live in places like Southern California, its not that hard or expensive to become a private pilot. It costs ~$5,000 and takes 40 hours of lessons to get the basic pilot certification. 

I know thats relatively expensive compared to the other things people mention below, but its not much for a really cool hobby. People always want to chat with you if you are a private pilot.

EDIT: This post previously said 40 years / I meant 40 hours. Typo. But candidly, y'all are an impatient bunch.  




 I run a career website http://tapwage.com

We have curated collections of jobs and career articles completely free. I'll readily admit that there are many free job sites out there and media sites out there. But we are trying really hard to provide a quality job finding and career advice experience. 

For our early users, If you ask us a career question or ask for a specific type of job you are interested in, we'll help you find those jobs or answers.  




 Your resume looks fine but its really useful to make it a little more action oriented so it shows that you care about the results of what you achieve. 

Simple things: e.g., are there certain subjects where you consistently scored As? Can you elaborate on the achievements at your volunteer efforts. How many students did you tutor?

Fix the formatting on your resume. Right now the line spaces are inconsistent and that looks sloppy.

 On its own "ethical investing" doesn't outperform other forms of investing, and sometimes underperforms - for good reasons. Its hard enough finding alpha (outsized returns) in a  relatively efficient market place, its really hard to do that with constraints. Moreover, the best portfolio managers are not incentivized to do ethical investing.

I like how the industry has evolved beyond that to "impact investing". This is more than ethical investing. This is looking at specific areas where you know resource allocation has been awry (for political, social and / or cultural reasons) and using investing to correct that imbalance. 

A great example is funds that invest in women and / or minority founders. Its well known and well documented that women and minorities struggle to raise money from traditional VCs. But mathematically, there is no reason for this segment of founders to under-perform for any reason. So impact investing in this segment has an arbitrage benefit where you can fund underrepresented founders and avail of overlooked opportunities. As the systemic biases normalize though, the alpha opportunities will reduce. But others might come up. These types of investing have shown the ability to perform and outperform the market. That said, it still depends a lot on the quality of investment manager talent that these funds are able to get.

We wrote a guide to impact investing here: http://tapwage.com/cheatsheets/2015/05/06/guide-to-impact-investing

 Impact investing is a really interesting way to look at the world. I don't think CSR fully reflects that wide range of things impact investing is. Impact investing is also evolving so its not just "sustainable investing" or "non profit" investing but like any investing its about finding alpha (outsized returns). There happen to be meaningful outsized returns in areas like renewable energy, sustainable emerging market business models, and investing with women and minority founders who have traditionally found it harder to raise money within the existing VC ecosystem.

 very well put! 




 Supply chain jobs? No. These are resource allocation / analytics jobs that are fairly high end. These jobs can easily pay upwards of $100k / year at many big firms. The tools and data and analytics continue to get more advanced - there is a real focus on big data and using insight driven forecasting tools. Some of the more manual elements of this job will get automated like low-end procurement type roles but that can be said if almost any job (even programming jobs get automated as tools get more advanced). What is likely to happen to these jobs is that they continue to get more sophisticated, require more training and become higher paying.

The other important thing to remember is that supply chain is really the integration and coordination of many different functions that used to be separate like sourcing, manufacturing, logistics, distribution. Massive companies like Coca Cola, Nike, etc. have realized that by centrally managing, forecasting, planning and negotiating, they can save massive amounts of money, and ensure that new products can be distributed instantly where there is demand. The supply chain is actually the central nervous systems of these companies connecting the various silos. Many companies are only just beginning this integration and coordination, which is why supply chain jobs are in such demand. As this supply chain revolution continues - these jobs will continue to remain in demand for a while
 




 no. I just remembered to remind you since sometimes people search for continents and our search isn't fully built yet (focus is on curated collections of jobs). We'll have real time smart searching capabilities soon. We get our jobs from thousands of companies directly 




 Thats really interesting. Btw: my site is in its early stages. Best way is to search for Singapore or Hong Kong (or Kuala Lumpur) on it as opposed to searching for "Asia". We will enable a smarter search soon. 

Let me know if you have questions on moving to Singapore. Its a great place to work and live.  




 Being a product manager is a really interesting job at many companies, especially technology companies because you get to experience the life cycle of a product across various division - finance, strategy, technology, supply chain, marketing, etc.

So these roles can be great stepping stone to broader management careers. I think of product management at a tech company to supply chain type jobs at big consumer companies. These are breeding grounds for future leadership.

The best way to understand what these roles are and what these roles require int terms of experience and skill set is by looking at a range of these job postings and getting a sense from how they are framed. Typically these are for former techies who have some management experience or potentially an MBA and show strategic thinking capabilities and good interpersonal capabilities. These roles liaise with nearly every functional group in the company so great interpersonal skills is key.

Here is a collection of some product management roles:
http://tapwage.com/channel/big-tech-product-manager

I run a career site - tapwage.com
If any of you have questions on these roles and how to get them, feel free to contact me 




 yes, we do. We are adding a lot more jobs in that area soon, but right now, we do have thousands of jobs in Asia across industries / fields. I love Asia. I used to be an expat in Singapore ages ago. Nice choice of continent to go to.  




 We have jobs and career advice for all industries globally. Either way - I hope you find a job you love. Good luck! 




 This is actually a wide range of jobs including supply chain, procurement and sourcing. Tim Cook, CEO of Apple was a long -time executive in Supply Chain at Compaq and then Apple before rising to the roles that led to becoming CEO of Apple.

So what is Supply Chain? It is the planning and management of the supply of a companies products to the market place. Right from sourcing the raw materials, getting them manufactured, handling shipping and logistics to getting them to the right distributors and retailers. 

As companies become more global, products become more advanced and complicated to make (an iPhone involves thousands of components sourced from all over the world), this job becomes really important.

You don't need to study supply chain to do it. Study finance or business, or accounting, or engineering. Focus on numbers and quantitative analysis, join a large organization as a supply chain analyst or procurement analyst and learn on the job. These jobs can pay very well and can give you a unique chance to learn the company and industry end to end and one day rise to a C-level position.

I run a career site - Tapwage.com and have a ton of great supply chain jobs at the biggest brands around the world here:

If you have questions about this, contact me here or on Tapwage and will be happy to give you more guidance 




 I would avoid this. I run a career site (tapwage.com) and we have seen and heard of a lot of instances of this going badly. You potentially get sued or have your reputation tarnished over something that at best makes you slightly more efficient. Not to mention, the recent situation where the Goldman programmer went to jail as a result. 

In general, what you do at work is the employers property, even if it doesn't contain non-public information, so on the whole, I would avoid taking templates or any similar work products with you. Have faith in yourself that you will build better templates at your new work environment 




 Posting to multiple sub-reddits is not an automatic sign of spam. Unclear of the guideline here.  




 I agree with this but sometimes companies frown upon people sending emails home. On my work email and home email, I keep a folder called "Contact Information" and move those emails to that folder as soon as I get them. Then if / when I leave the job, I print those emails out and take with me. 

 














 There are actually quite a lot of interesting data science and quantitative roles that you can search for across industries but sometimes its not easy to find them since they are called a lot of different things. We started a site - tapwage.com to curate job collections to address this sort of thing. A few such channels you can look at are:

http://tapwage.com/channel/artificial-intelligence-meets-financial-intelligence (this has quant jobs in banks for engineers)
http://tapwage.com/channel/data-driven-internships

There is also an article that discusses this in greater detail: http://tapwage.com/cheatsheets/2015/05/08/big-data-means-big-employment

PM / or message us on the site if you have questions and happy to answer further questions or create a custom collection for you. 




 I disagree with the below comments that say that there are only data science jobs in NY or the bay area There are actually data science jobs all over, especially since corporate employers are really focused on this capability.

Check out Data science job collections on tapwage.com to get a curated list of such jobs: http://tapwage.com/?tag=%5B145%5D

 Hilarious story of the guy who asked Quora what job he should choose

http://tapwage.com/cheatsheets/2015/05/07/how-to-lose-a-job-offer-in-10-days 




 Quitting a job is hard. If you have been with a company a long time, it's often like leaving family. I am convinced that a lot of people are so terrified about the thought of resigning that they just put off finding a new job, even if they aren't satisfied with their current one. This post is to help you through the logistics of resigning. Assuming you have made the decision to accept another offer, or pursue something else, follow these steps to make sure you transition from your current role in a graceful and organized way. 

Go to this link to see the checklist and read the article:
http://tapwage.com/cheatsheets/2015/05/07/7-things-to-do-before-you-resign


 




 There are quite a lot of roles you can look at:
1. Marketing or business roles at biotech companies and pharma cos like J J often look for biotech undergraduates

2. Go to a startup. There are many great startup life sciences firms looking for someone with scientific experience but for non-scientific roles and at a startup, you can grow with the organization into other positions.
Check out this collection of jobs here: 
http://tapwage.com/channel/startup-biologist

You could even go to a bank or investment firm and do biotech research, many of which require biotech / scientific experience and undergraduate degrees:
http://tapwage.com/searchresult?keyword=biotech location=
 




 That is a conundrum. You should never tell an employer that you are looking to leave until you actually will leave.

I would actually be honest with your boss. Tell him or her that the reason you had confessed to wanting to leave is because you felt alienated and not socially integrated, but that you enjoy the work and his / her mentorship. Tell them that you have had a chance to think about it and if they are open to it, you would like to stay and build a career. And ask for their advice on how you could do better to socially integrate at work. 

If that doesn't go well, check out http://tapwage.com and see if you can find a better job. Designers are in huge demand and there are great jobs out there. Good luck! 




 AI and Machine learning developers are in huge demand. This is an interesting collection of jobs at banks and hedge funds looking for developers in investment roles:
http://tapwage.com/channel/artificial-intelligence-meets-financial-intelligence 




 Thats not an uncommon route path at all. Most common route to Private equity is via an investment bank. Join as an analyst and after the 2-year program, its very easy to recruit into PE. You can try and do that right after undergrad but its harder.

For Portfolio Management, a CFA helps a lot. Again, these roles are easier after 2 years in the investment banking or sales and trading analyst program. IBs tend to have structured recruiting and big classes and then the PE and hedge funds tend to recruit from there.

 For someone of your experience, your base salary sounds about right but the bonus seems like there should be upside to that number, especially in a city like NY. Without knowing your detailed background, three potential career choices come to mind:

1. Move from a software lead to more of a technical manager / project manager role, either at a large corporation - this may not be much of a premium to your current pay but can offer you better career advancement opportunities

2. Look for a similar technical manager role at a startup (a large startup if needed to avoid overt risk). This might be at or around your base but ideally gets you meaningful stock upside, and there is the chance to handle real responsibilities and grow with the company

3. If you are ready for a bigger leap and do have some business experience / interest to go with it, try your hand at product management jobs. These take you further away from the code but give you a better chance at building a management career if you are so inclined, and therefore the long term compensation potential is better

I have curated three collections of each of these types of jobs here:
http://tapwage.com/channel/code-boss-fortune-100

http://tapwage.com/channel/code-boss-unicorn-startups

http://tapwage.com/channel/big-tech-product-manager

http://tapwage.com/channel/managing-a-startup-product-senior-edition


Good luck and if you have something else in mind, or something more specific, ping me and I can try and craft a more custom collection to give you an idea of what some of the options are.  




 yeah, it might be something like your transferable skill set isn't coming across clearly in the interviews which you can then refine with practice. Good luck.  




 Thats really odd. Do you generally send a thank you email to your interviewer (not the recruiter)? It might be worth sending them an email after the interview with a simple "I really enjoyed meeting with you. I understand that I was not the right fit for the role. Can I trouble you for 15 minutes of your time over the phone to better understand how I could prepare myself better for this role since its one that I am really keen on". Try that with a few of your interviewers and you might get some candid feedback that the recruiter is not sharing with you.  









 what types of corporate careers are you applying to?

There are a few types of careers you could consider given that you have a) people skills b) managerial skills and a history in finance

1. Get a customer experience job at a startup. 
These roles can be fascinating ways for graduates of a range of majors and backgrounds to build a career at a startup and be a part of a fast growing environment. Compared to customer service roles at more mature corporates, these are often critical roles at a startup for introducing the innovative product to a new customer base and helping customers navigate a disruptive and novel experience. These roles can be stepping stones to sales and business development careers as well as other leadership roles
Examples of such jobs are here:
http://tapwage.com/channel/hello-customer-meet-startup

2. Try and get a junior sales job at a larger corporate. Examples of such jobs are here:
http://tapwage.com/channel/rainmakers-with-benefits

3. Try and get into HR / recruiting. You probably have good people skills and these can be great roles to build a career in. A few examples of such roles are here:
http://tapwage.com/channel/people-person-unicorn-edition
http://tapwage.com/channel/get-and-deliver-the-perks

Good luck and reach out if you have more specific questions 


































 Without a ton of facts, on the face of it, 45k seems reasonable at this stage. Its lower than what you would make in a bigger city but its not dramatically lower.

One easy way to check - go on a freelance site like upwork, show your portfolio and see if you are able to command  $30 / hour. (alternatively, try their HTML and CSS tests and see how you score relative to other developers there that do command  $30 / hr). That will give you a sense of whether you are underpaid or not based on your relative skills.   




 You have been here a while. First - get the offer. No point counting unhatched chickens. If you get the offer and you like the offer (better money / responsibility), take it. Try and negotiate some time before you start so you can give your current employer some notice and transition the project. But you do not owe your employer that you will stay till the end of the project.  




 If you are good at sales, stick with it, and build a bigger specialty. Ideally, find a way to navigate into enterprise sales roles (selling to large companies) because those tend to be the most lucrative. Here is a collection of such jobs so you can see the types of jobs these are and the types of skills you need to get.

http://tapwage.com/channel/rainmakers-with-benefits

Good luck! 




 One idea that you may not have thought of is looking at startups in "customer experience" roles. These are (perhaps unfortunately) customer centric roles, which I know might be a problem since you describe yourself as not a people person. However, they are really interesting because you are effectively evangelizing and helping the customer experience with a new technology, so unlike retail, its a more promising role.

Moreover, at a startup, you can break barriers, spend time learning and potentially honing your technology and design skills, and have a career path as the startup grows. Moreover, the positive can-do vibe at a startup might be a good change of pace. 

I have compiled a list of such jobs here so you can take a look and see what these jobs are like:

http://tapwage.com/channel/hello-customer-meet-startup

Feel free to reach out to us on tapwage.com if you have more specific questions. Happy to try and help.  









 It really does sound like you have had a really rough spell. If you like your job, I would stick it out. Cities grow on you, even pedestrian unfriendly ones, and it takes time to build a network of friends and a support system. There is no guarantee that if you did move, you'd love that city either (unless you find a job in a city that you think is 'home' in some sense). Moreover, finding a job is often stressful and frustrating. 

I agree that a downward move will look bad. I think moving after a few months will look bad too, and especially without a great portfolio of work to show. 

Maybe instead of spending 10 hrs a week looking for a job (which is candidly the least amount of time it typically takes), spend 10 hrs a week signing up for a class, or volunteering, or trying something new and fun that might give you the chance to meet some people and settle into the city. 

 




 Sorry I am late to this discussion.

Yours is an interesting background. A career in equity research is a good option and worth pursuing. That said, your easiest path of action is pursuing an MBA from a top 15 school. Big banks recruit at these places and you will get the finance training you need to do well at an equity research role. A CFA would be useful and you will likely need to sit for those tests anyway in an equity research capacity but I agree with the responses that say that MBA   CFA given what you are looking for. I would however, at least take CFA level 1 and 2 during your business school. 

Other finance areas you could consider where you can leverage your healthcare /  bio background is high yield research (like equity research but on bonds), and credit risk management (again a similar role but slightly easier to break into for career changers)

Pasted below is a collection of junior equity research jobs:
http://tapwage.com/channel/picking-stocks

Take a look at these and the types of requirements that they entail and you will get a good idea of what you need for these jobs. If you have more questions - feel free to ping me on tapwage.com and we can try and be helpful. Good luck!

 









 1. I agree with TunaSandwich - better to have a job before you quit
2. I have found in my experience that sticking at your first job at least 2-3 years credentializes you. Also most jobs suck in the first year so its not unusual to not enjoy it
3. There are very few jobs out there that are going to pay 100k a year for your experience and background

Maybe look at other sales jobs: 
http://tapwage.com/channel/rainmakers-with-benefits (a collection of junior sales jobs at large companies)

http://tapwage.com/channel/selling-eyeballs (collection of ad sales jobs)

Do you have an idea of what you enjoy, or are good at? Do you want to get out of sales?

If you are really smart and quantitatively driven, you could consider junior banking and finance jobs. Those pay well and are very intellectually challenging. Here is a collection of those:

It will be tough but try and get an entry-level job at a large company and in general you will get the branding and the internal opportunities to grow a career. Good luck. Reach out (via the Tapwage.com site) if you have more questions  




 Try some environmental focused meet-ups or mixers. When you go to these events, try and avoid asking for a job. Just learn about what they do and bring up your experience and background. Then follow up with a linkedin message or connect after.

Have you tried connecting with people via linkedin? Even if you don't know people directly, I am guessing given your role as an ecologist, you have friends or colleagues who do and you can ask them for an introduction.

Identify the specific companies / departments you want to work for using the websites, and then find someone who know at the company (at any level and in any department) and try and have them submit it to the hiring manager/  HR from inside.  




 I forgot to add LPT pre-fix. Should I resubmit? 









 If you have an understanding of real estate and some finance experience as a loan officer, finding a role at a big real estate firm is a logical step. Look at a variety of companies like big real estate developers (rental and commercial), big data center companies that lease real estate (like digital realty), banks that do real estate financing, and also large corporations that have real estate arms.  Don't limit your choices

I run a career site (tapwage.com) focused on addressing such questions

 It will be hard. Unless you are going to get your degree at one of the top colleges like Harvard or Penn, chances are slim, and even then chances are difficult. There are other great jobs to look at. Maybe real estate finance at a local bank / financial institution. Either way - get moving while at college, try and do as many internships as you can over summers and through the school year and network hard. Good luck.

 Why are you panicking. There are a few different things you could do:

1. Look at startups. They are looking for smart people and are more open to diverse backgrounds. You could use your various skills to good use there. Maybe a data and analytics role given your programming skills, physics background and banking background:
Here is a collection of such jobs
http://tapwage.com/channel/data-driven-mbas-at-startups


2. Consider going to a bank looking for investment management jobs that involve programming. they re often open to physics backgrounds and great math skills. A collection of such jobs is here:

3. Consider going to a corporate and using your programming and analytical skill set. A collection of such jobs is here:
http://tapwage.com/channel/data-driven-mbas-at-big-corporates

4. If nothing else, before you try for Walmart, consider going to  a startup in a customer experience role. These are interesting and your verbal and written communication skills are probably good enough for some of these roles:

 What I thought was romantic at the time: Back in the early days of the internet, my gf at the time and I were doing our respective internships. I had internet at work which was fantastic. She only had access to email but no internet and constantly needed to look things up. So I stayed awake all weekend and wrote her a program that ran on my home desktop computer where she could email  search query and my computer would email the Yahoo or Altavista results (can't remember which) back to her. Then she could email the result link and it would download the page and email it to her as a static html page (the whole web was static html at the time so this was the easy part). 

What on hindsight was actually romantic? My gf and I lived in two different continents. I did 5 years of long distance. We moved to a 3rd continent, and then I moved cities twice, before finally moving in with her and now she is my wife and its been 10 years since we started dating. One of my better decisions.  














 I think its better to do marketing at a larger company, even if that means starting at an entry-level type role. It can be a good career path, a chance to learn data and analytics tools that are increasingly important in marketing today and a chance to get some branding on your resume. Risk with small agencies is that you end up with a decent job but not a great career trajectory from there.   




 What industry? Sales in general? If you have an aptitude for sales (some do, some don't) its very viable. Good sales people over time can either go on to either sell larger and more complex products and make meaningfully more money, go into strategic / business development roles, or take on sales leadership roles. So there is a valid career path if thats what you are interested in.

The same goes for marketing. 

Candidly - your best bet is either to go to a large organization where you can have meaningful career growth opportunities, mentorship and training, or to go to a decent sized startup that is growing fast so you get chances to grow alongside the company. The startup path is definitely more risky.

My advice to you would be to think about how to move to a company that can give you those types of career challenges and get you into more of a business role. You are absolutely right not to want to stay in administration. Sales / Marketing / Biz Dev at the right organizations will never go away and will always be rewarded.  




 Given that you have marketing experience and a marketing focused education (admittedly a minor), there is no reason why you shouldn't try and get a marketing job. 

This is a list of such roles that could be interesting:

http://tapwage.com/channel/fight-night-marketers

You could also potentially look at sales, especially ad-sales which is an interesting and lucrative path. Jobs like these:

http://tapwage.com/channel/selling-eyeballs

If you want to stay around fashion, there are a number of fashion focused startups you could look at as well. These are interesting because they might find parts of your background really interesting, they are more open ended roles where your responsibilities can grow as the company grows, and you can then transition into bigger roles at more established companies.

The way you position yourself in your resume and interview is really critical for any of these. If you come across too administrative focused, you often get typecast into office manager / admin roles. You really need to emphasize the marketing experience, show that you understand the broader industry dynamic and trends and had a more business-oriented role. Emphasizing quantitative and analytical skills over things like HTML / Photoshop will be helpful too (once you veer into HTML ./ Photoshop, people are unlikely to take you too seriously in a more marketing / analytics roles)

 




 Look for some Unity  / Open GL related open source projects on github and try and become a contributor to one of those teams. Having code contribution at a public project is often more impressive and a better validation of your skills to an employer than a private project you might do. Also good experience working with other developers and learning about the more practical elements of development 









 Consulting and Risk management have very structured recruiting cycles so you can apply for those roles but unless you are prepared on the path, its difficult to break into. 

Here are junior risk management jobs:
http://tapwage.com/channel/beach-closed-due-to-credit-risk-sighting

Here are junior consulting jobs:
http://tapwage.com/channel/from-consultant-to-corporate

For risk management, my advice would be to focus on non New York jobs that are more geared towards consumer risk management since those are easier to get into

A few other potential careers to think about:
1. HR: I know a lot of humanities majors that got a break into the corporate world in an HR role. These can be useful entry points and fairly interesting jobs. Like these:
http://tapwage.com/channel/people-person-unicorn-edition

2. Another option is potentially doing a writing job
http://tapwage.com/channel/pop-culture-writers

3. There are a number of Non-profit jobs here that don't require a masters degree

http://tapwage.com/channel/giving-back-to-the-art

http://tapwage.com/channel/non-profit-development-lieutenant 

unfortunately, each of these will take you away from your goal of IR. 

 




 It sounds like you should work at a startup in a data and analytics role. This might give you a chance to leverage your analytical skills but also work in the "core business", and do something exciting. Example of such jobs are here:
http://tapwage.com/channel/data-driven-mbas-at-startups

Another option is to try and move into impact investing. This is a really interesting career. Will combine your finance and analytical skills with your desire to do something more meaningful for society, traveling and adventure. Collection of such jobs here:

 Sorry that it took a while to come back to you. We are upgrading our search engine on our site to be instant and better. Once thats done I can point you to some interesting opportunities. 

One category of job that could be interesting is financial operations/  business analyst. This is inline with what a few people before said about potentially looking at banks. Some of these only require an associate degree or a GED. They have a real career path in finance and ops, and are less people-oriented and a chance to shape an interesting career

http://tapwage.com/searchresult?keyword=financial+operations location=Florida

Another option is to be an office manager. Also a good job with your skill set, a potential operations and administrative career path and potentially a better pay and perks than retail

http://tapwage.com/searchresult?keyword=office+manager location=Florida sortBy=relevance

We'll have an updated instant search engine by the end of the week so will be a lot easier to search for these jobs and you should be able to find quite a few in Florida / Southwest. 

Hope it gives you a few ideas about where to look.  





























 Roughly whereabouts are you based or what types of geographies are you looking at? We are still bulking up our job database but I can specifically dig in certain geographies if helpful (we just launched the site so would be a great test case for us) 




 The show TwentyTwelve that aired on the BBC (I am in the US. Saw it on iTunes). One of the funniest sitcoms of the last few years. 









 What type of consulting? Could you elaborate on the nature of the job? 




 Business development is one option. This is sort of sales-like but also involves strategic deals, partnership, channel management and can be really interesting - especially at a startup or a more nimble company. Jobs like these:
http://tapwage.com/channel/if-you-start-me-up-if-you-start-me-up-ill-never-stop
http://tapwage.com/channel/unicorn-business-developer

Alternatively, you could look at ad-sales if you have the experience. Its not like direct sales at all and can be a lot more fun and lucrative. Jobs like these:
http://tapwage.com/channel/selling-eyeballs

Finally - you could also look at more B2B / enterprise sales. These are very lucrative and are completely different than direct sales / home improvement sales but leverage your background. But many of these require some specific skill sets / experience so might be hard to get.

 Given how much data science is in fashion, depending on the city, there should be no reason to take a significant payout. Your engineering background will definitely help, as will the fact that you are learning Python and R. But as NotARandomNumber points out, it depends on location. NY, LA, SF, DC are much likely to pay 100k+ than some of the smaller cities.

A few ideas for you:
Data science is a misleading category since that typically involves a PhD. There are a ton of great data and analytics roles out there that don't involve PhD but they aren't always labelled data science

Here are some data and analytics jobs in finance / large banks that you could consider:

http://tapwage.com/channel/artificial-intelligence-meets-financial-intelligence

You could also consider data analytical positions at large corporations (ignore the MBA in the title. MBA is preferred but they are open to quant degrees)

http://tapwage.com/channel/data-driven-mbas-at-big-corporates

Look at operational jobs that specifically value military and naval backgrounds. These can be wide ranging, very interesting and are increasingly strategic and analytical. Examples of such jobs is here:

http://tapwage.com/channel/operating-with-military-precision

May of these will also consider and reward your engineering background
Let me know if you are looking for something more specific with your background and I can try to point you in the right direction. Good luck! 









 Thats a really difficult situation with loans. My #1 advice would be to create a compelling portfolio of writing samples that you can customize for various jobs. 

If you are struggling to get a gig at a big media outlet, try and get a foot in the door with a digital media startup (there are so many out there these days and they are hiring aggressively). 

here is a set of journalism jobs. If you get your foot in the door at a place like Vox or one of the other digital media entities, the pay isn't great out of the gate, but depending on where you life it might allow your friend to cut down to just 1 full time job. Gives you a chance to build a public portfolio, get some visibility and navigate into a more serious journalism role down the line. 
http://tapwage.com/channel/reporting-the-news  




 You don't need a liberal arts degree. You just need to write well. If you want to be a journalist, you should, and there are a number of business journalist jobs out there in both traditional media publications / TV outlets and new digital media outlets. 

Look at these jobs here:
http://tapwage.com/searchresult?keyword=business+reporter location=

or this journalism collection here:
http://tapwage.com/channel/reporting-the-news

These jobs generally don't require journalist degrees. They just need good writing samples which hopefully you have. 

Moreover, there are very few reporters with real understanding of accounting and finance so you could leverage your background to give you a leg up by writing about M A, finance, business etc. I would add these to your writing samples so you really stand out for some of these jobs. Good luck! 









 I read it as he jumped in the river to save a drowning frog. That would have been even more impressive.  





























 Export its culture through its TV, film and brands. People all over the world aspire to the american lifestyle because of what they see on TV and at the movies.  




 That is exactly why he should get the cool haircut. So he has an awesome memory to look back on and laugh at. I love looking at photos of my parents from the 70s and 80s exactly because they are time stamped by the fashions of their day and I hope one day when I look back at photos from today, I can say, aaah "rocking it in 2015" 




 Also - I eventually bought a few packets of these:

 If you want to strike the right balance, I think rather than doing a lot of different types of programming languages (C++, Java, etc), you are better off focusing on a single type of programming and building some depth. Sometimes the easiest to pick up, and often the easiest to demonstrate to an employer is web development. So my recommendation would be to focus on a single area and do a project on that. Either contribute to an open source project on github, or build a practical app. 

Its often easier to code when you feel a sense of accomplishment and doing classes or tutorials on C++ 101 etc, rarely gives that sense of accomplishment and doesn't particularly stand out on a resume to an employer. Whether you are doing app or web development, maybe its better to do a small project that you can deploy, perhaps in combination with your networking / infrastructure skills, and that becomes a valuable thing to show as your body of work and will make you much more employable.  




 All the time. Not just shows, there are so many movies I haven't watched yet (all the summer releases so far), so many TV shows (still haven't watched Breaking Bad, Sopranos, Walking Dead, OITNB), still need to get to podcasts (ReplyAll, etc.), have 1000s of items waiting on my instapaper queue. 

I think I'll have a lot of fun when I retire in 30 years. 

There is too much great content and I am not sure how everything will find audiences.  




 This especially happens when people are meeting either someone senior or a in a position of power (like a CEO, senior manager or something, or a celebrity). My point is a) what could they possibly say in a few minutes that would make them seem smart and b) even if they were freaking Einstein, are you really smart enough to assess that yourself. We just end up further elevating people who are in power and / or are articulate 




 After reading HP, I have always wondered why instead of selling digital photo frames, they don't sell digital gif frames, so we can have gifs of people waving or chatting or enjoying themselves instead of just still photos.

 Hi - As I wrote in my other response to DiggDejected's similar post on /r/spam, I am hoping to rehabilitate this account and will cease the activities that made you think I was spamming the community. I hope for a second chance for me and the tapwage domain 




 Hi - I understand your concern that I appear to be spamming the community. I intend to cease those activities, and would like to rehabilitate this account.

 This sounds really grim. Your best bet is to find a new job because even when you get promoted, there will another issue for the next promotion. This company sounds culturally broken with poor incentives. 

The other issue is that your manager might just not be honest with you. Managers, especially in technology who don't have a ton of managerial experience, sometimes don't know how to give feedback, and so will tell employees that they are doing great work when they might not be.  This might not be the case with you, but you should try and get feedback from multiple sources. If your output is indeed double and high quality, find a new company.  




 The kindle is so much easier to read and much lighter. I am amazed OP reads eBooks on Macbook Pro. Thats really hard ergonomically. 

One option is to use the "night" options on apps. e.g. Instapaper ad others come with a "night" mode where they turn the background black and the text white. I find that a lot easier to read.  




 What about Dick? 
























 A lot of police harassment doesn't happen with speeding or traffic violations but with simple things like broken tail-lights, or expired registration tags. Sadly a self-driving car is unlikely to be a self-fixing one.  




 you mean Donald :) 




 You seem like you have a ton of solid operating experience. I would imagine that if you study finance, you could perhaps translate that into an operating role at a larger company and build a career from there. 

If you really like programming, you could get a software degree but without a lot of programming experience, it may be hard to get a great software job and your experience doesn't really back it up.

Perhaps after the finance degree you could look at a startup role where you can blend your operating and software skill sets better but with the limited info here, my take would be to get a degree in finance / econ.

 Avoid it but always be really nice and have a really good relationship with all the assistants. Thats the fastest way gossip spreads and they are surprisingly influential. Be really nice to everyone but especially them (which in the stress of the workplace people sometimes forget to do), and it will make your life a ton easier.   




 This list has great ideas. A few more:
quantitative modeler
Data developer
Data analytics
Marketing science
Predictive modeler

In fact searching for "data science" often leads people to the wrong results when they are in fact looking for jobs with analytics / statistics. 




 Research using sites like NYbits (not sure where you are looking for but I am sure there are similar sites in other cities). These tell you what prior rents were and complains by former tenants.

Others have captured most of the things to look for. One thing that is a game changer is a dishwasher. You'll be surprised how much easier that makes your life so if you can get a place with a dishwasher - give that props.  



















 Add peri peri salt on anything - from roasted vegetables to roast chicken. 




 Fair point. I wasn't thinking that through. 




 I can foresee a few potential changes:
1. Much more even distribution of humans across the globe as the perils of sea navigation decrease substantially. E.g. North America may have been settled by people from Africa and Asia given that the perils of travel would have been meaningfully reduced

2. Remote island archipelagos would also be meaningfully more settled

3. Titanic would have clearly been a much smaller tragedy, but more importantly, the survival of influential rich aristrocats like JJ Astor could have significantly changed recent business history

4. Coming back to #1, meaningfully more trade that started earlier could have significantly changed culture and food. E.g. ancient civilizations like Mesopotamia, Greece and Indus Valley may have intermingled more, and survived longer as a result creating more continuous history

Perhaps investment and innovation would be more on naval and sea-faring capabilities and less on terrestrial conquest. This could have political ramifications for sure (more colonization, less inter-country fighting in Europe), but also delay innovations like rail travel and air travel in favor of water based innovations

What I am not sure of is whether this would substantially decrease the historical advantage had by early adopters to agriculture. Would fishing really enjoy a substantial advantage is unclear to me. If it did, you could conceive a situation where coastal fishing economies could balance out the power of agricultural economies. Not sure the implications of that though.  




 You should politely respond with "I really appreciate the offer. I am very keen to take up the internship and work for you, but given that I have to move to do this internship - this will be very hard for me to do with this offer given that this will barely cover my rent". Be very polite and stick to the facts.

Be open to ideas they have. Perhaps they can help get you subsidized accommodation, or can offer you an end of summer bonus if you get an offer. Assuming this is a job you want, they might have other ways to make you whole. 

But only have this conversation if you are fairly sure you are ready to walk away if they don't budge since at the internship level, companies are usually less willing to negotiate.  




 So Annie are you ok? 




 Well there is a lot of things you can do with hands like that! 




 Game of Thrones. That way I can manage the topic four different ways:
1. You've seen the show but haven't read the books???? The books are w-aaay better
2. You've read the books but haven't seen the show???? The storyline is diverging and the show is getting really interesting. Plus boobies
3. You've read the books and seen the show? Isn't it amazing??!! Do you think the Dany will make it to Westeros? 
4. You haven't read the books or watched the show???? Here I'll tell you all about it whether you like it or not

 Exactly. and having a compelling narrative is too often misconstrued as having the right narrative. This mixes badly with peoples inherent biases when talking to someone in a position of power.  




 Not invest it. 10k invested at 5% return per year in 20 years is 25k. In 30 years its 42k. I was lazy for a long time and left any savings I had in cash and didn't even bother putting in a CD or an index-fund or anything, and on hindsight that was the worst thing I did with my money.  




 well done Asoiaf nerd! 




 :) observing your short response, I just know that you are exceedingly smart as well.  
























 If browser wasn't an option, I would say camera. I wouldn't mind carrying an iPad /kindle around for reading, and small radio for music, but to carry around a point and shoot is way too clunky.

and you know what - that kinda describes the evolution of the mobile phone. Camera was almost universally the first feature added after calls and texts.  




 Candidly - you can't cram for such an interview. Also if you do get the job by pretending to know 12+ technologies, you are just setting yourself up for failure on the job which can be detrimental to your reputation in the long run.

Brush up on the 4-5 things you know and make sure you come across really strong and confident in those areas. If they probe on the other areas - be clear and confident that although you aren't up to speed on the other topics - you are a fast learner, are eager to contribute and build a skill set and be a positive force at the job.

Our best bet is coming across as earnest, hardworking and very knowledgable at the things you do know. Sometimes the most powerful thing to say in an interview is "I am not skilled at that but I intend to learn it very quickly and have experience with other similar technologies today". If you try and fake it, you will get caught out either at the interview, or later on the job.  

Good luck.  









 I never really appreciated him until I saw The Grand Budapest Hotel. And then I had to go back and see all his films. The visuals are just stunning.

 I agree with your point. I have used those tools and the quality of international engineers is a huge positive surprise. Its no where near as good as working side by side with someone but as collaboration tools get better and better, it's much easier to work with someone really talented in Eastern Europe or Asia (I find Latam / Eastern Europe easier from a timezone perspective than Asia)

So the bigger worry than H1Bs is really these tools (odesk / upwork) becoming more mainstream and moving up the value chain, and unlike H1B's which are regulated strongly, there is no way to protect an American workforce from technological changes like this.

The only way forward has to be continued and easy access to training and education. 

In all the focus on STEM majors by the tech world and increasingly by politicians, what is forgotten is that the US has some of the best liberal arts schools in the world, and the combination of the humanities and technology is potent. Other countries can easy produce great programmers, but they are unlikely to produce great technologists in the same volume with a well-rounded, broad-based skill set. 

The path forward for the US cannot be purely STEM but access to STEM+business / arts / design / humanities in a high quality, easy and affordable way.

The biggest outsourcing worry we have is that college is way too expensive and delivers too little value for the money. 

 




 I appreciate the sentiment but the shower thought I wish you had was  - why do countries and imaginary boundaries matter any more. Patriotism is just a false hangover from the high of abdicating our own responsibilities to professional leaders.

 Valyrian steel?! 

Just kidding thats fictional but the idea for Valerian steel in GoT / Asoiaf is from Damascus steel which no one has still been able to reproduce perfectly today:

 Candidly - not really. The 1.5 years is just a guideline. I think it looks bad if you leave a job too early, and you miss out on the chance to really evaluate the job / company. Don't fret on the exact number of months, but make sure you feel like you can talk to a holistic experience at that job.  




 I can suggest the following rule-of-thumb:
1. If you have already done more than a 1.5 years in your current job, you should always be looking. Doesn't have to mean sending your resume out to 100s of other companies, but look at the job sites and see what piques your interest. This regular market check makes sure you aren't just staying out of inertia.
2. Before that period - its too early to judge a job or a company (unless its downright nasty)

Rule of thumb 3 (assuming you are competent at your current job and the issues you describe aren't performance related as it sounds like from your post) - push for more responsibility. As in take it on - don't ask. Pioneer a special project that the company needs badly but no one has gotten around to take ownership (large companies have tons of those), try and take the initiative. If you feel like that is getting noticed and appreciated, and as a result you are enjoying the job more - its a good place to be. If you feel like people are resistant, you are getting more questions than support - then its time to leave.

I have absolutely stayed at a company too long. And sometimes the job gets different, but not better but it "feels" like its better. I have found only when I push for more responsibility and try and take charge of my career, I get a sense for the real values / culture of the company and then my decision is clear. 




 Love this story and this idea! Don't love the idea of having to read the book on China's communist readers (sounds a little dense but probably better than I am imagining)

 Exit Through the Gift Shop 




 Unclear why this is in personal finance.

It's hard to give you advice without understanding the gravity of what you have done. Let's say you were snooping around the internal systems and deleted a bunch of critical files that could create significant financial issues for the company. What should you do then?

My take - come clean. Tell them how you stumbled on those files and the mistake you made, and the ramifications. Offer to help rectify the situation. Offer to make it up to them financially by working hard. 

They might fire you. If what you did was of the sort that I suggested, then they should reassess their internal policies and security. They might be glad that you came forward and just reprimand you.

I think you will be glad you came forward and came clean. Assuming what you did was not a criminal act, but the mistake of someone with little work experience, then it's not the end of the world. Find someone you trust at this work place to be a reference, and start applying for other jobs. 

Leaving without owning up doesn't help them, and doesn't help you (unless what you did was criminal). 

Good luck.  




 I did 5 years of long distance across 2 continents. I then moved in with her 5 years ago and married her 2 years ago, and feel like the luckiest guy ever. 

3 pieces of advice:
1. Use every piece of communication available. We used text message, FaceTime, Skype, email, written mail, Facebook pokes, everything...if we could send smoke signals, we would have. 

2. Have a routine to talk to each other every day and make an effort to be available.

3. Depending on where you are, traveling to see each other can get expensive, so plan in advance, and try and make the visits equitable.

Good luck! 



















 Keep it simple. Rent / borrow a projector and a good sound system, invite all the fun people you know - have a movie marathon, or a board game night - or both. Host a giant pajama party 




 You could:

1. Cook an elaborate meal without people getting in the way / asking you what you are making, etc.

2. Host your own "The Real World" reality TV show and put it up on YouTube, and try and become an internet sensation

3. Spin on 2 - use it to make your own music video  - or MTV cribs episode

4. Make a haunted mansion, charge folks admission - make some dough

5. Start your own pop-up store. Try the idea out with your free real estate, if it works - you know what you can do over summer

6. Epic game of laser tag

7. List the place. Have an open house. As potential buyers inappropriate questions.

8. Get pets!!

 









 Has to be the Trojans losing. People are still talking about it 1000s of years later.  
























 In my awful bachelor apartment which I shared with 2 other guys.  














 Santa Claus. 

But seriously - history is the biggest lie I've ever been told cuz we are told it over and over again. When I read "People's History of the United States", I was blown away. I don't think that Howard Zinn's version of history is necessarily right, but the idea that there is a single narrative that explains how we got here is definitely wrong, and everything I learned and believed in was based on a homogeneous narrative. So history is the biggest lie I've been told.  









 I just went ahead, bought another apartment and another car. Have TWC at home but got Fios there - you can't be too careful. My fapping routine involves changing into my fap  clothes, driving my fab-mobile, to my fap-apartment, firing up my new modem, watching it on my fap-puter, taking a shower, and then heading back to the wife. You just can't be too careful with these things. If I get caught, it could be so embarrassing.  




 I would generally disclose a range where the low end of the range is where you would settle for a job, and the high end is potentially 10-20% above that. Don't disclose your current salary unless you trust that headhunter or staffing agency, but giving a range of what you would move for (which would be typically higher than your current comp) is normal.

To other questions - I would be generally honest, with a grain of salt. If you are really unhappy at your current workplace, don't bitch to the headhunter. Be somewhat candid at your reasons for looking for a new job and the type of job you are looking for, but don't say anything that if it came back to your current employer would leave you mortified. 
 




 This was the original flash sales site and was always so much fun. The site still exists but its just not the same any more. Ever since Amazon bought it, there is no witty writing, no punchline, nothing. No bags of crap. I know those guys started another site that is similar to woot, but its not the same. I miss woot.  









 I used to be on the West Coast and now am on the East Coast for many years. Shake Shack is not an in-an-out equivalent. Its a much higher end product at a much higher end cost. Agree with you that its much better than Five Guys but In-n-out is much more "for the people". Also Shake Shack recently IPOd so its too early to say that it has the reputation of quality over money relative to In-n-Out. 

Also In-n-Out has a secret menu that puts everyone else to shame.  




 In-n-Out is a good example of a company forgoing long term growth so they wouldn't compromise their product and user experience. There are other such examples - Basecamp / 37 signals from which Ruby on Rails came out of. Craigslist is another example where he could have sold for a massive amount but chose not to.

There is Quora that for years on end has run with no monetization and it is unclear if there will ever be monetization. 

Finally - there are "B-corps". Benefit corps that are for-profit companies that are also specifically focused on sustainability and community values. These are companies like Easy, Warby Parker, and many others. I am not 100% sure that this doesn't end up mocked like Google's "don't be evil" clause, but the B-corp certification from B-Lab is fairly difficult and intense to get. 
 









 One of them would be the Russian commander during the Cuban missile crisis who prevented the launch of nuclear missiles and saved the world: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasili_Arkhipov

But part of me almost believes in the Psychohistorian approach proposed by Isaac Asimov in the Foundation series where historical figures are all actors in the evolution of the world. If they didn't exist, someone else would step into their place. Hitler the man was a catalyst in a country deeply impacted by WWI and with a deep racial divide. Gandhi was a leader who united a country but it only hastened the weakening of an already weakened colonial state.   

Shakespeare developed art, and language almost single-handedly but his absence would have led people to read other great writers of that time and language would not be impacted, just different.  




 5 things go into any good cover letter:
First para: A short 2 sentence about you and how you heard about this opportunity
Second para: Why are you excited about this role
Third para: Why your experiences in comedy are perfect for this job - you are both a writer but have standup experience so understand the delivery as well as comedic writing. You love sketch and standup comedy and can bring both experiences to bear. 
Fourth para: What do you see as unique about the Conan show and this job and how that mixes perfectly with who you are. (Down-to-earth show that has never been scared to innovate. Pioneers in web video. You aren't just a writer looking for a brand name gig but a chance to work at a place on TV where writers are looking to try new concepts across media)
Last para - you are very excited and would love to share your writing samples with the. and a quick polite finish.

Keep it simple. I have never applied for a comedy job so I am guessing it might help to be funny, but have someone else (not you or your gf review it) so you are sure the humor travels and isn't misconstrued.

Good luck and get on that television! 




 Thanks for this. I was scared out of my mind when I had my first fender bender. It was a light one but it felt like a massive accident, the way the car shook and the whiplash.

The crazy, disorienting part was when we pulled over and the lady was shaken up and apologetic - someone came and offered her a phone number so she can call them as witness in case I tried to extort her for money. Granted my car was an old beat up one, but I was just so upset that I got rammed into and then I was made to feel like the person in the wrong.  




 Sure thing, and good luck. If helpful check out tapwage.com which has a lot of junior software / IT / MIS jobs at non-tech firms.  Feel free to ping me if you have any follow up questions 









 If you have an interest in pursuing MIS work as opposed to IT / software engineering work - then you are better off going to a non-technology company. So a bank, hospital, healthcare company or any other type of regular large company is your best bet. You will get a chance to learn about more than just software and systems and actually see processes. You could even go to the finance and reporting team at one of those companies  - since many such finance roles exist and that expands the potential scope of your career into data and analytics type roles. If your IT skills are primarily in Microsoft products as it seems to be, this is another indicator that you are better off applying to a large and medium sized non-tech firm than a tech firm. 


Salary depends significantly on where you are based and what specific development experience you have. It sounds like you have  a number of skills but perhaps not a lot of dev experience. So unless you are in SF, LA, NY - chances are your salary range is on the lower end of the range you provided. In those cities, you can sort of expect a salary in the middle of that range but it really depends on your actual dev experience. 

Finally - certifications again depend on where you want to take your career. If you see yourself in a IT / tech role at a non-tech company, Microsoft certifications can help get your foot in the door but not a lot of value beyond that. You are better of investing your time doing internships or projects that let you actually get dev experience.  





























 There are a lot of skills and experiences that you can parse and structure well. It partly depends on whether you have effectively identified what types of jobs in the corporate world you think you are qualified for. 

So I think the bigger question is identifying exactly what you are well suited for within the corporate landscape, and then tailoring your resume / recruitment for that switch.

You can check out a site like tapwage.com to see what types of jobs there are at both large corporations or startups that might translate to your specific interests and skills. After that you really want to tailor your resume as closely to the job postings as possible, especially given the use of resume screening software / ATS.

If you have a very non-traditional background, you could perhaps specifically look at startups that are more open to that background (also are unlikely to use ATS / resume screening software so gives you more of a chance to tell your story). 

Targeting categories of jobs and companies is key to a successful transition in your case. The way you portray your specific experiences falls out of that.   




 1. Try and give them real projects with real responsibilities instead of just training / demo projects or shadowing full time employees, or rotating through a lot of groups. Ideally - projects are weekly, with end of week check-ins, and a chance to discuss work at Monday morning meetings. This is critical to make them feel a part of the time and get a sense of what the job is actually like full-time

2. If possible, have them seated in a large bull-pen or conference room together. The camaraderie is important and they end up teaching each other a ton and getting up to speed much faster than if seated separately across the office.

3. Goes without saying that mid-internship reviews are important but also important to be very candid during these sessions so they get a real measure of performance. Ideally do this at the 40% mark (since the last week or so of internships aren't really very active)

4. Again, probably obvious but activities outside the office help a lot - whether its a bowling event or volunteering. But it's only effective if you get full-time employees there across levels, so get that buy-in early.

5. I have found formal "mentor" programs very ineffective, and tried them in a  range of formats (junior mentors, senior mentors, peer mentors). Interns tend to find their own mentors and as long as they are on projects with real responsibility, they do ok. 

6. Meals are important and often that's a way to integrate them into the firm and spur conversations. If your office doesn't typically eat together in the office, may require planning to either create opportunities for them to do meals together with other employees (less formal than typical intern brown bag lunches though). 
 




 Both are determined, super smart and capable. My guess is Arya because she has actually killed before, and especially with the training she received at the temple of the many faced god.

 You won't be able to share your code from the current job but you will be able to talk to your skills and experiences, and a large enterprise app will probably much more valuable in an interview process than side projects (although you should always pursue side projects if you can, to keep sharp).

While on this large project, don't make the rookie mistake of sticking in a corner and not paying attention to how things get put together. Pay attention to what different teams are doing, how they work together, how unit and regression testing is conducted, how version control and builds are managed, how user provisioning is managed, how programming teams interface with database administration and infrastructure teams. Volunteer, take an interest, demonstrate initiative. That will really help you understand the guts of a large enterprise deployment and help you shine in a future interview. Taking that initiative will help you much more in future interviews and job applications than using a few hours a week to develop test applications. 

Moreover, if you just started work in May 2015, give it some time before you start worrying about your next job. Ideally give it a year or two and get yourself settled. Applying too soon to a new job could easily hurt your chances as you will be seen as not being a team player or not having a strong skill set (there will be concerns that you didn't cut it in your current job). 

Good luck.  









 It's hard to pick just 5.  




 Damn - I wish I had Beatles, Dre and Queen on my list too.  




 I would want that list to be as diverse as possible so I capture a wide range of musical choices. And each of them would need to have a really big discography to make it worth it. So my list would be:

1. Oasis (for rock)
2. Joe Purdy (for folk) [So torn on whether him or Paul Simon or Dylan]
3. Daft Punk (for dance)
4. Yo Yo Ma (for classical)
5. Michael Jackson (for pop)

This reminds me of the BBC radio show / podcast called "Desert Island Discs" which I love. It makes celebrities / writers choose 8 tracks that they would take with them to a desert island. Their choices often reveal so much more about them than a plain interview would. 
 









 Jay Leno. Seriously - who really likes one liners any more?  




 me too! I think he is very poignant and makes me think but just isn't funny to me. I much prefer Carlin, Chappelle or Chris Rock when it comes to interspersing social commentary and comedy.  




 Put the python related projects on your resume. Put them on github and then you can link to them. At least it's a talking point that demonstrates your initiative when it comes to computer science. Way too many computer science graduates go through school without doing anything outside of their core curriculum requirements.

In terms of open source, you need to build your way up. I am not sure what types of projects you have done using the Reddit API but perhaps you can find other related projects on github and try contributing to those repositories.  Projects where you get to work with other developers, and someone else codebase can be especially rewarding.

I would strongly advise you not to approach all these projects with the mindset of "what would look good on my resume". Follow your curiosity and find projects that interest you, whether its an app to solve a problem you have had, or helping with a small patch to a piece of software you use, or if you are just looking to see how larger projects work in the real world. Following your interests will take you to surprising places, give you real depth and that will show in your interviews. Padding your resume with projects just for the sake of your resume might work in the near term but it won't make you a bette programmer and worse, it might get you to stop enjoying programming.
  




 This reminds me of one of my favorite songs from Flight of the Conchord  - hiphopopotamus vs. rhymenoceros, where Brett says:

"Yes, sometimes my lyrics are sexist
But you lovely bitches and hoes should know I'm trying to correct this"

I love that show.

 Little Sebastian! 














 Bieber is pretty polarizing but has a huge community.  




 haha! yeah, second hand smoke stunts growth though.  









 Sidewalks aren't large enough and second hand smoke is awful. Find a secluded spot, and for goodness sake, don't smoke near a bus stop or some place where people have to wait and can't avoid the smoke.  









 I was in a cab the other day and the driver looked stressed as all hell. Told me that he levered up to buy the medallion at $1 million thinking it was the safest investment he could make, and immediately after, the price fell to $500k. He needed to declare personal bankruptcy. It was heartbreaking to hear.  




 Just suggest a call and find out what types of roles they have on offer. Might be spam, might be useful. Worth 10 minutes over the phone but would avoid an in-person meeting right away.  



















 so is "Let's just agree to disagree" 







































 Start simple. and start tangible.

I highly recommend ditching Java and starting with a web framework like RoR or Php Yii. They are quick, you can make a fun web app and get the hang of MVC. That way you learn a little bit of front end and a little bit of back end. You'll have time in college to get more depth, but start out with breadth. 

Build a simple blog tutorial to start (there are tons), get familiar with mysql or sqlite and get your hands wet with a linux dev environment. 

That should take you a month tops. Then you can start tinkering with specific areas. Maybe customize a wordpress blog yourself. Or maybe plug into some APIs like Twitter and see if you can make something interesting. 

And then head over to odesk / upwork and do a little bit freelance work. Php / RoR skills are sought after and you can start low (~$10-15 / hr and work your way to $30-40 / hr if you are good)

Good luck. 





























 yes, mention it BUT:
- be careful of the space it takes up
- customize your resume for the two different jobs. So for the software job, talk about your hardware startup but describe a sentence or two on any embedded software / drivers / etc that you may have worked on to make the solution work. i.e., describe it as a solution as opposed to hardware
- For the audio hardware job, give that more room - make it front and center and go into the technologies in more detail. 




 I agree with medical transcriptionist over front desk assistant. But it doesnt pay very well and you don't need a college degree to do it. 

My suggestion is to look for a clinical role or a junior finance role at a (large) healthcare organization. That will generally be a structured position with a lot of guidance, let you work without a ton of client interaction, and have a career path where if you get good at what you do, you can get senior and see a path to making decent money.

Look at these jobs: http://tapwage.com/searchresult?SearchForm%5Bwhat%5D=healthcare+finance+analyst SearchForm%5Bwhere%5D=

Something like this job: https://xerox.taleo.net/careersection/xerox_shared_external_portal/jobdetail.ftl?job=15018289 lang=en

You could even look at entry-level research / library management jobs. 

Like this job: https://careers.insidehighered.com/yale-university/research-and-education-librarian-focus-public-health-gis/jobs/676703

Or this set of jobs:
http://tapwage.com/searchresult?SearchForm%5Bwhat%5D=health+librarian SearchForm%5Bwhere%5D=


Or look at underwriter / financial analyst jobs. Like this job:
https://jobs.healthnet.com/job/Woodland-Hills-Underwriter-%28Entry-level%29-CA-91367/273842800/

Hope that helps. 

  




 Look for entry level clinical jobs at big biotech / pharma cos. A biochemistry background can be really helpful and a path to either a scientific career or a business one. Your research experience will come in handy as well. Those jobs pay well out of the gate and have great career prospects as you build experience.

Look at some jobs here:
http://tapwage.com/channel/medicine-maker

Jobs like clinical trial support specialists would be a good starting point given your background and experience. You have a good GPA so that will help too.

You could also apply for research assistant jobs at companies / research labs:
http://tapwage.com/searchresult?SearchForm%5Bwhat%5D=research+assistant SearchForm%5Bwhere%5D=

These are good places to build some scientific lab experience and again gives you a path to either go to graduate school or enter pharma. These jobs don't pay as well though

 Thanks will do. Am sensitive to cross posting because every now and then a user flags me for spamming and that's not my intention. 

Separately - the site has a lot of curated marketing channels cut different ways: http://tapwage.com/?field=%5B13%5D

If you follow the channels you like, you can be updated with new jobs since the channels are updated daily. 

Hope that helps! 




 These are curated, daily-updated channels that are extensively filtered for fake / spammy jobs. Glad you found it useful.  




 Thank you! Will check all these out. I love this subreddit.  




 Thanks for those tips. I have gotten into Passenger recently but haven't noticed the trumpets. I do like Iron   wine but they are always so sad.  




 I recently discovered the band Beirut. Blew me away. I love Elephant Gun, East Harlem, and so many other songs of theirs. So three questions for the community:
a) What's your favorite Beirut song?
b) Are there other bands like them that combine the trumpet / brass with rock / folk music and great song writing? 









 yes. This is automatically updated every day. If you follow the channel, you can be alerted of new jobs added every week.  














 It sounds really rough that after all these years of experience, you aren't able to take any meaningful leave and sick days. You seem very disciplined, organized and experienced so there are multiple jobs that you could potentially try for that might be easier / pay you more.

Question - does "some college" mean that you went to college but didn't graduate? Unfortunately you won't get a lot of credit for that.

So here are a few choices of jobs you could consider:

1. Office manager jobs - basically looking for highly organized people. Many are open to people without college degrees but adequate work experience. Jobs are like these:
http://tapwage.com/channel/the-office-linchpin

2. There are culinary director jobs at startups and companies that will allow you to leverage your skill, but these are at companies that tend to have better benefit packages and leave plans and more of a career path: http://tapwage.com/searchresult?SearchForm%5Bwhat%5D=culinary+director SearchForm%5Bwhere%5D=

3. You could also consider becoming a bank teller / personal banker. That may be a stretch since it forces you to start somewhat at a more entry-level position. If you can get a job directly as a personal banker accounting for your experience, you could potentially make a similar pay as you are making now, and have a career path that is more sustainable and more enjoyable. You probably have the people skills to be great at it. But being a bank teller at entry level won't work since it will take you back to the $30k mark that will be hard.

4. if you like tech / startups / video games, you could try and get a job in customer experience / customer adoption. These are interesting jobs where you aren't doing sales but walking large customers through early adoption of a new technology. It's kinda fun. Only catch is that most of these are in big cities so you could make the same pay but end up spending more on living expenses.

What about something like a restaurant operations consultant? Large food companies like US foods have these jobs and they seem perfect for you. 
https://usfood.taleo.net/careersection/usf_external/jobdetail.ftl?job=15002747 lang=en

The link is just an example. With your experience you should be able to get at least a similar starting pay but with better benefits and a better career path. 
 














 Hey - firstly congrats on not having student debt, and I feel for you on the job search struggles. 

In the absence of a lot more information, I am bound to agree with the advice that grad school isn't going to magically solve the problems. It sounds like the bigger problem is a lack of focus on specifically what you want to apply to, and perhaps you need help tailoring your resume. 

Check out some of the jobs here: 

http://tapwage.com/searchresult?SearchForm%5Bwhat%5D=physics+recent+graduate SearchForm%5Bwhere%5D=

A few are for entry-level math and and physics graduates, and most don't need extensive programming experience.

Are you sending the same resume to all these 30 positions? That's a mistake if you are. Also have you had a few people look at and critique your resume? Finally - are you just cold applying or actively trying to connect / network into the organizations. Have you been invited to any interviews?

Firstly - 30 applications is not a lot so don't lose patience. Secondly - before you opt for grad school (which may or may not be an excellent decision), you need to find out exactly why you aren't getting interviews / jobs. If you aren't getting interviews - chances are you aren't finding the right jobs, and your resume is probably not up to scratch. So get a career coach and get that in order. 

If you are getting interviews but aren't making it through - then you need to get to the bottom of why that's the case.

Whatever you decide vis. a vis. grad school - get to the bottom of why you aren't finding success at the job hunt. The market is still not great for recent graduates, especially in physics and math, so it might take some time, but have patience and potentially evaluate getting a career coach to help.  
























 Dating for Dummies...(j/k)

I don't mind books whose fundamental points I disagree with (say Mein Kempf, or Ayn Rand). Many people I know read and own books they vehemently disagree with without which they feel ill equipped to argue the other side. 

I mind fluff books that pretend to be intellectual that aren't. Examples:
- Books by Malcolm Gladwell
- Books by Thomas Friedman (except 'From Beirut to Jerusalem')
 




 I get reading. I get owning. But why highlight, unless you had to direct the film (and even then it's a weak excuse) 




 They aren't inaccessible. It's just that one their own, they lack popular front-end frameworks to rapid prototype an application that you can use. 

I think if you are learning programming for the first time, especially outside of a college environment  - it's really fulfilling when you can build a real live application that solves an itch you have and is fun to use. That can be a huge high that leads you to build on the skill and get better.

It's a little bit like learning a musical instrument for the first time. If you spend the first 6 months just playing scales back and forth, it gets dull and people tend to lose interest, but the minute you learn that first tune, you are hooked. Suddenly you aren't playing an instrument, you are making music that you recognize as music.

The same goes with programming. The sooner you move away from learning coding, and start to build something you can play with, you get hooked.

Python and C++ are fantastic programs. I especially loved C++. Maybe with something like C++, you could learn openGL / Unity / Unreal and make a cool game or something. I used to enjoy using C++ for image processing (but I admit it was because of a class I took and not self driven). Perhaps you are exceptionally curious and driven and use those languages to build out something amazing. With Python - you could even use learn Django and end up making a cool web app.

But if you are starting out coding in your 20s, then start with PHP / Yii and build a simple blog. Then figure out how to integrate it with or extend Wordpress, and add little features and hooks. 

If you do that, programming ceases to be a series of obscure incantations that you offer up to a computing black box, and suddenly becomes the lego building blocks to a new and tangible universe.

 




 In high school way back in the 90s, it was offered as an elective. We learnt basic on MS Dos machines. 

One of the problems with programs like Python and C++ is that it's hard to use those languages to scratch an easy itch (unless your itch is more computational). 

These days, as am amateur programmer, it's almost better to learn Objective-C / Swift, or PHP / Ruby on Rails. That way you build something relatively quickly, a web app or a mobile app, and you actually use it. So if you hated all the existing to-do lists, you build one. Or if you want to port your music from spotify to apple music, you quickly make an app and share it with your friends. 

Once you are done with a few things like that which give you a sense of accomplishment, then head on over to github and see if there are projects you can contribute to, patches you can submit, and start picking up something more unstructured (and consequently more powerful) like C++ / Python to see if you can build something cooler.

Actually one of the most fun projects I remember (and I can't for the life of me remember its name), was this league where you could build a AI-engine to play football against other teams. That was a really fun task to do as a beginner coding project.  




 60k seems high for entry-level North Carolina software jobs. To be fair - there are a lots of flavors for software jobs and even entry-level job pay-grades are standardized based on skill set. Where did you find that number, or is that anecdotal from friends?

Also - although RH will help you and take a cut if they succeed in finding you a job you like, that doesn't compel you not to look for jobs on your own. Feel free to cast your net wide and see if you cn find a better offer and if RH finds you a job you think compelling, take that. 

In general, headhunters will commit to salaries a little lower than market to manage your expectations. What they are quoting you may be disappointing but it isn't wildly off. Focus on knocking the socks off your interviewers and nailing a great job whether you get it through RH or on your own.

But most importantly - you need to base your salary info on real data and skills and not anecdotal evidence. If you know companies that are paying $60k+, then apply there.
 

















































 Glad I could help. Pm me if you have trouble finding Junior HR roles. Sales sounds intimidating but it's not that bad really but understand your reticence on that front.  




 Try and get an entry-level job in public relations / communications. Your writing experience will help immensely and there is a career path there. You could also consider a career in HR. 

1. There are a lot of entry-level jobs here:
http://tapwage.com/searchresult?SearchForm%5Bwhat%5D=entry+level SearchForm%5Bwhere%5D=

Look at the ones in sales, or project management

2. here is a list of junior HR jobs:
http://tapwage.com/channel/talent-acquisition-rookies

3. Junior ad sales could be an interesting opportunity:
http://tapwage.com/channel/selling-eyeballs

With your credentials, and openness to moving, you will likely be able to find a job if you try but you may need a pick a few areas and zoom in. Picking a field like HR, PR or sales is a good one because it gives you a career path as opposed to a job given that you are tired of doing lots of different gigs and starting over.  




 I totally understand how you feel. If you are at a  large firm that is on the downturn, older employees who have been there longer can get a little political and insecure when they see a younger employee "over-do" it or try to show that they are working hard. That's not to say that thats the case in this situation - it's very possible that you are misreading their general insecurities as resentment. 

To stay on good-terms with your coworkers:
1. Be helpful. Try and make sure you are a team player. Maybe its me but reading your posts and comments, I get the feeling that you are measuring output in lines of code you produce rather than projects you help your team accomplish. Software engineering is a team sport so make sure you are focused on the teams objectives instead of just your own part of the puzzle. You will learn more that way too.

2. Stop measuring your output in term of time either.  Having been  code for a long time and worked with developers - beyond 40-50 hours a week, hours spent is rarely correlated with quality of work. If you want to learn more and be more valuable - spend the time learning the bigger objectives of the project /company and use your down time to research / get smarter and help with those objectives. 

3. Don't speculate about how your coworkers feel about you. Ask them. Given you are new there, ask your coworkers out for coffee on occasion - and ask them for tips and guidance and their thoughts on how you could be more productive with the team. 

I agree with other commenters that if you are a good engineer - the market is good enough where you won't lack for a job. But if you are going to work with the mindset that people are going to get fired and you don't want to - then you will absolutely give off a competitive vibe and coworkers will pick up on that. Instead you should go to work with a mindset of how I can help the team move forward.  









 Try out customer experience jobs at startups. They are generally open to people without a degree, some support remote work, and will allow you to build a career within an organization and hopefully grow as the space and the company grow. Jobs like these:

http://tapwage.com/channel/hello-customer-meet-startup

One note - any are based in NY or SF so you might need to move and those are expensive cities. But your admin and retail sales skills should work in your favor and hopefully it gives you a start to finding a career.

 



















 Part of your problem might be that your confidence has taken a hit since you graduated especially with that last job and that can often come across in your resume and your interviews.

There are a lot of interesting jobs in media where you can potentially get in on the ground floor and work your way up. A few options (with examples of types of jobs are below)

1. Try a a digital media startup. Your media background will come in handy and as the space explodes, you have a chance to get your foot in the door and grow alongside the company. 

Jobs like these:
http://tapwage.com/channel/diving-into-digital-media

An events coordinator, or social media associate might not be the most glamorous or high paying out of the gate but can get you in the door, and be a platform to build a career.

2. Consider a career related to the media but in sales. Something like ad sales. Hugely coveted and getting more an more important. Something like these:
http://tapwage.com/channel/selling-eyeballs

An account exec job if you feel you have the people skills and sales demeanor or a yield analyst job if you are more quantitative  oriented

3. Maybe a junior marketing job at an entertainment company. Like these:
http://tapwage.com/channel/the-audience-chase

You may need to start as an intern or a planning assistant. But you will likely get paid and again have a chance at building a career in the space.

If you are a good video producer or video editor, there are interesting jobs out there too but those tend to be freelance so unless you have the hustle and really want that career, it can be hard to eke a career out of that. 

Good luck and feel free to pm me with further qs.  




 You could get an engineering degree but that won't necessarily translate to a great aviation job here in the US. You could instead do the following:

1. Work at an aviation related startup - like SpaceX, or Virgin Galactic or GoPro, or a big company doing aviation related projects They all need talented technology professionals and you could be great at those. Check these out:
http://tapwage.com/searchresult?SearchForm%5Bwhat%5D=aviation+aerospace+software SearchForm%5Bwhere%5D=

Even google needs talented technology / software professionals on aviation related projects

2. Go to a big aerospace company like Boeing, Lockheed, etc. They all need great software engineers

3. Also get your private pilots license if you can (it's pricey ~$20-25k in the US) but gettable over a few years and really worth it. Maybe you could even get a job building / testing drones

Engineering is an interesting path but it's a bit commitment and it isn't clear that it will necessarily get you a meaningfully better or more directly aviation related role at these companies.
