 Idk about you, but I go hard or go home. I staying up for 72 hours 




 You do realize that 15gb worth of updates, was added AFTER the disc was released. Likely built up over time, Devs aren't gonna release an updated disc every update. 




 I'm a good person, in fallout 3 I didn't blow up megaton and I disabled the bomb. 




 Sounds like content that SHOULD be in the game rather then as DLC. nb4hate 




 I typing on the ps4.Im on ps4, live North american,on est.Game all day. Got a lvl 21 hunter, and a lvl 1 warlock. Im currently doing strikes and PvP,hope to start doing raids sometime in the future.I do have mic and hope all who add me do too. My psn is test_subject3493 and if im not on destiny i will be soon 
























 Anything like fallout shelter to play till it comes to Android? 




 I mean ps4 has a touch pad, with possibly an unlimited possibility of buttons and functions.... Push to talk doesn't seem like that hard of thing to accomplish for the ps4, dunno about xbone. How about double tap and hold down on dpad . that could work on console 




 HORRY SHEEET , IM IN 




 It let me on earlier weird 




 But the game does work? Eu servers running smooth as butter for a lot of people. 
























 You are dead 




 The items beta test are pose to be getting in the live version of the game for beta testing? 




 Closed beta Client 2, do I need to redownload the entire client when it is launched or will it update? 




 ESO is almost 60gb. Do some research. 




 Let's talk about these armored bear mounts. Will we be able to ride em, or are they npc only? 
























 I laughed more then I should have 




 Just imagine dishonored 2 




 Ahhh good game, good game. You're gonna love the ending 




 I kinda feel like they just took the last update they had at launch, and just fixed stuff list, and sent it out. The patch notes don't seem 15gb worthy , but what do I know? I'm just your run of the mill gamer 




 And commas I believe 
























 Edited, PS4. Sorry my bad lol 




 More like a downgrade then an upgrade 




 Looking for a new guild? Freshly made, Vindictive Vengeance awaits you. We currently reside on the NA servers on ps4 and side with the Aldmeri Dominion. We are a social/pvp guild .currently its just me, but with luck more will come. If youre interested in joining a new guild just out of the guild maker 2000 , then shoot me a message with your psn and you'll get an invite as soon as I get on. 




 Where there is supply there is likely always demand,  unless something better comes along and replaces that supply On a side note is 10k that hard to get? I made about 30-40k from 1-27. And I'm not even at the recommended level for the area where vamps and wolves spawn. Play the game, enjoy the content. Rather then complaining about something so minor. It's a skill tree and a quest. Nothing more, nothing less. I say 10k cause that was the average price on pc, money isn't hard to get, its just time consuming .
EDIT: just realized my first statement doesn't really make a lot of sense, ignore it I suppose 




 ESO Moon Cycles Unlimited 
























 I give 6 it months , and that being generous , before mods pretty much run the content of the game because people have finished everything. 




 So the cash shop respect doesn't have unlimited usage? It's just a one time consumable ? 




 Jane? 




 And now I simply can't wait to get my fill with battleborn. 




 It was Elizabeth, you can tell by the guilty look on her face. 
























 My favorite ps4 game has to be infamous the second son. I had a blast playing the game 




 Are you sure he is isn't the bad pvper? 




 500 more and everyone loses their shit 




 Honest no clue if it will work, but try port forwarding the correct ports . 




 By the time you completely finished everything,all quest, all skyshards, VR14, you should have around 300skill points. 
























 You can change the color though, not only that but you can use sweet tooth's antenna and tires on other vehicles. 




 That man can't be trusted, don't believe everything you read 




 I like the idea of this, I would like to see a decent select of game modes in the future, or custom games with special modifiers, like turning standard in to freeze tag. It would work just like blowing up a car works now,just freezes them instead. 




 My ps4 has yet to get hot .-. 




 Best car is our great lord and Savior, Sweet Tooth 
























 All i can say is the game is still in beta, Everything is subject to change till official launch , and even then they can change stuff I think.The caps are kinda stupid, but make sense.I suppose its holds a balancing factor as well. I cant speak from experience about the pvp, as im not a BIG pvper, but I assume PvP takes skill,especially in a game like skyforge. Only those who truly know their class and know how to play the game can win. Sure some classes have longer range, make it seem impossible to attack them at close range, but Im sure there is a way to beat them, if you're skilled enough. 




 https://youtu.be/KwRSOZJBKg0 play at 54 secs and watch this gif 




 Offline play should track stats 




 It may be random, but when 4 people i know get sweet tooth after getting 1 win with all vehicle ,it seems like that is the a surefire way to get it 




 I do a little dance when I score 
























 Me and my friends just wanted to play a game.We didn't think it would end up like this, I didn't think I would be here in this situation. I don't know how much time I have before..  Let me start at the beginning. It was Friday night, and the weekend was just around the corner and that means free time, lots of free time. My friends and I, normally get together and have a party of sorts. Sometime we throw big ones, other times its just us.This weekend we decided it was just going to be us. Few hours later, We're all sitting of the couch watching TV.
"Lets play a game" Ryan says, my roommate.
 "a game? what kinda game?" ask tom, my best friend.
" oh, nothing much, Its like truth or dare" Ryan says.
"like?" I speak up. 
"yeah man, its simple. We sit in a circle and place one had in the middle of us, and say a few words and then we ask each other truth or dare questions" Ryan says.
 "so its basically truth or dare? isn't that a little weird with just us?" tom asked, chuckling.
 "Nah man, you see cause we wont be talking" Ryan says
 "what do you mean?" i ask.
 "You'll see, lets play. come on" Ryan says.
tom an I look at each other, questioning this in our minds, then look back to Ryan and nod, giving him our approval. 
"alright, give me a few minuets  , ill be right back" Ryan says as he gets up and heads to his room.
 "leave it to Ryan to get us doing something weird" tom says
 "its just a little harmless game, though im confused to what he meant by we wont be talking"I say 
"ha ha, yeah, maybe it'll be gho-" "I'm back, lets get started" Ryan say interrupting tom.
 "OK so what do we do? " I ask.
"well, We sit in a circle. once we do that we place our hands on this peice of paper, and say this phrase "Aperire ostium mortuis messorem" three times"
"Aperire ostium what?" ryan and i asked "I dont know, sound latin, whats on the paper?" i ask
"nothing man, don't worry about it, trust me it'll be fun"
Not wanting to ruin possible fun and Going against my gut feeling I agreed.
 Oh man I should have said no.. I have to go (to be continued) 




 That every community for you, And most the time its lurkers or newcomes that dont know anything about the problems faced when allowing everyone through the gates, let alone the work put to develop the game, and make it online. when an error occurs or when it lags too much, or when maintenance takes too long. Those are the first to complain, from what ive seen. But the game is in beta still, open beta, but beta nevertheless. Bugs happen, and its our jobs as testers* to report the bugs,the glitches, and anything else problematic. It is also our job to suggest things to the developers.

*We become testers once the we start playing the alpha or beta, open or closed. 




 What is prestige? Like what happens when you do prestige? Do I want to Prestige? 




 So going to the tutorial place, after talking to the chick, right when you start, The whole place is bright yellow. Any idea how to fix it?
Im useing the Intel HD 4000, ik it isnt the ideal card for gaming, but its what i got. Any help would be much appreciated , especially from people who have the same card or an intel gpu 




 If anyone has played all the classes, Could you say which one was the most fun to play? I understand its a rather complicated question, since everyone's opinion of "fun" is a little different.
What was the most fun for you? 




 I feel like im trying crack for the first time, and Im being teased 




 Was about to post this update, someone beat me to the punch
 




 Which class looks the purttiest? 




 normally, in just about any mmo, the time frame they give for maintenance is usually off by 30mins-1hr , sometimes 2hrs but not often, they try to keep users in the loop about this. In my experience anyways 




 Thanks for the confirmation , looks like ill be in this for a long run. 




 I heard every class is obtainable, even gunner and berserker through simply playing the game,but it takes some time, is this true?
 




 I have no clue, as the first time ill be playing the game will be in a few mins, but Using logic, and assuming they were logical when developing skyforge, I say Yes you can progress properly. Doesnt make sense to not have it that way. not to me. but again, I know nothing so you shouldnt take my word for it.
