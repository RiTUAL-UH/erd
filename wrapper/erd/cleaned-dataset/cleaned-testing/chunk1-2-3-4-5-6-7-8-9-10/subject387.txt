 I know an older guy who took things personally after losing to a young "showboater" and decided to start a real fight to which the instructors stopped before it could happen and banned him from the school. I was wondering if anyone else has ever seen or been in this type of situation and what the outcome was.

Edit: Why is this getting downvoted? 




 I know Wing Chun was prominently highlighted, but there were also other various styles of Kung Fu as well. Can anyone distinguish the various styles of Kung-Fu demonstrated in the movie?

Japanese Karate was a big aspect of the movie, but does anyone know what particular style of Karate it was?

I thought the movie was very well choreographed and I love how they displayed various styles of martial arts in it :) 




 Like, how likely would it be viable. What're the chances that your wrist is going to be grabbed at some point so that you can put your attacker into a wrist lock?

At my old Taekwondo school, we practiced more than 20 different variations of wrist locks that all involved your opponent grabbing your wrist and you using a type of arm/wrist/shoulder lock to defend yourself.

At my current Taekwondo school, when I asked about my current Master about why we don't practice wrist locks, he said that the only person that's going to grab your wrist is a Cop and that it'd be more beneficial to be spending time on actual fight training rather than "One-Step or Self Defense Techniques." 

Is it bad that my Taekwondo dojang doesn't teach wrist-grab defense or is that skill just not very useful as say knowing how to kick properly? 









 ...while wearing the RF costume? 












































 Say someone started a physical altercation with me and I defended myself by putting him in a submission   told him to stop. Say, the attacker continued to be aggressive so I finished the armbar and broke his arm and he wanted to sue me. Would I be in trouble or would I be able to walk away from any legal trouble on the basis of self-defense? 




 Clearly, in many Karate   Taekwondo schools among all others, we see a large amount of children earning their black belts. If the student has sufficiently demonstrated knowledge and skill that a black belt is required and expected to have, what is the problem with promoting them? A Black Belt doesn't mean that you're able to defend yourself in any situation possible, but it does mean you're able to perform the appropriate techniques and forms that you should've mastered by that level. 

Hell, this [7 year old girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65QCHZDXKmA spfreload=10), who is also a Black Belt, performs forms with precision, spirit, and technique way better than many adults I've seen (even adults with Black Belts). Maybe even better than people on this subreddit.

Just because they are children does not mean that they are incapable of having good technique and the skill that a Black Belt is expected to have.

In my own opinion, I believe "Junior" Black Belts would be more appropriate for children and that they should be required to reach a reasonable age before testing for an Adult Black Belt. But, I still don't understand the ridiculous amounts of criticism against Kids with Black Belts. 

The most ridiculous thing I've heard is how "a school with kids running around with black belts is *most definitely* a McDojo." So you're saying that the girl in the video above was trained at a McDojo? Unlikely.

In my opinion, the amount of young students who have Black Belts at any given school should not give alarm that the school, itself, is a McDojo. Critique them on their technique and skill, not on their age.

Again, that young girl in the video above has demonstrated Kata/Form much better than a lot of grown men I've seen.

Children are clearly capable of having such skill that is expected of a Black Belt.

Thoughts, opinions?

Just as an example, somewhere at 4:04:25, he scores with a punch and scores with another later in the fight as well.

Many other fighters in the video are scoring with punches as well. 




 Kind of a scary thought. Would make things more confusing/slightly more difficult, imo. 




 Mine would be "Ahh-tayy!," Baaah-Chaa!," or "Ushhh!" 




 Papermate pencils have had the worst erasers on them in my experience. Those erasers just smudge everything and do the exact opposite of what they are intended to do.
 









 Felicity: Then how do we know it's Oliver's blood?

Merlyn: ...Because after I leave, you'll test it and after you confirm that it *is* his blood, you'll exhaust yourself with conspiracy theories as to how I planted it or how it's all a lie. And after enough time passes, you'll be left with one inescapable truth - that Oliver Queen is dead.

Thanks to Merlyn we just saved a few episodes where Felicity could've potentially went through a bunch of time trying to confirm that it is Oliver's blood then exhausting herself with conspiracy theories as to how Merlyn planted it or how it's just a lie. And after maybe 2-3 episodes she'd finally start coming to terms with Oliver Queen's death.

Damn, Merlyn must've watched a lot of Asian dramas to point out all these clichs.

John Barrowman is such a great actor.
 




 Also, what do you guys think about the new Canary costume?

Old: http://cdn1-www.superherohype.com/assets/uploads/gallery/arrow-birds-of-prey/71676.jpg

New: http://img2.timeinc.net/ew/i/2014/11/25/Katie-Cassidy_612x380.jpg

Is it possible that the new Canary costume is more conservative because Laurel doesn't have the ample boobage to pull off the more revealing look? 




 Like for example, in Japan, would Karate or Judo be a regular as part of a student's formal physical education in school? 









 For example, does the average Judo Dojo address how to defend against a striker or does it just solely teach sport Judo with throws?

I've tried out a Judo/Jiu-Jitsu school once that claimed to teach "Self-Defense" (as many martial arts schools do nowadays) but only taught throws while completely neglecting how to get in position for a throw in no-gi and how to set-up a throw when an opponent is coming in with kicks and punches. Basically, they just slapped on the "Self-Defense" logo on their Sport Judo training.

I've had the same scenario with Taekwondo. The dojang I go to claims to teach "Self-Defense" but all I learned was how to spar under "Olympic Taekwondo rules" which is does not accurately simulate real fighting scenarios.

Do the training in schools that primarily focus on training for tournaments (like Taekwondo, Judo, maybe even BJJ) naturally translate into real life self-defense even if you aren't given instruction on how to do so?

For example, I don't think someone who solely practices Olympic Taekwondo sparring would be very adept in defending themselves against punches or chokeholds.

Another example would be Kyokushin. Kyokushin Karate is a great martial art, but it does not cover Face Punches at all in it's sparring, so how can Kyokushin practitioners be conditioned/expected to take/defend against punches if all they train in is Kyokushin sparring? Unless they're naturally gifted, talented, or have training in doing so, they can't be expected to do so.


Would someone that only trains under "sport/tournament" rulesets be able to effectively defend themselves in a hostile situation?

EDIT: I'm actually considering taking Kung-Fu San Soo which primarily focuses on "No Rules, Street Self-Defense" on the side to supplement my Martial Arts training as all the training I've ever had has only been practiced under rulesets. On the street, there are no rules. 




 MMA Training is very vigorous, especially to high level athletes, however many manage to go through all that Cardio and manage to still have a significant amount of bodyfat on them. I've always wondered if that had more to do with genetics because obviously, leading up to a fight, a fighter will be on a healthy, clean diet along with an intense training regimen to prepare them for what's to come.

However, I noticed people like BJ Penn or Daniel Cormier (no Fried Chicken jokes please) always seem to carry stubborn bodyfat on them despite the weight cut. Is it just very difficult for some people to reach a low percentage of bodyfat (ripped physique, six pack) than other people? Like are there other factors to it?

It's just hard for me to wrap my mind around how people like Roy Nelson can go through an intense training regime and still manage to be fat.

Excuse the stupid question, it's just something I've always wondered. 
























 Basically preempts where one guy jabs with a knife, you block then grab, go for some sort of lock, trip, or throw and then disarm or where you attempt to hit the knife out there hand, etc.

Obviously in real life, things would not go so smoothly and one cannot predict which direction the knife will come at them nor can they think that fast before they inevitably get struck at in a hostile situation where the attacker is motivated to strike.

However, I believe training and experience is better than no training and experience but I can't possibly imagine someone being able to react fast enough in a real life hostile scenario to defend themselves against a knife attack even with obtained muscle memory.  Hostile situations with a knife are unpredictable and a lot of schools teach pre-set movements, one steps, if you will.

I'd love to hear your guys' opinions on the teachings of pre-set knife defense maneuvers and what purpose/benefit they have, if there is any.

In real life, those one-steps more than likely won't go down as smoothly as how you practice: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsLkqwQrCS8

EDIT: In my opinion, with practicing with a "live" training partner on knife defense would be the best way to go about it when going about it at all.  There's no guaranteed way to protect yourself in a hostile situation and it's usually best to try and escape rather than fight back.  However, if it's a life or death scenario and you know you could possibly die whether you're being compliant with the attacker or not, you want to have a good fighting chance and I think "live" training with knife defense would benefit someone more than pre-set movements. 




 Surely they go half-speed or non full-contact when regarding knees and elbows or another safer way to apply them?  They just seem like very deadly strikes in the Octagon and it's hard to imagine fighters being able to keep going to practice all the time if they're throwing and landing hard knees and elbows during sparring.

 I would first like to point off that I am not a Wing Chun practitioner.

I noticed in a lot of Wing Chun drills, they tend to practice what is known as a "Sticky Hand" drill where they start off with one hand touching the other partner's hand and they keep trapping and blocking until one person manages to get off the chain punches.

Eventually, one gets very good at doing this but is this a practical method of training for someone that might not end up fighting another Wing Chun practitioner? Obviously, in a fight against another style, the fight doesn't start with the hands touching and one might not be able to pull off all the intricate traps and blocks that they practice. 




 The entire story of Avatar: The Last Airbender [All 3 Books] happen within one year.  So much character development in one year, so many things happen, so many things change. 




 I realized that the majority of the shipping done throughout the show were by the male demographic.


Not trying to be intentionally sexist or anything, but I always thought that it was the female demographic that were pro-shipping. 




 Also, whenever she talked, her mouth would move weird or unnatural. 

















































 I've been focusing hard on stretching for quite a long time and I have yet been able to do a high side kick, yet I see young children be able to do seemingly effortlessly without having to work much on their flexibility. It's as if they are naturally more flexible. Is their a reason behind this?

And also, is it possible for an adult to achieve the high level of flexibility that a child can obtain? 

This is my goal: http://www.changstaekwondo.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Changs-Taekwondo-Flexibility.jpg

It just seems extremely difficult to achieve. I can go as high as above the body, and to the face in real-time. But to hold a side kick that high is difficult for me. Any tips? 














 Aang could demolish an entire fleet, Roku demolished an entire palace, Yangchen could move an entire forest with just the Avatar-State Enhanced Airbending, Kyoshi could move fucking Islands.

Korra just shot a long stream of air and lifted a big rock. Was the Avatar State REALLY necessary to do that? It should be able to do **MUCH** much more than just blast a strong burst of air and lift a big rock. Aang could do that at 12 without the Avatar State and he never managed to fully master the elements during the war.

Every scene in which Korra accesses the Avatar State aside from finale Boss Battles has been ridiculously lackluster. Remember Aang in the desert, or against the Earth General who tried to force him into the Avatar State? Korra just doesn't compare. She turns on the Avatar State and gets wiped aside by Dark Spirits or some shit.

Also, in a battle against Combustion Man, Aang straight blasted through a Mountain (and this was after almost getting killed by Azula AND losing access to the Avatar State) whereas Korra gets slammed aside by a rock by Kuvira.

 I kick significantly higher when I'm kicking at real-time/fast. 

But, when I'm doing it slower to focus and practice technique, I can't kick nearly as high.

For EX: I can do a High Sidekick to the face if I'm doing it in real-time, but if I'm just trying to focus on form and doing it slow-I can only go as high as the body.

There has to be a logical explanation to this.

 Okay, so, today is sparring day.  But, I had just finished up some late night classes (I have class from 9-6 PM on Wednesdays) so I was too worn to fight after taking five consecutive exams.  I figured I could just go to practice and watch just to see if I could pick-up something, so I headed off to my Taekwondo dojang right after I left campus.  I ended up showing to class pretty early so I just chilled and waited on the benches after the kids class was over.  The adult class began 30 min. after so I had time to just relax.  

A White Belt, whom I haven't met before, was also on the bench so I decided to make conversation with him.  I asked him if he was planning on competing in the upcoming tournament and he told me he's been having some issues lately and that he isn't where he wants to be (sparring-wise) to enter a tournament.  So, since we had time to kill before class, I decided to try and help the guy out with his sparring by teaching him some combinations he can throw. (EX: Roundhouse Kick set-up followed up with a Back Kick/Spinning Heel Kick) The Master took a seat and watched us for a bit before he started class when a couple other people showed up.

We ended up working for a good 20 minutes before two more guys showed up and class began.  (Tournament is on Friday so a lot of our competitors are taking it easy these last few days before their fights, that's why not many people showed up) Though I was planning on just sitting this practice out, I figured I should join in (didn't bring a uniform so I was just in T-Shirt and Jeans lol) to give the White Belt, we'll call him Jackie, a good practice and so that the two Black Belts could spend time training with each other to prepare for the tournament.

We did some warm-ups, then some basic kicking drills on the hogus, and then finally we started some sparring.  I decided that I would do some light-contact with Jackie just so he could get the opportunity to apply the techniques we discussed and practiced before practice.

So, when it was our turn to spar, I just played defense and baited Jackie to lure out those combinations he practiced earlier.  He ended up landing a lot of the combinations, and I was very impressed.  However, my Master started commenting on my technique and how I wasn't striking back when I had the opportunity to and etc. etc..  (I thought it was obvious why since I was a Blue Belt and he's a White Belt, I wanted to match him at his own level but I wanted to also give him time to get comfortable with using attacks in combination)

I ended up getting lectured a bit on how I was doing and the Master referred to us as "around the same level of skill." I was a bit disappointed because I thought the Master knew I was going easy on the guy, since I was a higher belt and I originally had intention of practicing today like I told him before class started.  It seemed as if he believes that how I was sparring was actually how I sparred Made me feel kind of upset, I guess.

So after class, I told the Master that I was going slower than usual because I wanted to give Jackie the opportunity to practice what we talked about before practice and the Master commented that he was surprised to see Jackie land a couple of those moves.  He thanked me for helping Jackie out and said I could make a good coach someday.

That said, I'm still not entirely certain whether or not he knew/believed that I was quite easier than usual.  Makes me feel eh. /:

What do you guys think? It's been bothering me a bit since the car ride home.

**tl;dr: Went easy on a beginner and got critiqued for it.  I feel like my Master thinks that I was actually giving it my all because he criticized how I wasn't hitting at every open opportunity I had. (When I was really going easy on purpose so the beginner could have a chance at scoring on me)  So, basically, I think he thinks I suck despite me having trained for quite awhile compared to the beginner.**

**Update: Thank you very much everyone for your comments.** 














 I know some schools tend to "lie" about their competitors' age and belt level so that they would have an edge over competition.  But that got me thinking, since in a lot of schools grading/testing is up to the student what if someone decided to remain a white belt/lower belt for a very long time?  That would give them a ridiculous edge amongst lower belts that have just gotten their rank/haven't been training as long after they've received their belt in competition.

Is there any way to judge where someone should be at in competition? My Master offered to change my birthdate and suggest that I compete at a lower belt level than where I'm at so that I could have a better chance at winning my next competition.  The whole thing seems very shady.

I recall my Master telling me about a tournament in which a White Belt was using Spinning Heel Kicks, Back Kicks, and other various advanced kicks at a high degree of flexibility.  Either that was a Martial Arts prodigy, or they weren't actually a white belt.  (My Master believes the latter.)

Any thoughts and opinions on this topic? 














 Hey /r/martialartists. I have a big question regarding weight training and cutting for tournaments. Right now I'm a pretty skinny individual and I've been trying to bulk up and gain some muscle. I've bulked up ~15 lbs since I first started weight training and a trainer recommended I at least get up to 165 lbs (I'm 142-5 lbs rn) before I even think about cutting just because I don't have enough muscle mass on me yet to make an efficient cut.

However, for an upcoming tournament I would have to cut down to 125-135 lbs if I want to have an even fight.

The time frame from here till the upcoming tournament (Jan) isn't enough for me to bulk efficiently to put on more muscle, which is my goal.

Doing martial arts already makes it difficult enough to put on weight but it's recommended that I don't try to put on weight because I'll be slower and outclassed in sparring.

I've been told by /r/fitness that if I cut right now, since I don't have much muscle mass, I'll look like an anorexic twig. I'll likely be much weaker as well.

I'm conflicted over if I should continue to bulk and if I should cut for tournaments.

Pros of Bulking and weight training is that I'll be able to put on more muscle and gain strength.

Downside is that I'll likely be somewhat slower and if I do manage to get to 165 and decide to spar at that weight division, at my 5'8'' height, I'll likely be sparring with guys 6'' and over. 

Pros of Cutting is that I'll be lighter and more agile and quicker. I'll also likely get an even match-up at a tournament as well. Someone closer to my height and reach.

Downside is that I'll be terribly skinny and weak if I drop to 125 with the amount of muscle I currently have right now. 

I definitely don't think I'll look like Bruce Lee or even come close to the strength he had if I drop from 145 to 125. (Since Bruce was 5'7.5''   125 lbs by the end of Enter the Dragon) He had a ripped physique, one I hope to obtain but I was told that just cutting won't give me that physique. That I have to bulk and gain muscle first before cutting fat.

I'm so conflicted. Anyone think they can offer me some advice? 




 When we do kicking drills with the shields/pads or with just wearing a chest protector, I still get knocked the air out of me sometimes when someone lands a good back kick and it still hurts when someone is just pounding on my ribs with those alternating roundhouses while I just stand there with my chest gear on. Is this something you get used to over time?

At the school I originally started out at, the students didn't kick very hard at all. But after trying out a few other Taekwondo and Muay Thai schools, I notice the majority of students training with intensity. Of course we don't intentionally try to kill each other, or at least I don't, but it really sucks when you're just standing there holding a shield/pad or with your arms out to the side, fully vulnerable with chest gear exposed and having to just tank those kicks. Damn, they can hurt. 

I noticed trying to breathe out when getting kicked seems to help when I'm wearing the chest gear and acting as a human dummy or applying a bit of counter-force at the same time my opponent kicks the shield/pad I'm holding.

Any advice on how to minimize the pain? Or am I just being kind of a bitch. 




 I know Tenzin sent his three children on a mission to find her, but I really thought they were going to have a full-scale investigation ASAP.

 We've heard Meelo and Ikki talk but Jinora has been very quiet.

EDIT: I think I might be mistaken and we've only seen her in 2/3 of the episodes so far. But still. 














 I've been training at my Taekwondo Dojang for a year and recently switched to a different one. At this new Dojang we practice using a full range of motion and carrying through all the way when we do Head Kicks. At my old Dojang we were taught to have control and not make contact with Head Kicks, so I have this extremely bad habit of stopping RIGHT BEFORE I make contact. I can't get over it. It shows up during kicking drills and it shows up during sparring. 

Please give me advice.

EDIT: This only applies to Head Kicks, btw. I throw body kicks just fine. 




 I read somewhere that they're trying to add punches back into Taekwondo. I think the way Olympic Sparring is ruled is a little ridiculous. It discourages punches by making them nearly impossible to score with so you'll always see Olympic TKD Practitioners sparring with their hands down. Try catching a punch in Olympic Taekwondo matches.

The whole thing is like foot fencing. 









 As much as I'd love to see him fight his way to the top again, I believe his age will be against him. 









 I can't find one. Clicking on Stan, Kyle, Kenny, or Cartman takes me to YouTube and clicking on the South Park sign takes me to the Reddit Front Page. 









 At my Taekwondo Dojang, you have the option to test every two months. $69 a week before the testing date and you're pretty much guaranteed to go up a belt. No one ever fails. 

I think it's a little ridiculous how easy it is to go up Belts. I've already paid $300+ and there's still 10 more Belts to go before I reach Black Belt. Sometimes I don't feel like I'm learning anything new besides forms when going up belts though. I don't think I'm getting adequate training and I want to say the same for my fellow students as well.

As an Orange Belt sparring with Brown and Black Belts, my teacher has asked me to go easier on them which I find ridiculous. The level of skill that the majority higher level belts have is very lacking. I shouldn't have to go easier on higher belts just because I train harder than them in my free time.

I was thinking about this earlier and I realized how pointless these Belts are now. I don't think I can afford to keep paying for my Belt testing and that is why I will never achieve my dream of becoming a Black Belt.

Besides, money is scarce right now and college books are more important to me.

**tl;dr: Belts at my Dojang aren't so much a measure of skill as they are a measure of how much disposable income you have.**

 Trying to do MMA for the first time. Can you guys give me your opinion on the pricing for the MMA gym by my place?

$250 first month for membership fee + sparring gear. Access to unlimited Muay Thai Classes, Xtreme Kickboxing, Heavy Bag room, and Weight Room, and No Gi Jiujitsu. $125 a month after the first month. 

It's a 1 year contract.


Total comes to $1,625 a year. 



















 I've been doing Olympic-Style WTF Taekwondo for a year now.

My Taekwondo school has been getting really stale lately. The only people in my adult class are two 12 and 13 y/o boys, three 15-16 y/o girls, a ~40ish y/o man, occasional 30 y/o women, and a 17 y/o me. I can't fucking spar full force against anyone without being afraid I'll break them (literally). We've had to **cancel all our sparring classes** because the low number of students in the Adult class who actually show up on Sparring days. So right now all we do is Forms, Kicking Drills, BS Self-Defense lessons (Oh, if you punch me I'll step to the side and strike your organs! Wait no! You're supposed to not react when I chop you in the ribcage!!! ), and other random things that would get me *mugged* irl. 

I practice by myself these past few months after all the teenage boys/ young men around my age left. I usually don't show up to class as much anymore, and when I do we hardly even do kicking drills anymore. 
I feel like I get a lot more practice just doing kicking drills with the dummy on my own and going to class and comparing myself with the Black Belts confirms it. 

The Black Belts in my class aren't real Black Belts, imo. They don't remember their One-Step forms, Poomsaes, and they're very sub-par when it comes to Sparring. I usually make short-work with them and I'm only a Purple-Striped Belt. It got to the point where, when we did do sparring, that my Master would ask me to go easier on them. I'm 100% sure they would get mugged irl too.

I recently went to an **MMA Gym** and tried out the Muay Thai class there and man was I impressed. People do not waste time there. We spend ~10-15 minutes or so warming up by Jumping Rope (Which is one hell of a leg burn) and alternating between Push-Ups and Sit-Ups. Afterwards we grab a partner and practice various sets of combinations/techniques with the pads and then we get to have a "free round" where we can practice anything we want. We get some time to spar at the end of each class as well. Let me tell, you. It was intense. No one was going easy. In fact, after getting into the habit of always holding back with my strikes, the students there and the teacher there encouraged me to hit harder because I was hitting too softly (compared to everyone else who uses their roundhouse kicks like they're swinging a freaking bat.) At the end of the day I was really sweaty and ridiculously sore all over, a feeling I would never get in Taekwondo class. I learned so much in that one day class trial too and got the chance to come to another day for free. A lot of Taekwondo techniques do transition over to Muay Thai pretty well and the coaches there offered to help me build off of what I already know since they also have had experience in Taekwondo. Oh, they also have a huge gym too. There's a weight room, heavy bag room, octagon/cage, everything. Also everyone in here looks like they're in **very good shape**. It's mostly young men, a couple older guys (that're still in very good shape as well), and a few girls that can probably take on all the Black Belts at my school single-handedly.

A lot of the habits we develop in Taekwondo - like not keeping our hands up is a very *very* **very** bad habit in Muay Thai since in Olympic Taekwondo, they restrict face punches. Now since Boxing is a big aspect in Muay Thai, if you keep your hands low, you're gonna get knocked out.

I also realized how terrible my hands were. I can't recall a single day we practiced punches in Taekwondo, despite the fact that the Master keeps claiming it's 70% Kicking and 30% Punching. Unless, you include the Punching we do as part of our forms as Punching, than yeah I guess. Looking back, Olympic Taekwondo sparring is no way analogous with Practical/Realistic Fighting whereas Muay Thai is **very** practical.

Unfortunately, if I stop doing Taekwondo (my year contract is over by the end of this month btw) before I reach my Black Belt, my father would be very disappointed. My father has encouraged me so much to earn my Black Belt (because apparently it looks good on college applications or something) and it's heavily implied that I would make him very proud if I managed to earn it. But, I don't want to spend his money on learning all the nonsense I've had to put up with this entire year. It's not worth it, imo.

Oh yeah, by the way, you can pretty much go up a belt every two months if you can afford to pay the $70 Belt "testing" fee. There's fucking 15 Belts though and I'm not even halfway there yet. I've gone up 5 Belts in a year though.

Disclaimer: NO disrespect to my Master or the Art of Taekwondo, itself. This is just my own opinion with my particular school and experience. 

tl;dr: I'm not learning anything new in TKD. Went to a Muay Thai class, learned a lot and broke one hell of sweat doing so. Should I switch and make myself happy (and a better martial artist) or should I try to go for my Black Belt and make my father happy? 

EDIT: Hopefully I get at least a few answers. I can already tell I pissed some people off by the *huge amount of downvotes*. Even though I have no idea why. Sorry if I posted this on the wrong subreddit. 


**EDIT#2**: Stunning realization at 3 AM
I've wasted time and money learning fucking nonsense that the school has taught me.

Who the fuck fights with their guard down?


I DO.


Who the fuck has to spend half the class doing ridiculous Yoga stretches?


I DO.


Who paid $70 five times for my own master to evaluate me to go up a belt that means fucking nothing since I've had to go easier on Brown Belts when I was an Orange Belt?


MY FATHER DID.


AND WHO HAS BEEN PRACTICING "Self-Defense" TECHNIQUES AS IF THE PERSON I'M USING ON WON'T REACT TO IT AT ALL AND ALLOW ME TO PERFORM 5 CONSECUTIVE STRIKES WHILE THEY STAND COMPLETELY STILL!?


-I FUCKING DO.


Who the fuck spars with little boys and young girls and expects to improve?


I fucking do


Who the fuck has been practicing a style that involves no face punches?


I do.


Disclaimer: Granted all the things above, I was forced to do by my Master since he was teaching the goddamn class. I used to look up to him like a fucking God. Now I realize what a joke everything is.



WTF Taekwondo is a bunch of bullshit and if I hadn't been practicing on my own, I would've had absolutely nothing to carry over to Muay Thai. At least I've gotten good at the Spinning Back Kick and the Spinning Heel Kick (which seem to have made it's way over to MMA very well) and obtained a good level of flexibility.


**tl;dr: I've realized I've gotten really good at something that's dumb.**



EDIT#3: Public Service Anouncement - If you do Taekwondo, realize that you're doing it for sport and that it is NO WAY analogous or similar to Real Fighting at all. You can and likely will get knocked out irl if you try to fight with your hands down and do tippy tap snappy kicks that have no power behind them.

Trust me, I've been training pretty hard at this. And it fucking sucks.


EDIT#4: Too many fucking edits. This post turned out to be way longer than I intended it to be. Sorry. 


EDIT#5: 

Who the fuck spends time breaking wooden boards to "showcase their power?"


I do.. 




 I've been doing Olympic-Style WTF Taekwondo for a year now.

My Taekwondo school has been getting really stale lately. The only people in my adult class are two 12 and 13 y/o boys, three 15-16 y/o girls, a ~40ish y/o man, occasional 30 y/o women, and a 17 y/o me. I can't fucking spar full force against anyone without being afraid I'll break them (literally). We've had to cancelled all our sparring classes because the low number of students in the Adult class who actually show up on Sparring days. So right now all we do is Forms, Kicking Drills, BS Self-Defense lessons (Oh, if you punch me I'll step to the side and strike your organs! Wait no! You're supposed to not react when I chop you in the ribcage!!! ), and other random things that would get me *mugged or beat up* irl. 

I practice by myself these past few months after all the teenage boys/ young men around my age left. I usually don't show up to class as much anymore, and when I do we hardly even do kicking drills anymore. 
I feel like I get a lot more practice just doing kicking drills with the dummy on my own and going to class and comparing myself with the Black Belts confirms it. 

The Black Belts in my class aren't real Black Belts, imo. They don't remember their One-Step forms, Poomsaes, and they're very sub-par when it comes to Sparring. I usually make short-work with them and I'm only a Purple-Striped Belt. It got to the point where, when we did do sparring, that my Master would ask me to go easier on them.

I recently went to an MMA Gym and tried out the Muay Thai class there and man was I impressed. People do not waste time there. We spend ~10 minutes or so warming up by Jumping Rope (Which is one hell of a leg burn) and alternating between Push-Ups and Sit-Ups. Afterwards we grab a partner and practice various sets of combinations/techniques with the pads and then we get to have a "free round" where we can practice anything we want. We get some time to spar at the end of each class as well. Let me tell, you. It was intense. No one was going easy. In fact, after getting into the habit of always holding back with my strikes, the students there and the teacher there encouraged me to hit harder because I was hitting too softly (compared to everyone else who uses their roundhouse kicks like they're swinging a freaking bat.) At the end of the day I was really sweaty and ridiculously sore all over, a feeling I would never get in Taekwondo class. I learned so much in that one day class trial too and got the chance to come to another day for free. A lot of Taekwondo techniques do transition over to Muay Thai pretty well and the coaches there offered to help me build off of what I already know since they also have had experience in Taekwondo.

A lot of the habits we develop in Taekwondo - like not keeping our hands up is a very *very* **very** bad habit in Muay Thai since in Olympic Taekwondo, they restrict face punches. Now since Boxing is a big aspect in Muay Thai, if you keep your hands low, you're gonna get knocked out.

I also realized how terrible my hands were. I can't recall a single day we practiced punches in Taekwondo, despite the fact that the Master keeps claiming it's 70% Kicking and 30% Punching. Unless, you include the Punching we do as part of our forms as Punching, than yeah I guess. Looking back, Olympic Taekwondo sparring is no way analogous with Practical/Realistic Fighting whereas Muay Thai is **very** practical.

Unfortunately, if I stop doing Taekwondo (my year contract is over by the end of this month btw) before I reach my Black Belt, my father would be very disappointed. My father has encouraged me so much to earn my Black Belt (because apparently it looks good on college applications or something) and it's heavily implied that I would make him very proud if I managed to earn it. But, I don't want to spend his money on learning all the nonsense I've had to put up with this entire year. It's not worth it, imo.

tl;dr: I'm not learning anything new in TKD. Went to a Muay Thai class, learned a lot and broke one hell of sweat doing so. Should I switch and make myself happy (and a better martial artist) or should I try to go for my Black Belt and make my father happy?


Disclaimer: NO disrespect to my Master or the Art of Taekwondo, itself. This is just my own opinion with my particular school and experience. 









 On YouTube, I see a lot Olympic Taekwondo Knockouts resulting from Spinning Hook Kicks to the Face or the Chin. I've seen videos where people get knocked out from getting straight kicked to the face with a jumping back kick as well. I was told in my Dojang that you are only allowed to do Head Kicks to the Helmet. Would such a Knockout lead to disqualification in a Tournament? 









 It seems silly that punches to the head are forbidden yet kicks to the head are allowed, yet kicks to the head can be much more devastating than a punch to the head.

I asked an ex-Karateka this question and he gave me quite a silly answer as to why his dojo enforced this rule, "Because head punches kill." He was totally serious, btw. 




 First of all, I should mention that I'm not a mixed martial artist. 

Watching UFC, I noticed a lot of fighters throwing leg kicks at each other in a fight, but I never notice the effect/impact that it has on the person taking the hit. I believe the purpose of the leg kick is to, obviously, injure the other person's base and slow them down but most fighters seem to be able to tank the hits just fine. 


It seems to me like leg kicks are usually just checks. Is that true? Can someone explain this to me? I'd really like to know. 




 They always release an update and it gets bombarded with complaints about glitches and crap.  




 I started taking Taekwondo in October of last year. I thought I would be learning an intense martial art and get a great workout out of it. I want to get into MMA, eventually because I really like the versatility of it. I thought Taekwondo would give me a great striking base and an advantage over other striking styles because of the unorthodox kicks like the Wheel Kick/Spinning Hook Kick and the Back Kick. Anthony Pettis, Anderson Silva, Cung Le, Edson Barboza, and various other MMA fighters with TKD backgrounds have inspired me to take up this great kicking art.


I was fucking wrong.


90% of the people in my class are either teenage girls or moms. The other 9% are young boys who somehow made the adult class and out of shape middle-aged men. I'm 17.


I find myself having to go easy on everyone. Even though I'm only a Purple-Stripe belt (6 belts from White Belt), I spar better than everyone in my class including the Black Belts, which are all teenage girls btw, other than the Master and his son.


Apparently, no one in my class likes Sparring other than me. We used to spar twice a week, (Tuesdays and Fridays) but then it got cut down to one because no one showed up to Sparring on Fridays.


Tuesday Sparring is bullshit. We don't even spar the entire time, we practice on one-steps/basic kicking drills first and then, IF I'M LUCKY, we get to do free sparring for 10 minutes or so. Most of the time, there's more girls than guys in the class. When that happens, the Master sits all the guys down and has us watch the girls. So, basically, if there's not enough guys in the class, I don't get to spar.


I've always wanted to get a Black Belt in Martial Arts because I thought it showed commitment. But, belt testing is $69 per testing and I don't feel like I'm truly learning anything new each time I move up a belt.
Pretty much, the only reason why I'm at the level I'm at is because I watch a lot of tutorials by Kwonkicker   GingerNinjaTrickster on YouTube along with TKD Competition videos which teaches me techniques I haven't learned in class and good combos to go along with them.


Most of the time, in sparring, the other people in my class just stick with basic roundhouse kicks and predictable/ill-timed back kicks. On the other hand, I use my entire arsenal. Roundhouse Kick feint into Spinning Hook Kick, Side Kick transition to jump Back Kick, etc. etc.


I wish there were more people around my age that could spar with me. My Master's son is a very good fighter and has proven it time and time again in National competitions. His footwork, timing, speed, feints, and dexterity with his kicks is insane. I want to get that good, but I know I'll never get that good with the kind of competition I'm sparring with, when I get to spar that is


I feel like I've been wasting my time and money here. Though, I really want to just detach myself from this dojang and go learn some real fighting, I'd feel like it'd be a waste for me to drop my training when I haven't even gotten my First Degree Black Belt. On the flipside, I feel it's a meaningless title if I keep training with the people here.


tl;dr: Competition at this school is stale. Is it worth to keep going to get my Black Belt before training in Muay Thai, or should I just drop now?

 What sets it apart from Karate, Taekwondo, Sanshou, Kickboxing, etc. etc.


Is it just more well-balanced and better suited for the MMA ruleset than the other striking styles?

Karate, Kickboxing, TKD, etc. etc. have limitations in their sparring rules. But, Muay Thai sparring seems to be the most "free" of all of them which is good for transitioning into MMA. Is that what it is?

Oh, and is it possible to be a good Striker without adding Muay Thai to your skillset? Having come from doing a lot of traditional Martial Arts as a child, it seems to me that all the striking arts have the same basics. When you get into the more advance techniques, what works and doesn't work for MMA should depend on what you believe is right for the current situation. For EX, Spinning Hook Kicks are encouraged in TKD sparring as it yields the most points. (Also, it's done very often because there's no punches to the head allowed) However, in MMA or Muay Thai, wheel kicks can also be dangerous because you're turning your back. So basically, what's encouraged and good for certain TMAs sparring rules, can be risky for MMA.


For MMA, you need to be able to adapt to the Striking rules there. There's no "no head punches" rule, no points, or etc. etc. so you gotta be able to adapt. It's more of a mindset than anything and Muay Thai seems to be better suited for that from the get-go. Is that right?

Is it easy to transition from Gi to No Gi on your own?

 Started my freshman year of college last month. Never had a girlfriend throughout High School. Got rejected three times in a row with three different girls and that just hurt my confidence and self-esteem for awhile. But that's in the past.


Cute girl in my English class. Been wanting to talk to her for awhile just too shy to. She walks my direction on Monday after I'm walking to the parking lot because class was cancelled, I let her know and she thanked me.


Today, I was waiting in my car for class to start and she happened to park right next to me. Tried to say Hi but she didn't notice. Left my car and went to class about 3 minutes before she left her car.


Both of us were waiting infront of class for the teacher to come. I start talking to her. I make up jokes about how I hope class'll be cancelled again. Also, jokingly tells her I noticed she parked right next to me and I tried to say Hi but she totally ignored me. She laughs and such. Asked her about her Major, what she wants to do etc. etc.
In class, sits next to her, introduces myself and she introduces herself. Goes in for a handshake in which she jokingly replies that I should have a firmer handshake.


Jokingly asks her if I could copy off her for the quiz with a wink. She says yes and laughs. Some basic flirting here and there etc. etc. etc.


Turns out with both have the same major but she switched to Poli-Sci and we have the same classes with the same teachers (just at different times besides this English Class) If anything, that's at least one thing that we both have in common that I can talk about :)

Was planning on getting her number at the end of class but totally chickened out. (I had my phone stolen yesterday but just got a spare phone from a friend) Instead I told her I'd see her next week while walking out of class and she just smiled and waved at me.


Next class is on Monday :/ Really wanted to keep talking to her. She's outrageously pretty, smart, and funny :)


I think I made a pretty good first impression, she was pretty engaged when I was talking and making jokes. :)
I was trying to be myself and was acting confident doing so.


Anyways, advice on getting her number on Monday and maybe getting closer with her? I have terrible experiences with girls and I'm determined to change it my luck this time around :D


Thank you, Reddit. First time on this sub.


P.S. Sorry for grammar.


Edit: Also she looks extremely out of my league. 



















 In my Taekwondo Dojang, we learn applications of self-defense from Hapkido as well as part of our standard Taekwondo curriculum. Most of our self-defense techniques involve learning how to release yourself from a wrist-grab and following up with a joint lock whether it be an armbar or a wristlock. 
So far, I have learned 10 different ways (2 techniques learned per belt) of releasing yourself from a wrist-grab and I've found it unnecessarily excessive that we have to practice so many different techniques to release ourselves from a wrist-grab. In most hostile situations, I doubt knowing how to release yourself from a wrist-grab would come in handy. I wish we would learn more practical self-defense like how to block punches or something instead of learning a million ways of defending yourself from a wrist-grab. 
Can someone explain to me why wrist-grab self-defense is so emphasized? I'm pretty sure there's a good reason, I just can't come up with one on my own and, to be frank, I doubt I will ever need to apply this technique in a real life scenario.




The problem when learning these "One-Step" Self-Defense techniques is we practice doing them as if the opponent wouldn't react. I doubt in a real life situation if someone ever grabbed your wrist, they wouldn't just stand their and allow you to release yourself. The moment you'd try to react to the wrist-grab, they'd probably punch you in the face.

 I've seen so many ridiculous explanations to why Taekwondo practitioners keep their hands down to the side and do not punch. Some even argue that Taekwondo practitioners do not punch because "punches do not score as much as a kick" which is ridiculous because anyone who does WTF Taekwondo Sparring knows that a Punch or Kick to the body is worth one point. 

I've watched several videos of big WTF Taekwondo competitions ranging from World Tournaments to the Olympics and the style of fighting is very much the same. Many practitioners keep their hands to the side and do not throw punches even when in punching-distance (they go in for the clinch). 
While there's probably a valid strategical reason for this, it just doesn't make sense to me why 99% of people do not throw punches in this sport even though it is perfectly legal and, according to the rules, scores a point.
People will argue that kicking is the shortest distance between you and your opponent, but isn't the shortest distance really a straight punch from the leading hand? Punching is quicker than Kicking if you are in proper range.

Because of the way I've seen other practitioners spar, it has affected the way I spar. I feel extremely awkward whenever I am in punching-range with someone and try to exchange punches with them because we never practice throwing punches, at all. (Except maybe for Counter Punches here and there where you block with one hand and go in for a punch with the other hand) I'd get into range with someone, exchange some punches then taking some punches (because I was never taught how to Block Punches) then slide back to kicking distance. I feel almost like punching is discouraged.

A friend once asked me if you could win a Taekwondo fight with purely punches and I did not know how to answer his question. Theoretically, according to the rules, you should be able to. But, that fact of the matter is, I have never seen someone throw a punch (if they even throw a punch) in WTF Sparring and scored a point from it. I believe that since the the rules make it so difficult to score a point with punches, it is actually discouraging punching in a way.

tl;dr: Why do WTF Taekwondo Practitioners spar with their hands by their sides (Guard Down) and do not throw Punches? This seems like a very impractical way to fight and, in my own personal opinion, creates bad habits for when a Taekwondo practitioner fights under a different rule set or in a hostile street fight situation.

 I consider myself a huge follower of Bruce Lee's philosophy. 
(The Following is a sample of Bruce's Philosophy in my own words and interpretation) Bruce believed that a martial artist shouldn't be limited to any one style of fighting. According to him, a martial artist should be able to adapt to any situations. To him, "styles" are attempts to "arrest the flow of conflict" and in actual combat, the opponent doesn't wait for formalities. The opponent isn't a robot, but a human being-fluid and alive. To him, "traditional arts were a blind devotion to the systematic uselessness of routines that lead nowhere." That's why he went against tradition and created his own martial art/philosophy of "Jeet Kune Do" a style without styles so that it may assume every style. (Sorry if that's a bit confusing).
My father is a traditional man and is against my intentions of studying other martial arts outside of Taekwondo. In my opinion, a good martial artist should be proficient in multiple fields rather than just one. For example, Taekwondo is a good striking art that uses kicks as the weapon of choice and is well known for their variety of deadly kicks. However, everything has their strengths and weaknesses. Taekwondo fighters are generally not very good at using their hands offensively and since kicks can only be thrown at a long distance, they would be at a huge disadvantage at close-range fighting against a trained Boxer. Also, when it comes to ground fighting and grappling, Taekwondo fighters aren't usually taught how to handle those types of situations. So, if I were ever taken to the ground by a Jujitsu practitioner, I would have no idea how to handle myself properly in that situation. With all that said, my point is that every martial art has their strengths and weaknesses. If you only know one martial art, you're stuck with that one style's weakness. However, mastering other arts may compensate for each others' weaknesses. This is what I believe and what I find logical. However, my father believes that mastering one art is enough to handle any kind of situation. I strongly disagree. I just came here today to ask for everyone's opinions on me   my father's beliefs. I want to hear the Pros and Cons of Cross-Training in Martial Arts. 
Thank you for your time.

 As a Taekwondo practitioner, winning a US Open Champion title isn't that huge of an accomplishment.

 Thank you.

 That said though, I've found that WTF footwork gave me great ability to get in and other, but poor lateral movement. 

- It's a common beginner tactic to slide back and forward rather than use angles.  For the more experienced fighters at my Dojang, we emphasize angles.  Most Taekwondo kicks travel down a linear line in order to reach their target so angling out at the same time as someone is about to chamber off-sets their attack and gives you time to counter-attack while they have to re-orient or reposition themselves.  Angles are quite common in higher belts but just back and forth motion is very common amongst lower belts.  We definitely practice lateral movement with ladder drills.  Ladder Drills are a staple of Taekwondo footwork training.


 I've heard that this is less of a problem now because of electronic scoring being able to register the impact of a lead leg side kick and thus score it properly. Is that right?
 

- The Side Kick is one of the most powerful kicks in all of Taekwondo, in my opinion.  However, it's hard to score on someone's Hogu or eHogu (The Chest Guard) with a Side-Kick because of the side-on stance that Taekwondo Fighters adopt.  That said, we use front-leg side kicks very often at my Dojang as a "cut kick" or an attack that intercepts someone's forward movement and keeps them at range.  The Side Kick is the longest weapon in a TKD Fighter's arsenal.  Also, practicing proper technique for the Side Kick translates into the thrusting motion at the end of a Spinning Back Kick which is very often used to counter an opponent's Roundhouse Kick.  So to answer your question - it depends on the fighter and how they train.  I've sparred with opponents that consistently rely on their straight-line side kick and I've sparred with opponents that seldom use it or never use it at all.  Haven't seen a decreasing trend in it's usage though.  But, it's important to note that I've noticed a lot of fighters don't score on the Hogu with it.  Like I said, they use it to cram or push an opponent's ongoing attack or they'll score with a high side kick to the head.

EDIT: Hopefully I answered your question somewhat. 




 "Spinning Shit" is the epitome of Taekwondo and their destructive power is what defines the style, in my opinion. 




 "You are good enough to have submitted a BJJ black belt with guillotine and americana (Lyoto Machida, Vitor Belfort)  and everything, but that does not make you a black belt."

This is true. 




 Contra? 




 Hi, friend. Thanks for calling me over here.

I would like to share some thoughts of mine regarding the Taekwondo fighter, as I, myself, also come from an Olympic Sparring background and how he could've addressed some of these issues to sufficiently prepare himself in the Kickboxing match.

**1.  Boxing**

I'm just gonna point out the obvious here and say that Yong Soo Park did not work on his boxing enough or, seemingly, at all.  He would always keep his hands down in his fighting stance which is a huge no-no in kickboxing.  Also, his lack of experience with punches attributed to his weakness by lack of experience against punches.  As you've all noticed having watched the video - he had no response to any barrage of punches.  Every time he was overwhelmed, he would clinch up (WTF TKD style clinch) to avoid getting hit until the referee broke it up.  This is a habit learned in WTF Taekwondo.  In WTF Taekwondo, whenever someone is being flurried by kicks - they usually jam and clinch until the ref breaks it up, go for a high kick from close-clinch range (Think Crescent Kick - which can be done at very close range to the head), or move back while striking simultaneously. (Think Jumping Back Kick for the last one)  Because of his lack of boxing training, Park went in fighting Taekwondo-style instead of adapting and evolving his arsenal of attacks to fit in and survive in a Kickboxing or Muay Thai environment.

**2.  Checking the Leg Kicks**

As Lawrence Kenshin has pointed out, the classic side-on stance of Taekwondo makes the fighter a smaller target and allows them to move in and out quickly to find proper range for their kicks.  This could've worked to Park's advantage... had there been no leg kicks involved.  Again, like Kenshin said, the side-on stance makes it very difficult - almost impossible, imo, to properly check leg kicks and, therefore, Park was left taking the majority of all the leg kicks Kaoklai threw.  You could see how this affected him in later rounds - the guy looked like he was about to just give up.  Especially for a style of fighting that heavily relies on kicking to attack - leg kicks crippled him.

**3.  Lack of Diverse Kicking**

In my opinion, Park did not demonstrate his [full Taekwondo arsenal](http://www.reddit.com/r/martialarts/comments/31joyw/taekwondo_v_kickboxing_good_example_of_how/) during the bout.  He stuck to Mid   High-Leveled Roundhouse Kicks to, respectively, the body or the head.  Few times he threw Axe Kicks or tried to make use of a Spinning Back Kick but every time he did, from what I saw, he either missed completely or barely grazed his opponent.  You would think a Taekwondo fighter would fight to his advantage against a Thai Boxer by trying to overwhelm them with unpredictable kicks at every opportunity they can find.

**4.  Lack of Strategical Footwork**

In my experience with Olympic-Sparring Taekwondo we put a lot of time on footwork.  In-and-Out movements along with checking and feints to help us control the distance and bait out our opponent in order to trap them with whatever we choose - usually a counter-kick such as a Spinning Hook Kick which can be devastating if landed properly.  From what I've seen with Park, he didn't use any good footwork in his match with Kaoklai.  He either just stepped in to attack or stood there for Kaoklai to attack him.  This is a big reason why he couldn't use his full arsenal of Taekwondo kicks as stated in reason #3 above.  Without proper footwork to lead into various kicks, he limited himself to just throwing Roundhouse Kicks off the line - which in my opinion, did nothing to Kaoklai.  

**5. NOT using his long reach to his advantage**

Kicks give more reach than punches do and in Olympic Sparring - taller fighters tend to ward off their opponents by using their reach to their advantage by keeping them at bay with long range kicks such as front leg Side Kicks whenever their opponent tries to step in to attack.  Park did no such thing against his much smaller opponent.  At [SIX FOOT SIX or 6'6''](http://k-1sport.de/en/database/show_fighter.php?id=1112), Park was by far one of the tallest Taekwondo fighters at the time and he could of easily used the strategy I mentioned in the last sentence to his advantage - yet he didn't.



**Additional Thoughts**


It's amusing see that a National Taekwondo Champion stripped himself of the best aspects of Taekwondo sparring when integrating into Kickboxing.  In my opinion, Kaoklai made him look like a White Belt - straight up.  Coming in with mid and high Roundhouse Kicks as his only attacks with predictable footwork only made himself an easy opponent for Kaoklai.

Wrote this on a short notice but these are the obvious issues that should be addressed.  May this video be of reference to any Taekwondo fighter looking into Kickboxing.  In my opinion, to be successful in Kickboxing or Muay Thai - you cannot be a Taekwondo Fighter that trains Muay Thai; you have to be a Thai Boxer that also, in addition to their Thai training, has had solid Taekwondo training as a plus.

Like /u/Carlos13th stated above regarding TKD techniques:


All the technqiues were valid technqiues and could work under the right circumstances but you need basic striking fundamentals to set them up and use them effectively in a full contact fight. They cannot be your entire game.

EDIT: Fixed formatting.

 Forgot to mention Felicity had feelings for Barry at one point as well. 




 Yeah, I figured as much. :( 




 With the Arrow and Firestorm showing up and all that.  The trailer under the title "All Star Team-Up" showed all that.  I was really looking forward to seeing a battle against the Reverse Flash this episode - I even skipped out on a couple other things tonight just so I wouldn't miss it because I couldn't wait.  Not complaining, tonight's episode was cool but definitely not what I was hyped up for.

 I've been training with the BoB (Body Opponent Bag) in my backyard without any mats for awhile now and I've been injured a couple times falling or rolling on my ankles on the hard concrete.  I think it'd be safer if I started putting mats outside my backyard so I can train with the dummy and not be afraid to fall.  Can any good mats for this scenario? 




 Despite whatever his true intentions are, he's been such a great mentor and family, even, to Caitlin, Cisco, and especially, Barry. While Eobard Thawne may be a genius who can easily cover his tracks and manipulates other people to his advantage, I honestly want to say that he genuinely does care about everyone in Star Labs, at least to some degree.

I'm really going to miss him giving sage advice to Barry and being a mentor and a true friend to him - even, if it's mostly all an act to get what he wants.

"We all want you to stay because we love you too... now, I am not a parent.  But, in many ways, you have shown me what it's like to have a son." 




 Always mind boggled me how some skinny guys (low bodyfat, lean) don't have low enough bf % to have a six pack showing.  Remember a lot of guys on the HS Cross Country team being really lean but not having a six pack.  Does that mean their bodyfat isn't low enough or...?

 To train in the ''Blue Belt'' program (Gracie Combatives) at the Gracie Academy in Beverly Hills is $130 for 4x a month and $160 for 6x a month. Each combatives class is an hour long.

How can a student expect to improve very much with only four hours of training a month?

My BJJ school is $100/month for 5 days of training/week. I definitely would not be able to afford the GA training and I know for a fact that it would take me forever to reach Blue Belt had I been limited to training for only 4x a month (due to cost).

Imo, once again, Hollywood has changed the lead Asian character to "half-white" in order to appeal to major audiences.  

Same reason why David Carradine replaced Bruce Lee as the lead role in *Kung Fu* and the original Chinese character was changed to half-white - because Hollywood cannot have an oriental face playing the lead role.

My only problem with him is he doesn't look Asian at all: https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/rush-hour-pilot-cast.jpg?w=300 h=208 crop=1 




 It just seems like an illogical thing to do since they're just dehydrating themselves in an environment where water isn't as easily accessed.

I went on a field trip to an animal research facility for a Biology class and one of the caretakers were showing us a Desert Tortoise and explained that they release their fluids when nervous or scared (which it did a total of 4 times on the Caretaker while she was holding it).

 Knifehand strikes, deep stances, back fists, etc. are incorporated in various Taegeuk Poomses. However, they are never practiced in sparring. What is the purpose in learning these various blocks and strikes in forms if we cannot apply them in live combat? 



















 Does this quote really apply to BJJ? A lot of martial artists will say that a Black Belt only demonstrates mastery over the basics. This may be true in styles of Martial Arts where you can obtain a Black Belt in 2-3 years, but in BJJ, where it can take over a decade, I believe that congratulating a BJJ Practitioner on their Black Belt and saying, "Now you know the basics!," is an insult to their hard work and dedication.

I understand the meaning of the quote is humility but I, personally, would feel that if someone ever told me that upon being promoted to Black Belt, I would feel that they're undermining my training a bit.

 In all of the Buu Saga, Gohan transformed into a Super Saiyan 2 only once to fight against Kibito.  However, after he was ambushed and had his power drained by Spovovitch   Yamu, we never see him ascend to this level ever again.  Even in his following match against Dabura, Gohan only ascended to his first Super Saiyan state.

In Battle of the Gods, before going Ultimate, Gohan only transformed into a Super Saiyan as well, no further.

Why has Gohan neglected his ability to transform into a Super Saiyan 2, or is it rather he no longer has access to that transformation?

From what we've seen in the trailer for *Revival of F*, it doesn't look like Gohan ascends to Super Saiyan 2 either.

It's rather disappointing to see him no longer use a transformation that was so hyped up from the moment his character was introduced.  The battles against Cell   Bojack as a Super Saiyan 2 were epic.

EDIT: Downvotes? I'm new to this subreddit   I just wanted to have a little discussion... 









 Blocks like this: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/EVD-kumite-042.jpg

I've practiced them all the time in Taekwondo, Shaolin Kempo,   Karate. Down Blocks, High Blocks, Inside Blocks, Outside Blocks, Out-To-In Block, In-To-Out, Knifehand Blocks etc. are mostly used in forms or traditional "One-Step" Sparring Drills. However, we never use them as a part of sparring (expect maybe Down   High Block for Roundhouse Kicks) and I have no idea what the practicality or application of these would be in a street self-defense scenario or any kind of fighting scenario.

Are these blocks just for show? Are they practical at all?

I found a video of a TKD Instructor explaining how to use an Inside Block against a Punch but I find just moving out the way or parrying to be much more practical: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKfimAcKL5w spfreload=10

 According to Saiky Jump's June 2014 interview with Akira Toriyama:

Goku endlessly keeps getting stronger, with Super Saiyan 3 in the manga and Super Saiyan 4 in the anime; does Super Saiyan keep getting limitlessly stronger too? Might we eventually see things such as a Super Saiyan 5?!
Super Saiyan 2 and 3 are nothing more than powered-up variations of Super Saiyan. After the fight with Beerus, Goku realized that mastering his normal state and Super Saiyan would raise his level more and sap less strength, so I think he probably wont become Super Saiyan 2 or 3 any more.

Super Saiyan 2 was already hyped down in the Buu Saga in favor of Super Saiyan 3,   now we won't even get to see Super Saiyan 3 anymore? I was really disappointed that Super Saiyan 3 didn't play a big role in BoTG. I thought it was amazing as a finisher in Wrath of the Dragon. Thoughts   opinions?

I've always wanted to see Frieza's personal reaction to Goku unlocking higher levels of the Super Saiyan transformation and I'd be disappointed if Goku doesn't demonstrate his new forms in Revival of F.  I may get a lot of hate for this but I thought the Super Saiyan God transformation's appearance looked ridiculous.

Also, does anyone want to see Gohan go Super Saiyan 2 again like in the Wolrd Tournament? We can tell by BoTG that he still has the option of going either Super Saiyan or "Ultimate/Mystic." By the trailer, it looks like he goes Super Saiyan but will he ascend to Super Saiyan 2?

 




 Hi everyone, I'm test_subject387.  I lurk around a lot in this sub   I've made some posts every now and then.  
In one of my threads many people went over an argument over a hypothetical situation regarding how well Bruce Lee would do in a fight versus a modern day fighter. I might get a lot of hate for this but there were a lot of misconceptions on both sides and I just wanted to express my opinion on them. I'd be grateful if you took the time to read before expressing your opinion.  And while I'm a HUGE Bruce Lee fan, this **is not** a "why Bruce Lee is the Greatest Martial Artist of All Time" post so I tried to keep everything closer to facts rather than opinion.

**Who is Bruce Lee?**


Bruce Lee is one of, if not *the*, most well-known martial artists of all time. He is famous for his short film career which left a global impact on the world, especially with *Enter the Dragon* being the first Hollywood produced Kung-Fu flick. 

**So, he's just an action star?**


Aside from being a kickass movie star, Bruce Lee was a father, a husband, a dancer, and a life-long martial artist - being the founder of his own hybrid-martial art, Jeet Kune Do.

Bruce's philosophy on the martial arts for his time were considered radical. The notion of breaking out of what he considered "set styles" in order to become a complete martial artist through means of cross-training by taking what is useful   rejecting what isn't was revolutionary.  As a side note, Dana White, the President of the UFC, credits Bruce as being the "Godfather of Mixed Martial Arts."

What was unique about Bruce was that he studied various styles of martial arts, starting with Wing Chun and expanding onto Western Boxing, Jiujitsu, Savate, Judo and more. He used his knowledge to create, in his own vision, the most practical   efficient method of self-defense for street-fighting scenarios.  The hybrid martial arts style   philosophy of *Jeet Kune Do* is his legacy.

His books, "The Tao of Jeet Kune Do," "The Art of Expressing the Human Body,"   "Bruce Lee's Fighting Method" illustrated his training methods and personal fitness routine.  Bruce's ideologies on weight training and exercise focused on making his body as functional as possible for fighting - keeping himself light, flexible,   strong in order to hit fast and hard.  His personal method of fighting focused on economy of movement, for example, he favors the lead leg, southpaw stance because, in his opinion, Bruce believed that the strongest side should be the side you put forward.  The Jab, whether it be in the form of a kick or punch, is the shortest distance between you   your opponent and therefore, it should be used with your strongest side forward.

Everything should be efficient, he believed. 

His his own words, the best definition of his own interpretation of efficiency in fighting would be a glass of water. 

*"Water is the softest substance in the world, yet it can penetrate the hardest rock.  Water is also insubstantial. By that I mean you cannot grasp hold of it, you cannot punch it and hurt it."*

*"Be formless. Shapeless, like water. If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle. You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now, water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend."*

tl;dr: A fighter must be fluid, ready to adapt to any opponent. 

**So you're saying the guy was a fighter? Prove it. There's no professional record of him in existence.**


I want to make it clear.  It is *obvious* that Bruce Lee was no professional fighter.  Aside from winning a High School Boxing Tournament while in Hong Kong and various alleged streetfights, there is no existing fighting record regarding Bruce Lee.  Also, other than demonstration footage and low quality training footage, there is not very much visual evidence to cite his level of skill.  

However, the man trained his entire life to be the most efficient fighter he can possibly be - always reaching to surpass his limits.  As Linda Lee stated in the documentary, *"I Am Bruce Lee,"* Bruce would always play flipped footage of Muhammed Ali (because Lee is a Southpaw) and analyze his movements hoping to fight him one day.  While it sounds ridiculous to compare Lee to professional champions past   present, it just goes to show that Lee would have taken any challenge thrown at him.  The man was not afraid to prove himself.  So was he a professional fighter?  Not by any means but does this mean he wasn't a fighter?  I'll leave it up to you with this analogy: If you practice martial arts but never compete, are you still considered a fighter?

**How do you think Bruce Lee would do in the Modern MMA world?**

Bruce Lee was a complete martial artist.  He studied various styles of striking along with grappling as evidenced in his illustrations and notes printed in *"The Tao of Jeet Kune Do."* Bruce's philosophies of taking what is useful   rejecting what isn't when regarding cross-training is the underlying definition of what MMA is.  However, MMA is a sport that has evolved through hundreds of bouts.  In order to be a good MMA Fighter, one must train under the rulesets of the sport to maximize what they can do in the cage.

Simply put, while having trained in and mixed various styles of martial arts, Bruce Lee is not an "MMA" Fighter.  Modern Mixed Martial Arts is the epitome of how martial arts have evolved over time to the highest level suited for the cage and, as stated earlier, Bruce Lee wasn't training for that kind of environment.

It's still fun though to speculate how Bruce would've done against modern fighters in and out of his would-be weight division, but at the end of the day, Bruce wasn't training for a competition-style environment.


**You still haven't answered the question, would Bruce Lee do well in the UFC?**

In today's UFC roster with the skills   knowledge he had before his death? Probably not. The sport has evolved into a mix of striking and grappling suited for the rules of the cage.  However, it would've been interesting to see how he would've done in the early UFC Tournaments where it was still style v. style.  In my opinion, Bruce's diverse arsenal of techniques would've taken him far in those early tournaments. 

**In Conclusion?**


Bruce Lee isn't some sort of unbeatable God of a fighter or anything along those lines nor did he claim himself to be.  He was, however, a highly-respected martial artist that was ahead of his time, the founder of Jeet Kune Do, an international movie star, and a family man.

**Anything else?**

I wanted to repost an old comment of mine from /r/mma where there was a argument that Bruce was just an actor and nothing else.  While it repeats some of the things I've stated above, it also goes into detail on some of the topics I touched on.  It has to do a lot with Bruce's *actual fighting style* as opposed to what we've seen on-screen in the movies.  Regarding that subject here is my personal opinion on it:

A lot of people on /r/MMA will claim that Bruce Lee was an actor and nothing else, which is inaccurate. Bruce, before anything else, was a Martial Artist. The techniques and philosophies that he trained in and preached were definitely revolutionary for his time. The ideas of taking what is useful and rejecting what isn't, how styles are a crystallization, and to be a complete martial artist - one must cover all their bases were ingenious and are what Modern MMA Fighters apply today.
A lot of people will say Bruce was a flashy fighter, but what they don't realize is his on-screen style is completely different from what he preaches for fighting. He just knew what would look nice on camera, and obviously what looks nice on camera may be less than applicable in real, live fighting.
Bruce's fighting style emphasized economy of movement. His books, "The Tao of Jeet Kune Do" and "Bruce Lee's Fighting Method," which explains his ideas regarding fighting, are very scientific. His concepts were very unique, for example, he puts his strong side forward instead of back because he believes that the lead leg and the lead hand should be your strongest side for it covers the least amount of distance required to reach your opponent.
A "signature" move in a lot of his movies is the Spinning Heel Kick, AKA "Dragon Whips His Tail." However, in his book, "Bruce Lee's Fighting Method," he claims that the technique is too high risk in order to rely on and favors the Turning Back Kick when regarding kicks. The Turning Back Kick is now a common move taught in Muay Thai striking for MMA Fighters and many fighters have utilized it in their fighting career. It really shows how he favors realism, applicability, and practicality over flashy theatrics when it comes to real fighting. Not to say flashy moves do not work, we've seen plenty of instances where "spinning shit" ends in knockouts, but they're risky moves and Bruce favored what was more reliable.
What's ironic is Bruce actually preferred low kicks to high kicks because they're easier to land and you have more targets: the kneecap, the groin, the solar plexus, the liver, etc.
Also, regarding grappling which is a staple of MMA, Bruce's book shows that he had researched Judo and Jiu-Jitsu and the illustrations in the book portray various submissions such as chokeholds and armbars along with throws.

-If you've made it this far without wanting to Spin Kick my face off, I just want to thank you for taking the time to read my post. I'm happy to hear any and all of your comments and opinions whether positive or negative. Thanks again :)

EDIT: Grammar, clarity, etc. 
Had the urge to write this on a short notice, sorry if it's sloppy. 









 Aside from all these crazy memes, I've heard people say he's a World Karate Champion or something along those lines and that's how Bruce Lee came into contact with him but I've never seen anyone post any actual sparring footage or competition footage of him fighting. Is Chuck Norris legit? Anyone seen any good videos of him fighting? (No movies) 









 I noticed that my flexibility is compromised especially the day after the day I do squats (I try to go as deep as possible without compromising form). My legs are sore, I'm slower, I'm stiff and it takes a lot more effort to kick high and even when I try I don't think I can kick high as I can prior to leg day.

A lot of the guys at my gym have a rule that they don't lift any weights the week of competition to avoid any type of lagging soreness and I think I'm going to adopt that rule. 

How would you stop weightlifting from compromising your flexibility and freedom of movement?

I'm currently doing Stronglifts 5x5 for my weightlifting regime which focuses on full body workouts based on major compound exercises such as Squat, Deadlift,   Bench Press.

 Where he fights a guy who predominantly uses consecutive chains of punches, Chan just slaps or parries them out of the way until he can find an opening. 

What style of Martial Art practices that? I noticed it's used a lot in Chan's modern Kung Fu-oriented films as well as other martial arts genre movies.

I know boxers practice parries, but nothing to that level.

Also, is this a real technique or is it just for show?

I don't think it's Wing Chun, though the description sounds like it is.

He also uses various "Traditional" Martial Arts blocks against punches, the kind of blocks you see in a form.

I've always been impressed by how inventive Chan uses those blocks in the choreography of his movies and wondered if those blocks would actually work in a real fight.

On a short notice, I can't find an incredible sequence from him but I managed to pull this short scene out of Supercop. It demonstrates the traditional martial arts blocks I talked about earlier and the hand slap blocks early in the clip.

 Am I a bad person? 




 Yeah, I agree. Would it make any sense to ask for the gas money that he bailed out on giving repeatedly in the past?  




 17 over. Is it worth mentioning that he lived 25 minutes away? 




 Well, he was pretty far from my current location at the time.  His work place was near where I was and he lived 25 minutes away. So going the limit would take 50 minutes to get him to work which he would then have to change out and what not which would make him late. I think that's worth mentioning. 




 So, I was in the middle of an errand when my friend texted me saying he needed a ride to work. Finished my errand at 10:10 and he has to clock in at work at 11:00 so I immediately drove to his house. He told me to step on it so he won't be late and, stupidly, I did and I ended up getting a speeding ticket. I figured he would be understanding and feel bad and offer to help me out when I got to his house and told him (Stupid me) but he just shook it off and practically said, "tough luck, bud." What pissed me off the most was right after, he had the audacity to tell me to hurry so he won't be late. Ended up getting to him to work in time.


Ticket came home to be $367 and I'm falling very short as I just paid for my classes for next semester.
tl;dr:


-Friend Asked for a Ride to Work, I agreed


-He told me to step on it, I got a speeding ticket


-He had the audacity to tell me to hurry RIGHT AFTER I got a ticket so he wouldn't be late to work. Also, he didn't even pay for gas...


-Got him to work on time at the cost of $367.


-Would it be okay for me to ask him to help pay for it? If so, what should I say? 




 I was just trying to help him out and I paid the consequences for doing so. I know. I'm not saying it's not my fault. 




 50 MPH, I was going 17 over.

My friend also lives 25 minutes away from where I was at the time and it would've taken us the same amount of time to get to his workplace.

 




 Yeah, you're right. I guess I just felt rushed at the moment and didn't want him to get in trouble at work. I'm not saying it's not my fault, though. 




 It wouldn't be reasonable at all? :/

And I was just trying to help him the entire time. 




 Doing some community service early in the morning. 




 Even if you specifically told them to step on it? 




 I'm not asking him to pay for all of it.  But he skipped out on giving me gas money for giving him rides several times in the midst of my own schedule and it would be *very nice* of him to chip in to some degree. 




 So, I was in the middle of an errand when my friend texted me saying he needed a ride to work. Finished my errand at 10:10 and he has to clock in at work at 11:00 so I immediately drove to his house. He told me to step on it so he won't be late and, stupidly, I did and I ended up getting a speeding ticket. I figured he would be understanding and feel bad and offer to help me out when I got to his house and told him (Stupid me) but he just shook it off and practically said, "tough luck, bud." What pissed me off the most was right after, he had the audacity to tell me to hurry so he won't be late. Ended up getting to him to work in time.


Ticket came home to be $367 and I'm falling very short as I just paid for my classes for next semester.


tl;dr:


-Friend Asked for a Ride to Work, I agreed


-He told me to step on it, I got a speeding ticket


-He had the audacity to tell me to hurry RIGHT AFTER I got a ticket so he wouldn't be late to work. Also, he didn't even pay for gas...


-Got him to work on time at the cost of $367.


-Would it be okay for me to ask him to help pay for it? If so, what should I say?

I see him at work in a few hours and he is moving soon. 









 So will getting accepted in medical school be more difficult, than it already is, if you're Asian? 




 How different can a Green Arrow costume be from "The Arrow" costume? They're both green. 




 Not very covert, though. IMO. 




 Do you think he planned to end up as the Demon's Head? 




 We saw her in the living in one of the promos leading up to the finale. 




 Where did she stutter on "b-but" Oliver?

The actual dialogue went:

"...thousands of people in this city will die."

"What? No. Ray! Oliver!!!" 




 Anyone else also think it's bullshit they killed off Sara in the first episode? 




 Tell me, do you even die? *You will*. 




 No, not Core-ah; Care-ah. 




 Same reason Spectacular Spider-Man was killed off. 




 it shrinks to fit duh 




 I thought it was Care-ah not Car-ah 




 time mark? 




 Does anyone else feel like this is the easy way out? Kind of clich. 

I want a twist. 




 Hey, /r/advice, I was really hoping you guys could help me out. I've been stressed out lately trying to deal with my mother.


Let me give some background info before jumping into it, first. I'm an 18 year guy and until recently have never had a girlfriend or anything close. In High School I was kind of shy and socially awkward when it came to talking to girls. It doesn't help that my parents come from a foreign country and how they think that "getting good grades in class" equates to getting girls to like me. So... yeah.


Anyways, I decided to make a change ever since I started college last fall. I've acted more confident, got a job, started making new friends and talking to girls. Oh yeah, I've never really had many close friends. Never hung out with anyone much because I wanted to avoid having anyone over in fear of my mom's awkwardness. (I brought one friend, who was a guy, over one time and she kept peeking in for whatever reason all awkwardly when we were hanging out in the living room)


So yeah. Lately, I've been bringing friends over to the house to study and hang out afterwards - usually in my room but sometimes on the dinner table too if we both need extra space for our assignments, books, and what not. Surprisingly, my parents were cool with it. They haven't barged in or anything like that or bothered us at all. It's like I'm having a social life for the first time in my life and, to be honest, I really like it. I've spent most of my teenage years shut in my room and browsing the internet and it's been kind of lonely to be honest.
So, I don't know how it happened but I somehow convinced a girl to give me a chance to take her out for a date. We had a great time and I've been seeing her a lot lately. Never really talked to my parents about her but we've been going out on dates frequently and, honestly, I like her a lot.


About two weeks while we were hanging out after classes - we were talking about the new Furious 7 movie, I talked about asking her to come over to watch a Fast   Furious marathon with me before we go see the movie in theaters together. She said she'd be down to come over right then since she didn't have plans for the rest of the day. I texted my parents I was having a friend over and when she came over I introduced her to them. Afterwards I took her to my room and set up the movie and I left to use the restroom. When I got back I noticed my mom talking to her and then left right before I got back to my room. I asked her what my mom said and she said that my mom asked if we wanted to hang out in the living room. In my head I'm like, "what the heck, mom?" Way to put her on the spot.


So during the first movie, my mom knocked on the door and told me it wasn't good for my friend to be over this late and I told her that my friend's own mother was fine with it since she (my friend) told her parents before she decided to swing by.


Anyways, we went through the first movie and got halfway through the second before one thing led to another and we ended up having sex. Afterward, I checked the time and it was still pretty early (About 8:30ish) and I took her home so my parents wouldn't complain and so her own parents wouldn't worry. My friend's mom was really impressed I cared about her that much.


Next morning I have a talk with my mom about last night and, surprisingly, she acted very calm about it. She said everything that I'm doing is perfectly normal for an 18 year old (btw my mom's a nurse) and she just pointed out to make sure we were having protected sex if we decided to do it. Awesome, right?


A couple days later after I brought her over again to study and hangout. Of course, I told my parents before doing so. She came over and we were hanging out in the living room with the movie on and me doing my assignment. After awhile I finished my assignment and noticed how uncomfortable she looked - just hanging out on the floor. I asked her if she just wanted to go hang out in my room since she looked like she was having trouble getting comfortable by lying in a bunch of weird positions lol. So we went back to my room and just watched the movie there. About 15 minutes in I get a call from my dad saying that mom wants to talk to me so I excuse myself and go over to my parents room and my mom was absolutely furious that I took her back to my room?


She was mad that I told her we were going to study and went to my room but... I told my mom I finished the assignment. Also, it's not like we couldn't study inside my room, right? Anyways she threw a fit and demanded she get out of my room so I decided to just leave the house with my friend... When I got back - my mom was arguing with my dad about the whole situation.


Since then I've only been allowed to bring her over if we go to the living room and even when I do my mom is extremely irritated about it. Last time I brought her over, when we walked through the front doors - my friend greeted my mom and my mom just pointed to the living room while saying, "I know what's best for you (my name here)."


It's been like this ever since and it's destroying my relationship with this girl. I don't like bringing her over anymore because there's an awkward tension in the household and it sucks because I can't go over to her house either (for temporary reasons I shouldn't disclose). Because of this when we do hang out we usually go out to eat which sucks because we have to spend money over and over if we want a nice indoors place to see each other.


I've had several male friends over since to study for finals with and my parents haven't said anything but my mom freaks out and throws a huge fit which irritates the hell out of my dad because she will bitch at him for not being able to "control his son."


So, finally I had enough and confronted my mom about this and asked her why it was okay for me to bring guys into my room yet I can't bring a girl into my room. I explained that I thought it was because my mom believed we would be constantly having sex. I also pointed out that, like I said earlier, my mother was fine with that. Anyways... my mom just wouldn't give me a reason other than "I know what's best for you." She also pointed out that she hates me having people over. (Which is clearly a lie because she never says anything when guys are over) So yeah, no explanation - no nothing.


Please help me. I've had a taste of what having a social life felt like and it was great. I don't want my mother to ruin this for me. 




 "ok bruce, first step. Im gonna shot your parents while you watch"



*gonna shot*

Wow.

 Thea is Arsenal now. Makes sense because in the comics, Speedy becomes Arsenal. 




 Damn, that feels like so long ago. 




 To move the plot forward for Speedy (Thea) to become Arsenal. This is why Flash writers  Arrow writers. 




 swerve? 




 Hey, /r/legaladvice, I'm in a predicament right now and I was hoping you guys could help. I got a speeding ticket a month ago and I got the okay to do traffic school and work the point off my record. Unfortunately, I just got in another one today (got peer-pressured into going fast to give my friend a lift to work). I told the officer my situation and he seemed considerate   offered to ask for a reduction for me. Unfortunately, I still got a ticket.


However, I explained the fact that I hadn't yet done my traffic school yet for the first ticket and I'm still within the 60 day deadline (or so, it ends on the 22nd of May). He told me that I should try to *"cheat the system"* and though I'm *"not supposed"* (he kept repeating it) to, he recommended that I put traffic school for the first ticket on hold  , since I don't yet have the "traffic school completion" on my record yet, that I should request traffic school again since the 18 month delay between traffic school eligibility hasn't been set.


There's no guarantee it'd work, but he says if it does that I could potentially get both points off my record. The whole thing seems sketchy to me but I figured the most I could lose out of it was 1 point and the most I could benefit by trying is having no points at all.
Also, the officer offered to ask for a reduction for me when I show up to court but I was planning on showing up earlier than the deadline date so I could still request traffic school - and if happen to get it, I could finish both before the deadline for my first traffic school ticket expires. I'm not sure how that would work though, would I have to contact him to let him know ahead? I got his name on my ticket but I believe that was about it.


Honestly, I'm more worried about the points though.


Hopefully, that wasn't at all confusing   you guys could offer some advice. Thanks a lot, guys :)


One last thing, what I've learned out of this is that you have to weigh the pros and cons of speeding. If speeding a couple minutes off getting to your destination is worth a couple hundred dollars in tickets and a thousand in insurance bumps is worth it - than by all means, go ahead. But, more than likely, most of the time you're better off going the limit and driving safe. For me, I should've done the latter for both situations.

Also... I just don't understand why he'd offer me to advice on how to cheat the system after giving me a ticket.  Quotas?  




 Can you get any money from this? 




 Do they not lock the doors while the Flash is hanging about? 




 Someone should make Mayweather read this. 




 So I didn't have time to comment earlier but after reviewing your video again I think you definitely deserve a lot more.  In my opinion, you displayed much more technical skill than your opponent.  As someone who has also had experience fighting against higher belts that're much bigger, this trait is a necessity in order to win as you must outsmart/skill your opponent to make up for any size/strength disadvantages. 

 You have great technique when it came to your Tornado Kicks, but like I said earlier - you must focus on baiting your opponent out in order for a kick like that to land, especially a kick like that.  Offensive Spinning Kicks have a much lower accuracy than counter-offensive.  Improving your footwork will also help you bait out your opponent.  

You took a lot more valid hits than he did - not because he's necessarily better, but you took some illegal hits earlier which affected your game and that you seemed to be waiting for an opening. 

Watch the boundaries, try not to step out of the mat.  Impose your will over your opponent rather than the other way around so if he pushes forward, you push right back with a forward attack or a counter instead of just backing up.  You want to be more dominant than he is.  

With all that said, I just want to commend you for a great first fight and I encourage you to keep training hard and compete.  I see your spirit in the ring and if you keep at it - you will be great.  Thank you for sharing your experience with us. :) 




 Great Spin Kicks.  Work on baiting and you'll be landing and scoring those more often. 




 Plot Twist: That guy kicks as hard as Superman. 




 Thank you based god. 




 Beards don't impress women? I hear about women complimenting beards and shaming mustaches all the time via social media. 




 Pretty much this. 




 The Hangover Part 2. 









 He's so fake. 




 A "good" cop tells, for lack of a better word, on a "bad" cop and all of the other bad cops can intimidate that cop and his family. 

That's what happened to Jim Gordon in Batman: Year One.  Jim Gordon was one of the few good cops in a corrupt department and he was ambushed and beat up for trying to do the right thing.  The corrupt officers also threatened his pregnant wife.

EDIT: This is the reason why we need a Batman. 




 Why do they? 




 NOS as in Nitrous Oxide System? 




 Nice rhyming!!!!!! 




 Thanks for killing it for us. 




 What episode was this!??? 




 Did Eobard watch Iris and Eddie have sex on one of those surveillance cams? 









 That site took forever to load. 




 Is it just me or does the site not have the video anymore? 




 Holy shit, my current TKD Dojang is $75 a month. 




 Thank you for the explanation. 




 So what would a Spinning Back Kick be described as in Karate? 




 We should ask Chris Weidman for lessons on checking leg kicks. 




 That was a Spinning Hook Kick.

I don't understand why people mix these kicks up.  A Back Kick travels in a straight line.  It's like confusing a cross with a hook.

i don't understand. can someone explain? 




 This was posted a week ago. 




 Could it be useful or is it too slow/situational/etc.? 









 ok, assume we whack a hammer on my hand vs lay something on it that has the same lbs as a hammer after calculating the force of the swing with the weight of the hammer. Would it both feel the same?  




 Nah, not consistent. Amazing Spider-Man 2 was so trash that they're going to reboot the series a third time. 




 Thank you for the explanation and the example. 




 But "lbs of force" as a force unit and "lbs" as a unit of mass can be equal if they both weigh in at the same number, right? 




 If someone can kick at "3,000 lbs of force" would that be the same as saying their kick weighs in at 3,000 lbs? 




 Early 2000's? Spider-Man was pretty good. 




 DAE hate when they get a cart that won't steer straight and keeps moving to the left/right? 




 The dumb character design for the Robin girl killed it for me along with the whole generic Mutant Gang.  But yeah, I agree the story is good but the actual details were lacking imo.  Hopefully Dawn of Justice is a lot more entertaining and draws me into the story.

Haven't had a DC Movie glue my eyes to the screen since The Dark Knight.

 WHAT THE HELL. I POSTED THE SAME QUESTION AN HOUR EARLIER AND IT GOT REMOVED http://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3309px/regarding_the_new_batman_v_superman_movie/ 




 Just finished watching both parts of the movie adaptation of TDKR.  it was alright... 




 Speedforce. 




 He wore the mech suit throughout the story?

Which book? 









 Will he be wearing the mech suit throughout the movie? I prefer the classic Batman costume. 

I'm guessing the mech suit is just to fight Superman? 




 Will he be wearing the mech suit throughout the movie? I prefer the classic Batman costume. 

I'm guessing the mech suit is just to fight Superman? 




 lol its slanted 




 thats racist. 




 what's that mean? 




 Uhm... Karate, Judo, BJJ, and JJJ also wear a Gi to fight in competition. 




 Grant Gustin seems a bit shorter than Stephen Amell.  However, imbd lists Gustin as an inch taller than Amell. 




  It drove him insane when he found out he was fated to become his arch nemesis

I mean, with that knowledge he could've just rationally altered history by making his decision to *not* become the Flash's arch nemesis. 




 It's traditional to wear the White, formal "Gi/Dobok" to fight in competition. 




 American Karate: Rednecks.

Damn. This has gotta be the most honest statement in all of /r/martialarts. 




 Karate Gi's and Taekwondo Doboks, compared to Judo/JJJ/BJJ Gi's, are made of thin material for a good "snap" sound whenever you punch or kick.  Because of this, if you try to grapple with them - they'll tear.

Judo/JJJ/BJJ Gi's are designed to take a beating with them being pulled and tugged for throws, submissions and what not so therefore, they are weaved much thicker than Karate/Taekwondo/Etc. Uniforms.

EDIT: One's heavy and the other is light. 




 You realize Gi's for Grappling Arts and Gi's for Striking Arts are different right? 




 DUDE.  It costs **a dollar** and it can save your **life.** 




 Where can I read this at? 




 Honestly, this.  What the fuck. 




 The Chest Gear is how they score points.  It's electronic.  




 I meant why are they wearing Gi's when it's not a grappling sport?


Why do Karate guys wear Gi's when it's not a grappling sport? 




 As of 2015:

Kicks/Punches to the Body = 1 Point

Spinning Kicks to the Body = 3 Points

Kicks to the Head = 3 Points

Spinning Kicks to the Head = 4 Points 




 It's full-contact sparring, actually. 
























 That was really obvious, I'm surprised OP didn't notice 




 Just because he's wearing a black suit, you're assuming he has a large penis? Wow. 




 So it was that vendetta not the fact that he found out he was going to become the Flash's enemy by going back in the past that drove him to become the Flash's enemy?  




 What was Barry doing in the 25th century? 




 Why so fucking long between seasons? 




 Wells said Barry's body could lead to vaccines and stuff. Why did they never go through with this research? 




 Wow Joe was so harsh on Barry. Joe was so adamant that Barry's dad killed Barry's mom. 









 This. 




 What episode is this?? 




 This is quote from my thread. 

Obviously, he does travel back in time to fight the Flash and ruin his life BUT this was before he finds out he was his greatest enemy. 




 same 




 Does that include twerking? 




 Same. I was looking forward to seeing more of that after the pilot but NO. 




 In the comics, Eobard Thawne (Professor Zoom/Reverse Flash) was a huge Flash fan and travelled back in time to meet Barry Allen. However, he miscalculated and ended up in a time after Barry Allen died and discovered that he was destined to become Barry Allen's greatest enemy which drove him crazy.  

My question is... how would he be destined to become Barry Allen's greatest enemy if he was born after Barry Allen died? (Obviously, he does travel back in time to fight the Flash and ruin his life BUT this was before he finds out he was his greatest enemy.)

Hopefully this question makes sense.  It's something that always has bothered me about Eobard Thawne's background.

EDIT: Fuck you downvotes. It was a genuine question. 




 did he get fired? 




 Stealth Mode suit. 




 Your EDIT and your TIL are the same thing 




 At 5'5'', he's taller than Captain America. (Steve Rogers, Pre-Serum) 




 Nice artwork! 




 I'm fucking astonished at this man's logic. Read a fucking book.

 Not God, Grodd. 




 Yeah, a costume like that wouldn't be flattering for her frame.

Dem hips in the pic though. Goddamn. 




 Why not?

 You got ripped off on that meal plan, my friend. I would be quite disappointed if I were you.

 I'm glad you're still around friend :)

 was that movie bad or something 




 Did you punish /u/technologicalbrian ? 




 Sara was the closest thing we'll get to that 




 I think that the only reason I will watch this show is because Kara is really cute.

[NSFW] [She looks cuter when she's about to get fucked.](http://thefappening.so/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Melissa-Benoist-Naked-02.jpg) 




 Cliche evil twin. 




 The boss makes me want to quit watching this show. Bitch, you're not hot. 




 That brings me hope. Olicity must die. 




 what the hell 




 should've allowed the voices and sound effects to play simultaneously like the first few dialogues from braniac-luthor 




 Laurel's full name is Dinah Laurel Lance. Laurel is Dinah. 









 that's how it happens in the comics 




 so much leather 




 Read the title. 




 I wonder why so many fans are pushing for the brighter red suit with the white emblem then. 




 And blacks getting killed by white cops, amirite? 




 Happy Cake Day. 




 Not all Asians are racist /: 




 Holy shit, I stopped playing for a little over a year and Raigeki is unbanned? 




 How did he get her if Barry created her though? Obviously Barry created her for his own use 




 Anyway, why does the timeline not reset when Eddie shoots himself?

It can't because, by killing himself, Eddie created an infinite loop paradox so the whole timeline decided to collapse on itself by creating a black hole. 









 the second one looks way better. 




 Vibrating hand of death. 




 I bet it was because he was also affected that night when the Particle Accelerator exploded. 




 So which was the majority!? Darker or Same???? 




 Yeah I was like what the hell 




 Did I ever mention that it wasn't my fault? 




 Too masculine. Couldn't tell it was a female. 




 Forget two weeks, a few hours is enough for middle-eastern blood. 




 This thread has negative 2 comments LMAO.

But, yeah just watch the first two seasons of Arrow in order then watch Arrow season 3 and start Flash Season 1 simultaneously with watching Flash episodes before Arrow episodes. It all lines up in order. 




 If only it was a darker red like the costume. 




 Looks like a rotten banana. 




 I dunno, Flash and Arrow had more enjoyable pilots, imo.

I don't like the clich "anti-hero" hates protagonist up until protagonist saves his/her life or something along those lines.

Jimmy Olsen was always a young comic relief character in the comics/DCAU continuity.    he's a grown ass black man here which makes me wonder what Lois Lane looks like.

But, hey, the effects are decent. 




 No, there were 3 Barry's BEFORE our Barry time-travelled.  There were 4 Barry's in the finale.  Young Barry, Future Barry (who came back to save his mother and his younger self), Future Barry (who went back in time again after Flashpoint events from saving his mother to stop his younger self from saving his mother), and Our Barry. 




 Definitely not on-par with Arrow/Flash. Probably won't end up in the same universe. 




 Welcome to the Hotel California 




 Fuck you 









 Technically, he   other Barry *are the same person*. 




 Time Travel won't be invented until 30 years from now. 




 Never grew wisdom teeth and I never will. 




 no one saw.

Except Sasuke, right? That was one of the reasons he gave into receiving Cursed Seal LV. 2. 




 I mean if Naruto can become Hokage without ever promoting from Genin, I wouldn't say it's impossible for Lee to promote to whatever he wants. 




 An auto reply replied by an auto reply replied by an auto reply replied by an auto reply? Would've made sense if it was 3 times and not 4. 




 It says there are seeds on the site though with the info on the right (you know what i mean) 




 Yeah these torrents are pretty old about two or three years. 




 Good bye, Dad. 




 So, basically - no Flashpoint confirmed.

Great analysis, I too had my theories that there were possibly four Barrys in that room and this all makes sense.  




 I'm excited for what's to come.  Do you think we'll be seeing the white emblem costume again in Season 2? 




 AGREED 




 Yes Cisco 




 I just noticed the similarity between the two endings. 




 Why were the same two tweets posted twice? That confused me for a minute. 




 Her teeth appear to be quite big for her mouth size. 




 Do you think it'd be a mix of a Dynamic Timeline as well as the Multiverse Model? One could theorize that the reason Future Barry knew where, our, Present Barry was immediately and told him not to follow through with his plans was because Future Barry had already gone through the events of Flashpoint and not only went back in time, once again, to save his younger self but to also prevent his past self to ensue the events of Flashpoint in the first place.

Thus, a loop? 




 4 minutes in and this thread already got downvoted multiple times... what's wrong guys? 




 Infinite loop 




 Why would he choose not to have the life he always dreamed of...? That was the biggest plot twist for me. 









 I can't download anything. 




 The show *just had its* finale, so it won't be on Netflix till the Fall.

FTFY. Sorry, was bothering me while reading it.
 




 Let's call him a distant relative. 




 My name... is Eobard Thawne. -nod- 




 Any good? 




 Your comment just fucked my brain. 




 LOL. that was so unexpected. thought you were gonna say he was retarded or something 




 yes. 




 And, if so, does that mean no possibility for updated suit? :( 




 And a much brighter red! 




 That makes a lot of sense, thank you friend. Any chance we're gonna see our Barry get Future Barry's suit in Season 2? 




 So, Future Flash has already experienced the Flashpoint events? 




 the only thing that bugs me when i first saw it and that still bugs me now seeing it again is the mouth. 




 That makes a lot of sense, thank you very much friend. 




 Thank you for the great analysis and explanation. 




 /u/samx3i do you believe that season 2 will explore Earth-2? 




 And for those who never watched Smallville, what exactly is that? 




 Poor Barry. Couldn't save his mom. 

More like "chose not to save his mom."
 




 Not god, grodd. 




 Dat singularity. 




 Tell that to Heatwave and Captain Cold. 




 Just a disclaimer - I love the show's CGI. I just thought this little bit here was derpy. Loved the finale though. 









 Also, do you guys think that Future Flash knew Eobard was going after Nora after young Barry was taken to safety?

One more thing, in Future Flash's timeline did he grow up with his mother? 




 Same! 




 Whoa what's a Webm and how did that download so quickly in such good quality? 




 Drew it with my index finger so forgive me for the sloppiness. 




 Didn't he say it in the pilot too 




 "Everyone is attractive"

Seriously? You're complaining on how the actors look? The actual acting makes sense but criticism on their appearance is retarded. 




 Especially Captain cold. Everything about his character down to the way he fucking talks. 




 That... Makes a lot of sense. Did you come up with this yourself or is a fact that all that actually happened because of the disconnect?

Common sense I suppose 




 Stop quoting that. That isn't an actual quote from the finale. 




 When he said, "I have to try," I totally did. 




 shooting your dick would just be painful

Implying shooting your balls wouldn't be just as painful if not more?

EDIT: Downvotes for common sense.
 




 Dear Grodd... 




 So, your sister. 




 ty 




 In the finale and at a few points throughout the season since the pilot, we see the Future Scarlet Speedster in all his scarlet red and white emblem glory.  Do you guys think that costume was CGI rendered or does an actual physical Future Flash costume exist on set? 




 Does that mean that an actual Bright Red with White Emblem costume exists on set or was that whole costume CGI? 




 Some would say it's the Reverse. 




 it's on netflix now 




 no its reference to a song 
























 what's the difference between hot sauce and spicy ketchup? 




 I heard white belts are just tossed in with the rest of the crowd and expected to survive at the same pace as everyone else in BJJ schools and that for the first few months - you don't really learn much. Is this true? If so... it really de-motivates me to try and learn BJJ. I learn better through a more organized, progressive curriculum. :/

Can anyone give me some insight? 




 If they were professional, they should have attempted to control this out-of-line cop. 




 Why didn't the other cops try to stop him from having a power trip? 









 Hey guys you just gotta think of how many times this shit happens but it's undocumented so we never hear of it. 




 Small man syndrome. 




 That roll... who the hell does he think he is - 007? 




 Did you mostly train Judo for Sport or self defense? 




 Yeah. For all he know he might've gone to practice twice a year. 




 Stretching helps a lot with soreness especially after practice. 




 They really give out free alcohol at art museums? 




 AHHHHHHHHGHHHGHGHGHHHHHH WHAT THE FUCK OH MY GOD 




 Dang, you got downvoted a lot. 




 I thought Petite meant skinny/thin/slender not short? 




 The best case scenario IS the worse case scenario... in this scenario. The kid wasn't going to die if the bus moved a few inches while his foot was stuck. 




 perfect example of busty petite. 




 That's a really good analogy. So what actual importance do grades serve?  




 Really?? 




 Thank you, friend. Happy Cake Day.

 Very informative and thorough post! I agree with your points. Thanks for your contribution to the thread, friend. Best of luck in your fitness goals. 




 Me (In my head) - "WHAT HAVE I BEEN DOING? WHAT HAVEN'T I BEEN DOING? I EAT MORE GODDAMN PROTEIN EVERY DAY THAN THE AVERAGE BEAR EATS BEFORE IT HIBERNATES. I'VE BEEN HITTING THE WEIGHTS LIKE I JUST STARTED A LIFE SENTENCE IN PRISON AND MY VERY SURVIVAL DEPENDS ON GETTING SWOLE. I AM A FUCKING BEAST.


(What I actually said) - "Oh you know. Diet and exercise. Gotta stay fit. Thanks for noticing."

Fucking real. Stay humble you beast. 




 Would you say Stronglifts 5x5 coupled with carefully tracking your daily calories would be a good strength/mass program? 




 How would you recommend someone looking to make "big" progress doing a cardio-based program that incorporates weights such as P90X? 




 Do you think gradual progress through upping up the weight throughout the course would've made a big difference for these people assuming their diets were just the same as whatever they ate and drank in these 90 days? 




 As in they probably just stuck to using the same weight of dumbbells throughout the whole course?  




 So, basically Cardio while eating at maintenance will not make you leaner? I figured that if you ate at maintenance and did cardio at the same time, the cardio would burn off enough calories for you to be under maintenance at the end of the day and with consistency, you should lose weight and get leaner. 




 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HooRolKCM3s

Before/After results. Is P90X to blame or is it possible they didn't follow through with the program with enough intensity? For some of these people, they actually GAINED weight, Loss Muscle Mass, AND gained bodyfat rather than lose any and make any lbm gains.

EDIT: Also, how can one avoid making no progress in their body while doing P90X?

 Wow, thank you so much for your insight, bro. You're motivating me so much right now - I wanna be able to get to your size! Going to the gym right now to get an early start on the day - thanks for all the tips!  




 Understood, friend. Thanks for the insight. One question though - if I'm starting off with low weight (less than a plate) - would I have to go deeper on my form since the weight will be closer to the ground (for ex: 25s are smaller than a 45 Plate so I would have to go down deeper for it to reach the ground or to pick it up) 




 Understood, friend! And what would you say is a good ending point for a bulk? Obviously, we have to accept that the muscle gained from a bulk comes with a degree of fat, right? So is there a weight goal that I should set before I cut again? I think you might be able to offer some good insight on this since we're both about the same height. 




 Thank you for your advice! I will start focusing on eating less, doing more cardio through Martial Arts training, and starting to be consistent on a strength training program. After I see some good definition going on - I'll start working towards a bulk. 

If I may ask another stupid question - how long do you think I should give myself before I start working towards a bulk? I'm not sure how long this will take so I don't want to try to "waste" any time per se. 




 In Stronglifts 5x5, the Barbell Row form is supposed to be set so your upper body is almost completely parallel with the floor with the bar rowed to your chest. I'm more used to the traditional barbell row with the bar rowed to your stomach with your chest up and back arched like so: http://filledfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/bent-over-barbell-row.png

Would it be okay to sub what I'm used to in place of Stronglifts' Barbell Row? The form just seems dangerous and difficult and I have a hard time rowing it to my chest which makes me rethink whether or not I'm doing it correctly. 




 Also, do you think continuing Strong Lifts 5x5 would be good for me? 




 Understood, thanks for all your advice so far. I really appreciate it.

I'm just afraid, since I'm already pretty skinny, if I go under maintenance - I'm going to look anorexic. Is that a possibility since I don't have much lean muscle mass? 




 What BF % would you say I'm at right now?

And do you think I should keep below a certain number in order to try and keep it as lean as possible while trying to lean bulk? 

My goal is to be a lean 140-145 (basically my current weight but lean) but does that necessarily mean that I would have to bulk up to 165 in order to get the necessary muscle mass to cut down to? 




 I'm currently starting Stronglifts 5x5. I'm kind of frustrated at my body because I wouldn't say I'm "skinny fat" yet I'm skinny and I have no cuts, no definition whatsoever. My stomach is flat without abs and my arms aren't lean. Not quite sure what I should do because I don't want to bulk because I do Martial Arts and I don't want excess weight to hinder my speed and I don't want to get smaller in order to get cut. Hopefully that makes sense. 




 Is it possible for me, as a skinny guy (5'7, 139-140 lbs), to lean out while not losing weight? I want to see definition in my abs and arms but I don't want to get smaller. 




 Will try. :)
 




 Will try. :) 




 Does it have to do with the body mechanics of the kick itself or am I just at a low level of flexibility?

I can hold and launch a Roundhouse very well above my head height but I struggle to do so with the Side Kick.

EDIT: This is my goal: http://legalpronegotiator.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/High-Kick.jpg

Is it obtainable with constant flexibility training or are men naturally limited as opposed to their female counterparts when it comes to the Side Kick due to groin flexibility? 




 Tbh this. 




 Holding target loose to avoid strain on arm = kicking force throwing the arm and "hyperextending it"

Holding target tight to avoid arm being thrown when kick hits target = putting strain on forearm and makes veins pop which equal "pain"

I've never heard of such bs. 




 My friend, who doesn't do martial arts, has been helping me out with my training outside of practice. I just ask him to hold the paddle correctly as I kick it and he complains that it hurts and hyperextends his arm. He also tells me that whenever he holds it while I'm kicking - his veins start showing on his arms and it hurts him.

I can't tell if he's being serious, if I'm somehow inadvertently hitting the target incorrectly to where he's getting injured or if he's just a lousy helper. There's little kids and older adults that hold paddles** for each other and I have **never, ever** heard any of them complain that holding the paddle was hurting their arm. If the kick misfires and hits their actual hand, wrist, or arm then it's understandable. But this... I have never heard of until now.

Edit: Paddles not Padded 




 I was joking

 Oh, I definitely agree with you. Or was this a reply to roninsascha? I just thought it was very ironic that he was criticizing the kicking frequency of a Taekwondo practitioner, let alone a Red Belt. 




 Oh, hey friend. Check this video out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uc-1-Y4Mnro

This is the same song interpreted in dance by an advanced Taekwondo group known as the K-Tigers since if you were interested in that :) 




 Definitely not mocking them, but, in my honest opinion - that form at the beginning can be perfected by absolutely anyone with repetition. It definitely doesn't look like they had enough practice for this demonstration. 




 You didn't catch the White and Green Belts at the beginning of the video? All the kicks and forms are legitimate forms practiced in actual Taekwondo Dojangs but, for the most part - in this scenario, they were executed with bad technique. 




 This is a great answer. 




 Don't listen to that guy. lol

I'm sure you kick way more often than he does. 




 I have the same problem when I practice quick footwork on the mat. I get mat burn on my skin and sometimes it'll peel off and create blisters. When that happens I just wrap my blisters with gauze and tape so I can continue practicing while the blister can heal properly. It'll take awhile but it works for me and it'll work for you too.

As for prevention... I don't quite know the answer to that, tbh. Perhaps wearing in-door TKD shoes? 




 For a guy that's nearly a Black Belt in Taekwondo, I don't think kicking frequency is the problem. lol 




 No protection omg 




 Definitely looked like they didn't rehearsed beforehand at all before performing. :/ 









 Thank you for the explanation. 




 The super speed also comes with the super tardiness. 




 But Superboy is also half-human, not full Kryptonian.  That still applies though? 




 too soon 




 Superboy is a hybrid clone created by Cadmus as well as Red Arrow (non-hybrid though). However Red Arrow seems to age physiologically while Superboy maintains in youthful apperance throughout the timeskip. It's hinted in the series that Superboy will never appear to age.

My question is, why can Red Arrow age yet Superboy can't despite both being Cadmus clones?

 Go to a doctor and get scheduled for a circumcision, immediately. I had pinhole phimosis when I was 11 and I know exactly what you're going through. That ballooning of the foreskin and the pain you get when urinating because the urine flows back in since it can't all escape due to the small opening. That can cause bladder infection over time if not treated.

I had pinhole phimosis for two years and it was hell. The firs time I urinated after I got my circumcision was the best feeling in the world, I was so surprised and happy. Urine flowed out so fast and easy like it normally should as opposed to how it goes out slow and restricted with pinhole phimosis.

No, there is no other treatment for pinhole phimosis that does not result in removal or partial removal of the foreskin. You can ask but your doctor will tell you the same thing. Even minor surgery to open up the opening of the foreskin wider could end up resulting in you developing pinhole phimosis once again so circumcision is the absolute solution for your problem, for our problem.

I know life is hard but you have so much to look up to. Please stay optimistic, I know it's difficult but please, take care of yourself.

Go to a doctor and get checked up for your pinhole phimosis as soon as possible.

Best of luck.

 So it IS derived from the Rasengan. 




 I got downvoted so fast :(

But yeah, I totally get what you mean! It's ironic that you say Wind-Based Version of Chidori since Lightning and Wind are polar opposites lol. I would imagine the "Rasengan-Variant of Chidori" would be similar to the Supreme Ultimate Rasengan (http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Supreme_Ultimate_Rasengan) as it's practically the Rasengan without the intense shape transformation.

Have an upvote. 




  Yo! Champ in the making! guy is Red's father.

That guy always believed in me even when no one else did. Even when I didn't believe in myself. He da real MVP 




 Damn that was so clever. I would give you gold if I wasn't broke. 




 Since Kakashi used the same principles of shape transformation and nature/elemental affinity of the Rasengan to create Chidori, which allowed him to infuse his own nature/elemental affinity to it (Raiton/Lightning Release) - which he couldn't do with the Rasengan.

It's also interesting to note that the Rasengan was created with the intention to be able to infuse all the elemental affinities together simultaneously in one jutsu yet we never saw that happen. 




 Namikaze Satellite omg so much nostalgia 




 hotels and motels can get around it

The latch?

because technically the door can only be opened with a key that only you are given during your stay

But the guys in the story had another key that unlocked her door, right? So that's not always true
 




 dude that's so shady that people would do that. don't you have to get your place checked out or follow regulations and inspections before you can become an official business and run an inn/motel/hotel etc. ?

this sounds like some bates motel shit. with the owner being a serial killer and what not.

 Do you have to bring your own? And do you have to ask for permission to assemble one?

 WHOA. Has Kakashi Hiden been released in manga yet!? 




 In all those times he used the basic Rasengan, he could've infused his elemental nature within it. I don't believe he ever used Fuuton: Rasengan again after clashing with Kakashi's basic Rasengan.

Now I understand Fuuton: Rasenshuriken and True Wind Style: Rasenshuriken (Sage Mode w/Throw and Expand) is more powerful but still. 




 Useless, really? That's a really powerful word. 




 Why doesn't Raikiri have Chidori's distinct sound, "like birds chirping", if they are the same technique?

 I saw a trailer of Ted 2 (that I cannot find on the internet) where Ted  and John are driving with Sam when a huge car accident happens behind them which ends up in (an explosion?) I believe. Sam then goes like "omg are they okay?" then Ted says, "Yeah they're fine, they're waving at us! They're giving us two thumbs up" or something along those lines.

 I'm 18   5'7", I'm still growing but I'm worried that doing gymnastics/tumbling will close my growth plates. The doctor said I could potentially reach 5'8", possibly taller so I want to optimize my growth as much as possible. Is there any scientific evidence or study that supports gymnastics/tumbling does not link to stunted growth? On the surface, it might have some truth as it seems many gymnasts aren't very tall.

I really want to learn how to be more acrobatic and do flips, aerials, roundoff back handsprings, etc. but I'd go against it if it means not growing any taller. 




 Gotta take into consideration that Cung is also a Taekwondo Black Belt. His kicking game is above average.

 Wow I'm really out of the loop. Didn't know there was a Naruto Gaiden. Is it a manga or a spin-off anime series? 




 Very informative answer. Thank you very much. I wanted to buy a snazzy Uniform from my school so I can stop wearing the basic dobok you get at your first lesson. I've bought all my sparring gear from my Dojang but to get the Mooto Extera S5 Uniform (The same one my Master and his children wear along with the advanced students, minus the black trim of course) from them would cost $150 as opposed to buying it online for $99 on Amazon. If it was within a $20- maybe $30 price difference I would go to my Dojang to help support my school. But a $50 difference is out of my budget. I wouldn't imagine it would be an issue but hopefully my master doesn't take it personally.

And yeah! I didn't think wearing a white collar dobok to training as a black belt would be a problem. But definitely keep it formal with the black trim for events such as gradings and competitions, etc. thanks for reconfirming my opinion.

If I may ask, what kind of Dobok do you sport?
 




 Would it be acceptable to continue wearing a White-Collar on occasion as a Black Belt?  




 Kakashi Gaiden...? 




 For all of you that're doubting that Boruto was using Chidori - you're not a true Naruto fan. That sound effect is exclusive to Chidori.

 Eh, Kakashi could do that too around his age.

 It was from Le's last UFC Fight. UFC Fight Night: Cung Le vs Michael Bisping. 




 I love you.  




 Fuck. 




 Good reply. 




 That makes sense, I've heard the same theory regarding white belts fading to black belts. In your dojang, are all colored belts limited to only the White V-neck? And is it considered informal for a Black Belt to wear a White V-Neck?

I don't want to spend a lot of money on quality white-collar uniforms if I can't wear them anymore as a Black Belt. 




 But did it send the opponent flying though? 









 That Hook Kick to set up a Spinning Back Fist was ingenious. The sweep was very smooth as well. I'm gonna miss watching Cung Le's fighting style. Guy loved his spin kicks. 









 Do you think it would be disrespectful for me to save a couple bucks by purchasing a quality Uniform on Amazon rather than through my dojang?

EDIT: A Quality "White-Collar" Uniform. Don't know why I'm getting downvoted. 




 Seems like it varies from dojang to dojang, but is the Black Collar traditionally only for Black Belts?

 It was just something I wanted him to keep in mind. Though good wrestling is a great way to close the distance to neutralize punches and kicks, I don't believe closing the distance/takedowns is/are taught in Judo. But thank you for the sarcasm. 




 Right after that he mentions

 Kicking on the motion, nice. 




 A lot of Judo schools don't teach defense against punches or no-gi, though. They primarily focus on Olympic-Style Judo that primarily focuses on armlocks for submissions.

 Don't act like the stereotype about the correlation between black people and crimes isn't remotely true, though. Let's be real, there's some shitheads in every ethnical group and culture but there's obviously a prominent amount of amongst Blacks than in others in comparison. Largely attributed to their history of growing up in poverty and in the ghetto and what not but that's still not a good excuse to be a shithead.

 ...considering kickboxing is already an aspect of MMA. 









 This guy really lost to fat ass Roy Nelson. What the hell. 




 isnt kickboxing alreadu a part of mma 




 implyying hw fighters are not in shape 




 Even styles that incorporate head punches (EX: ITF TKD) limit themselves in what kind of punches they do and how frequently they practice. Many of those fighters don't ever even learn proper punching mechanics. And by TMA's I mean styles such as variations of Karate and Taekwondo.

In many styles of Karate, the only punch that is practiced against a resisting opponent is the reverse punch which is the only punch that actually scores in Taekwondo.

Punching techniques are ridiculously limited when compared to styles such as Western Boxing, Muay Thai, or American Kickboxing.

Watching /u/LawrenceKenshin's videos of Karate   TKD practitioners enter Kickboxing-esque competition really shows how flawed and porous their punching technique is. 

Obviously, this does not apply to every practitioner but it seems like the majority of them out there have very bad punching. 

tl;dr: Is there a reason that many TMA's put much more emphasis on kicks than punches? 




 I keep hearing "[This style] is the most widely practiced martial art in  the world" with different styles substituting the brackets. So which is truly the most practiced style universally? 




 My favorite is "Martial Arts is a vehicle for developing your human potential." He quoted his old Taekwondo Master when he was promoted to 10th Planet Black Belt. 




 I wonder why he decided to keep it standing rather than follow up on the ground   pound. I guess that's just his way of saying he respects Shamrock's striking. I love how he smoothly turned his back and walked away from it after it swept him.

 You make it sound as if "Olympic Wrestling" is it's own secret special style of wrestling or something. lol. 




 Great display of technique here by Le.  









 Okay, holy shit. So I was about 6 or 7 years old and I was just chilling in my parents' room by myself while everyone was out in the living room watching Spider-Man 2. My parents' room has a door that leads out to the backyard and while watching TV, a FUCKING RAT the size of my 4 year old cousin just scrams through the room and out into the hallway. I immediately follow after it and as it was passing I looked into the other rooms with doors open in the hallway to see if anyone else noticed it. 

It ran out into living room and went straight behind the big TV (the Big TV was right next to the entrance to the living room so it didn't have to travel far). I was freaking surprised that NO ONE NOTICED IT THOUGH. My mom, my aunts, and my cousin were chilling on the couch and no one noticed it.

I had my dad take a quick look behind the TV and we couldn't find anything. 12 years later and I'm still very positive that I saw something... I swear, it wasn't an "overactive imagination" or "I was seeing things" I SAW something. Something black. I'm not sure if it was a rat but it was pretty big.

My dad thought I was crazy and they still remember that too but I knew I saw something. I really wish I spoke up about it when I saw it... maybe I could've gotten another witness.

I still wonder where it went from time to time.

 Oh my gosh, thank you so much for your detailed advice! I will definitely practice these tips on my BoB tomorrow.

 Can it be attributed due to innovations of technology that allow us to accurately diagnosis cases, in which may not have been diagnosed in the past due to limitations on technology or just plain out factors that we still have yet to fully grasp - environmental, genetic defects, etc. ? 




 What I usually do is throw a couple of Roundhouse Kicks to the body have them thinking about that motion. Then, I'd do an Out-To-In Axe Kick which initially follows the same motion as the back leg Roundhouse Kick and then dropping it over my opponent. If it misses the head, it will hit the body. The Axe Kick, in my opinion, is a kick that covers one of the greatest amounts of range amongst all kicks.

I can't tell if Hug is hitting with heel or the ball of the foot, either or - the most important thing, it seems, is after getting the technique down - the timing.

I'm going to be honest and say I spam a lot of Axe Kicks. I'm going to stop using them so excessively in order to heighten my chances of nailing a really good one and dropping my opponent. 

Just throwing an axe kick without any strategy isn't going to end well.

Right on. It seems to work well as a jam/cancel/trap attack so I'll try working my Axe Kicks on the motion. 




 DAN DAN KOKOROHIKARETEKU 




 Wow good eye spotting that Hug utilized the Axe Kick to cancel his opponent mid-attack. Do you ever utilize the Axe Kick in sparring, personally? 



















 NAPPA DIDN'T SAY OVER 9000 YOU FUCKER 




 What the fuck. 




 /s. 




 That would be breaking the fourth wall, dude. 




 Oh I didn't know you could watch it live! Yes! Now I can support my dojang from the comfort of my own room. 




 Forgive me if this is not the proper subreddit for it, but I figured with all the active users - one can enlighten me on whether or not the fighters were at the same weight or if they met catchweight or if there were no weight classes at all in this fight. 




 Never would've thought there are Redditors that rival the perverts on 4Chan. 




 A lot of people, including the coaches at my own dojang, will religiously remind their students to keep their guard/hands up. However, if the top-level guys are having their guard down - is this the most efficient way to spar? Arms hanging at the sides to intercept fast roundhouse kicks from touching the Hogu? 




 Even in the Flyweight division, the shortest Olympic athlete that placed in London 2012 was 5'10'' which is quite tall compared to my size, 5'7''.  Of course, *anything* is be possible - but regarding EBP, E-Hogus, or Daedo -  scoring tends to favor the fighter with the longer reach.  Especially in a fast-paced game that now favors the lead leg cut kick to keep your opponent at bay and to cancel their kick, which works especially well for taller guys.

I do fine against taller opponents via regular chest guard but against taller guys with the E-Hogu - it's very difficult and I'd imagine, at the Olympic level, seemingly impossible.

The same strategy applies for taller, faster fighters I'd imagine - stay outside their kicking range and don't linger on the inside for too long. Angles and feints. Of course, that's easier said than done - especially if the lengthier fighter has a very good guard.

In fact, a strategy that my coach developed against tall fighters with strong guards that involves making them go negative via penalty points in order to win if traditional scoring just is not working at all. (Focusing on knocking them down/off-balance to make them fall while avoiding losing any points, getting them to step out of the ring, etc.)

Basically, it's a definitely harder to go up against a taller opponent, no question about it. But regarding getting into the Olympic-level in a game that favors height and speed, is that even possible?

Sorry if my grammar doesn't make sense, it's late at night and this is something that's been on my mind lately.

 Thank you for the information. 




 What you learn in Combatives is for an untrained opponent, so live sparring against a jiu-jitsu grappler doesn't really factor into the curriculum.

Well, it would make more sense to do that for self-defense than to prepare yourself against 1/10th of the population that actually knows jiu-jitsu. Most of the time it's someone untrained that's trying to punch your face in. 




 Yeah I just watched this video recently. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sgb1Attfm-0

It explains that they hold off on sparring until Blue Belt because it provides a good base for students to spar with when they finally do it. Sparring can be scary and as a white belt you usually end up getting murdered a lot - that can be discouraging and lead to many people giving up and quitting. Holding off on sparring gives them more confidence which leads to more people sticking with GJJ - according to the video. The video also lists their stats on how many people have joined and stayed since they incorporated this new system of instruction regarding the sparring in contrast to how many people have joined and left before the new system. 




 Very good point 




 Can you recommend me a bi/tri program? 




 Started training in Judo recently at my Taekwondo Dojang and the partner I usually pair up with is always falling before I even fully set-up or execute the technique. It makes me question whether what I'm doing is valid or if he's just being too submissive. I'd barely get my hook in on his leg without adding any force for a sweep yet and - there you go, he falls.

I feel like I'm not learning. Also, I should probably point out that my TKD instructor is also a Black Belt in Judo. 




 But that just goes back to the difference in systems right? Gracie Academy is focused on self-defense rather than rolling/free sparring for points. 




 Do the branches created through isolation translate into the trunk? AKA does doing isolation make your compound stronger? 




 What is a good routine/exercises I should follow to build my arms through these "branches"?  




 Do BJJ schools, on average, outside the Gracie Academy focus on what to do in those scenarios? Against an armed assailant, etc. or are they purely focused on what is legal in Sport Jiu-Jitsu? 




 Thank you for your very thorough and informative response. :)

On average, do BJJ schools ever touch-up on the topic of Self-Defense? EX: Neutralizing punches from the guard, escape getting body slammed from an armbar/triangle.

Or do they purely focus on what is legal in Sport BJJ? 




 How can you learn without live sparring? I don't think that's an accurate claim. They likely do have live sparring to prepare for spontaneous self-defense scenarios. 




 You do realize though that students of the Online Academy must be tested in person to earn their Gracie JJ Blue Belt, right? Simply being able to demonstrate the techniques via video may earn you a "Technical" Blue Belt, but an actual Blue Belt must be earned through rolling in the Gracie Academy.
 




 I was referring to how people don't like that Gracie JJ teaches "self-defense" jiu-jitsu rather than "sport" jiu-jitsu. And is there an actual difference between "self-defense" and "sport" jiu-jitsu?

 He does indeed mention "Bunshin," however he STILL makes the damned mistake of pointing it out as a **Ninjutsu**. The Ninjutsu variant of the clone jutsu is the Kage Bunshin or Shadow Clone. Bunshin, regular clone technique, is a **Genjutsu**.

EDIT: Am I really being fucking downvoted for pointing out facts? 




 DUDE, THAT'S EXACTLY THE SCENE I WAS REFERRING TO. 




 Can you try to explain it to me? 




 After Naruto knocked down Neji, he proclaimed that he failed the graduation exam three times because of one jutsu that was always on the exam. His clones were pathetic, he said. He failed the **Shadow** Clone Jutsu/**Kage** Bunshin no Jutsu every time.

Interesting, except solid Shadow Clones/Kage Bunshins are not expected of Academy Students to create in order to promote to Genin.  He learned that technique from a Forbidden Scroll that contained the 2nd's Jutsus along with it's more advanced, forbidden version - the Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu/Tajuu Kage Bunshin no Jutsu.

Even Kakashi was surprised to witness that Naruto could truly use Shadow Clones in their first bell test.

I checked both versions, the Dub and the Sub for consistency and both versions mention that the Kage Bunshin no Jutsu was on the Academy Promotion Exam.

Even when we see Naruto test for his exam in the very first chapter/episode, he was asked to perform the Genjutsu-Variant, Clone Jutsu/Bunshin no Jutsu.

So what gives? This has always irked me since I first saw the episode.
 




 *grabs your penis* 




  Not speaking from experience, but for martial arts wouldn't you want to focus on speed and power, not size and strength. 

Definitely. But, I'm on "off-season" for competition and this is my first year going up in the Senior Division (18+). A lot of guys cut down to my weight class at 135 or 128 from two, maybe even higher weight classes so they have a sizable strength advantage over me.

I've always been a relatively small guy so I wanted to use this time to focus on building strength and mass and then cutting later once I get to competing again.

Are 5 day splits generally used for building muscle?

 




 Three months. I kind of want to switch to doing a designated muscle group per day and only squatting once a week per leg day. 




 Do you think I should just stick to 5x5 for strength/mass training and deal with the soreness?

EDIT: I just want to do legs once per week.

 How'd you know what the real link was? 




 A gay Mr. Terrific. Interesting. 




 I know Starling City is supposed to represent Star City, Green Arrow's city much like Gotham is to Batman or Bludhaven is to Nightwing, but did that Intro by Stephen Amell/Oliver Queen at SDCC hint at Starling City's renaming to Star City? 




 Happy Cake Day. 




 Wow, that was really obvious. Thank you very much for pointing it out for me, I would've never gotten it. I was trying to look for something deeper lol 




 I really don't understand the joke. Seriously. Can someone please explain? 




 What the hell? Those aren't the lyrics to Gotta Go Fast

 Does TARS stand for "The Armored Robot Suit" ?? 




 What does TARS stand for? 




 The Armored Robot Suit? 




 *The Red Capes are coming~* 




 What does TARS stand for!??? 




 And then he pulls out the Kryptonite. 




 Dark Knight trilogy was pretty good, didn't you think? 




 I hope so. The fact that Batman would wear a military uniform over his batsuit is pretty ridiculous but then again wearing a batsuit is ridiculous in of itself. 




 What the fuck is he wearing. 




 Holy fuck, that's beautiful. 




 You can say that, but Silva is definitely drilling some Wing Chun techniques here. 




 Her tits seem way smaller too 




 Ah, the lead leg cut kick/side kick. Yeah, tall fighters love that technique because it optimizes their long range. I hate it too and it's difficult to get past, I usually try to angle out.


Edit: I thought you were referring to blocking kicks with the shin. 




 Ah, I see. That's happened to me a few times as well when there was no one my equal weight at my current belt level.

Thank you for the tips and videos, but what do you mean my leg check? Checking kicks is illegal in WTF Taekwondo, isn't it? 




 No worries, thanks bro! 




 Why were you up against such heavier fighters at 155 lbs? That's extremely unfair and defeats the purpose of having weight categories.

Despite that I'm so glad you managed to came victorious and unharmed. That inspires me to work hard and keep a strong fighting spirit.

What's your strategy against taller, heavier fighters? 




 I agree, I like your shot. 




 Thanks for letting me know, upvoted. Sorry about that.

EDIT: Do you happen to have the link to the original post? I want to read the comments. 




 I think your best option now is to remain blue belt as long as you possibly can before it becomes obvious that you should move up a belt

I will take that advice. Thank you very much. I'm also a pretty light fighter, constantly drifting from 135-145ish not really staying consistent because local tournaments don't weight color belts, they just size them up based on looks. I will go to Qualifiers next year at 128 lbs and, eventually, as a Black Belt I will compete at Fin, lowest, at 120 lbs.

You're worrying that you will not be leaving behind a legacy like theirs but you only have good thinks to look forward to, you're young and have lots of potential.

Thank you very much for your reassurance. For awhile I haven't felt young anymore because I'm not a Junior yet at the same time I'm not old enough 30+ to where I'm just doing this for recreation like the older crowd and parents in the adult classes.  But you're right, I'm still young and I can only grow from here. My goal is to win a National Championship under my belt.  Even if I'll only ever win as a color belt, I would be proud of myself if I can claim the Gold next year.  Looking forward to all the progress ahead of me! 

If I may ask, were you nervous at all to compete as a Black Belt for the first time? Or had it just felt like any other competition.

 crosspost from /r/martialarts. The community there is more active so I posted there initially but this is where this post really fits:

Hey, /r/taekwondo... I'm in an awkward position. As a Blue Belt in Taekwondo with close to two years of training under my belt, I figure I'm doing alright at my level. I've done well at each local tournament sanctioned by the USAT since switching over to a USAT Taekwondo Dojang. 

A year ago I never would've thought I would be able to do the things I'm doing now. I just wanted to do Taekwondo for recreation since I always loved watching Martial Arts films featuring Jackie Chan or Bruce Lee with those athletic kicks they displayed on-screen. The initial dojang I started with was part of a chain of several dojangs and, unfortunately, the particular dojang I trained at was not very good - at least for me. [It was such a bad fit for me that at one point I considered quitting Taekwondo altogether.](https://www.reddit.com/r/martialarts/comments/2hb00k/should_i_drop_taekwondo_for_muay_thai/)

Thankfully, I listened to your guys' advice and found a great dojang that I transferred to. I have a good relationship with my coach/master, I consider him an uncle, as well as many of the students that I train with. Amazingly, since I started training over here, my skills have improved tremendously since I started. So much so that watching old videos of me sparring from when I was still training over at my previous dojang makes me cringe.

The dojang I currently train under has produced very many successful Taekwondo competitors. Several National Champions, USA National Team Members, and countless other achievements have been born from here. A year ago I never would've thought that I would be able to potentially compete at such a high level but now, knowing so, it makes me afraid to try.

This year following the National USA Taekwondo Tournament in Austin, Texas we have 4 students from our Dojang that qualified to make the National Team, 2 of which will be competing in the Cadet World Championships in Korea.

I'm amazed at how good everyone around me is... however, that's also what makes me somewhat disappointed...

I'm 18 years old. A lot of these guys have been training since they were little kids and have kept training for over 6-10+ years. Everyone that has done exceptionally well, like capture a Title [ex: National Champion], have done so under 18.  If you don't quite follow what I'm saying yet, you will.

I've met a lot of great martial artists, Black Belts, here since I started. We had a bunch of them that were 18+, or turning 17-18 [AKA making the Senior Division - sparring in the 18-32 age group] that were doing really well but eventually stopped competing competitively, or quit altogether.  Unfortunately some of them were also kicked out of the dojang for coming in and teaching classes under the influence.

The circle of high-level Black Belts in the Senior Division is not very big. Therefore, all the big names are well-known. As a kid you have plenty of opportunities to compete, but the problem for me... as an Adult is that the guys in the Black Belt Senior Division have kept training since they were a kid and are *exceptionally* outstanding.

So much so that people stop competing once they reach Senior age because they're afraid or they see that they've reached the end of their journey as a competitor and they cannot go any further.

I'm afraid this is what will happen to me when I reach Black Belt next year. 

Last night I went out with a couple of my friends, Black Belts from the dojang, and they talked about all the great competitors that used to train here.  Though I didn't know any of them, personally, I do know they were really successful during their career.  Unfortunately, I felt really left out since I couldn't relate to any of what they were saying or what they've accomplished. 

When I leave for University in a year or so, will I be remembered at all?  For anything...

I started Taekwondo when I was 17 and I'm turning 19 soon... so I never had the opportunity to spar at a less-extreme level of competition. Even now, it's not that intense because I'm still a color belt but like I said earlier, the circle of Black Belt Senior competitors isn't especially huge compared to Junior Black Belts or even Senior/Junior Color Belts. (There are guys that could very well qualify for the Olympics in this division, even at just the National Level Competitions)

I regret not starting Martial Arts earlier when I was a kid. I wish I had more opportunities to grow, earn more tournament experience, and make mistakes before I had to compete in the Senior Division.

For now, I'm okay... as I'm still a Color Belt but the fact that my coach and my friends around me push me to promote to the next level worries me.  I don't feel like I deserve to move up to Red Belt, which is right underneath Black.  That would put a lot of pressure on me to have a high-level of skill - which I do not possess as of yet...
I like where I'm at because I think it suits me.  I'm not a beginner and I'm not really experienced enough to be advanced. Blue Belt... right in the middle - Intermediate.  I think that describes me well.

A year ago I was always excited for the next belt promotion but now that I'm doing Taekwondo not just for recreation but for competition, the next promotion just worries me.  I don't think I'm good enough. I don't think I deserve what's ahead of me... at the same time, I can't just stay here forever.  What is life without progress?

In the Senior Black Belt Division, all Black Belts are put up against one another in each weight class regardless of the level of their experience as a Black Belt.  You can have someone who just got their 1st Degree and has been training for 3 years go up against someone that's been a Black Belt for 3 years and has been training for over 10 years consecutively altogether... 

That's worries me the most... especially seeing how one of the coaches, who personally coached me for a National Qualifier Tournament last year, from another chain dojang that was tied to my previous dojang is now a USA National Champion in the Senior Division.  Knowing that in a year or so that I could potentially be put up against him since we could be in the same weight division scares me.

I'm stuck. I keep choking... seeing how all my friends that have done so well eventually dropped out after they've reached Senior Division age or after just a few competitions in that Division.

Once I reach Black Belt, will my career as a competitor also be over?

 They're moving in herds. They do move in herds. 




 Don't be mean. 




 Bro, no spoiler tag!?????????? 




 Well... for reference Cisco even pointed out the **brighter red** on the Future Flash costume along with the white emblem in the newspaper from Well's secret room. I can pull a quote from the episode if you would like.

And EDIT: I did screen that myself. 




 too soon? no chill. 




 photoshop 




 With proper lighting it looks substantially brighter. I screened a part where the light reflected on his costume. Anything can look dark in bad lighting. http://i.imgur.com/ZuN32CM.png 




 Dude, I was referring to Future Barry in comparison to the main Barry. It's obvious the suit has remained the same shade of red, however there's no dying how bright red Future Barry's suit was in the finale compared to main Barry. Don't downvote me for that. 




 What was your weight when you first started 




 Down to that sharp nose. 




 very nice. 




 Not as bright as Future Barry though 




 The costume's a totally brighter red though.  




 Future Barry's suit was too bright red to look like this 




 THE WHITE EMBLEM!????? 




 Great video loved that ending part, thought it was just going to be a typical hype trailer till that glitchy ending. Got me hooked. 




 Well, she's known this guy from back in Hawaii. I'm her only friend other than the people who train at the gym in this city as of now so I'm not worried about out-of-state competition. But if she won't even talk to the guy closest to her, in the literal sense, then yeah it's a lost cause. She's a cool girl, at the very least I want to keep her around even if it means putting her off. Thanks for the comment. 

I had a strong feeling we were gonna get together or hook up the first night but I didn't want to go too forward because it seemed way too soon so, maybe I missed my opportunity or maybe I did the right thing. Only time will tell I guess. 




 Thanks a lot man. Your post made me feel better. Haha. Been kind of down on myself by over reading the situation. Was afraid I already fucked everything up. So, just go on about, chatting and making small talk as usual and ask her out for lunch or something later this week would be okay?
 




 Yeah I agree. Should've stopped sooner. But, I don't know. I just wanted to send her a nice text. Wasn't trying to be clingy or forward, just wanted to let her know I think she's cool and I like her. Girls like a sweet text every now and then.

I guess I fucked up though.  




 Thanks again man. That's perfect. Just gotta see how she reacts today and that'll give me my answer right there... 

just say "I have a lot on your mind" and sorry reply, sound a little sarcastic

Not really sure what you meant here? "I have a lot on *your*(not my) mind. Sorry"  




 I sure hope as hell that you weren't driving pointlessly just so you could talk to a girl. 4 hours of wasting gas and time? Daamn bro. Talking aint everything, should have flirted with her and set up a date and then escalate,

Gotta lay down that groundwork brah. She said she's down to kick with me when there's a party or alcohol.  




 Would she be down for that if she didn't respond...? Kind of afraid not responding means she totally is not into me anymore even at the slightest.  




 Okay, good points man. 

That tension you felt when the moment seemed right to kiss her but you talked yourself out of it? Don't let that happen again.

Agreed. 


Stop with being her taxi and BFF or at least give her the silent trip for the ride and if you do give her a ride try to kiss her. 

At this point, I'm not quite sure what I can say or do to lead up to this kiss. I kind of feel like I fucked up last night, I know it was just a txt convo but still. If it's just a silent ride... I don't want her to feel awkward or anything but yeah that'll give her the message.

I can't do both though. What do you think I should do? Obviously, I can't give her a silent trip *and* try to kiss her. And I can't just do it out the blue without any prior convo/lead up. 

Eh, my bad if I'm being difficult.

I just feel like there's still potential here and I want to salvage every last bit of it. 

Really appreciate the advice.
 




 Yeah, I suppose you're right. Still bothers me on why she decided to be so blunt, but what can I do? 

I guess you could do it at the end of the drive before you leave the car. Just say something like "lets finish this conversation on Friday night, I'd like to take you out for drinks".

Not drinking age yet haha but I'll ask her if she wants to grab a bite to eat this Saturday since I'm off work. Hopefully she's off work too but, even so, if she's into me she'll try to make time. Thanks, man. I'll ask her out when I drop her off. 

Assuming she doesn't think I'm a totally fucking dunce and get a ride from someone else tonight lol. 




 Okay, yeah. You're right. What should I ask then when I see her again? I mean, I really don't know if there are any parties coming up. Asking her if she wants to see a movie might be too cheesy and easily flawed. Can't think of anything to do and we've pretty much been hanging out already in the car.

I want to make a remark at her about that dead-convo last night though just to see if I can pry something out of her. Should I be like, "By the way, you suck at texting for someone who loves talking, haha" or something? I want to know what's/what was on her mind. 




 you should of made one of the going home rides into a mini date maybe like lets stop for a drink, food something. 

I did, but she said she doesn't eat past 7 because of cutting weight. Went through a drive-thru to get us some drinks though. At several points I did want to kiss her and I felt like it would've been perfect but I didn't want it to be so soon since I've literally started talking to her for like two days.

Didn't feel like I was overtexting her, but the conversation definitely ended short.

I'm seeing her again tonight when I pick up her up for class, should I mention/bring up that text convo from last night? Also, how would you suggest I "fix" this? 




 Yeah, but I've only talked to her for two days. She seems really cool. Worth putting in some more effort. 

Should I bring up/ask her if everything was okay last night after I dropped her off when I see her again today? 




 I mean had to provide some context to really emphasize/show how it was so sudden. I'm picking her up again today, should I bring up that texting convo from last night?

EDIT: Added a tl;dr. 




 Thanks for the clarification 




 Piccolo is also a Tower. 




 Thank you very much! 




 Thanks for clarifying for him /u/CallMeBanjo. Guess I could've put "TIL  that at 5'11'', Post-Timeskip Naruto is taller than 5'9'' Goku" for the people who can't read. 









 So far three of my teammates made National Team! Hooray! Congrats on qualifying. Better save up now so you can be National Champion next year :) 




 Understood, thank you! Hayk, I'm a long-time fan of your videos. Have you ever considered trying out for the Olympics? I honestly believe you would do very well if you chose to go that route. 




 So... real? 




 Wait. Naruto and Hinata have the sex??? 




 Beautiful display of technique and agility. Been a long-time fan of your videos, keep up the great work!! /r/martialarts is a fan of your work too. I posted one of your videos there and it got a lot of positive responses https://www.reddit.com/r/martialarts/comments/31joyw/taekwondo_v_kickboxing_good_example_of_how/ 




 DUDE. I've seen your Kickboxing videos, you inspire me SOOOO much. Thank you for posting those videos. You inspire me. 

Can you give me any advice for fighting stronger, taller opponents? 




 Apparently handseals are bullshit. 




 Like Dare-Devil. 




 What does TnJ do? 




 Ryan Higa

That's two remakes.

 Why THE FUCK does it need my Street Address?

 The Cross Fingers isn't a traditional seal. Apparently it is it's own unique seal. 




 Rewritten, ALREADY? Jesus. This is almost as bad as having two Spider-Man remakes within the last 15 years. 




 The Red Hair and skinny body is fucking stupid for a transformation into a God. I'm sick of this Blue/Red Hair fairytale-lookin bullshit. I just want to stick with the hardcore Super Saiyan Golden hair.

 Ain't nothing but a heartache. 




 I saw the trailer, I haven't seen it. Not quite sure if it's even gotten a US release yet but, to be quite honest, I'm not into "back in the age" martial arts films with swords and etc.

When I think of Jackie Chan, I think of modern martial arts action-comedy movies. [For example, this scene from "Who Am I" is one of my favorites.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJ5oaBWYzPk)

I've also noticed a lot of American movies getting better and better with their martial arts choreography. [Most notable one for me was this scene from Captain America: The Winter Soldier.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHh0XaW0UyQ)

[Have you seen Every Frame a Painting's video about Jackie Chan's action-comedic style?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1PCtIaM_GQ) Great video. 




 That said, I enjoyed the Chris Pratt mixtape thing.

Honestly, the only redeeming factor of the movie for me. 




  The problem is though the dogs tended to get scared and run back to their masters...with the bomb.

 Step Brothers.

I don't think it's *that* funny yet people in my city quote it like it's the comedy movie of the century.

 Fuck, I just made a big comment describing this scene before I found that you already replied with the link. 




 Reminds of the scene in Enter the Dragon where a bully Martial Artist challenges Bruce Lee on the ship. He questions Lee's style of fighting to which Lee claims his style is, "The Art of Fighting Without Fighting." The Bully challenges Lee and boasts that he can defeat his style to which Lee says that they need more room. Lee points to an island and  suggests they take one of the smaller boats from the ship to ride out there. As the bully climbs down to the boat, Lee releases the line and the bully is trapped in the boat off the ship where he can no longer bully the people on the ship.

The Art of Fighting Without Fighting. 




 You're fucked. Have an upvote.

 What exactly is an "indie game" btw? 




 Thank you, friend. I will check it out. 




 Oh shit. 









 Hi-Five! did the same thing here ;) 




 That's extremely inconvenient. I'm sorry to hear that but I hope you enjoy your game. 




 B-But Charmander gets Metal Claw. 




 Why the hell did you delete your account? 




 that fucking yawn. 




 YES! So that is why you must price match from Target at Walmart. But I agree, that policy is bullshit. 




 Do you remember what time in the video? 




 Unfortunately the register girl was a dumbass when I went and told me they don't price match against their own prices so I brought up Target's prices for ORAS. Still $29.99 but the fact that I had to do that and the fact that Walmart has two different price tags for the same item is bullshit. The girl probably didn't know the correct policy on that too because the guy working the electronics section told me it was fine if I price matched from their website so long as it was the same item. 

Wanted to post this comment as soon as you posted yours but Reddit's comment delay timer bullshit mechanic prevented me from doing so. 




 The only reason I can think of is because Wi-Fi distribution events are inconvenient for them. They hardly ever do Wi-Fi events. We live in a generation where you can distribute an event to anyone with Wi-Fi access and they still make us go pick something up "in-store." 




 Fantastic!!!

Oh, no. I asked my dad and apparently the Macbook Pro w/Retina doesn't have a LAN port because it is Wi-Fi only :( 

So I guess that means I would have to buy an adaptor of some sort?  




 Thank you, friend. 




 so op lied 




 wtf cant tell if srs 




 No, if you go to Walmart and buy it - it costs $39.99... 




 Did "./relaymyhome full" from there and got this http://i.imgur.com/p2h7oP4.png

I'm assuming everything went well and all I need to do is to connect my Macbook Pro w/Retina Display to a LAN Cable which is also connected to my Router while my N3DS is in sleep-mode and I will receive Eon Ticket via Street Pass? :D

 Why the hell are you training with fellow students, and allowing other students to train each other when they have not received permission from the master to either teach, or lead a class?

It's not a crime to practice with other students outside of class.

 Here are screenshots of both the "ls" in termianl  and the network name. The security is also set to none, last time I checked. How can i confirm though?

Thank you very much for all your help!! If you could just guide me through the program mechanics so I can do this correctly via Terminal, by tomorrow morning I can ask my dad for the LAN Cable so I can maybe make this work :) 




 What's the difference beteween the basic Taekwondo Roundhouse Kick and a "Kickboxing" Roundhouse Kick? 


Very little if any. The misconception here is that Taekwondo, Karate, Muay Thai, Kickboxing, etc. etc. all are completely different which is not necessarily true. Yes, their are slight differences in mechanics due to each sport having their own ruleset. 

WTF Sport Taekwondo, for example, scores kicks via contact with the Instep of the Foot. Taekwondo kicks also, mostly, all start from the chamber position and end chambering back whereas Muay Thai Roundhouse kicks, for example, swing and hit with the ~~instep~~ shin being a "full-contact" sport that doesn't have a focus on points.

However, the proper, basic mechanic of the kick - turning your hips, hand positioning, etc. for all styles should all be very similar. We have several guys that crosstrain in Muay Thai and Kickboxing at my Taekwondo Dojang and one of my Masters used to compete in Thai Boxing competitions back in Asia so I'm speaking from my own personal experience - not just theories pulled out of my butt.

Semantics aside, the basics are the same. If this guy can't perform a proper "TKD form kick," I would definitely question his credibility as a decent "kickboxer." 

EDIT: Just my two cents.

EDIT: For the sake of my example above, I was referring to the basic Roundhouse Kick.

EDIT: Meant shin not instep. corrected it 




 Why's that? 




 Keep us updated on your situation, OP. Hope things turn out for the better. 




 OH, I haven't been connecting my Mac with my router via LAN Cable. Not sure how to do that or what a LAN Cable is or if I even have one.

But I'm assuming I should use USB Ethernet then? That sounds correct, right?

Anyways, I went along with the rest of the steps and there's no directory found:

EDIT: As you can see I clicked on USB Ethernet and selected Wi-Fi 




 You know that Jun Fan is just Bruce Lee's Chinese name, right? Li Xiaolong was his nickname/stagename but "Jun Fan" is not a style - it's his Chinese Name. Bruce, not having fully learned the Wing Chun system at the time when he moved to the US, opened up a school and dubbed it "Jun Fan Gung Fu" where he taught the Wing Chun concepts he did know along with his own mix of styles he practiced outside of Wing Chun. 




 added 2 edits to my latest reply. 




 1. Internet Sharing - http://i.imgur.com/k2VxSdM.png
[I selected both Ethernets to be safe]

2. Have Relaymyhome folder in Documents and access it through Terminal with the commands they tell you in the instructions in order. 
http://i.imgur.com/7GRfWdt.png

3. Nothing works.

4. Try just accessing the folder by clicking and activating homepass manually. http://i.imgur.com/jUzqeO5.png

5. Nothing is working still. But it looks like it's running.

EDIT: So, what did I do wrong?

EDIT2: Using the alternative method by accessing it without terminal makes it run without anything working. I'll get through several cycles with nothing. No streetpasses whatsoever. And my Street pass for Buzz Nav is definitely on for Omega Ruby. 




 Okay, you know what I'm going to do? I will screenshot and send you every step I'm doing so you can tell me what I'm doing wrong. 




 It's okay. I've tried both. Like I said, maybe it's just me. I'm running OS X Yosemite 10.10.1 on a Macbook Pro w/Retina Display.

Maybe the problem is I'm not using terminal at all to navigate. I just go straight to relaymyhome folder and click on the program and activate it from there and it runs like this (you can see me go straight to the folder and clicking on it in the background) http://i.imgur.com/jUzqeO5.png

Theoretically it should work the same but nothing's working and I've tried for a few hours. So I'm giving up. Thank you. 














 Never heard of that before. Was it popular at one point? 




 I got two Japanese Hoopas yesterday legit with Ribbons. 




 So, basically nothing special. 




 Thank you very much for your help so far, by the way. 




 No problem. You realize you can screenshot through your Mac, right? Cmd + Shift + 4.

Anyways, I have two Ethernet options, I'm not sure which one to use that is my problem http://i.imgur.com/DrCLCzB.png

See? There's Display Ethernet and USB Ethernet, no just "Ethernet" option. 




 It's doing this. I went straight to the folder and clicked on and activated homepass without using Terminal. http://i.imgur.com/kXoZ3Gr.png


No streetpasses have been detected. Do I need a USB Ethernet or whatever the hell that is? I'm using a Macbook Pro.

 




 After I use ./relaymyhome full it just says

./relaymyhome full
-bash: ./relaymyhome: is a directory


it doesn't run. and when i try to just use the relaymyhome exec from the folder, it just keeps running and running without anything happening. could you please give me specific step to step on how you did this? I'm following the step to step there but they leave things out and it's bothering me because I'm not doing it correctly. I don't know how to use terminal.  




 I've tried using that tutorial too. But there's Two Ethernet Options and so far it hasn't been working for me. Idk if I'm doing it properly. Which Ethernet Option should I use? USB Ethernet or Display Ethernet?? 




 Stuck on Step 4. http://i.imgur.com/3lLXSMK.png

No "Wi-Fi Options button." And I'm assuming you meant select Internet Sharing from the "Pull-Down Menu" in Sharing from System Preferences. 




 The Wi-Fi Options button in the Sharing Menu doesn't pop up for the "Wi-Fi" "share your source from" option. 




 Also where is the Wi-Fi Options button from the Sharing Menu? 




 Thank you for your comment. Where can I download this MBA? And how do I find MAC addresses of Spotpass locations? 




 If I trade my 3DS original in for a N3DSXL via the Gamestop Promotion, will I lose my Ambassador Program games?

EDIT: Is there anyway for me to save my Ambassador games??

 I want to get the Eon Ticket for Omega Ruby. :(

Please help. I've been following this guide but I think it's outdated and doesn't work https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/2nk7f1/scriptosx_easiest_method_to_get_eon_ticket/ 




 Can you still use Homepass to get the Eon Ticket if you recently updated your 3DS? And if so, how? 

EDIT: For Mac please. 




 Are you trolling or is it really? 




 DUDE. Those are really small Gorillas. 




 Is this real? 




 Wow those are magnificent.  




 Yes!! 




 Wait, why did I get downvoted? I just liked his comment. 




 Mew Glitch in RBY. 




 Japan. 




  Like if you come to a full stop at every stop sign in Chicago you will get rear ended eventually. 

HOLY FUCK. I always make a full stop. I've been doing so since I failed my driver's test for making a rolling stop. 

never going to chicago. 




 You must be fun at parties. 




 WHY IS IT ALWAYS JAPANESE GIRLS 




 Yes! 




 Thoughts on Deism? 




 Is it just me or did it seem Reddit was really boring at first. Like the interface, the front page, the layout seemed sooo... y'know. 




 I'm sorry, I'll remove it. 




 Yup in Book 1 he said he'd never firebend again and on the cover of book 3 - he's firebending. 









 TAKE-HOME LAPTOPS THAT CAN GO ON REDDIT. That's a nice school you go to. And yeah, I get you on the time wasted part! Reddit is the bane of college students. 




 Bruh, this black guy literally brought a fucking radio and played that shit loud as hell without earphones/headphones in the gym. I've never seen someone so dgaf before in my life. 




 That's fucking crazy. I'm never eating breakfast again... oh wait, I don't already. 




 Lol, dude. That's what happened to me too. 




 I mean, there's a dubbed version of the first movie in Blu-Ray I believe. 




 Woah those are some really small tits. Nice though. 




 Did her tits get bigger? 




 Dude, thanks! Fapfapfapfapfap 














 So is it fake? 




 I'm just trying to find the most vague description ever that could be any film on this thread. 




 Wait, I forgot. What happened in Supercop? Unless you were referring to the old man with the fake boobs...

I know he grabbed a girls' tits while fighting her in one movie. Wasn't Supercop though.

EDIT: Not talking about Rush Hour either. He was fighting a group of tall black girls. 




 "Hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard." 




 This guy carried a 3.9 GPA in University and graduated with the highest honors. Quoted as a great group leader and had mature academic work. What the hell happened... he seemed like he had a bright future. 




 Like Dragon Ball GT. 




 I was thinking about watching that. Is it not good?

I remember the Pre-Time Skip filler arc with Naruto and Sasuke like episode "The Worst Three-Legged Race" was really entertaining and funny. 




 I came. 




 Source!? 




 Will definitely do. I will tell me instructor, straight-up, that I will refuse to have a match with this student again until he purchases arm guards along with shin   instep guards. I'm tired of clashing elbows and shins with this guy. He's a grown man too. 




 Will definitely do. Thanks for the tip.

It's frustrating how something so small can leave a big impact on your body.  Feels like I still need to take a few days off practice. 




 Roundhouse Kicks. One of my sparring partners doesn't wear arm guards and keeps his guard down to his sides. Sometimes I get unlucky and catch and elbow since the Roundhouse Kick hits the sides of his body. I ended up limping on my left foot so I couldn't move properly and just did checking motions until he came in and I caught him with a Spinning Hook Kick with my right foot. 




 The guy I was sparring wasn't using arm guards. And I can't imagine that you'll ever get used to the pain of having a roundhouse kick connect with the instep right on your opponent's elbow. Every time that's happened to me - it puts me out for a few days to a week due to the bruising.  I iced it last night and took ibuprofen but I can hardly walk still.  Hurts to put weight on it. 




 I do wear instep guards. The Adidas Shin + Instep pads. Still hurts like hell when you roundhouse kick someone's flank when they have arm down and you hit their elbow. 




 What's your opinion on moontasri's performance and his future in the Ufc 




 So can you just replace the ink and sticker paper to constantly be able to use the Snap Kiosk or will it just be out of commision once the ink and the paper and what not run out? 




 Shisui's Mangekyou Sharingan's unique jutsu to alter someone's mind. 




 I still remember the blowjob ending.

 I've read that hentai too. 




 Except maybe a new Boruto series. 




 Did anyone else notice a change in art style? 




 Great coloring! But no blood? 




 Did we ever get a follow-up on what happened to Victoria after the whole Ellen Pao incident? 

Did she ever make any public statements, answer any questions? Is she working somewhere else now, is she okay?

 




 Tom Holland is 5'6. Same height as the Peter Parker incarnation from the "Spectacular Spider-Man" TV Series. 




 Me too!! 




 By all estimates I've seen, Pokemon XD did worse, critically and financially, than XD.

Wait what? Pokemon XD did worse than XD?


But yeah, I guess I agree with what you're saying. To maximize profit, they should just pour their efforts into what they know will sell and if it means shutting down production of more home console RPGs, so be it.  It's nice that they do take the successful story elements from them to add to the main handheld games, though. 









 costume over a costume. 




 I never took Carrie as a serious Robin/character, to be honest. Her character design along with those big goggles/glasses looks like Velma from Scooby Doo in Robin cosplay. 




 what's wrong with boobs
