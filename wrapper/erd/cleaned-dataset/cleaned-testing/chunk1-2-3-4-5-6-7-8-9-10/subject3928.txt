 Rowayton! But I live in LA now.  




 Ghost Beach
The Headless Ghost

And a few short stories. Something  about a lunchbox...  




 just seeing this, months later. I'm from Norwalk! 




 chaplin?  




 I'm about to crush some childhoods, but R.L. Stein had a large army of ghostwriters doing about 80% of his work. My mom was one of them. She wrote two books and a few short stories. He's cool and all, but it's the franchise that's even cooler.  




 Brenden, I'm a soccer comic.  




 oh man, this is my favorite joke and i use it all the time 




 as a long time redditor, and a long time friend of George's, I can only assure you that this mofo is only warming up.  




 hurray for wilton, ct! 




 bro so sick bro 




 I'm also from CT, and have totally been there. Awesome.  




 but seriously, what was this show called?  




 you rule.  
























 there's nothing more fun than looking back at the things you made in elementary school. if you're a parent, please save all your kids stuff.  




 this is my favorite thing i've seen all week. granted, it IS Monday, but i stand by what i said.  




 yes, i totally owned that.  




 what was this from? 




 I'm still mad at my brother for throwing mine down the stairs and breaking it. I told him this recently.  




 Great work! 




 you should be a tattoo artist!  




 I have the same TV. just thought you should know.  




 i love this. a lot.  




 I just let out a big ol' "awww" at work.  




 because he invented anti-cancer.  




 this made me laugh a lot, despite the fact that 32 people were most likely killed right after.  




 she actually did a few of those as well. and the Treehouse Times. a lot of those huge mega corp books hire out other people! bastards! 
























 I took this image from reddit a few months back. I'd really love to know who drew it!  




 "Sometimes you have to peel your own banana." 

It's from a kid's book of African short stories my mom used to read to my brother and I. Since then, it's become sort of a family montra.  









 "I murdered and ate my last girlfriend and everyone found out so I'm waiting until it all blows over until I strike again." 




 another deep fryer 




 tumblr. 




 the smell! 




 WHEEEEERE? 




 i concur. perhaps 'nerdy dad goose.' 




 I'm really bad a beat boxing, but when no one's around, I beat box my face off.  




 I do the same thing but with great Roman warriors 




 what about reading about playing, written by 4 year old bumblefuck? that sounds hilarious.  




 SURF REDDIT ALL DAY MOFOS 
























 Go get checked. I just had a cancer scare and it was no fun.  




 I will be seeing you at the Hollywood Bowl on October 8th. Can we hang out?  




 i was sooo close to photoshopping this same exact thing. you win!  




 yeah! 




 ahhh you got me! 




 I was just in line at the bank. The guy in front of me was some creepy old guy wearing a AAA uniform. The girl behind me was an attractive Latina nurse. 

So the old guy starts hitting on the nurse pretty hard. Calls her spicy, compliments her figure and generally eye-fucks her the whole time. I could tell that she was getting really uncomfortable, and felt like I should intervene. I mean, I was sandwiched between them so it's not like I could ignore it all. So, I did what I do best: I start hitting on the old pervert. Hardcore. 

I generally repeated the things he said to her, complimented his mustache and uniform and said it would look best on my bedroom floor. I even winked a few times. I could tell this guy was incredibly homophobic and hated the fact that he was getting hit on by a guy. He did, however, understand the point I was making and got out of line and left. He even apologized. 

The girl thanked me and said she'd never seen anyone do that. I just replied that I'm always happy to fight fire with fire. 

So is this something I can get knighted for? I'd love to be knighted.  




 they do in my heart 




 great, now i'm turned on at work 




 More times than you'd think. I should also add that I owned a toy from the smash hit FLUBBER that would dance from sound activation. If I started clapping, shit would go crazy.  




 From ages 8-10 (roughly). It was great.  




 clearly i should stay off the internet. thanks!  




 got em!

sorry, there's the link.  
























 Happy Holidays!!! 




 where's the star at the end, bro? 




 Hm, good point. I figured liquor was an easy fix, but it's probably the best option. Thanks for the tip!  




 I like it.  




 I've been working as an assistant for the past year and a half and my boss and I get along great. He's gotten me really cool and thoughtful gifts for both Christmas and my birthday, but for the life of me, I can't think of a good Christmas gift for him. 

Any ideas of what I can get a family-man around 45 who loves toys and TV shows? 

 




 what a card! 









 yes.  




 I'll pay you $30 to eat it.  




 coooooool 




 lol!  




 best. 




 i sympathize  
























 this is brilliant
 




 Isn't that where Matilda and Ms. Honey lived after defeating the Trunchbull?  




 i can beat this game on normal in 17 minutes flat. eat it.  




 I've been paleo for about 6 months now. I work out regularly (3-5 times a week, including lifting) and am interested in using more supplements. I typically have a scoop of whey protein post-work out, but thought it might be beneficial to do a pre-work out as well. 

Any of you folks find either pre or post workout supplements that support the paleo diet?  




 i could not agree more 




 total dog lesbians  




 someone goes around to parties and hides Jurassic Park trading cards in fun places. they then emailed us the next day from a fake email showing us the picture they posted on their tumblr. The email was signed by John Hammond, a fictional character from Jurassic Park. 

Clearly you guys aren't JP fans! 




 My roommates and I threw a big party over the weekend. We woke up to this email on Monday morning: http://i.imgur.com/1sLmP.jpg

We have no clue who it is, but it was signed by John Hammond, owner of Jurassic Park. 

Great joke. 

 




 put to good use!  









 he kind of looks like a jerk. i want to ask him if he's a jerk.  









 buy it an X-Box, bro 












































 From what I can tell, this is for Rize of the Fenix.  














 this is incredible 









 yep, just had some and it was glorious 






















































 you're totally right. and usually I'M the grammer nazi!  
























 they both have heads that could pick a lock

 My friends are in a kick-ass band but have been struggling to pin point what to tell people when they ask what kind of music they play. So, we're hitting the internet for answers! Best answer wins a hug.
