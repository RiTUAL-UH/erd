 What's the funniest joke you know? 




 Hey guys, we're doing a charity today called Replay for Life!  All money donated goes straight to Relay for Life, an organization helping to fight cancer.  We're live streaming our games today, so feel free to check it out, spread the word, and donate, via www.replayforlife.org! 




 Hello Gabe, Wolpaw, EJ, Ido, and Coomer!  Glad to have you guys here!

I was wondering if you had any tips for wannabe game developers who only have coding experience.  While I can code a game fairly well, I don't know many people who can do the artwork, nor do I know many people who can do the music/sounds, and while I want to get into the industry, it's been a long struggle.  What tips would you have for either meeting people who can do so, or finding ways around it (preferably under a college-student budget)?

On another note, any internships available at Valve, and if so, could I have one? XD 














 I've gotta say, Github made their generator very creative lol 




 Hey guys, a quick compo idea I posted a few days ago.  If this is not the right subreddit please just let me know (not on here too often still), otherwise enjoy!

The name of this minicompo is The Github Name Game.  When you create a repository on Github, it generates a random project name as a suggestion.  The idea with this is to create an entire project based around whatever name you get (for example: I got duck-batman XD).  If you're interested, post the entry on my blog post below.  I'll try to keep an eye on this thread (or elsewhere if it get's moved).  No prizes or anything for this as of yet, but even if there are none, it's still a good resume booster I'd say!

 From what I've seen mostly. The only limitation is the size of the room, which would get better with tech (going to be using the new alpha Kinect with it soon since that can see further).  




 The reason I ask this is because most definitions of it define it as simply a room you can interact within (usually with holograms, though other demos use similar tech as this) and also label themselves as holodecks, so if there's some part I missed, do feel free to say.  




 Maybe I'm missing something then, what exactly do you qualify as a holodeck? 









 Essentially the idea would be to create a penetration testing group (hacking team) and follow them around with a camera on whatever jobs they get for companies.  I did a really in-depth description about this on my blog, so feel free to read about it more in depth here: http://gemisis.blogspot.com/2014/04/hack-it-tv-show-idea.html

This was just one of the crazy ideas I dreamt up while attempting to sleep one night (Why must the mind do this??? XD) 




 Being able to do a ton of them in bulk with a cup was what I was pointing out.  It'll let you make a dozen of them without having to wait for them to all cool individually. 














 I honestly don't really think any current AAA developers will take advantage of VR best.  I think we may see new AAA developers popup as a result of VR honestly, assuming that VR takes off this time around. 





























 My favorite Star Wars ship is the Voyager, and my favorite Star Trek captain is Han Solo. 




 Huge fan Bill!  Just wanted to ask, what are your thoughts on all of the gifs on the internet with you in them? 




 I cannot up-vote this enough........ 




 I hadn't seen any simple C++ libraries for the Oculus Rift other than the normal SDK, which seemed a bit overly complicated, so a friend and I made one for our senior project.  It also includes support for the Microsoft Kinect, and I'll be adding support for the recent updates to the Rift SDK soon.  I've also got a new Kinect 2.0 that I plan to add as well.

https://github.com/gemisis/Project-Virtua

We have a website over at http://www.projectvirtua.com that includes documentation and stuff too.  There's also some example projects you can look at as well there. 




 If you could go back in time and change one thing about the original Tony Hawk's Pro Skater games, what would you change and why?

Side note, huge fan! :D 




 It's the one where [Hey, Who turned out the lights?](/spoiler) 









 $20 I don't have sadly.  Most of the tech here I'm either borrowing or was given to me as a gift. 




 If I had the money for UE4 that may have been an option, but assuming it has Kinect support then yes, that would look better. Big goal here was to do so on a low software budget.  




 Yeah, we were kind of pressed for time XD I'll try and get a better demo setup at some point that shows the Kinect off. First goal is to get it to use the new alpha sensor though.   
























 Both servers were driving distance from where I was staying. In fact, the servers both claimed to be in the same city. Would have kept the cities in the image, but according to [Da Rules](http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20140907220547/infusiongaming/images/4/47/Da_Rules.jpg) all personally identifiable information has to be removed :( 














 When deciding on passwords, what would you recommend to do to make them as secure as possible? (Outside of password managers) 




 That's a fake (footage from games) 









 Yep, I've done all of that and it's still draining just as fast.  Worried now it might be a physical issue with the battery.  Gonna try to call Motorola tomorrow since they put me on hold for an hour today T_T 




 After the most recent, my moto360 started having great battery life.  Then, randomly this past weekend, it's life shot way down.  It only lasts for a max of 5 hours now.  Has anyone had this issue?  No settings have changed, and even untethering it from my phone kills it in the same amount of time.

Edit: After sending it back to Motorola and getting a new one, the issue has been resolved.  If you experience battery issues like this with a moto360, it might be worth calling support as this seems to be a hardware issue with the batteries where it can't hold a charge long enough essentially. 




 The Star Wars prequels are awful 




 Depending on the cost I may be interested. You have a cost estimate so far? 


































 Not gonna lie, completely missed that first post lol 














 https://twitter.com/gemisisDev

I'm currently working on my first big game on the PS Vita (Keeping it private until I have something pretty to show... which is looking like it'l lbe in the next two weeks or so!)  I also do miscellaneous dev stuff, like helping with some 3DS homebrew stuff, running a C++ game development Twitch Stream, game jams (when time permits), and more.  Working to use Twitter more so recently, though I just want to Tweet about stuff that matters, cause I don't think people would find my ever day thoughts as fun lol That said, once my game is public, expect lot's of Tweets as I work on development more :) 




 Pretty sure that's the "YOU STOLE MY T.A.R.D.I.S.!" expression lol 




 Gonna call it now, he's a Terminator. 

And I kind of like the idea of that lol 









 All of my brothers friends, who are 6-10 years younger than me, are now either 6ft tall, getting their drivers, or going to college soon. 





























 The only thing that could make this better is if it was a perfectly looping gif.............. 









 So, I started deving for DK1 using the hardware my school had one semester. When I tried to continue the project over the summer without access to the hardware, I found there was nothing like what you mentioned. If this has changed now (which it seems it has as of December 2014) then obviously that's good, but as a product that will just be starting out, it's important to do that from the beginning. 




 I am now more excited than ever to start developing games and apps on your platform. Thank you for being awesome! 




 This excites me way too much :D
If these golden tickets are true, count me in! 




 One of my biggest gripes with Oculus is the lack of an emulator for development. Is this something you guys are looking into? I really like developing for hardware like this, but sometimes the costs and limited quantities make it tough.  




 With the first iteration of whatever you guys are making at Magic Leap, how easily will developers be able to access tools to develop for it? 




 Don't forget, cocoa is also a fruit.

So you'd basically be drinking a smoothie.......... 





























 Recently I had someone request I make a Twitch stream on doing game development in C++.  I stuck with C++ and SFML, and went through and showed how to make several types of 2D games (pong clone, space invaders clone, a top-down RPG, and more).  While it's some rushed code (so as not to drag out each episode too much), it might be a decent resource to those who are interested.

You can find the entire season on my Youtube channel here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOFi3QmBRyyMnw0PHVM7smZh9Iw8a8WA7

I'm working on some new content for my Youtube account (game dev and programming related), as well as planning out a second season for my Twitch stuff (and focusing on increasing the quality of what I put online).  The big thing that I'm going to make better for the next season is having things a bit more prepared beforehand, as well as making sure the last episodes aren't me just sitting around rambling as much.

Any feedback on this is welcome of course.  I hope people find this useful!

You can find my Twitch stream at http://www.twitch.tv/gemisis/ 




 Okay, so this is based on the original idea I had when I made this (sorry, been running around all day so only just got to typing this haha):

-So the start of the video would be them dancing around in circles.
-Once the drums start, the start swinging in and out before fusing to Garnet.
-Lyrics go with Garnet dancing around
-Some kind of faster paced animation while singing goes
-Once "Go ahead and hit me if you're able" is sung, they split again and dance around, maybe introduce Jasper into the video and have the three of them fighting.
-Right before the first "We will always be twice the Gem that you are" they fuse back together, dancing around with Jasper at that point.
-Once the solo part starts, they split apart again, dancing around.
-Lyrics start again and they fuse together.

This is what I have for right now.  Feedback and such would be awesome :)

I've tried to add some personality to the current animation (it won't be the same every time), and was originally planning to have the animations change based on the beat, but still have an amount of random to look cool haha 




 Let's do it then! haha 




 If someone makes this, I will totally put it on there :D 




 I can understand where you're coming from.  Believe me, I'd love to have bigger prizes, it just takes time to establish oneself for something like that, and I'm just happy I can offer anything as a prize :)

And honestly, I kinda got excited for the socks.  I've never seen something like this before which made em unique imo lol Sadly these are prizes so I won't have any haha 




 So, this isn't being run by a company, it's by a single person, so really I'm talking with 1 or 2 people I know at these companies to get us these prizes.  They (Google and Microsoft) are putting their trust in me not to run off with everything (which I greatly appreciate), so I can understand why they wouldn't want to just hand out a $300 phone as a prize to something like this.  And of course I don't plan to run off with them to start with. :)

Hopefully in the future I'll be able to do this again with better prizes though if this one goes well :) 




 Easiest way to do it: Buy domain separate, and host on Google Drive.

As long as you don't mind losing server-side control, you can setup some pretty fancy sites with it. 




 There's a few different places you can use.

Recently I've been sticking with Google Domains (domains.google.com).  They're a bit more expensive than normal, but they have high quality management tools imo.  Another good one that is cheaper is namecheap.com, though they can be a bit confusing to use if just starting out. 




 I bought the domain, threw some 3D spheres together with WebGL, made em move, and add the song from somewhere I found haha

Edit: Would love to have 3D models in place of the spheres, but sadly I can't model to save my life

Kinda surprised it wasn't bought already 





























 Thank you! :) Wish there was more I could say than just thank you on here haha 




 Sorry, not quite sure what you are talking about here.  If you mean "where is the iOS/Android dev", well... I could do android (don't have a mac) depending on the interest. 




 Haha, yeah, I've been a bit of a worry-wart when it comes to posting here.  partially because I haven't been sure whether people would enjoy it, partially because I'm super critical of myself, and worry about whether it's good enough.  It makes gives me confidence that you say this though, so thank you, and I'll do my best in the future to post it here/there more! :) 




 You're welcome!  I hope you find this all useful :) 




 Haha, yeah, I need to figure out a lot of noise issues (my apartment is too loud lol).  It gets better in future videos I think, but I'll make sure to double check it further in the future too :) 




 Of course! :) 




 Thank you! :) I've been contemplating how to do that still actually, and my only concern is I want to make sure that when I show that, I do so properly (especially since I want to avoid any deprecated OpenGL stuff).  While I'm 99% sure I'm fully up to date on everything, there's still a few minor things before I officially do that, but that's my current plan for season 2 :) 




 And in reference to your specific stream idea: Just go for it :) I did a test run with some extra videos prior, which is what motivated me to do more.  If you find yourself being less productive, then you can always stop streaming :) 




 Sure!

Honestly, I feel like overall it's had an incredibly positive impact.  Obviously because I'm doing the stream to make games, I've made a ton of games during this time, but there's also been a huge awareness to the quality of what I make as well that's occurred.  Now when I make a game, I find myself a bit less worried about the quality for my private code, but more worried when I publish things (which I think is good, though I suppose that's debatable).

The other big thing that's been helpful is that it's forced me to learn proper terminology, something I've pushed off a ton during my school years.  That is to say, making sure that when I am talking about references vs pointers, I am able to give a more technical definition, as well as a general explanation.  I'm still working on this personally, but it's a lot better than when I started.

Finally, I've learned about a lot of new tools for my videos, as I didn't want to spend a whole lot of time with setup and such.  Thus I've learned a lot more about other engines, in order to simplify my development.  As an example: I recently learned a lot about Three.js as another potential series.  So when I went to work one week and needed to use it, I was able to use it there, without needing to do a whole lot of extra research on what I wanted to do.

And obviously of course I've learned some new things about C++ and SFML along the way :)

TL;DR: My code quality awareness has gone up, my use of proper terminology has gotten better, and I've learned a ton of new APIs thanks to this stream. 




 Thank you!  It really excites me to see so many people interested in this! :) 
























 Wow, so this is actually something that I would have thought should not happen, but apparently does.  On the one hand, it makes sense.  On the other hand, I don't quite agree with this being handled in this way.

So, here is what is going on: You are deleting your enemies upon creation.  Because they are created as objects (IE: Not referenced objects via pointers), as soon as they are created, they are destroyed, because they are no longer in scope.  You need to make your array an array of pointers instead of an array of just objects.  (IE: enemy npcs[10]; needs to be made into enemy* npcs[10];).  Then, you can create each enemy using new, and call the destructor for each one with delete.

Honestly, I too am a bit surprised this is happening, and maybe it's a compiler thing as it seems wrong, but maybe I'm mistaken.

TLDR; Your objects are out of scope because your arrays is an array of objects, not pointers, so game::npcs[game::total] = enemy(x, y, 1); will result in their deletion immediately. 




 Just a quick look through the code, it looks like you may be moving the sprite off screen too quickly in void game::update() (you move every npc by 0.0002,0.0002 each iteration through, but there is no delaying this).  I would try removing that first and see if that fixes it. 




 Hey, sorry about the delay!

So, the problem in your code is that you *technically* are deleting your enemy's texture.

When you create your enemy it its constructor (enemy::enemy(int x, int y, int type)), you create a local texture variable (sf::Texture texture;).  Notice that this is not a pointer to a texture, but is a new texture object in that constructor.  When your constructor exists however, it gets rid of all local variables created within there.  In this case, because you created a new object, and not a pointer to an object, it will delete your texture when exiting the enemy constructor, thus creating the white square problem.  Remember, any time a method finishes, it cleans up everything.

*Technically* pointers also get destroyed, but what they reference does not!  Hence, a quick solution to fix this is to change your texture to a pointer (sf::Texture* texture;) and create it using the new keyword.  Make sure however that you keep that reference so you can delete it later, otherwise you will end up never deleting the texture object that is referenced, and will end up with a nice memory leak.

I hope I've worded everything clearly, but if not, feel free to keep asking questions :) 




 I can give it a shot :) do you have your code somewhere because that'll make it a bit easier. 




 While this could be possible, I actually have another theory that I'm going to attempt to put together this weekend, that would require only 2 or 3 motors (potentially).  I'm finishing up the designs, so we'll see how it goes.

Hopefully I can keep it fairly cheap cause I really want to have my own army of BB8s XD 




 Can't be wheels. If you watch the video footage, the head is able to be on the side of the body, where it would fall if only moved by wheels. Also, there's a shot during his close up where the head moves around the top of the ball (and down towards the sides a bit, just a small amount) but the body stays completely and perfectly still. It is definitely using some sort of magnetism.  




 What I imagine this giraffe is thinking: http://imgur.com/MhTGEbQ 




 Thank you!  I'll make sure to definitely post it there then :) 




 Ahh!  Well according to the changelog, supposedly support for iOS and Android is in it, but maybe not?  Would be interesting to try and port it over if it's not already.

See here: http://www.sfml-dev.org/changelog.php#sfml-2.2 




 You're quite welcome!  SFML is super fun, and I especially enjoy how quickly I can get it up and running.  That said, I'm excited to add some more APIs to the videos I make too :) 





























 First off, my brothers and I were/are huge fans of your show!  Really awesome that you're still doing stuff with acting!  My question: What are you some "odd" hobbies you have? 




 Speaking of which, I've actually had a neat idea for #2 recently lol 




 Oh man, I remember watching that finale when it appeared.  I still to this day consider it to be one of the absolute best season finales I've ever seen.  It has served as inspiration to me on many levels in what I design.

That said, I was disappointed with how they handled it after.  I was hoping they would really play up the fact that he was this brilliant doctor in a psychiatric hospital more, but then they ended up using it for only a couple of episodes.

 And then there's this lol (Though OPs is still awseome)

 See, this gives me hope that some of us small-timers will be able to get one still :) Here's to hoping! 




 Can anyone confirm that they received an email from valve after registering? Kinda curious as it sounds like this is about developers who already had access in some way, not the ones who signed up on their page.  




 Whoops, sorry about the delay!

So, when I say "cleanup" I mean delete any pointers you've created essentially in this particular case.  So for example, for your array of pointers for npcs you need to free each one that you've created, in order to ensure that they don't keep hogging the memory you gave them. 




 This, so much this. I used to install Firefox to use instead of IE and my family would blame it for slowing down the computer when it wasn't even running (and  had ample hard drive space yes).  If anything went wrong with any tech I was at fault, but they wouldn't listen to my suggestions for things. As an aspiring programmer and maker at the time, it was a major blow to my confidence with tech looking back on it now.

It wasn't until I was halfway through my degrees in computer engineering and computer science at college and had an internship that my parents FINALLY started trusting me around their computers. Now that I have a full time job, they're slowly starting to ask me for advice too. 

TLDR; parents didn't trust me with technology until I got a career in the field even though I'd done fine with it for years. 




 (*game::npcs[game::total]).setPos(x,y); is a bit silly, I would just use game::npcs[game::total]-setPos(x,y);, but yeah, that'll work technically.

Uhh, basically you need to cleanup any resources associated with that enemy (textures, etc.) 




 Look into shared pointers. They have a limited garbage collection system that might prove useful when starting if you are worried about memory leaks and such. 

The problem is that pointers are one of the big reasons that C++ is used as you gain big speed and performance gains. If you aren't using them, you may want to look into other languages to make your life easier.  




 Sorry about the delay, just got home from work.  See my response above for a fix :)
