 Thank you. It happened little over a month ago. It took me some time to bring myself to write about it. 

I've told a few people I'm close to. Most seemed sympathetic (or at least didn't verbalized their skepticism).  




 Hi R/Nosleep. I havn't been able to sleep for a while. 

Sometimes I stay up late. I love my wife, so much. So so much. But, sometimes I stay up late. My wife goes to bed, and I stay up. Redditing or playing video games, or watching T.V... 

I'd fallen asleep on the couch as I often do, and I awoke to my wife standing over me, crying, shaking me awake. I asked her what was wrong, but for a while she didn't speak. She just hugged me and sobbed. I stroked her hair and comforted her. 

I wondered if she might have had a dream that I died or something, or if maybe she'd received a text with some tragic news. Finally when she calmed down a little she said "Let's just sit together for a while." 

"Do you want to tell me what happened?" I asked. She seemed to think about it, and decide against it. "No. I just want to spend some time with you, for a little while." 

"I'm tired." I said, stretching. "Let's get in bed." "No!" she almost seemed to shout. "No. I don't want to go in the bedroom right now." I was concerned, but my wife could be a tad eccentric, sometimes even charmingly child like. Maybe going back in there would remind her of a nightmare she'd had?

We wound up sitting on the couch chatting. About anything and everything under the sun (except for what had upset her). We played portal. 

She made coffee, and we snacked on some left overs. We laughed, we reminisced about the early days of our relationship. Before we knew it, it was 7:00am. "I'm too tired, sweetheart, and I'm sure you are too. Let's get some rest so we don't waste our entire Saturday."

"No! We can't! Please!" She cried. "Why!?" I asked "What's the matter?" 

"We just can't go in there. Please. If we go in, it'll be over." She said, her eyes welling up with tears.

"What!? What's in the bedroom?" (I was really confused. Had she accidentally broken some heirloom, and she was afraid I'd be upset with her?) 

There was a long silenced as she fought back sobs. Then finally...

"My body is in there! I'm dead, Prakash. I saw my dead body, lying on the bed. Once you see it, it'll be over." 

This was a bit much. Obviously she'd had some nightmare, that she'd believed was real. 

"Oh, sweetheart, no. No...it was just a bad dream. Everything is ok." I hugged her as she sobbed. "Look, you're just sleep deprived. You'll feel better when you wake up. I promise."

She nodded somberly, then walked silently, with me to the bedroom. I gestured to the empty bed, completely devoid of bodies. 

"See there? It was a dream. Lay here with me." I flopped onto the bed playfully and then propped myself up on my elbow, to chat until we slept. She laid down next to me and closed her eyes. 

"So, what had you dreamt?" I asked. She didn't answer. "Diane?" I asked. "Did you really fall asleep that quickly?" I laughed.  

I shook her, and she was stiff. I noticed her lips were a little blue around the edges. Next I noticed she wasn't breathing. 

Of course I panicked. 

Of course I called 911. 

She was only 27 years old. An aneurysm in her sleep. The coroner said she'd been dead for five or six hours before I "found her body".  

I miss her so so much. I hope my promise is kept - where ever she is now, where ever she woke up, I hope she feels better.

 I saw her walk *through* a glass window, once. Like, just kind of *phased* through the window above my bed, as though it was open. 

I think she can pass through anything light can pass through. If you have wooden shutters, try locking them, or otherwise obscuring points of entry for light.  




 Holy shit. I'd definitely try to stay on Matt's good side, if I were you. 




 That is terrifying, do you have someone else you can stay with for a while? Dogs are a great alarm system and source of protection, please get one!  
























 I am very *very* thankful for that. I was something of a borderline-skeptic before. If I wasn't *so sure* that she still existed in this universe somewhere I think I would be in a much worse state of mind right now. I really needed those last few hours together, and I think she knew that. 
 




 Thank you for your kind words. It's a slight relief to share the weight of it with people who will listen without judgement.  




 Thank you. 

The doctors said she had an aneurysm, and the coroner listed it as "natural causes", which to me, just seems so baffling for someone her age. 

She didn't smoke and she wasn't over weight. She did have just slightly high blood pressure which runs in her family, but she took good care of herself and ate a good diet. 

She hadn't complained of any symptoms leading up to it so I don't know if she felt them or not. 

Since she was asleep when it happened, I personally really don't think she would have felt any pain or anything like that.  




 Please do. I'm happy for you and your wife, it's a comforting reminder that joy and love still exist out there, even if *I* am sort of on pause for a bit. 

Please, forget trivial disagreements, realize the value in every moment and make as many pleasant memories together as you can.  




 Thank you. I know maybe it sounds cliche, but writing about it has been a little therapeutic.  
























 Haha, that's sweet. I'm happy for you guys, treasure each other.  




 Thank you for your kind words.  




 I know it's easier said than done, but enjoying your time together is a million times better than worrying. Diane loved Portal. She would sing the songs from both. The graphics in Portal 2 gave her motion sickness, sometimes, though.   




 Thank you. I used to be cynical about such things but there's no way I could have survived this if Diane hadn't assured me that she's still out there somewhere. She knew that. 

I know she has to be a very pure soul in order to pull something like that off, so wherever she is now, must be a good place. She deserves that more than anyone I've ever met.  




 Thank you, and I do feel very fortunate for our last few hours together. I attribute that entirely to Diane being a very pure soul.  
























 My deepest, sincerest condolences. 

I hope you can see the experience as a gift.

I truly, truly do. I think it was a gift bestowed on Diane, because she's way more deserving of it than me. I'm very thankful for every single moment she spent in my life.  




 Thank you very much.  




 Thank you, sincerely. I feel like sharing it lifts a small portion of the burden off of me. Sometimes I feel guilty that I was given an opportunity that people more deserving than me long for. 

I can only guess that it was either: actually a blessing bestowed on Diane (as she deserved a granted wish more than anyone I know), or that I *needed* an experience like that more than most, due to my own spiritual weakness. 




 Thank you. I think I will. Eventually.  




 Thank you for your kind words. I'm grateful that my experience can be meaningful to others.   
























 At first I did. I really really did. I sobbed for hours just thinking "why did I go in". I spent days on the couch wishing I could see her standing over me. 

But ultimately, I don't think I can regret going in. 

I know that Diane must have been a very pure soul to achieve something like that, almost pure enough to attain Moksha (in Hinduism, it's freedom from rebirth. An extremely perfect state. Its *way* better than rebirth, but it's hard for we who aren't very spiritually advanced yet to grasp). 

I can't help that I wish I could see her again. But I also fear that her attachment to me could hinder her on her journey.

I'm sure that when she departed, she took birth in much better circumstances than in our house, worrying about me. 
 




 Thank you. I'm sorry for your loss, and I also sometimes feel guilty that Diane and I got to, essentially, say goodbye when most people don't. 

I don't think it's a matter of you being unlucky, though. I don't think this was given to me because I deserved it, but maybe because I *needed* it due to my spiritual immaturity and weakness. I do know that Diane deserved a chance to say goodbye though.  




 That's so very sad, I can't even stand to picture my wife in that situation. I wish that coupled had gotten the last moments together Diane and I had. When I first learned learned her death was caused by an aneurysm, it seemed like something that must be incredibly rare. But now when I tell people about it, it feels like everybody knows of someone who's died this way.  




 Really? I wasn't on here back then, can you link to it? I would be interested in reading about similar situations.   




 Thank you.  
























 I just searched through it myself, after reading your comment, and now feel a bit dumb. I remember thinking my tooth-fairy remark was funny as shit at the time (I was slightly drunk). 

It prompted a discussion between me and Diane, because I hadn't grown up with the whole tooth-fairy thing, and wanted to find out if she had believed in it.  




 Thank you, I would say that sharing it with others does reduce the burden. 

I don't want to try astral projection or anything like that, because I want Diane to go on to her next life and experience all the happiness she deserves. To be honest, I pray that she doesn't even remember me. I don't want her attachment to me to hinder her journey.  




 She was decent. She enjoyed solving the tests, but to be honest I think she liked the story lines more. Sometimes she got frustrated and watch walk-throughs. She also liked to watch me play.  




 I used to. But, I know she had to leave eventually. Her attachment to me shouldn't hinder her on her journey, and I want he to know that. I know she must be someplace as beautiful, and amazing as her now.  




 It's not silly at all. Diane and I always kept a white-board on our fridge, where we'd write things we needed to do, and our shopping list. 

Some things (errands we hadn't gotten to yet, and frequently purchased groceries) would just stay on there, cluttering up the board forever. 

The other day I went through the list to erase the things that had already gotten done (mostly things pertaining to Diane's funeral services, and my recent trip to India). 

I don't drink cashew milk, but Diane kept it on the list. I started choking up right after I erased it. 
 
























 Thanks, you too.  




 I keep getting comments like this, but I really don't know how to answer. I mean...can you imagine my own confusion? 




 Yes, we had played it, plus the left-overs and coffee were still out. That's how I know it wasn't a dream, and that I hadn't just woken up in bed and found her. 

I just got back from a three week long trip with my brother where we stayed with my aunt and uncle. I've been surrounded by nothing but friends and family, which definitely helps. 
 




 Thanks yaar.  




 I know I was conscious. The mugs and plates were still out from the coffee and left-overs we had.  
























 Thank you. 




 This is a really touching read. We all derive fulfillment through helping others. We all need to be needed. We're like gears, our interdependence is what gives our lives meaning. 

I found:

It gave me something to focus on besides my grief and turned me into someone my brother would be proud of.

especially inspiring. I'm really glad to hear you're doing better. Remember that those close to you have the same human need to help others, so don't be afraid to reach out to them. Take good care of yourself.  




 That's a sweet proposal story! I guesstimated my wife's ring size by casually letting her mess around with an old ring I normally wore. When she slipped it on, it seemed to fit perfectly, so I figured "If it fits me, it'll fit her" was a good philosophy for engagement ring shopping. 

Then when I bought the ring it was too big for her. Apparently my own ring was slightly tight on me and slightly loose on her. 

It was ok, because it's always easier to resize a too big ring than a too small ring (plus, a girl will feel embarrassed if her finger is too big to fit into the ring). Unfortunately I hadn't purchased the "re-sizing insurance" thing, so it was extra.  

TLDR: Always buy a slightly too big ring, and re-sizing insurance.   




 Thank you.  




 Yes it's my name (I don't normally give personal information, but I figured first names would be ok because I didn't expect many people to see this). I grew up in the U.S., but my parents are Indian. Take care.  
























 Thank you very sincerely. I'm thankful that I shared Diane's final act of love and devotion. Sharing it feels less lonely.  




 Thank you very much. The response has been more than I could have imagined, and I'm thankful that Diane continues to inspire joy and love, even after her passing.  




 Mujhe apni patni ki yada a raha hai apna khayal rakhna, dost. maf kijiye, mujhe Hindi nahee ati hai. mai U.S. se hum. My mom's from Delhi but my dad's from the South. We mostly spoke English at home. Apna Khyal Rakhna.
 




 My dad is Tamil, and my mom's from Delhi. They met here in the U.S. though. I didn't feel a particularly strong connection to North or South, which is I guess, why I wound up marrying a gora... 




 My parents are Indian, but I grew up in the U.S.  
























 "Prakash" was using an alias from the outset, besides which he was no innocent man. 

But, I have his lap-top now, and all his accounts were logged in when I found it in his living room. I don't much care if his reputation, and my confession get buried as far down as him.  




 That after his death his online accounts will be anonymously usurped and his reputation ruined.  




 I'm *really* sorry to hear about your sister, man. Do whatever you can to defender her, once you get out. Creepy-ass brothel owner...I tell you man, it's this damn city. It attracts the worst kind.  




 Nothing but great things, I'm sure. ;) 




 This Twigsy guy really knows his craft. I've got to respect that on some level.  




 You vaguely remind me of my creepy-ass, late brother-in-law.
 




 Aneurysm my ass, she was young and in great health, doesn't make sense.  




 I truly regret leaving home at age 16. They say I was estranged, but really Diane was the strange one. I may have spent my better years rabble-rousing and getting into trouble but that's how you turn out when you're a dumb-ass kid who runs away from home.

I just don't see how my parents let Diane turn out the way she did. By the time I was back in my baby sister's life, she was married to this sleazy, disingenuous "Prakash", guy. Now, I'm a born again Christian, that's why I ultimately turned myself around and came back home. But Prakash, he was hard to place. When I tried to talk to him about matters of faith, he'd claim to be an atheist, or agnostic. Or he'd say "There are many paths to God.", dodgy as fuck if you ask me, most likely because he came from some ass-backwards terrorist background.

I could tell, because Diane talked like she was part of some kooky spiritual cult. Plus, she was always acting like some provincial house wife: cooking for him, and tidying their home like a neurotic house keeper... Oppressive bastard.

Well, shortly after I returned from my exploits as prodigal son, Prakash stole my chance to make up for lost time with my beloved sister. Maybe he did it because he knew I could help her see the light again: the light of Christ, the light of her own upbringing, the light of modern society - the light to which my sweet sister had sympathetically blindfolded herself, on account of her marriage to that morally blind terrorist creep.

I find the circumstances of Diane's death highly suspicious, as there were no witness besides Prakash. And, do you know what that mother fucker did, right after killing my dear sister? He took a three week vaction to India. He took Diane's ashes along with him, selfish bastard. So now we don't even have a grave site to visit her at. He claimed that she had mentioned, on a few occasions, wishing that her ashes be placed in some "Yamina River". Why on earth would my sister want a nutty thing like that?

Well, according to Prakash, he believed Diane sent him out on this wild quest because she secretly thought it would be good for him. That she would have wanted him to take his mind off his grief by going on an adventure, and finally getting in touch with his distant family members in India.

Sure, Prakash. I'm so sure Diane's final wishes were all about you, man. I'm sure she was so concerned about helping you find some inner-peace-enlightenment-bullshit at the bottom of some filthy river. Right. It wasn't so you could go search for a new terrorist bride or anything like that at all, now was it...

But by now you can see, why Prakash had to die.

I went over to his house, around ten at night. I brought two six packs of beer, thinking it would make my job easier, but from the look and smell of him when he opened the door I could tell what I brought was negligible compared to what he'd already imbibed.
I told him I was missing Diane, and asked if I could come in and chat. He let me in, and cleared some blankets off the living room couch so we could sit. The living room was a mess, the coffee table was littered with excessively dogeared and folded-open books. 

Empty beer cans adorned the floor. I shoved some books out of the way (knocking some to the floor to join the beer cans) to make room for the six packs.

Prakash seemed amiable enough, but drunk and half asleep. After enough small talk and beer was had, I got down to the heart of the matter. "I miss my sister, Prakash. I hadn't seen her in such a long time, and once I was finally back in her life, she was taken from me." I had hoped this would stir something in that guilty conscience of his, but he just muttered some self-righteous bullshit about her being in a better place.

I finally cut to the chase. "Did you kill her, Prakash?" My question seemed to cut through his stupor, as he stared at me, wide eyed, and stammered a denial.

"Well, we'll let fate decide, shall we." I said as I produced the first gun from my jacket. Prakash watched as I loaded a single bullet, and spun the cylinder.

I set the gun down on the table in front of us, then produced the second (fully loaded) gun and trained it on Prakash. "This is called Russian Roulette. I know you killed my sister, now this is your judgement day. If you refuse to let God be your judge, then I will be your judge. Now, there is an eleven in twelve chance you will be spared. Do you really think God would let that one in twelve bullet find it's way into your head, if you're truly an innocent man?"

"My God, Don, I didn't kill her! I loved her! I still love her! I did not kill Diane!" he shouted, sweat now beading up on his face.

"Don't invoke God if you're not willing to let him judge you." I said. "And, believe me when I say I am up to the task of acting on his behalf. Your deadline is fast approaching Prakash. Decide and make your peace. 10...9..."

As I began my count down Prakash cast about the room as though looking for escape or help, and I leaned in closer with my own gun, inches from his face. He picked up the gun from the table and held it to his head. His breath quickened until he was practically hyperventilating. 

With his other hand he picked up a near by picture of Diane and stared at it. I was hoping he'd utter a confession or an apology. "Truth alone triumphs." he said in a quavering voice, and then pulled the trigger.

The gun emitted an impotent "click" and nothing more... 

*God Dammit! do I have to do everything myself!? What the hell happened to that sure-fire bullet I'd left in the chamber!? Had the fucking thing jammed!? Oh well, I guess God does help those who help themselves.* 

I grabbed a pillow and shoved it against the back of Prakash's head, while he was vomiting on the floor. The silencer and pillow reduced the sound and mess of the gunshot.

A garbage bag nicely concealed the body and accompanying evidence, as I loaded them into my truck. An apparent suicide would have been more ideal, but from what I understand Prakash was sort of the black sheep of his own family. And if there's one thing I've learned it's that when you're a black sheep, no one looks 
very hard for you.

I drove Prakash's body so far into the dessert, that it'll be at least a decade before the shores of our ever expanding city approach it, and buried it so far down that even the vultures will never get a tantalizing glimpse.

See you in hell, asshole. 




 Thanks a lot, yaar :) 




 Thank you.
