 That is amazingly wonderful. In highschool I never had a boy friend and going to dances was always a thing us friends did in a huge group!!! GGG 




 This reminded me of my boyfriend, 9 years Army. The love of my life, lost. We will meet once again my love. 




 If you're worried about anything supernatural, I suggest having a couple cameras set up around the room. And watch carefully and thoroughly. 




 Would be mine too. 




 Lol fuck that, normally not one toget into this argument but IPhone is ass and yes, I am using one/own one. Worst phone I've ever owned. Dot cars for apple products in general was given to me. You don't just stop being blind because of apple lol 


P.S- extremelyintoxicated right now will regret this later 




 Congrats! Big step for him. But do not take his showing of no interest personally ever. Although it may be hard to deal with sometimes he will get there eventually. Each child goes at their own pace.


But again congrats! 




 Not an unpopular opinion. As a waitress/smoker and restaurantuer I cannot stand when people bring their children into our restaurant. 




 Beyond handsome. 




 Dope shirt in the bottom picture, how did you stumble into that?  




 I'm a bartender at two restaurants and nothing kills me more than this gluten free fad. I understand some people really cannot have gluten but the ones that can.....

My new response to people that ask what on our menu is gluten free I now tell them 'Sir/ma'am, anything that had a face.' 




 Whack 




 Microwave your spoon and catch your house on fire orrrrrrrr stick the spoon in hot water and not be a dumbass. 




 Because I had the luxury of being able to go on spring break and to play sports, granted I bought my first car and am still driving it to this day, but my parents had money when I was his age. My parents at this point both have jobs but at their age it's so difficult to find something like he had before making that amount of money. I wanted to help, I want my siblings to have a somewhat 'normal' life like I did. That's why I do what I do. It was my choice. I couldn't stand to see my family suffer anymore. 




 Without even trying 




 Amazing! 




 I grew up with those trees all down my street, I always thought they smelled like cod. 




 They typically form from ingrown hairs. 




 WTF SAME! Sylvania!  




 It is a cyst. I'm not an esthetician or anything but have gone numerous times to get those removed, I stopped going because I love popping things so I do it myself. I pierce the skin with a sewing needle after sanitizing it and it has to go through the layer of skin and the sack the cyst is in. It will hurt. Then squeeze. The process is a little painful and if your not grossed out easily I suggest you do it yourself. Sometimes they just explode when you least expect if so I do it myself so it doesn't happen at the wrong time. Hope that helped a little.  




 Fello oHIGHo tokerr, hence my user name. Wish we could blow down, that would make me one happy girl!  




 That's how you should be.  









 LOL 




 Calle Ciega is the name of the band.  




 Yes, I was in Venezuela visiting family and this guy had taken real interest in me. My cousin was freaking out, so excited that this guy was talking to me. Surprisingly he was very fluent in English and that made me really happy. We danced on the beach, had dinner and an amazing time. One thing led to another and we ended up sleeping with each other. The next day my cousin told me who he was. Turns out he was in what we here would call a 'boy band.' South Americas Backstreet Boys. Even though I didn't know it at the time afterwards I felt an odd sense of accomplishment. Like "I just did a celebrity." Never saw him again, but did download his album off iTunes.  





























 Will post my picture soon!  




 Any chance this came from someone in northwest ohio? I swear I saw this on a girls facebook page a few weeks ago.... 




 Melatonin should do the trick, it works for me every time. Good luck- hope you find the remedy right for you. Cheers 




 That's okay then it will be all juicy and fun! I canny wait to see, thanks for sharing.  




 You go girl!  




 Passing my blunt to you. TOKE ON!  




 Ask someone to get it with a bobby pin or a comedone extractor.  




 Dem blackheads.... 




 As an avid cocaine lover I want to lick that off of her then eat her pussy. She's not bad looking at all. 




 Congrats handsome! We all deserve happiness- even if it only lasts a moment. 




 Try  /r/beards !!

But I do love it!  




 Looooool hahahaha LOL  




 Heaven! Simply beautiful. 




 Yessssssssss! 




 When I was younger and played a lot of sports I had horrible acne on my back in the outline of my sports bra. One day I was trying to get rid of some of the acne and came upon this really massive bump under my skin. So I started to squeeze and squeeze, it hurt so bad. I called my mom into the bathroom and told her to get it out. Once it was fully out it was the hardest most odd looking thing just like that! It was the size of your standard pill capsul. I dropped it on the floor and it made a clinking sound. I'm assuming it was a really old blackhead built up from over the years!  




 LOLOLOLOLOLLOL 




 That's appalling. 

Good luck resting in Peace you selfish asshole. 




 Its fake. And call me crazy but it looks like an image of Jesus in that round white thing when you zoom in, but I'm really stoned so that could be it. 




 I could do that! Lol 




 Perfect! I love getting ride of them!  




 I didn't 'force' him to do anything, he asked me to do it and then complained the whole time.  




 He wouldn't let me take an after picture, he was squirming the whole time and threw away the napkin! We didn't get a long hence the ex boyfriend part! Haha 




 I got them out with an extractor. And if you do not have one, the loop part of a bobby-pin works just as well!  









 I wanna get that  




 OHIO! 
























 /r/popping  




 That's happened to me a few times, I have worked at the same Country Club for 6 years. Each time they get closer to me.  




 Wtf did I just read?  




 Left over blow- duh... 




 Hello neighbor!  




 Toledo, Ohio.  




 I want to have really intense, mind blowin sex in there then take pictures of the handprints. 

Is that weird?  




 You. Your man-bun. Your beard. 

Ever close to Ohio, let me know.  




 Your mike has a blackhead. Lol that's what I see atleast 




 If only.... 




 Quite clever  




 Idk that nipple tho.... 




 For this, I would have also. I'm losing my mind. 




 Pull be pregnant in a couple months.  




 Post this to /r/popping and take a look at some of the other Plantar Warts on there!  




 I think it's strangely hot. 




 Hairy bum. 




 Maybe that's why Gary meows in Spongbob 




 Cyst* and share this on /r/popping they would enjoy it.  




 I cannot find it, I dug for it.. 









 Thank you for delivering OP!  




 I've always used a bobby pin or an extractor. It helps to have someone help you with the ones in your ears. SOMEONE WITH A STEADY HAND. You DO NOT want someone to slip and rupture anything inside your ear. 

Happy popping!  




 I would love to see a picture of the bathroom. 

I'm a medium. I have spoken to the deceased for years, starting when I was about 6-7. (21/f) Not only that I'm an active member at our local paranormal group. People have brought me into their homes to try to figure out what was going on. 

You need to research the property, and surrounding areas land. You need to be sure that no one in the home has brought home any new items. 

Please be aware that even though you told this entity to leave does not mean it will not return. (I am not trying to scare you.) 

We like to say that sometimes spirits will go dormant. They do also cycle. Haunt at specific times of the year, things like that.

Please post pictures, I would love to see the dog also. 

Best of luck to you, and remember- we are never alone. We chose to see what we allow ourselves to.  




 I don't think that is harsh at all...any crime against a child is haneous.  




 Let's find these girls and slap them, too many people I know have does from Molly. She is not your friend. 
























 Dabbbbbbbbbed 




 Hell yeah I will! I need a large cover up here soon, will stop in on a day off!  




 Dear brother, 27 years you will never get back. No matter the amount of money you will receive for this it can never make up for the things you wanted and hoped for.  I feel for you and I hurt for you. May you be free to do as you please. 27 years you stared at those gray walls hoping things weren't the way they were. I am honored you are a part of this community again and I hope justice is brought to those who it is bestowed upon. 

Love from Toledo 




 Cheers from Sylvania! 




 Having an alcoholic father and being an alcoholic myself, please do not stop this journey. I found my father for dead after a long day of us both binge drinking (not together) and was so messed up I couldn't save him myself. I hope the best for you and your journey. I wish my father could watch me go through mine.  




 Wait- do you have an extra tooth?  




 Gummo!!!!! Wtffff  




 TaTU 




 Danielle? Doug? Greg?  




 The pimple does not do the mustache any justice... 




 I love you sir.  




 Handsome!  




 A dream of mine.  




 Confradulations Johnathan! You are an amazing being. Keep up the good work and always remember there are people out there you don't even know who admire you!!  




 /r/popping plz we would love this there  




 She had her "Dead girls Don't cry" tattoo then and a few others, smaller breasts, added a lot when she got into the film industry. I'm from Toledo so it was an easy drive.  




 She's one of my favorites. When she used to strip in Dayton friends and I would go see her.  




 The only porn star that has absolutely flawless skin is Bonnie Rotten. Plus she's stunning without makeup which is hard to find these days in the adult film industry.  




 My eyes 




 You poor thing.  




 First off I agree with the people that are saying it's the eyebrows. That's a big part of it. Also, the woman is AGING. We all get older and all age differently. She hasn't been using fillers either...leave the woman alone. We have other issues in the world to worry about other than her appearance. Priorities people.  




 Damn Catholics. 




 You are beautiful! 




 As a graphic design artist you can clearly tell this is photoshopped. Better luck next time!  




 Ypuuuu first set are gorgeous. 




 This melts my heart. 
























 Grrrrr 









 I tried and my pinky muscle instantly was strained! 




 I'm 22 and my ex is 37. We never found it strange. I got along better with him than any guys my age. 




 Now you're forced to wash you hand you sickos... 









 It kinda looks like a foot  




 YAAAAASSSSS! 




 I've always had a crush on 50, now I'm in love with him. 




 Hims kinda cute  




 Lmao it's because your hair is so corse and so much. But PENIS THUMBNAIL LOOK ALIKE 




 Glorious. 




 Thank you for your service!  




 Gotta love Krogers 




 What if you got really drunk one night and ended up going home with him. Drunk like you have long passed blacked out...you wake up in the morning at the not tattooed side of the face is laying on the pillow next to you. He then rolls over..... OUT! DONE! 

Idk why that was the first thing that came to mind when I saw this post. 




 Damnit Ohio- after that big win then you pull something like this!  




 I have done this since I was about 13, I used to go after school with my homework and layout.  




 Face... 




 MISTRESS!! She's smart.. 




 Well I'm sure it's nothing you haven't heard before..sometimes we need a little reminder lol 




 The Gods did us women a favor when they created you!  




 Lol OP I used to work at Nick   Jimmys! Hahaha 




 That is glorious!!  




 Bass..........head 




 Thanks everyone. I know he won't see this, I'm not a complete moron- but I think it's important to always say what you feel. Even if he can read it there are other people out there who can. And who knows, maybe one day he will.  




 Right on! Kills how crooked this world can be. 419 
























 BULLS EYE.  




 Thanks!! 




 Where is this?! I'm off Centennial and see things like this all the time. 




  Meowwwwwww 




 STOP! I LOVE THIS! 




 I work at a 4.5 star restaurant. We feature tons of amazing craft beers and wine on tap. This is one of our featured beers of the month. 









 Every creature can be good  




 I hate this I'm scared  




 Cheese graters  




 This isn't even popping. It's pulling out staples....idk just not my idea if this sub I guess.  




 I met him in Miami a few years back. He was taking shots of tequila 2 days after he left Celebrity Rehab with Dd. drew. Seemed fine at first then he got more and more out of control.  




 For some reason this reminds me of HIMYM when Lily goes to Marshall's for the Holidays. All it is missing is the potato chip crumbles. 




 SQUIRT 




 Lilacs.... 




 Toledo?  




 Youse look like siblings. 




 Well thank you for that bit of knowledge. !! 




 I have one too! My doctor calls it a "sinus cavity". I have one of each ear. You are not alone.  




 Deeeeeerbed 




 It all happened so quickly. He bumped it with a Q-Tip and the whole thing burst right away.  




 Oh Yeahh, you know it!  









 Ohio is like that sometimes.... 




 I know your doppelgnger. 




 My inner thighs get these all the time. Being female and working in a bar I'm constantly walking/power walking and it's mostly heat rash. My doctor told me to always leave them be and just continue to use my Proactive on them cause "it can't hurt". But this one was different it felt hard so I had to squeeze! Really glad I did. 
























 To work my ass off to go back to school and not have to pay student loans.... 




 I remember switching from private to public schools...private schools everyone had brand-new art supplies. Crayons, makers, pencils, pens... This one kid in particular came from a very under privileged family.. I noticed his crayons one day, seeing that they were old and had been used a while ago. I took the money out of my piggy-bank and bought him a new pack. At the age of 7. To this day I will never forget the smile on his face when he found/opened up that new box of crayons that randomly appeared in his desk. 

 




 Something Corporate 




 God Bless the World, this is why I drive a Ford. Such amazing people. Love from Ohio my dear Redditor! 




 I'm from the Midwest, where pop is a soda and ranch is out on everything.  




 Gotta love Frank Zappa 




 Most of us women at the age of 12. If I can recall one girl named Meredith- she had called me a cow and said I was possessed by the devil. So I threw a chalk board eraser at her head. We went to catholic schools. She got a sucker for the pain, I got scolded, detention and 4 wonderful weeks of counseling by our parish sisters.  




 I think I have enjoy the concept of the show. The retired PI and the psychic/medium. Goodness, hopes down. But it's all good!  




 What gets me about her sketches is that when there are creatures or other entities the way she describes them and the sketches totally freak me out. The one that I will never forget, this image has stuck with me for moths was of the creature that she claimed to be an evil spirit in someone's hallway. It was a black mass with a round shaped mouth. It looked like it would suck the life out of you. I've seen something similar before and it just really struck me as real.  




 Does anyone on here watch Dead Files? If so how do you feel about Amy Alan? Being somewhat sensitive myself I feel as if she is the realest.  




 I wanna kick this ladies ass. For real. Being a girl and playing street hockey as a kid not ONE adult complained. They were so happy we were playing streey hockey and not doing drugs like the other. Bitter bitch. She needs to grow the fuck up. If it is that big of a deal talk go the parents not 12,year old kids. Fucking moron.  




 I can see the eye. It blends right in like it belongs in the darkness. When I noticed it I felt a huge weight in my chest. 


I cannot say I am a professional psychic/medium but I do know I have abilities and many "professionals" have shared that same information with me. 

Try saging the house. All corners, door ways, every room including the attic. This can be done at any time, if you are more comfortable with the daylight do it then. Say something to bless the house and be rid of the spirits. Send them on their way to the actual afterlife. Another thing that I do whenever staying somewhere new, hotel, house, whatever- salt. Salt gets rid of negative energy. Windowsills, door ways and EVERY CORNER.  




 Upvote because it is disturbing that I'm intrigued and he is so young. 

Shame on me. 




 Just for a day! Or weekend.  




 ROLLING ROCK! My favorite. Touring the brewery this summer.  




 Come work at the Sylvania/Toledo Waffle House please.  




 He's awesome!  




 Idk how to isert pics on my phone lol  




 I'm only 22 years young, and nothing makes me feel old until my 9yo sister tells me my boobs are saggy.

Edit: they are immaculate 44DDD 




 I agree with this whole 100%. My boyfriend is an AMAZING guy. He knows absolutely every way to please me, mentally, physically, emotionally. He's not as big as some of the other men I have dated prior to him but that doesn't bother me at all. He's so wonderful and good with everything else it truly isn't something I think about.  




 Just keep swimming !! 




 Face looks like he's got a dildo shoved up his ass hole 




 Human eyes. 




 Idk maybe like 5-6 large ones and a couple handfuls of small ones. Steven Tyler is my spirit animal.  









 LOL WHAT THE FUCK.







I'd lose it. 
























 I am currently on POF. I have also labeled myself as "average" body type. I gained some weight when my kate fianc passed away. I have always been in great shape, and I am a very attractive woman. (I have been told by so many people throughout my life. No I do not have a big head.) Figured it would be good to get back into dating online and try things out. Although my body type says "average", I have lost 30+ in a few short months. I still have more to go. But by eating healthy and actually getting out of bed and starting my days makes that much of a difference- I was so depressed for the longest time. I do let the men I talk to know that I am on this journey and if they can accept me now, they will be more accepting when I reach my goal. 

I'm not telling you this to feel bad for me or anything, just sharing so you know not all "fatties" wanted to be that way. And that some of us are making the conscious effort to better ourselves.  




 Some people are so strange.  




 One time my (ex) boyfriend ate me out at a restaurant under the table. It was a really dark restaurant and the table clothes were touching the ground. The waiter came up to the table and realized he was missing said I could order for him if I knew what he wanted. I told her to come back in ten minutes that he left his wallet at home. Honestly that was the best ever and I do not feel guilty about it at all.  




 This has to be the funniest shit I have seen in FOREVER 




 Brandon Novak heroin.  




 That girls hair extensions look lime sheeeeiiiiittttt 




 STFU?! As sick as that is- completely badass. CHEERS.  




 Ohio is 80 




 This makes my heart happy.  




 I love you 




 Prozac saved my social life. My family could deal with my crazy shit but people around me didn't know how...Once I was put on meds, I actually had a true friend. 




 Hey, any time. Went through that recently as well. Roommate burned my kitchen down.  




 Positive vibes your way.  




 I worked at this place called The Barn. It literally is an old red barn from the 20's and opened as a bar in 1934. Anyways, we had a regular (way before my time), whose name is Frank. He passed away about 6-7 years ago. His wife still comes in. He was a huge Captain Morgan drinker and we have his "last bottle" in a shrine/glass box. Frank was know to really dislike rap music so when we had DJ's come in he would flight glasses straight across the bar. Not just push them, as if he was throwing them. When employees, including myself, would be making a burger in the back he would tell us when to flip them. Often I would be checking an I.D of someone's and if they were. underage I would get awalsy a swift tap on on the right shoulder. We knew it was him, never failed to amaze us though. 









 Mean Girls 




 First off I live on the edge of suburbia and corn fields. This girl got so drunk she said that she wanted to drive out to the country and hold a family hostage and torture them. She went into extreme detail about this. The whole time with a huge grin on her face.  




 I own a trailer. Nice one. Newly renovated. Got a roommate. He was struggling with some things had him pay $250 a month in rent. Cheap. Told him no smoking in the house. He got drunk and decided he wanted to make fried chicken. Started the process and then passed out on the couch with a cigarette burning. To my surprise it wasn't the cig that caught my trailer on fire.... He burnt the chicken. Caught my stove on fire and slept threw the whole thing. I work in a bar so I was just getting home around 4 A.M when I saw the paramedics, fire trucks and police officers. He came out unscathed and moved out the. next day. While I had no place to live considering majority of my place was gone. I had to move back home with my parents. Shit sucks. 

He got his karma a few months later- got pulled over for a DUI in someone else's truck with no insurance.

EDIT: I have multiple bad roommate stories. I have always had bad luck in this department. 




 Yeah of course, my cottage is right by there. Scio, Ohio. And I went there for a "religious retreat" (I went to Catholic schools didn't exactly have a choice!) 




 I'm from Sylvania, Ohio! Small world. About 30 mins from Yipsi. 




 What really kills my self esteem is when I'm having a great night at work, no tables have complained and everything is prompt. (Fine dining) And then all of a sudden a cook calls you a cunt in front of all the staff because HE fucked up the timing on the ticket. Broke me down. My tables heard and everything. Real self esteem killer.  




 Very interesting, thank you!  




 And what is the material they are made out of?  




 I always thought the Sorell had a little citrus flavor to them. I used to eat them all the time. Still do!  




 Ya and God forbid I wear actual panties and not a thong and my friends point it out. Jackasses ha 




 I just watched the trailer and I am terrified.  
























 True story. I remember some of the oddest people would take hits of acid with me and I never would have thought.  




 University in Ohio. I've always been an herbal kind of gal. Hence TORCHHTOKE, good grades, degree, and the curiosity to dabble with other things such a shrooms and every once in a while acid. Always ending back in the dorm. (I have a great buddy system.)

My roommate on the other hand...not so smart. She started doing heroin. She came from a small town outside Cleveland. Since she lived so close she normally stayed there, eventually failing out because she missed so many classes. 

Well turned out, one day after I ate some shrooms with my gay best friend and went to a local hole in the wall bar and got decently fucked up and we walked back. Opened the door. And there is my roommate, looking like a scene from a horror movie. Wet hair covering her face squating over my coffee pot taking a shit into it. She obviously was zooted out of her mind because it took her a good minute to realize we were staring at her. She then proceeded to pick up her shit and throw it at us. 

I was boomin so hard that I started laughing then ran away. When the RA came to the room they found her laying on the bathroom floor covered in her shit. Obviously called the authorities. When our room was searched I told them exactly what I had in my drawer safe. Condoms, birth control, a 8th of shrooms and $2000. When the cop opened it up he looked at me. Tossed me my baggie of shrooms. And said "We will be searching the rest of the room now you may leave."

When I came back, sobered up a little she was arrested. Charged with some heavy shit and I never saw or spoke to her again. 


I hope she's doing okay because she had so much potential. Still stoked I got away with those shrooms. 

P.S- I have another story that is so fucked up. Maybe for later.



EDIT 1: Typos. Sorry I'm tired.

EDIT 2: grammar 




 So unfortunate.  




 GLORIOUS!  




 Since there are 13 books (some of my favorite) how many seasons do you think it would be? 

To Beatrice- When we were together I felt breathless. Now you are. 




 This literally is what mine look like everyday in the summer. I don't go swimming or wear shorts it sucks.  




 LMAO HAHAHAHAHA my man is a vegan and he eats my carnist pussy all the damn time and loves it. 




 That show terrified me as a child.  




 BHOLE 




 That's a Doozer.  




 Hey /u/RandomguyDota like this?? 




 How does something like that fucking happen?! I'm washing my vagina right now... 




 I clicked........I will forever be disgusted with myself. 




 I have a great life now! I have been seeing my new guy for a year and he's amazing, no children, managing a top notch restaurant. Where I want and need to be. In a really good place. He's 40 now, single and working at Tire Man. (Me leaving forced him to get a job.) Last I heard he got pulled over for a DUI. So yeah...good riddance. 




 I left out that he is 37. But I agree. My mother was adopted and after meeting her biological mother...it was a good thing.  




 I love finding mistakes like thus in movies or shows. Makes me feel like "Hey! Even celebrities who are made out to be perfect sometimes can't get it right. So when I'm drunk and can't answer my phone correctly I don't feel bad about myself. "  




 Forgot something crucial for work. Came home during my lunch break to get it and my fiance and this girl were tangled in my sheets. I simply got what I needed and walked out of the house. He ran after me asking why I wasn't fighting for him. I asked him "Why would I fight for someone who isn't faithful?" And that was it. Moved back in with my parents the next day. 

P.S- He got her pregnant. She had a baby boy, and put the child up for adoption. She said having a kid would be a burden at 19.

  




 Cheers friend. Tomorrow is a new day 




 I live by lake Erie, so I literally have a lot to do. Cedar Point, Put-In-Bay, wineries, my cottage is 45 mins away in Michigan. So much shit..but I guess that all involves drinking HA!  




 Bummer! Sorry I hope I never have to repeat a day like this again.  




 Thanks! Pouring will proceed!  




 Me! Cheers from North West OHIO!  




 I've had a seriously strange day. Odd, sad, confusing and bizarre things have been happening to me. So now I'm drunk. Off orange vodka, soda. At the local dive bar. Cheers Reddit! Cheers Ohio!  




 This is actually the picture that brought me to Reddit three years ago. 


I know it says "one year', this is my second account. 




 In my city, Chinese are the worst drivers. 




 Elephants are elegant creatures. It makes me sick to think someone would do something like this. 
























 Mine were raised. Looked just like hers actually. My doctor said it was a remedy that could be used either way.  




 Is it common to find typos? I took a picture but I cannot submit it. (On Relay)  




 Not at all. I prefer it that way. My friends tend to bicker and that is a constant buzz kill. I like to do them in my basement and watch Netflix. Unless I'm with my boyfriend. Then we just do stupid shit and fuck for hours.  




 So I get this. Especially on my bikini line. My pediatrician told me two weeks ago, to go to the dollar store, buy the Athletes foot cream, whatever one they have, and baby powder. Apply after a shower. First the cream, then the powder. After a few days it goes away. And mine was worse than this. It also surprisingly got rid of the dark spots. Now, I'm not an expert and everyone's bodies reacts differently to things- so it is merely a remedy. I cannot promise anything but I hope that maybe it helps! 


EDIT: Make sure when you do apply these two easy steps, it is to dry skin. Try not to out on underwear right after. My suggestion would be after a shower before bed. Sleep commando.  




 MONKFISH 




 I am terrified of looking into the sky at any time of day/night. 




 Maleficent 




 Wait......... 




 I wouldn't punch you. Maybe just back hand ya. Or shake you. I can't decide. You look like my brother that's why....no hard feelings right?  




 Ohhhhh typical Temprance/Bedford behavior. Gotta love Michigan drivers. To people in Ohio, especially Toledo (bordered) Michigan drivers drive like someone lit them on fire. As ex dispatcher for NWO police majority of our accidents happen with Michigan drivers.

EDIT: I shouldn't say majority. But lots. Follow the traffic laws and all should be okay. Everyone rushes around here like traffic is that bad. Rush hour traffic in Toledo most you'd have to wait is an hour. Any where else- triple that.  




 Guilty. 




 Thank you! Lololll that is perfection 




 I need to meet these men. 




 I still think Jennifer Garner is a bitch for coming into the picture when he was with JLo. And I also still think that Afleck and JLo would be together to this day if it weren't for Garner. And we all know JLo is a ride or die kind of girl (Diddy shooting stint) so when it came to Aflecks friends (Kevin Smith) I doubt she would have objected to the friendship. She probably would have been the one handing him the Zippo for his smoke seshs anyways. Garner seems like an uptight bitch. Her little winced smile like the head of a dildo is going up her ass at all times. Idk there is something about Garner.... Something is off with her. 


End rant about people I don't know and will never meet. 




 What happened?  




 My cottage in southern Ohio was build on an old Amish farm. Our lake was created by a damn, it is about 6 miles long. All the houses are in the bays of the lake. So anyways..

I was in bed one night and a little girl with long blonde hair in a white baptismal gown appeared at the foot of my bed. My younger cousin was in the room with me. When I saw her I tried to scream but no sound was coming from me. I could feel my chest getting tense. Anyways, this little girl said to me "SWIM!" after she said that she looked as if she was suffocating. I was totally spooked. Did some research and asked a few neighbors after that night if they had experienced anything. Apparently this little Amish girl drown in the lake right after the water had settled and she went from house to house warning people to not go in. 

I embrace her now since she has such a sad story but truthfully....she still scared me a little.  




 I've always been pretty sensitive since I have been younger, honestly I know he is a good guy just territorial. 

I have always been pretty lax around my house and others, always keep things clean but I have a bad habit of leaving doors and things open, in the past he has shut them right in front of me. He's territorial and doesn't like things messed up. 

So I need to do a better job of respecting that. In the end I think he is just looking out.  




 So I'm house sitting again for my neighbors that I have previously posted about before. We did tell her father-in-law the day I arrived that I would be here and so far so good. A few subtle things like shutting doors, opening and shutting of drawers in the bed room. But nothing that has actually made me scared.

He was playing fetch with one of the dogs the other day. The dogs toy would move slowly around the room and the dog was chasing it. My mother actually witnessed this happening. She couldn't believe her eyes. 

Glad he's getting to be more comfortable around me.  




 FRANK. 




 Can we see full with like a semi? I'm just so curious.  




 I slept with my best friends step dad when I was 20. He was in my college town for business. Always was attracted to him. He would always randomly hand us $100 in high school and on vacations and shit.  He was handsome, wealthy and I never really thought of him as her 'father/step father'. It happened and it was amazing. When she found out, she laughed. Said I wasn't the only one who had thought about it. But I was the only one to do it. She wasn't upset. Still isn't. We see one another weekly. I guess I got off easy. I still see him randomly, but I am in an amazing happy relationship. 


EDIT: When I said "We see one another weekly." I mean my friend. Not him. I am in a great relationship.

 OMG THAT'S THE WORST! I'm so sorry that happened to you.  




 LONG LIVE TAYLOR SWIFT.









Was never a fan of hers until this album. CHEERS TAYLOR. 




 That's what I'm going to ask them to do. They leave in a few days and will be back in August will keep you posted!  




 From my understanding and the stories she and her husband have told me is that, he will turn on and off lights. When the kids are done playing in a room and forget to turn off a light, they would see them go off. Whenever any of their children wake up at night to use the restroom or get a glass of water, he will willingly turn on lights BEFORE they enter the room. Like he knows where they are going. 

He has never truly harmed me, just scared me a few times. I wonder what I did wrong to him because from what I am told he was a nice man. Just didn't like change. I plan on staying the whole month- because it is a vacation to me being out of my parents house. I work so much (in a restaurant so strange hours) that I leave the dogs home all day and they like the company so of course I will sleep there. 

I will just have to sit down and have a conversation with him. Let him know I mean no harm.

I live in Sylvania, OH. What some people fail to mention about this cemetery is that it is in a neighborhood.  My friends and I would smoke weed out in the cemetery every once in a while. This day in particular, we hadn't smoked yet and we heard a woman weeping. We decided not to smoke and investigate instead. 

About 30 minutes in we heard a woman weeping again. Then she asked "Where are they?!' We knew right then and there it was the woman looking for her husband's. We couldn't believe it. Needless to say we all ran like chickens. Couldn't believe what we had heard. It has been about 6 years and I can still hear the voice plain as day.  




 She has told me before that she always knew he was there but activity didn't start until they started making changes on the house. New floors, windows, ect. I don't mind that he is there, I just want him to be comfortable with me and my boyfriend.  




 They encourage me to have my boyfriend and certain friends over they don't mind at all! I've been house sitting for them for about 3 years now. I just feel as if he doesn't like me personally. I don't know. I want to sage the house but I would have to ask them before I did  




 So I house sit for my across the street neighbors once a month. Typically for a weekend sometimes a couple weeks. Great money. Watch the dogs and Ghost Adventures the whole time. Since my parents live across the street I feel safe. And since my neighbors have known me for so long I sometimes will have small get togethers with my friends or my significant other.

I have mentioned in other posts that I am somewhat sensitive. Normally things with spirits don't bother me much.


 Anyways...her father-in-law passed away in the house about 15 years ago. These are bigger houses, and if you are down stairs the only way someone upstairs could hear you is if you are extremely loud. Like making a point for someone to hear you.

So my S/O was really pissing me off this night in particular. He said he was coming over but got trashed instead. I kept telling him to get a cab and come over since I was lonely and quite honestly just wanted to cuddle. That's when it all happened...

 I was upstairs in the master bedroom watching television as I was falling asleep. About an hour after I fell asleep, I was sleeping on my right side, I felt someone push me onto my back and then pull the sheets off of the bed. I stayed as calm as possible. Went downstairs to let the dogs out and smoke a cigarette. When I got down there every light was on, the stove was on and the television was on. They have an amazing security system and I never worry about break ins. Plus my handy pistol is always by my side. 

I turned everything off, smoked my cigarette, got the dogs in,
 brushed my teeth and went back upstairs. About two hours later the same thing happened again. Pushed onto my back and the sheets were pulled off the bed. 

This time I heard a very loud bang. Shook the walls a little. I flew out of bed. At this point I knew someone was in the house fucking with me. I thought it was my man being drunk and stumbling around. But being me I grabbed my pistol and checked every room upstairs and carefully made my way down stairs. No one was in the house. Every light was on. Every cabinet was open. Stove was on. Television was on. The dogs were hiding in the laundry room. I called my man and he said he was still out and that he would be over soon. I stayed up and waited for him. 

When he arrived an hour later we went upstairs and laid down. He was holding me and all of a sudden his arm was yanked off. We both lost it. I have never been so terrified in my life. I called my neighbors and told them what happened. She told me to not worry about it that I was probably just her father-in-law. That he was never a fan of other people in his house and that I should talk to him and explain that I was there to take care of the animals and the house. Make sure everything was okay and safe while his son and daughter were out of town. 


I go back next week for a month while they go to their other home in California. I'm absolutely terrified to go back. 

How can I make this right with her late father-in-law?  




 Not yet lol
