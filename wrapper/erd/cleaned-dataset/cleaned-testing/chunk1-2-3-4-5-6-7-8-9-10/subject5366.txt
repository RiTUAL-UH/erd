 Sept. 24. Duncan's family members tell U.S. authorities this is the day he first felt sick. That is when he likely became contagious.  
 Sept. 26. Duncan seeks treatment at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas and is sent back to his sister's apartment with antibiotics.  
 Sept. 28. Duncan is transported to the same hospital by ambulance. He is critically ill and put in isolation in the hospital's intensive care unit.  
 Sept. 30. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirms that Duncan has been stricken with the Ebola virus, the first patient to be diagnosed in the USA.

 Ya, you do need to do your homework, consult a lawyer, know what to negotiate, etc.

 These debt collectors will settle for pennies on the dollar. Maybe a few more pennies than they paid for the loan, but they'll normally be willing to negotiate before going to get a judgement. 




 Nope you shouldn't have to, as part of their jobs though they will ask.

 It depends?  
Action combat can be fun, but it can also get repetitive, tiring, and boring as well. I suppose if combat is as dangerous as it sounds, you may not be fighting something/someone every few minutes during your gameplay, mitigating some of the cons.  
Personally I miss the pre-teamspeak days, where combat was slower,  you actually typed commands to your teammates, and allowed for more strategy rather than the current 'maximize button presses per minute, dodge when you see a swing' tactic to overcome your foes.

When they spend pretty much all of the [Landmark Live broadcast](http://www.twitch.tv/landmarkgame/v/3801401) trying to explain 'it's going to be ok', it's depressing. I've been through cuts like that, it takes time, like mourning a lost friend, to recover.

 I guess I'd respond with, sure bag/bank slots or costumes are great and all, but why spend time designing those items and then NOT give them in-game as recipes to help your crafting patrons.  
Stuff in cash shops like that usually just undermines social aspects, why ask a friend to craft you a larger bag when you can just plop down $5. And then it hits you, that had to be determined pretty early in the design doc's and you start to wonder if the devs really are making a game and not just a cash machine. I understand they need money to keep the lights on, but sometimes I just scratch my head at the things lost with pay-2-convenience.

 You won't be able to turn off automatic updates in Win10, all you'll be able to do is schedule restarts.  
You can't be trusted to keep your PC secure so they'll do it for you, check out the Win10 preview and the talks last week from Ignite conference. 




 Free forever!1@!!#1!!1  
Being free forever will undoubtedly allow for adware/spyware and other 'tracking' happening behind the scenes whether you care about it or ignore it.  
OneDrive, Skype, the Store, the Camera app, and a handful of other things are un-installable (disable only lol) permanent back-doors.  
Not to mention the forcing of auto-updates, can only pick what ring you want to be on slow/fast and when to schedule reboots. They don't trust anyone, including sysadmins, to get the patches out so they'll do it for you, ya know for 'security'.

 Not sure why you're downvoted, although to be fair Nintendo does own a majority share of Game Freak. Those other 2 pay-to-play games and the recent Mii Plaza changes on the 3DS ($5 to upgrade the plaza and $5 for each of the ~5 non-free games, that ALL rely on Streetpass) isn't a good sign.

 Really, they are bombing in their pre-launch alpha   beta phases now. After players get in and see the dull and lazy writing on the wall, they're gone (See TESO trying to entice its masses of beta-players to try live this weeked). They could care less about it 'only being alpha/beta', when we've seen time after time, promises of miracle patches and countless bugs reported but never fixed before launch, etc.

 That's what they had in one of their earlier iterations though, which was scrapped when they started on voxel-craft.  
Daybreak is caught in a generation gap, developing a followup to two games released over a decade ago, yet trying to stay relevant to gamers today. It's a tough balance to not piss off your veterans and also be interesting enough for newbies.  
In the end, I think when they tossed their lot in with voxels as the means for detail (not just the land masses, etc) they painted themselves into a technical corner. Still today if you get a claim or so away from anything really detailed in Landmark it becomes a melty mess. I know they keep saying their working on that but I think it's one of their achilles heals, with the other being AI.

 I know right, now you can't turn off updates at all, nor pick which updates you want. It's all or nothing baby... 




 It was through Windows Update, they pushed some updates a few months ago:

 Most home users aren't on a domain or have knowledge of group policies, but there is a "Prevent the usage of OneDrive for file storage" setting:  
You can use Group Policy Editor to modify the policies for specific services on your computer to disable OneDrive. 




 Since OneDrive is built into the operating system in Windows 8.1, you cannot uninstall it.  
Right, so the code still lives on in the system, and any new user created on the system will have it enabled for them. I'm sure that won't have an exploit /s 









 It is, but it's still obfuscated during setup.  
Also, most all of the embedded apps, including Cortana, will require a MS account to function.

 Well, yes,certain "apps" can't be uninstalled: onedrive, Skype, camera, maps, weather, etc. Apps that are deemed 'core' can't be, so that if a new user was created on the device they would be presented with the core apps, at a minimum, without having to download them.

 Here's another [breakdown](http://www.microsoft.com/investor/EarningsAndFinancials/Earnings/PressReleaseAndWebcast/FY15/Q3/default.aspx)  
It looks like Devices and Consumer Licensing is about a third of Commercial Licensing, which includes Windows VL. 




 They still rake in a tidy sum from licensing Windows, as this report from couple years ago shows http://www.tannerhelland.com/4993/microsoft-money-updated-2013/  
Not sure on the home vs business breakdown tho 




 Different? PC gamers, a majority of which run Windows, with games bought primarily ([~50%+ of digital distribution market share](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_%28software%29#Market_share_and_impact)) from Steam in the last decade, there's some overlap I think.

 Interesting that this comes after last weeks rumor about [MS ditching windows phone](http://www.techradar.com/us/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/microsoft-is-about-to-kill-windows-phone-claims-bold-new-rumour-1298038).  
Edit: also direct link  
["We plan to narrow our focus to three customer segments where we can make unique contributions and where we can differentiate through the combination of our hardware and software. Well bring business customers the best management, security and productivity experiences they need; value phone buyers the communications services they want; and Windows fans the flagship devices theyll love."](http://news.microsoft.com/2015/07/08/satya-nadella-email-to-employees-on-sharpening-business-focus/) 




 Cool, these are only about $30: Intel PRO/1000 PT Dual Port Server Adapter 




 The mb has dual Intel NICs on it would I still want more?      http://www.asrockrack.com/general/productdetail.asp?Model=E3C224D4I-14S#Specifications 




 Thanks! Yep, I'm thinking maybe using WD Red/Red Pro HDDs instead so that I can repurpose them for a proper NAS later on. 




 Hi all, I'm looking to build my first homelab server. I currently have a couple Raspberry Pi's that I have running ownCloud, OpenVPN,   nginx and I want learn how to scale up and possibly recreate my mini Pi-lab on bigger hardware.  
I have an NCASE M1 that I purchased a year ago that I'd like to use for this, hence the small ITX motherboard.  I wanted to start out building an all-in-one like I've seen from some others in this sub where I run ESXi as a host, and then test running VM's like Nas4free/FreeNas/Unraid, Windows 2012 R2, Sophos UTM/pfSense, Slackware,   Debian.   
Here's what I was thinking of:  
* CPU - Intel Xeon E3-1241V3  
* MB - ASRock E3C224D4I-14S  
* RAM - 32GB Crucial ECC 1600Mhz  
* HDD - 3 x WD Black 3TB drives  
* SSD - Intel S3610 400GB  
* PWR - Silverstone SX500-LG  
* FAN - Noctua NH-U9S  
  
Thanks, let me know if you have any suggestions!

 My personal comparison is between an update to Cube World or a Jolla/SailfishOS phone released in the US. 









 This is the page they'll be updating throughout the month. 



















 Someone should write up a list of customizations/options lost if updating from Win7 to Win10. 




 Who would've guessed that making broadband a utility would lead to politicians wanting a piece of the pie through some amusement tax. 




 I'd guess the FCC making broadband a utility opened up some loophole.

 Thanks FCC

 Broadband is a public utility now, net neutrality, get ready for more 'taxing' fun on anything going over the pipe.
