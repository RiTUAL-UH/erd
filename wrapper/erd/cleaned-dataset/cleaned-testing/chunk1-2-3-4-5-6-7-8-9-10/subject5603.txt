 I will say this for Rand Paul, he's the most entertainingly unpredictable figure in politics today.  One moment he's challenging Obama on [drones](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/05/rand-paul-calls-for-public-release-of-extrajudicial-killing-memos/362058/), next he's [calling out the GOP on voter id](http://www.politico.com/story/2014/05/rand-paul-gop-voter-id-106543.html) and then he's telling an implausible lie about the [ACA](http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/rand-pauls-latest-aca-whopper).  Most politicians (or people for that matter) you already know what they're going to say on any subject, but I'll give Rand Paul his due for keeping us guessing. 




 But there's still time for another resolution to repeal it.  Come on House of Representatives!  Make your opinion known. 




 It is ludicrous isn't it?  George Will complains that the scientists are corrupted by Federal Funding and never mentions that some of the climate change deniers might just have a financial interest in their point of view. 




 Sure, but let's also remember that the OWS was a genuine grass roots movement, not an astroturf outside funded movement like the Tea Party.  I'm inclined to think social movements often sputter out a couple of times before they catch fire.  It's not like civil rights movement began the day Rosa Parks decided not to give up her seat on the bus.  If OWS turns out to be a only catalyst, that might be all America is ready for.  I remain optimistic, although I'll admit in part because I can't stand to think of my kids growing up in the world the right wing wants to create. 




 Well, he's certainly got the [sucking ass to the base](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/11/rubio-climate-change_n_5305082.html) part down. 




 I wouldn't dismiss OWS so flippantly.  Income inequality was not part of the mainstream conversation before their protests.  Maybe we haven't seen much in results yet, but  the issue isn't readily dismissed anymore. 




 Can we all just agree that George Will is a tedious old git and ignore him? 




 Wonder why they limit themselves to criticizing scientists who work in climate change and evolution?  Why not also dispute the findings in particle physics and entomology? 




 Just red meat for the base.  




 Maybe not, but they can do a lot of damage while trying. 




 Even so, 97% of climate scientists agree that the burning of fossil fuels is the primary driver of the warming observed in recent decades. Should policy really be based on the minuscule chance that they're wrong?

Nice to see USA Today writing an editorial like this, but why did it take this long for their editorial board to acknowledge the obvious? 




 Anytime anyone says anything is 'eminently fair', they know it isn't. 




 We've been down this route before.  The Supreme Court was quite partisan in the decade leading up to the civil war.  Still, I can't help but worry that we'll never make it back to a more co-operative politics.  




 As he observes, the most radical pro-ALEC governor is Walker, whose tax-cutting and anti-union zeal has propelled him into the race for the GOP Presidential nomination for 2016. His state's economic performance has been dismal, as ALEC's own figures show. Walker predicted that his policies would result in job growth of 250,000; so far he's fallen short by more than 94,000. 

And if that's not enough.

What's worst about these ALEC policies, Chinn reports, is that the relentless budget-cutting they require leave crucial state services, particularly education, gasping for breath. That's a formula for long-term decline, not growth.

The Republican party, mean-spirited and short sighted.
 




 You'd think all these Bible loving conservatives would knoq that privatizing tax collections is a [bad idea](http://ancientroadpublications.com/Studies/BiblicalStudies/TaxCollectors.html). 




 If I had the money, I'd put up a billboard in Waukesha (one of Wisconsin's Republican strongholds) that reads something like.  'Scott Walker has received $47 million from outside interests.  Is he giving them their money's worth?'  or 'Scott Walker has received $47 million dollars from interests outside the state.  And you think he's working for you?'  I am puzzled why the Wisconsin Democrats (or Democrats anywhere for that matter) don't make an issue of how beholden Republican politicians are to their sponsors.  Bought and paid for. 
 




 It's it makes no sense, there's a good chance it's the Republican position. Works for most issues. 




 Rand Paul - boldly challenging the facts! 




 So does this mean if you watch [Fox News] (http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/john-farrell/2010/12/22/university-study-fox-viewers-more-misinformed) you shouldn't vote? 




 Not to mention the rest of *Lola vs. Powerman* or *Something Else*.  And they were one of the inventors of power pop.  




 No, I'm talking about the person who downvoted chaim-the-eez for agreeing with you.   




 Don't let one person's idiocy get you down.  




 If you want to read a refutation of this article, read the New York Times article it [links to](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/26/business/economy/making-sense-of-income-inequality.html?_r=1).  Especially the last few paragraphs. 

One of the plausible consequences of rising inequality is that it allows the 1 percent to take control of the political system, purchasing the power needed to maintain the status quo. If that is the case  and there is plenty of suggestive evidence of this  the widening of the income gap would prove irreversible. Mr. Jencks describes the state of the debate between friends and foes of inequality in these terms: Can I prove that anything is terrible because of rising inequality? Not by the kind of standards I would require. But can they prove I shouldnt worry? They cant do that either. That, alone, is enough to spur action. Something that looks bad is coming at you, he said. Saying that we shouldnt do anything about it until we know for sure would be a bad response.

That last statement is also a pretty good argument for starting to make the adjustments needed for climate change, starting now. 




 Unfortunately, it appears that 'Use it or lose it' is starting to apply to voting. 




 The question isnt whether the federal government should help; the question is how, Mr. Ryan said at the hearing on Wednesday. How do we make sure that every single taxpayer dollar we spend to reduce poverty is actually working?

Do you thing Paul Ryan is equally concerned that 'every dollar' spent on the military or every trickle-down special tax break on investments is 'actually working'? 









 As dismaying as the prospect of Sarah Palin as Vice President was,  I sometimes think having Paul Ryan next in line for the Presidency was even more frightening. 




 If you were determined to cast an invalid vote, it would probably be fairly easy to do. But it [simply doesn't happen very often](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/OTUS/voter-fraud-real-rare/story?id=17213376). Not really much personal advantage to it, and the penalties are harsh. 




 For all the population, the average is 11%, but in certain sub-groups, the percentage will be higher or lower.  




 Studies show that as many as 11 percent of eligible voters do not have government-issued photo ID. That percentage is even higher for seniors, people of color, people with disabilities, low-income voters, and students. Many citizens find it hard to get government photo IDs, because the underlying documentation like birth certificates (the ID one needs to get ID) is often difficult or expensive to come by. At the same time, voter ID policies are far more costly to implement than many assume. Instead, Improvements in voting technology and modernization of our voter registration system will both increase efficiency and close the door on mistakes and fraud.

 I've always thought Paul Ryan was easy to understand, if you know one fact about him and remember one maxim.
Fact) Paul Ryan was voted biggest brown-noser by his high school classmates. 
Maxim) Character reveals itself early. 




 His big job in politics is to write budgets. And his big budget idea is that rich people should pay lower taxes, middle class and working class people should pay more taxes, and poor people should get less food, medicine, and college tuition.

But if he stands around some poor people with a concerned frown on his face, maybe no one will notice what his budget says. 




 Or don't even bother to read his budget. Paul Ryan's ideas are easy to understand : Government money spent on poor people - Bad.  Lower taxes on the wealthy - Good.   




 And where does the author back up his claim that the "worst Actors were in the White House, not on Wall Street."?  He lists all the things the Clinton White House did that he doesn't like, but nowhere discusses the  actions of Wall Street and why Clinton's actions were worse. If someone were to tell you that Fords are not as reliable a car as a Volkswagen, and only listed the problems with Fords, would you consider that argument convincing?  




 Kind of slow on the uptake there, aren't you Top Republicans? 




 How would the existence of a properly priced subprime market have caused a crash? 




 Newly released memos from the Clinton presidential library reveal evidence the government had a big hand in the housing crisis. **The worst actors were in the White House, not on Wall Street.**

 




 Let's also blame Clinton for the rating services giving triple AAA ratings to housing backed securities, Greenspan's mistakes, and for the rampant dishonesty among bankers.  Might as well pin everything on him. 




 I'm a whole lot more concerned about the boys like Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, and Paul Ryan.  These [naughty boys](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/rep-lowey-calls-paul-ryan-naughty-boy) are driving the Republican agenda, but appear to have the emotional maturity of adolescents.   Even the [National Review](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/375765/rand-pauls-foreign-policy-situation-room-or-dorm-room-rich-lowry) and [Right Turn](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2013/04/29/dont-be-a-jerk-sen-cruz/) find these 'gentleman' lacking. And Ryan seems to missed some basic rules in his upbringing, [about telling the truth](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/post/paul-ryans-dishonest-speech/2012/08/30/16bb62d8-f24f-11e1-adc6-87dfa8eff430_blog.html). 





























 [Empire of Liberty](http://www.amazon.com/Empire-Liberty-History-Republic-1789-1815/dp/0199832463) is my choice.   Misinformation about the Founding Fathers intents and America's early years are used to justify all brands of nonsense.  It would be harder to get away with if we all had a basic understanding of our history. Well written book too.

And I missed a word in the title 'If you **could** require...' 



























































































































































































































































































































































































 The justifications are different, but the goal is always the same, concentrating wealth and power at the top.  




 Excellent, Now if we just figure out how to bring in 'Fast and Furious' and Solyandra into the picture, and convince ourselves everything is  part of a United Nations plot to take away our guns, we'll have a Unified Obama conspiracy theory going. 




 Twist: They're even more scandalous! 









 Adults admit when they've made a mistake, children try to blame someone else.  




 I don't have any particular insights into what went on at the IRS, but it certainly doesn't pass the smell test.  What I object to is someone as dishonest as Ryan grandstanding over anyone else's veracity.   




 The congressman with 21 statements rated False, Mostly False and Pants on Fire by [Politifact](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/paul-ryan/) and earned 13 Pinocchios from the [WP FactChecker](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/paul-ryan-added-to-the-pinocchio-tracker/2012/08/26/eb76222c-ef95-11e1-adc6-87dfa8eff430_blog.html ) when he was running for Vice President is accusing someone else of lying.  Maybe the IRS officials are lying, maybe they aren't but Ryan has no standing to accuse anyone else of dishonesty.  




 Do you think Fox published a similar list about the Bush-Cheney administration 8 years ago.  A list that includes  9/11, resistance in Iraq, lack of readiness for Katrina, economic meltdown in 2008? I'm guessing not. 




 His reputation seems to have [held up](http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/209438-poll-bill-clinton-most-admired-recent-president ). 




 I don't know if I agree. Michelle Bachmann was threatening to corral it for a while.  Not to mention Rick Perry and Herman Cain. There's lots of competition in the GOP for the gullible, small brained voter. 




 Appears that Huckabee is making a play for the imbecile vote.
 




 Somehow, I have a feeling that George Will is already writing a column praising Dick Cheney's latest venture.  




 Unfortunately,  he didn't do so well with domestic issues which cost him his re-election. Great foreign affairs President though.  




 Absolutely on the money. Germany has [higher labor costs](http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/06/17/german-labor-costs/) than the US, but manages to compete successfully in the world economy.

 GHWB was a mixed bag, but he deserves full props for managing the international situation during the disintegration of the Soviet Union.  That could have been a nightmare (the news from Iraq provides one possibility), but he managed to keep US - Russian relations on an even keel.

 Sounds pretty close to the qualifications George W. Bush brought to the office. The record of businessmen in the Presidency is [unimpressive](http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2012/02/17/sorry-mitt-romney-good-businessmen-rarely-make-good-presidents).  




 War and politics are inextricably linked, especially in a democracy.  A democracy can only fight a long war with the consent of the citizens.  And if you want to see an example of the civilian President knowing how to fight the war better than the military expert, read about Lincoln and McClellan.  




 You know who was a really successful businessman?  Herbert Hoover.  Success in one field doesn't always translate into political skill.  A politician needs to be a different kind of leader than a business executive.  




 Poor Eric.  Maybe the House can have another vote to repeal Obamacare.  That always seems to make him feel better. 




 Franklin Roosevelt bent a few rules getting the US ready for WWII, especially in aiding Britain and the USSR while the US was still neutral.  I don't think history has accused him of trampling democracy.  Probably saved it.

 Sure they're serious, but as the article concludes:

But reform conservatism must still prove itself to be more than a slogan, more than a marketing campaign, more than that new pizza box. The Reformicons can be part of the historic correction the conservative movement badly needsor they can settle for being sophisticated enablers of more of the same.

Right now reformers have no meaningful influence in the Republican Party.

 Around 1 out of 13 voters showed up in Texas, and our first lesson is that strange things happen when you hold an election and nobody comes. You can, for instance, wind up with a hard-right nominee for attorney general who violated state securities regulations and then excused himself by pointing out that the law was very complicated.
 









 I feel that a concentration of power in anyone's hands is a danger to us all. At the moment the biggest issue is the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of few outside government is a far bigger threat. At another time it might be the government.  Do you think Wall Street loves you better than the government?  




 I halfway agree with you.  The Republican Party is the only thing that manages to make the Democrats look good. 




 Opinions are so much more convincing when they're capitalized and in bold, aren't they?  Not to mention that it saves a lot of valuable time that you'd need to waste looking up sources or constructing an argument. 




 Well, it's hard to dispute logic and sourcing like that.  Also spelling. 




 The public is clearly with Republicans in opposing the law in its current form, and that's why the GOP's broad opposition is likely to continue. Republicans don't need to weaken their opposition to Obamacare**they need to find something they would like to do instead**.

I love these articles. The authors never seem to pick up that the Republicans **never find something they would like to do instead**. Or rather they always want to do the same thing instead, which is lower taxes on the wealthy.

Grammar edit 




 Considering Bush left him two wars, an economy in shambles and a civilization threatening climate problem (Sorry,but I think scientists usually know what they're talking about) , and he had to deal with a Senate that set the record for filibusters and a House that came close to causing a default on the national debt because it wanted to pitch a tantrum about the ACA, I'd say he's done all right.  Of course Dick Cheney is still eligible to run for President, if you'd like a repeat of the Bush administration. 




 He should start campaigning as 'A Politician with Flexible Principles'.   




 And he's having an affair with [Beyonce](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant ion=1 espv=2 es_th=1 ie=UTF-8#q=obama%20rumors%20affair).  And he's [gay](http://www.wnd.com/2012/09/claim-obama-hid-gay-life-to-become-president/).  At the same time!

We can around and around pointing out our favorite hypocrisy on the other side, but it won't change anything.

Although some gun-rights advocates talk as though gun control were a modern, 20th-century invention of an increasingly meddlesome government, the historical passages in Gunfight suggest otherwise. Not only did the nations founders balance gun rights with public safety needs, Mr. Winkler says, but the wild, wild west wasnt all that wild. According to the research of one scholar he cites, almost everyone carried firearms in the untamed wilderness, which was full of dangerous American Indians, outlaws and bears, but in the towns where people lived and businesses operated, there were often blanket ordinances against the carrying of arms by anyone. One of the towns with strict rules was the notorious Dodge City, Kan.

 I've been wondering about this for some time, and Igbo provide another data point.  Are there any societies that 1) place a premium on education and 2) haven't been successful economically?

(Jimmy Page tried to dismiss it an homage to Sonny Boy, and claimed it was 'only a few seconds of music'.)

 I believe the study you cited (from the Cato Institute) is what we usually call [B.S.](http://www.businessinsider.com/does-welfare-really-pay-better-than-work-2013-8).  Do you think we'd have a 15% to 20% poverty rate if welfare paid that well?

Edit: Parenthetical remark added 
























 Despite the conflicting nature of these left and right analyses, there is a strong case to be made that they are, in fact, complementary and that they reinforce each other. What if we put it together this way? Automation, foreign competition and outsourcing lead to a decline in well-paying manufacturing jobs, which, in turn, leads to higher levels of unemployment and diminished upward mobility, which then leads to fewer marriages, a rise in the proportion of nonmarital births, increased withdrawal from the labor force, impermanent cohabitation and a consequent increase in dependence on government support. The major roadblock to synthesizing competing explanations has been  and continues to be  political polarization. Vested interests on the left and right have delayed, and in some cases prevented, recognition of the overlap between liberal and conservative hypotheses, and have pointedly ignored evidence that contradicts their preconceived partisan positions.

 True, but's it's so amusing. I particularly enjoy this part. 

Ryan professed not to know the price of the wine, and one of his buddies responded to Feinberg's chastisement by loudly saying, "Fuck her," Feinberg told TPM.

Maybe one day Texas will catch up with New Jersey.  which has somehow, with high taxes and without the enormous natural resources Texas has,  managed to have a higher income and a lower poverty rate. Oh  and why have property values held steady in Texas?  Funny thing, a [legal restriction](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/03/AR2010040304983.html), played a big role in that.  




 That's why, no matter what the problem, Republicans insist that government is not the solution; tax cuts for the wealthy are. There's only one hitch: none of this is really true.

But that's no reason not to believe it.

 There might be some other writers at the National Review who are thoughtful on race relations, but I doubt these ideas are widely held among conservatives.  If you put the above quote in front of the voters who selected Mitt Romney, what percentage do you think would agree with it? 




 The fourth view, closest to my own, is that the problem is fundamentally one of economics and economic history: Having been formally shut out of much of the economy until within recent memory, African Americans simply lag behind the average. The relatively fast economic advancement of other minority groups, such as Vietnamese immigrants, does not negate that premise: The history and position of black Americans is fundamentally different from that of immigrant groups. American institutions expended a great deal of effort to help assimilate and advance Vietnamese refugees, while many of those institutions had spent a solid century after the Civil War working to prevent the assimilation and advancement of African Americans.

I'm rather surprised to see a paragraph like this in the National Review.  I wonder how many of Williamson's fellow conservatives agree with it. Not many, I'd think. 




 Not to mention the economic system.

 I would imagine the conservative country would become a low tax, low public service and low wage economy.  A large percentage of the population would  have few opportunities and no meaningful civil rights, there would be  a relatively small middle class, and with most of the wealth concentrated in a few hands. Sort of like the South until the 1970's.  The liberal side likely evolve into a society more like Canada or Northern European states.   In international affairs, I would expect the conservative nation to be isolationist or belligerent and xenophobic, or more likely alternate between the two.

 Deut. 15:7. If there is a poor man among you, one of your brothers, in any of the towns of the land which the LORD your God is giving you, you shall not harden your heart, nor close your hand to your poor brother; but you shall freely open your hand to him, and generously lend him sufficient for his need in whatever he lacks.

Good idea, and I hope all his Republican colleagues read this verse.

 As John Stuart Mill, the British political economist, argued, people should be free to do as they please, provided they dont cause undue harm to others. But greenhouse gases have already caused great harm and threaten much worse. Mills cost-benefit framework provides no reason for thinking that someones freedom to escape the small burden of CO2 taxation should trump other, vastly more important freedoms. To the contrary, he said, restrictions on individual liberty are needed when the health and safety of the great mass of people and the purity of the natural environment are at stake.

It makes good economic sense to be a climate change denier if you're a heavy CO2 user or producer. If you argue that the problem doesn't exist, you can't be harming anyone else, and you don't need to pay to clean up your messes.

 Did anyone else notice that Ryan's report on poverty fails to mention that wages for low income American's have fallen dramatically over the last few decades?  The single biggest cause of poverty is essentially ignored. Honestly, you'd need an entire team of Clydesdales to come up with this much horseshit. 




 1) Renewables are more expensive now, but we've really only started to put research and money into them.  I remember a time when cell phones were much more expensive than land lines and had very limited coverage.  The relative cost of technologies can change rapidly.
2) Natural gas would be a good bridge if we're serious about reducing the methane leaks when extracting it.  Otherwise methane is serious contributor to warming as well.  




 It's not just Republican governors who you should be worried about.  There's plenty of manipulating government grants for political purposes at the local level. Do you think the Chicago Democrats would keep their hands clean when there's a big pile of block grant money in front of them? Corruption doesn't really track party lines. 




 Take a look at the [proposal](http://budget.house.gov/uploadedfiles/expanding_opportunity_in_america.pdf).  .  Do you see any discussion about the change in [ income distribution] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_income_in_the_United_States )   in the United States over the last 50 years? I can't. The biggest driver of poverty in the United States is an economic system that is concentrating wealth at the top.  Anyone who discusses poverty in the US and leaves this out is not interested in having an honest discussion. 




 Fair enough, but then the utilities need say that.  Structure a base rate with a minimum number of kilowatt hours included, and charge that amount for the monthly connection.  They could then structure rebates and further charges against that amount.

 I wasn't commenting on the on the proposal, but on Ryan's veracity. It seems to me that people who I've found to be dishonest tend to stay dishonest (and I don't care if you're talking about finance , romance or politics), and you should look at any proposal from such people skeptically. Perhaps you've had better experiences with reformed prevaricators than I have.    But turning to the proposal itself, I'm surprised by how much there is to like in it. Lower incarceration rates and increasing the EIC for childless adults, if it were any Republican but Paul Ryan suggesting this, he'd be getting jumped on for having become a squishy moderate.  There are also a number of dubious ideas, such as replacing programs with block grants to local governments.  I would imagine that places like Minnesota and Nebraska we'd see well run programs with impartial administrators, and in places like Chicago and Louisiana you'll see the grants abused for political favoritism, if not actually stolen.  There's also one genuinely laughable idea, life coaches.  We've had 'life coaches' for the poor since Jane Adams' Hull House, except for they're called social workers.  Relabeling them life coaches isn't going to make it any easier to transform people's lives. But here's the real problem with Ryan's plan.  Do you see any discussion about the change in [ income distribution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_income_in_the_United_States )   in the United States over the last 50 years?  In fact, hit crtl-F, type in distribution and see how many times and where the word turns up.    How can you claim to be discussing 'Opportunity in America' and how government programs have failed  to end poverty and ignore the fact that the income of the lowest quintile has fallen so greatly compared to everyone else?  Perhaps the problem isn't really the personal pathologies among the poor, or the ineffectiveness of government programs, but a increasingly unfair economic system.  I suspect that Ryan doesn't want that discussion started, so he's hiding the ball here. Its just his latest in his long line of distortions ,dissemblings and dishonesties.  




 Ryan does have a habit of telling ["stretchers"](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/fact-checking-6-claims-in-paul-ryans-convention-speech/6/).  




 I think that's a good move. US has been giving away its resources as ludicrously low prices for centuries.  If we're having an oil and gas boom without selling government resources, why put them on the market now?  And I would think our free market friends don't want the government competing with private industry to sell mineral rights. 




 Oil companies are upset that Obama isn't leasing Federal Lands at give away rates.

 Well. since they're far from the coast, I guess they think the sea level rise and flooding won't reach them ,,, Although if I were in the coal industry, I think I'd want to support politicians who were working on new cleaner technologies.

 House Budget Chair Paul Ryans "new" plan picks on poor children and families while not asking for one cent of sacrifice from rich corporations and rich individuals

If Paul Ryan was running an honest campaign, his slogan would be "He'll never ask the billionaires or bankers to sacrifice."  

Excellent comment.  You should send it to [Amar Kaleka](http://www.votekaleka.org/).  




 But where Ryan and others get it wrong is in their pervasive assumption that all you have to do to get a job is want a job. In this regard, here is what you need to know about work requirements: in the absence of strong labor demand, such requirements are a recipe for more, not less, poverty.

Why is it so hard to understand?  Do conservatives think the unemployment rate went from 4.7% in January 2006 to 9.7% in January 2011 because Americans became lazier and less willing to work over those 5 years?

At the moment, his prediction on the Senate is "Bottom line, Democrats have a 55% chance of control in an election held today. That is as close to a toss-up as it gets. " 




 So were these increases in homicides made up entirely of justified homicides allowed under the new laws? Both studies were inconclusive, but the authors seemed doubtful.

 Maybe I didn't say it clearly. In the example the poorer man still has the same income $10, but the richer's man income has nearly doubled $190.  
But that's just a hypothetical example. 




 But that's not how its working.  The wages and incomes of the lower 70% (or so depending on whose numbers you use ) have remained relatively flat for decades, while the incomes of the richest have grown dramatically.  In your example it would be more like the total wealth has grown to 200 , and the rich man is getting $190.  
And honestly do you really think the left 'the left would rather everyone made $15 instead, less for everyone but at least we're equal'.  Why would you think making caricatures out of other peoples opinions is  convincing anyone?

 Parental expectations and involvement are the most important ingredient to success in school. (I knew someone whose father was a  massive steelworker who was determined that his children would do well.  She told me there was never any question about doing homework in her house.)  But the isolation of inner city students has a big role in the failure rate and making the schools dysfunctional. I live in a smaller city, not big enough for us to have segregated ourselves too much economically, and all four of our high schools have a significant population of students from impoverished families. (At my kids high school there are students from both the wealthiest part of town and from a couple of rather grim housing projects. ) While the schools have their issues, all of them are reasonably successful and manage to serve economically diverse populations. But that kind of high school has disappeared in most larger urban areas.  Instead we have some schools that serve almost exclusively impoverished students, which clearly has a multiplier effect on the difficulties and discipline issues.  




 I'd agree with some of your statement. Building a nice high school building might make it easier to learn, but it doesn't guarantee successful outcomes.  And unfortunately, far too many lower income families don't understand the need to take schooling seriously. 
But ,
1) High school is too late. Student are far better off going to good elementary schools and a lesser quality high school. What a student brings to high school matters more than the school itself.
2) Isolating the poorer students tends to reinforce the social problems. Of course you're going to see more gang activities in one high school if it's the only school attended by kids who tend to get caught up in gangs. If the staff needs to spend a lot of time on disciplinary and violence issues, there's that much less time and resources for teaching, and more disruption. Students who are not disruptive themselves wind up with less education, through no fault of their own. 
3) The quality of the staff probably matters more than the building.  I know in my town we had one elementary school that was barely functional, until they replaced the principal.  The place still has it's issues, but it's a whole lot better.

 When you include all the taxes (Federal local and state) we all pay, US taxes are not particularly progressive. In fact the top !% play less taxes that the 80-99%.

 And when only the wealthy have political rights, the government will only serve their interests. Perfect, no? 




 Yes, because, correctly or incorrectly, they address the subject.  Cato faults the government in dealing with poverty, while ignoring the issue of falling wages and increased inequality.  You can't have a serious discussion about poverty over the last 30 years and leave out those changes. 




 I love these articles by conservative think tanks.

 Look no further than Republican attempts across the country to disenfranchise voters and suppress Democratic efforts to register and organize black and brown voters. The fact that the party of organized money thinks the right to vote is worth taking away says that it must be worth quite a lot.

 









 A college major in a subject isn't the professional qualification.  




 They're not economists either, but they somehow seem to all have ready opinions about how to improve the economy.  




 In 2012, Gov. Brownback called his states tax cuts a real live experiment in how tax-cutting affects the budget and the economy. So far, the main result of the experiment seems to be that cutting taxes causes the government to lose revenue.

Let's not rush to judgement. The experiment needs more time before it fails completely.

 Although I'm inclined to agree with you, there's some debate about the net effect of illegal labor.  But I've always thought if someone was really interested in ending illegal immigration, they'd crack down on employers as well, which I don't see any Republicans advocating.  What they're doing about illegal immigration is like fighting drug addictions by arresting the addicts and letting the sellers go free.

 Republicans are often perceived as indifferent to working-class struggles (because they sometimes are).

I think he's going easy on the Republicans here. I can't recall anything they've done recently to address working class struggles. Even Rich Lowry (the editor of the National Review) says Republicans aren't addressing middle class issues.    




 Well ,it was a long time ago when I went to the University of Illinois, but I think the ID cards said whether you were a state resident. I haven't heard of any cases of the scenario you describe.  If they had, I'm sure the voter ID advocates would be publicizing them. 




 Ruth Ginsburg, in her dissent on the supreme Court decision,  has a different view about Texas IDs.

Texas will not accept several forms of photo ID permitted under the Wisconsin law the Court considered last week. For example, Wisconsins law permits a photo ID from an in- state four-year college and one from a federally recognized Indian tribe. Texas, under Senate Bill 14, accepts neither. Nor will Texas accept photo ID cards issued by the U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Those who lack the approved forms of identification may obtain an election identification certificate from the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS), but more than 400,000 eligible voters face round-trip travel times of three hours or more to the nearest DPS office.Moreover, applicants for an election identification certificate ordinarily must present a certified birth certificate [which] can be obtained only at significant costat least $22 for a standard certificate sent by mail.

 




 1) If the legislators pushing voter ID were truly worried about voter fraud, they would make provisions so every voter had an ID. When you have laws in Texas that make a gun ID valid for voting (more often owned by conservatives) and a student ID not valid (a group that tends to vote more liberal), it strains credulity to think it's only about voter fraud.
2) In person voter fraud is insignificant, less that a rounding error. I'd be far more concerned about who counts the votes.

 I think some do care, but you're largely correct. I don't think Karl Rove spends a lot of time pondering his personal relationship with Jesus Christ. 




 Let's also send everyone a photo id for voting when they turn 18.  Would solve a problem that some people don't really want solved. 




 I've always thought the best indicator emotional maturity was the ability to take responsibility for one's failures and successes.  Which would put Brownback (and our dear, dear Scott Walker here in Wisconsin) at the maturity level of a middle schooler 




 Do you really think we could do better with the Repubs against any change?

A question I would like see posted every time someone complains that 'the two parties are the same' or 'Obama hasn't done enough'. 




 You're incorrectly assuming Republicans want to fix America's problem. Looking at the legislation they've passed over the last 3 decades,  they want a country that serves the interests of a tiny wealthy minority, and impose an evangelical morality on the rest of the population. 




 The magazine did endorse George W. Bush for President. And Bob Dole. And in economics it almost always endorses free trade and lesser regulation. (Though not in this article.)  I was trying to contrast it with the other sources, but I  overstated it. Probably should have left it at centrist.  




 Here's another article favoring minimum wage increases, from a more centrist (if not right leaning) publication.

Nice work Sam. It's truly difficult to distinguish yourself among this strong  competition.

 Yeah, but that was before he realized what a sweet deal being a Senator is.

Modern technology allows Ryan to accost an entire nation with his lunacies. 




 I'd put my money on Hillary against the Republican field, but I would never say it just can't happen.  Republicans are improving their ground game and, in the states you mentioned, are doing a pretty good job at voter suppression  




 This article is genuinely hilarious. Republicans score an average of .7 more correct answers in a news poll (about a 6% difference) , and the author is wetting himself because that proves Republicans are better informed than Democrats. And do you notice the article doesn't link to survey?  Wouldn't want people checking the survey for themselves, would you?  




 There's no better investment in Wisconsin than buying a piece of Scott Walker. 




 Because he might be President in 2016. 




 "I don't know the answer to that question," Ryan said. "I don't think science does, either."

This quote from a man who accepts inane economic theories that serve his agenda as fact. 




 I suppose I hardly need point out that Scott Walker is in favor of school vouchers. 









 If you want an example of dissembling and misleading through selective use of the material, you could hardly do better than this article.  Go to the actual [Pew survey](http://www.people-press.org/2014/10/02/from-isis-to-unemployment-what-do-americans-know/2/) (which oddly enough, the author somehow overlooked providing a link to), and see if you think the writer is giving a fair representation of the survey.

 If a nation reduce worker's bargaining power by eviscerating unions, ignores  wage theft, allows inflation to erode the minimum wage, taxes investment income less than wage income , and reduces the tax rates on the highest incomes, it's made political choices that effect the economy.

 Productivity per worker has greatly increased over the last few decades, profits are high, but wages have been stagnant. If the money was going to increased wages instead of profits, you wouldn't be posing this question.  There's no iron economic law driving the concentration of wealth at the top. It's a political choice.  




 The biggest problem is the concentration of wealth at the top.  Start electing legislators who see that as a problem, instead of something to abet.

 Education is only mandatory through 16 in most places, but every state I know of provides free education through 18 (or completing high school.)  It's generally held that it's in society's interest to provide education beyond the age when you can drop out of school, and as the world demands more skills, I would argue that extending that further would be in our best interest. 
If Walker is saying that public investments will pay for themselves, like helping finance a public stadium, it seems  that education returns the investment several times over.  Look at the relative incomes of places like Mass or NJ , which spend many on education, vs Mississippi or Alabama, which skimp on it. (Funding public education is really one the oldest debates in US History. Places like New England have always favored spending heavily, the southern states have always opposed it.
I don't know the details of the endowments, but places like UW Madison are also (research centers)[http://www.warf.org/about-us/background/history/history.cmsx ] At least in Wisconsin, it looks like there is a pretty good return on the money.

 Please, please, please. 




 A weakened IRS is yet another way to push income taxes down.  If business owners and investors are routinely able to understate their income with little chance of an audit, their effective tax rate falls. Income earned through wages is harder to hide, leaving them taxed on their true income. Why the Democrats never make an issue of how Republican anti-IRS policies enable tax cheaters, I can't understand.

 If that were the typical conservative response, I would have less of a problem with it.  But usually they claim to be champions of free enterprise, but find a reason for an exception for themselves or a favored group.  (Paul Ryan on the bank bailouts is a particularly egregious example of this.)  And when something they don't like gets a subsidy, say alternative energy, they throw a fit about favoritism and crony capitalism.  (And I realize I'm generalizing. I'm aware that there are reasonable ,thoughtful and unhypocritical conservatives.  But you can hardly hear them because the Rush Limbaugh , Fox News etc conservatives have taken all the air.) 




 Just look at what has been the first order of business for Republicans after they won full control of Congress for the first time in eight years this past fall. Its not expanding the earned income tax credit, but rather pushing a Wall Street wish list for tweaks to weaken the Dodd-Frank financial reform law of 2010.

Somehow, I'm not wholly convinced of Ryan, Romney, etc's newly found concern for poverty and the middle class. 









 But that's different ... because conservatives always claim their government handouts are 'different'. 




 To think Wisconsin used to be known for clean government ... Scott Walker has sure turned that around. 




 Still, I don't think it's fair to call these 49 Senators anti-science. I'll bet everyone of them believes in gravity.

 Low wages are not structural, they are not inevitable  they are choices, Tom Perez, Obamas Labor Secretary, said at an AFL-CIO event last week.

If every populist, liberal or conservative, understands this, we'll start seeing real changes.  




 It seems to me that Obama has had at least as much 'real' job experience as Paul Ryan, the Chairman of the House Ways and Means , who is the Republican's leader on tax policy.  Check out [Ryan's job history] (http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/a-look-at-paul-ryans-career-on6eh4g-165824706.html).  The one job he's had that isn't in government or politics?  He was a 'consultant' to Ryan Inc. 




 Every time liberals propose something that improves wage earners situations, the right wing press and politicians always argue that it will  reduce the number of jobs available or reduce their wages.   









 While wages and incomes have stagnated in the United States (as well as in Japan and large parts of Europe), they have not done so everywhere. In Canada, a broad measure of incomes has risen about 10 percent since 2000, even as its fallen here. In Australia, its up 30 percent  .... What are Canada and Australia doing differently? For starters, they are doing a better job with mass education. They have near-universal preschool, and they both do more to get low-income students through college. In Australia, college is free. Increasingly, the report says, a college education is similar to the high school education of the past  necessary for a prosperous life.The efforts to create a more skilled work force in Canada and Australia (as well as Sweden and some other countries) have led to better jobs  and stronger pretax income growth.
Beyond education, these other countries do more to intervene in the free market on behalf of the middle class and the poor ...Middle-class stagnation is not preordained. No country has found a magic bullet, but many are doing some things better than the United States  and have the better results to show for it.

So which party in the US supports these changes to end middle class wage stagnation ? Doesn't sound like the Republican Party platform to me.   




 Why does anyone believe [anything](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/paul-ryan/statements/byruling/barely-true/ )  Paul Ryan says?  




 His argument to his former supporters, says one who spoke with him, is that he came very close in the last election against an incumbent president with a good economy. ... (Romney ran against Obama arguing that the economy was terrible; now its health in 2012 is part of the case why he should run again.) 

Can anyone explain to me why we should believe anything that comes out of Romney's mouth?  Or Paul Ryan's for that matter? 









 Most community colleges include 2 year programs that are aimed at specific careers, and those programs are [included in the proposal](http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/01/08/president-proposes-make-community-college-free-responsible-students-2-years). 
I'm not sure if it's true nationally, but every place I've lived you can leave school at 16. But we've decided to offer free education a couple years beyond the compulsory minimum, because we think it's worth doing. Adding a couple more years would probably help our economy even more. 




 Damn.  Just when you think you've seen the limit to hypocrisy, somebody pushes it out further. 




 Republicans are opposed to wealth redistribution.  Unless the direction is up. 




 No, I think it's more of a cultural division.  For centuries the Northeast has always been a high tax/high service approach to government and the South has taken a low tax/low service route.  You get better schools with the former approach. 




 The fact that he backed off with some boilerplate statements doesn't really change my mind. In the Senate we have had an [unprecedented obstructionism](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/nov/22/harry-reid/harry-reid-says-82-presidential-nominees-have-been/) of Presidential nominee, which doesn't indicate that the Republicans in the Senate where bent on co-operation.  
In the House we've a Representative yell "You lie" during the State of the Union Speech, and  the Republican majority used defaulting on the national debt as a negotiating tool, which is well outside the bounds of governance. I'm not arguing Obama is a saint, but again I simply don't see that where the blame is all on one side of the fence.  




 The single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president.

I don't recall any recent Democratic Congressional leader saying anything like this.  If I've missed it, please direct me to the source. Regardless, I fail to see where Obama has been any more unreasonable in his dealings with Congress than any other recent President.  And it seems to me everyone , Democratic and Republican, always complains that the failure to compromise is on the other side. 




 No argument with you, but unfortunately headlines tend to eliminate nuances. 




 What exactly has he done to alienate Congress?  And when the Republican leader of the Senate said his main goal was to make Obama a one term President, why would you think all the source of conflicts are on Obama's side?  




 Not to mention the NorthEast provides a much better education than most the country. Why some many people can't understand the connection between wealth and income is beyond me.   




 That's an impressive accomplishment. I doubt I would have done nearly as well in your situation.  But I fail to see what the advantage is in charging tuition for community college, any more than to charge to go to high school.  There's a pretty good argument that "both history and economics suggest that nothing may have a greater effect on the future of living standards than education policy" ([Link](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/09/upshot/the-roots-of-obamas-ambitious-college-plan.html). We need an educated workforce, and we should be doing every damn thing we can to make one.  




 [Or maybe not](http://reason.com/archives/2011/07/14/the-redblue-paradox). 




 Many community college students are juggling school, work and/or family responsibilities, so they may not be able to put the time in to earn top grades. At Community Colleges the 18-19  year olds attending on their parents' money are the exception.   




 Like most conservatives, all in favor of local control until someone passes a law they don't like. 




 But both history and economics suggest that nothing may have a greater effect on the future of living standards than education policy.

Skimp on educating the young and you'll pay the price several times over. Cutting education funding is both mean spirited and short sighted.

 Two questions we should ask politicians' who use this dodge.
'Since you're not an economist either, why are you offering opinions on that subject?'  and
'What other important issues are you incapable of understanding?"

 No, it's correct.  He just left off an adjective, it should be 'alternate reality-based scoring'. 




 Keep pushing and the conversation can change suddenly. Income inequality was hardly a topic before Occupy Wall Street.  




 If you need to tell us that something is "reality-based", it ain't. 




 Republican economic prescriptions have often seemed timeless in the Obama era, in a bad way.

By the way, this article is not some liberal snark, but by the executive editor of the National Review.

 Yet he still managed to make the least sense. 









 Anything to distract from the mess Brownback's [failed economic "experiment"](http://www.kansas.com/opinion/opn-columns-blogs/now-consider-this/article4703460.html). 




 If the American voter ever understands that the Republicans are really only serve the billionaires and bankers, watch out.  




 Brownback claimed it was a real-live experiment.  Wonder if he'll admit the experiment has failed 




 Who will Scott Walker blame Wisconsin's lousy economy on this time? 









 Private charity couldn't handle the needs of the poor in the U.S. for many years prior to the Great Depression.  During the Great Depression poverty became too widespread, and touched too many formerly middle class people to ignore.  




 Is this something that actually happens?  Frequently? 




 Karl Rove defends rectal feeding ... Some jokes just write themselves. 









  ...dismal wage growth is not just a sad but inevitable outcome of an efficient economy. Instead, its the result of a bundle of intentional policy decisions that were made precisely to shift economic power away from low- and middle-wage workers and towards corporate owners and managers.

 The author didn't include the environment in the list of winning progressive causes.  Which is probably the most important one of all. 




 Meanwhile Democrats, who should naturally have the upper hand in any honest fight for the increasingly populist American electorate, were too busy running away from President Obama to embrace the effective aspects of his agenda. As Andrew Sullivan wrote on Election Night, If you wonder, as I do, why Democrats never actually defend their policies or even achievements in power, and run solely on some poll-tested social issues, then your bafflement will likely only increase tonight, as mine has. The New Republics Alec MacGillis noted that in the three states that saw the biggest coverage gains under ObamacareKentucky, Arkansas and West VirginiaDemocratic Senate candidates shied away from pointing that out. And all lost badly, MacGillis tweeted.

Do you think the Democrats will ever offer the electorate a real choice?  Or are we in for more years of 'not quite as horrible as Republicans' as our alternative? 









 Yeah it  was pretty goddamn disappointing.  Do they really think it's not worth their while, or do they really think there is no difference?  But there's nothing else to do but keep trying to get them to show up.  (More of them will in 2016, almost assuredly. ) They'll vote more when they get older (everyone does because they realize how much politics impacts their lives), and hopefully won't turn so goddamn conservative when they age.  Or maybe something will energize them.  Minority vote was low for a long time, and now it's picked up (some places African American voting participation is higher than among whites. 
I also try not to put too much blame on anyone group. A whole lot of the democratic coalition didn't show up, not just younger people.  Why working class whites never figure out they're electing their worst economic enemies and keep voting Republican, I'll never understand.  And why the Democrats don't draw the contrast between themselves and Republicans in sharp focus, I don't get either.  If they did, they might get a few more young people excited about voting for them.  









 In the collected tales of AE Coppard (can't find an online link), when Johnny Flynn prays 'Oh God, make him give me a penny tonight, only a penny: make him give me a penny, please God. Amen.'

 He's already [whining](http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-02-22/walker-says-obama-religion-question-is-why-people-hate-the-media?cmpid=yhoo) about it. 




 OK then, let's think of the questions the media should be asking Scott Walker.  My suggestion would be, why do you feel you have the right to tell America so many [inaccuracies, misleading statements, and outright lies](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/scott-walker/)? 









 Here's a [start](http://www.progressive.org/news/2014/10/187897/scott-walker%E2%80%99s-corruption-problem). 




 None of this nonsense about tailoring bills to local needs.  Just pass the bills handed to you from Koch Industries.  Walker has sure increased Wisconsin's government efficiency, and made it much more responsive to its most important constituents.  




 They should use this bill as a campaign slogan - 'Passing laws written by out of state lobbyists for the People of Wisconsin' or 'Bringing legislation from lobbyists directly to you!' 




 Well now, that should clear up any final doubts about who Walker and the Wisconsin GOP are  working for. 




 Stop that.  You're going to wise up the American voter.  




 I prefer to think of him as their little "Scottie" dog.  Although now that you mention it, GOP could be an acronym for Greed's Obedient Puppets.  




 I'm sure Scott Walker loves America.  He just loves it's richest people better than the rest. 




 Giuliani's message these days is -  'Hey, I'm saying something outrageous, listen to me ! Over here, look at me!  Pay attention to me, to me!"  




 They [the Republicans] are attempting to cast themselves as the party of the middle class, even as they push policies that would undermine working families and exacerbate income inequality, the official said.

Why the Democrats haven't been pushing this such G.W. Bush took office, I'll never understand.  









 Welcome to Wisconsin - America's Low Wage, High Profit Paradise 




 Believers ignore evidence. No amount of failure will change the minds of the supply-siders.  They'll always be a reason that something else is causing the failure, and the policies will work, [just give it more time](http://www.kansascity.com/opinion/opn-columns-blogs/steve-rose/article7024256.html). Which is the excuse of failures everywhere. 




 All of Obama's cherished deficit reduction  accomplished at gruesome cost to the American people  will go straight to the 1 percent if Walker (or Jindal, or Jeb Bush) is elected.

Why don't the American people ever wise up to this game? 









 Voodoo Redux! 




 He sure is. An honest campaign slogan for Walker would be something like 'Help me help the richest' or 'Concentrating America's wealth at the top'. 




 I don't have an on-line source for this, but in The Empire of Liberty (Oxford History of America) page 577 reads "Although some of the founders ... were fairly devout Christians, most leading Founders were not deeply or passionately religious and few had much of a spiritual life ... Most of them, at best only passively believed in organized Christianity and, at worst, privately scorned and mocked it."  The leaders of the Revolution were more often men of the Enlightenment than men of the Bible.  
And on page 578 ... "it has been estimated that scarcely one in twenty Americans was a member of a formal member of a church."
The importance of religion ebbs and flows in American history.  As you point out it was very important a number of the colonies I should have said revolutionary , not colonial America), and would rise again during the second Great Awakening, but at the time of the revolution and the nation's founding, American was a largely secular place. (And I've oversimplified the situation in my summary here.  Get a hold of the Empire of Liberty if you want to learn more.  You'll be better informed about the early years of America than almost all your fellow citizens.)
Edit: Missing sentence 




 The Puritans certainly looked to the Old Testament for inspiration, so I guess you'd have a point.  However, colonial America wasn't a particularly religious society, many of our Founding Fathers were skeptical of religion (or indifferent church members)  and current form evangelical Christianity barely existed until the 19th century.  Do you think the Oklahoma legislators wants the AP course to cover those topics? I'm guessing not. 




 I'm glad to hear it that it's discussed in churches.  It's a very demanding message, but I can't ever recall anyone suggesting that we display it in courtrooms or public buildings.  




 P.J. O'Rourke was quite funny back in his prime. And that's my complete list of conservative humorists whose work I've enjoyed.  




 But not the [Sermon on the Mount](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205-7).  Somehow these fundamentalists always manage to overlook the inconvenient parts of the New Testament.

 Hope you're right.  But the math that worries me is the billion dollars the Koch Brothers are organizing for the election. 




 Paul Ryan - Nobody serves America's tax cheats better! 




 They want their own little obedient 'Scottie' dog to run the country for them. Since their goal is clearly to concentrate America's wealth at the top, they'll want a well trained puppy like Walker 









 They all work great in theory ... it's when you involve actual human beings they run into problems. 




 The article starts out with the question how does broadband in the US compare to other countries?  Well, if you remove the most populous states, which are the areas that have the densest population, (where you wouldn't have the physical limitations) from the comparison, I guess it looks pretty good.   




 FTFY - If you break up the US, none of the 10 most populous states make the list for the 10 fastest broadband places in the world.   




 I hope your right, but I'm not so sure.  The Koch Brothers and friends are planning on spending a billion dollars in 2016.  Might be enough to put anyone over the top. 




 His slash-and-burn policies of the past four years have nothing to do with responsible state governance. But they do signal to billionaire GOP campaign donors that he is willing to ride roughshod over the needs of the people in Wisconsin to prove that he can do the two things required of any contender for top office: Concentrate power in the executive office and **redistribute wealth upwards**. 

Why else would the Koch Brothers be so keen on this guy?  So we can have an economic system that's fair to everyone?

 









 Also Monday, the Legislature's nonpartisan budget office reported that Walker is delaying May debt repayment of $108 million to help balance the state's shortfall in the current budget ending on June 30.

Here come the accounting gimmicks.
 









 That's what a nation's enemies do, not its putative allies. 




 In the most recent poll, done in May 2014, a plurality, 42 percent, said God created humans in their present form

Damn that's a frightening number, isn't it? 




 Why doesn't the mainstream press call out or politicians on this nonsense?  How did we wind up with Rolling Stone as a better source of information than most of our "news" sources. 




 I meant the poor wages, no rights and exploitation part.  They can't be  owning up to that, are they? 




 But do you ever hear anybody point this out in the public debates about immigration? I haven't. 




 Thanks for the correction, I should have said few rights.  However, while illegal immigrants have rights under the law, the fear of arrest and deportation often means they are afraid to exercise and assert their rights, and have de facto no labor rights. 
edit: under the law, not until the law. 




 This is about my favorite comment about work and success. (Not too surprising. I hear you guys who go to MIT are pretty smart.)  I can look at my own career, and I see I've done reasonably well and worked reasonably hard, but luck (my first job happened to give me an opportunity to learn an in-demand skill ) and good judgement (choosing what tech skills to learn next) have had more to do with my success as hard work. There are plenty of people who have worked harder than I have and have a lot less to show for it.  




 I'm quite sure politicians of all persuasions will express a great concern about wage stagnation right up until Election day.  And then ... 




 If only she were an atheist as well. 




 Fits nicely with their climate change dodge. 




 Illegal immigrants are fearful for their jobs and have no rights.  Really, the new model for the American worker. Enjoy your future, American workers. 




 And will our legislators ever do anything about it? Probably not any time soon. It's like  tax cheating.  Their big donors benefit from loopholes and lax enforcement.  




 Out-of-state money, uninspiring opponents, and running in non-Presidential elections. Walker raised huge amounts of money to fight the recall In 2012. Wisconsin elected Tammy Baldwin to the Senate, who is about as far removed from Walker on the political spectrum as possible.  




 Given were the money if flowing, the Republican primary is looking like a Bush-Walker cage match.   




 It's probably more realistic strategy than running on his charisma and record of public service. 




 The Wisconsin tradition of fine public education - That's so over.

 Just in case anyone still isn't clear on the GOP agenda.  




 Nothing's more important to America's future than checking everyone's urine. 









 So extending the logic a bit, we don't need to pay Congress's   technology because Abraham Lincoln wrote with an ink pen.  We should stop paying for their airplane tickets to go to their district because James Madison traveled by horse drawn coach.  And we should remove the plumbing from Congress because if an outdoor privy was good enough for the Founding Fathers , it's good enough for clowns like Dave Brat. 




 Or better still, use state employment as a reward for your cronies and toadies.

 I'm sure they won't have any problem sacrificing their constituents access to health care in order to show how principled they are.

 So, I'm guessing "I misspoke" must be a Kansas regionalism for "I lied".

 




 In today's least surprising piece of news, more evidence that Ted Cruz is a hypocrite. 




 Control of Congress has allowed the Republican Party to defer its public campaign against Mr. Obamas initiatives, since they are dead on arrival. But the G.O.P. will not have that luxury in 2016, when it will need to offer a more cogent and specific response than it has so far.

I'm sure they'll go with the usual, a tax break that largely goes to the wealthy. 




 Shlaes and other fantasy tax-plan advocates have a big problem: Their math doesn't work.

They already are!  Look at how good they are with imaginary numbers.

 




 Yeah, instead of being under the thumb of corporate interests, like a good lawmaker is supposed to be. 




 How about the party of arithmetic?  But none of those fractions, they're too hard! 




 I think the Koch's prefer their own dog, little 'Scottie' Walker from Wisconsin. 









 So naturally the Republicans have embraced it. It's kind of a pattern. 




 Well, we do want to encourage that Entrepreneurial Spirit.  And you got to work with what you got. But seriously, I think its largely a way to throw another obstacle in the way of our poorest citizens.  If they were really interested in reducing people cheating the government, they'd go after contractor fraud or tax cheating. That would save us a lot more money than food stamp ID's. 




 We could even get [Bernie himself](http://onpolitics.usatoday.com/2014/09/19/bernie-sanders-folk-album-president/) to sing the songs.

 Excellent idea. Let's issue one to everyone who receives  food stamps, and then everyone on food stamps will have a valid government issued ID for voting. Although I wonder if the vote suppressing Republicans have truly thought this plan through.   




 He was hoping the 'fever would break' and he could reach some sensible compromises with the Republicans.  Sometimes optimism doesn't pay off. 




 We sent them a bill, representative Michael Burgess told Politico, and they need to pass it. They need to pass our bill. A tantrum is not far off. 

Yep, the Senate is supposed to pass all the bills the House sends it without modification.  Except then what's the point of having two chambers in Congress?   




 Judging from their views on economics, I think most Republicans find math a foreign language as well. 




 Hmm, you sound a whole lot [Paul Krugman](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/02/opinion/paul-krugman-twin-peaks-planet.html) there, who I'm guessing you're not a fan of. And as he points out in the article, there are a number of other things going on.
Furthermore, the travails of workers in rich countries are, in important ways, the flip side of the gains above and below them. Competition from emerging-economy exports has surely been a factor depressing wages in wealthier nations, although probably not the dominant force. More important, soaring incomes at the top were achieved, in large part, by squeezing those below: by cutting wages, slashing benefits, crushing unions, and diverting a rising share of national resources to financial wheeling and dealing.

 




 Christ almighty, the Keystone job bill again. It'll solve everything,  It's the 'key' to America's recovery. The corner'stone' to a bright American future.  C'mon GOP, you're not pushing it hard enough. 




 Butter him up and put him on plate. Rand Paul is toast.  Which is a shame.  I don't want him to be President, but if he stayed in the race as viable candidate, some of his better ideas, such as less foreign intervention and ending corporate welfare before reducing social programs might have become part of the Republican primary debate

 Too bad Russ Feingold doesn't want to run again.   




 Wait until the Republicans have control of all 3 branches of the government.  They'll turn America into a high-profit, low wage paradise. 




 Somehow that concern about government waste and inefficiency disappears whenever its money for defense. 




 Brownback should turn it into a campaign slogan "Helping Kansas Children by spending Less on Education" or "Ensuring a Bright Future for Kansas through crappy schools".  




 This should be an issue during his presidential campaign.  Scott Walker couldn't find criminal activity is his own office, but he'll keep America safe from terrorists.  




 Agreed.  Wisconsin is turning into North South Carolina. 




 Wisconsin is apparently now part of Dixie. 




 And yet people think Ryan's a hypocrite about the deficit. Puzzling, no? 




 No, but they've made a good start.

 Because their obeisance to wealthy interests and donors trumps their conservatism.   




 The GOP is making the Onion redundant.  




 Because the Republicans always win off year elections in Wisconsin. In presidential years, the electorate votes in Tammy Baldwin, who is about as close to the obverse of Scott Walker as you can imagine.

Jesus will open his Bible, rub their noses in Matthew 25, and send them on their downward way.
Edit:  Grammar 




 [Twat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twat) is in an excellent insult for these self-congratulatory, divisive, thin-skinned politicians. Vaguely obscene, and insulting to both their manhood and intelligence. I may need to start using for our own dear Scott Walker. 




 There are a number of ideas floating around, including a couple in the article.  But the issue is that Walker promised his economic policies would create 250,000 jobs in four years and it hasn't happened.  Instead of admitting that the projection might have been off the mark or that no Governor has enough control over an economy to make such a promise, (or even, heaven forbid, admit  that his policies might not give the results he expected) he's always blaming the protesters or the media or Obama or just about anyone else. Accept any responsibility for the lackluster economy in Wisconsin?  That's not the Scott Walker way. 




 Wisconsin ranked 40th in private sector job growth for the 12 months ending in September, said the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Walker has called hiring in his state the "gold standard" for measuring his performance.

But it must be somebody else's fault. Anybody else's fault.  









 It's a long term political strategy. [Because you know what educated people tend to do?](http://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2012/nov/05/larry-sabato/education-level-tied-voting-tendencies/) 




 It's not just this law. It's the whole culture of intolerance and hate that permeates the Republican politic.  If you're skin is dark, if you aren't rich, or if you don't love Jesus just the right way, the Republicans are itching to pass a law to make your life more difficult.

 Here we have today's most predictable headline.  




 Ornette Coleman's [Sound Grammar](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMFhCoobptCZLRf_XA_5bM6eUD2ru9GaQ)   His greatest album since the 1950's. 




 Our current income and wealth distribution are a choice, not some iron economic law.  If voters ever wise up to that, we'll see better wages.  As long as they keep falling for the trickle down-job creators -investment scam, they'll stay poor.  




 Unfortunately, beating down on the least successful and unfortunate has been good politics for a long time.   




 But it doesn't keep our little "Scottie" from being an obedient pooch for America's moneyed interests. 




 Lucian Leape, an adjunct professor of health policy at Harvard Universitys T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told PolitiFact, "I think these data are reliable, and the ACA (Affordable Care Act) deserves credit." Leape, who has been studying preventable hospital deaths since the early 1990s, credited improved data collection and the work of Partnership for Patients, "which has been a serious  and successful  effort to engage hospitals in achieving specific goals, such as reducing infections." **He said its the kind of effort he and others called for a decade and a half ago but "never got before the ACA. Hospitals were improving their safety slowly on their own, and this gave it a big boost.**

But what does he know about correlation and causality? 




 In other words, hospital deaths in general were already on a downward slope prior to the health care laws passage; its just accelerated since then. The authors of the report that Obama cited also hedged a bit on the causes for the decline, writing that "the precise causes of the decline in patient harm are not fully understood."

Seems to me they addressed that. 




 Self promotion is a full time job.  Ted can't be distracted by the legislative process. 




 I would say that "low cost methods of manufacturing fossil fuels from plant/animal waste" is a form of renewable energy.  Replacing coal (which is the real problem) will probably be a multi-pronged solution, a better grid, using natural gas in combination with solar and wind, or maybe a solution we can hardly imagine or think possible.  I don't think the Wright Brothers thought their invention and those barely functional automobiles would replace the train as the main methods of transportation in America within a few generations. 




 Bernie, run for President already, will you? You're not going to win the nomination (any more than Ted Cruz is going to), but you could sure change the conversation. 




 Not long ago cellphones were unaffordable for most people, and a computer was something at a university or business that you waited for a turn to use. The communications and computer power we all have now were almost unimaginable just a few decades ago, and at a far lower price that very few anticipated.  I would argue we could effect the same change in energy.  A couple of decades of research and spending could change energy production and distribution completely, the same way communications and computing power have changed. Sticking with the fossil fuels is looking backward, like insisting that an IBM 360 mainframe and a AT T landline will serve all our future needs.  




 The problem isn't going to fixed by taxing the wealthy, it's going to fixed by changing the economic system. Between [1979-2007 period, after-tax income of households in the top 1 percent of earners grew by 275%, compared to 65% for the next 19 percent, just under 40% for the next 60 percent, 18% for the bottom fifth of households.] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_inequality_in_the_United_States#Post-1970_increase) 
I can't imagine that the top 1% started earning 275% more because they've become so much more productive and insightful.  We have a political party wholly in the thrall of the wealthy, and it's serving them very well. 




 The best way to infuriate Christians is not by ignoring religion, but by suggesting they're not taking following Christ's teaching.  Kasich trolls such Christians pretty well himself ["And I was saying how amusing it is to me that the conservative movementa big chunk of which is faith-basedseems to have never read Matthew 25."](http://www.nationaljournal.com/magazine/how-arrogant-prickly-smart-john-kasich-would-upend-2016-20150306)
 




 Because she has more balls than any male Republican legislator? 




 That'll fix everything.  Good thing Florida's legislature is concentrating on the crucial issues. 




 Only 16 out of 45.  Almost 2/3 voted against. 




 I would like nothing better than to see Walker go on a military base and tell everyone being an Eagle Scout makes him fully qualified to be their commander in chief.  This guy is either hopelessly deluded or hopelessly cynical.  Possibly both. 




  But still, whenever I hear talk that the Republicans intend to tackle inequality, I cant help thinking of Deep Throats adage: follow the money.

If you do that, you can readily understand everything the GOP has been doing for last few decades. 
Edit: typo 









 Cutting education spending is key to a prosperous America.  




 Probably true. If I heard that Cruz been smokin' up with Willie, it would improve my opinion of him. 




 Vote Republican! You don't want any rights or protections at work, do you? 




 Obama has his priorities straight.  An antibiotic resistant bacteria could kill a whole lot Americans than ISIS ever will.  




 I would go with Joan of Arc. That would allow him to fully express his heroic martyrdom.  




 That's why it's all the more surprising when he does something that makes sense. 




 Check out the ratings for Ted Cruz at [Politifact](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/ted-cruz/) , [Factcheck.Org](http://www.factcheck.org/2015/03/factchecking-ted-cruz/) or the [Washington Post's Fact Checker] (http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/wp/category/2016-candidates/).  Why does this guy still have any credibility at all?  Except for on the subject of [toilet seats](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/ted-cruz/statements/byruling/true/).  He's a real truth teller when the subject is toilet seats. 




 Ending refundable tax credits and tax subsidies for business?  There are now two things I agree with Bobby Jindal on.  The other being when he said the Republicans needed to stop being "the party of stupid".  









 ...hoped GOP voters misunderstood

Has pretty much the GOP election strategy for last few decades 









 [PolitiFact](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/allen-west/) has rated 72% of Allen West's statements Mostly False, False, or Pants on Fire.  




 Perhaps we've underestimated the man.  Maybe he says these things because he has a finely tuned sense of irony and sarcasm. 




 When you have a [exceptional talent for dishonesty ](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/ted-cruz/), it's a shame not to use it.  




 I hadn't read it. That's hilarious.  Politifact has rated one Ted Cruz statement as wholly true. It was about toilet seats. 




 "Today the global warming alarmists are the equivalent of the flat-Earthers," Cruz said. "You know it used to be it is accepted scientific wisdom the Earth is flat, and this heretic named Galileo was branded a denier."

This clown can't even get his [basic facts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_affair) straight. Galileo was called a heretic over his heliocentric theory, not over the shape of the earth 




 Other income indicators also that show Wisconsin is heading in the right direction under Governor Walker, Patrick said Monday
...But UW-Madison economist Laura Dresser said **income growth in the state for decades has been concentrated among the top 1 percent**. She said that would explain the decline in the percentage of families considered middle class by federal standards, even if incomes have risen recently.
 
That would be exactly what the GOP thinks is the right direction. 




 Why not? Using the aircraft carrier as a prop worked so well for George W. Bush. 




 The actual math is this: $108 billion divided by 12 million equals $9,000. ... Aides declined to explain or comment on the inflated cost estimate.

Really, what could they say? "Mr. Sessions stands by his inability to do long division."

 




 Check out Ted's history at [Politifact](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/ted-cruz/).  2% of his statements are rated true. 2%! Even among politicians, this guy manages to stand out with his lack of integrity. 




 [Gop_hates_God](http://np.reddit.com/user/GOP_Hates_God) has posted a great collection of Bible verses that Republicans never seem to cite. 




 No, they pick and choose the verses they like.  Kind of like they do with global warming data. 




 Ted Cruz , proving once again you can drop a load of BS without actually lying.   




 Seems to me Walker promised his policies would reverse that trend and create 250,000 jobs in 4 years.   




 I would like to see a billboard with Scott Walker's picture and this Bible quote on it.  Or most other Republican Presidential candidates for that matter. 




 I prefer to think of us as South Carolina North. 




 Don't blame Walker!  It's somebody else's fault. Anybody else. 




 Yeah he is. Anybody who would say this "I was saying how amusing it is to me that the conservative movement  a big chunk of which is faith-based  seems to have never read Matthew 25." is my kind of Christian. 




 Even a dog finds its ass every once in awhile.

Much better than the old line about a stopped clock is right twice a day.  




 George Will is like one of those aging Baby Boom rockers. He might have done some interesting work in the 70's , but he's been repeating himself and getting increasingly less interesting for decades. 




 No, of the potential Republican Presidential candidates, I would prefer Kasich. Though he seems like a long shot. 




 If you'd prefer polysyllabic words, we could say he's sanctimonious, unmannerly, and solipsistic.  Asshole is just shorthand.  




  If you did a web search for Senators Hate Ted Cruz on Sunday, that Foreign Policy article wouldnt have even come up on the first Google page. It was supplanted by titles like Why Senate Republicans Hate Ted Cruz, GOP Still Despises Ted Cruz, Everybody Hates Ted Cruz and the generously titled How Unpopular Is Ted Cruz Right Now? Answer: very.

TL DR: Because he's an asshole. 




 I think most liberals are awake.  It's the working class whites that need to catch on.  




 I cut an afternoon of high school and saw Buddy Guy (with Junior Wells) in 1973 at a blues festival.  He was great then too. Been a good long run for the man.  




 If he's telling us he's going to be an extraordinary useful tool for the bankers and billionaires, I'll go along with it.    




 The charts showing gerrymandering and money in politics are more than a bit sobering.  Not much of a democracy we're living in these days. 









 Scott Walker's Wisconsin - a high profit, low wage paradise. 




 However, when you include all taxes,  taxes [are not particularly progressive](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2012/09/19/heres-why-the-47-percent-argument-is-an-abuse-of-tax-data/) in the United States. 




 You look at this budget and you wonder why Republicans are accused  of not having a sense of humor. They obviously know how to tell a good joke. 




 "You dangle $700 million in front of the Louisiana Legislature now, and it's going to be spent as fast as green grass goes through a goose," the treasurer said

The party of fiscal responsibility in action! 




 Muhammad Saeed al-Sahhaf is the true intellectual inspiration for America's conservatives. 




 The Iranians were clearly made aware of the contents of the letter, but the GOP are claiming doesn't count because it wasn't actually sent through the mail?  Seems the Iranians see if [differently](http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-iran-nuclear-talks-20150316-story.html) 

 And check out the article if you want to read a fine example of NRO's hysterical hyperventilation
Obama is desperate for a deal with this radical-Islamic, terrorist-sponsoring, IED-detonating regime. And he wants Republicans to shut up about it. If Obama finds this Republican medicine bitter, he should stop pouring his own acrid elixir down their throats.
 




 Lie is such a harsh word. Let's just say it was a [drafting error](http://www.jsonline.com/news/politifact-debunking-scott-walkers-wisconsin-idea-drafting-error-claim-b99440321z1-291066791.html). 




 Well as long as it's not someone from the present, like Scott Walker. Besides, if Scott Walker becomes President, our future leaders will likely have Chinese names.  




 Bobby Jindal is angling for a position at Fox News.  




 If I were Walker, I don't think I'd want people to look too closely at his time in office in Wisconsin.  I can just imagine the attack ads if he's the Republican nominee -  'Scott Walker couldn't find criminal activity in his own office - Now he's telling us he can lead America against terrorists?' 




 Also no one in Florida is allowed to say Voldemort out loud. 




 Read the article and tell me if you think these position changes seem like a change of conviction or political convenience.  




 Once you decide the truth is flexible, everything is easy. 









 I bet Ted Cruz is pissed.  




 Somehow I don't think the ALEC approved Wisconsin Supreme Court is going to show a lot of sympathy to this lawsuit. 




 A politician with guts. Feingold was the only senator to vote against the Patriot Act. 




 Could you imagine the reaction on Fox News if the Democrats tried this stunt under a Republican President?  Yet now, the outrage seems somewhat muted. 




 They ought to make it their campaign slogan -  Putting our party's interests ahead of America's security. 




 The GOP = 35 years of Higher Profits and Lower Taxes for the Wealthy, Lower Wages and Higher Taxes for Everyone else.  Everyone else really needs to wise up.   




 Perhaps, but if you strip it down to 3 it'll take awhile to crap it back up.  




 Why not a 3 tiered tax rate?  Almost as simple and would generate more revenue.   And it could be adjusted as economic needs changed.  Not enough investment capital? Drop the rate on the highest tier. Not enough consumer spending.  Lower the rate , or raise the amount of income  taxed, in the lowest tier. 




 How about we use the same level of proof that we used to justify invading Iraq?   




 Adults with dependent children can participate in KanCare, but only if they have incomes below 33 percent of the federal poverty level, $7,770 annually for a family of four.

Am I understanding this correctly?  If your family income is $2000 per person, you're not eligible for Medicaid in Kansas?   




 Just when you think politicians have reached the limit of ludicrous self-promotion, somebody raises the bar. 









 It would be more surprising if Walker continued funding this program. Renewable energy threatens the interests of his backers. 




 Specifically you want to thank the [Milwaukee suburbs and rural Wisconsin](http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/wisconsin-2014-fall-election-results-map-281509401.html).  




 If you're looking for a President who does what the lobbyists want, you can't do better than Scott Walker. 









 Then I'm sure ALEC is in favor of lowering the wages down for bankers and CEO's ... Wait, or do they mean somebody else's wages?  The American worker really needs to wise up that there's an obscene rakeoff going on at the top. We can't have decent wages and social services while supporting a greedy upper class. 




 Unsurprising turn of events.  The GOP should adopt a new slogan - 'Vote Republican - You don't want any rights or protections at work anyway.' 




 Either this is a pretty good prank or you need to check your links. 




 And now his going to [France](http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/story/money/2015/02/26/wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-plans-european-trade-mission/24057149/).  Maybe he'll compare handing the union protests to the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attack. 




 Nobody is better qualified to lead the fight against terror than the guy  who couldn't find [criminal activity](http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/walker-scandal-who-got-convicted-why-n35886) in his own office. 




 I'd call Inhofe an imbecile, but I think he doesn't quite measure up. 




 Fraudsters gotta fraud. 




 Sounds like something out of Charles Dickens, doesn't it? 




 The GOP game is to concentrate wealth at the top.  Why that isn't obvious to everyone, and why the Democrats don't make more of an issue out of it is a continuing mystery to me.  




 I think everything is working as planned.  Most of the earlier tax cutting was on income taxes, and are being replaced with 'much regretted' consumption taxes and fees, which fall more heavily on lower and middle classes.  I used to believe the good sense of the American people wins out in the end.  Now, I'm beginning to think it's their gullibility. 




 By all means, let's listen to the man who told us the Iraq war will pay for itself.  Who knows what new inanities he has to tell us? 




 Republicans being incredibly misleading ... you know, I think I've heard this before. 




 Yes, it is a bit hyperbolic, and I believe I first read the remark about studies about health, which are particularly polluted with sponsored 'studies'.  But it is also true that industry looks for scientists who are already inclined toward the viewpoint they want. (I'm not saying the scientists themselves are dishonest. I assume they legitimately believe their arguements.) You notice these industries didn't pick a random professor of atmospheric science to study the problem, they funded the one who was likely to say what they wanted to hear. Sponsoring studies with an outcome in mind that would be to your own financial and political advantage far more 'negligent to science' than some skepticism about a study and its funding sources.  




 No not really.  Studies sponsored by an industry tend to support what the industry wants.  They look to hire researchers that are favorable to their industry, and if the results aren't too their liking, they're not required to publish them. 
Obviously, there are studies from independent sources that aren't biased, but generally they aren't sponsored by anyone with an agenda.  




 Mr. Bush and other presidential hopefuls said the presidents patriotism was not in doubt. But Mr. Walker repeatedly said he did not know. On Saturday, he said he did not know whether Mr. Obama was a Christian.

The Democrats should also play this game.  Some former Presidential candidate should accuse Walker of hypocrisy and dishonesty, and then everyone can say that they don't know if Walker is a hypocritical liar, Make it part of the public discussion.
 




 Want to know what a study says?  Don't bother to read it, just look at who paid for it.   




 Retired homeowners rarely seem to understand is that the quality of the school district is a big part of what makes up their home's value.  They'll save a few dollars on their tax bills, but might lose it several times over on their home's equity. 
























 To achieve the American dream all you need is hard work and a billionaire friend to provide financial assistance.  




 Mr. Braman and aides to Mr. Rubio have declined to say how much personal financial assistance he has provided to Mr. Rubio and his wife, directly or indirectly, but it appears to total in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Does anybody else think this might cast a shadow on Marco Rubio's up from the working class story?   









 Mansplain your conservative political views to me. 




 I was hoping Obama was going to seize it and give in back to Mexico.  'Sorry, turns out we didn't need this. More trouble than it's worth. Except for Willie Nelson. We'll be keeping him.' 




 Fortunately there's no charge to not sit next to a member of Congress while not attending a Taylor Swift concert. 




 In all fairness to Walker, giving corporations cash was the important part of the equation.  




 Good article, but the huge amounts of outside and dark money being spent on the 2016 campaign are a wild card. No one really knows how much that's going to influence the results in contested states. 




 He just wanted to show that anyone can succeed in America!!  It just takes hard work!! And some insider information and the willingness to skirt the law!1 




 Good news.  But since we have about 3 decades of wage stagnation to recover from, don't get overly excited. 




 The GOP loves local control!  Except when local governments do something that they don't like. 




 Cardiologists actually make [rather more than 250K](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jacquelynsmith/2012/07/20/the-best-and-worst-paying-jobs-for-doctors-2/2/), and I imagine the cardiologists in NYC make more than the average. 




 You can start with [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpKB6OZ_B4c). 




 Scott Walker - Ending Wisconsin's Tradition of Fine Public Education !!

I'm offering him this slogan for his own use, free of charge. 




 All the King's Men by Robert Penn Warren. No book, fiction or non, tells a better story about how American politics work.  Empire of Liberty by Gordon S. Wood, about the first years of the Republic, is the best for early American politics.  Turns out much of today's political conflict goes back to the nation's start. 




 It would help if we started making clearer the ties between campaign financing and the actions of politicians.  Somehow it's considered impolite in mainstream media to point that, to pick a particularly execrable politician , James Inhofe the Senate's leading climate change deniers, and how much of his [campaign funding](http://maplight.org/us-congress/legislator/576-jim-inhofe) he receives from oil and gas and electric industries.  




 Repeat until understood. 




 'Politically driven science' being 'science we disagree with'. 




 Well, most of them are pretty smart. 




 Wisconsin is one of the states where the middle class is disappearing the [fastest](http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2015/3/19/the-shrinking-middle-class-mapped-state-by-state), and these nitwits are spending their time micromanaging food stamps benefits. Way to address the important issues guys.   




  Ryan said he has strong concerns that reining in campaign spending could have a "chilling effect" on free speech. **If donors had to disclose their identities when they gave to charitable groups or some nonprofits, he fears that individuals could be retaliated against for expressing themselves politically.** "I see an attempt to infringe on First Amendment rights, to give some people more tools to harass citizens from participating in democracy and expressing themselves, and I don't think that is a good thing," Ryan said during a Christian Science Monitor breakfast Thursday morning.

Ryan is telling us the first amendment is supposed to protect you from being harassed if you express your opinion?  Novel interpretation.   




 If we invest in green energy and makes a few tweaks to how we consume energy and dispose of waste, energy can be far cheaper, cleaner and more abundant in the future.

That's the argument we should be making for getting off the carbon.  Continuing to rely heavily on fossil fuels is holding us back from cheaper energy.   




 William James thought there were [3 steps](http://quoteseverlasting.com/quotations/2013/06/19/6792/a-new-idea-is-first-condemned-as-ridiculous-and-then-dismissed-as-trivial-until-finally-it-becomes-what-everybody-knows-william-james/) each new idea goes through. I'd say Charles Koch is trying out stage two. 




 I say Walsh is speaking gibberish, but I don't think it reaches that level. 




 Rand Paul blamed Eric Garner's death on [cigarette taxes](http://www.cnn.com/2014/12/03/politics/rand-paul-eric-garner-taxes/).  You might want to start considering, just a wee little, how the police behavior figures in these problems. 




 When politicians depend on the support of a handful of wealthy individuals and corporations, whose interests do you think they're going to put first?  Yours?  The nations? Or their benefactors? 




  After reading a little more of Chaits work, I see him as some kind of New York Times wannabe. He is one of those cliched, tiresome liberals who is always trying too hard. You know the type.

You mean statements like this? 




 Is this a serious remark or an attempt at humor? 




 Once upon a time, it was thought ridiculous and absurd to think women should be treated equal to men. The 21st century is ready when you are Marco!
 




 Apparently, having an opinion different from Ted Cruz makes you either a communist or a fascist.  The man is an overwrought weenie. 




 The preferable solution, but if it's not politically possible to implement a tax, a subsidy for low carbon forms of energy could serve as a backdoor way of charging for the external costs of carbon. 




 Different music for different moods.  I generally prefer listening to more complex music, but sometimes I want to hear something uncluttered and direct, like a Howling Wolf blues or Hank Williams ballad.  




 Even if the costs alternatives (like coal) don't include their indirect costs?  




 Indeed.  Here is an [fine performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNegch1_dyU) of a devastating piece by a composer who is none of the above.  




 If you like Kind of Blue and mellower music,  I would say [Relaxing] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vNreXKw2Qw) or [Cooking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcIiu1kQMx0) with the Miles Davis Quartet ought to  be your next listen.  




 Judging from my own experience, I'd say classical music (in the widest sense of the word) would gain a bigger audience if the performers and promoters started presenting more 20/21st century pieces.  For listeners coming from a jazz or rock background, I think Stravinsky, Glass, Shostakovich, Whitacre or (insert your favorite modern or  contemporary composer here) are much more readily accessible than music from the Classical and Romantic Eras.

Edit: missing words 




 Something Happened isn't as great, but it's a fine satirical novel.  And God Knows is great for the first 70 pages or so, as good as Catch-22.  




 Not like the 60's when we had challenging lyrics like 'Yummy, yummy, yummy, I got love in my tummy.' Ah bubblegum music. 




 It as if the GOP doesn't want Wisconsin citizens knowing how much money and time their governor is spending 'promoting the state's economy'. 




 Extracting tax subsidies and paying it's cashiers [less than $9 an hour](http://www.glassdoor.com/Hourly-Pay/Kohl-s-Hourly-Pay-E592.htm).  Kohl's is the perfect company for Walker's economic vision. 









 I've had [this album](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Best_of_Bud_Powell_on_Verve) for about 20 years and I've never grown tired of it. [This one](http://www.amazon.com/Steal-Away-Spirituals-Hymns-Songs/dp/B0000046YU) isn't bad either. And why hasn't anybody mentioned [Earl Hines] (http://www.amazon.com/Jazz-Royalty-Hines-Plays-Ellington/dp/B00000J39U). 




 The QCEW data show Minnesota slowing down from March 2013 to March 2014. But the CES data do not. The truth is probably somewhere in the middle  and thats why we collect data on employment from multiple perspectives. ... private sector job growth in Minnesota was faster after the Great Recession than Wisconsins. 

[No, Minnesota is not 'dead last' in the Midwest in job growth](http://www.minnpost.com/macro-micro-minnesota/2014/10/no-minnesota-not-dead-last-midwest-job-growth) 




 As he tours the country, Walker has boasted that new businesses are starting up in Wisconsin at a higher rate than the rest of the country and that income growth for residents exceeds the national average.

Although he might prefer you don't ask him how the [income growth](http://www.wisconsinbudgetproject.org/pulling-apart-2014)  is being distributed.   




 I hope their candidate includes this in his advertising.  Something like 
Scott Walker - the Best Boy for the Billionaires! 




 I'm still waiting for a right to work advocate to explain how lower wages will lead to prosperity. 




 Taxes are the wrong problem.  More income for the poor and middle class would generate more jobs than tax cuts. 




 Problem accurately and succinctly stated. Please repeat until understood. 




 I'm sure learning that Scott Walker busted Wisconsin's teachers union will strike fear in heart of America's enemies. 




 The real question isn't why Wisconsin is lagging in wage and job growth. The real question is who Scott Walker will blame this month. 




 GOP lawmakers want the poor to pay for tax cuts for the rich

FTFY
 




 Push the income to the top, push the taxes to the bottom.  That's all you need to know about 21st GOP economic goals. 




 Ted Cruz is [owned](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/416643/meet-ted-cruzs-billionaire-donors-eliana-johnson) by conservative billionaires. 




 Something I wouldn't have expected from Pat Metheny.  I much prefer this collaboration to Ornette Coleman's other work around the same time. 









 True. Accurate science, like evolution or climatology, is not acceptable. 




 About time someone said this about the GOP economy this clearly and unambiguously.   









 Since Kohl's received a huge tax subsidies and pays low wages, I'd say it's the perfect model for the economy Walker wants to create. 




 Thats how I think about your money, the taxpayers money. The government could charge you a higher rate and a few of you could afford it, or we could lower the rates, broaden the base and have more people participate in the economy.

Yes, because so many of us have the option of not participating in the economy if we think the tax rate is too high.   




 The [most authoritative study](http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-04-17/kansas-governor-brownbacks-lab-for-steep-tax-and-budget-cuts) of the effect of these measures is a January report by the Kansas Legislative Research Department, a nonpartisan arm of the legislature. It found that revenue isnt keeping up with expenses even after cuts in spending on K-12 schools, colleges, libraries, local health departments, courts, and welfare. If nothing changed, the research departments numbers show, the states general fund would have a shortfall of about $900 million by fiscal year 2019, or 14 percent of expenses that year. The states constitution requires a balanced budget, so either taxes will have to go back up or spending will have to come down even more. **The tax cuts dont pay for themselves,** says Duane Goossen, who served as state budget director under both Republican and Democratic governors. **That just is not happening.**

But I doubt any number will rattle the true believers.  Tax cuts are always good, and any contrary evidence is denigrated or ignored. 




 Ted Cruz - America needs a tough talking weenie for President! 




 I'm hoping God tells him to go for it.  And tells him to smite Walker, Bush, Rubio, Paul, and Cruz with a sword. 




 Something else that's always changing is the methods for and the costs of generating energy from non-fossil fuels.  Sticking with carbon is a loser's choice. 




 Like Sara Palin, Walker plays the politics of resentment quite well. Wisconsin's biggest economic problems center around the still shrinking manufacturing economy, but Walker's managed to convince part of the electorate that Wisconsin's problems are the over-educated liberals, overpaid civil servants and welfare recipients.  Meanwhile he's greatly reduced public services, ended many employment protections, and has ground down Wisconsin's education system, which was one the finest in the country.  He wants to makeover Wisconsin into the low wage model, typically found in the reddest states. I see the strategy he's using, but why people keep falling for it, I wish I understood.  




 Try Go Down Moses. 




 [At $8.57 an hour for a cashier](http://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/Kohl-s-Salaries-E592.htm), the Kohl's model would align perfectly with Walker's economic goals.  This man isn't worth his own turds.  




 Governors in Wisconsin are elected for for year terms. 2012 was a recall election, and was not held at the same time as the Presidential election. 




 Whereas Paul needs a toy bucket to hold his accomplishments. 




 Wisconsin has two electorates, one that only shows up in Presidential election years and one that shows up for every election. In Presidential election years, Wisconsin elects senators like Tammy Baldwin and Russ Feingold, and almost always votes for the Democratic Presidential candidate (albeit sometimes by very thin margins).  In off year elections, when the voting population skews older, Wisconsin elects conservatives like Walker and Ron Johnson.  









 And we all thought he was an arrogant politician, growing up cossetted and wealthy environment.  But look he drives his own car! And he eats fast food! So he must care about common Americans.  He's truly one of us! 




 Hope you're right.  No time to get complacent though. 




 It's likely to only get worse. Budget cuts to the IRS will make it [even easier](http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2014/12/rich-people-cheer-republicans-cut-irs-budget) for the wealthy to evade taxes and lowers the risk of an audit.  The Dems should make it a campaign issue.   




 Finally, a ray of light here in Wisconsin. 









 Passing pointless , grandstanding laws that smack down the unsuccessful and unfortunate.  Your GOP in action!!! 




 Claims to help the poor, actually hurts them. Pretty much the regular GOP playbook. 




 And these guys are supposed to appeal to millennials?  




 You're correct, a business exists to earn money. The job-creating claim is used to justify special tax breaks for and reduce restrictions on businesses. 




 I obviously can't speak to your family's tax situation, but I really don't see any reason to doubt the numbers in [this chart](http://ctj.org/ctjreports/2015/04/who_pays_taxes_in_america_in_2015.php#.VS7kpfnF9AY). 




 Sure it's an important part of the economy.  But right now we capital sitting idle (people are buying government bonds at zero interest) because there aren't enough investment opportunities.  The economy is short of demand now, not capital.  




 It's not people who are working 80 hours a week building a business that are pulling a trick, and it's not even the 1% that pulling a trick. It's the investor class .1% (or even the .01%) that are running off with a huge share of America's income.   




 If you're wealthy, you're not going to be taxed when you're dead.  Your heirs are going to be taxed, who didn't do anything but win the birth lottery.  Part of the reason for estate taxes is that great concentrations of wealth tend to destabilize countries, especially democracies. (You need to have 5 million before the estate tax is an issue.)  




 Again the consumer demand would make it worthwhile to start a bakery. But the point of the analogy is that an economy requires both sellers and buyers, supply and demand, and the GOP has given way to much credit and advantage to the suppliers, to the point where it's starting to suppress demand.  




 This comment from Temuzjin summed it up pretty well

To create jobs, you generally need supply of goods and demand for goods.
A rich entrepreneur who hires people to make goods helps with the supply side. These are commonly called "job creators."
However, you could just as easily call a guy who buys a loaf of bread (or another good) a "job creator" because he or she helps with the demand side. Without demand, jobs that supply goods soon become unprofitable, which means that those jobs vanish. 




  The "rich" are not a fixed set of people.

The GOP is trying to [fix that] (http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/republicans-push-for-a-permanent-aristocracy/2015/04/14/aa434f82-e2e5-11e4-81ea-0649268f729e_story.html). 




 Refresh my memory, who was pushing for the war, Bush and the Republican legislators or the Democrats? 




 The point is that you need multiple ingredients to create jobs, especially consumers.  To say that the wealthy are the job creators is like saying that gasoline is what makes cars move, and ignoring everything else. I also noticed you didn't include anyone from the investment and banking industries, which is group that has benefited the most over the last decades. 




 They wouldn't have created many jobs without a middle class to spend money on their products. And I notice you didn't include any one who inherited their wealth on your list. 




 It's the same game of hide the ball the GOP has playing since the 1980's.  Look at this tax cut!  Think how much working families will save! No need to look at the numbers too closely.  It's a tax cut for everybody! 




 Telling us they're the 'job creators' was another pretty good one. People have been falling for that one for decades.

Edit: I don't think I've ever posted anything on Reddit that recieved this many responses, 
(some of them quite good). So, while I have your attention, please let me elaborate a little:

Take your investment capital and try to run a successful job-creating business in a place that lacks.

- a government that enforces contracts

- a government that protects you against physical assault and fraud.

- Government services (Take your brilliant idea for a business and open it a place with crappy roads
and no public transportation.  Or for a real challenge, a place with no public water and sewer.)

- competent employees (who in America, have usually been educated at public expense)

- or most importantly, customers with money to spend

Sure investment capital plays a role in creating jobs and wealth.  But it's not the whole game.  The conservatives have exaggerated the role capital plays in the economy, and used it as a reason to justify low taxes or public giveaways to business, to reduce the rights and protections of employees, and policies that reduce labor's share 
of the [national income](http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/09/why-labors-share-of-income-is-falling/l).  




 To be fair, they also did a pretty good job of weakening America when George W. Bush was president. 




 Today's Republican Party! Making America's economy work very well for a very few! 




 Dumb as a 50 lb. bag of potatoes, those Idaho lawmakers. 




 Apparently we need to be either subtle or sarcastic, not both. 




 I hope he doesn't spend too much time working on his inauguration speech.  [Current odds](http://www.oddsshark.com/entertainment/us-presidential-odds-2016-futures) are not running in his favor. 




 While other GOP contenders have called for loosening penalties for nonviolent drug offenders, Rubio has not ... He has also said that marijuana "is not good for the country," and that he thinks there's "no responsible way to recreationally use" it.

Unlike, say, alcohol. 




 Guess I should have added an /s.   




 Once again, needless government regulations are obstructing a business.  Think the GOP will pick up on this?

Edit:  Holy Molyl, this is certainly an impressive number of downvotes.  I didn't think this was needed, but **/S**. 




 Can't see why. The changes he wanted to make was about the only time he's been honest with Wisconsin.  




 Wong Michelle. God is punishing us with a plague of Republicans. 




 Ken Burn's Jazz Series is a decent enough introduction.  




 I don't think the super PACs funding our elections are run by people who spend a lot of time on buses. Or care much about the people taking them. 




 Well, they'd feel pretty foolish if they paid retail for a candiate like Ted Cruz. 




 We cannot quite say Paul committed a Four-Pinocchio violation, but its close.

But the kid's got a lot of talent.  Bet he does it next time. 




 If we ignore climate change, maybe it'll go away.  Or maybe we'll go away. 




 Somehow, the GOP only gets hysterical and overwrought about the deficit when the issue is social service spending. Tax cuts for the wealthy or defense spending?  No worries!     









 So thats why ALEC and Scott Segal are signaling to other conservatives to shut the heck up about climate science  not because any flood of solutions is forthcoming, but because the science fight has become a distraction from the real work, the important work, which is blocking solutions and protecting the interests of the wealthy.

Get ready for a new exciting set of lies about climate change! From the people who've been lying about climate change for last 30 years! 




 It's as if they've discovered an antidote for facts. 




 Haskins called it a rather extreme position to say that we ought to allow dangerous pollutants to destroy the only planet we know of that can completely sustain human life, and he suggested work on technologies that can reduce CO2 emissions without destroying whole economies.

Tell me, after your organizations spent a couple decades trying to deny an obvious truth, why would I take any argument offered by ALEC or the Heartland Institute seriously in the future? 




 I don't understand why.  They never seem to have a problem ignoring the interests of middle and lower income Americans. 




 He certainly shows the same ability to understand [environmental issues](http://thesciencewritingblog.com/2014/09/07/ronald-reagan-said-trees-cause-more-pollution-than-automobiles-do-ignoring-trees-conversion-of-co2/).

Edit: missing word 




 "'Now this was the sin of your sister Sodom: She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy.

Arrogant,overfed and unconcerned -  Looks like the GOP has hit the trifecta.  




 Far right I can understand. One can make cogent arguments for conservative positions.  It's this sort of nonsensical legislation that makes me wonder if their brains have lost partial function. 
























 Later on in his speech, Sanders talks about how many Americans are working more than 40 hours a week. If we don't need people to produce, why are we putting in so many hours?  




 That would mean about1 person out of 30 in the area attended the Bernie Sanders speech.  I know there must have been out of town attendees and it is hyper-political progressive Madison, but still, that's a pretty impressive percentage of the area population at any event. 




 And Honda Fit's.  Suddenly every third driveway in my neighborhood has a Honda Fit. 




 I'd say it took about 20 years for gay marriage to go from a fringe issue to mainstream acceptance.  I'd expect the polygamists have some work ahead of them. 




 I think Tom Coburn (former Republican Senator OK) [summed up](http://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/tom-coburn-on-2016-gopers-cruz-and-walker-not-ready-for-prim#.oq0jRkpnQ) the Wisconsin recall the best.

Coburn said Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker is not ready for primetime in my opinion. He said Walker didnt win the recall election in 2012 but Republicans around the country did it for him.

Wisconsin was flooded with outsider money which propped up Walker.  That and a lack of decent Democratic candidates to oppose him.  




 I hope he is.  I was there. Who do I speak to about my check? 




 These sorts of crowds aren't unusual for Madison. 30,000 came to see Obama in 2012. **80,000** people showed up to see John Kerry in 2004. OK, it was John Kerry and Bruce Springsteen, but still, Madison is a great place if you're a progressive Democrat and want a big turnout. 




 Or perhaps he's a Democratic plant ...  Look I just started my own conspiracy theory. 




 Indeed, early in the negotiating process with Walker, union leaders said they would concede to his demands for higher employee contributions to pensions and health care if he would drop his insistence on gutting collective bargaining. The governor said no.

It was never about money.  It was about reducing the power of groups that support Democrats. 




 Citing a department study, Bratton has said that he doesn't believe the large drop in stop and frisk activity -- from nearly 700,000 in 2011 to about 47,000 in 2014 -- had any impact on the shooting increase last year. 

I'd say most of this article supports, rather than refutes the conclusion reached by Washington Post. 
  




 Vote for Scott Walker -  because you don't want any rights or protections at work !!! 




 They're going to get their instructions and [boilerplate legislation](http://www.prwatch.org/news/2015/02/12743/wisconsin-introduces-verbatim-alec-right-work-bill).  




 Walker might even have trouble carrying [Wisconsin](http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/scott-walkers-wisconsin-approval-rating-drops-in-latest-poll-b99482677z1-300128921.html). He hasn't been doing himself any favors back home recently, and while Wisconsin skews right in off year elections (when he won his elections), it skews left in Presidential election years, when people like Tammy Baldwin get elected easily. 




 He should. It would give him a good cover for some of his more inane pronouncements.  "I'm sorry I said that, but I was totally baked". 




 I wouldn't be surprised if he got that many, or close to it.  Progressives in Wisconsin are a bit keyed up by events over the last 6 years or so. Also it's Madison. 




 With his wife?  I'm guessing they had either a very short or a very solid marriage. 




 For me , it was mostly just listening enough to get familiar with his music. Some years ago I had a long commute and and old car with a broken radio.  I had a copy of Free Jazz in the car, which I though was OK, but pretty strange. But for the entire week I kept forgetting to bring another cassette out to the car, so I probably listened to Free Jazz nine or ten times , and by the end of the week I couldn't remember why I'd thought it was weird.  

The analogy I use for Ornette Coleman (or other forms of outre music) is to compare it to painting.  If you went to a museum and were expecting to see realistic visual representation and found yourself in a roomful of say, Jackson Pollock and Paul Klee, you'd probably think.  What is this crap, these guys can't even draw.  But if you spend some time with it , you realize they've decided to take the art materials and do something completely different, something with it's own logic that is completely different from representational art.  I think Ornette Coleman more or less reinvented jazz music, the way some visual artists reinvented painting.  (Don't take this analogy too far or it starts to break down.)  




 That was probably a good rule. Some years ago I was on a business trip in San Antonio and was at a place across the River Walk from Dick's.  Some of the patrons at Dick's  were dressed up as giant condoms and most of the rest seemed unsteady and boisterously drunk. At eight o'clock in the evening. On a Tuesday. 




 I think Jindal is not seriously running for President. I think he's auditioning for a Fox News commentator spot. 




 Can't they both be right? 




 I have matches !!  Go ahead, take 'em.
 




 No one wants to live in a country where the government coerces people to act in opposition to their conscience.

Such as being forced to pay taxes for an illegal war in Iraq? 




 Dale Knapp, research director for the nonpartisan Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, said the states current budget woes are in great measure self-induced. Walker and Republican allies in the Legislature gave themselves no cushion for error in their bet that broad tax cuts would jump-start the states economy and more than pay for themselves.  When the new projections didnt materialize, we put ourselves into a hole, Knapp said.

Tax cuts pay for themselves - the conservatives most enduring fantasy.   









 Indeed, the reasoning is flawless and the sourcing is thorough. 




 Or some gun owners might decide to join up with the invaders. Can't say it will or won't happen, but groups deciding to side with the invaders has happened often enough in history.  




 In explaining the weighting of categories, to some degree, Minnesota benefits from a trend that we have sought to reflect in our study this year, the network said. Rather than just seeking the lowest taxes or the highest incentives, companies are increasingly chasing the largest supply of skilled, qualified workers.

So, the quality of your employees is more important than low taxes and  wages?  Hey Walker , Brownback , Jindal , et.al  - You're doing it wrong! 




 Judicial tyranny in this context means 'a decision Mike Huckabee disagrees with'. 




 A juvenile, yet completely accurate comment. 




 They were named after a song by [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6UMtWi5rX0), who was a pretty good songwriter himself. 




 Scott Walker 2016 - Hypocrisy without Limits 

I'm seeing a campaign slogan here

 




 I think the mono-culture started breaking up earlier, in the 70s.  I don't remember any radio stations playing, oh say , David Bowie, P-Funk and the Doobie Brothers. Although I would have listened to one if they did. 




 It's a subtle difference, but ISIS is destroying ancient and irreplaceable archaeological sites, which is not quite the same thing as objecting to the display of a replica of of a 19th century flag.  But  anybody could get those two mixed up.  




 A bit rich, coming from the guy who [stated](http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/in-film-walker-talks-of-divide-and-conquer-strategy-with-unions-8o57h6f-151049555.html) his strategy against unions was to "divide and conquer". 




 A small price to pay to protect their freedoms! 









 And don't forget about [this problem](http://www.vox.com/2015/6/22/8824579/lancet-comission-climate-change). 




 Hey Matt, right now Rand Paul is at [20/1 odds](http://www.paddypower.com/bet/politics/other-politics/us-politics?ev_oc_grp_ids=791149) to win the Presidency. Why don't you put your money up and collect on a big payday? 




 Scott Walker - the billionaires' best boy.  




 Blaming the poor - a political trick that never seems to fail. 




 Unfortunately, that attitude is limited to neither high school or Reddit. 




 I'm guessing that they want an excuse to go on a fact finding trip someplace warm. 




 Deciding when a citizen needs to be denied his rights and removed from society is one of the most important decision a government makes, and a corporations profit or loss should not be a part of it. 




 Sometimes, like in the quote above, I find myself cheering Paul on, thinking "Someone is finally showing some courage and making sense". And other times, say when he presented his tax plan, I think "This guy is dishonest or an imbecile".  Does Rand Paul have this effect on anyone else? 




 Ted Cruz , always a master of [good taste and timing](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/03/ted-cruz-joe-biden_n_7507284.html). 




 But illegally sold or obtained. 




 And Scott Walker will be telling us that ISIS is trembling in fear because he busted the school teachers unions. 




 I'm really looking forward to Paul Rand and Donald Trump exchanging ideas at the next Republican debate.  




 It's a bit [more complicated](http://www.factcheck.org/2012/12/gun-rhetoric-vs-gun-facts/) than that. 




 Straw purchases and corrupt dealers seem to be the most common ways for criminals to obtain guns. Stolen guns are less common. [Source](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/guns/procon/guns.html) 




 Or for that matter, how many crimes are committed using a gun that don't involve killing the the victim? Intimidation with a gun can work both ways.

Edit:  Found one [source](http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/GUIC.PDF) for the information, although it's pretty dated. But 20 years ago, 
 According to the Victim Survey (NCVS), 25% of the victims of rape and sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault in 1993 faced an offender armed with a handgun. Of all firearm-related crime reported to the
survey, 86% involved handguns. 




 And to complete the insult, Walker is handing out [free money to 'job creators'.](http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/state-jobs-agency-gave-loans-credits-to-firms-without-financial-review-b99523031z1-308521291.html) 




  itll be interesting to see how the Catholic GOP presidential candidates react to what is basically a searing indictment of their entire worldview. (Dibs on the campaign slogan Debris, Desolation   Filth: Vote Republican.)

They'll handle it fine.  What's one more bit of hypocrisy? 




 I think there's another reason.  Admitting mistakes requires some emotional maturity.  




 What I want to know is what it will take for Brownback to admit his 'experiment' has produced negative results? 









 And Scott Walker wants to [take it away](http://www.politicususa.com/2015/03/28/wisconsin-eliminating-weekends-koch-idea-nation-slave-labor.html).  




 Gun violence is the US is [eight times higher than in Canada. ](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/depending-how-advanced-is-defined-obama-was-right-about-gun-violence-2015-06-18). They don't have the same problem as the US has. 

 




 John, John, John. Putting the needs of your constituents ahead of ideology?  It's simply not done.  




 Seems to me the Pope wants us to be less greedy and more concerned about the inadvertent harm we cause the world's poor by warming the planet?  Wouldn't we be better people if we did that?   




 I like to imagine a big sign on the border greeting the tourists from Illinois.  Visit Wisconsin's lakes and woods!  Now with more toxins and pollutants! 




 Not to mention this [one] (http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/scott-walker-wont-comment-on-camerons-disputing-statements-b99521441z1-307893591.html). Walker is really a lying sack of cheese curds. I don't think he'll hold up any real scrutiny.  




 I'm with you there.  Some of his pieces could be used for audio torture (Einstein on the Beach) and some of them (Aknaten and his [String Quartets](http://www.amazon.com/Performs-Philip-Glass-KRONOS-QUARTET/dp/B000005J35) ) are  among my favorite pieces of music. 




 Absolutely.  I try to up vote people who disagree with me if they're making a genuine contribution to the discussion.  (Although I'll admit I don't always live up to this standard.) 




 It's just like the Nazis treated the Jews in Germany before WWII ... because the slightest imposition on or criticism of conservatives is always just like Nazi Germany. 




 She's certainly no Bernie Sanders, but compared to what we'll get if Scott Walker and Paul Ryan are free to reshape the laws and economy, ... shudder. 




 I particularly like the quadrant graphic, showing how Clinton is trying to get the voters to perceive her.  Wealthy doesn't mean you serve only your own class, and coming from modest circumstances doesn't prevent you from being a toady to the rich. 









 Hillary is lame. It it's scandals you want, [Scott Walker](http://scottwalkerwatch.com/) has accomplished a lot more in just a few years as Wisconsin governor.  




 Making it harder on the poor and easier for the rich. How all these putative Christians legislators justify their actions is beyond me.  I'm almost certain Jesus said we were supposed to the opposite.  




 Walker has left a trail of slime a mile long.  His history of corruption and dishonesty really needs to become national news.  




 One truly stunning thing about Coleman was how many years he made great and innovative music.  His brilliant album, The Shape of Jazz to Come was released in 1959, and the Pulitzer Prize winning Sound Grammar came out in 2006, 47 years apart.  Who else, in any genre, made great music for 47 years? 




 Indeed.  But we sure were fortunate to have him for as long as we did.  Coleman was one of the most important musicians/composers in jazz history, on the level with Armstrong and Parker. 




 Sound Grammar. Coleman's great late album.  




 Republicans do prefer strong leaders. 




 Eventually, they'll figure out that the party that's concerned about the 'job creators' will do nothing for the 'job holders'. 




 As he watches the early days of the Republican primary unfold, he sees candidates speaking out on poverty and showing compassion, a departure from previous cycles, particularly 2012, where he recalls many candidates forgetting the conservative heart.

And I'll bet he said it with a straight face. 




 They won't find a better puppy to server their purposes then 'Scottie' Walker. 




 Wisconsin has a large tourist industry and this can only help.  'Visit Wisconsin's great outdoors.  Now with more toxins and pollutants!' 




 Hound Dog Taylor.  Because I imagine your uncle could use cheering up and nobody in blues was more fun than the Dog. 




 And the economic value the University of Wisconsin brings to the state?  Somehow Walker never seems to mention it. 




 Here's an idea.  Legislators should put their duties to the electorate ahead of their pledges to a lobbyist.  Think it will catch on? 




 Well a real fox preys on "birds and small mammals like squirrels, rabbits and mice. A large part of the red fox's diet is made up invertebrates like crickets, caterpillars, grasshoppers, beetles and crayfish." . That list of animals is a pretty good metaphor for the Fox News audience. 




 Then I'd guess you'd agree that Walker's promise that his policies would create 250K jobs in Wisconsin was also asinine. 




 Privatization is the slipperiest form of crony capitalism.  Obscene payments under the guise of providing a service.
 




 50%.  I don't believe I've ever heard anyone state the number is that high. Perhaps you could show us your calculations. 




 While Fox News is busy [smartening everybody up](http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/05/28/donald-trump-for-president-why-billionaires-candidacy-is-no-joke.html) on the crucial events. 




 Interesting.  How much of your money is spent on those items? 




 The conservative view on government funding is: There's always a reason why 'those' people shouldn't get anything, but my need is different and deserving.   




 I'll bet Paul Ryan (R-Wis, and head of House Ways and Means) is still saying his supply side incantations. It's not going away quickly.  




 I was thinking more along the lines of buildings or statues. 




 [Eric Dolphy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cimpUKVAbY8). Ought to be more memorials to him. 




 I think Rubio just wrapped up the surrealist vote. 




 The most rigorous research study availablepublished in 2011 by the nonpartisan Economic Policy Institute and conducted by Heidi Shierholz (now the chief economist of the U.S. Department of Labor) and Elise Gouldcontrolled for 42 variables. **It found that right-to-work laws result in lower wages and a lower likelihood of health care and pensions for union and non-union workers.** It also shows right-to-work laws have no impact on economic growth.

Working as planned, I'd say.
 









 I do wish more people realized the number physical and economic problems lower class parents face.  You can read a lot of twaddle written by respected columnists (especially one named David Brooks) about how their problems are caused by moral failings or inability to plan long term and misses the obvious issues in the lives of poor families . 




 Christ almighty, is there anything more short sighted than skimping on education?  Hey Repubs, you want America to be able to compete in a globalized world?  You want an economy that can support you in your retirement?  No? Well then you're on the right track. 




 Rep. Craig Gagnon (R-Abbeville) is now my favorite Republican. 




 I wasn't intending any criticism of your business. I don't anything about landscaping business in Texas (or anywhere else for that matter.)  I was pointing out if that for Americans, working in landscaping is probably an OK job (better than fast food or other service jobs), but for some one on a visa, especially someone without much education, it's probably one of the better opportunities they'll have. I'd be surprised if the visa laborers didn't take the job more seriously.  It's a good chance for them and losing it would probably cause them more difficulty.  




 That's why I said if you were able to pay 20.  My point is that the quality of American worker you get for 10/11 isn't going to be the top shelf, and  if you compare them to immigrant workers, who are probably some of the more ambitious people in Mexico, American workers are going to come off as lazy.  




 Here's an idea, let me know if it seems to match up with your experience.   For 10/11, you're probably not getting the best people in the American labor pool. But for the visa workers, 10/11 is much better than they'll earn at home.  Hard working people from Mexico want these jobs. If you were able to pay 20 an hour for laborer jobs, I would guess you'd get all the competent hard working Americans you'd need.
Edit: Grammar and clarity 




 I don't think people should be down voting this comment. Asking me to back up what I said is a useful contribution to the discussion.  




 I'd say this headline sums up most of what you need to know about what's wrong with the American economy and justice system. 




 All these fact checking news sites have their flaws, but you don't get these kind of [ratings]( http://www.politifact.com/personalities/scott-walker/) when you're adhering strictly to the truth.
[And this one.] (http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2015/02/04/scott-walker-wants-to-drop-search-for-truth-from-the-university-of-wisconsin-mission-heres-why/) A drafting error? 
While this is a [highly partisan site](http://www.alternet.org/story/150170/20_of_the_biggest_lies_told_by_wisconsin_governor_scott_walker), and you may want to discount some of it's claims, most of them are properly sourced.
Not to mention his dishonesty about his intentions. His signature issue, Act 10 to eviscerate public unions, somehow didn't get mentioned during his first campaign during governor.  Or that his intention was to [divide and conquer](http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/in-film-walker-talks-of-divide-and-conquer-strategy-with-unions-8o57h6f-151049555.html)  Wisconsin's unions.
 




 They shouldn't. The guy is a lying sack of cheese curds. 




 And expand slavery into the western states.  




 Actually it was more a spend and don't tax situation. The high tax and high service model can work, the low tax and low service model can work, but the high services without taxes to support them fails every time. 




 Not to mention that Wisconsin's income inequality is [growing faster](http://host.madison.com/news/local/writers/mike_ivey/wisconsin-income-gap-widening-faster-than-nation-as-a-whole/article_acc8a776-a0be-11e3-a5f1-001a4bcf887a.html) than the national average.  




 Yet virtually ever Republican in Congress voted for it.  Makes you wonder about their judgement in other matters, doesn't it? 




 Walker would like us to believe that the state's dismal economic performance on his watch is everyone else's fault. He's blamed Jim Doyle, Barack Obama and Mary Burke among others 

I never understand why politicians can get away with this.  They make ludicrous promises (Walker promised his policies would create 250K jobs) and when they fail to deliver, it's everybody's fault but their own.  Arrant puerility, and it's coming from people who are leading the country. 




 Funny how all the right wing pundits who blame the poor for their lack of morals never get around to addressing this sin. 




 It's not just Fox News . Slagging an unpopular groups (i.e. people of African descent, native Americans, immigrants) is an old and unfortunately effective play.  




 Apparently they blame Obama for the gaps in the law's coverage.  Some people just can't be wised up.

He and his wife dont blame the state for not expanding Medicaid, or themselves for waiting until illness struck to sign up for insurance. According to Helms they blame President Obama and Congressional Democrats for passing a complex and flawed bill.  




 But the [money thrown away](http://legis.wisconsin.gov/LAB/reports/15-3highlights.pdf) by Walker's Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation? Fuggedaboutit! 




 Anyone who criticizes America's economic system must be a socialist. Or a communist. Or maybe even a realist.  




 Here's a [link](http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/DC-Decoder/2015/0303/Wisconsin-going-right-to-work-What-s-the-impact-for-jobs-and-incomes) for anyone who'd prefer a more balanced discussion of RTW. 
























 Witte said one problem for the workers is that employers could take advantage of the provision and subtly coerce workers to "volunteer."

You forgot the beginning of the quote. 




 Why do employers need the ability to make people work seven days a week?  Is it really to their advantage? 




 Reason magazine seems to do smugness pretty well itself. 




 Apparently the man has a rich sense of irony. 




 "I thought it was important to put the focus on the job creators," Walker said.

Jesus, are people still falling for this bunco routine? 




 Apparently, Cruz thinks this is something to be proud of. 









 Scott Walker 2016 --  Because you don't want any rights or protections at work 




 Finally, the scourge of ethics has been eliminated from Wisconsin government.  
Edit: Missing word 




 If that's true, it sure [sucks](http://blackdemographics.com/population/) at it. 




 It's the real weenies who feel the need to talk tough. 




 Perhaps because there was a lot of news involving the Confederate flag? 




 I don't get it either. Dick Cheney is at least as repulsive as Donald Trump. 




 The more Scott Walker campaigns, the more he proves he is not intellectually fit for the office hes seeking. He asserts innocent ignorance on matters he should by now know something about  a way of masking his apparent bigotry. 

I don't care much for Richard Cohen, but he's got Walker figured out pretty well. 




 Puts him [tied with Dick Cheney](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/01/politics/campaign/01CHEN.html).  




 But Marco Rubio is ready.  But don't take my word for it. Just ask Marco Rubio. 




 Why not. Fox pretty well runs the Republican Party anyway. 




 Off is the default position of Trump's filter.  Assuming he has a filter at all. 




 OK, how about the world's greatest living troll? 




 It was over 10 years ago. Maybe he thinks hypocrisy has a statue of limitations. 




 The fact is, were a nation of laws, Walker said. 

When will Walker or any other pandering nativist talk about the importance of enforcing the law against employing undocumented workers?    




 Good, cause I'm enjoying the ride. 




 I support a free enterprise system unshackled from bad regulation and big labor unions  which were the right thing for American workers in 1890.

And in 2020.  Maybe Jay will come around on that next. 




 We should let citizens carry guns when they go to meet Presidential candidates.  Why do the second amendment advocates put up with this intolerable restriction? 




 Judging from how many conservative Christians act, you'd think Jesus told us to berate and denigrate the poor and suck the asses of the wealthy.   




 Absolutely, when one these 'secure the border' clowns addresses the issue of employers of illegal immigration, I'll start listening to them. 




 Or we could give equally derisive names to other candidates, like Scottie "Dog" Walker. 




 No, but I promise you can look forward to convoluted arguments about why this liberal Pope's pronouncements don't matter and the pope should stay out of politics . 




 The Congressional Research Service found that the vast majority of unauthorized immigrants do not fit in the category that fits Trumps description: aggravated felons, whose crimes include murder, drug trafficking or illegal trafficking of firearms.

I don't disagree with the idea that we'd be better off with less illegal immigration. But it sure seems to me he's exaggerating the criminality of illegal immigrants in some rather heated language. And he's ignoring another group of criminals. The most frequent crime involving illegal aliens is employing them.  Somehow I rarely hear these secure borders advocates talk about cracking down on illegally hiring immigrants. Seems to me fewer employment opportunities for illegal immigrants would do a lot more to reduce their numbers than any wall on the border. 




 How about [this stuff](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/wp/2015/07/08/donald-trumps-false-comments-connecting-mexican-immigrants-and-crime/)? 




 So if you want to spew hysterical anti-immigrant racism, looks like you don't need to worry about Scott Walker criticizing you.  









 I wonder why the author omitted [this statistic](http://www.jsonline.com/business/wisconsin-ranks-35th-in-us-for-job-creation-over-walkers-first-term-b99520739z1-307884841.html). 




 My salary or Donald's?  
 




 The enemy of my enemy is my friend. Go for it, Donald. 




 Esa es una buena broma, Esteban.
 




 Move over Chicago.  Wisconsin is going to show you how real political corruption works. 









  Trump isn't running for President, he's putting on the most widely viewed absurdist art performance ever.  




 Fact checking Donald Trump seems like a pointless undertaking.  




 And for those trying to play gotcha by pointing out that some of what she said differed from ideas that prevailed when her husband was president, well, many liberals have changed their views in response to new evidence. Its an interesting experience; conservatives should try it some time.

They do learn. Unfortunately, what they've learned is that bashing immigrants and less successful citizens and toadying up to the wealthy is a viable election strategy.  









 Trump-ism not conservatism but a toxic mix of demagoguery and nonsense.

But a toxic mix of demagoguery and nonsense is working pretty well for Scott Walker! 









 Doesn't mean we can't enjoy it while it lasts. 




 Of course , Walker loves Kohl's.  A business that blackmailed Wisconsin into tax subsidies and pay its cashiers less than $9 an hour is the perfect example for his economic vision. 




 It's hard to believe, but not too long ago Wisconsin had a reputation for squeaky clean government.  Walker and Fitzgerald have got that turned all the way around. 




 A greasy half-truth from Scott Walker? Get ready for many more, America. 




 The base eats it up? Check. 




 The title is the best one sentence description of our current election I've read. 




 Because unfortunately, laws are always selectively or irregularly enforced. (We could go a long time without an income rate increase if we hired enough IRS agents to truly investigate our richest Americans.) In immigration, there are too many people who have a stake in keeping things as is, so the law enforcement is underfunded and desultory.  




 The ones against entering the country or the ones against hiring people who entered the country illegally? 




 The guy who just called Hillary Clinton [Desperate, Sad]( http://dailycaller.com/2015/07/14/donald-trump-responds-to-desperate-sad-hillary-clinton/) is a Democratic plant?  Carlos, would you explain how that fits into your conspiracy theory?  




 Why are these GOP weenies always so eager to go to war? 




 Are they furious enough to punish the employers who hire illegal immigrants?  Not likely. 




 I think Rick Santorum's only priority at the moment is getting someone to pay attention to him. 




 Something that would help the people who earn the least is 'a really lame idea'.  Looks like you picked the right party Scott. 




 He's just sort of making up employment numbers, I'd say. 









 Except Wisconsin didn't have a 3.5 billion dollar deficit.  At least not if you're [using the calculation Walker favors, now that he's governor](http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2015/feb/13/scott-walker/did-scott-walker-flip-flip-budget-shortfall/).

 So, the Koch Brothers are putting $900 million into the election and Jeb Bush has raised $114 million, but somehow jobs supporting Republican candidates pay $1000 a month.  But they're going to make things better for America's workers.   




 Start with Scott Walker. Please. 




 OK, then I'm sorry for the citizens in Maine who didn't vote for this clown and need to live through his administration.  Us Wisconsin progressives understand all too well. 




 If that's true, then [this guy](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/10/us/billionaire-lifts-marco-rubio-politically-and-personally.html) is going to want his money back. 




 Fun while it lasts ... but remember Herman Cain was leading the polls for a while last time. 




 I feel sorry for the citizens of Maine ... but I hope they can take some solace in the entertainment their governor provides the rest of us. 




 It's taken awhile, but they're starting to [wise up](https://law.marquette.edu/poll/).   




 I hope Walker runs on his 'accomplishments' in Wisconsin.  Scott Walker - Ending Wisconsin's tradition of fine public education !! 




 Where he will be joined by [zero](http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/07/07/republicans-2016-hopefuls-to-skip-la-raza-gathering-of-latino-activists/) Republican presidential candidates.  




 Once all the good teachers are gone, we'll hear about how Kansas schools are failing and they need to privatized.  




 I guess we'll have to agree to disagree about how badly our elections have been compromised by money. 




 He scares me a little, and I can't help but to notice that the more his opposition hates on him, the more support he gets, due to this deeply seated democratic hatred for his haters, and what they stand for

[Maybe not](https://law.marquette.edu/poll/2015/04/16/marquette-law-school-poll-finds-walker-job-approval-down/). Although he may coast into the White House under of a barrage of right wing money.  God help us all then. 




 There are two issues with Walker's election victories. First, there's the [two electorate issue](http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-07-09/why-rubio-jeb-walker-and-kasich-are-not-as-purple-as-they-look).  Conservatives do better in off year elections.  Second, money obviously plays a big role in elections (why else would politicians spend so much time chasing it), and Walker has received millions of dollars of out of state support.  He was elected as much by ALEC et, al as the voters of Wisconsin. 




 That's less than $2 for [every US casualty](http://costsofwar.org/article/us-and-allied-wounded) in Iraq and Afghanistan. A bargain! 




 The 11th-hour additions include a repeal of wage protections for construction workers on local government projects, the elimination of workers right to one day off per week, ... Another change made over the Fourth of July weekend eliminates the states long-standing living wage law and replaces all references to a living wage with minimum wage.

Scott Walker for President! Bringing you fewer rights or protections on the job! 




 What I can't understand is why anybody would want to subject an audience to speech by George W. Bush, let alone give him a $100,000 for it. 




 On the upside, as long as Brownback is preoccupied with this nonsense, he's not  fucking up Kansas's economy even further. 




 That will work out to about 2.50 per citizen in Oregon. I'll bet they can handle it. 




 We'll see more of this and eventually it will become the norm.  The US requires a more educated workforce and high school isn't enough. With unions being eviscerated, we're losing the apprentice program, so community colleges will need to provide the skill training. 




 He is the only bluesman to have his music [launched into deep space](http://www.vox.com/2015/7/7/8906867/scott-walker-immigration).  




 I wonder if he'll feel the need to [retract](http://www.vox.com/2015/7/7/8906867/scott-walker-immigration) that statement soon.  




 And that invalidates all the other evidence and arguments for the existence of climate change?  How?
 




 I don't care to defend anyone's bad behavior. But how does this incident refute all the evidence that climate change is occurring?  




 Are you talking about [this incident](http://www.factcheck.org/2009/12/climategate/)?  




 Or perhaps it's only common knowledge inside your echo chamber. 




 Source? 




 And Walker, Rubio, Bush, etc.  They're not conservatives, they're merely dogsbodies for the wealthy.  




 I'm looking forward to AEI's article on how outrageous executive compensation affects prices. 




 Might work. I'd like to ask them if they want to dispute the current scientific consensus in astronomy or germ theory.  




 Not to forget [this conversation](http://host.madison.com/news/local/writers/steven_elbow/british-prime-minister-david-cameron-i-never-told-scott-walker/article_65cb00ae-94fc-5850-b6d3-aa6fa374bf71.html) with Scott Walker either.  Odd how this keeps happening to Walker, isn't it? 




 The GOP's usual M.O.. 




 On Sunday, after three days of pressure from Mr. Walkers aides, Mr. Moore said that he had misspoken when recounting his call with Mr. Walker  and that the call had never actually taken place.

He had misspoken and the call never took place anyway?  Of course it's not like Stephen Moore had any integrity to lose. 




  A review of documents of the ruling obtained by International Business Times showed that the study saying the $7.25 minimum wage was adequate in meeting living wage standards was largely **based on findings provided by the restaurant industry in the state**.

Scott Walker for President -  Prosperity through Lower Wages
 









 Source? 




 Right, so let's elect someone named Clinton.  Seems the economy works better than we elect someone named Bush. 




 Hey Alex and Matthew, while your at it, why don't you tell your old man his economics are bullshit?  Or call him out on his corruption or lies?   




 I'd prefer to think of him as a bought and paid for toady. 




 Walker is running as corrupt a political machine as you'll find in America.  
Edit: Couple of links for sourcing.

 No where in the article is there a quote from the CBO saying the economy is in a death spiral.  However there is a quote from the House Budget Committee chairman saying our national debt is spiraling out of control.  That kind of reporting would get you a C- in your Intro to Journalism class.  Oh, and no link to the report, just links to other Washington Times articles.  Guess they don't want to make it easy for anyone to fact check. 




 Cruz already has gathered support from other ultra-rich backers, including the billionaire hedge fund manager Robert Mercer. Mercer and two others seeded a pack of spending groups called Keep the Promise, allowing Cruz to reveal a $31 million haul in a single week.

Man of the people, that Ted Cruz.  




 Because Minnesota and Wisconsin are relatively similar states that  had elections in 2010 and followed very different paths, with very different results.  It's about as close to a controlled experiment as you can have in American economics. 




 Only when you compare it to a Republican run Wisconsin 




 Which side has a track record of trying to do something (not very much, but something) for the middle class?  Which side would you trust do address income and wealth inequality? Which side realizes that humans are contributing to climate change? If you say the Republicans, (or these issues aren't important to you) go ahead and vote for them.  Assuming we don't get Sanders, I'll take my chances with Clinton. 




 Everybody gets a turn leading the Republican primary polls. Herman Cain was leading some polls at one point last time. 




 I always remember this John Kenneth Galbraith quote when making political decisions. 

Politics is the art of choosing between the disastrous and the unpalatable.

Am I thrilled by the backers of and all the choices made by the  Clintons and Obama? Of course not. Would I take take them again over another Bush or Scott Walker, etc?  Absolutely.
 




 Everything really. Wisconsin used to be known for clean government and great public education.  Scott Walker has turned that around. 




 I don't want to trade. Do you? 




 More than a third of the firms $33 million in proceeds from 2007 to 2013 came from banking giants Lehman Bros. and Barclays, which paid Bush a combined total of about $12 million for his work as a senior adviser.

Who's interests do you think he's going to look after if he's elected President?  Yours? 




 I have two issuesv with your argument.  'Many Republicans like Rand Paul' doesn't consist of very many Republicans.  Only a [dismaying small percentage](http://www.businessinsider.com/10-percent-of-republicans-think-climate-change-is-human-caused-2015-7) of Republicans believe that climate change is caused by humans. Secondly, 'strong capitalism' isn't going to fix climate change by itself.  If you want a market based solution to climate change, you need to provide some incentives, some way to profit from addressing the problem.  There was support for that among republicans in the past (solutions like cap and trade), but it's virtually non-existent now. 




 In 1998, Walker championed the Truth In Sentencing Act, a bill that would go on to become law, star in that constituent newsletter and create an approach to imprisonment critics said would later balloon the states prison population and lead to severe racial disparities in the prison population.  .... A 2004 Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel investigation found the law would cost Wisconsin $1.8 billion dollars over 25 years and bring prison spending to par with the states university system.

See what Scott Walker has done for Wisconsin - think what he can do for America. 









 If I were comparing them I would have written a statement like 'Although Obama drew 30,000 for a speech at the height of the election, Sanders was able to draw a crowd 1/3 that size for a speech 16 months before the election.'  I was pointing out that Madison speeches draw huge crowds. If Clinton comes here, I wouldn't be surprised if she has a larger crowd than the 5500 she drew in New York 




 I thought your 'two ways to look at it' hardly covered all the scenarios of people working many hours.  Notice I amended it with an 'Or' statement.  




 Or they have meaningless low pay jobs and need to work 2 or 3 jobs to survive.  Or they have "supervisory" or non-exempt jobs and are forced to work extra hours because their employer would rather squeeze them than hire extra employees. You have a rather optimistic view of how employment works for Americans on the lower end of the pay scale. 




 Hey Scott, since you're suddenly concerned about environmental issues, you might want to take a second look at climate change. 




 This early polls are as much about name recognition as support.  




 Sure is, I almost bought one myself. We seem to go through car trends in my neighborhood.  First we all had Saturns, then suddenly there were Priuses everywhere, and now it's the Fit.  




 They're not meant to be comparable, just to demonstrate that if you're a Democrat Presidential candidate, Madison is good place to get a large crowd for a speech.
