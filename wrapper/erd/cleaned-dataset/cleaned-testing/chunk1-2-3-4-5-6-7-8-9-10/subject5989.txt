 link? 




 Thanks for sharing, looks awesome :). Mine is your typical 4x4 :( lol 




 Hey guys, I love Rust. Primarily base building. However I'm not too great at making something that looks awesome. Anyone care to share what theirs looks like? Or know of any sites that show how to guides etc for sweet base layouts? Thanks :P 




 fuck that, did it on normal already 




 Would love to see decklists :) 




 Thanks for the info! Bought it today and played a little Altis Life xD. Although I had no idea what to do lol 




 When you go to multiplayer do you simply type in Altis life or you need a specific server address to type in which then downloads the appropriate files? I've been waiting to get this for like 6 months I'm praying its on sale today! lol 




 Waiting on the 50% off too, was so sad when it lost the community vote lol :(. Need to play that Altis life 3. I heard it's built right into the game now so you don't need to download anything additional is that true? 




 It worked, thanks! 




 Any ideas people? I can't even use the "ESC" key.

 How is it restricting you? Pick any state and then google Zip codes for the state of whichever you have chosen. 




 no proxy, im in Canada. I made an amazon.com account. used my canadian credit card and just put in a random US address. 




 I can confirm as long as you make the account on amazon.com and put in a bogus US address it works. 




 To each their own, he asked for a script not your view on botting. 




 Well feel free to share lol, I only started playing Sunday night myself also. So we're both newbies. 




 So this works within the steam version of the game? Are you able to do other things while this is running or are you stuck in that active window like you're typical auto clicker? Thanks. 




 Does this also do ascensions to farm souls? Would love if you posted this script. I've been using a simple auto clicker, can't find any script that works with the steam version of this game unfortunately. (Just started playing a couple days ago). 




 OMG. Thanks for making me hungry and sad all at the same time. Nothing like this around me sadly :( 




 That's awesome, good work. I'd love to be a co-admin if I could find people looking for one, or at least have unlimited resources.. Would like to be able to build and improve on my design skills. 




 wow nice, this was before the stability stuff existed? Don't see how the tree stuff is possible. Also were you an Admin? tons of mats for those id assume. 
























 Although I like all of them I think I'm still leaning towards DGM. White and Blue are awesome but they're so overdone, literally everyone has one of those two colors. 




 Nice! I'm in Ontario too :D 




 I'm about to purchase a 16' STi Sport and can't decide on the color. I have it down to WRB, White, or DGM. I'm leaning towards DGM but not 100% sure yet. What do you all think? 




 Was also wondering, how much were the protective measures you took at the detail-er if you don't mind me asking?   




 Is this the DGM? Been debating what color to get for my STi. This really makes me lean towards your color lol 




 My Impreza is white, does the fact that the interior is red/black bother you? lol. I'm down to either white, blue or DGM. 




 My current Impreza is Satin White and I love it, although it gets dirty so easily  




 I normally don't like blue but the STi is an exception, really speaks to the Subaru heritage. Although the black/red interior makes me OCD run wild as it doesn't go with blue at all IMO lol 




 glad you got it working :) 




 congrats! I'm picking up one myself soon. Still can't decide between wrb or white. 
























 Yeah I love the STi just I really want a fully loaded vehicle. Would be really tight getting the fully loaded STi  




 That's what I've been thinking, can get it fully loaded whereas I can't afford a fully loaded STi. Although I will miss the STi badging (which I can live without I assume). Will really miss that big wing on the back (wondering where I could find one for the WRX and how much it would cost me) lol 




 Gorgeous, should be illegal to get an STi without that big wing though :P 




 Shout out to Sauga boys! 




 Oh there is a car in the picture? ;). Yeah the ride is pretty sweet too! 




 Congrats, still debating between WRX or STi 




 Absolutely gorgeous, congrats! 




 Thanks for sharing, I'm in a similar situation. Big into gaming but have been wanting to get back into shape. I was 165 my whole life pretty much (I'm 6'0). Now I'm up to 212 and hate looking in the mirror. I got a fitbit and have discovered MFP which I've been using for the last 3 days or so. I've just been eating right and going for daily walks. I would like to get back into going to the gym to get a body like yourself but I have no idea where to start. What foods to eat, what exercises to do at the gym, do I write them down etc etc. Any help would be greatly appreciated! 




 I hate the lapis blue lol, if I were to ever get blue it would be the WRB or that new blue they unvieled. :P 




 I never thought of it like that, thanks for sharing your POV and enjoy the new ride! 
























 Yeah I've been looking at the M235i xdrive, really nice car also. 




 What would it be if you wanted an AWD sports coupe? 




 I didn't even know that, thanks for sharing lol. Maybe the BAZ coming soon? ;) 




 Congrats! Been considering trading in my 14 impreza for the 16 wrx 




 damn, this should be under NSFW 




 haha awesome man :) yeah here the sport model has everything except no leather, no nav, no push to start, and no bbs wheels. sport-tech package has it all. although its like $30 more BW 




 Yeah I wish we didn't have so many options lol 




 Thanks for the links man! 




 I'm in Canada, there is 3 different models for the STi. Base, Sport, Sport-Tech 




 I don't even know popular subaru forums to be honest lol (I'm in Canada) 
























 This would be my daily driver, I'd still want to do a bunch of mods to push the HP over 300 for sure. Track every once in a while for fun perhaps but definitely not serious tracking or autox. 




 Yeah I feel you on this, I do love that god awful wing on the STi though so I would be sad not having one lol 




 STi is more expensive, although the WRX isn't an STi I think things like leather and push to start would be cool to have. Not to mention with the money saved I could still go crazy with all the cobb parts I want lol. Thanks for the input 




 Where can you find cool car themed rearview items like that? I've always been looking! Lol 




 I've been deciding on colours also, heavily leaning towards DGM. Looks amazing in person and is the best colour for always looking clean :) 




 Why can't desperate and single girls like this call my phone?  




 Congrats, inspirational transformation! 




 You gotta be kitten me! This is so damn cute :D 




 ohh alright, Infiniti is nice but for the price I'd much rather drive a BMW 




 I always thought that was RWD but I could be wrong. 
























 I'm glad you got my reference lol. *DONG* 




 SHAME 




 I'm in love with what you've done here, congratulations!  




 My Birthday is July 28th and I've been fascinated with Astronomy for as long as I can remember :)  




 All females? Prove it! 




 Yeah I think I agree with you, as hard as it is to wait I probably should for the STi to release a new engine. I feel like that will be for the 2018 model though, *sigh* :( lol 




 I have tons of these all over the front roof of my car also. 14 impreza sport hb white. nothing you can do just buy the pen and fill er in 




 yeah I suppose, just a fan of leather, push to start, nav, sound system, spoiler. If I can get it already with all of that then less work for me. 




 Doesn't even HAVE to be STi wing, could always get something different I just see some wings costing a couple grand and definitely not spending that much on one lol 




 If I were to get a WRX why not fully loaded? It's not going to be able to compete with an STi so might as well have some comfort if I'm sacrificing not getting the STi lol 
























 I guess you wouldn't mind coming to Canada to help me out with my rims? I'll buy you a case of beer? lol 




 Want to be friends?  




 Are there places that do this type of thing? I'm very unhandy and I live in an apartment so I don't have any space for something like this lol 




 How'd you do those? Looks amazing. 




 Do you go out to restaurants often? I'm in Toronto and I've never seen Nachos without it to be honest. 




 Lettuce is extremely common, no idea what part of Canada you live in because I'm Canadian too lol 




 You should be head of marketing for Chipotle good Sir. 




 and? 




 This makes me sad, if I were in charge of things the majority of the worlds budget would be going towards space exploration! :D 




 Can't get hyper blue in Canada yet, waiting till then to upgrade my 14 Impreza 
























 You thought wrong little one. 









 SMOrc 




 Colorado I can understand due to the snow, but Seattle? They rarely even get snow lol. I'm not complaining though, the more Subies the better :D 




 amazing! hardly any where I live lol 




 I may be moving to Seattle in December from Canada, glad to see some Subies out there :) 




 What would it realistically sell for do you think? 




 I am near Toronto! We are friends indeed :D 




 This is so many levels of awesome. 




 Is it really worth that much? 
























 Thanks man, and congrats! Hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoy mine :) 




 Pretty much, a bit of a homemade slaw and it's actually a cilantro aioli :) Toasted bun lightly brushed with melted butter also 




 Was pretty good thanks for asking, I've been eating super healthy the last month so my body was craving something like this lol 




 Birdie. 




 Nice, fellow Ontarian too :P 









 As a fellow Canadian also, thank you for the greeting. Hope you're having a great day :) 




 lol, it's fast enough for me...for now. I don't track or anything so I can't complain. 




 thanks man, yeah definitely not the car if you want something really fast lol 




 SubieFlow is a page that I'm a big fan of, didn't know I needed a turbo to sport one of their decals lol 




 The Crosstrek is a very cool ride. However, so is your '13 so be sure to enjoy it. Anyone who owns a Subaru is bound to have a blast regardless of the model! 




 Gives me +10 HP 




 lol thanks! 




 Thanks, much appreciated. I wouldn't mind a WRX or STi someday but this does the trick for the time being :)
