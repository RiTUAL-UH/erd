 Sorry if this isn't the right place to post this, but I have some vinyls I've gotten from my grandmother and would love to listen to them, but I don't own a record player. I don't even know where to start and what to look for. Can someone help me find a good starter record player for under $150? 




 Okay, so I made a [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hwb6k/what_are_some_good_movies_to_show_to_a_group_of/) a few days ago looking for help figuring out what movie to watch on our movie night. 

After looking at the comments, and comparing them to the movies I actually own, I've put together a list of seven movies. However, I can't decide which to watch. In the original post, I talked about what my friends liked. "They don't like slow paced movies and would rather not watch a drama unless its interesting and has good pace. They like just about any genre but would prefer either a horror, comedy, action or any combination of those. I think above all though the thing that matters most is if its interesting and has good pacing. I don't want to bore them. I showed them There Will Be Blood once and I could feel the awkward boredom in the room."

The List: Pulp Fiction, Event Horizon, Fight Club, Children of Men, Dredd, Crank, and Se7en.

So which of these would be the best crowd pleaser? The one everyone would be most likely to enjoy? Which is the easiest to get into, no matter what kinds of movies you like? 














 Looking for a great sci-fi horror movie to watch. I love sci-fi but I also want to be horrified, terrified, grossed out, etc

Any ideas? 




 So me and some friends are doing a movie night Friday and I'm trying to figure out what to show. 

A little info on my friends. They don't like slow paced movies and would rather not watch a drama unless its interesting and has good pace. They like just about any genre but would prefer either a horror, comedy, action or any combination of those. I think above all though the thing that matters most is if its interesting and has good pacing. I don't want to bore them. I showed them There Will Be Blood once and I could feel the awkward boredom in the room. 

Also I'd prefer something that didn't come out in the last two years. Thanks guys!

I watched this not knowing what to expect and was immediately drawn in by its animation style. Tells a very interesting story about a selfish morally corrupted man who one day wakes up with wings on his back. I was really amazed by not only the animation but also how it tells this story with no dialogue. It even gets a little Cronenberg-y at some parts. Definitely give it a watch.   




 Lets fantasize for a minute here. Lets say that there is no way it will be bad. That they will get everything right and it will do justice to the original show. That it will without a doubt be great. 

And I'm not talking about a remake of a show. I'm talking about a sort of continuation of the show. I'm talking about something like the Rugrats Movie, Simpsons Movie, Serenity, and Arrested Development. 

So what tv shows would you like to see get a movie? 




 I mean he's so good with creature effects and Pacific Rim sort of reminds me of Power Rangers in a way. Just a thought.  




 For example, I hope Aaron Paul makes the jump to film because he's a great actor that should get more roles.  




 Saw White House Down then I went to a casino and I was wondering what games have levels that take place at a casino or the White House? 




 I really love the Mardi Gras level in Hitman Blood Money. It was probably the first time I saw that many NPCs in one level. 




 What are some really good flying games for this current generation of consoles?

First time posting here. My friend and I decided to challenge ourselves and see what we could come up with in only 24 hours. Would love some feedback. We loved our idea so much that we'd like to make a full length film of it some day so, criticisms, tips, and suggestions are more than welcomed! 




 I'm really interested in seeing this but I can't find out where it's being released at. On my local theaters website they have a list of movies they'll be showing up to middle August but Only God Forgives isn't listed so I'm assuming my local theater isn't showing it. 

Anyone know where it'll be? 









 I'm not talking about a movie being turned into a stage play. What I mean is, what if the movie was shot as a musical.  




 I have some khakis that need altering.  




 I love Nine Inch Nails and think they're great, but even if they weren't great, Nine Inch Nails is such a cool name. 









 Also what items are they? 



















 So my friend got me into World of Tanks and while we were setting it up we started talking about the voice chat in the game, or any pc game in general, and thought it be cool to have some sort of voice modulator software, where whenever we talk, people hear like a delocated, super low voice. For example, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage v=YlxxxXz4T-s#t=16s)

So my question is, is there any software that can do this?

Again, if this isn't the right place, please tell me where I can ask this, thanks, guys! 




 Loved Just Cause 2 and was wondering if anyone's said anything about it at E3 this year. 




 [Picture](http://imgur.com/yrLLfCQ)

My friend is moving away this week and I wanted to give her a photo of all of us. The problem is that it was taken on an iphone so it's super fuzzy and grainy and the quality isn't that great.

Could someone improve the coloring to make it less yellow and more "natural" looking? Also is it possible to make it clearer or less grainy? Just an overall better looking picture?

I really appreciate any help. We just want our friend to have a nice picture of all of us all.

Edit: Thank you /u/screwball2 and /u/braceyourself87 these are great! I really appreciate it! 




 I'm talking about some not so well known directors that have only done a few movies, or they can even be well known directors that make movies every so often.

My pick is Gaspar Noe. Dude makes great movies, but he's only done a few and hasn't made one since 2009. 




 Me and some friends are going to have a movie night tonight. We want to see something sick and disturbing. Almost all of us, including me, are very squeamish so we thought it'd be fun to be grossed out.

I wanna know what the most disturbing, gruesome and grisly gore you've seen in a movie is. I'm not talking about someone getting shot and blood sprays out. I'm talking head crushing, bone breaking, gut spilling out sort of things. 




 What scene of violence or gore in a movie has made you cringe the hardest? 




 I watched Kill List recently and really liked it. I liked how it starts off pretty standard but as the movie progresses, things start getting darker, stranger, and more evil.

Are there any other good movies that start off pretty standard, but throughout the course of the movie things just get darker, more evil, more insane, stranger, and just all out worse? 

Like the protagonist is totally sane at the start, but throughout the movie he experiences things that get increasingly unsettling, violent, dark, and evil and by the time the movie is over he is a different, emotionally and mentally broken man. Anything like that?

Edit: Requiem for a Dream is a good example of what I'm talking about. 




 I'm looking for some good mature adult graphic novels. But not mature as in violent or gory. Mature as in language and subject matter. Basically an R rated comedy in graphic novel form. Something funny, but also very adult and mature. Anything that fits the bill? 




 I can't remember the title. It was something along the lines of "Getting drunk in front of the movie theater" or something like that? It was about a young adult girl? I read a little bit of this novel a while ago and liked it but don't remember what it was called.  




 I'm looking for some graphic novels to read that are realistic. As in, they're about real, normal people. Not super heroes. Not zombies. Not monsters. Just regular average Joes or average Janes. 

One of my favorite graphic novels is Daytripper. It's about a guy and his life from his childhood all the way to his adulthood. No superheros or supernatural stuff. Just a guy and his experiences in life.

Or some good heist graphic novels, or cop novels, detective novels, war novels, or even just novels about a person or group of people. Basically graphic novels about people who aren't superhuman. They're just like you and me.

As much as I think superheros are cool, I'm just fascinated with human drama. Human interactions. Human problems.

I hope I explained well enough. If you need more details and information about what I'm looking for, just let me know. 




 What are some great graphic novels that aren't well known? 









 Also, what would you do?

I choose link karma instead of comment karma or combining the two because it'd get ridiculously high.

Mine is 1961, so I guess it'd be interesting. 




 It was a post withe the title "Whoever wins this game..." or something like that. It was about a game that drops you into google streetview and you have to make your way to an airport. Tried looking for it but it seems like the post just disappeared. Anyone know where it is or what game it was? 




 When people talk about funniest movies, they tend to talk about movies made in the 20th century. So what do you think are the funniest movies of the 21st century? 




 I'm getting sick of long hair and since it's summer I'm thinking of getting a haircut. But I don't know where to go. I know MHA says to stay away from places like Super Cuts. So where should I go? Salon? Barber? Hair studio? What kind of place is best to get a good stylish and fashionable haircut? 









 It can be a character, too. Just any famous person or character. 




 I was looking for a vinyl of The Fragile and someone mention they heard there was going to be a repress of it? Is this true? If it is, when? And if it is, does this mean I can finally get The Fragile vinyl at a reasonable price?

 I'm working on losing weight. I have a diet set up and I'm starting to run. However, I know that weight lifting is an important part of losing weight and getting in shape. So my question is: As someone who can't afford a gym membership or weights, what is a good substitute for weights? A box of books? What DIY stuff can I bench press or curl? 




 Basically what mom and/or dad from a movie or tv show would be cool to have? Why? You can mix and match mom and dads from any movie or tv show to make awesome combinations of parents if you want.  




 Everybody's bashing the new Xbox talking about, "Oh it looks like a VCR! Hurhur!" But I actually think its kind of sexy. I like the simple sleek design of it. It seems like its built for efficiency. And besides, when it comes down to it, the look of the console is near the bottom of the list of things that matter. 




 What do you consider a must see movie simply because of what they achieve or do on a technical level(music, camera work, sound, cgi, effects, cinematography, etc.)? Regardless of how good you think the movie actually is in terms of acting or writing or story. 

For example, Enter the Void is a movie many would consider bad or boring and not that great. However, I think it's a must see purely because of what they achieve with the camera work and cinematography.

Also, Avatar. Many like it, but there are also many who don't think it's that great and has a bland story and average acting, but I also consider it a must see because of its groundbreaking effects.

So what movies do you think are must sees from a technical standpoint? 




 So yeah. People tell me it's great, but have never told me why. All they say is, "It's great man. Just give it a shot." "What's great about it?" "Just watch it."

So no one as ever really argued for it or given me reasons why I'd like it. I like fantasy stuff. And I appreciate a great story with great characters. But I have a hard time looking past the fact that it's animated and about kids.

But like I said, no one has ever given me reasons why I should watch it and what makes it great. I want to check it out, and I'm open minded,  but I can't convince myself because I know nothing about it. So, change my view. 




 So I've been trying to convince my mother to watch this show for a while now. I know she'd love it because she loves these types of shows. But she won't give it a chance because it's animated and that automatically makes it a "little kids show." So can you guys help me develop an argument to convince her to at least give it a shot? How did you convince someone you know to watch it? 




 Disturbing or terrifying videos/audio recordings are welcomed too. Basically things that just don't sit right with you and you find unsettling. 




 As someone with social anxiety who's also super shy, this situation makes me want to die. 




 I have social anxiety and this situation makes me want to die.  









 It takes me about three months for my facial hair to resemble anything close to a beard. Is there any way to speed this process up? Rogaine on my face? Anything? 



















 Basically a subreddit where people post awesome fan made trailers and mashups. Combining other trailers. Also creating tv show intro mashups. 




 I hate Betty White. But it's not her fault. It's everyone else's fault. She so overrated. Everyone's like "OMG Betty White is the funniest person! She's the greatest! She's so much win! I love her so much!" Honestly she's just humorous. Don't get me wrong, she's a kind person. But I absolutely hate that everyone goes nuts for Betty White. It seems like whenever she's in a movie or show, it's only so the producers can be like, "Look we have Betty White! We're relevant!" 

She's everywhere just for the sake of being everywhere. And her show Off Their Rockers is kind of bad. I guess I don't hate Betty White. She nice and fine. I just hate the absolute over hype about her.  




 Okay so I saw this anime movie a long time ago and I've never seen it again. I have no idea what it was called or what it was about. In fact I didn't even see all of it. I only watched one part and have been wanting to see it ever since.

The scene I saw involved a man and a little girl. There was also a cyborg like woman attacking them. This was in like the near future I believe. So the cyborg woman attacks the man with some sort of hand blade thing. I think. But the man holds up his hand and the blade goes through his hand and stops right at his eye. It was also raining I believe. And this took place within a skyscraper I believe. Please identify this! It's been haunting me for years! 




 I've played a lot of Skyrim. I've seen almost all it has to offer. It's really starting to bore me. What are some ways or challenges I can do to make it interesting again?

Edit: I'm on 360. 




 I'm 19. One friend who works all the time and when he's not working, he's with his girlfriend. So I never hang out with him. 

Weekends suck because I always spend them alone. 

I mean, I have many "friends" but we never hang out. I only have one real friend. I always invite people to stuff but they rarely accept. 

I'm a nice, funny, caring guy. What's wrong? I just want to enjoy my life because I don't know how long I'll be alive, but its hard to enjoy life alone.

I have some friends who frequent Reddit. A few know my username. So if anyone who knows me sees this, don't let me know that you've seen this.

 Thanks for listening, everyone.  









 What song do you think has the best singing you've ever heard? 




 Saw this movie a while ago. Can't remember title for the life of me.  





























 Didn't know where else to put this. I just want to see it get made. The creator has said that The Jungle Movie, the next and final HA! movie, was suppose to be the last movie. It would've answered all sorts of things like what happened to Arnolds parents, what happens between him and Helga amongst wrapping up  the stories of all the other kids. [Here's an interesting article](http://tendraheyarnold.wordpress.com/2009/03/28/confirmed-notes-about-the-jungle-movie/) where Craig Bartlett, the creator, talks about the unmade movie and what would've been in it. 

It saddens me that this might never be made. I just need closure! 




 So what movies have made you cry just out of the sheer beauty of it? I watched To the Wonder tonight and there was one part where I started crying because of how sweet and beautiful it was and all I said was, "It's so beautiful!" as I was crying. 














 My friend asked me if I knew anyone who could photoshop. I don't so I came to you guys. [Here is the pic](http://i.imgur.com/X6vv7ju.jpg) he wants edited. [Here is what he wants edited onto his glasses](http://i.imgur.com/wVvYJtW.jpg) as if it were reflected onto his glasses. Sort of like [this](http://i.imgur.com/pfxg80W.jpg) for example. Thank you so much for your time! 














 First off I wanna say that I don't hate this movie. In fact, I really liked it a lot. However, it didn't meet my expectations. I think it might have been too over hyped.

Before it came out I saw some reviews that said this movie was incredible and it was the bloodiest movie ever made. Now while it WAS bloody, I felt only one scene was super bloody. I was expecting every death to be crazy amounts of blood everywhere. Also, the trailers were absolutely incredible and did and amazing job of hyping me up. And finally the poster. The poster said "The most terrifying movie you will ever experience." That tagline made me believe I was about to see a remarkable piece of horror.

And the movie wasn't really that scary, it was more just violent. I was expecting to not be able to look at any of the deaths, but it was actually pretty easy to watch. I felt more grossed out watching the original Evil Dead. Now, again, I still really liked and enjoyed this movie, but did the marketing over hype this movie? Or was this all my fault because I set my expectations so high?  




 Going camping in a week. I wanna put together a playlist of some good camp fire music. You know some good accoustic stuff. Stuff that sort of have the feel of someone sitting at a camp fire with a guitar playing. Maybe not just accoustic. Maybe some nice mellow stuff. So what do you guys think should be on this playlist?

What I have on the playlist so far to give you guys an idea

Over the rainbow - Israel Kamakawiwo'e

Guaranteed and Society - Eddie Vedder

 Are there any fictional movies like Samsara in terms of cinematography? It's one of the most breath takingly beautiful movies I've ever seen and I'm curious if there are any other movies that aren't documentaries that have similar cinematography or even similar thematic elements.  




 Who decides what commercial to show and when? How do they decide this? Is it random or on a playlist? How do commercials come on automatically?  












































 So I have a lot of money and I wanted to spice my game up by giving my character an overhaul in terms of his looks. The problem is I don't know what to change and how to make him look. I need inspiration. You think you can post a screenshot of your character? Show your character off! Maybe one of your awesome characters will inspire my new character. I'm just not really creative and my character's super generic. Thanks! 



















 Okay so I watched 500 Days of Summer and it kind of reminded me of Blue Valentine in that it was sort of a story about the rise and fall of a relationship told in a nonlinear fashion. I want to see some more movies like this.

So, are there any good movies about the rise and fall of a relationship? Movies where you see the beginning and end of a relationship? It can be about the relationship between husband and wife, girlfriend and boyfriend, between friends, parent and child, etc., any relationship told in either nonlinear or linear fashion. It just really fascinates me to see how a relationship progresses from two people getting to know one another, to loving each other, then to see it start to crumble and eventually fall. Blue Valentine is one of my favorite movies, but it's also one of the saddest I've ever seen. Thanks! 




 So I want to get Operation Flashpoint but don't know which one to get. So simply, which is better(mechanics, gameplay, graphics, difficulty, fun, etc.)? 




 First off, sorry if this post doesn't belong here. If it doesn't, please let me know where to put it, thanks!

I can't decide which show to watch so I came to ask you guys. Basically, which show should I watch? Which is more worth my time watching? Thanks! Note: I haven't seen any of these shows before.

* Arrested Development

* Lost

* Mad Men

* The Killing

* Archer

* Twin Peaks

* Hell on Wheels

* House of Cards

* Bob's Burgers

* Parks and Recreation

* It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia 

* Louie

* Alias 




 I'm new here and just wanted to say hi. 









 Okay so I've only played like three quarters of Mass Effect 1 and stopped because my game was messing up so I never went back. Recently I've been wanting to play a Mass Effect game. The only thing stopping me is the fact that I'm like two and a half games behind and don't have that kind of time to play both Mass Effect 2 and 3 on top of finishing the first one.

I listen to a couple of gaming podcasts so I kind of know what happens in all of the Mass Effect games and kind of know what's going on. So I want to get Mass Effect 3. My question is: Is it a good idea to jump in the third one without finishing the first and not playing the second? Will I know what's going on or get lost? Also, should I get ME3 or ME2? I've heard from almost everyone that ME2 is better, but I'll only have time to play one of them so I figured I'd get ME3 because it's the last one. Basically, which one will give me the better experience(better mechanics, story, fun, stuff to do, etc.)? 









 [How does these kinds optical illusions work](http://media.log-in.ru/i/3dstereo_2.jpg)? How are they made? I don't get it. 




 What's your favorite song that was written specifically for a movie?

Mine's probably Down to Earth from Wall-e. Yours doesn't have to be a Disney song, though. 



















 So I was driving and some nut turned in front of me and scared me to death. My heart skipped a beat. Then I thought, what happens in your body when that happens? What causes it? What's going on? 









 Like, if I saw a man who weighed 125 lbs I would think that he looked gross and unhealthy and like a skeleton. However, when you see a woman who weighs 125 lbs she looks healthy and normal? Why do women look different than men who weigh the same?  




 I've been out of high school for almost two years contemplating what to do in terms of education. I've always known what I wanted to do: Film. So after tons of reading and thinking I've decided that I want to be a professor of film. And in my free time I'd work on my film. So my question is what classes did you take to be a professor of your chosen subject? How long did it take? 




 So this documentary is fantastic. It's basically interviews with big filmmakers about digital vs film. Really interesting! Definitely worth your time. 

[Here's the link for it on Netflix](http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Side_by_Side/70239473?trkid=2361637) 




 Also, who are some actors/actresses that don't deserve all the work they get and should be getting less roles?

My pick for actor that should get more roles: Jared Leto. He's good in everything he's in, but I don't see him enough. Runner up: Ben Foster

My pick for actor who shouldn't be getting as many roles as they do: Adam Sandler. He's a funny guy with good acting chops, but he hasn't made a quality movie in a long time.  









 First off i want to say that if this isn't a good place to post this please tell me a good place to post it. So I play Skyrim on the Xbox and I've put a ton of time into it and have a high ranking character, but eventually I want to get a pc. I wanna add mods to it. However I don't want to have to start from scratch. So my question is, is there any possible way to move my character profile from my Xbox to my pc? Could I import my save somehow or somehow create a fake save? Anything I can do? 









 I've applied at nearly 100 places within the last 4 months. I've been unemployed for about 8 months. I'm about to go to college and need a job, but haven't been able to get one for 8 months despite the fact I apply to multiple places a week. I mean, I don't even get a call. I never hear from the job, so I have no closure about if they even saw my application or not. 

This upsets me because I've been searching for 8 months, however I have friends and family members that got jobs after looking for only a couple of weeks. And we have the same amount of qualifications. What gives? How come the people who actually need and want a job and have been looking forever seem to stay unemployed? And the people who don't need a job, but want one just so they'll have money to buy material objects they don't need seem to get jobs easy? This blows. 




 First off I want to say that I'm not sure if this post belongs here, and if it doesn't, please let me know where it goes, thanks.

So I got a speeding ticket today. Why does this piss me off? Because I've only sped twice in my life counting today. Both times I've gotten a ticket. And both times unintentional. I know a bunch of friends and family that speed on purpose all the time and never once have they gotten pulled over! Why me? This blows! 

Also, I was ONE mile away from my house! 




 Hey guys. I'm pretty new here and have some experience with guns but I have a question. I just bought a used leather holster. It was made for a S W 659 but it will hold any pistol of the same size because it's not specifically molded for the S W. So what are some other pistols the same size and dimensions as the S W 659? Thanks for the help! 









 What are some movies where a person or group of people travel across a country (any country) and they experience the various natural wonders and beauties of mother nature as well as various cultures. And even meet some strange people along the way? Something in the vein of Into the Wild or Wild America? Not a documentary though. An actual movie. 




 I'm looking for movies that are epic, but not epic as in huge. I mean epic as in the movie spans across a vast amount of years. Something in the vein of Bicentennial Man. Or maybe Forrest Gump? 




 What line or quote from any movie or tv show is your favorite? Feel free to post links to videos or pics of the quote. 




 What exactly are electronic cigarettes and what makes the different and healthier than regular cigarettes? 




 There was a game I played a lot in either the late 90s or early 00s. It was an internet based game on a website. I mostly played it in the computer lab. It had to do with a fox I think? It had multiple levels. Each level was a different puzzle I think? One of the levels had you bouncing a bubble with another bubble. You had to keep the bubble in the air and it couldn't touch the ground. Again, it has to do with a fox. I think it might have had the word "fox" in the title or url. Please help! 




 What scene from a movie was serious or not meant to be funny but had you laughing hard? 




 I saw the Fast and Furious 6 trailer during the super bowl and it got me thinking. I remember the first Fast and Furious way back when it was just a small crime movie about an undercover cop in the street racing world of a California city. Now it's evolved into international heist/race action thriller taking place in world locations with huge action. Not that I'm complaining, I just find it interesting how this franchise started as one thing and has changed into something else entirely different. 

So, what other movie franchises or tv shows have started as one thing and turned into something else entirely? For better or worse? 

**EDIT:** I'm no talking about what franchises stated off good and ended up bad. I'm basically saying what franchises or shows have basically changed genres. Example: The Fast and Furious used to be a small crime movie and is now an over the top international action movie.  




 Hey I'm new here, but I love writing. Was wondering what you thought of my short story. Give me some constructive criticism. [It's called NDE](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0By3l0nVnUv1hU0t4aEFRc3pWTVk/edit) It's a working title. 




 Hey guys I'm new here and also started collecting last summer, so I thought I'd post some pics of my collection so far.

1. Memphis/TN/USA

2. August 4

3. Anything mind-bending

4. Probably Charlie's Angels

5. Mission Impossible 2

6. In the Name of the King

7. Either Christopher Nolan, Terrence Malick, or Zack Snyder

8. The Thin Red Line Criterion Collection

9. Kill Bill The Whole Bloody Affair

10. Alphabetical

11. IMDB?

I'm planning on adding to my collection frequently, but here's what I have so far.

[My collection so far.](http://imgur.com/a/6DTiI)  




 I saw the Impossible and it's one of the best movies not only of the year, but in a while. It has incredible effects, acting, and directing. So why is it basically non existent at all these award shows and top ten lists? How come this fantastic film is getting no nominations at practically any award shows and getting hardly any recognition from critics and columnists? I've seen tons of websites and magazines talk about what they think are the best films, but no one mentions the Impossible. What gives? 




 Out of all the years the Oscars has been around, what do you think is the biggest snub in Oscar history? 




 I saw Zero Dark Thirty on Friday and I was thinking this is such an American movie. But, is it the most American movie? Probably not, but what do you guys think is the most American movie ever made? 

Also, if you had to pick a movie to represent America and what America is, what would it be? Like what movie embodies best what America is? Like, if you gave an American film to a foreign person in order to show them what America is really like and what we're all about, what film would that be? 




 Pretty self explanatory. I would love to see a sequel or prequel to the Iron Giant. So, Reddit, what is your pick? Also, what would it be about? 




 Also, what would they be? They can be anything. Your relative, sibling, friend, your dentist, your teacher, local cop, weather man for your local news station, etc., etc.. They can be anything! Anything! 




 Guys, we've already seen posts about what were the best movies of 2012 and the best cinematography and best performances of 2012. But what do you guys think are the best scores of 2012? Or best soundtracks or best original songs of 2012? I really loved the scores for Samsara and Dredd because they really captured the mood and feeling of those films. But what do you guys think are the best? 




 Hey I'm looking for a show. It was a Japanese game show that came on G4 and I loved it. It was a show that had a ton of extremely difficult obstacle courses. One of them was had people unicycling along super thin platforms and hopping upstairs. That's the only obstacle course I can remember right now. Please help! 




 Hey guys. Recently I've had an urge to play a game with good tactical multiplayer. Something along the lines of Spec Ops from Call of Duty(best example I could think of). I want something they relies heavily on tactics, communication, and teamwork in order to win/complete objectives. It can be co-op, online or offline, doesn't matter. Or even player vs player/team vs team. I don't really care what genre it is either so long as it's good tactical multiplayer/co-op. Thanks, guys!

Edit: Preferably console games. I don't have a decent pc. 














 Hey guys and gals. I was playing spec ops: the line and noticed in the settings that you could change the filter on the game to change the look of it. This reminded me of red dead redemption. In RDR, you could change the brightness and contrast and make it as vibrant and colorful as you want, or as desaturated as you want. You could even make it black and white if you so desired. I thought this was an awesome feature as it allowed you to tailor your game to the look and feel that YOU wanted. So my question is are there any other games for consoles that allow you to change/adjust the color/contrast/look of the game?  




 Hey everyone! Listen, I'm pretty new to photography so I need some help looking for a good wide angle lens. I have a Canon EOS Rebel T3i. My budget is preferably no more than $150 and the most I'll absolutely go is $200. Also, how reliable is ebay for buying lenses? Thanks for all the help! 




 I was wondering if you guys can suggest a movie that will make me cry. I'm a guy and I've seen a lot of movies, but none have made me cry. I hear people all the time talking about a movie they saw that made them cry, and I want to experience that. I want to see a movie that affects me so much on a personal/mental/emotional level that it makes me cry. I don't really know why I want to experience this other than the fact that I haven't ever experienced it. There are a few movies though that have brought me close to tears such as Requiem for a Dream and Lion King. I would say it takes a lot to make me cry. I mean I cried when my golden retriever died and I cried when my grandparents died, but that's basically it. A friends son past away recently and I didn't even cry (I don't mean that in a proud way). I mean sure I was sad, but I didn't cry. So I think it has to affect me on a personal level. So can you guys suggest a movie so incredibly sad and depressing that if it doesn't make me cry then there's something wrong with me? 




 So I'm having family photos done tomorrow at around noon. It's going to be outdoors. I live in Tennessee. What should I wear? I'm going to go shopping today. I'm looking for some jeans and a shirt and possibly a jacket. So, generally speaking, what colors/patterns should I get? What kind of jeans/shirt should I get? If I got a jacket of some sort, what kind should I get? It's a pretty casual shoot. I really want to look nice because these will be the last photos of us for a good while. Thanks guys! 




 So I want to start off by saying I'm sorry if this isn't a good place to post this, but it seems like it belongs here. Also, I'd like to say that yes, Nathan Fillion would be the perfect Nathan Drake, but I think we can agree that it won't happen unfortunately. Now, the person I think should play Nathan Drake is Bradley Cooper. Hear me out. The guy is a pretty solid actor. He can be funny and he can be serious. He also has the physique to be able to handle a role like this. The guy's got star power! This is just my opinion, but what do you guys think? Every time this topic comes up, Brad Cooper's name isn't even mentioned.  









 Okay so you know how at the end when Joe sees Sara get shot and the screen's all gold, and Joe says he saw everything, a mother die for her son, a man kill for his wife yadda yadda yadda. Then he says something about how the loop is closed or something like that. I think it should have ended there implying that he caused Cid to be the man he grows up to be, and the events in the movie will repeat itself forever, therefore creating an endless "loop". I think that's how it should have ended. I think it would have created a bigger impression and been a better ending. But this is all just my opinion. 




 I don't know if this goes here, but here I go. I want to know why so many pc users relentlessly hate on Apple products. I'm not trying to start a flame war or anything. I want to have a serious discussion about this because I am genuinely curious. Like when my friend (who hates Apple and loves pc and Android) comes over and I say my iphone or macbook is acting up, he says it's "because Apple made it." I've asked him what his problem with Apple is before and he has never given me an answer other than "because Apple sucks." In fact, most of my pc friends react this way. So in an attempt to get valid reasons why people who use pc and Android tend to hate Apple, I've come to you guys for answers. Again, I'm not trying to start a flame war. I just want some insight on this issue.  




 I saw a movie either in the late 90s or early 00s where a guy transformed into a woman (I think only at night?). I think when he was a woman he had black hair, but I'm not sure. I remember one scene where he was a woman and some guy (with glasses?) was trying to sleep with him/her. Again I'm not 100% certain on some of these details. 









 I ask this because in order to make one, they will have to reboot Batman again. Plus they will have to reboot Superman again because this new Man of Steel (based on the trailer) will be like Batman and won't allow a way for other DC heroes to exist in its world. In my opinion, I would rather have a great Batman series, Superman series, Wonder Woman, Flash, Green Lantern, etc. if it meant that there wouldn't be a Justice League movie rather than have crappy movies of these super heroes just so a JL movie can happen. So how badly do you guys want a JL movie? Bad enough to have crappy super hero movies just to have your JL movie? Or would you rather continue having great super hero movies if it meant there would be no JL movie?  









 Hi, I'm new to Reddit and relatively new to photography. I have a Canon EOS Rebel T3i and would like to start taking pictures of things like insects, plants, eyes, and other small things. What kind of lens should I get? What should I look for? Like I said, I'm relatively new to photography so I don't know a lot of the terminology, so could you please answer as if you were talking to an amateur. Also, if you could maybe suggest some lenses, that would be helpful, too. Thanks you guys for any help you can give!
Also, any tips for macro photography would be nice! Not necessary, just nice! 





























 See I'm on both sides. Place Beyond the Pines and Only God Forgives are two of my favorites of the year. 




 But the thing about voice acting is, is that you can really only covey emotions through your voice. Some of the greatest acting performances are more than just saying things with words. It's also saying things with your body. Your mannerisms. You brought up Mark Hamill's Joker vs Heath Ledger's. Yes Mark Hamill's Joker is great, and I'd say probably more iconic, but what makes Heath Ledger's Joker incredible is his mannerisms. They way he walks, moves his hands, his body language, how he licks his lips. These are things you just cannot do as a voice actor.  




 Because I can think of a few actors/actresses that deserve to be nominated more than someone who did voice work. I understand voice work isn't easy, but it just wouldn't be fair to nominate someone who did a voice over instead of someone who actually was physically there. Physically acting with more than just their voice. Acting includes not just voice, but expression of the face and body. Some of what makes acting performances great are the subtle things they do with their face and body. 

Edit: I should clarify that I DO agree that voice actors should be recognized. What they do is incredible and not everyone can do it. What I'm saying is that *acting* acting and *voice* acting are two different things. They require different kinds of performances. Voice acting is about how you convey a character through voice while *acting* acting is about how you convey a character not only through voice, but through your mannerisms. They way you walk, move your hands, the way you look and so on. Things you simply cannot do as a voice actor.

It might be weird to segregate a Best Voice Acting category and a Best Actor category, but it makes sense. We have two separate writing categories: one for original screenplay and adapted screenplay. We have two separate Best Picture categories: one for animated and one for live action. Why can't we just have two separate acting categories? That way voice actors don't have to compete with *actor* actors. I don't think voice actors should be treated differently, but they do. Given a choice between a voice actor and an *actor* actor, the Academy will always choose the latter. Is it fair? No, but that's the way it is. If you lump voice acting in with Best Actor, they will almost always never get the award. They might not even get a nomination, but if there were a category for voice acting then they would get the notoriety they deserve every year. 




 What ever happened to Killer Crow? 




 We do agree but we don't. I agree with everything you've said, but I think where we disagree is the whole "good movies are good movies" thing, and I'm okay with that. I still think that as long as a movie is good, it's good. I don't care if it's a remake, or whatever. I'd rather see a really good movie that isn't the most original thing than an original movie that's bad. And that's just my preference. I'm not saying that all original movies are bad, in fact, some really great movies are original. But at the same time, there have been some really good movies that are remakes, sequels, prequels, reboots, adaptions or whatever. 




 You do realize I said basically the same thing, right? I never said anything about shot for shot remakes. 




 If this is true then this is sad. Good movies are good movies. It shouldn't matter if it's a remake, sequel, prequel or whatever. It's not fair to just write off a movie and give it a bad review simply because it's a remake, sequel, prequel, reboot of whatever.  




 Side by Side, Senna, Samsara, and Dear Zachary are incredible documentaries. Especially Samsara.  




 Are these legit reviews and is it really that bad or are people prejudging this movie? I haven't seen any reviews yet. This is a movie I'm really looking forward to and it bums me out to see it at below average because that means that it's either genuinely bad, or people don't want to like it and are hating on it. 

  




 So I'm making a Christmas sweater. [This](http://therightprofile.blogspot.com/2011/12/now-i-have-machine-gun-ho-ho-ho.html?m=1) one to be particular. My question is what should I use to write on it to achieve that clean, bright look? A sharpie? Paint? Or what? Thanks in advance!  




 So in English we watched a documentary called [Salute](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0874317/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1). You can read the story [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_Olympics_Black_Power_salute). Basically, my teacher wants us to write an argumentative essay about something from 1968, using the movie as one of our sources. I decided to compare the black power movement to the gay rights movement. So far all I have is a thesis statement, but I'm having a hard time coming up with points and how to structure my introduction paragraph.

My thesis statement also needs to be improved in terms of wording. My thesis statement says: "Racism in the 1960's was so strong, that it would have been better if it was a gay rights sign instead of a black power sign." I can't figure out how to word it though.

But I really need help coming up with arguments to support my thesis. Any help is greatly appreciated.

Tell us what is holding you up. 




 **Rock Band 3**: This is a game I never really stopped playing. I play it like every week. Man, this game is great. Definitely one of my all time favorites. So many songs. But as I was playing this past week I started thinking about if we'd ever see another Rock Band game. With the new consoles and everything they're capable of, it'd be interesting to see a next gen Rock Band game. But only if they allow us to import all the songs we've bought. I don't really know of anything they could do better in Rock Band 4 or whatever they'd call it other than graphical stuff and maybe allow us to upload our own music?

**Fallout 3**: This is a game I played when it first came out. Got to like level 5 and wasn't having any fun so I stopped. I guess it was because I had never played a game like it before so I didn't know *how* to play it. So a few years later Skyrim comes out and I try it and fall in love with it. Over a hundred hours of Skyrim later, and I decide to go back to Fallout 3. I am absolutely loving it now. I've been playing it so much this past week. I guess Skyrim was sort of a good introduction to that style of game, and because I was use to it, Fallout went from feeling so foreign to feeling so natural and fun. Now I'm looking into playing New Vegas, but yeah, Fallout 3 is so incredible. 




 No one will stop you. 




 That'd be a fantastic feel-good movie! 




 What does that have to do with anything? 









 300 - Prepare for Glory

No Country for Old Men - There are no clean getaways.

Cobra - Crime is a disease. Meet the cure.

Evil Dead - The most terrifying film you will ever experience. (Even though it wasn't, when that tagline was released it was so bold and got me so hyped.) 




 Brandon Lee's accidental death on the set of The Crow.

"In the fatal scene, which called for the revolver to be actually fired at Lee from a distance of 12-15 feet, the dummy cartridges were exchanged with blank rounds, which feature a live powder charge and primer, but no bullet, thus allowing the gun to be fired without the risk of an actual projectile. But since the bullet from the dummy round was already trapped in the barrel, this caused the .44 Magnum bullet to be fired out of the barrel with virtually the same force as if the gun had been loaded with a live round, and it struck Lee in the abdomen, mortally wounding him. He was rushed to the New Hanover Regional Medical Center in Wilmington, NC where he underwent 6 hours of surgery. However, attempts to save him were unsuccessful, and Lee was pronounced dead at 1:03pm on March 31, 1993 at the age of 28. The shooting was ruled an accident." 




 That's why I said "I'd". As in "I" would. 




 Things like cameras, tripods, lenses, mics, etc 




 Yeah I use to rent this movie like every weekend! I'd love to see it again. And thanks for the gold, it was so unexpected! 




 Lawrence of Arabia is fantastic, but I'd say 2001 owns the 60's. 









 It'd be funny though if they gave you the gold instead of /u/Vendredi8 




 Man, that movie's the sickest! 




 Don't they check your receipt at the door when you leave Walmart? 









 Hmm maybe he did mean Chang. I thought it was interesting though some of the similarities Julian and One Eye had. Like the fact that they both had one eye and SPOILERS!!!!! 

how Julian cuts open someone's stomach just like One Eye also how Julian was pretty much silent. 

But it could be Chang. One Eye was basically Odin and Chang is also God like.  




 I think its hard to say without knowing what you like, but Holy Motors is a truly strange and unique film. That movie is so strange and it just sticks with you.  




 I think Nicolas Refn hinted that Ryan Gosling's character in Only God Forgives is the character One Eye from Valhalla Rising reincarnated.  




 I don't know what it would be nominated for but The Place Beyond the Pines was great. 

Also regardless of what people think about Only God Forgives, that movie has some great cinematography and music.  




 Okay one more quick question. What does it mean by EA disk? Can I go to gamestop and find it? Is it easy to find? 




 That video makes it look easy. Is it as easy as it seems? I'm not great with computers. Also thanks! 




 How *do* you get custom songs? 




 Sorry? I couldn't find one on Amazon so I looked elsewhere and that was the only one I found. If people can find it for less that's great! I don't know why I was downvoted. I didn't pick the price.

I was just trying to be helpful :(

Edit: Wow first I get downvoted for trying to help then I get downvoted for apologizing. Real cool guys.  




 A weird question, but I was wondering if there were any songs that are similar to Nine Inch Nails songs from the album The Fragile. I know there are NIN songs available but none are from the Fragile. 

Like songs that are kind of epic style rock and loud? 




 Why not? 




 [Here](http://www.retrofestive.ca/grumpy-cat-jingle-all-the-way-to-hell-ugly-sweater/) 




 I think if it is real they revealed too much with the logo. If they wanted people to be guessing what it was they wouldn't have such a dead giveaway to fallout. That logo pretty much kills the surprise.  




 I'm looking for some good thanksgiving movies to watch with my family. It doesn't have to explicitly be *about* thanksgiving but it can also take place during thanksgiving. Just looking for some good movies that go with the thanksgiving season.  




 It's always kind of bugged me when actors complain about how hard their job is. I get acting is hard, I've done it before, and it's okay to say it's hard, but don't complain. You make millions of dollars. There are millions of people who would kill to be in your position. 




 Man this is sad to hear. I loved his music so much. 




 I actually think it'd be pretty cool to see "Wicked" versions of other Disney villains.  









 I love how people call it a dog game yet there are like only two parts where you use the dog. 




 Mystic River is absolutely fantastic.  




 Immortals. I'd recommend it to my friend who likes Greek mythology and loved 300.  




 That movie was the sickest! 




 I dunno man, if they collected phones at the beginning of detention I could still see it working.  




 In all honesty though, I feel like Breakfast Club is one one of those movies that *could* be remade like every thirty years to appeal to that generation at the time. The basic idea of that movie is timeless. There will always be kids, always be high school and always be detention. Just update the slang and fashion and BOOM! You have a competent and relevant remake that will always work.  




 It's totally fine to think the Dark Knight is one of the greatest movies. People get a lot of crap for thinking that, but TDK *is* a great movie. It's exceptionally well made, well acted and well directed. The only reason people say it can't be one of the greats is because it's new. But in like fifteen years when it gets "old" I think people will be okay calling it one of the greatest movies made.  




 Not really. A movie can be mind blowing or awe inspiring and still not be your favorite. Avatar is nowhere near my favorite movie, but it's something I'd love to see again for the first time. 




 Oh wow! This totally might be it. I'm about to watch some videos of it to find out for sure. But this might be it! 




 This isn't it. What bugs me is that I'd immediately recognize its name if I heard it.  









 So in this animated movie, probably early 90s, there was a talking puppy and a talking owl. Maybe more animals? And maybe in a castle? House? It's not a lot to go on but all I remember.  




 I thought the scene in Watchmen when a younger, less experienced Rorschach finds the pedophile. That was pretty intense.  




 Honestly though this should be the least of people's worries. This is a REALLY DUMB thing to complain about because it affects absolutely nothing in terms of games and hardware.  




 Honestly though this should be the least of people's worries. This is a REALLY DUMB thing to complain about because it affects absolutely nothing in terms of games and hardware.  




 Yeah, of all the things people complain about in terms of Xbox One, this is seriously the thing they should care about the least.  




 I'm right handed and I've always gotten disks out with my left hand. 

It'll feel weird on the left side at first but in a few months or so it won't be a big deal and people will get use to it I think.  




 I don't know the law well but can cops shoot me if I punch a bunch of people? I love fist fighting in this game but then the cops come and shoot me and ruin it :(

Also screw the cops that hang on the side of SUVs and box you in and shoot you to death.  




 Or a system that let's you explain yourself to the cops and be like, "Yo sorry man this was totes an accident!"

Or at least just get a small fine instead of it being either cops die or you die.  




 I always hate though how slowly you break into cars. You have to go through the entire "look and make sure no one sees me, bash window, slowly get in and slowly hotwire the car" animation. The cops are after you! They are shooting you! Don't check to see if they are watching you break in! Just smash the window, hop in and start it as quickly as you can!!! 




 Then box you in, preventing you from going anywhere then shoot you to death.  




 I feel like the only way to escape five stars in GTA V is either by train or underground tunnel.  




 I will say though occasionally there is that super awesome moment of suspense when you're hiding at the end of an alley and the cops walking towards you. Then right before they get to you, your wanted goes away.  




 I got five stars and went to Trevor's airstrip and got into a plane because it seemed like the only possible way to escape. It was a HUGE ordeal getting in the air. But once in the air I thought I was home free. Nope. Helicopters kept spawning in front of me. Gave up trying to lose them and just flew into a building and died. I'm not giving them the satisfaction of killing me. 

Someone summed up the cops in GTA V perfectly. "The cops in GTA V would murder their families if it meant killing you." 




 Mighty Morphin Power Rangers the Movie 




 I'm playing through Fallout 3 for the second time. The first time I really didn't enjoy it. I think it was because it was so different from anything I had played before that I didn't know how to play. So then I played Skyrim and loved it! So this past week I went back to Fallout 3 and I'm really loving it now.

So my question is, what's the word on Fallout 4? Has it been officially announced? Are there any details or leaks about it? The technical leaps Bethesda has made since Fallout 3 really get me excited about Fallout 4. If it's happening that is. Any info about it? 




 Looking for someplace that has pork buns.  




 Just what is your favorite tv show theme song or opening credits? 




 Looking for Christmas songs. Doesn't matter what the song is or who it's by. If it's Christmas themed, I want it. 









 I love movies where the main character(s) hallucinates and the line between whats real and fake becomes blurred. They lose their grip on reality for whatever reason. Like Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas or The Shining or Pi. What are some good movies like this? Movies where they hallucinate and lose their grip on reality and can no longer separate what's real and fake. 




 I'm looking for some good movies with religious undertones. Maybe movies about someone finding or rediscovering their faith in God. It doesn't even have to explicitly be about God, but someone finding or rediscovering their faith in a greater power. Maybe destiny? I'm thinking specifically like Terrence Malick films how they have beautiful religious undertones like The Thin Red Line, The Tree of Life and To the Wonder.  









 I love M83 and am looking for similar music. I'm mostly referring to their songs [My Tears Are Becoming a Sea](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLuc8vjny5c) and [Outro](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWdiaS3uq4) 




 I really love Nine Inch Nails' album The Fragile. I don't know what it is about it I like, but what are some other albums, artists, or songs with a similar style and feel to The Fragile album? 




 I really liked whoever opened up for NIN in Nashville but don't know who they were or what songs they played.  









 They don't even have to be your favorite ones. I'm just looking for some decent movies that are about Thanksgiving or take place during Thanksgiving. 




 I'm looking for a post that was on here. Although it might have been posted to r/pics. But I'm pretty sure it was posted here. 

It was a pic of a gorilla with a weird look. The title said something along the lines of "He gave me this look after I mouthed something" 




 What movie do you think does the best job at character development? Like fleshing out their characters to where they don't feel like characters anymore, but feel more like real people. A movie where by the end of it, you feel like you've known the characters for years and therefore feel a connection to them. 




 I don't watch horror movies so I've never seen any of these but I've heard good things about them. 

Inside

Martyrs

Rec (original one)

The Descent

Could you tell me which of these would be best to watch? Or if you have a better suggestion? Newer horror movies from like 1998 to present are preferred unless you know of an older one that still holds up well. Like I said, I don't frequently watch horror movies so I don't know which are good.  














 I feel like it's been a while since we've heard anything regarding it. Anyone know when it's supposed to be released? I know Volition said it was going to be released close to the games release, but it's already October 9th. 




 Anything from clothes, mannerisms, and everything in between. 









 Is there really even a point to wearing a mask in single player free roam? I remember before the game was released they were talking about masks and made it sound like Red Dead Redemption. Like you would go into an inventory, put a mask on, cause some mayhem, then once you get out of the line of sight of the cops you could remove the mask and lose your wanted level. 

The only way to equip and remove your mask is by going in your home. So is there really even a point to having a mask in the game?
 




 What movies do you think have the best sound design and sound effects? 









 I love movies like Starship Troopers and Jarhead. War movies that focus more on bootcamp, living with a troop and the life of a soldier. War movies that don't really focus on the war and action pert but more on the training and life of a soldier. Not like Saving Private or Black Hawk Down where the focus is on the battle. Any movies or TV shows like this? 














 Purpose: It's mostly going to  be something to carry on a daily basis. Used for things like opening stuff, basic uses, and even, god forbid, self defense if the situation calls for it.(I live in a very rough neighborhood)

Size: I'm looking for something not too big, but still a good size. Something that fits comfortably in a pants pocket.

Knife type: Folding knife is best

Price Range: I'd like to not spend more than $100 if possible.

Type/Style: I don't go camping too often, but I'd love to have something pretty rugged that could handle the great outdoors.

Blade Type: Plain edge is preferred, but a combo of plain and serrated is okay too! 

Blade Steel: I don't know or understand enough about steel to make a good educated guess on what steel would be best. I'm not picky. I guess something that stays sharp longer, but without being too pricy.

Anything else: Nothing else really. Just need a good, durable everyday knife that will last a long time.

If you need anymore info I'd love to give it. Thanks for any and all help! 




 I have very straight and fine and thin hair so I often run into the problem that every product I've used so far makes my hair look and feel gross. Like really greasy. What are some good styling products that work well with my kind of hair and won't make it look and feel gross? 














 I re-watched The Strangers yesterday and that movie may not be the best (I love it), but there is one scene in that movie that's so great. The woman is just walking around her kitchen then out of nowhere the masked dude just walks up on the back door and watches her. No loud music, no sudden movements, no jump scare, just great subtle horror.

Now I'm looking for other horror movies that have great subtle horror. Any ideas? 




 So I was dropping off Jimmy somewhere after switching to Michael and was wondering what would happen if I ran Jimmy over. Turns out that when I ran him over, Michael yelled, "No! No! No!" I got out and Jimmy didn't move.

A day latter I called Jimmy and it was busy. Did I kill Jimmy for good? 




 I just want to screw around in the world with no consequences. I've heard conflicting info on if this cheat is real or not. Is it just no one ha discovered it yet? 




 And what would it basically be about? Buddy cop, road trip, etc.

This question was inspired by a question /u/ctopherrun asked on here regarding a Michael Clarke Duncan/Terry Crews buddy movie. 

But yeah, who are your picks, alive or dead, to see in a buddy comedy movie? 




 I was wondering if anyone has heard anything about when we might see a trailer. It feels weird that there have already been two trailers shown at comic con yet nothing for the public and it's released in May next year.

Godzilla is one of my most anticipated movies and I just want to see something. Does anyone know when they plan on showing a teaser or something? 




 I'm looking for a subreddit like battlestations where people post pics of their setup, but for more home entertainment like stuff. Like console gamers or pictures of entertainment set ups. I don't game on a pc. Mostly xbox. I'm about to redesign my living room and I'm just looking for inspiration, but all I can find really on battlestations are pics of desktops.

Is there a subreddit like battlestations geared more towards console gamers or home entertainment setups?

 I don't ever play strategy games but kind of want to. What are some good strategy games for the 360 for beginners that aren't too complicated? Something to ease me in? 




 Like real adventure movies were someone goes on an adventure or journey or something. Like Up or something. I just can't think of many good adventure movies besides the obvious ones.

So what are your favorite adventure movies? 




 So in the mission where you rescue Asha, the one where you fight your evil twin, I noticed something great. 

When you sneak up on the dude talking to his wife/girlfriend, I just sat there for like more than five minutes just listening to him going, "Mmmmmhmmmmm." crying from all the laughter.

Did anyone else notice this or get as much joy from it as I did? 














 College professor of film or Forensics? There really aren't any specifics. I guess just assume anything and everything. I want help thinking of all the pros and cons of these two career options. I'm at a crossroads in my life and need help understanding the pros and cons so I can better figure out which is best for me. Forget about which one I prefer. All I care about is which is better in terms of the pros and cons.

 I wanted to use the slowmo cheat because it sounds cool, but it doesn't work. It's listed as a cheat on multiple sites. There is also a fast forward cheat, but it does work. I found out that the slowmo cheat is "Silverlink"? What does that mean? Someone said it was unlocked when you finish the game. It didn't unlock for me and I can't find any videos of the slowmo cheat. So is it real?  




 So yesterday I asked what your favorite mission was, but I figured that there are some missions that weren't my favorite, but had some of my favorite moments. So I'm asking a slightly different question that should allow more of a variety of answers and discussion. 




 Pretty simple question. What was your favorite mission? 









 For some reason I love watching love story dramas, where the relationship is tragic. Something like Blue Valentine or A Moment to Remember. What are some films with heart-wrenchingly tragic love stories?  









 I watched Pain and Gain the other night and I was thinking the entire time, "Man, this is some super dark humor." But I kind of liked it. I enjoy dark humor, so I was wondering what movies you guys have seen that has had some really dark humor. What movie has had some of the darkest humor you've seen? 














 I have the link to the video. It's been cut down to the right length, I just need it in gif format with text matching the words, but no text with the "Haha", just the part where he says words. 

[Video](http://www.tubechop.com/watch/1403787)

Thank you! 




 I saw this short film purely because it was suggested in the "Related" section. It was about an artist whose wife dies. Then he builds a sculpture to remember her. As the short progresses, he slowly becomes a statue while his statue of his wife slowly becomes human. Really weird, but beautiful short film. Anyways, can't remember the name and want to show it to someone. Can anyone help? 









 I watched Spy Kids 2 the other day. I loved it when I was a kid, but as a teen I just thought it was terrible. However, as an adult I loved it! I thought it was kind of genius and couldn't help but to love it. I think it's because as an adult, I realized it wasn't really meant to be taken seriously, but instead is suppose to be cheesy. I haven't had that much fun watching a movie in a long time. 

So I got to thinking, what kids movies do you enjoy or understand or appreciate more now that you're an adult? 









 When I heard there were going to be voice sliders I got super excited. But when I fired up the Inauguration Station, created a character, and went to choose his voice, I was sad to see that the voice slider, while it does adjust the pitch, unfortunately gives your character a robotic sound whenever the slider is on anything other than normal. Maybe it's not that big of a deal, but I was just kind of disappointed. 




 Also, what areas should I stay away from when looking for a place to live? Also, would it be cheaper to rent an apartment or buy/rent a house? And what neighborhoods are not only good, but have a reasonable cost of living? If you need any more info, please let me know. I've only been to LA once when I was little and don't know what to look for or where to look. I'm extremely grateful for any and all help/advice! Also, do you know of any great online resources I can find with info on real estate as well as other housing. I live across the country and cannot afford to visit LA frequently. 









 My birthday is coming up this week and me and a few friends are just going to hang out and eat pizza. My question is, what place in Memphis or surrounding areas has the best pizza? Doesn't matter if they do delivery or not. Just looking for the best pizza in the city and neighboring towns. 




 Like the blood effects when someone is shot. I'm interested in which movies you think have the best blood hits. It doesn't have to be an action movie. Even if only one person in the movie is shot, if it's good, I want to know about it. Doesn't matter how realistic or over the top it is, practical effects or CGI, doesn't matter. However, I prefer something visually appealing, but I'm open to any and all suggestions. I'm just interested in the different styles and looks of blood hits there are and want to know which ones you think are the best. 




 I heard a song recently, maybe a pop song, but it's recent. It features what sounds like either a marimba or steel drums. It's not fast paced though, but not too slow. That's really all I know about it. I don't even know the lyrics other than part of the chorus that goes something like, "She something something something." Obviously they don't say "something". The somethings represent how many words there are in the chorus. So he says, "She" then says like three more words. I know it's not much info, but I appreciate any help. 




 I heard a song at work today and loved the beat and rhythm of it, but don't know what it is. I know it's fairly recent because we only pay recent music, but not top forty stuff. I've never heard this song anywhere else before. I know one lyric, "I'll love you until the end of time." Or something like that. It's a pop song with a sort of middle eastern beat/rhythm to it however the singer sounds American. I know that at the end of the song he says, "Until theee eeeeennnndddd ooooof tiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiime."

The song has a pretty chill sound to it. It's not a slow love song. Definitely more of a pop song.

I know this isn't a lot to go on, but it's all I got. 

Edit: New details: Most likely male singer. Also I should clarify what I mean by recent. What I mean by recent is like this year.  




 So I watched Samsara recently and two shots struck me with how powerful and how much they said without saying anything. [This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage v=PAeIDRzGZ1A t=3660) one of a geisha shedding a tear, showing how hard her life must be. And [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage v=PAeIDRzGZ1A t=4602) one of a disfigured war veteran at a memorial cemetery, showing the price for peace and the cost of war.

Are there any other great shots like these? Ones that say so much without saying hardly any dialogue? You know what I mean? Sort of like how a picture is worth a thousand words kind of thing? What are some great examples of this in film? Shots that are so powerful and say so much with so little. I hope I explained myself well. I'm not really looking for scenes per se, more so just single shots. 









 What scenes are your favorite uses of the quiet scream? Where a character screams but the sound of his scream is cut out. Think Dark Knight when Harvey is in the hospital bed and he screams but it's muted out. Or more recently The Artist where the main character has his hallucination and he drops to his knees and screams but is not heard.  




 I'm trying to find movies where the opening scene is basically a quiet, typical opener, then BAM! Something in the vein of the opening scene of [Children of Men](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCTgUq6hzUk). Clive Owen just gets some coffee walks out of the shop, then BOOM! a bomb goes off then title card.

Or Reservoir Dogs. Starts with them having a comical, friendly conversation, then all of the sudden it goes to Orange in the back seat bleeding to death and screaming.

Or think Dark Knight when SPOILER!!!!!!!!! Rachel dies. Shes talking to Harvey, everything's fine, then BOOM, out of nowhere the building explodes.

Another great example isn't a movie, but rather a video posted a few days ago. Where a woman is driving for like 20 seconds then out of nowhere without warning, a car comes flying at her. 

I'm really looking for that contrast of when a scene goes from quaint and quiet to fucked in less than a second. 

I guess it doesn't have to be an opening scene, but it's preferred. The only real stipulation is that it has to be a pretty normal non action scene at first then out of nowhere something happens.  









 So me and my mom watched this Korean movie on Netflix called [A Moment to Remember](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0428870/?ref_=sr_1). I have to say it is one of the best movies I've seen as well as one of the saddest, most heart breaking, yet beautiful. We bawled our eyes out. If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and see this film. 









 I work at American Eagle and supposedly all American Eagles play the same music, so that might help. I only know brief parts of the choruses of the two songs.

The first is a punk rock sounding song with a female vocalist (or at least they sound female). The chorus goes something like: "She said don't forget your friends, I know; Don't forget your friends, I won't; don't forget your friends." Or at least it sounds a lot like that.

The second song I have even less info on. It's a pop song sung by an extremely British guy. So much so that when he says "No" it sounds like, "Now". The chorus goes a little like: "Never gonna get, never gonna gt it, no." I know that's super vague, but at work I can't focus on the lyrics plus it's not ever loud enough.

I only hear these songs at work and I've tried looking up the American Eagle playlist, but still can't find them. I'm grateful for any and all help! Thanks!  




 I was really into this movie I was watching but then when someone died, it was really terrible cgi gore. So I was thinking, what are you're favorite uses of practical gore effects? What scenes really stick out to you when it comes to practical makeup effects? 




 Saw it yesterday and wanted to read some discussions on it, but there are no threads. 

I don't really enjoy horror, but I wanted to see it purely because I heard it was a well made film. I have to say I thought the direction was really great as well as the acting. I thought the first half was fantastic, but I thought the second half, while still good, felt not as great or scary. All in all I thought this was one of the best horrors in years. 

So what did you guys think? Really want to get a discussion started! 




 I moved away recently and don't know anyone where I live now. My birthday is in a few weeks and I got a little depressed because I have no one to spend it with. Then I thought, "Hey, this doesn't have to be a sad thing!" So, now I'm trying to figure out what I can do on my birthday by myself that will be nice, fun, or enjoyable. I don't want to spend my birthday thinking about how alone I am. I want to enjoy it!

So what are some cool/nice/enjoyable things I can do on my birthday without being sad? 
























 Right now Super Hot is getting some buzz. In Super Hot, time moves only when you move. It's pretty interesting. Right now it's only a demo, but still really good and really fun.

Also, there is Receiver. Receiver is an ultra realistic shooter. In the game, you have to operate your gun like you would a real one. Taking it off safety, counting bullets, putting bullets in magazines, cocking it, etc. It makes for some really tense gameplay. Every time you spawn you are given a random gun with a random amount of bullets. 




 It's not my favorite game but one of my favorites.

I always thought Bradley Cooper would be a great Nathan Drake from Uncharted. 




 Boy Meets World.

That or any Disney movie. Especially Disney channel original movies. 




 This is actually the case for most movies! 




 Me. 




 I don't have an under the bed. That's just another place for spiders to go. 




 Fuck.

It doesn't really make sense. In fact, a lot of the time "fuck" and its derivatives are frequently used purely to bridge thoughts and sentences. 

There are plenty of words we could say in it's place, but it *is* useful to express certain emotions. It's the same with any swear word really. They don't make a lot of sense, there are plenty of words that could be said in their place, but they do a good job of expressing certain emotions. 




 Saw Nine Inch Nails. Absolutely fantastic concert. It had the best lighting I've ever seen at a concert and amazing stage design. 




 Nine Inch Nail's album The Fragile. Incredible, interesting music.

Also, apparently Rage Against the Machine's self titled album is recorded with highest standards and is used to test audio equipment. 




 In person? I saw a dead cat. But the way I saw it was like something out of a movie.

I was asked to take care of my neighbor's cat while she was gone for Christmas. One day I went over and saw Mulligan, that's the cat's name, sitting in the bedroom with foamy drool hanging from his mouth and he was making weird noises. I took him to the vet and the vet said it's probably just stress and to not worry about it. "It might go away when the owner gets back."

So a few days later I walk over to my neighbors house to feed him and check up on him. I opened the door and the whole house is silent except for the Beethoven-esque music playing on the radio(we turned the radio on to keep Mulligan company). So this beautiful orchestra music is playing and I look down the hall and all I see is his tail sticking out. I called his name and he didn't respond.

I walked down the hall and there was Mulligan, dead. He was laying next to his toy, too. I checked to see if he was breathing and maybe just passed out. He was stiff as a plank of wood. He was gone at least 12 hours.

The whole thing was very eerie and morbid with the quiet calm house and this beautiful orchestra music echoing through the house. Sad day. Apparently he had a stroke.

I also hit a golden retriever once with my car when I was in high school. That was a tough day. 




 Look, I'm not saying that until we have evidence to disprove it, it's true. I'm saying that until we have evidence to disprove it we shouldn't rule it out.

Something may be ridiculous and unlikely, but that's not enough reason to say it's impossible. Not without evidence. Like I said, the lack of evidence that something *does* exist is not the same thing as having evidence that it *doesn't* exist. 

But you're right. It is a two way street. The lack of evidence that something *doesn't* exist is not the same thing as having evidence that it *does* exist. 

*That's* what I'm saying. No matter how ridiculous something is, without evidence to prove or disprove it, we can't rule it out.

I'm about to throw down another bad analogy. How do we know the sky is blue? Well, through science we know, but let's try another way for the sake of this analogy. A way to know would be to survey thousands of people. If you asked 10,000 people what color the sky is, it's safe to say all 10,000 will say "blue". So it's safe to say that the sky is in fact blue. I mean, how can that many people be wrong, right? Again, bad analogy, but it's the best way I can describe it.

It's kinda the same thing with the Bible. It's full of first hand accounts and testimonies of various people who have come in contact with God and/or Jesus and witnessed their, for lack of a better word, "powers". There *are* witnesses who saw Jesus heal the sick and afflicted. Now *how* he did this and the veracity of it is up to interpretation. But there *are* records of not only Jesus healing people, but also being resurrected. Around a hundred people *witnessed* Jesus being crucified and killed. And a few days later they saw him. Alive. Free of any scars except for the nail holes. Now again, *how* he did this and the veracity of it is up to interpretation, but there is a record of it happening. How could all of these people in the Bible be wrong and crazy? I don't know. But for right now, we have to kinda consider that maybe the Bible is accurate. Even if it is crazy.

 




 But like I said, my Bigfoot analogy was really dumb. It wasn't meant to be taken literally, it was meant to just put in perspective the whole thing. 

And also like I said, if you believe the Bible to be true, then there *is* proof. It's all written there. That's why I used Bigfoot as an analogy. Because the only proof we have are first hand accounts people have. Just like the Bible is firsthand accounts of people's interactions with God and Jesus. But again, this all goes back to faith. It's up to you, and only you to decide whether to believe it or not. And if you don't want to believe, fine, that's okay. That's your choice. 

But you should never rule anything out. We as a human race don't know everything. We are incredibly smart and have made massive advancements, but we still have so much to learn. 

I've said this in another thread but I'll say it here. The lack of evidence that something *does* exist is not the same thing as having evidence that it *doesn't* exist. Until we have evidence to disprove something, we should never rule it out. *That's* science.  




 I can't answer that because I just simply don't know. It's not about anyone being more special than others. It just happened that way. 

However people still had to have faith. There were numerous people who didn't believe. Jesus was crucified because they didn't believe he was the son of God.  




 Do you watch any of your own shows? Like do watch every new episode of Archer or Bob's Burgers when they first air? Like as a fan? Or do you not because hearing your own voice creates some sort of weird disconnect? 




 Then like I also said, if you're the kind of person who needs proof of everything, then there's really nothing anyone can do to convince you. 

No one has any physical evidence of God. Yet you ask for it knowing no one has it. Which leads me to believe that you simply don't want to believe.

So let me ask you: Do you want to believe? Because if the answer is "no" then there is no point in you asking people for evidence. Because there is nothing anyone can say or do to convince you. And maybe you simply don't want to be convinced, and that's okay, because that's what you want. 




 That's what I'm saying, the only evidence we have of God and Jesus doing those things is written in the Bible. It's up to you to have faith that the things written in the Bible are true. Even the crazy things like the burning bush, Moses splitting the sea, Jesus raising the dead and healing the sick and afflicted. 




 Experiences make people smart. You can study about things all you want, but until you experience something or try it out, you can never really fully understand it. I can read about how to cook a certain dish, but it's not until I actually try to cook it and tweak it that I actually *know* how to make it.

Now I'm not sure how much this applies to everything, but so far I've found it to ring true.  




 I don't know if this sheds any light on anything or helps at all, but that is kind of what religion is about. Religion is all about faith. If God came down in the flesh right now in front of everyone and showed us some Godlike powers and we all believed that this was the actual God, then it would eliminate the need for faith. We'd have proof that he exists. Full, undeniable proof.

Depending on what faith you choose to believe, if any, the reason we are here is to receive a body. A physical body. We wanted a body to be more like God and Jesus because they have physical bodies. Before the Earth was created, we were all in heaven. We were presented with two plans. One was by Satan in which we would be forced to do things on Earth against our will. The other plan, presented by Jesus, was we had free agency on Earth. There was a war in Heaven and those who sided with Satan were cast out of Heaven with him. But those who did side with Satan have a chance at redemption, which is a different discussion.

Anyway, those who sided with God and Jesus came to Earth. Here on Earth we not only received a physical body, but free will as well. This brings in the other reason why we are here: To be tested. To have our love for God tested. To have our faith tested. Now that we have free will, do we choose the way of God or Satan? Do we even believe in a God? This is basically our love and faith being tested.

If we have undeniable proof of God, then we don't have faith, we have science. And if we have science, proof of something, then there is no reason to have faith in it because we know beyond a reasonable doubt that it's true. This is a really dumb example, but God and heaven and all that stuff is sort of like Bigfoot. We don't have undeniable proof of his existence, but we have first hand accounts and testimonies of those who claim to have interacted with him. Those who choose to believe in Bigfoot are going on faith. The Bible, should you choose to believe it, is kind of like first hand accounts and records of people who have come in contact with religious experiences and Jesus and what not. 

This all goes back to the core component of religion. Faith. It sounds unreliable, and if you're the kind of person who needs proof of everything then there's really nothing anyone can do to convince you. You just have to have faith.

I hope I helped, even if it is just a little bit.  




 Wait I don't remember that, when did this happen? 




 Yes this is it! Thanks! 




 In this horror movie, which takes place in a jungle type location(maybe Australia?), a group of friends go camping I guess? They swim in a lake and I think one of them gets leeches. The leeches make her sick and turn her into like a homicidal maniac? One scene that sticks out is when the friends attempt to trap their turned friend by dropping a net on her. 

I don't remember thinking it was a great movie but I enjoyed it and would like to watch it again, but I have no idea what it was called. Help? 




 Someone asked what the creepiest Wikipedia article they knew was. I saved the post, but it doesn't show up in my saved section. Also, when I search for it, I can't find it. Did it get deleted? Or does someone have a link to it? 




 I'm curious about what event in your life led you to have such a vendetta against Mormonism. Why can't Mormons believe what they want? Why does what they do bother you so much? 

I just fail to understand why you feel the need to ridicule an entire religion. It shouldn't matter whether you believe what they do or not, or if you think they are ignorant. You don't go around saying people's religions are based off of lies. Religion is supposed to revolve around faith, not facts. Religion is all about worshiping Gods we can't prove exist. So even if you don't believe what Mormons believe is real or true, it doesn't matter. It's real to them. 

Also, why do you care so much? Do you believe you will be the great hero to all ignorant Mormons? The one who will wake them all up and make them see the error of their ways? 




 That's, like, not even the same thing.  




 You just said "probably" wrong. Because you *think* something *might* be wrong doesn't automatically make it wrong. Not unless you have proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The lack of proof that something *does* exist is not the same thing as having proof that it *doesn't* exist.  









 ITT: Mormon Bashing 




 You're allowed to believe whatever you want to believe and whatever, but how could you possibly know that the Book of Mormon is fiction? I mean, it's kind of dickish of you to basically say that everything a religion believes is false. You may *think* that, but you can't *know* that.   




 Poor Marv. 




 Anxiety 




 I don't mind comic book movies. I'm just tired of the idea that instead of Hollywood sitting down and coming up with original films, they look for what ever comic book hasn't been made into a movie, whether it should or not. 

Like I said, I don't mind comic book movies. In fact I quite enjoy them, but it seems like lately instead of being made along side other original films, comic book movies are taking the place of original films. I know Hollywood is a business, but it sucks that Hollywood will almost always choose a super hero or comic book movie instead of taking a risk and making original movies. 




 What nights are the board game nights 














 So my friends are super busy with college and work so we rarely get to hang out, but I love going out. I hate sitting at home by myself. 

What are some places or activities where I could go by myself and still have fun and get enjoyment and not feel weird being alone? 




 They don't have to be night clubs with loud music either. They can be jazz clubs, dance clubs or whatever. I'm just looking for some great clubs or bars with great atmosphere. I don't really venture into the club scene so I have no idea what the club scene in Memphis is like. 




 How do I learn what shows are where and when? Is there like a website or something? 




 I'm new, just starting out. I honestly don't have the slightest idea how to create a podcast. How to record one, and how/where to post it. What are some good resources for someone to learn all of this? Any help is incredibly appreciated! 









 Recently our neighbor went out of town for a few weeks and asked us to watch her cat. Long story short we went to her house to check on him the other day and discovered him lying on the floor dead.

After talking to our neighbor on the phone, she asked us to bury him in her backyard. So we got a box to put him in and when we picked him up he was stiff. Like a plank of wood. His joints wouldn't even move hardly.

What causes this? I know it's suppose to happen, but what happens in the body that causes it to become stiff and hard?

 The Proposition. Really good movie. 




 Also, report back! Would love to see an after shot 




 I know David Fincher comes from a background of directing music videos but who are some other directors who have directed music videos? Either before they were famous or after they became famous, I'm just looking for music videos by film directors.  









 So lately when I'm not home and out in public away from wifi, my phone will not connect to 4g. Like there isn't even an icon at the top. It didn't use to do this. It started about a week ago. It's a pain because it keeps me from doing ANYTHING that requires internet. What is causing this and how can I fix this? Any help?

Here's a screenshot http://imgur.com/390q1uY

You see in the top left corner? No wifi signal, no 4G, 3G or anything. 




 Why do you say that? If I said something wrong can you please correct me? 




 Yes this exactly. I haven't done anything different. Just one day there was nothing. 




 You're not getting too old. Rockstar tried to make a game with rules that contradict the kind of game it is. Open world sandbox games are not supposed to be restrictive. 




 I always thought it was more about the leather and less about cats. Like, he seems like a kind of latex/leather sort of guy.

 Charlie's Angels. I love that movie so much.  




 I dunno, I'd show a 13-14 year old The Matrix but probably not Wolf of Wall Street.  




 "How much you wanna make a bet I could throw a football over them mountains?" - Napoleon Dynamite 

I love it because it's so dumb and he's completely serious when he says it. 




 And don't be broad by saying Italian or Asian. Be specific! If it's pizza, what kind of pizza? What's on it? Describe what is in or on your favorite food! If it's from a restaurant, which one? 




 /r/nocontext 




 I think this is the best answer.  




 I'm super late to the party so this probably won't be seen.

The Tree of Life. I grew up in a very religious family. A family sort of like the one in the movie. I was super close to my mother and my father was a hard worker, so he wasn't around much. He was stern, didn't say much, and had a hard time showing his love for anyone. We all knew he loved us, but had a hard time saying or showing it. I saw the movie with my mother and we both cried. It was a very beautiful film about family, life, death, faith, and what it all means. 




 Even though I'm in my 20s, I felt like I was going to get in trouble by my mom for watching this movie. 




 It's hard to believe this is the same guy. 




 I'm wasn't defending Argo or knocking Lincoln, I was just interested in why you thought that. After your explanation I can see where you're coming from. Lincoln did have pretty great performances.  




 Question, What exactly did you find great about Sam Rockwell's performance in The Way Way back? I saw it and thought, while good, it mostly felt like Sam Rockwell being Sam Rockwell. 




 Really though? I mean I thought he was great but it felt like he was just Sam Rockwell in it. I'm not saying you're wrong for thinking that, I just find it an interesting choice. 




 I'm surprised to see New World mentioned. That movie was fantastic and Hwang Jeong-min was great! 




 You could also argue that Lincoln is a type of movie that has been done a hundred times over.  




 Wow, I never heard this before. It's fantastic! 




 Any song, anywhere, as long as it was a live performance. Links welcomed! 









 All I really listen to are 101.9, 98.1, 99.7 and 107.5. But they all play the same music. What are some other radio stations with different music? 









 Tree of Life. I think it's one of the greats. It's a super mixed movie. People either love it or hate it. Mostly hate. It has a pretty low score on IMDB (or at least to me it's low). And everyone I've talked to about it says its bad.  




 See the saddest thing about Paul Walker is that he was on the cusp of pulling a Matthew McConaughey. He was totally about to become the actor he was suppose to be. Running Scared is one of my all time favorites. 
 









 I'm not trying to discredit animated films or the people who make them. But I think it's more difficult to create beautiful cinematography in a live action film because cinematographers have to work within the realm of reality. They have do deal with real world lighting and what not. Whereas animators can kind of make it up. 

Again, I'm not trying to discredit any animated films or the hard work people put into making them.  




 What scene on top of the train? 




 I think there was something to get. But you didn't get it not because you're not smart, I just think that the movie was super vague on its symbolism and metaphors. I think even the smartest people will scratch heir heads at it.  




 I still want to see him do a super hero movie. 




 I just can't find it for the life of me. Anyone else go here that knows how? 




 xXx (Triple X)? 




 I don't know how plausible this is, but it could be he simply didn't know he was plagiarizing. 

What I mean is, have you ever thought of something or tried to remember something and then you think, "I can't remember if this was from a movie or book or dream."

There's a word for it. When you think of something and you think you're creating it from scratch but subconsciously you're pulling it from you memories of, in this case, a book. 

Now I'm not saying this is what happened or even that it's likely, but it is possible.  









 For example, Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit is one of my favorites.

Also, it can be a prequel, sequel, threequel or whatever. 









 Man I would have loved to see Inception as a horror movie. I really want to see what Nolan can do with horror. And I would love to see what kind of creepy, horrific, twisted things would've happen since anything can happen in dreams. Would be very interesting. 




 I think it all depends on personal taste. I prefer TRL because it focuses on the emotional and psychological toll of war. I love SPR, and I appreciate what it was trying to say but its message was drowned out by all the action and violence surrounding it.

Edit: Wow downvoted because my opinion is different than yours. Thanks for encouraging opinions and discussion, reddit.  




 Also, the Elton John biopic coming up. 




 Yeah that was probably the biggest shocker of the award season last year. Everyone thought Lincoln would win everything.  




 Hugo was pretty and well shot. But Tree of Life was incredibly gorgeous. Easily one of the most beautiful films ever shot.  




 I would give The Tree of Life best cinematography. One of the most beautiful movies. 

Also I don't know if it got a nomination or not but Samsara should have gotten best documentary. 

And I still think its a crime Christopher Nolan didn't get a best director nomination for Inception. 

Also I'd give Into the Wild a nomination for best score, original song, cinematography, picture, and leading actor. Don't know which it would've won but it definitely deserved more nominations.  




 You say that but if I remember correctly (which I'm probably wrong) didn't Lincoln only walk away with just a few awards? 




 I *hope* it's Lupita. I love Jennifer Lawrence and think she's a great actress and I haven't seen American Hustle, but Lupita's performance was incredible.  




 Frances Ha is one of my favorites of the year. Gerwig was great in it.  




 I definitely consider it emotional. It's a song where you can feel his pain. 




 Ouch :( 




 Exactly. 




 Lately I've been trying to find music where the singer is singing with so much emotional power, it's like you can feel their pain. Their suffering. Their sadness. Almost to where it might even sound like they're crying or holding back tears.

What are some songs like this? 









 I watched [The New Guy](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0241760/?ref_=nv_sr_3) the other day for the first time in years and I thought it was pretty great. I wanted to know what those of you who have seen it thought about it.

I thought it had some really great physical comedy and had some great cameos by celebrities. Definitely one of my favorite high school movies. It even has a decent message about being yourself and not forgetting who you really are.

Any one here seen it? And if so what are your thoughts on it? It's not a movie that gets mentioned hardly ever. 




 It's not that. This article is basically saying, "Despite your opinion, these are the worst movies of the year and if you like them and think they are not that bad then you are wrong." At no point do they say, "Hey, this is just our opinion." They're treating their opinion like it's the correct one. 




 I like to believe everyone is going by the saying, "Out of sight, out of mind." I think everyone wants to just forget that movie happened. And the best way to forget it is to never mention it. 




 I really liked Wrong and thought it was good. 




 It's not the same song, but it definitely sounds like the same guy. His name is Johann Johannsson. 




 This looks so sick! I really really hope this doesn't turn in to another case of Man of Steel where the trailer turns out better than the movie. I'm optimistic though.  




 I'm late but I wanted to give my personal thoughts on it. There have been some great advice on here already as well as not so great. But here are my thoughts. 

I feel like if two people love each other, and I mean really love each other, they will understand if one of them wants to wait. I feel like they wouldn't throw away their relationship with you if you don't do it. 

Also I feel there are more important things I want in a relationship than sex. Now is sex important? Yes I feel it is. But I don't think you can base your decision of whether you love someone or not on sex. I want a girl that I can have deep intense conversations with and I can feel comfortable being vulnerable around them. If I find a girl like that and we love each other, and she tells me she wants to wait, I'm not going to throw it all away.  It doesn't mean she loves me less. 

But this is all just my feelings on this.  




 I love them. They bring me back to a time when I was that age. I know most people would like to forget that time but it was the best time of my life. I love being reminded of it.  




 It makes it feel like I'm looking into the human body. Cells, nerves, all that stuff. 

I know this has been theorized before, but it's so cool to think about. What if our universe *is* someones body. And what if all of our bodies are different universes for other life forms. And their bodies and so on and so forth. Infinite universes.  




  two many ears

FTFY 














 But why do you think that though? 




 You're right. I was super surprised to hear the many bad reviews of The Counselor. I mean, when you look at all the people involved in it; Ridley Scott, Cormac McCarthy, Brad Pitt, Michael Fassbender, and Javier Bardem, it's easy to assume it won't be anything other than great. 




 But based on the director and his previous works, didn't you know what you were getting yourself in to? I mean Nicolas Refn isn't exactly known for having fast paced non stop action movies. What exactly *were* you expecting when before you saw it?

 




 Doesn't that kind of make it partly your fault? When you allow yourself to have high hopes for something, you automatically take the risk of it not meeting those expectations. Am I saying you're wrong for not liking it? No, not at all. It's perfectly okay to not like it. 

I am curious though to know your thoughts on it. 




 I agree. I think people are over exaggerating how terrible these movies are. I mean, they're pretty well made movies. Are they great? Not really, but I've seen WAY worse movies. In fact, I actually kind of dug the super dark comedy/crime tone of Hangover 3.  




 I was the same way. OGF is one of my favorites of the year. While I realize it's not perfect, I didn't think it was terrible. People tend to think that "slow" and "violent" and "little dialogue" automatically means bad. I understand that many people may not be into that, but that doesn't make something terrible. 




 I don't think this is the kind of movie you see based off of what people say. It's a very subjective kind of movie. You should see it on your own merits. If it is something you might be interested in then give it a watch. 




 You need to get your expectations straight before you see OGF. It's not Drive. Visually it's similar, but Drive is a lot more straight forward and easier to watch. If you go into OGF with the expectations that it's like Drive you won't enjoy it as much. It is incredibly slow. It takes its time. More so than Drive. It is more like Refn's Valhalla Rising. I'd say that if you like Drive than there is a good chance you'll like OGF, just don't expect it to be another Drive. If you don't mind movies that take their time and are really slow, then give it a watch. 




 Exactly. I feel like any movie can be terrible if you had the wrong expectations for it.  




 I know she doesn't resemble the physique of Wonder Woman, but I would've loved to have seen Olga Kurylenko as Wonder Woman. 









 "How much you wanna bet I could throw a football over them mountains?" 




 Of course it's private. 









 This is very helpful! Thank you! 




 I was watching Jumper, and it reminded me of the sweet marketing it had before its release. Before there was even a trailer, Jumper had this really cryptic website that, if I remember correctly, was set up like a conspiracy bulletin board with weird photos and notes on it. Finding out what the movie was, was sort of like solving a mystery. The same with Cloverfield. Strange teaser. Cryptic website.

What movies do you think have had great, clever, or interesting marketing? Billboards, websites, teasers, promotions, or anything else that falls under marketing. 









 MLA format.

I'm wondering about how to do a citation for a movie? I've never cited a movie before. I'm wondering if I need to cite a specific quote from a movie, or just reference the movie then cite it. Can I just reference a film and that count as a proper citation? Or if it's a quote from a person do i have to cite the person who said it in the movie as well as the movie itself? 









 Specifically citations? I posted in /r/HomeworkHelp, but that community isn't super active with there hardly ever being more than a dozen people there at a time. HomeworkHelp is great, but I need to find somewhere to ask a citation question where I can get some feedback quickly. Any subreddits like this? I have to finish this paper and all I need to do is work in this one source I'm having trouble with. Help? 




 My essay is basically done. All I need to do is work in a citation somewhere.

My question is about how to use a citation. Can I just reference something and that be considered a citation? Or does it have to be a direct quote? 

For example, my teacher is telling us that one of our citations has to be from this documentary we watched about The Black Power sign showcased at the 1968 Olympics. So I didn't really know how to use a movie as a source.

How exactly do I use a movie as a source? Can I put in a quote from someone that they said within the film and consider that a proper citation of the movie? Like for instance if someone said, "The stunt they pulled at the Olympics in 1968 is what propelled the Black Power Movement forward." If I put that quote in my essay, is that a proper way to use a movie as a source?

I really need help figuring out how to use this movie as a source. It's literally all I have left to do in my essay, and I cannot figure how how to do it properly. I've never used a movie as a source. Help? 




 Dat drum intro/outro 




 It doesn't have to be something exactly $50,000, but just think of it as that's how much you have at your disposal to spend on someone. 

Edit: Screw it! I can't change the title so I'll put in this edit. I'm raising the limit to $500,000. I want to see what you guys come up with. I want o see how much good you can do. And so you don't have to rack your brain trying to figure out how to spend every penny of it, let's say you can do whatever you want with whatever is left over. Blow it, put it in the bank or whatever. But I don't want to hear what you'll do with what's left, I want to hear how you'll use that money for good. 









 The Matrix. Saw it for the first time when I was a kid. It blew my mind. It was the movie that made me realize that movies can be more than just entertainment. I realized they could be art. If it wasn't for the Matrix, I wouldn't have seen all the movies I have seen now. The Matrix is also what got me into film making. Film is my passion. I love watching them and making them, and I owe it all to The Matrix. 




 You look like a tv star! 




 Don't know if you have one, but I'd love to see a current pic? If that's okay 




 I think there's more than that involved when it comes to Oscar bait. When I think of Oscar bait I think: period piece, usually biopic, has an ensemble cast, they alter their appearance somehow, and is usually directed by an Oscar nominated director. 

Things like The Kings Speech, The Artist, Lincoln, and even though it isn't out yet, American Hustle is looking that way. Now does Oscar bait mean "bad"? I don't think so. All those movies I listed are great. And even American Hustle looks good.  




 I'm the same way. I find myself playing devil's advocate a lot when talking about people with a group of friends. I don't like talking about someone behind their back. It feels...weird. It feels like I'm betraying them. I just can't do that. And if I do start to talk about someone, I feel bad midway through my sentence and back out before any damage is done. I guess it's because my parents always told me to "treat everyone like they are having a harder time than you." I don't know what kind of life this person has when I'm not around. I don't know what problems this person might be dealing with. And insulting them, whether it be to their face or behind their back, doesn't solve anything. 




 I don't know, man. They were either Oscar bait or had heavy handed messages about the environment, racism, or religion. 




 If that's the criteria we're going with for what makes something terrible, then I guess there are a lot of highly praised Oscar movies that are terrible. Wall-e's terrible, Americn History X is terrible. As well as American Beauty, Django Unchained, Gravity, 12 Years a Slave, The King's Speech, The Artist. I mean really, with the criteria you set up for what makes a movie terrible, this list can get pretty long. 




 But why though? I'm genuinely curious, not trying to start something. 




 Whenever 2004s Crash is brought up, almost everyone says it was terrible and "utter shit". I mean, it's not the best movie, and it shouldn't have won Best Picture that year, but I feel like I'm one of the few that not only like Crash, but think it's pretty good. Yeah it seems heavy handed with its message and it might have been Oscar-baity, but the acting seemed really solid. And the cinematography was pretty good as well as the directing. I mean all in all I think it's a decent movie at worst.

I just fail to understand why most people will say it's absolutely terrible and again, "utter shit". Could someone civilly explain to me why people think this, or if you think it then why?  I'm genuinely curious.  




 Yeah I love Saving Private Ryan, but I think The Thin Red Line is the better WWII movie. 




 Dude, was it oscar baity? Yes. Was it the best movie of that year? Not at all. But Crash is in no way a bad movie. 




 Everyone has their own opinion and to each his own, but I think "terrible" is a little strong. This was not a bad movie. It may have not even been good, but I thought it was decent and solid. What makes you say it's terrible? 




 Me? I mean when you look at who's involved it seems reasonable to assume it would be great.  




 I loved the original, but maybe I'm not as much as a hardcore fan because all in all I thought it was a solid remake. And I use "solid" loosely. It wasn't bad. In fact, it's pretty decent. I think as a movie it's pretty good, but as a remake it could have used some work. Maybe this will be a Daredevil scenario where the directors cut will greatly improve it. 




 When I said it felt rushed, I didn't mean just the ending felt rushed, I meant the whole movie felt rushed. 




 Eh, I don't know. I guess I could buy that considering it's a different country with a different character. And without spoiling anything, they do kind of hint at something that could definitely make that a possibility. 




 I watched Frances Ha and I really loved how it captured the mood, tone, vibe, and what life living in New York City is like. What are some other movies that really capture what life in a big city is like? Where it's almost like the city itself is a character? Whether it be NYC, Detroit, LA, Hong Kong, Tokyo, or whatever. 




 As someone who has seen the original I thought it was actually pretty good. It's not bad at all. Josh Brolin is great in it. It's shot well. It's definitely a good remake, but like I said, it did feel rushed. But all in all it was pretty good. However, I think if you have the opportunity to see the original, you have to watch it. Spike Lee's is good, but Chan Wook Park's is a masterpiece. But if you can't watch the original, then Spike Lee's is a good option. It stays pretty close to the original. 




 That's funny cause I just saw it and I thought it felt rushed. 





























 In all honesty I'd love to see Zac Efron in a really different role. Like something other than a comedy or romance movie. I think he is a talented actor, but he keeps choosing roles that are pretty boy roles. He wants to break from High School musical. He came close with the Paperboy, but he keeps playing the pretty boy. He needs to pick a role that will change his image or force him to play more than a pretty boy. Something like Christian Bales American Psycho.

Another talented actor is Robert Pattinson. Twilight may be terrible, but he was not the problem with them. He's good in what ever he does, but he keeps getting bad roles. Luckily The Rover looks really promising. 









 [Here!](http://vimeo.com/43883589) 




 Yeah, sort of. Like no one well known. Find fantastic actors who don't mind having sex, or good porno actors, and not make it sex with a story, but a story with sex. So I guess more like erotica. But have legitimately good writing, story, acting, a score, and cinematography. 

I always picture it like, "What if Terrence Malick made porn?" 




 It was just a short skateboard doc. More about the philosophical side of skateboarding. 




 I take the interstate *to* because it's quicker. I take the backroads *from* because it's beautiful. 




 The girls from The Crucible. 




 Nope. But I did work on a movie that was released in a few theaters and a documentary that won best cinematography and best short documentary. I've made a few short stuff, but nothing major. Although, I have thought about making a "good" porno before. 




 What about zombies you see in newer fiction? Zombies who are living, breathing humans infected with a virus instead of the undead. 




 I guess it depends on what you mean by movies.  




 Cold. 




 Try turning all things off that produce light (tv, night light, etc.). Make your room as dark as possible. Maybe get some white noise like a floor fan or ambient natural sounds like rain or waves. Also keep your room at a comfortable temperature (not too hot, not too cold).  




 Got me through high school 




 Learn the notes and practice. 

[UltimateGuitar](http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/) has tabs for just about every song. 




 Watch a movie. Nothing like losing yourself for two hours in another world. There are movies for all kinds of moods, all kinds of tastes. There's something for everyone. 




 Love :( 




 Dream job no doubt. I would fund my first feature length film and hope for the best. 




 Same it is every year: Be a better me than I was last year. 




 Made a post that was an album of screenshots of Mulan. 




 Mostly because of my religion. But even if it wasn't for my religion, I don't like needles.

Also the thought of a tattoo gives me anxiety. Having to decide what image/word I want to have on my body for the rest of my life is *too* much for me. 




 To move out west. 




 Movies and movie making. I guess it partly has to do with the escapism aspect of watching a movie. For two hours I can disappear into another world.

I love filmmaking because I love making stories and ideas a reality. I love telling stories visually. I'm good at it, and I've never really been good at anything really. When I make a film, I'm *creating art*. Which is so cool to me. I'm making something. I'm making an idea I had a reality. I'm bringing this idea to life and making it a physical thing.  




 My buns and thighs. I'm like the only guy I know who gains weight in his butt and thighs. All the other guys gain in their stomach or waist. I hate having a big booty.

Also, my face. I'm hairy everywhere else: my head, chest, arms, legs, butt, and nether regions. But for some reason I simply *cannot* grow facial hair of any kind. I'm in my twenties and I look like a chubby sixteen year old. 




 A Moment to Remember, a Korean film. I bawl my eyes out every time I watch it. It tells a story of a man and women who fall passionately in love, but their love is put to the greatest test when [Spoiler](/s "his wife develops Alzheimer's, develops dementia, and starts losing her memory. The last thirty minutes of it rips your heart right out.") 

Sounds cheesy, but it's executed perfectly and feels genuine and never comes off as cheesy or hoakey.
 




 There's a lot to pick from, but I really really love The Tree of Life. I think it's an incredible achievement in film. The fact that it can tell this ambitious, yet small story set across a cosmic, "greater power" background is incredible. This movie is very divisive I only know one person personally who liked it while the other people I know who saw it thought it was bad.

I saw it with my mother and we both cried. We could both relate to the story. I had a strict father who I knew loved me, but had a hard time showing it, and as a result I was closer to my mother than my father. The movie really resonated and affected me probably more than any other movie I saw. It's a beautiful film that tells a beautiful story and has gorgeous cinematography, visual effects, and music. With acting that reminds you that great acting doesn't have to be explicit, it can also be subtle.  




 Has to be Star Trek. The thought of just exploring the universe in what is probably one of the coolest space ships ever sounds incredible. 




 In no order

Inherent Vice

Gone Girl

Interstellar

The Raid 2

Knight of Cups (or any of the three Malick films that are supposedly coming out this year) 




 Right now it's Tarantino and Christoph Waltz. Mainly because I think they are a match made in heaven and it clearly comes across on screen. I wish they had gotten together earlier in their careers though. The more films they do together, the better.

Another match made in heaven are Nicolas Winding Refn and Ryan Gossling as well as Winding Refn and Cliff Martinez, his choice composer.   




 1. 12 Years a Slave - I've heard quite a bit of criticism about this film being "pretentious", "self-indulgent", and "over rated". I love Steve McQueen and think he is a fantastic director. 12 Years is almost a perfect movie that I think will be considered a classic. I like how it was unflinching in its portrayal of slavery. We've often seen the hard labor and verbal abuse slaves endured, but never really the physical abuse. It also has some of the best acting I've seen.

2. The Place Beyond the Pines - Another movie that has received quite a bit of criticism, more so than 12 Years. I absolutely loved how this film almost felt like a stage play. How it was clearly broken into three acts. I think the acting, directing, and music are great. Could this movie have been better? I guess, but I still thought it was fantastic. I also really loved the father-son aspect of it. I'm super close to my father and this film really resonated with me and affected me emotionally more than any film this past year.

3. Only God Forgives - Probably the most divisive movie of the year. Heavily criticized for it's lack of story and plot. I think the minimalist thing works for this film though. What it lacks in substance, it more than makes up for in style. I love Nicolas Winding Refn because he's unafraid to make the kind of movies we don't usually see. He doesn't care if you like his movies and that gives him more freedom. Only God Forgives probably has the best cinematography, set design, and score that I saw in a film last year. This movie isn't for everyone though so I understand why it's a divisive film. 




 There is /r/MoviePosterPorn 




 I actually found Looper to be underwhelming.  




 It's funny you say that because 4 isn't *that* bad and an "R" rating doesn't guarantee good. A Good Day to Die Hard returned to "R" and still was hot garbage.  




 There's a movie called This Means War about kids who have a pretend war with sticks and stuff, but you see it from their perspective so the stick guns look real and when they get shot there's blood. Pretty good movie.  




 Too bad they cut it off. 




 This has to be the *longest* Grammys yet. 




 Around $600 




 There was a post on here or r/gaming, but I'm sure it was here. It was an album of pics that turned skyrim into a desert. I can't find it anywhere. Anyone know where the post is or what the mod was called? 




 That sounds fantastic! 




 I've played hundreds of hours of Skyrim on consoles. I've finally decided to build a pc!

My question isn't necessarily "What are the must have mods?" My question is, what mods will freshen up the game and breath new life in it and change it up enough for someone who has spent hundreds of hours in this world? 




 You do know the first rule of being a troll is to not tell people you're a troll, right? Otherwise what's the point? 




 What does it do? 




 I don't want to out myself. 




 I'd change r/funny to r/AmeteurNight 




 Lost a lot of weight and got in shape. I'm now overweight again. Maybe *this* time they'll notice. 




 Movies have been around for a hundred years. Video games have only been around for only like half that at most. And they *were* originally created as a kid's toy sort of. But nowadays games are growing. They *are* a valid and great form of storytelling. I think in maybe thirty years it will get there. Honestly it probably won't be until graphics in games are nearly undistinguished from reality that they will be taken as seriously by *everyone*.  




 Injuries that involve bones breaking.  




 It's not high school. 




 I stayed awake for like 3 days once in Boy Scouts because we were cooking a lot of butts for a fundraiser. 




 I have to poop with my pants and underwear completely off. Like not around my ankles. Like off of me. It feels restrictive, and when I feel restricted I can't poop. 




 1. Graduating high school because I didn't take it seriously and almost didn't graduate.

2. Close second was becoming an Eagle Scout. I wasn't super into Boy Scouts, but I was so close to getting my Eagle and my parents really wanted me to do it, so I did. It made my parents super proud of me which makes me happy. In retrospect, I'm glad I didn't give up entirely.  




 Sausage, beef, steak, six kinds of cheese, extra cheese, and white sauce instead of standard red pizza sauce. 




 Probably still in Memphis. Damn. Hopefully I'll be at least close to getting married to someone. Hopefully have a house. Hopefully I'll be a professor somewhere out west. 




 The toys I had. Kids today, and of the future, all their toys are electronics. Mp3 players, tablets, phones, etc. *My* toys were action figures, board games, stuffed animals, etc. These things still exist, but no child today wants these. When I was a kid all I wanted were G.I. Joes. Last year, my friends kid was asking him for an Xbox One, an ipad, and a moped. 




 Ate a lot. 




 Not really. I had probably close to twenty friends in high school. So far I only keep in touch with like four or five of them and only hang out frequently with like two of them.

With work and college, not only do you find it hard to keep in touch and get together with old friends, but you meet new ones. 




 I was babied pretty hard growing up. My parents never made me get a job and spoiled me and my sister. This led to me not being prepared for being on my own in the real world. Still love my parents to death, though. 




 So I'm 20 and I've only had two jobs. One was for a place I worked at for only a month before leaving for school. I went to school for a year. Then I got another job. I had every intention of keeping this job. However I was laid off after only a month because "they couldn't afford to keep me on."

My question is, when applying for a job, should I leave off the second job? My mother said I should because it makes me look bad because it looks like I quit jobs after only a month. But I said I *should* put my second job because experience is experience, even if it is just an extra month.

Is putting on the second job on applications hurting my chances of getting a job? 




 Fags are going to hell and shouldn't be given any rights, we already made this mistake once with black people, don't let it happen again. 




 Clothes, movies, definitely junk food. 




 I guess pretty far. Mine would suggest it was long. 




 Today I learned 




 I thought it had a fantastic first three quarters that were filled with suspense and great directing, but that last quarter turned into a generic possession/exorcism scene. 




 A 2001: A Space Odyssey remake directed by J.J. Abrams starring Brad Pitt and featuring Matthew McConaughey as HAL. 




 Blue Valentine. Very sad, tragic and beautiful movie. 




 Man the last thirty minutes of this movie are absolutely fantastic!  




 It's a shame we likely won't see this movie anytime soon, if at all. 




 Charlie's Angels. Yeah the movie is dumb, but I think Rockwell kills it. 




 Bad posture.  




 She knows 




 Can they be purchased? Would love to have one in the dining room or hearth room.  














 I love movies that have spy stuff, secret agent stuff, undercover stuff, and surveillance stuff. But not James Bond movies, movies like Zero Dark Thirty and Body of Lies. Like the more realistic and maybe even more politically charged ones. The Bourne movies are another example. What are some similar movies?  




 Don't forget glamorous! 




 Any lyric that rhymes a word with the same exact word. 

Also, "Baby can you breathe?/ I got this from Jamaica/ It always works for me-heeeee"

In that weird whisper voice of his.  




 I don't know, if my phone rings or I get a text, I'll see who it is. If it's my sister it's usually an emergency because she never calls me unless it's important. It's always usually a text. My phone shows me a preview of a text and if it appears to be an emergency, I'll look at it, but if it's just a mundane message it can wait.  




 I chew with my mouth closed in public but when I'm around my immediate family, I don't monitor how I chew. Is this still rude? 









 They can be comic strips, graphic novels, or anything. Just not a super hero themed one. 




 Really beautiful! Can someone with more knowledge than me explain what RAW is and what shooting in it does? 




 That's what I'm wondering. Why post this when the casting appears to already be over? 




 I'm shooting a documentary and I'm looking to get some nice skyline and rooftop shots of Memphis. What are some places where I can do this? 




 I'm not saying critics are always right. I love plenty of movies critics call "terrible." But ratings act as a guideline for people. Most people don't have the time to pick just any movie and hope its good. They want it to be worth their time. They want to know it will be good. The unfortunate truth is that a lot of horror movies are poorly rated, which hurts the genre. Now smaller, creative, and good horror movies don't get seen. Critics are most definitely not always right, but they do have a HUGE influence on what people watch.  




 Yeah I thought the zombie pov was super creative, but I guess I'm just so over zombies. Also, in all honesty, the eyeball one, while kinda cool in concept, was sooo dumb.  




 I agree, but I think the way to do it is to set up jump scares that don't happen. Here's a comment I made earlier. 

"See the thing about jump scares is that they are only suppose to happen twice. Once at the beginning and once at the end. The point of the first one is to put the audience on edge. Showing them that anything can pop out at any minute. What makes this effective is that by not having a jump scare again, you put the audience in suspense of something that won't happen again. That's why the jump scare is genius. You make them think it can happen at anytime but don't. The point of the second and final jump scare is for the payoff. Now that the audience has been waiting the entire time for the next jump scare, they let their guard down because it's been like an hour or so. That's when you let loose the second and final jump scare.

That's how jump scares are suppose to work, but people instead decide to make that the scary part and put them in every 5-10 minutes."

That's how jump scares are suppose to work, but people instead decide to make that the scary part and put them in every 5-10 minutes.  




 That's what I hear. I only saw part of the first season. Is it more supernatural stuff like ghosts or what? 




 I'm not saying horror movies need to be big budget, I'm just curious as to why everyone believes story, writing, and acting have to take a backseat instead of riding shotgun along *with* the horror.  




 I dunno. I always felt comedy is the hardest because it's the most subjective and broadest subject. I feel like it's pretty universal what most consider scary and horrific. Sure, there are specific phobias like heights, spiders, the ocean, etc that some find scary that others don't. But I think everyone can agree that murderers, creatures, and being alone in a dark haunted place is scary. I do think however that it's easier to creep people out than to all out scare them. I personally find subtle stuff like shadows moving in the background or footprints leading under the bed far more scarier than "in your face" stuff.  




 Inside, Martyrs, and The Devil's Backbone are fantastic! But Martyrs felt less like a horror movie and more like a depressing drama with horrific things happening to this person. Which I guess now that I've written that out could be considered a horror movie.  




 True, but I feel like with action and rom-coms, we may rarely see great ones, but we kinda consistently see decent ones. Whereas with horror, it's rare to come across even decent ones. Especially horror movies made by big studios.  




 The entirety of Enter the Void feels like a dream sequence because of how surreal it is. 

The shining also has some creepy dream sequences. 

And the obvious choice would have to be Inception.  




 I actually really want to see we are what we are. I hear it's great 




 It was the cult one with all the kids. Or was that the first VHS?

Edit: Yes it was the second one. The segment was titled "Safe Haven." 




 The problem with VHS 2 is that there is really only one part of it that is good and it's only 20 minutes out of an hour and a half.

As for the indie stuff, I agree that there are quite a few that I hear are good but I just don't know how to watch them without buying them. 




 I started thinking about this while browsing the horror section of Netflix. There tends to be a lot more horror movies that are bad compared to other genres. In fact, it's quite rare we see good horror movies anymore. Horror movies tend to hang around a 6 or below on IMDB or a 50 or below on Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic. The most recent good horror movie I can think of is The Conjuring. Which had a great first 3 quarters, but the last quarter turned into a pretty generic possession scene.

Why is this the case? What's the cause of this? Is it the over saturation of them? Is it because they're generally easier to make on a low budget or what? It seems like the only truly good horror movies, with a few exceptions, are foreign now. Is it because most directors/writers/producers believe that story, acting, writing, and character development aren't as important in the horror genre? 




 Terrence Malick's The Thin Red Line Criterion Collection is considered one of the best Bluray transfers. Also, Samsara is jaw-droppingly gorgeous. 

The Tree of Life is pretty killer as well.

If you want to find out which blurays are worth getting, [blu-ray.com](http://www.blu-ray.com/) has just about every bluray reviewed based on video, audio, and special features. 




 His other brother was also in a movie called Electick Children. A movie about a teen girl who becomes impregnated by rock music. 




 When Ohio is for Lovers came out I thought it was the sickest! 




 I know every lyric to this song. 









 I love Terrence Malick so much! 




 [The Divide](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1535616/?ref_=nv_sr_2)

A movie about a group of people who take shelter in a basement after a nuclear attack. As days go by, their mental, emotional, and physical states start breaking down. It's a great scifi drama that focuses on the conflict between these people. Criminally underrated and filled with fantastic acting, music, and cinematography.

[Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLpieSNIfk). Kind of cheesy trailer that doesn't due justice to the movie. 




 I really liked Martyrs. I can't say I enjoyed it obviously. It's something I don't EVER want to watch again, but it's a unique movie and I'm glad I own it. 




 At a 5.8, the lowest I have is The Divide. Not super low because I actively avoid getting bad movies unless I love them. I love this movie. I wouldn't even call it bad. This is a REALLY good sci fi movie. It's about a group of people who retreat into a small bomb shelter during a nuclear war. The more time they spend in the shelter, the crazier and more unhinged they become.

It's not the best movie, but it has some fantastic acting, music, and cinematography. It all takes place in the shelter. Some want to go out. Others obviously don't. Who will break? Who will survive?

This movie also takes some interesting turns as the peoples mental, emotional, and physical state break down.

I came to own it after watching it online. I was looking for something to watch and it looked good, but I was not expecting what I got. After watching it, I had to take some time to let it sink in. It stuck with me days after I saw it. There is a haircut scene that was one of the best scenes of that year. It's a dark, bleak, and emotionally draining movie.

I would totally recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys sci fi that is more about the human drama and how humans react to disaster and tragedy. It's one of my favorite movies I own and it's so good. 




 1. Memphis, TN

2. August 4

3. I love a good crime movie, also really love surreal and mind bending stuff.

4. Either Spy Kids or Charlie's Angels.

5. Definitely Charlies Angels

6. In The Name of the King

7. I love Terrence Malick, David Fincher, Christopher Nolan, and Coen Brothers. Those are the only directors that I've liked everything they've done.

8. Either Enter the Void, The Thin Red Line, or Tree of Life.

9. As of right now, the bluray of The Chaser. Or a directors collection of any of the directors I listed.

10. Alphabetical of course!

11. Amazon wish list keeps track of the ones I want

[Here's](http://imgur.com/a/h5dec#0) my collection after about a year or so of collecting! Looking forward to adding more!

 




 Enter the Void actually isn't all that disturbing. It's weird, strange, and trippy. It has some uncomfortable scenes, but it's definitely far from being one of the most disturbing films. It's actually a really cool movie from a technical and visual standpoint. 




 His name is Joel David Moore 




 So that's why she was nominated and will probably win. The Oscars just want a story. 




 I kinda agree, but I feel like I don't know enough about cinematography or the production of Gravity to say for sure.  




 Someone in the Golden Globes thread said this about Lawrence, "Her name alone gets her awards." Which I think is totally true.  




 I think while Gravity was remarkable technically, I think it is the weakest contender for best picture. There really isn't a lot of substance there that *I* could see story wise and the writing was okay. But I think the other films are all around great not just technically, but also story wise, acting wise, writing, etc. I just think the other noms are more well rounded. 

That said, Gravity should take all technical awards.  




 I know this movie has gotten a lot of hate, but I thought the cinematography and score in Only God Forgives was fantastic. But I guess there was no way it'd get a nom. 

It would've been nice to see Place Beyond the Pines get a nod, but it's a stiff competition so there was really no room for it. 

All in all though I think there is a good bit of variety this year with the noms. Only thing I wish there was less of is American Hustle.  




 Honestly, I'm quite happy with the nominations. A lot of variety. Of course there are some snubs, there always are. But they did good this year. Only thing I'd like to see less of is American Hustle.  




 I know it's a longshot and was never going to happen, but no cinematography nom for Spring Breakers or Only God Forgives? I know it may not be a good movie but OGF was easily one of the most beautiful movies of the year. Also had a great score.  




 Just a question: Have you met every soldier? 




 You are *literally creating and giving life.* How is that selfish?  




 I believe in God and am a full on Christian, even Mormon. I do *NOT* let my religious and moral beliefs corrupt or interfere with my political or social views in any way. I'm able to separate the two. 




 Yeah I'm with you. I beat my child last week because he was being a fag. I mean, he just kept doing fag stuff. So I beat him and now *I'm* the bad guy? If he didn't want to be beaten then he should've 1) Stopped doing fag stuff, and 2) stood up to me. But he's a fag so obviously he didn't fight back. 




 I dunno dude. I partly agree with you. I was bullied super hard in elementary/early middle school. I'm in my 20s and looking back on it now, I wish I could go back with the spine I have now and put that bully in his place.

But that's kind of the thing. When you're a kid, like really young, you don't really understand that what a bully says isn't true. You're impressionable and you take it to heart. It isn't really until you're in your teens you start to learn to let things roll off your back.

But again, I kind of agree with you. 




 That's not entirely fair. 




 Exactly. There's more to the legalization of marijuana than "Stoners want it." There are plenty of economic benefits that could come from the legalization of marijuana. People who are against it obviously don't understand this and need to separate their own morals from the greater good. 




 It's funny you say you haven't seen any good arguments in favor, but I actually wrote a paper about the legalization of marijuana. I didn't really have an opinion on whether it should be legalized or not, but after discovering the economic benefits of its legalization I'm all for it! 




 I dunno dude. I went to school with a guy who killed himself. He had severe social anxiety as well as aspergers. He couldn't handle social stuff very well. This led to harsh bullying which led to depression. He eventually stopped going to school because he couldn't handle it and one day took his life.

There *are* some people who just are *not* in the right frame of mind.

I don't know though, maybe you're right, but sometimes there *are* other elements at play that mess with your head. Sometimes it isn't just depression. The human mind is a crazy thing. 




 What's the likelihood of running into scams on memphisflyer compared to craigslist?  




 I know I should, but I'm not about to go 45 while everyone around me is going 60-something. The last thing my anxiety needs while driving is people honking at me, yelling at me, and/or riding me. 




 I think something like [this](http://www.inc.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/preview/slideshows/03_9.jpg) may work. With or without the mustache. If you do choose to keep it, trim it on the sides some.

Also, because you have similar features, there's 

[This](http://www.aceshowbiz.com/images/wennpic/joel-david-moore-premiere-savages-01.jpg)

Also [this](http://www.metro.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/ENT_JoelDavidMoore_1009.jpg)

Honestly, I'd say go with either the second or third pic, shave the mustache, but keep the stubble. 




 My gamertag is my reddit username. None of my friends play so I rarely play. Would love to play with some people! 




 Same here. I'm not really good at it, but would love to participate. Seems like a lot of fun. 




 DBC? 




 I don't think so. We've seen the labor and verbal abuse slaves endured, but never really the physical abuse. 




 But probably not.

Edit: So happy I was wrong. 




 I honestly think it's because there was no more room in the Drama category. 




 So I don't have HBO, but True Detective looks really great. I love detective movies and tv shows. So is there another way I can legally watch True Detective? 









 I'm so glad he did though. I wanted it to be him or Fassbender. 




 Which sucks. I love Jennifer Lawrence but how did it not go to Lupita? 




 Or Lupita 














 Someone mentioned they'd love for Tarantino to do a 60s era spy film. I thought that sounded right in his realm.  




 I'm so excited for another Tarantino movie. But I'm just a little bummed out that it's a western. I love westerns, but I'd much rather see Tarantino do something else in a different time period or location. I'm sure it'll be great though! 




 The body of Henry Cavil and the voice of Benedict Cumberbatch. 




  I ordered a PPV movie when I was like 8-10. I thought the dude and chick were conjoined twins. 




 I think because it was one of the first movies to take an extraordinary situation and make it ordinary. Pulp Fiction was one of the first movies to be filled with dialogue and conversations that normal people would have. They were realistic. Not everything they said was important to the story or was dramatic. A lot of people don't like the whole "talk about nothing" style. But I loved it. It made it feel more realistic. In the beginning, Travolta and Jackson aren't talking about anything important or meaningful. They're talking about tv and fast food.

But on top of all that, it's just a well written, well acted, and well directed movie. 




 Hot Wheels.

In a dystopian future, the most popular sport is car racing. But the cars are super fast. Going up to 500 mph. The tracks are filled with crazy turns, jumps, and loops, making it the most dangerous sport. A young man, who has dreamed of being one of the best racers attempts to make his dream a reality. 




 See I don't see Jeremy Renner pulling off the comedy parts. I think he's a perfectly capable actor though. 




 They do actually snort it. It's uncomfortable, but harmless. 




 Like I said, my blue sky analogy sucked and was not meant to be taken literally. Just as a way to put things into perspective.

Well Jesus was whipped and had a crown of thorns placed on his head and, apparently, bled from every pore. He was covered in blood, yet when he was resurrected his scars were gone and the blood was clean from his body.

You're exactly right. We *do* have to consider that maybe other religions are right.

Look, I'm just going to assume that you have no intention of coming to any sort of agreement and you just want to argue. I'm trying to compromise with you, but you won't. I can't tell if you're asking these questions and pointing this stuff out because you actually want explanations or because you're trying to prove that all Gods and religions are all just a lie. So let me know. Are you *really* interested in answers? Are you asking because you want to believe? Or because you want to prove something? 




 I think it depends on what *you* like and also, who you're seeing it with.

I loved Wolf of Wall Street, but depending on who you see it with, it can get pretty uncomfortable. If you're going with family or a girlfriend/boyfriend, I'd say Lone Survivor. But if you're going with a buddy, you can't go wrong with either. I loved Wolf of Wall Street *and* Lone Survivor. But I thought Lone Survivor was more entertaining. That's just me though.

But again, it depends on what you like and who you're seeing it with. 




 It's cliche, but I want to improve my health. I used to be in good shape. Now my pants and shirts are tight, ripped a few pants actually. It makes me sad. I want to lose weight and get back in shape. I want to look and feel good. 




 Jamaica. I didn't feel safe there. Does this make me racist? No one there did anything to make me afraid, but I felt uncomfortable. 

Anyone who has been to Jamaica a few times or lives there know if it's actually dangerous or if it's pretty cool? 
























 Man I wish I knew how to do custom covers. Those custom Harry Potter covers are sick! 




 It really sucks how the UK gets all the cool steelbooks. Really wish the US would get some. 




 Why? Out of respect? If so, why? I mean, it's not based on the Malaysian flight. Hollywood doesn't seem like the kind of business to really care about anything but money. In fact it's weird that they don't want to capitalize on it. Besides, this is a movie that probably wouldn't be released for another year or so. I don't disagree with their choice but it's strange.  




 Whether it be by telling you how it ends before you saw it, or pointing out something that you can't unsee or hear. 

What movie was ruined for you by someone else and how? 




 Honestly, I only think two of Kubrick's films are great. 




 I'd love to hear why you think Inglorious Basterds is one of the worst movies you've seen. 




 I agree with all of your points. Also, Tree of Life is one of my all time favorite films. 









 "Then I woke up." 









 I only know this from An Extremely Goofy Movie.  




 Haha well I just got off work so I'll get in contact with you in like an hour 




 You know what? I just might skype you. Are you available after 8? Cause I really do need someone to walk me through it in real time.

 I can't edit clips independently anymore now. Now I have to create a new project and drag the sequence into a new time line which combines everything. I can't adjust single clips and what not. How can I fix this? I don't want to re-edit the entire thing all over again!   




 FCP 7. I don't know what my sequence/project settings are or the export/master file settings.

I have run into another problem though. So on this project I have put 30 hours into, I accidentally closed the sequence timeline. Now the timeline won't open for this specific project unless I create a new project and drag the sequence into this new timeline. Problem is, when I do this it makes it all one big sequence where I can't see the beginning or ending of clips. I also have to re-render everything which will take two hours.

How can I fix this mistake? Can I even fix it? I just want to edit independent clips again without having to re-edit every single thing all over again. Did I royally screw up?

Edit: Never mind about the timeline thing. Fixed it! But I do still need help exporting. How do I check the settings? 




 So I shot something in 1080p 24fps. I've edited it and I'm ready for exporting. The problem is no matter what I do, it ALWAYS IS TERRIBLE QUALITY!! The aspect ratio is distorted and the image is blurry/pixelated. 

I've watched so many different tutorials about exporting, all with the same result, Bad Quality. For some reason I just can't get it to work. It's so irritating. 

The worst part is that I've exported a video that came out in high quality before, but I can't get this video I just did to come out in HD at all for some reason.

Can someone please, please help?  




 But you should watch "Them" which is a French film from like 2007 I think. Basically The Strangers in France however it is much much scarier.  




 What is this from 




 Links are more than welcomed! 

I was thinking about this while I was listening to the live version of Dave Matthews "Crush" and finding that I loved it more than the studio version. 

What are some of your examples of this? 




 Links are more than welcomed and are encouraged, but don't worry about it! 









 Spy/secret agent films. I love love love these kinds of movies. Unfortunately the only good ones we get now are really just Bond but I love this genre. 

More specifically I love mountain climbing movies like Vertical Limit and A Lonely Place to Die. We rarely get movies like this though which is a bummer. 

Someone already said this one so I won't go into detail, but I absolutely love crime movies. I'll almost always pick a crime movie over any other.  









 Honestly, Terrence Malick. He makes beautiful films with beautiful people. He's probably the only director who could seamlessly transition into that industry.  









 I personally just felt that it was very mediocre compared to the first and had bad cgi, bad cinematography and often hammy performances. 

The first one felt like a masterpiece whereas this one felt like a cheap direct to dvd sequel.  




 It was basically a four square shot of a stand up comedian's joke about Tiger Woods claiming to be a sex addict. The post seems to have just vanished 




 The majority of people think Johnny Cash's cover of Hurt is better? 




 Too bad it's also 10% as good as the first one.  




 It's weird we have to learn to protect ourselves from the very people paid to protect *us*.  




 So there was a story about I think a WWII pilot who was flying in the Bahamas and disappeared. They then found the wreckage off the coast of Florida and never figured out how he got there. 

I could be remembering all the details wrong, but that was the basic gist of it.  




 I didn't mention it but you are so totally right. 

The first 300 only really used cgi for the background, blood, and the cases where that's the only option(like the army of millions of Persians and the creatures) but even then it wasn't terrible. The cgi in Rise of an Empire felt very fake and a lot of the time unnecessary.  




 So I'm definitely in the minority here based on the rest of these comments. 

I found this movie kind of boring. I don't know why but I never got into it at all. 

The blood looked super terrible. I think it might have been worse than the blood in the first one, which evaporated in the air. Like it was very distracting how bad it was. 

The cinematography was mediocre. You know how that show Spartacus felt like a cheap rip off of 300 when it came out? That's how this one felt, a cheap rip off. I found it very hard to tell what was going on at any time because of the either too dark lighting, or too bright and bloomy lighting. 

I feel like this isn't hardly half the movie the first one was. I was more interested in this movie when it was called Xerxes and was about his origins which was only 10 minutes of this movie. 

All in all I thought it was very poor and a disappointing sequel to one of my favorite movies. Again, I know I'm in the minority here but these are just my thoughts on it.  









 If /r/truefilm seems intimidating, /r/casualfilm is a great place. Easily my favorite subreddit.  




 I was wondering when someone would say this. I've seen just about all the movies people have said in this thread. 

Martyrs is possibly the darkest and most depressing movie I've ever seen. It made me feel ill.  




 I really love movies where a character is constantly being hunted or is hunting someone else throughout the entire movie. I find that these types of movies make for some really suspenseful and thrilling experiences.

What some good movies like this? 




 I was thinking about this at work today. Are the some good movies where the good guy(s) and bad guy(s) end up having to team up for some reason? Maybe fighting a common enemy? 




 Yep this is it exactly 




 So this dude came into my work looking for crystal rocks and metal shavings. He goes on to tell me about the "____ in the air" How it's in the snow and rain and is like fiberglass falling from the sky. 

Anyone know what this is? What it's called? He kinda sounded crazy so he might not be accurate but when he said this one word, the word I'm looking for, I knew what he was talking about. He said, "Have you heard about ____?" 









 Wow this was totally my idea in the first place as a joke, but I'm happy someone is actually making it happen! Exciting!

 I honestly don't think anyone could do Archer. What makes Archer Archer isn't his looks, it's his voice, which no one could do.  




 Note: I have not seen Dallas Buyers Club. 

I would have given it Best Supporting Actor and Best Actor as well as Best Director. That said, I'm really happy Jared and Matthew won in those categories because I really love them and wish them the best.  




 It's just that exactly. Hype. 




 It's not as great as all the hype and awards would lead someone who hasn't seen it to believe. Much better movies have won less. 




 Children of Men is a better movie and got no oscars 




 Children of Men is better and won no oscars. 




 It won't 




 Honestly I didn't even know it had music until the final scene. 




 That's still hoping for a lot. I loved Her but hype is a powerful thing. As much as I want Her to win, I wouldn't be surprised if it lost. I hope I'm wrong. 




 See everyone says this and I think it doesn't sound like the compliment people mean it to be. You say it with good intentions, but it's actually a knock against a movie if it's not as good in one format as it is in another format. Anyone who says "see it in theaters" or "see it in 3D" are basically saying that it won't be as good on a small screen or in 2D unintentionally. 




 Yeah Lubezki did and is a fantastic cinematographer 




 That movie was robbed of its cinematography award. 




 AMA for the pizza dude 




 He even gave it to someone else just like the real one would do. 




 So sort of like Ridley Scott with Alien. How he managed to not only create a movie, but an iconic universe as well? 









 We've seen threads before about who we think are great directors, writers, actors, etc., but what do you think *makes* these filmmakers great? What makes a great filmmaker? 









 But how difficult is this to do as someone with little to no audio experience. Just figuring out what I'd need seems like a big challenge. 




 That's fair. I should've said that while on Amazon it says $600, I actually found one on sale somewhere for around $350, which I guess, is still more. 




 Are they bad simply because they *are* actually bad? Or is the Bose actually good but you're saying it's bad because there are better options? 

I just simply don't have the time to learn about audio and have an entire day or more of trial and error figuring out how to make it all work. 

I'm not saying your input is bad, any and all input is greatly appreciated, I'm just trying to figure out if the Bose is a decent sound system, not compared to something I could build better, but as far as packaged home systems go.  




 So we got our tax refund and we want to buy a sound system for our home theater. Right now we're deciding between these two. I was wondering if I could get advice on which is better because I know very little about audio.

 Fall/winter I have this old Plugg jacket from 8th grade. Still fits and looks great. It's olive green and has a nice taper in the sleeves and waist. I've had it for close to 10 years. Very very durable. It's been through a lot. 

In the spring/summer it's black basketball shorts. That's what I wear *all* the time when it's hot. Not really fashionable, I know, but because they are solid black they look decent for these hot summers my city's known for.  




 It's like 6-10 hours depending on traffic and stops 




 Yeah Dallas is kind of far for me to drive unfortunately but it's the closest she'll be to me the entire tour so it's worth it 




 I might end up going alone if a friend can't go. It'd be nice to hang out pre show or maybe, if by some chance, our seats are near each other, during the show. Concerts are always weird by yourself. At least for me they are. Anyway, just curious. 




 I really love Born This Way. It was the first song of hers that I heard and really loved. Before that I had just been a casual fan who listened to her on the radio. I also love Bad Romance, Monster, and my favorite might be Dope. I love how personal and reserved it feels compared to most of her songs. 

It's hard to pick just one from Artpop because that whole album is more my style. 




 Thanks! Another question, how worth it is general admission? I know this is more of a personal preference sort of thing but how much more am I going to get out of the show if I do GA vs regular seating? Is it worth waiting in line all day, to you personally? It's just that I've never done GA before. 

You also said if I showed up later, I'd get the back. How terrible is the back of GA? Last one, is there a chance that if I showed up late for GA that they'd run out of room and I wouldn't get in?

Again sorry for all the questions. You're very helpful! 




 So I have a question, does this mean I'd have to wait there all day to get in? Like, for example, if I get there at 8 am, do I have to wait there in line until like 8 pm or whenever it starts, to get in? Or can I chow up at 8 am, get a ticket, leave, then come back when the show starts? Also, how much are GA tickets?

Sorry for bombarding you with questions, you just seem like you know. Thanks in advance! 




 I cried during the last scene.  




 I can't even comprehend this, it's so great. 




 I think *Gravity* is *way* too high up on this list I think it's the most surprising one. I kind of expected it to be on the list, but definitely not that high up.. I can't believe the movies that it's ranked higher than. Should definitely be in the 200's at most. I know this list is less about "best" and more about "favorite", but even by that standard *Gravity* has to be one of the more overrated ones on this list. 




 Naw the song I'm looking for is far more recent. 




 It was a female singer. Obviously she didn't really say "something", but I can't for the life of me remember what the lyrics are or what song. 

Any ideas? 




 Lights out!

Guerrilla radio! 




 Yeah he's still young and impressionable. I'm sure him seeing all this stuff must really mess him up.  




 I choose a movie based on what my mood is at that time. Like am I in the mood for crime, action, comedy, etc. as well as sub-genre stuff like dark movies, violent, gritty, depressing, fast paced, light-hearted, etc.

A good way to find subgenres is Netflix. You can find a vast list of sub-genres or you can find a movie you've seen that is close to what you want to watch in tone and Netflix will say "This movie is: Violent, dark, etc." and will tell you what tone it is. You can then click on, let's say "dark" if I wanted to watch a dark movie, and Netflix will list all of the movies it has for instant that are categorized as dark.  




 1993 - either Jurassic Park or Schindlers List. Probably Jurassic Park.  









 Like when something happens in a movie that you've been waiting or wanting to happen. Or when a character dies or when something happens in a movie that you just find so satisfying.  




 Its just always fascinated me how a games graphics could be so heavily improved but I don't understand how it's done.  




 It's like Russian roulette for your mouth.  




 The food storm in Kazaam. When Max wishes it will rain junk food and it just French fries, burgers, candy, and pancakes everywhere.  




 I completely agree that sequels work for comic book movies. It makes sense. I'm just saying for me personally I'm not a huge fan of sequels. 

And as for comic book movies taking over original films. I guess I just meant adaptations and remakes in general. As the years go on, the number of original films are getting smaller and smaller. Everything is based on a comic or book or a remake or sequel or reboot. I can't say I blame Hollywood. If I knew a specific thing would sell, I'd make it too. 

And again, adaptations of comic books and remakes and what not wouldn't bother me if they did something interesting with them. But they all feel the same which makes me feel jaded towards them.  




 I dislike the Godfather a great deal, but I recognize its a great film.  




 I can honestly see Shia making a comeback in like 5 or so years. Just imagine it for a second. He makes a huge mistake and decides to roll with it. For the next five years he disappears from the public eye. And when he does appear, everything he says is a quote from someone else. Then after years of being hidden he comes out of nowhere starring in a film with a great director and blows us all away.  




 I'm not really into them honestly. They aren't bad though. I really love the Nolan Batmans though because they didn't *feel* like a comic book movie, if that makes sense. When they first made an impression in like 2008 I liked them but I feel like now there is just such an over saturation of them. Honestly for me, my main problem is the fact that they are sequels and adaptations. It sounds shallow, but I'd much rather see an original film than another Marvel or DC movie. But it wasn't this way like 5 or 6 years ago because there weren't so many. We use to get super hero stuff like every two years or so. Now we get them every year. Sometimes two or more a year. 

I also don't like, and this is more a flaw with Hollywood than super hero films themselves, that producers are just looking for properties and franchises to adapt or remake simply because they know it will sell, thus creating less and less original content. These days, comic book movies are replacing original films. It used to be adaptations were made along side original films. Now it feels they are taking the place of original films. Again though, this is more a problem with Hollywood. 

I'm not totally against super hero stuff as long as they change it up or do something interesting with it. That's why I loved the Nolan Batmans. But now, every Marvel movie looks the same and every DC movie looks the same. They all look and feel the same. That combined with how frequently we see them makes them feel super dull and dry to me. 

Like 10 years ago, I'd be so pumped for the next super hero movie. Now, they just aren't special anymore. At least to me it feels that way.  




 This is actually pretty true! I went through a bunch of guys with their penises all out then they would leave immediately when they saw I was a dude. Then this one dude didn't leave immediately so we started talking and had a really nice conversation. Turned out to be a pretty cool guy.

 And the best thing about Jurassic Park 3.  




 Mayo? 




 I don't think Beyond the Black Rainbow is particularly great, but I do love that movie.  




 This is seriously a fantastic movie! 




 I honestly don't remember anything about this movie but I *do* remember liking it.  




 Wait, Dancer in the Dark is on streaming? I've always wanted to see it.  




 This is sort of why I hope Gravity doesn't win best picture, not that I think it will, but hype is a powerful thing. Especially in an awards show that has slowly become a popularity contest. I think Gravity is really good, but I've always thought that best picture should be reserved for timeless films. Films that are just as great and just as powerful no matter the format, no matter the screen size. I agree that Gravity will lose a lot of its powerfulness with its transition to small screens. The same happened with Avatar.  




 I'm subscribed to a few youtubers who do reviews that I trust. I also look at the discussion threads on /r/movies that they have every week. I find that I trust the opinion of the general public more than a pro reviewer. I don't know why, I just do for some reason.

For the most part though I generally don't look at reviews. If it's something I want to see, then I'll go see it. If it's something I don't really have an interest in seeing, then I'll likely stay away from it for the time being.  




 What if there's no IMAX near OP? And if there is, what if it's not playing? Will he/she have a lesser viewing experience? 




 I'm not really into ghosts or possession movies, but I love creature films with physical creatures or monsters. What are some decent ones besides the classic ones like Black Lagoon, Wolfman, etc.? Like more recent ones?

Edit: When I said classics I should have been more clear. I meant the ones people always say as well like Alien and the Thing. I meant more recent and more obscure creature films.  




 I'm looking at a bunch of steelbooks and about 90% of them are region b, or the UK, or only just Europe. Is there a reason for this? Why doesn't America get them as well? 




 I want to find more rare editions or limited editions of movies, but the thing is, I don't know which movies have other versions or editions. Is there a website that list them or I can use as a resource? 




 I watched Punch Drunk Love, and I was wondering if you guys had any favorite unconventional love stories in movies. It doesn't necessarily have to be a romance movie either.  




 I really *really* love the big forest scenery in movies like The Hunted and even the Twilight movies have nice forest scenes. Are there any movies that take place predominately in the forests of Washington or Canada? Or even Alaska? Or other forests/wilderness like the ones found in north eastern America and Canada? 




 What are your favorite box arts or covers? Whether they be special editions, steelbooks, or just regular covers, which are your favorites? I'm a big fan of the box art for [The Thin Red Line Criterion Collection](http://www.amazon.com/Thin-Line-Criterion-Collection-Blu-ray/dp/B003KGBIRA/ref=sr_1_3?s=movies-tv ie=UTF8 qid=1391655340 sr=1-3 keywords=the+thin+red+line) 




 See I disagree with this because everyone has *their own* problems. All of my problems *are* relevant to me. That's what makes the *my* problems. If they were irrelevant to me then they aren't my problems. Everyone's problems, no matter how big or small, are relevant to them. Maybe not to someone else, but to them they are. My complains and problems may be less important than someone else's but that doesn't make them less important to me. Like when I was younger and I would complain about having hard homework and my mother would make a comment about third world children not even having a school. I understand that it's a big problem, but it doesn't make my homework any easier, it just puts things into perspective. 




 I watched a movie called [Three O'Clock High](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094138/?ref_=nv_sr_1). I love love *love* this movie. It's about your average high schooler, Jerry Mitchell, who finds himself challenged to fight the new guy, Buddy Revell.

Buddy is the new guy who, according to rumors, is a psychopath. He doesn't like to be touched. The last guy who touched him had his arm broken. Buddy is your typical bad boy. He wars boots, jeans, black leather jacket, and a white t-shirt. When Jerry Mitchell introduces himself, he puts his foot in his mouth and can tell he's making Buddy angry. In an attempt to fix the situation, Jerry asks if they can start over and gives Buddy a nice friendly pat on the shoulder. Psycho Buddy warns Jerry of what he's done and tells him that they are going to fight in the parking lot at 3 o'clock. Jerry then spends the movie trying to get out of it by any means possible.

This movie is exceptionally well made. The pacing, directing, and camera work are all absolutely fantastic.It's such an easy movie to watch because of how well paced it is. We constantly aware of what time it is and how much time Jerry has left. I cannot stress enough how fantastically well made this movie is. It's so much fun.

The thematic elements we see and hear throughout the film are really well done. For example, Jerry is in Biology and watching the Wonderful World of Insects. We hear the narrator describing the grasshopper who is going about his day and is preyed upon by the large crab scorpion. Another instance in English when we hear about the gladiator battles.

All in all this movie is great. If you're a fan of movies that take place in a day, this is one of the best ones. It's well made with fantastic direction and the pacing is great. It's an immensely fun movie and I highly recommend it.  




 So just yesterday I watched [Exam](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1258197/?ref_=nv_sr_1) which is about a group of people who are all competing for a high ranking job at a top of the line company. They must decide whether to work together or alone in order to figure out the simple yest complicated test they are given that puts them to their limits.

This film is a very tight psychological mystery. It opens with eight applicants who enter a testing room. They are greeted by their test giver who gives them a few simple rules to follow. They are told there is one question and only one answer. However they must figure out what the question is as well as the answer in under 80 minutes.

We spend the movie in an almost real-time fashion watching these people trying to solve this strange mystery. It's hard to describe without spoiling it, and this is not something you want spoiled. The acting is mostly good while occasionally, but rarely, coming off as hammy. The writing is pretty tight while rarely being cheesy. The stand out in this film is the story.

This is a very interesting mystery puzzle of a story. Why are these people here? What's the job? What's the company? Why is the application process like this? What's the question? What's the answer? Over the course of the movie we watch them slowly try to solve these questions. The writers did a great job of creating this quasi-futuristic world and the conflicts it faces. Again, it's hard to talk about without spoiling.

While watching this I got two vibes from it. Cube and Reservoir Dogs. Two very different movies. 

I seriously recommend checking this out. Especially if you love a great mystery. It's on Netflix instant.     




 A few days ago I watched [The Iceman](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1491044/?ref_=nv_sr_1) in which Michael Shannon plays notorious mob hitman Richard Kuklinski.

I thought the movie was very interesting. I had never heard about Kuklinski before I saw the movie so it was all new information for me which made it that much better because I didn't know a thing. The writing was pretty good as well as the directing, but what really stands out is the acting. Michael Shannon, as always, is extremely powerful in this role. He is seriously one of the best actors working today. Shannon is joined by Winona Ryder, Chris Evans, Ray Liotta, and a surprising David Schwimmer. Everyone in the cast does a great job. The stand outs were obviously Shannon and Chris Evans, or at least for me they were. It was nice to see Schwimmer in a *very* different role than normal. However, I kind of chuckled at Ray Liotta. Not because he was bad, Liotta is solid in this. I chuckled because Ray Liotta has to be one of the most typecasted actors today. I'm sure 90 percent of his career is gangster/mob stuff. Not that I'm complaining.

It's easy to overestimate an actors performance, but this movie is great because of Shannon. Without him I think it would have been just good. 

I got a Zodiac vibe from it. Mostly because they are both period piece crime films that take place over a decade. Which brings me to the other thing that stood out to me. The costume and set design. I totally felt that I was there in the 60s and 70s.

All in all I strongly recommend checking this out if you haven't. It's seriously a great film that really shows how powerful Michael Shannon is on screen. His presence is almost God-like in its power. It's on Netflix instant so give it a watch sometime.  




 Why what were you going to say? Please continue to contribute! 




 This is actually *exactly* what made me think of the quote from the movie I'm looking for. When I saw that ad I turned to my cousin and said, "It's just like in that movie when the kid is told to run home and runs to his actual home saying run home, run home." 




 Yes! This is it! For the past few days I've been saying this quote to myself trying to figure out where I heard it and whenever I typed it into google, all I got were home run videos. Thank you so much I can sleep now! 




 So yeah there was this baseball movie where a kid is told to run home so he runs to his house saying "run home run home" 




 Dude again I never said it was a bad post or it should be removed. I like it! No, image macros suck. Mods already said that those are pushing it. It may be half gaming related but that means it's 50% irrelevant as well. My first comment was downvoted because I made an observation. Then my second comment was downvoted because I was simply saying that I did like the post but just thought it'd be better suited somewhere else. I'm not being disrespectful to anyone.  




 I know we're pretty lenient with the rules around here but I'm sure this interferes with rule 1 somehow. I'm not saying this post sucks or it should be removed. I think it's hilarious! But I think it's better suited somewhere else like /r/Funny. It *barely* has anything to do with gaming besides the background and coloring.  




 The comments here suck 




 But don't people only do dangerous stuff for the adrenaline rush and to look cool? Like skydiving or free climbing? 




 I thought that the PS2 one was based on the movie Narc 




 Kind of related question, does anyone know the release date for the second episode of The Walking Dead Season 2? 




 Wow. A post about a movie character made it on the front page of /r/Gaming.  




 Mim looking for movies that are like Children of Men or The Road. Like movies where a character or group of characters have to travel through and survive either a war torn country or post apocalyptic world. Like where it's more about a journey the character(s) have to make through that world in order to get to a destination. 

Can you think of any movies like this? 




 I always thought Bradley Cooper would be a great choice.  




 [Smokin' Aces (2006)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0475394/?ref_=nv_sr_1)

When a Las Vegas  performer decides to testify against the mob, they put a hit on him that brings together all sorts of crazy characters and assassins. This is a very fun action/thriller. 




 It's not the best, but I really *really* love the opening scene of [Narc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xfrmlcIQf4) 




 But I feel like this one is going for a comic book feel way more than Spiderman 3. So I think this one can get away with it.  




 This was my huge beef with GTA V. I fell about 50 feet and only lost about half health. I did a front flip down some stairs and died instantly. 




 Like for example, the hero is driving a car and the bad guy shoots at him and we, the viewer, see bullet holes and shattered glass. Do they put charges in the glass, or what?

I know when they do squibs, or blood hits, the actor wears an explosive blood pack. And wall hits are just pockets in the wall with tiny explosives. But how do they do glass? 




 And that you have to be an experienced professional and not just some dude. Thought I could just apply to be a gaffer but it looks like their looking for bigger pros.  




 Yeah it have a lot of respect for Heder. It must be so hard to be an actor and Mormon. Having to turn down roles. I respect that he sticks to his morals. There are quite a few famous actors who use to be Mormon but stopped practicing in favor of roles.  




 Not really any movie in particular, but I love on set b-role footage. I also really love special feature that look at how a movie's special effects were done. And I prefer these extras to be lengthy and not just a short 5 minute montage or compilation. Like the in depth on set footage or SFX stuff.

Spider Man 2 had literally hours of behind the scenes stuff.  




 I'm don't read comics but I had it spoiled for me when I looked at its IMDB. 




 I don't mind Bruno Mars and I think he's talented, but man I was so bummed when I realized it was Bruno with special guest Red Hot Chili Peppers and not the other way around. 




 Wait, so Bruno Mars is the star and The Red Hot Chili Peppers are the special guest?! Screw that 




 Can I get a gif of the "jazz hands" from the two dudes from the Seahawks and Broncos? Anyone know what I'm talking about? 




 Eli looked like Scar up in the box watching his brother Mufasa. 




 This is sad. It's a cold reminder that actors are still just people and they won't be around forever. It's always a weird feeling when you realize that you won't see someone again. It's always shocking and never easy to believe when someone dies. He was easily one of the greatest actors. He won't be forgotten. 




 Spy films. We really only see James Bond and we only get that like once every five years or more. 

Also noir. Like good classic style noir. Nicolas Winding refn is bringing it back in a way, but there is still a lack of it.

Lastly, hard, cerebral sci-fi. Today so many sci-fi movies are all about cgi, huge explosions, and lots of action. We don't really see sci-fi that focuses more on world building and story. Her was a great step towards getting back to hard sci-fi, but we need more of it. 




 I really liked how classic rock was used in a Knight's Tale. It contrasted with the times, yet it worked so well.

Another recent use I really loved was the use of The National's song About Today at the end of Warrior. I won't go into too much detail because I don't want to spoil this fantastic movie. But it perfectly captured that moment and broken relationship between two brothers and their father. 




 But that's sort of what I'm getting at. Movies *are* a visual media but I don't think that should mean visuals should come first. I'm not saying that Gravity's visuals come first, but it sure appears that way when the visuals drown out the story. Story is important. Especially if we're talking Best Picture. It's perfectly okay for a story to be simple. But there's a difference between simple and shallow. Children of Men wasn't even nominated in any acting categories, best picture or director. I may be in the minority here, but I believe Children of Men is a league above Gravity. Best picture should be a well rounded film, which I honestly don't think Gravity is. But again that said, I still think Gravity is a technological achievement in film.  




 [The Thin Red Line](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120863/?ref_=nv_sr_3) (1998), Terrence Malick 




 I never criticized Gravity's story. I never said it was bad, I just simply said it was similar to Avatar and American Hustle in that the story wasn't the best part.  The thing about Gravity is that it's okay to have a simple story. But it felt like the story wasn't important. You could tell that the tech was more important. When you have complex and bombastic tech and visuals, it overshadows the simple story. The story wasn't just simple, it was kind of flat. A story can be simple, but I feel it needs depth. Great stories are not determined by how complex or simple they are, but how much depth they have.  




 So when I was looking at the awards poster for Gravity that was posted on here I started thinking. I found Gravity to be one of the most technically impressive movies I've ever seen and it is an accomplishment. But I can't help but feel that it's a little over-hyped.

I find myself reminded of Avatar. Avatar is a technically impressive film of the same caliber as Gravity, I feel. Yet Avatar's plot was "meh". I feel the same about Gravity. Again, it's a technically remarkable film, but I feel that that's really all it has going for it. The acting is good and the plot is also kind of "meh".

Today, Avatar is a movie we don't think about to often, and while impressive on a big screen, it loses a lot of that impressiveness on a small, home tv. Going back to the awards poster for Gravity, one of the quotes says, "A groundbreaking film that must be seen in Imax 3D." Which is exactly like Avater. I worry that Gravity will not be as impressive on smaller screens resulting in a less powerful film because Gravity does rely a lot on its technical aspects.

I'm also reminded of American Hustle in a way. The general consensus here is that American Hustle has great acting but a "meh" plot, and a film shouldn't be considered great based on just one aspect of it. I think the same could be said for Gravity. The strongest, and really the only thing it has going for it, is its technical achievements. Now, I do realize that Gravity and American Hustle are two different beasts. And I do want to say that I'm not hating on Gravity because I think it's a really good film that has made incredible leaps in its technology. These are just observations I've made.

Edit: Just wanted to point out that Children of Men wasn't even nominated for any acting categories, best picture or director.  




 I have to say Napoleon Dynamite. I think it's so different from any other comedy. I love it's weird dry sense of humor. It's easily one of the movies I quote the most.

 Because /r/gaming is one of the worst subreddits.  




 I'm Mormon and I'm late to reply, but I can decide that it's just a game. I play M rated games and watch R rated movies all the time, even though we're encouraged not to. The way I see it, it's not influencing me. I'm able to separate my life from a video game or movie. In the case of GTA V, my character murders, breaks the law, drinks, goes to the strip club, etc. This is all happening in the game, sure I'm making him do it, but it's just a game. I'm not doing these things in real life so why should it matter. Same with R rated movies. I'm just a spectator, not a participant. 




 Dude...Kill List is in no way a comedy. Probably one of the darkest movies I've seen. I didn't feel good afterwords. Loved it though.  




 /r/movieclub does this every week. The community chooses based on upvotes then they watch and discuss. I'm not against having it here, but just FYI incase there are people who want to do this but we end up not doing it here.  
























 I *literally* just bought this for $25, I'm so jealous.  




 Oh geeze, Inside is so brutal and visceral! 




 Boy Meets World, all 7 seasons. 




 I think it works for some, like the Hulk, due to the comic book look of them, but I think it just doesn't make sense for some others like Bourne and Jurassic Park. The comic book look just doesn't fit the style of some of these.  




 "You're going to go from being a **can**cer...to a **can't**cer!" 




 Shame is easily one of my all time favorites. It's such a fantastic and emotional film. It gets some hate from people who call it pretentious, but I don't get that. Shame tells a different story we don't ever see. It was so raw and showed just how damaging sex addiction can be to ones life. It was the film that made me fall in love with Michael Fassbender. I'll see anything with him now. And Steve McQueen is now 3 for 3. 




 Yeah I personally prefer it to Mud 




 I finished my final paper. It has a title page, an outline and then the paper complete with works cited. My question is a simple question, what order should everything be stapled in? Google doesn't help

 




 "But quick, cause the more successful I get, ^the ^smaller ^my ^range ^becomes!" 




 I'm not a fan of horror movies at all. Mostly because nowadays they're so overly cliche and predictable and full of cheap scares. But I've found a few exceptions. I found 3/4 of The Conjuring great with the last quarter turning into a cliche fest. I also find The Strangers really good even though most people think its bad. Them is probably one of the best horrors I've seen along with the Descent.  









 I also am a huge Parks and Recs fan so I'm really excited to see great things happening for Chris Pratt. 




 I actually am a huge fan of Dexter and it gets quite a bit right for the most part. But just like any show or movie, it does get some wrong. I always enjoyed the scenes where Dexter was in his white room where he tested possible murder weapons on dummies.

The biggest offenders are usually action movies where lots of people get shot. That's where I find the most inaccuracies.  




 I've taken forensics classes at school so now whenever a movie has blood and gore, or lack of it, I automatically start judging the realism of it. I start saying things like "That's too much blood" or "The blood pattern is way off" It doesn't ruin a movie for me, but it's definitely something I notice now.  




 Have you ever met someone named Muhammad?

Edit:*Whoosh*  




 At first I thought she got whiplash and her head snapped back and hit the ground, so I thought brain trauma, but everyone here is saying snapped neck, not head crack. 




 Well, I mean, granted, if the webbing didn't kill her, the fall DEFINITELY would have, so I guess it doesn't matter. But I think the webbing did play a part in at least *how* she died. 




 I'm looking for movies that take place on a cruise ship. Are there any besides Speed 2: Cruise Control? 




 I love movies about vacations for some reason. What are some movies about someone or a group of people going on a vacation? Excluding the National Lampoon movies 









 Saw 30 Seconds to Mars and when Jared Leto came out he said he was really sick. Something to do with his throat. We could tell because he was extremely hoarse while talking, but he said the show must go on. So he ended up barely singing and when he did it sounded really off. I was kind of upset because I think he's a really good singer, but he sounded mediocre that night. However, I do commend him for performing while sick. 




 I think he has the capacity to be a really good actor. The dude *can* act, but he keeps picking bad roles and doesn't make the best choices in life. He was awesome in A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints. I think Shia should retire from acting for like five years. Pull a Joaquin Phoenix and just like disappear from movies and the public life, then out of nowhere, come back with a movie by a great director with a great script. 




 Guess it's not available for pre-order yet :( 









 Despite lyrics, which NIN song is your favorite based purely on the music? (Beats, rhythm, sounds, etc.)

I really love the music in The Way Out is Through and Underneath It All.  




 I'm a big fan of "Without you, without you everything falls apart. Without you, it's not as much fun to pick up the pieces." 




 If this is true that's pretty incredible 




 Yes these movies get thrown around a lot in this sub, but for good reason. They're great, and they *do* get an interesting reaction from people who haven't seen them before. Just because they get said a lot doesn't make them any less good. It just makes them popular, and there's nothing wrong with that. In fact, I think the Tree of Life is pretty widely hated. 

Also, all the movies I listed I own. I wasn't picking what reddit likes. I simply walked over to my dvd shelf when I saw this question and picked all the movies I own that have generated an interesting reaction from my friends and family.  









 I wound up seeing Under the Skin even though everyone told me to see Grand Budapest Hotel. I really really liked, maybe even loved Under the Skin. I found it to be so strange yet completely engrossing. I couldn't look away and the music was fantastic. I thoroughly enjoyed it. The main reason I saw Under the Skin was because this weekend was the last weekend any theater in my town was playing it and Grand Budapest was going to stick around longer. I still plan on seeing it, but I'm glad I saw Under the Skin before it went away.  




 What jobs or careers would give me the opportunity to work at or travel to interesting places? 




 My mother, sister, cousin, and three friends. Mostly because they just don't watch a lot of movies. 




 Children of Men, Crank, Se7en, The Raid, Reservoir Dogs, The Chaser, No Country for Old Men, Napoleon Dynamite, Memento, Moon, The Matrix, Enter the Void, The Tree of Life, Inception and Fight Club. 

These are all movies that I love showing people for the first time because they generate very interesting reactions and discussions.  




 Yeah I totally get that. It's not the best movie, but I think in terms of sci-fi, it's pretty original and executes its concept well without being overly complicated. But I do totally see how someone wouldn't like it. As a sci-fi I think it's good, but as a movie it's not the best.  




 I think it went wide release last week. And was limited the week before. Unless it went even wider release this week. 




 I really loved this movie. Very original and well done. 




 There's this crime one called [Lion and Deer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOl7S5VFYus). Takes place almost entirely in one room. 




 So at work tonight, after we closed, I locked the door then went to do closing duties like I'm supposed to. I then hear the door chimes jiggle quite furiously. I walk to the front and see a woman and two kids. Turns out that the deadbolt was locked but the pegs at the top and bottom weren't so the door kind of pulled open. It was after we closed so I simply told them with a smile that we were closed. She smiled and said, "Oh, sorry." Then left. 

So my manager came out and asked me what happened saying that someone from the offices was mad at me for "kicking" someone out. I told my manager that I simply told her we were closed. I didn't ask her to leave or anything. She left on her own. My manager told me that even so, we can't kick them out. I know you can't kick a customer out if they came in before you closed, but I figured it was different if they came in after the store was closed. 

I then come home and tell my mother what happened and she asked me if they were going to talk to me at work. I told her if they did I wasn't worried because I didn't know any better. We were closed and the registers were in the back. I then jokingly told my mother that the lady technically broke in since we were closed. My mom proceeded to take it way too seriously and started going on about how "You can't tell your managers that!" and "You don't say stuff like that. Take responsibility." We then started arguing. I was telling her that I knew that. It was just a joke. I know I can't tell my supervisors that. She was like, "Well how do I know that." 

What I'm getting at is that my mom always wants me to tell her stuff but when I do she always tries too hard to read between the lines looking for some deeper meaning when there is none. Then she did something I hate. She pity apologized me. She was all like, "Sorry you're right I'm wrong." Just don't apologize at all if you don't mean it because it only makes things worse. 

Then she said for me to drop it, meaning the argument. I can't! I can't leave this argument with me being the bad guy! I'm not wrong! Am I? 




 How would you rank it against Anderson's other films, if you could? 




 I'm going to a movie tomorrow by myself. These two movies are the only ones I have interest in that I haven't seen. I know they are two very different movies, but which should I see? I've heard good things about both. I really enjoy Wes Anderson films, but I also really enjoy some nice cerebral, low-key sci-fi, and I don't mind a slow paced film.

Would I have to be in a certain mood in order to enjoy Under the Skin? What are some other films like it so I can compare it to what I've seen before? 




 Kill List is great but so dark.  




 Ba ba ba, ba ba baran 




 Assuming that he had the same level of intelligence as me and had my memories, I'd make him do things for me because between school and work, I don't have time to do all the things I want/need to do. 




 I'm alright. Could be better. Could be worse. I'm kind of just...jaded. School in the morning and work in the evening everyday. Ready for summer. I'm happier than I've been in the past. I used to be depressed because I wasn't in school, unemployed, and had no love life. Now I'm two thirds there, so I'm feeling better about myself. I'm trying to get in shape so my confidence will build. I'm going to need it to start dating.

I miss my friends. They all work and have school, and are dating or engaged to someone so I'm starting to feel a little lonely.

Good things are happening though. This summer I'm starting work on my first feature film, so I'm really excited about that.

But all in all, I'm alright. A little stressed, but alright. 




 When it's all said and done, will I be happy with how my life turned out? 




 I, as the Rock, would get plastic surgery and make the Rock look like *me*, and legally change his name to *my* name so that I will always be Dwayne Johnson, even if I turn back. 




 Their resilience, physically, emotionally, and mentally.  




 Yeah, probably. 




 I wish girls would more often be the ones =making the first move. I hear all the time from some girls I know that no guy ever approaches them or asks them out. You don't always have to wait on the guy to make the first move.  




 In private I have full conversations with myself, but...I'm not talking *to* myself. I'm talking to some imaginary person. Carrying on full conversations and speaking for both sides. I also pretend I'm talking to an audience sometimes using the word "we" a lot. For example, "We are going to do this, then we will do this." And when I say "we" I'm including myself and the audience I'm talking to. 

I do this often, and have done it for as long as I can remember. As far as I know It's not normal behavior. 




 Free Willy 




 Memphis

Best: People here are usually nice. Worst: This place is a hole. There's nothing interesting here. 




 Besides reddit? I usually binge watch a tv show on netflix. However, I often just put on my headphones, turn on a podcast, then walk around my house eating snacks. 




 Flirting with members of the opposite sex (or same sex). 




 Why do we park on the driveway, but slowly die in the living room? 




 Night. I'm more productive then. Mostly because it's the only time I have to do anything because I go to school and work, so my days are filled. Yeah, I can't really go anywhere at night because things start closing, but I love just laying in bed writing, browsing the internet, watching netflix, or playing games, or just walking aroung my house listening to music and podcasts. 




 My fondest memories and best times have been when it was just me and my three closest friends. There's no stress, no one is being ignored, it's great. 




 Suffering for a day. Get the hard stuff out of the way so you can enjoy life. 




 The ability to be invisible only when no one is looking at you. 




 Those metallic reflectors you put in your car windshield to keep your car from getting hot. 




 It'd be all the symptoms. 




 While I agree, it doesn't matter because the majority of people *do* use IMDB as a reference point to help them decide what's worth watching or not. So even if they get a lot wrong, they have a heavy influence. 




 No Country for Old Men 









 Wow this is fantastic work! She'll love you so much! 




 No the photographer doesn't have any copyright 




 Here's a pic of her: http://imgur.com/IQHYGho

She was wearing a white dress. And the door was a cherry wood color.

Also, here's a colored pic from the same shoot: http://imgur.com/HxJ7c2I 




 The photographer she hired is being super flakey. Not answering her calls, not returning her calls, and the one time she did, the photographer refused to do it because of the "artistic integrity". Help? She needs it done ASAP 









 What youtube channels should I be subscribed to? Big, well-known ones and small obscure ones are all welcomed!  




 I really love Reloaded :( 




 I *just* finished watching season 4 and now I really just want to watch season 5. How can I do this without torrenting? 




 Xbox :( 




 So for months I've been trying to find entertaining things to do in single player(I don't normally play multiplayer because I don't have friends). I guess it could also work in multiplayer. 

Vigilante crime fighter. I mean like a real world super hero. I dress in black, wear a mask, and fight crime! Making sure I don't kill cops or innocents. This gave me hours of enjoyment! It was real fun to break up a crime or killing some gang members, then evading the police without killing them. 

I guess in multiplayer this would be more fun because you could stop and fight actual players which are more interesting than NPCs.  









 Yeah I know all this. Money isn't the issue. It's ease of use that's the problem because, like I said, I know nothing about computers.  




 When I said time consuming, I meant the process of learning everything and finding the right parts. I don't have anyone to help me build a pc that I know of.

How much do high end rigs usually cost? 




 * What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible. 

* Mostly Gaming, not multiplayer but single player on high settings, installing mods. Also maybe video editing as well. 

* What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes? 

* $850 

* When do you plan on building/buying the PC? 

* Towards the end of June 

* What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc) 

* Everything? All I have now is a laptop, so no monitor, keyboard, or mouse. 

* Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location? 

* Tennessee, US. Closest Microcenter is like over 5 hours away. 

* If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated. 

* None 

* Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU? 

* Not sure. Not really planning on it. 

* Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc) 

* None I can think of

* Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components? 

* None. Would be nice if there was a consistent color theme throughout, but not important. Something sleek looking like blacks, greys, and whites? LEDs would be cool, but these are luxuries, not necessary. 

* Do you already have a copy of Windows 7 or 8, or do you need a copy included with the build? 

* Need Windows 7 

* Extra info if required:  I don't know *anything* about computers. 




 Any starting points you recommend? Like you said, "It starts with just learning what everything does" and "Lots of questions, lots of googling, lots of absorbing". This is the stuff I find super intimidating and daunting as someone who knows nothing about computers. 




 Let's say I'm a hardcore gamer who doesn't know anything about computers. Despite whether it's worth it or not, and also as someone who doesn't have as much freetime as he'd like between school and work, how practical and realistic does building a pc seem for me?

I only ask because I don't know what to read, or when I'd have time to read. I also ask because I'd hate to buy all the parts I'd need, only to not have time to put it together.

How long was your pc building process? From finding/ordering the parts to putting it together? 




 Someone mentioned it in this thread and I think they made a good point. It's not the movies themselves I'm getting burned out on. It's the marketing and attention they get that I'm burned out on. Only a few superhero movies get released a year, which is still a lot more than it use to be. But there is a huge over saturation of marketing involved with them. Everyday it's another article, another picture, another clip, another trailer, another commercial, etc.

I don't think there are too many superhero films, but I *do* think there is *way* too much marketing and attention going into them. A lot more than is necessary. It's not just the marketing team either. It's also fans who post all these things as well. They're not in the wrong, but if they would just pull back on that, I think people would get less burned out. Because, again, there are only 3 of these movies a year usually, but we hear about them and see things about them almost everyday. I think *that's* the problem.  




 I know it's probably an obvious answer for most people, but for me it's not so obvious. I want a gaming pc, but I know nothing about computers or how they work. The task of building one seems unbelievably daunting. Even when I know what to get, putting it together and figuring it out seems beyond intimidating. Even if I did manage to put one together somehow, upgrading also seems intimidating. I don't have a lot of time for building one.

The pros of just getting a console is that it's already made. It's simple. The cons? It's less powerful and a smaller library of games.

The pros of building a pc? More powerful, more games and mods. The cons? Very time consuming and there are a lot of ways I could screw it up.

What should I do based off of what I told you about me?
 









 The second one by a long shot. Don't get me wrong, they're both great, but the second one is just incredible. An absolute masterpiece.  




 Yeah I've seen it, but that's why I want the discussion thread. I want to talk about it with other people who have seen it. 




 I really want to discuss this film, but where's the official discussion thread? The movie is now in its wide release. We have the Nymphomaniac discussion up, but not the Raid 2? 




 Speaking of bumping into people renting movies, I remember when I was a kid, my mom and I went to rent movies and bumped into Steven Segal and some chick he was with. He was also apparently renting his own movies, too. I was too young to know who he was. He looked familiar because I had seen his movies, but I didn't really know who he was. My mom, on the other hand, got his autograph. 




 Sorry, didn't mean to sound like a jerk. The question isn't bad, it's just that it has been asked a lot. But it's not just that it has been asked to death, it's also the fact that, honestly, the last thing this sub really needs is more content geared towards super hero movies. I'm not sure, but I'm pretty sure that 70% of things submitted here are superhero related.  




 This post is literally everything that is wrong with this subreddit. 




 I think it should be handled like James Bond. With every Bond movie with a new actor, it doesn't start with Bond's origins. It starts with Bond in the middle of some sort of mission.

I think super hero films should start doing this when they reboot. Start the next superhero reboot with the hero already a hero and in the middle of a mission. In doing this, you save yourself thirty minutes or more you'd have to spend with the origin. 




 Yeah I have a kit lens. I'd like to go wider though. 

As for price, since I'm renting, I can be super flexible with the price. I can work it into our budget. We have like a $1500 budget but rentals really cut the cost down because we're not buying.  




 I have a rebel t3i and I'm about to start work on a short. What I do know is I want to use a wide angle lens. What I don't know is what to look for. I have no clue what all the numbers mean. 

What are some wide angle lenses that don't produce a lot of noise and grain and have a good, clean image? Price really isn't a factor because I'd be renting the lens. 




 But Seth McFarlane's new western comedy seems to be very Brooks-esque.  




 If you think Requiem is that depressing, you should watch Martyrs. You'll probably kill yourself.

Also, I forgot to mention it, but A Moment to Remember. It's on Netflix and is about two people who fall in love, but the girl develops Alzheimer's and starts losing her memory. Man, was this an emotionally wrecking film! But I love it and it's such a great movie. You ever need a good cry, watch this.  




 Yeah, that's what's keeping me from watching it, but I love long movies. It's just finding the time that's the problem.

I actually have a few questions about it, if you don't mind.

Is it an epic? Like it takes place over years?

I know you said it's great, but could you tell me why?

How's the cinematography? (weird question, I know, but I'm a sucker for great cinematography.) 




 See, this is what I find funny. Most people say they never want to see Requiem again, but I'm the total opposite. I love this movie and have seen it numerous times. You should totally buy it because 1) It's probably cheap and 2) it's a great movie! 




 Curious as to why you consider Martin Scorsese the mater of dream logic cinema. 




 This film has been sitting in my Netflix list forever.  




 I feel like I dislike the Kill Bill movies every time I watch them. I really liked them a lot the first time, but every time I rewatch one, it just feels different. Like I'm enjoying it less and less each time. And I don't really know what it is about them that does this to me.

Edit: this has nothing to do with Tarantino. I love all of his movies but this only happens when I watch Kill Bill. I can watch his other movies over and over and still love them, but there's just something about the Kill Bill movies.  




 This gets mentioned a lot when this subject comes up, but Dear Zachary. That movie is emotionally devastating. 

Another is Martyrs. This is easily one of the most depressing movies I've seen. I felt sick and ill and depressed watching it. It's seriously just a downhill slope the whole way. Never getting better, but always getting darker, more depressing, and disturbing. I own this film but never intend to watch it ever again, which is rare with me. It just...stuck with me. For days. I felt so hollow and cold after watching it. 




 I watched a Korean film called Marathon. Man, was this movie absolutely great.

Marathon, which is on Netflix, is the true story about a young man with Autism, raised only by his single mother, who finds solace in running. After running a bunch of 5ks, he wants to run a marathon. The whole film is his training for this marathon. 

Holy crap, was this a great movie! The acting was outstanding! It's definitely a tear-jerker, but you'll be crying tears of sadness and joy. This has to be one of the sweetest, most motivating and inspirational movies I've ever seen. I felt so good afterwards. I felt like I could take on anything after watching this! I really, really love this movie. It's great. Just absolutely fantastic.

There's really not a whole lot more I can say about it other than go watch it. It's seriously worth everyone's time. 




 I watched this little indie film on Netflix called The Diary of Preston Plummer. The synopsis Netflix told me was basically, "Preston is a college student with no direction who meets a girl and she asks him to drive her all the way home to Florida." Now I was in a drama mood and I love road trip movies, so I was expecting a lovely, great, road trip drama where these two strangers get to know one another and fall in love.

I was kind of disappointed with what I got though. Instead of a road trip movie. I got a movie that really only took place in one location. The entire road trip was probably like, 10 seconds? This film takes place pretty much entirely in Florida. I only mention this because I believe my wrong expectations may have affected my opinion of it as a whole. Now, don't get me wrong, it was still a decent drama. Just not what I was hoping for.

What it really is, is a story about this guy, Preston, who drives this girl Kate home to Florida from somewhere in the New England area. He agrees because he's looking for adventure and doesn't really know what to do with his life. When they get to Florida, he finds out that her parents own a hotel and allow Preston to stay there for a week free of charge. During this week, Preston and Kate grow close and we learn more about the two of them. Especially Kate, whose family is hiding something about Kate's past from Preston. Preston becomes curious and starts to do some digging. But will his digging bring him and Kate closer, or push them apart?

All in all, it's a really sweet film with some good drama, acting, writing, and beautiful cinematography of Florida. But nothing particularly special or outstanding. It has like a 6 on IMDB, which seems about right. I'd probably give it a 6.5, though. 




 That doesn't mean anything other than I've had *this* account for a year. I've had another account and before that, I lurked.  




 This place is older than 3 years, though. 




 Like I said, that place isn't exactly the friendliest. 




 Eh, it was more about how once it changed, it stopped changing and never went back or moved forward, which, I know, doesn't make a lot of sense. It does sound contradictory. That wasn't the intention though. 




 You're totally right in every way, but the problem is, if/when I make a discussion post, I *want* discussion, but due to the whole upvote/downvote system, if people either downvote or don't vote, or just don't care, then there is *no* discussion. 




 Look, you're right that I *do* have to really look for the "quality" posts. That's kind of my problem. People either downvote or don't vote at all on almost any post that goes against what usually makes it to the front page. Since the content on Reddit is mostly ranked by the users, there's really no solution other than outlawing certain types of posts like it says in the mod message you linked.

True, now isn't the best time to make my criticisms right now, because the mods made that post, so the posts I'm complaining about aren't being made. But what the mods are doing now isn't a permanent solution. At least not yet anyways. In the mod post you linked, it clearly says, "So we're going to try something out for the month of April and see how you guys like it." Emphasis on "*try*". It's not permanent, but hopefully it will be.

You're right, though. I was too harsh on the mods. I'm sure it's difficult running a huge subreddit, and I do appreciate that they are trying to fix things. It was uncalled for, and I apologize to the mods. 




 You're right, I'm not entirely innocent. But I do feel the post I've made here that weren't successful were attempts at creating discussion topics we don't normally see. And it's not just me either. Many people have their deep, fresh, thought provoking posts either downvoted or not voted on at all. Not voting is just as harmful as downvoting. Since this website really only determines what is on the front page by upvotes, if people don't upvote new, refreshing things, we won't see them. And instead, we see super hero posts, poster posts, celebrity gossip posts, and the same generic, rehashed questions. 




 Well I don't really think it matters since really no one will see this post. It's been downvoted and because it's not one of the things I listed, even if it was positive, no one would upvote it because it has nothing to do with super heroes, posters, or any of the other stuff that always makes it to the front page.

So in the long run, it doesn't matter if this is what I call "dealing with it" because this post won't change a thing. For the record, I don't call this dealing with it. I call me being quiet about it for years "dealing with it". People complain about this sub all the time in the comments, but no one makes a post about it. Yeah, I went kind of harsh about it and was maybe overly sarcastic and passive-aggressive.

The way I see it, if this post was genuine and I really did love this sub and gave reasons why, I'd still get downvoted, no one would see it because, again, it's not related to super heroes or posters or whatever so it wouldn't make it to the front page, and the few people who would see it would just comment and tell me I was wrong and that it actually sucks. 




 Oh look at you! You're so slick!

But seriously, there rally aren't many alternatives. I love film. It's my passion. But most of the people over at truefilm are not really welcoming and are happy to tear you apart at any given moment if you sound uneducated in film. 

There's casualfilm, which is a fantastic subreddit, but unfortunately there's not a lot of activity. Maybe like 3 or 4 post a week. 

There really aren't a lot of alternatives. So it's either unsub and don't get any movie related stuff, or deal with it and get crappy movie related stuff. But I guess we do what we have to do?

If you know any other good movie related subs for quality content, I more than welcome you to point me in the right direction.  




 Seriously, I love this subreddit! When I first discovered this subreddit, it had a lot of interesting stuff and discussions. I'm glad it's not that anymore. I'm glad it's turned into what it is now! I mean, I love that everyday the front page is just super hero stuff, news and rumors for whatever big blockbuster movie coming out, celebrity gossip, or one of the same 5 questions that get asked every week!

As someone who is afraid of new things and change, it's nice to know there's always /r/movies for when you need a subreddit that doesn't change!

I'm loving that everyday I can see what new poster was released! I love all the "look at all these movies you've seen, but probably haven't" posts we've had an influx of lately! 

But most of all, I'm glad that the only discussion posts making it to the front page are the same questions we see every week! That's the best part. The last thing I want is an original or thought provoking discussion on my /r/movies front page!

But, yeah, just wanted you all to know how much I love this subreddit! Whatever it is you're doing, mods, keep doing it! It's working perfectly! This is a fantastic sub because of it! 




 This makes me super excited for it. I'm so ready for John Woo to make a return to action movies and I can't wait to see what he does with The Expendables. 




 Yeah and Bad Boys 2 is a masterpiece of action. I love both of these movies.  




 "You guys havin a killer time?"

Also, "How much you wanna make a bet I can throw a football over them mountains?" 




 Charlie's Angels. Both of them.  




 Yeah, make him a secret agent in a Cold War era James Bond type film.  




 I have a natural cowlick on the right side of my hair that makes it stick out of the side. I have yet to find an effective way of combatting it. What causes cowlicks? Is there a way to prevent it? Or fight it?

Please help! 




 So by flowing water do you mean waves? I know nothing about the outdoors.

Also, are there any more secluded areas where people don't generally go? Because I'm sure it will be busy this June, which is when we'd go. 




 Are there beaches at them? Like can I just walk up to the water? Cause I hear horseshoe lake has a lot of houses around it.  




 None of my family or friends know of any lakes besides the ones in Arkansas. Are those the closest ones or are there closer lakes?

Edit: Okay, new question: Which is easier to get to, Horseshoe Lake or Arkabutla Lake? Also, which is prettier? 




 That actually seems pretty intense 




 Really any place that is visually interesting or beautiful. Natural or man made. 




 I'm shooting a short film this summer in Memphis and I was wondering if anyone knew of some really interesting or beautiful locations. They can be either man made or nature made.  




 So another question: Since these are from different countries with different currencies, like amazon france, how would one pay for these? 




 Wow! Aren't they all pretty much region locked, though? 




 I hate you so much, I'm so jealous!! I really wish the US got more steel books. I wonder why we don't. Great collection by the way! 









 It could be worse. You could have a woman cut off your penis and throw it out the window of a moving car.  




 I'm trying to find someone to score a short film. I'm just not sure what subreddits to visit. Is there someone here with scoring experience or does someone know of a subreddit where I can find someone? 




 What would you consider good quality underwear and pants? 




 What do you do? Rub it on your thighs before you go to work? 




 I work a very active job that requires me to be mobile, but this job causes two terrible things to happen to me, sweating in my groin, which is gross, and chafing in my inner thighs from my legs rubbing together, which hurts.

Any tips on how to prevent or combat these two things? 




 I feel like I should be singing Christmas songs right now, I feel so jolly and generous! 




 I feel like its insane how people don't see a problem with changing Bond's race. He's not a racially ambiguous character. However, many times in the past when Hollywood has changed a beloved characters race, everyone was against it. 

What is it about the Bond character that makes people okay with changing his race? What if they changed Superman's race or Batman's race?

I do legitimately want some discussion on this topic but I don't dare ask /r/movies because I know I won't get any discussion there.  




 I played ep1 but I haven't played ep2 yet. Without spoiling it, what do you mean? What's different? 




 Oh no I'm talking about Spring Breakers! But I did love Mud too for the record.  




 Man I loved this movie. It was one of my favorites of last year!  




 I saw Panic Room again for like the fourth time. I really love this movie. It's such a tight thriller with no fat on it. It's just under two hours and doesn't take a brake. Unlike Contracted, which takes 40 minutes for things to pick up, Panic Room takes only 15 minutes for things to pick up. 

This a very solid movie. Not David Fincher's best, but it's one of my favorite Fincher movies. I'm actually shocked by how many people don't like this movie. Especially average movie goers. On IMDB it has a 6.3. Now I know IMDB isn't the judge of quality but a lot of its voters are your casual movie fans. This movie really seems like it would've been popular with a wide variety of people. It's thrilling, well directed and acted, and is shot beautifully. It's so easy to watch because the pacing is also great. 

I highly recommend this to any David Fincher fans or anyone looking for a great, tight thriller.  




 I watched this new movie recommended to me called Contracted. It's a body horror film. I wanted to watch it because I love body horror stuff. The friend that recommended it to me said it was super knarly and disturbing. When I heard this I immediately imagined a Cronenberg-esque movie with gross special effects. 

This movie was absolutely terrible. Like in just about every way. The story they tried to force in there was bland and boring. The acting was over dramatic. The writing was atrocious, and the characters were UNBELIEVABLY STUPID. I have never been so angry with characters before in my life. Nothing they said or did made any sort of sense. For example, and this isn't a spoiler, when the main character starts showing extreme physical deformities, EVERYONE asks if she's okay and she'll say,"Oh yeah I'm fine." And they all believe her. Can you not see she is seriously fucked up!!!

The only reason I wanted to see it was for some sick body horror and special effects. It didn't even deliver on those. Nothing really disturbing happens to her without spoiling it. The body horror stuff doesn't even start for 40 minutes. The first 40 minutes is literally just character set up. Which I understand because it is a movie after all, but they try to make you care for these characters by doing a terrible job forcing in love stories. I found myself not caring about anyone because they are all really dumb terrible people. 

This movie is boring, very poor, and isn't worth anyone's time. It's hard to even recommend to people who like horror or body horror movies because it doesn't even do well in those departments.  




 This was the first band I searched for. It's gotten better about it now. Now it has two songs from Downward Spiral, but the rest are still Hesitation Marks. 




 Why are you even here? This is over a hundred days old.  




 Scarface, the original one from 1932, but I didn't willingly watch it. I had to watch it for a class. I thought it was pretty boring. Not bad, I actually thought it was pretty good. Just boring. 

The oldest movie I *willingly* watched was The Good the Bad and the Ugly. I really love this movie a lot. It's what started my love of westerns, epics, and Clint Eastwood. It was also the longest movie I had seen at the time, which I thought was incredible.   




 It can be a true story or a work of fiction, but I really love movies that chronicle the rise and fall of characters. 




 Amazon most of the time. Or my local F.Y.E. I usually wait until like March to buy all the movies I want of the previous year. For example, This March of 2014, I bought every movie from 2013 that I wanted. And I'll do the same thing March 2015 for all the 2014 movies. It gives most the movies, besides November/December movies, time to drop in price so that every movie I buy isn't $25. Instead, they're more like $10-15 each, which I can feel less guilty about. 




 If you haven't seen it, you should most definitely see The Matrix. It's a masterpiece of action and science fiction. It had such an influence on not just sci-fi, but many other genres as well. 




 I think compared to most movies, The Matrix: Reloaded is actually pretty great, but compared to the first one, it's just good. The Matrix was such a masterpiece of action and sci-fi and had such a massive impact on culture that there was no way Reloaded could ever out do the first one. 




 But is it *good*? Like, "worth my $12" good? I am a big fan of Aronofsky, but from what I've seen of this movie, it doesn't look like an Aronofsky film. It looks like a generic action/adventure movie that could have been made by anyone. How much of an Aronofsky film is it? Because he's honestly the only reason I'd want to see it. 




 So my cousin is actually dating a guy who is related to your father. The funny thing is, I'm related to your mother. Small world. Fate finds a way, I guess. 




 That's exactly what I mean when I say he's unwilling to compromise. I was telling him just what you said and he disagreed and told me sometimes the older styles are better. 

I totally get wanting to follow in the steps and try and replicate a great director, but his determination to do this makes him very cliche and "copy and paste", and gives him no identity. No custom style. And if we want our projects to get noticed and stand out, we have to *stand out* and do something different. 

I probably sound like a douche talking about my friend because he *is* smart and very passionate about filmmaking. 

But yeah anyways. I'm not that far from you(barely). I'm in Tennessee. Not a lot of film community here.  




 I like to do more darker, bleak, surreal stuff like crime stories or dramas. He's a huge Spilberg fanboy, which is fine cause he's a good director, but it's really causing us to butt heads because he wants to do more feelgood, textbook style filming, which again, is fine. 

I like more modern movies and the only movies he has seen and love are pre 1990 stuff. Which in turn causes him to want to do dated and cliched stories and story beats. 

It's hard to explain, but his demeanor feels very much like he "owes" the "classics" so he tries to replicate that "classic" feel which honestly doesn't really work today. It really feels like he only loves classic movies because he feels like he's obligated to because every filmmaker is only suppose to like old movies. 

Anytime I bring up modern movies or modern trends and styles, he rolls his eyes and calls them inferior to the "classics".  




 Well I'm 7 days late but thought I'd still talk.

I'm in sort of the same situation. Filmmaker as well. However I do have at least one friend who I've been working with frequently. The problem is we are very different in our tastes and styles and he is unwilling to compromise, so we have started to hit walls when trying to come up with ideas.

I'm trying to broaden the amount of people to work with, but everyone else isn't as serious about it as I am. Everyone just wants to do it for fun, which is fine for them, but I want to make a career out of it whereas they have other careers in mind(doctor, lawyer, etc.,). So this leads to situations where I either have to work with my stubborn, uncompromising friend or work with people who goof off too much and don't care.

Too bad you and I don't live near each other(as far as I know. I'm assuming.). We seem to share the same interest.  




 Man, I should get Photoshop. Is it free at all? Like is there just a basic version that is free?

I frequent vgboxart.com which has tons of awesome custom movie box art and have always wanted to make/print one.  
























 Oh on the disk it had "18" on it so I just assumed. But that's good news  



















 I went to see them last October and before the show, we went to some stores. The sales associate who was in her twenties asked if we were going to the show. We said yes and she said "They're awesome! They did a really great cover of a Johnny Cash song." 




 This is my first post here and I wanted some feedback. Don't mind the numbering of the paragraphs. Those are for a personal purpose.

[Here it is](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B54RInQXb2CRU1BGSXJ6OFd6TEU/edit?usp=sharing)

Also, I wouldn't mind some title advice as well. NDE is a working one.

Thanks in advance for any advice/critiques! 




 Obviously District 9.  




 King Leonidas' [death scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj11Pj2T7Bw) in 300. It's so beautiful and tragic. His whole life he had been taught to not fear death, but in this moment he realizes what he'll be leaving behind. His love. And for the first time in his life, he feared death.

"My queen! M-my wife. My love."

Edit: Also wanted to add that it's beautifully shot and beautifully acted by Gerard Butler.  




 Weird question, I know, but I don't drink and also happen to be a non-alcoholic drink enthusiast if that's even a thing. 

I'm looking for places in or around Memphis that have good/interesting/unique/strange drinks. Sodas, juices, whatever as long as it's non-alcoholic. 

A strange request, but I'd love some info.  




 /r/Retiredgif 









 She was wearing a blue bikini I think? Also the background had a playboy symbol.  




 Max Payne 




 I think this might be the right answer. People hear Adam Sandler and they think over the top comedy. You go see Punch Drunk Love and it's Sandler actually acting against PTA's great, but unusual directing, and when you combine this with the strange story, it's easy to see people not liking it because it's not what they think. 




 One of my all time favorites. I seriously think it's one of the best movies ever made. 




 I watched it recently and it still kind of holds up well. Especially the Island of Lost Dreams one. 




 The 3 kinds of comments in this post:

"Fuck Gamestop" Yeah yeah we've heard it all before. 

"This is why I pirate games. Because I'm sending a message to the man!" No it's not. You pirate because you'd rather get something for free. 

And finally, "This should be in the game. I bet it was but they just took it out." You should not be surprised and should expect this by now. I'm with you in that it sucks, but this is normal now. In fact it's weird if games don't have preorder bonuses now.  




 Only two kinds of people use the word "rubbish". British people and snobs. I hope you're British.  




 Niell Blomkamp 




 That show is fantastic! I've been waiting for season 5 to show up on netflix 




 Watching my youtube subs is a nightly thing with me. I have netflix, but I don't watch it as much as I want to.  




 I have the [Nine Inch Nails logo](http://i.imgur.com/d57qOpn.jpg) on my finger. I like it because it's not really noticeable and it's my favorite band. 




 I miss my senior year of high school. Best time of my life. I was happy, I got to see my friends everyday, I didn't have bills or responsibilities. All I worried about was how I was going to make the next day fun.

I also had this film class. I miss that because I got to make short films with my best friends. 

I think I just miss my friends. Once I graduated, I only stayed in contact with like three of my friends and I only got to see them like once every week or two.

But yeah, I just really miss my senior year. Great friends, great teachers, classes, and a great, happy life. 




 I'll just get on Youtube. Like tonight I spent hours watching live performances of bands. It was great. Sometimes I'll just listen to a podcast while pacing around the house. 









 It's from a Korean Company called Plain Archive. To me it's like the Korean Criterion. They take certain movies and give them really great artwork and stuff. 

They do it every couple of months. But unfortunately they sell out fast. The newest one, Blue is the Warmest Color, sold out in ten minutes. If you want to stay up to date on what they're doing and new releases, I recommend following them on Facebook.  




 Under the Skin 














 "The finest cigars, the finest wine, and a .22 cal gun."

Not bad. 
 




 Naw this chick was I think Korean? She also appeared to be on a train 




 It's a short video too. Help? 




 Recently I've been thinking Brandon Routh would be pretty good.  




 I kind of hope it's more Avengers/Guardians in tone and not Xmen. Power Rangers is awesome but there's always been this fun cheesiness to it.  




 He's one of the few directors that puts a lot of work into the writing and characters

His movies are shot really well. The composition is great and there's just something about the lighting in his films. The camera work is also always great.

His writing may be self indulgent, but it is always sharp and smart. His movies are some of the few that I actually enjoy listening to just as much as watching. He makes pretty entrancing conversations between characters that really hold your attention.

I think he does a good job of pacing a story even if it is long. He knows how to move a story forward.

His films have good consistency. I don't mean his films are consistent with each other, but his films by themselves are consistent in tone.

I personally don't find his movies boring, though I can see how someone would. He makes entertaining movies that almost always have some sort of fun quality to them. 

I find him to be sort of a breath of fresh air. He only makes movies like once every couple or so years. He actually takes some time to makes sure that it's quality work. Yeah, not all of his films are perfect, but I think he still makes above average films consistently. And I do think there is some nice uniqueness to his films. Even if it's something we've seen before he manages to find a way to turn it into something different. 









 You should get The Thin Red Line and Tree of Life on blu-ray. Some of the best looking blu-rays out there. 




 Goodfellas is not as good as everyone says it is. It's a good movie, but definitely not as remarkable as people say. I have a hard time considering it to be in Scorsese's top 5.

Gravity, aside from its technicals aspects, is incredibly bland. In fact, it's pretty below average.

The Rock is not the best action movie ever. Not even close.

The Godfather is boring.

I think Terrence Malick is one of the greatest directors of all time.

I think The Tree of Life is one of the best movies ever made.

I think The Matrix Reloaded is awesome and not terrible. It's still a cut above most movies that come out today.

I think The Dark Knight is one of the best crime movies since Heat.

Only God Forgives was one of the best movies not only of 2013, but of the decade as well. 




 Romeo+Juliet is a national treasure!

Also, while I think a movie can be great with a simple plot, I think Gravity instead just had an incredibly flat, thin plot. The movie is a technical marvel, but that's where the good stops. At least for me it does. 




 But....Raging Bull.... 




 In terms of the "new" Bond films, it doesn't hold up against Casino Royale. 




 I personally think Punch Drunk Love is the best PTA movie.

Also, the piano/Brittany Spears scene is probably one of the best scenes from a film in the past decade.  




 That doesn't really make them wrong though. He's a good director and Pulp Fiction *is* kind of a good movie. This sounds more like the mindset, "It's popular so it's bad/you don't really know anything about film." 




 I can most definitely say he's one of my favorite directors and I could totally give some legit reasons. 




 Dancer in the Dark is so sick though. At least to me it is. 




 So just for clarity, are you saying that every Kubrick movie besides Strangelove is terrible or Kubrick has made some good films but Strangelove is the best? 




 So what does karma *do* in fallout? I've always had good karma in fallout, so I don't know how bad karma affects the game. 




 Yep, high speech in NV will get you through, and out of, so many things. Definitely makes life easier. 




 When I played Fallout 3, I had never played a Fallout game or an Elder Scrolls game. So in Fallout, I had no idea you could just wait. It made playing so tedious because I had to just wander around until daytime in order to go to stores and stuff.

In NV I went into the quarry after playing for only like two hours.

Also, repair is the best skill and I don't know how I could have gotten through that game the first time without it. 




 I think the last time he played a character that was different from what he usually does was Coach Carter 




 Bigger stars have started in worse movies.  




 Yep it's like a private screening! 




 Unlock the open blue sports coat you get at level 14. I wanted a sweet blue suit. Once I got it, I was kinda done with online. 




 I really want to say Only God Forgives, though I can't figure out why. There's just something about it. I can totally see it being a classic in 40 years. 




 I can't speak for everyone, but what made it great for me was the theme of fathers and sons. I have a close relationship with my father and this movie really got to me emotionally. I also really loved the fact that it felt like a Greek tragedy play with its clear three act structure. I can totally see people not liking it though. I thought the reveal of what happens to Gosling's character was a great twist I didn't see coming. 

I don't know if it will be considered a classic, but it will always be one of my all time favorites.  




 1. The Raid 2

2. The Rover

3. Under the Skin

4. 22 Jump Street

5. Grand Budapest Hotel 




 Yeah, we live in a day and age where everyone is so cynical about everything. We always assume the worst when people do or say nice things. Not everyone is trying to say something or be passive aggressive. Sure, some people are like that, but there are also people who just like being nice and helpful. There doesn't always have to be something someone is trying to get out of you by being nice.  




 I mean, don't most parents want their daughter(s) to get married and have kids anyway? I don't see how them being Mormon has much to do with that. I mean, yeah, Mormons are big about families and think its important to have one, but I feel this doesn't have that much to do with them being Mormon. It just seems like they are really pushy and happen to be Mormon as well. I mean I know plenty of people like that. Hell, my parents do the same thing with my older sister and we're not Mormon. 




 It had to do with a fox. Like all the games had this fox character and it was a series of mini games, and one mini game was keeping bubbles in the air and not letting them touch the ground. 









 I think it's awesome that we can still get movies featuring an actor who has passed.  




 I have a drumstick that was used and signed by the drummer of M83. After the final song he signed the drumstick and threw it in the crowd. It's all cracked and stuff. They may not be the biggest band but they are one of my favorite bands so it's really cool to me.  




 I think it just depends. I love working on films and tv shows. Started as a hobby then I worked for a production company for five years and loved every day of it.  




 The Raid 2 









 Context? 




 I honestly think you should see it for yourself. It's been pretty divisive. I've heard some call it one of the worst movies they've seen, and some call it one of the best. I guess it all depends on what *you* want out of a movie, and what you're looking for in one. Just make sure you set your expectations right for what it is. Know what you're getting yourself in to. If you go into it thinking it will be a post apocalyptic sci-fi action movie, you'll have a bad time. It's a drama that is set upon the backdrop of the post apocalypse and it takes its time.  




 The thing that makes Robert's performance great is that there is so much subtlety in his portrayal of his character. There's so many little things he does that make it fantastic. It's not some bombastic performance full of expressed emotion. He says so much with his expressions and mannerisms.  




 I honestly think he stole the show. Which isn't easy to do when you're co staring with other great actors. I always wanted him to be great because I knew he had the capacity to be a great actor. He really showed what he could do. One of the best, if not the best, performance by an actor so far this year.  




 Just saw The Rover last Friday and it might be my new favorite movie of the past decade.

If not that then No Country for Old Men. It's one of the few movies that is almost perfect in every aspect.

The Raid 2 is also close to being number one.

The Tree of Life is probably the movie that affected me the most emotionally the past decade.

Man, there's just too many. 




 I wish there was an option like in the Skate games where you can set a checkpoint. I'd set one on top of Chilliad and ride down it all day.  




 Yeah, I remember reading that during the uprising scene, when something messed up, they had to spend almost an entire day resetting things.  




 Tron Legacy was not only gorgeous, but had a killer score as well. Probably one of the best scores of the past decade. 




 That and the music 









 Matrix bullet time on the roof. I saw that and my jaw dropped. I had never seen anything like it at the time. 




 I have a legitimate question though. Doesn't that small percent become irrelevant if you live in an area where one of those deadly spiders live? Like doesn't the probability of encountering a deadly spider increase if you live in the native area of it? I feel like .0015% *is* insanely small, but I live in an area where brown recluses and black widows are the norm, so that small percent means nothing to someone like me. 




 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGWM4dFRc9Y 




 Right [here!](http://www.hexmedia.tv/) 









 Yeah, I think he needs some time for people to forget about him so when he comes back we'll all be like, "Oh yeah! I forgot about him!" 

Maybe time will heal and we'll forget his past. I mean people kind of forget about Robert Downy Jr's past now that he's a mega star. Then you think about it and go, "Oh yeah, he was super messed up and everyone thought he was going to end up dead."

Shia just needs to pull a Robert Downy Jr 




 Oh wow I have your autograph! Neat! I'm super excited to see it. I've been holding off watching it until tonight because some friends and I are having a scary movie night and my friends little brother will be there so I'm happy we'll all get to see it! 




 The movie was panned by most people and critics but I think it gets massive points for its creativity and originality. I love it! 




 Blue Valentine: https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage v=f4IN6NFukF0#t=67 




 From 12 Years a Slave: https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage v=lAHReSSV1IA#t=118

Strong runner up from Shame: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dE2NuKD-U4g 




 No I think he's a really good actor too, but he totally has the capacity to be a *great* actor. Look at A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints as an example. He did amazing in that. I think all Shia needs to do is completely disappear from movies and the public eye for like 5 years. Then come out of nowhere with a movie that has a great script and director behind it. 




 http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2367066/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1

I was wondering if anyone who's seen it could tell me about the content in there and how much sex, violence, and language there is. Like is it all pretty pg-13 or more R?

Friends and I are having a scary movie night and I want to watch this but his little bro who is 14 will be there also and I don't want to bring something filled with gore, sex, or f bombs.  




 Those lance explosions were just so visually satisfying. 




 Who makes them? Is there a company? Are they given the entire movie to choose footage from or are they given specific clips? How involved is the director? Are they story boarded? Who decides tone?

I just really am interested in the process because I've always wondered.  




 I wouldn't call Martyrs a horror. More like a drama where horrific things happen. It's not really scary, just sad and depressing. 




 The [Matrix Revisited](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0295432/?ref_=nv_sr_3) is like a two hour documentary on the making of the Matrix. Really really in depth.

And if you're in to behind the scenes stuff, I highly recommend getting the Ultimate Matrix Collection. It has 35 hours of behind the scenes stuff. 














 Take a movie and switch the perspective of it. What movie would be interesting to see from the perspective of one of the other characters in it?  




 I'm actually pretty excited about this game. I'm not the biggest fan of Battlefield as a series, but the idea of taking a game like Battlefield which, despite its apparent glitches, is for the most part technically impressive and then putting that into an urban environment with police sounds interesting. 

Battlefield for me has been a lot of the same recently. I think it's a cool idea to make a swat game.  




 No Country for Old Men

I think it's one of the few movies that is technically perfect in almost every single way. The writing is great. The cinematography, the acting, directing, sound design, and editing are all near perfect. 

It also has a great simple yet deep story and characters. It's also an incredibly well paced film. It never drags. It always feels so tense and so tightly done.  




 Right at Your Door is a terrible movie.  




 Man, Ivan Ooze is a great villain. He had some great lines. 




 Same here. He got a girlfriend, they got engaged, then moved in together. When you have someone around all the time you apparently don't need anyone else.  




 So how does a video rental place help me? Genuinely curious, not sarcastic 




 What's black lodge 




 I posted a couple of weeks ago about needing one actor and one actress for a short. I got an overwhelming response from the guys, which is great, but no actresses. 

Are there any local communities or organizations where I can reliably find an actress? We start shooting very soon and have found our guy but need our girl. That's all that's left for us to do before shooting.  




 I feel like the Matrix doesn't fall into this category. It's pretty much clear to the characters thirty minutes in what's real and not real.  




 I might have worded that weird, but at work today a bunch of ink spilled all over the laminate flooring. After spending hours scrubbing the floor is still stained. 

I look at my hands and see they are covered in ink. I think to myself, "Oh great, I'll be cleaning my hands forever." But to my surprise my hands were rid of any trace of ink after washing my hands for like 2 minutes. 

So what makes skin hard to stain? Why was this ink so easy to clean off my hands but impossible to clean off the floor? Did it have to do with skin, the ink, or the laminate flooring? Regardless of whether this has to do with the material of the flooring or not, my question still stands: What makes skin so hard to stain and all around resilient and resistant? 




 This very thing happened to me in the Sims 3 




 I disagree. Even though Avatar wasn't the best movie, I loved the world and universe they built. And I'm excited to see more of this universe. Apparently one of them is suppose to be about the oceans of Pandora which could turn out awesome.  




 I'm currently waiting for mine as well as the Wrestler in the mail and I'm so ready for it to get here.

Also, Art of Flight bluray. Nice. 




 I work a very physical job where the dress code is pretty lax. All we need our uniform polo and just some jeans that aren't messy. However I find working a physically demanding job in jeans not comfortable. I jokingly said to my boss, "What if I found sweatpants that looked like jeans?" to which he replied, "If they look like jeans then whatever." 




 I don't? 




 Are jean sweatpants a valid option? 




 No no I mean like a bank heist movie. I want a full movie like the Dark Knight opening. It was so entrancing to watch that opening scene. Take that, then give us a huge section of them setting it up and then pulling it off.

Edit: Sorry for my opinion? 




 That movie still holds up pretty well effects wise 




 I'm waiting for a Nolan heist movie.  




 So this pair of jeans I've had for like 2 months have just ripped. I guess from being worn out. Are there a brand of jeans that are pretty durable and will last and won't ware out or rip easily? 




 The boat reminds me of the one from Never Let Me Go 




 There are only 5 games that would get me truly excited for this new generation. Of course they may announce new IPs as well.

Skate 4 (Which doesn't seem likely)

Rock Band 4 (Which doesn't seem likely)

The next Elder Scrolls game (which doesn't seem likely)

Fallout 4 (Which could happen)

and Red Dead Redemption sequel (which who knows)

I'm just kind of not interested in really any of the already announced games. I really REALLY hope there are a good amount of surprises and new ip reveals this E3 and it isn't just more of what we have already seen. 

I haven't gotten a new console yet because I'm just waiting for that game that will make me say, "Okay, I *need* to get a new console." So far, none of the already announced games have made me say that.  




 Gatsby. Ain't no party like a Jay Gatsby party cause a Jay Gatsby party don't stop? 




 Exactly. Immersion is very powerful. My cousin served a mission in Brazil. He study Portuguese for like three weeks then left for Brazil. Didn't take him long to adapt to the language.  




 I told the people I work with that I went skydiving with my long term girlfriend who loves me. 

My coworkers now think I'm a very cool adventurous guy. I've never been skydiving and don't have a girlfriend. I'm very lame, boring, and single. It's nice having people think I'm cool for a change.  




 I was driving to work on a very rainy day. Like it was hard rain where you could hardly see anything in front of you. 

It was a four lane highway and a guy driving in the opposite lane went by me and hit a huge puddle, splashing water all over my windshield. I lost all visibility for like 3 or 4 seconds. I panicked but knew that as long as I kept my car straight I should be fine. But I hit a puddle and hydroplaned while driving blind. Went into a ditch and rolled a few times. 

I wasn't seriously injured. Just a few scrapes and was sore. But when I lost visibility and hydroplaned, I thought to myself, "This is it. This is where I die."  I seriously thought I was going to die.  




 So where are you the dozens of other times people ask questions that have been asked before? 




 A film that you already own that's a prized possession or crown jewel, or a film you long to have a part of your collection, whether it exist or not.  




 Charlie's Angels would have to be mine. What's yours? 




 So I'm looking for a new show to obsess over, but I'm looking for one that's just half an hour long instead of a full hour. The reason for this is that I have a hard time watching an hour long show because I feel like I'm not getting far into the show.

Like for example, in a 3 hour period I could watch 6-8 episodes of a half hour long show. Whereas with an hour long show I could only watch like 3 or 4. I just don't have a lot of time unfortunately. I totally wish I did cause I would totally watch the heck out of Breaking Bad and House of Cards.

I'm up for any genre. So, what are some really good and entertaining 30 minute shows?
 









 This was very well said and encompasses my exact feelings about Drive.  




 It's a romantic drama about loss, love, and the beauty of life. Cheesy, I know, but that's what it's basically about. 

And thanks for the heads up on where to post this! 




 I think it's just the opposite though. I know John Carter will be about a dude named John Carter. That title tells me *exactly* what it's about. And besides *tons* of movies have titles that tell you nothing about the movie. In fact, some of the most successful movies have titles that don't tell you what the movie is about and they did well. Also, there have been many movies where the title is just the character's name, just like John Carter.

Honestly, the title had very little to do with the movie flopping, and was more the fault of the marketing and advertising team. 




 Yeah I have an email. Message me and I'll give it to you.  




 Romantic drama with an emphasis on drama.  




 Hey sorry we do already have someone doing the score. But if you have any samples is love to hear them. I'll keep you in mind for future projects because it'd be nice to work with someone in the same city as me.  




 Yeah I'd be interested! Message me 




 Haha there is none 




 Nope. I mean it'll make it hard, but I understand. I work a job too. We all have day jobs. We would film when we can.  




 Charles is way too cool to do something like that. 




 We're looking for two actors: a guy and a girl who look like they are in their mid twenties or older. Are any of you guys interested? At all? If you are, then message me. Any questions? you can ask in the comments or message me. 

Don't worry we're legit. I mean we're not big, but we're real. We have a crew, but no actors. We could use some help finding people. We had posted on our facebooks that we're looking from people, but no responses. Just a bunch of likes. So I figured I would turn here for help.



 




 Man, that movie's great! 




 Samsara. Quite possibly *the best* looking blu ray out there. Jaw droppingly gorgeous.

The Tree of Life is another stunning film. The creation of the universe scene *has* to be seen on blu ray.

No Country for Old Men is another great blu ray addition, as well as the 2009 Star Trek.

Only God Forgives was one of the most beautiful movies to come out last year. Absolutely stellar cinematography. The look and music of this film are enough to warrant a blind buy if you've never seen it.

The Matrix is a great one as well. Especially the Ultimate Matrix Collection box set that has 35 hours of bonus features. That alone makes it worth it even if the film itself doesn't look good, which it does in fact look great!

Immortals, while a not great movie, is beautiful. Now is that enough to warrant a buy? That's up for debate, but since you can get it for a cheap price, it's not a bad addition.

Fantastic Mr. Fox is a great addition! Especially now that it has a Criterion release. This is a very pretty film that looks stunning on blu ray.

Lastly, 300. This film has some of the most beautiful cinematography of the last decade. I find it to be a must own blu ray, but that's just me.  




 I like this one because I buy blu-rays based on two things: If I love the movie and if it looks really good. 




 It's very hot and very humid where I live, and I have to wear a suit every week. How much of a fashion faux pas would it be to wear a short sleeve button down with a suit? Are there ways to make it look good? Or is it just a straight up no no?

If so, what are some ways to stay cool in a hot humid environment, while still being business formal?

Guys...it's *really* hot here. 




 My absolute favorite genre of books are crime by far with mystery at a very close second. I love Mystic River, Gone Baby Gone, and No Country for Old Men.

I'm a very visual person who really loves movies as you can probably tell by my favorite books, so it has always been hard for me to get into books. But there's just something about a good crime or mystery book that gets me super interested.

It doesn't necessarily have to be about cops either. Also, if it has some good violence, that'd be great! I also am really into crime stories that are dark, tragic and don't usually end happy. 




  'Cloverfield' should have gotten an NC-17 for use of the words shit and fuck over a hundred thousand times.

What? 




 Lex Luther discussion starts at about the 12:15 mark for those interested in only that. It's not much info, but it's Eisenberg's thoughts. 









 I know the bomb didn't malfunction and I shouldn't have said it did, but something still happened to the bomb that made them have to go in and manually detonate it. I mean you're totally right though that it was relevant to the story, but my point still stands that it's cliche. 




 I should preface this by saying that I've never seen a Godzilla film besides Roland Emerich's.

Overall  I thought it was alright, but underwhelming. I'll get to the positives before the negatives because my positives basically echo everyone else.

I thought the movie looked great and was shot really well. I also thought the acting was actually pretty great. Cranston was of course fantastic and I'm glad to see Taylor-Johnson getting more roles. And Watanabe and Olsen, despite how little their characters contributed to the story, were really great as well. Godzilla's design was fantastic as well as the kaiju's designs.

Now the negatives. The human drama might have been too much, or at least pointless. I felt Olsen's character was a little pointless and didn't do anything except give our hero something to lose.

I honestly think the final battle would have been so much better if it happened in daylight instead of night. It was already hard to see things with all the smoke, but then the darkness made it even harder to see things.

This brings me to my next complaint. I don't know, maybe it was just my theater, but did this movie look a little dark to anyone? Again, this was probably just my theater so this might not be a problem with the movie.

I found the sense of scale to be lacking. I could totally *see* the sense of scale, but I couldn't *feel* it, if that makes sense. Like the creatures looked huge but they didn't feel huge. I couldn't feel the weight. Like at the Hawaiian airport when Godzilla stepped right in front of the windows, i feel like there should've been more bass or the glass should've cracked or shattered, but it was just kind of soft for a monster that size. Also, the final battle didn't feel huge. Buildings were crumbling and falling over, but it just sounded too quiet. So I guess that's a problem with the sound design. I also thought his roar was kind of underwhelming.

I honestly think the whole military "blow up the monster/aliens with a big bomb, but the bomb malfunctions so some person/people have to go on a suicide mission to manually detonate the bomb" thing is so over-done and eye-rolling. I think it would have been so much better if the military was all like, "All we can do is just hope that these monsters will kill each other of and pray we'll survive." Like, why couldn't humans just stand aside and follow Watanabe's advice and "Let them fight"? It would've made for a more entertaining movie if it was 30% human drama and 70% monsters fighting. Instead of 80% cliche military stuff and 20% monsters fighting.

The last complaint I have is that it should have been either Godzilla vs the military with no kaiju , or Godzilla vs kaiju with very little military action. I think it was just way too much to have Godzilla vs kaiju vs military. All the military stuff should have taken a back seat, but instead, the military stuff was driving the whole thing and the monster stuff was riding in the trunk.

I know I sound like I hated this movie, but I don't. It's not a bad movie at all, I just personally found it underwhelming.  




 Parties. Seriously. Don't want people waiting in long lines outside 4 bathrooms. 









 D3 The Mighty Ducks 




 The first Saw is actually a really good movie. 




 No. No slipcover. If it did I'd keep the copy of fight club, lol. I live in Memphis.  




 A few months ago my partner and I started work on a romantic drama for our next project. At the time I was excited because the story was great and the concept was great and we were looking forward to doing a different kind of film. 

Fast forward to today and I'm about halfway through writing the film and I've just...lost all interest in it. 

Over the course of the last few months the project has been behind schedule due to life(school and work). So I've gone from being really pumped about the project to being kind of stressed and just uninterested in it. I really want to put my heart and soul into every project I work on but my heart just isn't in this project. 

It's not in my wheelhouse or my interest. I love writing crime stories and mysteries, so going from that to a romance is so...different for me. I'm never sure what to do and I'm worried the end result will be not that good with a shallow story, bad characters and really nothing special. 

I've just lost so much steam. I think that the worst part is that while I'm writing this film, there are a handful of other projects I'd rather be working on. We've had to make creative changes to our romantic drama in order to make it work and a lot of these changes were things I liked so I personally don't feel invested in it at all. 

The only thing keeping me going is that my partner *is* excited about the project. I can't just drop out. Not now. But I feel my lack of interest in the project will end up hurting the final product. 

Any advice? Any way I could regain interest somehow? Should I drop out? I'm really lost here.  




 I recently got a gift from a friend that turned out to be two blu-rays I already have. So I figured, instead of selling them somewhere because I don't know where to sell them, I'd try to trade them to you guys! I don't really know how this goes, so if you are interested in one of them, or both, just let me know! 
























 I was asked by my aunt to film my cousins engagement. My question is should I use a Glidecam or a shoulder mount? I haven't used either before but I need to be mobile. 

Also, what are some tips or advice you can give me? I've never done videography before, just fictional shorts.  




 Do they have a number? Or do I need to go there? 




 How come they aren't in sync with what they show? It seems like they contradict each other, sending mixed messages. One says this is appropriate and the other says it isn't. Who makes up the FCC and the MPAA? 









 I think all the movies you listed are great. And I think Memento should be there with them. Like I said, a true film buff like yourself doesn't think Memento is a bold film, but the vast majority of average moviegoers do. So I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree. 




 What would you consider difficult? It seems like you only consider a movie difficult if it's emotionally difficult, which is also a low bar. 




 The Maze Runner. I thought it'd be another bad young adult novel turned movie kind of thing. Went with a friend and I actually liked it a lot and thought it was a well made and above average. The ending got a little wonky I thought, but other than that I liked it! 




 The Tree of Life. I don't know how you guys feel about it, but I personally don't know anyone in my life who thinks it's good. That movie's a masterpiece. 




 It's hard to compare the two because Fight Club is this weird combo of surreal comedy/drama whereas The Game is a psychological thriller. I feel like The Game is more accessible to wider audiences because it's easier to get in to. It has a, for the most part, straight forward story that, while there may be a lot of twists, it's still easy to follow what's going on.

While on the other hand I find Fight Club harder to recommend to people because of how strange it is. It breaks the fourth wall, jumps around in time, lots of narration, it's very cynical, satirical, dark humor, at times offensive, and other times brutally violent all while maintaing this overall sense of humor and satire. I love it more than The Game, but The Game is much easier to digest. And because it's a lesser known Fincher film, I feel you'd have a better time finding people to watch it with that don't know about it, whereas Fight Club? Pretty much everyone knows about it.

All in all I like Fight Club more and think it's better than The Game, but I go to them for different reasons because they are different. While they are both good WTF movies. Fight Club only gets WTF towards the end while The Game is WTF pretty much throughout. Also, I find The Game to be Fincher's least Fincher movie, but that's just me. 




 Wait, so I don't remember anything from when Memento released. Was that pretty popular with audiences when it came out? Cause I didn't see it till years later and it didn't strike me as an entertaining popcorn flick. 




 The Master is not a bold film at all. It's great, but not bold. 




 By your logic then, Memento could totally hang with the likes of those films. You say what makes the movies you listed "bold" is that they demand something from the viewer. Memento totally demands the attention of the viewer as well as multiple viewings if you want to truly understand it all. You said Nolan isn't difficult or bold. Maybe to a lover of film like yourself. But to the general public he is. I know plenty of people that cannot sit through Memento or Inception because of the complexity of those films. To the average moviegoer, these films hurt your head to think about and they aren't the kinds of movies you can just turn your brain off for. 




 I think it's an instant classic. I think it will stand the test of time because there is nothing really modern about it. It's a movie that doesn't have a lot of modern technologies so it could've been made any time. It also feels like an old school Clint Eastwood "Man with no name" kind of movie. Sixty years from now we'll look back and go, "Yep, still a great movie." 




 I think it's different with GTA because while you have the option to do it, it's still just an option. It's not the point of the game. But with Hatred that's the entire objective of the game.  




 David Fincher - The Social Network

Christopher Nolan - The Dark Knight(Hopefully Interstellar will change that)

Quentin Tarantino - Inglorious Basterds

Nicolas Winding Refn - Drive(Maybe, just maybe, Only God Forgives)

Terrence Malick - The Tree of Life

The way I did this was by picking my favorite Directors and picking which movie shows all of their tricks and techniques they've developed coming together and being perfected.  




 I still have a lot to see but so far...

 There is a video I love but haven't been able to find. The video is of a guy in a fast food place saying something about fighting. He then puts on his motorcycle helmet and wraps one arm around his head, and flails the other arm. All of his friends then start laughing. It was also filmed on a phone. I have no idea what it was called and I cannot find it anywhere. Help? 




 I just wanna see Birdman. It's apparently not playing anywhere in or around the city. What's up with that?

We get The Guest which is a super small indie film, heck we get small indie films all the time, why wouldn't we get a star studded film that has gotten critical acclaim?

Is it the theater choosing not to show it or is it the film distributer not wanting to show it here?

Just thought it was super weird. Memphis theaters are always unpredictable when it comes to indie films, but I thought Birdman would surely be here. 

Anyone know of any place that is showing it that I'm just unaware of? I only checked Malco and Ayjay cinemas. Are there any other movie theaters in or around the city? 




 I think you're both right. Everyone should stop listening to/reading biased opinions and do their own damn research. This goes for everything. 




 In Mormonism they are taught everyone goes to Heaven. There is no Hell, just different tiers of Heaven.  




 This is misinformation, Mormons don't believe in a hell so there's nothing they can damn you to. 




 I glanced over the doc(I'll read more in depth latter) and most of that stuff I'm aware of and hasn't really affected me. I'm definitely aware of the LGBT issues due to my cousin being gay. I can't say I agree with their stance on that. I think that since I'm aware of most of this stuff it doesn't affect me. By that I mean I don't agree with most of it and I don't act out any of it. None of the stuff really directly affects me. Now if I was a woman, it'd be different because of how much it *would* directly affect me. 

Also, the last part bothered me. The part about only Mormons go to heaven and if you leave, you never see your family again. To the best of my understanding, that's entirely false. Everyone goes to heaven. There is no hell. The only thing is what level of heaven you go to. You will for sure see your family again even if you leave, because the family that stays will be able to visit you as often and as long as they want. You can travel to the lower tiers, you just can't travel to the upper tier(s) if you reside in the lower one(s). At least, according to the teachings.

Like I said, I'll continue to read more to inform my opinion better.

But I do want to thank you for the discussion. And I wish you the best as well. 




 The thing is though, is that I don't want to know if it's made up. In fact, I kind of just don't care if it's made up or true. If I leave, I'd rather it be because it's not right for me because of the way I live. I don't want to learn it's made up *because* my loved ones believe it. I wouldn't want to know it to be false and have my family believe it to be true at the same time. That would make things harder for me deal with. I've never been the kind of person to create friction. I wouldn't want *them* to start questioning it as well, because they're happy believing it. 

I've thought about my future constantly from both sides. How would it be if I wasn't Mormon? How would it be if I was? I can honestly see myself happy in both scenarios. But I can also see myself being unhappy in both as well. So I just take it day by day and have just decided to go with it. Let fate push and pull me where it must.

The way I see it, I'm happy with how I'm living now. I've found some weird equilibrium and for now, I'm okay with it. 

By the way, I wanted to ask you something. I was afraid to ask earlier because I was afraid you would think I was being snarky, but now that things are diffused, What's with your username? If you don't believe, then why that username? 




 I never once said that what was posted was anti Mormon. I also don't blindly follow this religion. I've seen a bunch of different perspectives. Heck, half my family isn't Mormon. If you were to watch me go through one day of my life you'd see that I'm not a good Mormon. I'm pretty much Mormon in name only. Yeah I don't do drugs or smoke or drink but that's just a personal thing that I've never been in to. But I do and support many things the church doesn't. You and I are not the same. You weren't in my shoes. I'm not saying your experience doesn't hold any value, but people have different lives. Things vary person to person. You said we were taught that questioning the church is a sin. I was never taught that. I was always told it was normal and it was up to us to do the research and figure out for ourselves if it was true or not. 

I'm always struggling with religion. Honestly maybe I don't care if it's true or not. Maybe I like believing there is a God. Believing in an afterlife and great plan for everyone. I stay Mormon not because I'm worried what other Mormons think, but because of my family. I mean they love and support me no matter what, even if I did leave, but there would still be disappointment. I also enjoy the community of the church. I go to the singles branch so no one there is pushy or preachy. They're all really cool and nice people that are around my age that are fun to talk to. 

I know you never said this, but I just wanted it to be clear that I'm not a hardcore devout Mormon blindly following a religion I know nothing about. I'm simply an impostor playing pretend because it's the easiest thing to do right now. Playing pretend until I can discover how I really feel on my own. I consider everything and rule nothing out. That's why I look at both sides. Yeah I may not do a lot of reading. I never said that was a good thing. I wasn't bragging about it. It's a flaw and I will have to read a lot to discover how I really feel. I realize everything I just said may seem hypocritical and might null everything I've said in previous comments, but that's the honest truth. 

I'm just a dude on the internet. 

 




 Well for one I never claimed to know the absolute truth. And I never said I was more right than a Jew or Catholic. I'm just a dude on the internet who likes movies and doesn't like reading. 

I also never claimed anything specific to be anti Mormon. Like you said, I probably never read the stuff you talked about. So it didn't really make since to me why you'd bring that stuff up when I never claimed anything specifically, and especially not the stuff you brought up, to be anti Mormon or hostile. It was all kind of irrelevant. You asking me what about all those publications is hostile is a weird question when I didn't say any of them were. You simply asked me to define "anti Mormon". So I did.  




 I guess people or things that aggressively oppose Mormons or Mormonism with hostility? I personally use it to describe things that are hostile and aggressively opposed to it. It's fine to oppose something, it's when it gets aggressive and hostile I'd start using the term "anti". Technically, you can totally be anti anything and not be aggressive which is perfectly fine. So long as no one is getting mentally, emotionally, or physically hurt. I didn't mean what was posted was anti Mormon (I didn't read it obviously) or you or anyone here specifically. I was just saying I read that stuff all the time. I mean you come across that stuff frequently on the internet often so you can't really avoid it. And I don't really try to avoid it for that matter. Like I said, I'll read anything, anti Mormon or not, as long as it's not too long. Or I find it interesting. So I guess I should correct myself, I hate reading unless it's something I truly find interesting or love, like film. I could read for hours about movies.  




 Well I mean 1) Your reply was one line. 2) it directly pertains to me because you're talking to me. So of course I did. I'd happily read anti Mormon stuff if it's like a paragraph at most. I don't have a problem reading things that question Mormonism so it's not an "ignorance is bliss" thing, it's a "I don't like reading so the longer it gets, the less likely I'll read it" thing.  




 Thanks, the way I've always viewed it, despite whatever I believe religiously, and whether I think it's true or not, I've always had a firm belief that church and religion should be separate from government and not influence laws and what not. 




 Naw not really. I just hate reading. That's a pretty popular feeling among the general public. I find it funny it's so hard for you to believe that I'm just a super lazy person who hates to read. Like I said before, if you ask me "why" I don't care to read it, I'll tell you why. 




 I'm sorry to hear that. My cousin is in the same situation and it's far from easy. In my comment that was a reply to your comment I was just trying to understand. I'll say you should definitely talk to your ex about it, which you might have done already because you're concerned about your daughter. But I don't know anything about your life so I'mma just shut up now. 




 Either your favorite current commercial that's recently been on tv, or just any one from your past that has stuck with you.  




 Never said I was temple worthy. I don't pay tithing. I'm not a good Mormon. I agree with you that it's not right to group the Mormons together as people because they're different person by person. That's been my problem with this thread. There's a bunch of people in here saying that Mormons are bad people and "love bombers" and malicious. I'm okay with people having problems with the church as a whole and certain individual Mormons, but when you start grouping them together and call me terrible because I'm Mormon that's when I get upset. I'm not like most Mormons because of my family. I have a gay cousin that I love and half my family isn't Mormon so I was raised to never judge people based on their religion but who they are as a person. 

I was downvoted earlier just because I told someone there are great people who happen to be Mormon and said that I was Mormon as well and just wanted everyone to be treated equally. Why? Who knows. I wasn't being dishonest, I was respectful and polite and non aggressive. 

My motto has always been "Live and let live. Don't worry about what other people are doing unless it directly affects you." 




 Eh, who cares what the church tells your daughter. You're her parent. You are the one who should be doing what's best for her. You say you don't like what they're teaching her, but if you aren't doing anything about it then you are part of the problem. Do something about it because like I said YOU ARE HER PARENT! You don't like what they're telling her? Don't let her go. The solution is there. If she's in primary then she is younger than 10, which makes me ask, if you don't like it, why take her? And if you aren't taking her, then who is? 




 No, I haven't. The reason is that I simply don't care to read it. If you ask me why I don't care or any other question, I'll definitely answer your question. But that's the simple answer: I just don't care. I'm not saying that to be a blind follower, I say that because I mean I don't care enough to read that much. I've just never been a reader in my life so when I saw how many pages I groaned, but I did read the first 8 pages. But like I said, if you ask me why I don't care or any other question, I'll answer it without a doubt. It just won't be in a timely manner because reddit won't let me do anything because of how many of my comments have been downvoted lately, but I'll answer! 




 I haven't thrown any money to Prop 8 or anything.  




 You know how people hate it when a religious person tries to push their religion and beliefs onto them? That's what this thread kind of feels like, but with the roles reversed. 

Now the non religious people are pushing their disbelief onto others.

It's all the same. We're all just as terrible. 




 This will sound stupid, but religion isn't about believing with your brain, but with your heart. Religion isn't about finding out if it's factually accurate, it's about faith. And it is up to the individual to choose to have faith or not. See, I always thought the people who call Joseph Smith a con man and call Mormonism a hoax are just as bad as the religious people who push their religion on others. It's the same thing, but instead of pushing their beliefs, they're pushing their disbelief onto others. People should just live and let live. Someone believes in something you don't? Who cares. You think it makes them an idiot? Who cares. I'm sure we all have more important things to deal with than worry about what someone else believes in. I'm not talking bout you specifically, relevantlife, I'm talking people in general including me.

I find myself constantly struggling with my beliefs, but in my experience, yeah I've seen people have a bad experience with Mormons and the religion, but I've also seen people's lives change for the better as well. Just like any religion or belief or whatever. But what do I really know? I'm just a person.

We are all just people. We can't prove (a)God exists and we can't prove (a)God doesn't exist, so that means we are all just arguing about who's hypothesis is better, which is why religious debates are so dumb. 




 If it means anything, there are some great Mormon people out there. I'm Mormon and just want everyone to be happy and treated equally with the same rights. I support a *lot* of stuff the church as a whole doesn't.

Edit: Kinda sucks that I'm being downvoted just for saying that I support equal rights and happen to be Mormon. 




 Don't you *ever* try to tell me how to live my life again. 




 This makes me think of how great the use of CGI is in Fincher's films. His CGI is never really in your face and is mostly subtle, which is why it's so great. If you watch his VFX breakdowns on his movies, you'd be surprised at what's CGI! 




 First I want to say I'm relatively new to DSLR filming. So I've been noticing a lot of noise when I do low light shooting. I believe I'm doing a good job at lighting dark scenes and having the right camera settings, but even still, I'm noticing lots of noise. Even when I use lenses that are great in low light situations. Are t3i's typically bad at low light situations and generally produce a lot of noise?

What are some good ways to prevent, battle, or fix noisy footage? And should I just invest in a better camera? 




 I'm late replying, but since no one else said it, if you super jump off of an edge you won't receive any fall damage. I super jump off of skyscrapers all the time and it feels awesome!  




 I was just saying that the piano scene was just a good scene in general, not specifically the cinematography, although I do think Spring Breakers is a beautifully shot film despite the quality of the film itself, which I like. And I do agree that Prisoners was beautifully shot. You might like [this](http://mattscottvisuals.com/blog/2014/1/10/-what-are-you-looking-at-disecting-the-work-of-a-master). It's a breakdown and examination of Prisoner's cinematography. 




 That piano scene though 




 Thanks! I sent you a PM 




 I was wondering when you'd show up! 




 Hey thanks for the reply! I sent you a FB message 




 It's Saturday at 10 am. Like I said, super short notice 




 As it says in the title, I have a short film scheduled to shoot on Saturday and my actor bailed. The equipment is already rented and props are bought. I could really use a miracle here. I don't even care if you're an actor or not. If you believe you can act and can appear menacing, please give it a shot.

If you volunteer please know it's unpaid(I'm broke) and it *is* a main role so one other shooting day will be in the future(October 25th). After that you're done. 

The role calls for a male actor. Age unspecified as well as race. The only thing is you have to look like someone in their late 20s or early 30s. Also, I can provide footage of the day 1 shoot to show we know what we're doing and this won't be a terrible home movie.

I'm in a terrible situation here and this is my last ditch attempt to save this project that has already been started and has had the heart, soul, blood, sweat, and tears of other people poured into it. Help? 




 Isn't she blind? 




 Preferably practical effects and make up and not cgi? Like videos that show ow they did something? 




 I'd like to consider myself a non-alcoholic drink connoisseur. I like trying new, different, unique drinks! Then I collect the bottles/cans!

 Like an actor/actress who was in some financially or critically successful movie and you thought to yourself, "They're going places!", but then their career sort of just fizzled out. 




 I didn't get into GTAIV until Gay Tony and the Lost DLC had already come out so I don't know how R* goes about releasing DLC info. I just thought it was kinda strange we hadn't heard a thing on any story DLC. Maybe I missed the news? Is this how R* usually is? When do they usually start releasing details for their story DLC? Just curious 




 Anyone have a mirror? Says the webpage is unavailable :( 




 I'm not saying dark is better. I just mean I appreciated Disney taking a risk and being ballsy with the Lone Ranger. The dude cuts out and eats another dudes heart. I do agree that there were bad tone shifts where it goes from dark drama to comedy adventure.  




 That navy ship segment in 3 Ninjas is really cool. As well as the paper mill segment in 3 Ninjas Knuckle Up  




 I also kind of appreciated how dark they went with the movie considering it's a Disney movie. 









 I feel lie this doesn't solve it because now, instead of waiting to see if one movie has a great ending, you're waiting to see if three movies have great endings.

You're still asking people to post a great ending movie, the only difference is that they are posting two other movies as well. You'll still be looking forward to the great ending, which is what you wanted to avoid. Only now you'll be disappointed two thirds of the time.  




 Jesus of Suburbia is still one of my all time favorite songs. 









 It's not though...it's a prop cigarette. It's the *exact* one I linked. I've used them tons of times in theater and shorts.  




 Fun Fact: The e-cig is actually a movie prop! It's a plastic cigarette and you screw in butt, and when you inhale, the end lights up. It's mostly for actors who do not smoke and wish to keep it that way. It's all just vapor!

 Without spoiling, is it bad? 




 Edge of Tomorrow - A Most Wanted Man - The Drop - Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

I have not seen these movies yet but I *do* want to see them. Because of where I live and how long two of them have been out, when Friday hits none of them will be playing here anymore. I want to catch them before they leave the theater.

I'm working and going to school this week so tomorrow/today(Tuesday) is my only free day. And because of the showtimes, I only have time to see three of them. This put me in a position to make a hard choice!

Which of the four, without spoiling things, can I eliminate and wait to see on Redbox or something? Which three are the must see ones? I realize this all depends on my personal taste, but what do you guys have to say?  




 Which was an outrage. Oklahoma chick did ventriloquism while singing. New York drummed on a solo cup.

Edit: Ohio not Oklahoma 




 Naw ventriloquist girl should've won 




 Not that I'm complaining. But I was just thinking about how many films today have synthy, 80s inspired scores and looks to them. 

What movie started this? There was a time in 90s and early to late 2000s where most movie had typical cinematic scores and looks. But something changed and we started getting more and more films that have had their look and music inspired by the 80s. 




 You didn't mention it, but I wanted to say that GTA5 Online is pretty much zero fun unless you're playing with friends. 

Another thing: I feel like most multiplayer games aren't fun by yourself now a days because everyone is in a party or private chat with friends so it's super quiet if you're playing alone 




 Really surprised to see Apocalypto on here. Love that movie and it's not one that's brought up often when talking about great films. 




 What parts did they get right/wrong? 




 The Matrix blew my mind when I saw it.  




 See I never understood this. It's like saying, "I wish I wasn't rich because all this money is weighing me down."

I had extremely bad acne when I was a teenager. Luckily it's cleared up, but the acne scars severely hindered my ability to grow facial hair. Couldn't grow a beard if I tried. Should consider yourself lucky that you at least have the option to grow your beard out or not. You don't *have* to shave because the worst thing that'll happen is you get a nice beard. I have to shave because if I don't, I get this really ugly, messy patchy "beard".  




 Just bought a suit and was wondering if any of you guys have found a good tailor who isn't crazy expensive

Not the best movie but I regularly use this quote.  




 300 has my favorite shot from a film. This could be spoilers but near the end when Leonidas throws his spear there is a shot of the spear reflecting off of some gold stairs. You don't see the spear, you just see it's reflection as it travels over the steps. Beautiful shot! 




 Hey! I thought this post would've been dead by now! Glad you found it! I can't do anything this week due to a project, but next week, all week, I should be free.  




 Different game but you should check out Just Cause 2. That's the thing I loved most about that game. Three islands: one was all jungle and snowy mountains, one all desert, and one all city.  




 For real. I remember when the gtav trailer came out and it showed some hikers in the woods, that forest looked so dense.  




 A crime/drama about two criminals who escape the police by killing and stealing the identities of two hikers. 




 Really? Where at? 




 I might be willing to check it out
 




 Yeah this expansion has taken out everything I liked about Saints Row. It's not about gangs or crimes, it's not even semi-realistic or believable, and now they took out customization. Man, I can't wait for saints row 5.  




 No that's what I want though. Not specifically dead kids, but that feeling you get when you're looking at something sexy then, the next thing you know, you just watched someone die. 









 I'm working on an editing project in Final Cut Pro and it is insanely important that I get Motion 4. It is imperative to my project. I can't find Motion 4 anywhere! Does it even exist anymore? Did it vanish? Is there any way to get it?!

I would use Motion 5 but it removed vital features I need for this project. Features that 4 *did* have. Help!

 Recently I've been really into the opening scene from The Player. It's like an 8 minute long shot that's really complex because in this 8 minute shot it perfectly sets up every side story in the movie. Great shot and great opening.  




 Alright I sent you a message!  




 Or just any cool empty industrial sites? Looking to do some urban photography. Would be cool if the had some "nature taking it back" look to them but not necessary.  Really just any abandoned or dilapidated urban environments.  




 You don't have to convince me. I've got my button and everything. Wolfskull won me over with his confidence and charisma.  




 Yeah I always felt the spirit of this subreddit was a "so crazy it just might work" sort of thing. But a lot of these posts as of late are just things that don't make any sense at all. The Wolfskull thread was awesome and refreshing but now everyone is so blatantly trying to copy it.  




 What was it about Matthew McConaughey that changed? It's no secret that lately McConaughey has turned into one of Hollywood's "go to" guy as of late. He has turned his career around and went from being a joke to being one of the most talented actors working today. 

My question is, what was it that changed? Did McConaughey actually become a better actor, or did he just start choosing better movies?

I was watching Sahara, the adventure movie from 2005, and noticed that McConaughey himself hadn't really changed. It felt like the same Matthew that we are getting today. He still acted the same, yet I still felt like I was watching a not good McConaughey performance. I didn't *think* he gave a bad performance but it *felt* like a bad one, if that makes sense? 

So when did this change in McConaughey happen? And was the change with himself and how he acted in projects, or was it simply he started picking better projects? 




 Do you know where Memphis is? It's quite literally on the border of both Arkansas and Mississippi. Crossing either one of those state lines would take me about 15-20 minutes at most from where I live. It's not like I'm driving across a state. I've done it before to see movies that weren't playing in my city. 

Also, why are you even here if you're opposed to the idea of this subreddit? 




 Really not seeing the problem here. It's not like people will go over to each other's houses. People would be meeting at a theater which is a public place that is most likely to have a large crowd. Especially on a weekend. They'd also be driving separate cars. Honestly, this is no different from a simple reddit meetup. People do it all the time. I make short films and have used reddit to find and meet with local actors and crew members. This honestly is not rapey at all.  




 That's not very nice :( 




 Being an adult. 




 Man SF is fantastic. Too bad it's expensive to live there or I totally would move there. Working on saving up and building my resume. Maybe I'll make it over there. I wish your brother good luck on his endeavors. Maybe one day we'll meet and work together.  




 That I'll waste away my life doing nothing fulfilling or anything that makes me happy and I'll end up all alone and sad.

I want to get married. I want a family. I want a career I'll enjoy. Not getting these things scare me to death. 




 I'm cool.

My co workers and friends thin I am. 

I know I'm not.

I have to keep them believing though.

Anything to get them out of my store really. 




 If they could never move out I'd choose Ryan Gossling so I could pitch him all my movie ideas and he could never leave.

 What is this from? 




 When I was in high school some buddies and I went to shoot a video for our film class. We needed shots of planes taking off. So we thought it would be a good idea to go to our international airport and film planes taking off while we were on a dirt road that went between the runways. I was also wearing a ghillie suit. 

The next thing we knew three suv's with fully tactical cops came driving up. They made us erase all of our footage. We explained to them what we were doing. We found out they were pretty cool and joked around with us, and even told us where we could go to get permission to film planes. Then they let us go.

That situation could have gone so bad but lucky for us we were dealing with some cool cops. 




 My hot neighbor sunbathing by the pool.

Nah, just kidding. It's almost always a spider in a web. 




 Nothing? 




 If only it were that easy. We live in a world where things keep getting more expensive and jobs that pay well are getting hard to find. Moving is never easy. Especially to a new city where you don't know anyone.

Trust me, the "Get the Fuck Outta Here" savings account exists, but it's only slowly growing. 




 Yeah, there we go! There was, I think, a tv movie about it, but if I remember correctly, it wasn't good. 




 Something that could be used and applied to almost any situation.

 Seriously thought about it once. I wanted to just backpack across the country or something. Maybe move to a new place and start over.

 I convinced my friends fiance that I seriously thought I was immortal. We spent an hour talking about it. It was an Oscar worthy performance. I shed some tears and stuff. I don't think she believed that I was actually immortal, but I new she thought I was completely insane and needed help. 

Still haven't told her the truth.

Anyways, David Fincher needs to get on this ASAP 




 Interviewing myself. I like walking around the house or neighborhood asking myself questions as if an interviewer was talking to me like I was a famous person for doing something. Usually making or staring in a movie. I play both parts and ask myself what the filmmaking process was like and what obstacles I faced while making the movie. As someone who actually *does* make movies, it often helps me work out problems I might be having with production.

But yeah, I know other people talk to themselves, but I don't think they assume roles and play all the parts. 




 PS4. Bought one at launch. Definitely did not need it right then and could have waited a year. But I don't regret it because I enjoy using Netflix on it.

 Sorry, totally slipped my mind. I'm using a canon rebel t3i. 

My budget is like $200. Renting of course.  




 I don't know the quality of these items, so I'm looking for advice on if it's a smart buy.

 I'm looking specifically for a wide angle lens. I want to get some nice wide shots. I also need one that will not produce a lot of grain in the dark. Something that has great image quality in light and dark.

I'd be renting from [lensrentals](http://www.lensrentals.com/rent/canon/lenses/wide-angle) so from the options they have, which would be best? Which ones would be most versatile? 




 So is he implying that it will be like a 4 player co-op? 




 The Death Book-Ended one is interesting. How'd you come up with that? 




 It's a crime story about death.

 I'm writing a short. Need someone to give me a title.  




 Oh yeah I've seen it. But it's been a while. I actually bought it on dvd a long time ago. It was also I think the first movie I ever blind bought. Couldn't find it anywhere then I just ordered the dvd. It's been one of my favorites since.  
























 I haven't seen the playthrough so this is a serious question: could it be possible the person playing just didn't use the systems? I've played plenty of games where I didn't use some of the systems.  




 I think that's why people like it. You can tell everyone is having so much fun acting so dumb. 




 Hmm, sometimes I'll just say black because that's what color they mostly are, but mostly I'll just say they're black with some orange mixed in. 




 This was a nightmare to put together! I've never had so much trouble putting furniture together. Those pegs. Those damn pegs!

Does look great though. 




 Where did that Saving Private Ryan come from? It looks great! 









 Except for, you know, misquoting it. 









 I'm going to throw Robert Pattinson out there. I think he's shown he has acting chops, looks young, right body type, and can do an American accent. Don't know about wittiness though. He does seem fun in interviews.

And if it weren't for Xmen, I'd say Nicholas Hoult.

But if we're talking about more realistic choices, I agree with those saying Logan Lerman. 




 all of them 




 It was interesting at first, but after hearing/seeing it every time they perform with little variation it feels stale. I think it's good, but boring.

I kind of can't wait to get huge performer Lady Gaga back. 




 Seriously? I find that super interesting considering how many number one hits she's had. 




 I don't know, I think back to when Buried came out and people were wondering how a movie about a guy in a box could be good and it ended up being solid. Granted it has different circumstances than what I'm doing. But I think it'll all be in the execution. 

I do appreciate all of your input though. It's given me a lot to think about.  




 Well in a situation where you are severely injured and in the middle of the woods, I think it would definitely take priority over other things.  




 There wouldn't be any "same as they were before the accident" because it starts immediately after the accident. We don't see the person before the accident. 

They wouldn't be running around. They are severely injured so it's them getting from point A to point B. That's why I'm wondering if a story can still be good if the character doesn't develop.  




 Well the accident that stranded her also killed a loved one, but honestly, beyond wanting to survive and live, there is nothing she wants. 




 In the context of the story, all they want is to live.  




 Essentially it is sort of a bare bones survival story of a person stranded in the woods for a few days. They are injured and can't do much physically. I'm trying to figure out how to develop the character when they are the only character. 

I'm also wondering if a story can be good without character development.  




 They are stranded after an accident. The physical condition they are in would not allow them to hunt. They are also there for only a few days. 

I like the example of dreaming at night. But even in a dream, I'd run into the same problem of trying to deliver exposition and character development with only one character.  




 Yes they are trying to survive after an accident. It has a cold opening that starts immediately after the accident. But it's not like Cast Away where they are stranded for months. They are only stranded for a few days so going crazy doesn't seem likely.  




 I'm writing, or at least trying to, a story that takes place entirely in the woods and with only one character. How would you go about developing the character, defining who they are, and showing an arc?

Internal monologue wouldn't fit with the story and talking out loud seems clunky. Can I make it work?

Does a character need to be developed or have an arc for the story to be good?

Help? 




 You might want to delete that and pm it to me for your own privacy 




 I'll just email it to you using Google drive and it should give you an option to download it.  




 I can send it to you in a Google drive. Would that work? 




 I'd love if you gave it a shot!  




 This is it! 




 I'm incredibly flexible! Two weeks would be great! But like I said, I'm flexible! 




 I guess something more low key. Something modern, moody, and slow. While editing the short, I was listening to a lot of drone and ambient music. 




 More symphonic  




 It's all narrated  




 Good idea! The full thing isn't posted anywhere due to it not having any music, but I did post a [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yB-FYkQr-_4) the other day! It'll hopefully give an idea of tone. 




 I recently just finished editing a short film I spent 7 months on. I'd love to have it be a 100 percent original film, so I'm looking for someone who'd be interested in scoring it.

I'm going to just put it out there so I don't waste anyone's time: I don't have money. This has been a passion project of mine that some friends were kind enough to help me with. I'm not saying that I expect someone to score it for free, but if I did pay someone, it wouldn't be a lot purely because I just *don't* have a lot.

Now that that's out there, let me tell you about the film. It's a small scale crime story about a cop bringing down two criminals. It's heavily inspired by classic film noir, but takes place in the modern day setting. It also takes a somewhat existential look at death.

I really could see some drone/ambient music fitting it well. But I'm not experienced in music, so I'm open to anything really.

I've done music for my own shorts before, but they're never good, so I'd love to have someone who actually knows something about music do the score.

If this isn't a good place for this post, could someone point me in the direction of a more proper subreddit?

Thank you so much! 




 I don't know if this is it. I distinctly remember Brad trying to read the name of the person the next email was from and being interrupted every time until he finally just yelled. 




 So while going through some bombcast videos, I was reminded of a fairly recent podcast episode where during the emails section, Brad read an email that led to a rather gross/disturbing discussion. The crew kept talking about it despite Brad trying to change the subject by going to the next email. Every time he tried to transition to the next email, the guys would interrupt him and continue the conversation.

Anyone know what I'm talking about?  




 As someone who's studied forensics, any time someone is hurt/killed and there's blood/gore, I automatically get super critical of the realism. I hate myself for it because it will sometimes ruin movies for me.  




 You should check out The One I Love. It's a great comedy/drama with a strange scifi twist. Feels very much like it could be an episode of The Twilight Zone.  




 As a guy in the singles ward who *didn't* go on a mission, this suuuucks. RMs taking all the women.  









 Great! Thanks for contributing and helping this sub get started! 




 [Just did it!](http://www.reddit.com/r/FirstTitleThenStory/comments/2u5n9h/lock_void/) 









 Hello, I made a subreddit that I feel could be the sister subreddit of this place.

/r/FirstTitleThenStory is another kind of writing prompt subreddit I made where instead of a traditional prompt, the prompt is just a title. Nothing else. No other information. I thought it'd be an interesting experiment.

Is this something anyone would like? 




 Hey everyone! This is a subreddit where someone submits a "title" and people will reply with a story based off of that title! The idea behind this is to allow users to get even more creative!

Think of it as a writing prompt, but instead of a synopsis, all you have to go off of is a title. No genre, no style, no nothing.

Let me know if you have any questions or ways to improve this place!

Hopefully this will be a fun thing that will survive!

Edit: I'll post a title a day until the sub grows a bit. Hopefully it will! 




 You should see Take This Waltz. He does a good job playing a normal husband in that.  




 I guess for me it's the number of films I have with alternate box art designs. 




 I think for me the reason I tend to get a steelbook over a normal one is because I see movies as works of art, so I think the cover art should reflect that. I don't just want my collection to be good. I want it to *look* good as well. I personally think most movies have terrible or generic cover art so that it's easier for them to sell, which is understandable. They have to make money.  I also think the blue cases throw off some good cover art.

Most steelbooks I come across have more interesting artwork and can get away with being more abstract so that's what's appealing about them to me. But if the steelbook art looks the same as the regular art, then I'll just go with the regular one since it'll be cheaper usually. And in some cases, the steelbook will have worse art. Like [these](http://i0.wp.com/www.pissedoffgeek.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/breaking-bad-steadman.jpg?resize=752%2C619) Breaking Bad ones. Sure, they're interesting, but I jus think they don't look good.

But that's the thing, it's all just preference. 

I'd have to say for me personally, it's steelslipcoverregular blu

But you're not idiotic for not liking steels. It's just a preference, man! 




 Why? 




 I think "not big on it" and "atheism" are two different things.  




 I'm looking at getting a new laptop. It's preowned and has FCP9 on it already. I'm used to and comfortable with FCP7. How much trouble will I have adjusting? Is FCP9 bad?

Edit: Shows how much me and the guy selling the laptop knows. Didn't know FCP 9 wasn't a thing.  




 I'm looking at a new laptop that is preowned. I'm used to and comfortable editing with FCP7. The laptop has FCP9 on it. How different is 9 from 7. Will I have trouble adjusting? 




 This is where dreams come true. Good luck everyone! 




 Looks like Eddie Vedder  




 It's interesting you bring up 2001 because the man who did the visual effects for 2001 also did the visual effects for the creation of the universe scenes in Tree of Life. 




 I saw it when it came out a couple of years ago. I declare it a masterpiece. 




 Warriors of Virtue is the sickest 




 Well, I mean, 1999 was like 15 years ago and 1990 was like 25 years ago. A lot has changed in cinema since then. A lot of advancements in technique and technology. It's perfectly reasonable to assume most movies of the 90s haven't stood the test of time. If you're someone who was born in the 70s, then the 90s probably don't feel old. But if you're someone who was born in the late 90s, that was an entire lifetime ago.

I don't consider the 90s "old" but it *was* over a decade ago. Heck, 1990 was a quarter of a century ago! It sounds old when you say it like that! 




 Yep. As a big guy who can't grow a beard there's no hope for me :( 




 But purple rain 




 I made a short film and I wanted to give a gift to the people who helped me make it. A physical copy of the film. I know absolutely zero about photoshop so I was looking for someone who is creative and artistic to create the cover art for the Bluray case. I can be contacted through PM. 




 I mean, to be fair, the no chemistry thing works because she doesn't want Bruce Wayne anymore.  




 I think the core concept and story of the first Saw is incredible. However I just think the execution missed the mark a little. I still love it and think it's a great movie though.  




 The thing is though, while Middle East would be really cool, I just think there wouldn't be enough variety in animal life.

And the reason I said Galapagos is because I think there's good variety in the geography and some interesting animal life. But yeah, you're totally right in that it'd feel too similar to 3.

Another cool one would be the Alaskan wilderness, or heck, let's just go to Antarctica! 




 Something like a fake So Paulo would be cool. Have some wilderness but also some favelas on steep hills. 

Maybe something Middle East inspired with dessert environments and canyons. 

Also since Far Cry 4 didn't have enough of it, it'd be cool to have one that mostly took place in the mountains. 

Galpagos Islands would be pretty sick! 




 As someone who just watched Saw yesterday, most of that movie is like a 6/10. But those last 20 minutes, when you see everything come together and play out, it's like a 10/10. 




 I enjoy a song that has a nice build up to a big release. What are some of your favorite crescendo songs? 




 Quite literally  




 We always hear the villain say something along the lines of "You and I are a lot alike." And the hero will say "I'm nothing like you."

Are there any instances where the villain and the hero are indeed just alike? 




 Essentially making the movie from the perspective of the antagonist.  




 I'm writing something and was wondering if you guys knew of any movies that tell a beautiful love story between two gay people. 

I feel like most movies portray gay people in an unrealistic way. I'm looking for movies that portray gay people in a realistic and beautiful way? Brokeback Mountain would be an obvious one, but what are some romance movies about two gay people? 




 People who say Requiem for a Dream is the most depressing and traumatizing movie have not seen Martyrs. 




 You could really say the same thing about any Marvel movie though. People can say what they want about Avatar's story, but it created an incredible and original world and universe. It's so incredibly detailed and well realized. More so than any movie had in a long long time, and more than any movie since.  




 I love Terrence Malick films but the problem is that he's only made a few and I've seen them all multiple times. 

What are some films that feel very inspired by his films? Not just in their themes but also in how they are shot and edited and how he does storytelling.  




 Avatar is still the most jaw dropping theater experience I've ever had. I'd give anything to see it in 3d imax again.  




 I dunno. I was thinking about it, and I'm not entirely sure it fits what I'm looking for. The thing about LNS, and I won't spoil anything, is that, while there *is* a character that isn't who they say they are, it doesn't really play on this. LNS doesn't really show you-know-who's character as a mysterious one, they just use flat out misdirection, which I don't think is the same thing.

The thing about the movies I used as examples, The Guest and Stoker, is that they don't misdirect you into believing the character's are something opposite of what they really are. Instead, they leave their backstories vague and almost breadcrumb-like hints about the true nature of their characters. In fact, right from the get go you feel something is off about the characters.

LNS, on the other hand, leaves you no hints to who the character really is, and I personally never felt like something was of about LNS's character. They don't ever give you a reason to not believe the character is who they say they are.

Now don't get me wrong, I think LNS is a fantastic movie and I love it. I also haven't seen it in a while, so I could be super wrong in all of this and might be overlooking some things that I have forgotten about it. However, I don't remember getting a "this person isn't who they say they are" vibe from LNS. 




 Yes, I've seen it and this definitely fits what I'm looking for! 




 I just watched The Guest and I really enjoyed the first half of it because it plays as a mystery. You're wondering who this guy *really* is, and you get a sense that the character is not who they say they are, and their background is kind of unclear whether it's true or not.

Another film I can thin of that kind of follows this is Stoker. In Stoker, you're not really sure who Matthew Goode's character *really* is, but there's something mysterious and off about him.

An interesting thing to note is that in both of these films, the mysterious character is a very charming and charismatic guy.

Are there any other movies that play around with the idea of someone not being who they say they are? Or where a character's true identity or back story is a mystery? 

I'd like to see more movies where there is a character who is mysterious, kind of off, and gives off an "I'm not who you think I am" kind of vibe.

Edit: I thought maybe it'd help if I clarify that I'm not looking for movies that just simply have a character that's not who you think they are, but movies that have a character that's not who you think they are and *the movie plays on this idea*. If that makes sense. 









 The Exterminating Angel has held up very well in my opinion.  




 Storyboarding will save you time and are so efficient. The best part is that you don't have to be a good artist. Since you are directing and operating the camera, you are really the only person who needs to be able to discern them.

Storyboarding will make shooting so much easier and organized. It's so nice to go into a shoot knowing exactly what shots you need. Too many times I've gone into shoots without a storyboard planning to just improvise and I end up wasting a lot of time standing around trying to figure out shots. You save so much time when you storyboard because when you're done with one shot, you just refer to your board and can immediately know where and how to set up your camera. 




 I'm gonna buy a house! 









 In this scene a man is standing in the wilderness at night. How do you light a scene like this on a micro budget? What's the best way to shoot it?

Also, a side question, what's the best way to capture a starry night on video?

I'll be using a Canon Rebel T3i, but I might rent a camera instead. 




 It's just a man asking people where someone is but the way it's shot makes you feel so uneasy. The camera is sideways throughout most of the sequence which leaves little room in the frame.  




 I'm super late to the party so no one will see this.

Inside. It's a French horror film. Very disturbing, but more so in terms of gore. It's definitely going for shock value in it's violence. Basically it's about a woman who breaks into another woman's house to steal her unborn baby. 




 Why? I haven't seen it in a long time and the only disturbing thing I remember from it is the dream sequence and even that wasn't *that* disturbing. 




 I love the hellish mood of it. It felt a lot like watching a nightmare. 




 Even if you end up not liking it, I think it's still a worthwhile experience because there is not another movie out there like it. Highly original and visually stunning. 




 Yeah, the nightclub scene, not just the fire extinguisher part, but the entire sequence, made me feel severely uncomfortable and claustrophobic as well as making me feel anxiety. 




 I feel like I'm missing something. I don't find the babadook to be a great horror film. I do think it is a great film all around, but it feels more like a psychological thriller mixed with a family drama.  




 I find it interesting that you'd hesitate to call The Cabin in the Woods a horror, whereas I'd hesitate to call the Babadook a horror.  




 The ending of the Matrix when Rage Against the Machine's "Wake Up" kicks in gets me so pumped.  




 Ditto 




 I do agree but I'm not great at articulating. Never have been. I worded it to the best of my abilities.  




 Like when a Wikipedia page is so interesting that it leads you to more and more links and Wikipedia pages 




 This sub is meant to be a bridge between /r/movies and /r/truefilm. I think my post, while not great, does fit here. I don't know if you were the one that downvoted my reply to you or not, but I feel it was unjustified. You asked me to be a bit more descriptive and I told you that I wasn't great at articulating and gave you two reasons why I didn't find it great. 

Then in reply you basically told me my post was bad and didn't belong here. I don't blame you for expecting higher quality posts, but that attitude is kind of why people are intimidated by /r/truefilm, and is why this sub was created. To be a more formal /r/movies and a more casual /r/truefilm.  




 I wouldn't say it's more /r/movies tier than most post on here. I posted this to get more of an understanding of what others thought of Goodfellas. 

It is entirely possible that Goodfellas was overhyped for me, and, in turn, I set myself up for disappointment. It's kind of hard for me to explain why it rubbed me the wrong way. I've never been great at articulating. I never said Goodfellas was bad. I do think it's a good movie. Above average and better than most movies. I just think that when compared to Scorsese's other work, Goodfellas hardly stands up. I know this isn't a great answer and not what you wanted to hear. 

Someone else said it earlier in this thread. They said that since I have seen Scorsese's recent work before I saw Goodfellas, it probably didn't seem like anything new or special. However, had I seen it when it came out, it would've been very fresh and interesting. I think this is entirely possible.  




 Great response! I also thought Wolf of Wall Street was disappointing. It felt like a parody of Scorsese films directed by Scorsese himself. It felt like one of the most self indulgent movies I've seen.  




 Scott has definitely made some great movies, but recently he's been like 85 percent bad and 15 percent good. Actually for last decade he's been like that. 




 I kind of just found it to be underwhelming. I didn't find it to be great like everyone keeps saying it is. Is it a good movie? Sure, but I don't think it's great and definitely don't think it's Scorsese's best.

Am I missing something? Is it actually an overhyped film? Can we talk about what it is about Goodfellas that sets it apart and makes it better than any of Scorsese's work? 




 I feel so weird because I think The Master is one of his worst. 




 I tend to enjoy them. It's interesting, movies are supposed to be a way of escapism. That's why I go see blockbusters. But there have been so many big budget movies in the last year or so, that I look forward to these small, hyper-realistic films. They're a nice break from all the blockbusters. An escape from escapism movies, if you will. 




  #sprangbreeeeaaaak 




 Triple Nine sounds great. Great cast and great director.

Everest is a great story with a great cast, but I'm worried about the director. Contraband and 2 Guns weren't great and this is the kind of story that needs a director that will do it justice. Although he did make an Oscar nominated film so there is still hope.

Is the Jungle Book going to be animated or live action? And will it be 3D or 2D animation? Do we know?

I had no idea the Coen brothers were writing a film for Steven Spielberg. That sounds pretty great.

The Martian is such a good book and I'm excited to see it, but I'm extremely worried since Ridley Scott is directing.

Never heard of The Revenant, but consider me excited. Interesting story and I love Alejandro Gonzlez Irritu.

Thanks for posting this, OP. I hadn't heard of some of these before so now I have new movies to look forward to! 




 Eh. I won't say it looks great, but Mann hasn't made a movie yet that I didn't at least enjoy, so I'll hold on to hope. 




 It's not, the article stated that the director is a first time director with Abrams producing.

Also, would Microsoft even allow Sony to produce a Halo movie? 









 Alternatively, what job/career is not as great as most people think it is? 




 That girl getting bullied was stone cold! She handled it so well. Those girls were trying to be intimidating and it was so satisfying watching her not buy into that empty intimidation. 




 I've never really had luck with finding steelbooks on Ebay. Almost everyone selling one thinks that their copy is so rare so they will list it for twice as much as you could get it from Zavvi. I just got a bunch of steelbooks on Zavvi. They were all in stock on zavvi, but when I checked Ebay, they were all more expensive there. 




 Yeah when it came out, but once it had been out for a couple of months people just sort of stopped talking about it. 




 So I don't now if it's actually not as good as I thought it was(I loved it), but I find it kind of strange that hardly anyone is talking about this movie. 




 Well, I mean, technically you can. It's called an identity rhyme. 




 I think Universal actually has plans to do more of these. 




 We asked my sister to take them and we picked out a couple that we liked. My sister told us that she didn't have any photo editing software and we don't know anyone who does.

We'd be happy to compensate for the work! Just enhancing and adjusting colors and lighting and touching them up to make them look really nice. We know nothing about photo editing! We'd appreciate any help!

I'm not super sure how this works, but if you PM me with some sort of estimate of the cost, that'd be great!

 Are they reliable? Are they legit? 




 I love slapstick and physical comedy. What are some comedies that are filled with this kind of humor? 




 That doesn't make it okay to have a shallow story or characters. 




 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXhpePGZdPM list=UUrTNhL_yO3tPTdQ5XgmmWjA#t=617 




 Gravity had a shallow story with shallow characters. It lacked depth. Not saying that Interstellar was any better. I think both are equally bad when it comes to writing. 




 Right, because it totally didn't spell everything out and left stuff to the imagination. 

Was Gravity a visual masterpiece? Hell yeah. Was Gravity the definition of a visual story? Hell no. 

What little Gravity had to say about it's characters or story, it said through dialogue.  




 I agree. Yeah, they both take place in space, but Interstellar is a high concept sci-fi, whereas Gravity is more like a "can happen today" kind of story. Someone said Gravity wasn't science fiction, but was more like science non-fiction, and I think that's fitting. 




 I think there is nothing wrong with having a bare-bones, straight forward story, but Gravity's story, to me, felt more shallow than anything else. 




  Interstellar was more like Nolan flatly telling the audience the story in dialogue and skipping over all the working underneath.

Wait, so you're telling me it's bad that Interstellar did this, but it's okay that Gravity did it? 




 Interstellar didn't have the best writing, but there's no way Gravity's writing was any better.  




 I vote Logan Lerman as Danny 




 Can you think of movies like Whiplash? Where the main character has an idol or someone they look up to, then the person becomes the character's mentor and then the character finds out their idol isn't who they thought they were?  




 Thanks? 




 I was just trying to be humorous 




 What does that even mean? 




 I don't know. I added a question mark because it was supposed to be read like I was unsure. You know, like with the inflection of my voice getting higher as the sentence went on while raising my shoulders.  




 I was always under the impression that it was considered a classic? 




 I've always seen the Dark Knight as more of a crime movie than a super hero movie. Even though it's a Batman movie, it felt hyper realistic by super hero movie standards. Not that that's a bad thing.  




 So there is a local tv station that has an entry level production assistant job opening. The guy said to send in my resume as well as some of my sample work from when I did tv production before.

My question is, how do I attach samples of work I've done to my resume?  




 It's not quite a movie, though. It was from the 90s. It was a video where your face would be on the cartoon main character's body. You might have been riding a bull at some point? I don't know how it worked. I got it as a Christmas gift from my grandmother when I was like 6.

Any ideas? 









 Was just wondering how my radio knows what song is playing on a given station 




 I agree that Fincher's visual style would fit well. I don't know why what I said pissed a couple of people off, but I think Anderson is great at creating a tense atmosphere. Look at There Will Be Blood, it's not at all a scary movie, but it definitely felt unnerving and tense the whole time. Now imagine if he was actually trying to scare you. 

David Fincher is easily my favorite director working today, but I always thought his style was better suited for real world movies. Movies that are more grounded in reality. Which the same could be said for PTA, but I can see them both making a good Bioshock. 




 You should watch Death Wish with Kevin Bacon and also watch John Wick. Both of those feel like what a Max Payne movie should be. 




 Maybe directed by Paul Thomas Anderson? I feel like he could definitely pull off the atmosphere and style.

Edit:Sorry for my opinion? 




 I guess I was just really looking for a camera that "sees" well in amy lighting condition without loss of quality. Sort of how a human can perceive things well in incredibly low light situations and very bright situations.

And thank you for the response! It was very informative!  




 I'm kind of a newbie so I have a question.

What camera/camera settings/lens combination, in your experience, replicates the range of light and colors humans see with their eyes the closest?

Using only natural lighting, have you found a lens/camera combo that replicates what we see with our naked eyes? 




 So are there suits that have more flex than others? Something stretchy? I have a pair of pants that have spandex(?) woven into them so that they have some flex to them. I find these pants extremely comfortable. Are there full suits that have some stretch to them? Something that will give me a wider range of motion? 









 So I just saw John Wick and really liked it, but I was kind of distracted by the CGI blood. I'm a huge advocate for practical effects like actual squibs. However I totally understand the benefits of CGI blood like not having to clean up your set or actors or wardrobe when you reset a shot. So it logistically makes sense. And there are examples of good CGI of organic things like water. 

So why is CGI blood still kind of bad for the most part and are there any examples where the CGI blood and gore looked really good? 




 I don't think they're nitwits. Them not liking the movie isn't what bothers me. What bothers me is that they are so objective about it, yet only cite the story and structure without going into detail as the reason for it being bad. They refuse to have a discussion about it. I love discussing movies I love with people that don't like them! Of course all while being civil and respectful. 




 So I really love the Tree of Life and my friends don't. I'm fine with this. People like different things. This doesn't bother me. What bothers me is that they say it's a "shit movie" and it's "terrible". They don't say they *think* it's bad they will say "No, dude, Tree of Life is bad."

This didn't use to bother me because my friends are the kind of movie goes who would rather watch an action movie. Not that there is anything wrong with that. So I just chalked it up to the fact that it's just a very different movie than what they are used to.

But then my film friend, a guy I've known since high school and talk movies with all the time, recently watched it. I thought, "Finally, someone who appreciates all kinds of movies will watch this with me." We watch it and I'm like, "Now I know someone else who will like it and I can talk to him about it." But alas, he also tells me it's pretty terrible.

So this got me thinking, am I missing something? Again, it's totally fine that my friends don't like Tree of Life. What bugs me is that they will objectively say it's a bad film. So artistic stuff aside, is The Tree of Life *technically* a bad movie?

Their reasoning is that the story is bad and say it's too hard to follow. 

So now I'm genuinely curious, is it bad technically? Am I biased because of how the movie affected me emotionally? So much so to where I cannot view it objectively?

Edit: I just want to clarify that I'm not here to pander. I seriously want to discuss the technical aspects of this film and the structure of the story. 




 I might be interested in theater work whether it be on stage or behind the scenes. Where can I go for info on upcoming auditions and what not? 




 Paul Thomas Anderson doing a horror movie would be incredible. 




 Geeze, honestly, who fucking cares? There has been a lot of Mormon stuff on here lately for some reason, and every time there is all I have to say is "Who fucking cares?" This applies to all posts about religion. 




 I still think Shame is McQueen's best film. 




 I also find it frustrating when people just refuse to believe he has any talent. They just go, "Michael Bay? Total shit director." He's actually a damn fine director. The man can direct action like no other. Despite whatever opinions people have on the artistic value of Bad Boys II, I still think it's one of the best action movies from a directing standpoint. 




 Why? It's a giant Hollywood action/adventure epic. Did you expect them to cast racially accurate actors over actors with star power? 




 Everyone keeps talking about how great Tom Hardy was but no one is talking about how great matthias schoenaerts did! That dude is Belgian and English is not his first language and he did a fantastic job.  
























 Sorry if the title is slightly confusing. I'm not great with words.

I saw Ant Man and while I did think it was a good movie, I couldn't help but constantly think about what could've been if Edgar Wright was still the director.

I felt the same way watching the Steve Jobs biopic trailer. At some point David Fincher was suppose to direct with Christian Bale starring. I thought it was a perfect combination. I couldn't help but think what could've been while watching the trailer. Though I love Fassbender and Danny Boyle so I'm still holding on to hope.

Are there other films you can think of where someone was originally involved with a project from the beginning, but left early on, leaving it for someone else to continue? Did it ruin it for you because you were you thinking about what could've been? Do you wish that person had stayed or are you happy they left? Do you think it was for the better or worse?

 See I don't know why people are championing for Idris Elba so hard when it will absolutely never happen. He's already 42 years old.  




 So why is everyone against this? He has the look. He has the acting ability  




 So with Daniel Craig being nearly done with the role, it'll be almost time for a new actor as Bond. Obviously we don't know what era of Bond they go with, but if they went for a younger Bond, I think Matthew Lewis would be absolutely perfect for the role. Just an idea I wanted to get out there. I would link to some photos but I'm on mobile.  




 She turned olive drab into totally fab! 




 Oh snap you're right. Totally forgot about that one! 




 Paul Thomas Anderson doing horror. His films are already super tense. Imagine if he was actually trying to strike fear in your heart. 

Terrence Malick doing action or crime. 

David Fincher doing horror as well. 

Christopher Nolan doing a war movie. His scale and scope would fit this. WWII, Vietnam, Iraq, future war, etc. Any setting would work. 

Again, Terrence Malick, but doing a super hero movie. His God/Nature vs man, good vs evil themes would work well in this setting.  




 Reverse psychology. Op secretly wants to be upvoted.  




 Good luck to everyone.  




 Wow. Just wow. You have a horrible attitude that is absolutely toxic for any creative environment. 

So no one in the film business should be there if they have a love or passion for it? You don't have a love or passion for it? You're just there for the paycheck?

If you ask me, based on what I've heard, you're the one who's there for the wrong reasons. Not them. 

Why even be in film if you don't have a love or passion for it? 




 I admire you for doing what you did, but What about people like me who cannot afford to move to a film hub? We just don't deserve to do film? You're basically saying people who are unable are undeserving. You're telling people to not even bother trying. 

It may not be my career but it's my passion so screw you or anyone else that has the audacity to say I don't deserve to do it because of where I live. 

Film isn't just a career, dude. It's an art and anyone anywhere can do art.  




 I'm 21 years old. I work hard for little pay. Barely enough to support myself. I love making films. I live in a city where the film community is very very small. I simply cannot afford to live in a city where there is a budding film community.

I don't think it's right to judge someones love and dedication to film because of where they live. That's just ignorant. Some people simply can't afford to just pack up their lives and move to a new city. 




 I'm a big film guy. Done a few shorts. I'd love to help out 




 Yes 




 Nope. I'm adding an edit in the post to be more descriptive. But the environment the people were in was normal. 




 I believe it was foreign? Everyone was humping things throughout the video. 

Edit: The environment the people were in was normal. 




 Samsara. Basically shows a bunch of different cultures with zero dialogue so no language barrier.  




 Some of these really aren't bad. Especially for their time. Sure, when you compare them to today, of course they'll look bad.  




 I see mad max fury road in that word cloud.  









 So I don't read comics so the tone might be right, but I was under the impression that Suicide Squad was going to be a fun, dark comedy action movie. Sort of like a Bad Boys or Hot Fuzz. This trailer made it appear way more serious than I was expecting. Not that I'm complaining, just unexpected. Looks great! 




 No one has said it, but Honeymoon. Watch it. It's on Netflix. It's like 80 minutes. And it's *pure* atmosphere. Really creepy. Very mysterious. I found myself saying, "what is going on?" constantly, in a good way. I've found that the ending is what divides most people, but it's still worth a watch. Very solid, atmospheric horror. Watch it.  




 It reminded me a lot of Limitless in some ways even though their stories aren't that similar. I can't tell you why I kept thinking of limitless, but I did for some reason.

The biggest disappointment for me was the visuals. I'm a huge fan of Tarsem Singh because even if his movies aren't great, like Immortals, at least they are gorgeous. I realize that Self/Less isn't a visual masterpiece because it's setting doesn't lend itself to that being a for the most part realistic modern setting. 

It doesn't take place in a fantasy world, or dreams, or ancient Greece. It's modern America. But that's why I see Singh films, so I was disappointed.

The film frustrated me because there are plenty glimpses of brilliance in there that they don't really do much with. This film had the potential to be a great, original sci fi flick, but everytime it starts getting interesting it turns back into a generic thriller.

The acting was unfortunately the best part for me. And I say unfortunately because I wish everything else was better. Everyone does a pretty great job in their roles though. Even the little girl I thought was fine.

My main gripe though is that it easily could've been a great film. So much wasted potential. They managed to turn a pretty great, original sci-fi idea into a generic movie, and that's the worst thing about it for me. 




 I also thought it was weird that Ryan was so appalled to learn that the dude donated his body to save his daughter. Like, it makes sense and is a great sacrifice.

I think it's funny that the entire film wouldn't have happened if he did what Goode said and just didn't poke around.

Also, I kind of ended up agreeing with Goode's character, Albright. He was kind of right in that most medical breakthroughs had sacrifices. Reynolds was just being a nosy ungrateful dude.   




 I got really excited about a short film idea and stayed up all night writing. Wrote a 17 page first draft in about 7 hours. 




 My two entries. I'm really looking forward to getting feedback being a new writer, as well as reading other people's entries.

 As someone who knows quite a few girls who are into horses, you are right.  




 These are easily the two best blurays out there. 




 The Matrix. Blew me away. It didn't just make me see film as an art, but it also made me want to be a filmmaker so now I make stuff and it's all because of that movie. 




 This is some top notch editing 




 Where the heck did you find a True Detective steel  




 Drive 




 Punch Drunk Love? 




 You're right, I completely forgot about Guardians of the Galaxy. And I haven't seen Winter Soldier but I hear it's great. When I say style, I mean more in how it's directed and shot, not what style of film it is. I do agree with you that they feel different, but they don't look particularly different except for GotG. I think that's because as time has gone on, Marvel studios has turned more into a factory. Directors have less and less say because of the vision Marvel has for its universe. 

Aside from GotG, I think most of them are visually bland and uninteresting. I get that they have to look like they are connected but still, I can't help but not care about what I'm looking at when I see a Marvel movie now. But that's just me being a "visuals" snob. I think that's why personally I'm more excited about BvS. When Zack Snyder and Larry Fong get together, it's always interesting. Now whether it'll be a good film or not is very 50/50, but boy will it be pretty. 

I just want it to be clear that I'm not faulting anyone who likes and enjoys Marvel movies. They are well made films. 

Edit: It's just, like, my opinion, man.  




 They did something unique then proceeded to do it over and over and over and over again. Marvel, while technically good, has gone stale for me. Ant Man was the first Marvel film I was actually excited for since the first Avengers. Then Edgar Wright left and took his style with him. Obviously I haven't seen Ant Man yet, but I'm expecting another Marvel cookie cutter film.

People can argue all they want about how good or bad Batman vs Superman looks, but one thing's for sure, it oozes style. Something that has been lacking in Marvel movies lately for me. 




 I still say quotes from the thief to this day 




 I really hate this post. It's entirely pointless and pandering. You very well know this is a well loved movie here. And if you didn't, then you should've used the search function because it would've yielded many posts talking about the movie in a positive way. 

This post serves one purpose: to pander. I wish the mods were better about removing post that clearly pander.  




 But supposedly Ving cut himself shaving and showed up with a band aid and Tarantino told him to leave it on because he liked it.  




 What do you mean by flat profile? 




 I don't really know anything about cinematography, is this suppose to help us determine the suns position so we can account for it? How does this tool help me? What do I use it for?

I'm not trying to sound ungrateful or smart, I just genuinely don't know. Thanks!   




 Some friends and I are wanting to make a short film. Our budget is very small and the short takes place entirely outdoors. What are some tips from yourself, articles, or videos that will guide us, and help us shoot some good looking footage outside on a shoestring budget?

 Rob Schneider as older, bald Max Payne from Max Payne 3. Seriously. I think he has the capacity to be a great actor given a role that lets him act serious.  




 The heat index for my city will be in the high 90's-low 100's. I'm in need of some shorts, but haven't had any real luck finding some good ones.

What are some brands that are good, and which should I stay away from?

Are certain styles better than others? I know it's mostly preference, but what should I be looking for? What shorts, in your experience, have worked well for you? 




 Not according to The Matrix 




 I'd love to see more posts like this on r/movies. Bringing unknown, great movies to light and exposing them to new people. 




 I know he's fallen off lately, but back when Just Cause 2 came out, I thought it'd be a perfect film for Robert Rodriguez.  




 I agree. I'm not even sure Spec Ops is filmable. 




 But *so* much of RDR is influenced by, and references, other western films in terms of it's setting, style, story and characters that I'm not sure how well it'd work. 




 It won't be two hours. In today's day and age, TLOU would for sure get two more sequels. So, in theory, with 3 movies it could work, but the game was around 20 hours so it'd *still* feel rushed. 




 I don't think it was so much he already had his mind made up as much as it was him just acknowledging that it wasn't a movie geared towards him and his taste. And while I do think it's important to review a movie based on what it is and not what you want it to be, I do think there is something to be said for reviewing a movie based off of who you are. Makes it a little easier to judge if you'd like a movie or not. For example, if I find I agree and generally have the same views as a certain reviewer, then it helps me determine if I'd like a movie or not.

It should also be said that Filmdrunk is a personality driven site by comedians. They aren't interested in objectively talking about movies. They enjoy speaking subjectively about them. They know they aren't, and never claim, to be the best, or most informative reviewers. 

Yes they can be very cynical, but that's just their personalities. And it should be said that they all have very different personalities and opinions. This is just one dude.  




 And it's not just visually beautiful, it's also thematically beautiful.  




 I'm a nice guy 




 And that's it. I can't remember the name but I'd like to find it 




 Is none going to talk about how hilariously ridiculous Vincent D'Onofrio's plan for a raptor army was? Still a way better movie than I was expecting though.  




 In my experience, I kind of have to. I don't know and can't afford an editor *and* a cinematographer *and* a director *and* a writer etc. 

Sometimes you just have to do it all yourself. It's more stressful and harder, but you do what you gotta do. It's worked out alright for me in the past. 

When your just starting out, unless you have a lot of money, people, professionals, usually won't work for free. Now if you have previous work that is good, some might because it shows potential. But a lot of the times, at least for me, the only way to start a portfolio is to do some shorts where you're doing everything. 

However, it also depends on the scope of the project as well as your budget.  




 Willravel 2015 




 I remember when Gravity first came out and anyone who said anything negative about it was downvoted because everyone thought it was the second coming or something. 




 I'm with you. What happened in Up is just life. It's natural. Now if she died young that'd be terrible, but it seems like besides the failed pregnancy, they lived a rather happy life. They were able to grow old together. 

Now Interstellar, he couldn't be there. The realization that twenty something years had just gone by was soul shattering. Him watching his kids grow old without him, knowing he missed it all. That's not natural. That's hell for a parent.  









 Blood is pretty dark irl though.

As someone who has studied forensics in school, it is not. When you have a lot of blood condensed in a small area, it's dark. But blood, like you would get from a spray from a gunshot is very red. Even pooled blood is red. The deeper the blood, the darker it gets obviously, but blood from a typical gunshot or stab wound is red. The blood isn't thick/deep enough for it to appear dark.

But it doesn't take any sort of specialist to know this. Look at any pictures of crime scenes or surgeries and you'll see. Fresh blood is red. 




 I think short term 12 is a really good well made film. But the thing is, it's nothing groundbreaking. It's just a really good drama. I honestly don't understand why it gets so highly praised. 




 So I think this movie was very good, however I think I ruined it for myself. I was going into it with the expectation of crying my eyes out and having this huge emotional ride. I never got to that point. I kind of felt this movie just fizzled out. The climax wasn't that high for me. I dunno. Like I said, this movie is still very very good and the acting is great. 




 I really really love romance movies like The Proposal. Movies where someone asks someone else to pretend to be their spouse or significant other in order to fool some person(s). However, in the process of pretending, they, of course, actually do fall in love. 

Are there more movies like this? I'm sure there has to be, right? 




 Legend's wife seems *super* drunk 




 The writing wasn't terrible, the acting was good, the cinematography was good, and the directing was fine. In fact, it's no secret that a lot was cut for theatrical release. 

It's an average film, and if it wasn't a remake, people would be okay with it. I've seen both. I strongly believe that if people have the ability to see both, they should choose the original. Just like everyone else. However, if you only had the option to see the Lee one, for whatever reason, it's not bad. 

It's subpar to the original, but for the most part tells the same story without much change. That's why it's not a bad remake. Just unnecessary. As a film though, from a technical standpoint, it's not bad.  




 No it's not. Is it unnecessary? Yes. Is it bad? Not at all.  




 So my day started at, like, 3 am? I went to bed early then woke up waaay earlier than I wanted to. Oh well, took advantage of the time and finished up Bloodline! That show's pretty great. Got very suspenseful towards the end. Finale left me with mixed feelings. Still, great overall.

Had breakfast at around, I dunno, 6 maybe? More eggwhites. This time with spinach and chicken. Get dat protein. Then a tangerine. Started working on my film resume. Took a nap then went to work.

Work suuuuuuccckkks. Super slow. Strange customers. Ugh, I hate people. Waling around. Moving things. Not buying stuff. This lady was there walking around till after close and I'm just like "gtfo"

Had chicken and veggies for dinner. Should've seasoned the veggies...

Watched Wayward Pines. I have no idea what's going on in this show.

My mom and sister's birthday is tomorrow. They have the same birthday. *Still* haven't gotten a card. I'm a bad brother/son!

Think I might clean tomorrow. *Maybe*.

Really hyped about Mad Max this weekend! I'm seeing it with Zach and Kevin, my besties. It's gonna be sick!

Maybe I'll watch movies all day tomorrow. 




 Finally finished my film resume. Put that off waaaay too long. Now I just have to send it in and cross my fingers.

Man, if I get this job I can finally say I do film for a living. How cool is that? Goodbye retail, hello film production!

Knock on wood! 




 I've never applied for a position in film before. I finished my resume and demo reel. The company asked for them to be sent together. They gave an email to send it to, but no other info.

Do I send the resume as a PDF? On google drive? Dropbox?

Do I just include the link for the reel?

I realize this might vary from company to company, but since they gave no info, is there a standard way to do it? 




 So I guess this is the first "official" diary entry.

I'm assuming someone came in and downvoted everyone. Not just me, but the commenters. Not the environment I want to have, so I did something to prevent it in the future.

No more downvote arrow! Welcome to 1942 France!

No, but seriously it's not a diva thing of "how dare someone downvote me!" No, it's more about creating a non hostile environment. 

I started my diet and exercise this morning officially. Just a two week diet though. My cousin is getting married in two weeks and I wanna look decent in a suit. 

Diet is working so far. Had eggwhites this morning. I've been snacking on oranges and occasionally, tuna, throughout the day. I also went on a 3 mile walk. Already lost 2 pounds! It's nice to see results so soon.

Then I took a looooong nap. Felt great!

I wanted to get back down to 200lbs by August. I was 200lbs my senior year of high school, my peak physical fitness. Got 30lbs to go. Seems doable by August. I'm still kicking myself for not joining that gym back in January like I said I would. I am an artist and procrastination is my medium.

Other than that, not much has happened today.

Been talking to this girl. Real nice! We'll see how far this goes.

It's 9:48pm at the time of me writing this. Chicago PD is on in the background. That dudes voice is hilarious! I might spend the rest of my night watching the rest of Bloodline. I'm halfway through and I wanna finish before I forget what happens.

I dunno. Might play some Call of Duty? Oh yeah, I'm having PS4 problems. Forgot. Oh well. Maybe I'll play Rock Band 3?

Whatever, I'll figure something out.

 lol 




 So in the mean time while I figure out whether to let people post in this sub and what those posts should be, as well as the general nature of this sub, I thought it'd be a *hopefully* good idea to have a place where people could ask questions and make comments. Maybe you have an idea on how to make this strange subreddit work or maybe you just want to ask whatever. Either way, feel free to post it here.

 




 I'm trying to figure out the best way to run this place. You know, a way where things are organized.

Thinking about how to title stuff. Should I include a date in the title? I feel like that'd be redundant considering reddit will quasi-date things for me. Maybe I should just number stuff, like "Entry 1", "Entry 2" and so on.

Maybe I'll just abandon all attempts of organization and just post things how they happen.

What if I categorize the posts? That might work. Such as "Diary Entry", "Picture", etc. But then that means I have to come up with headings, which also means I need to put some forethought into this. *Maybe*.

Who knows? Eventually things will just organize themselves, right? That's how I made it through high school.

ATZ 




 This place is a diary of sorts. I'm test_subject6208, and though my life isn't interesting enough to warrant my own subreddit, I'm still doing it.

Why? I figured it'd be an outlet to talk about things anonymously, for the most part, while improving my writing skills at the same time.

I thought instead of just creating a massive post about who I am, I would just let things reveal themselves over time. Who I am as a person, my hobbies, likes, dislikes, my life, etc., will be revealed over time. I'll post "diary" entries that will be in the form of a text post, picture, or both. These entries will be about my days, thoughts, or whatever.

I've never been good at keeping a journal. Hopefully I'll be diligent with this. If Reddit stays around for a while, it might be an interesting, yet unconventional biography of sorts for whoever takes an interest in it.

ATZ

Edit: It should be said that my style of writing is more like free writing, but less organized. Entries will most likely be written as I say it in my head with little thought of what makes sense, if that makes sense?

Note: I tend to be sarcastic and hyperbolic when I write. I'm trying to lessen it, but it's a habit. Can you have writing habits? Either way, just keep it in mind.  









 Man that part when they're in the kitchen and she's just like "I don't love you anymore" and Gosling just starts crying. That ending is so rough. Beautiful film.  




 I'm an aspiring filmmaker, and it'd be awesome to mess around with it and make short films. 

I asked Rockstar but never got an answer.

Would director mode even work on consoles? 




 It's okay. *I* got your reference.  




 Yep, I think Pattinson stole the show in this one 




 So could they not just chop off the Silent Hills trailer at the end and re release it? 




 Going to a wedding in a few weeks. What are some good, trendy places around here that aren't very expensive? 




 Interesting, I actually find Cinema Sins more clever than Honest Trailers.

I also find it interesting that Red Letter Media gets so much love in /r/movies. They are very cynical about movies and are often harsh and, at least on Half in the Bag(their review show), appear to not really keep up with movies and not care about most modern big budget movies, which /r/movies loves. I love RLM though. 




 To make a long story short, I'm an aspiring filmmaker. Been working for years shooting various things. Never for profit. Finally, my work paid off. Met with someone that wrote a book that was being made into a film. Nothing big, they had a small budget. I was asked to help write then later, asked to direct. Things were coming together, we were just about to start writing. I then get news that they decided to hire professional writers and get a different director. I'm probably not involved anymore.

I'm not giving up filmmaking, but this was such a blow to the gut. Would love to eat this pain away.

 Bad Boys II 




 Wow, I had no idea and have not seen it before so I will definitely check it out, thank you! 




 Wow, that's a lot of candles, but it looks great, thank you! 




 Most definitely 




 Stoic isn't *that* bad 




 After looking through screenshots of various films it made me curious of the lighting set up of those scenes such as what were they using and where were they placed. Any places online that go into this? 




 I'm trying to find examples of films that were shot exclusively using practical lighting. However, google isn't yielding results. Do you know of any that were entirely or almost entirely practical lighting? 




 I'm co-adapting a book into a screenplay. The book, however is primarily narration with vey little dialogue. I'm struggling with coming up with ways of telling this story without it lacking any dialogue. 

The book features many characters interacting, but rarely with any dialogue. They *do* talk, but in the book, there's no dialogue for the conversation the characters are having.

The author expressed interest in the film being primarily narration, but I'm not sure how to do this without it being tedious, boring, or overdone.

Not really sure what to do. Any advice or examples of films that pull this off would be very helpful. Thank you guys in advance.

 Saw the title and misread it as a movie called Seven Soviet and thought it was a Russian retelling of Seven Samurai.  




 Ride with me.  




 Only took me, like, 15 minutes  




 This can be caused by the marketing, word of mouth, etc

I'm not necessarily saying they were intentionally misleading, but more so they appeared to be one kind of movie, but after seeing, turns out to be something else. 

My example is the film Martyrs. It's marketed as a horror and while it technically is horror, after seeing it it feels more like an emotional drama

Also The Babadook. For those who haven't seen it, it appears to be a horror film but after viewing, feels like a psychological family drama. 

Are there other films like this that aren't as they appear on surface level 




 The Wrestler 




 Yeah the same thing happens to me. Also, I followed an npc on foot and he just walked around the block continuously. 




 Absolutely watch New World! 




 To me it's because the tattoos make it look like he's *trying* to look crazy and unstable, whereas without them he just seems naturally crazy and unstable. 




 I have a somewhat general question. love editing, especially trailers. How does one get into it professionally? 




 [Neat](http://imgur.com/r/futurama/GGVHcO9)

 Was it really only 3 years? Feels way longer 




 Or just have it be the after credits scene.  




 I know this isn't the type of thing that you would normally turn into a post, and I wouldn't be surprised if only a few people saw it, but I had to get it out because it's too perfect. 

What if Showgirls wasn't made when it was and instead was made today. And what if it wasn't directed by Paul Verhoven(?)? Who would be the best director for the Showgirls of the 2010s? 

Nicholas Winding Refn. 

I know Refn is a name that sometimes gets jerked around here, but bear with me. The story I think would fit his style. This strange crime-esque story with not so normal characters. Not to mention how well the Vegas Strip would work with his visual style. 

I'm just saying a Refn directed Showgirls could be awesome. 

So I guess the discussion part would be, if Refn directed Showgirls, would it be good? Or is showgirls so bad no director could save it? 









 No Country for Old Men  




 Thank you! I totally realized it was long but I wasn't sure what to keep and what to throw out. I knew not too long after starting that I didn't have a whole lot of work. Unfortunately, the place I'm applying at asked for a resume *and* a reel. Because the local production company is relatively small, the job is basically a general all around job, looking for people with experience in editing, producing, writing, and directing, which I *do* have experience in, but I wasn't sure how the reel was supposed to show all of these things. 

 




 I made a reel for a job for a local production company. I've never made a reel before. I put [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0By3l0nVnUv1hb2dlUE82WUppZlU/view?usp=sharing) one together, however it needs some serious work and should be way shorter.

What shots should I take out? What shots should be shorter? How can I improve this reel? 




 I really dig the [score](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hT1eNQWO9tY list=PLQCXD9Nsb1yZqmThf9wvxx5kTkd_RdKO8 index=14) for Birdman. This cool, jazzy, improv sounding percussions sound. What else will I like that is this style? 




 Was really hoping we'd see a Jaa vs The Rock fight 




 Title 




 I'm applying for a job and have never made a reel before.

1. What should be in the reel?

2. How long should it be?

3. Where do I upload it to?

4. Are there any good online guides to making a good reel?

5. Should my reel have a coherent flow that connects the shots?

Edit: I'm applying for a general writer/director/producer position at a small local production company.  









 I believe.  




 Glad to hear Spy is pretty good 




 I give it massive points for being something new and original. Every time I thought I knew where it was going, it went somewhere else. 

That said, I think the ending felt really rushed. It's wired, throughout most of the movie I felt like these two people really loved each other, but by the end it felt rushed and I didn't really feel that way about the characters anymore. I understand that the movie couldn't be longer but I wish it was. It's a pretty dense movie. There's a lot you don't understand throughout most of it, then when it reveals things it feels like an information overload. Not that that's a bad thing, but I wish it took its time to explain things. 

I really really loved the first 3 quarters but feel very lukewarm about the 4th quarter. And because of it, I came away with an overall lukewarm impression of the film. 

Like I said, it's great that it took a risk at being something unique, and honestly, it *is* unique. I just wish I liked it more.  




 I'm getting a haircut and I really like the look of Trent Reznor's hair. I'm having trouble figuring out how long it is though due to how dark his hair is. Anyone got an idea of how long the top and sides are?

 With Keanu getting older, I could see Josh playing Spike if Cowboy Bebop ever moves forward.  




 There are few things worse than when a movie has a good villain, but they give them an unsatisfying ending, what examples do you have?

Spoilers obviously 




 Because it's not really scary. More creepy than anything. It really doesn't hold up well.  




 I find it super interesting that Only God Forgives was too much for you and Valhalla Rising is your favorite.  




 Any particular ones you recommend? I went to EZ Pawn and the selection was super lackluster. Pretty much just TVs and power tools and a few instruments. 




 So I have two unrelated questions and instead of making two posts, I thought I'd consolidate.

Q1) What are some places that would have some good variety of men's hair products for sale? 

Q2) What are some pawn shops that usually have some good things and aren't *super* sketchy?  




 Meeska mooska 




 I don't like love ballads for some reason. 









 What song and what artist? 




 But with the callouses you would build from not wearing shoes, you wouldn't even need any shoes! Built in shoes rule! 









 You and me both.  




 Yes and no. According to the contest, if you were a rich dude, yeah you could pay a large sum to go to the premiere, but you aren't guaranteed to *win* and hang with RDJ. It's still chance and you'd only be increasing your chance to win. I mean, if I payed $50,000 and got 500,000 entries, there's still the chance, however small, I'll still lose and not meet RDJ.

Bad example, but at my middle school dance, there was a raffle for an Xbox and you payed $1 for 1 raffle ticket and could buy as many as you want. People were paying upwards to $50 or more. But the dude who won it only bought 1 ticket.

Miracles happen, man! 




 So in /r/animalsbeingjerks, they have a way to filter all of the posts if you wanted to see just cat posts or dog posts or bird posts etc. I don't know what the labels would be, but I think that could work here.  




 Yea I went to Blu-Ray.com and it has nothing on this one. Really hoping it's good  




 Cool! 




 Finally! Can't wait to get Equilibrium on bluray! 




 Also, the pacing of the movie is impeccable! It never drags 




 I love everything David Fincher has done, but for me, it'd have to be The Social Network. I just feel like this was the movie where David Fincer really took every technique he had learned and combined them together. Everything in that film came together perfectly. And you can feel so much of TSN's influence in his later work such as Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, Gone Girl, and even House of Cards. I always thought David Fincher was a great director, but The Social Network really elevated him a whole new level. Yes Seven, Fight Club, and Zodiac are great, but I feel TSN was the movie where *everything* just perfectly came together. No single part felt subpar compared to the other parts. The Social Network is just a much more efficient machine than anything he's done before and since The Social Network. But again, I love everything Fincher has done.  




 This is such a great movie that no one ever talks about 




 If this isn't /r/Retiredgif material, I don't know what is.  




 They were just like "Your wife is on the phone" and space ghost said" tell her I'm dead" 




 It was a super funny clip and I cannot find it anywhere. I don't think it was the one with Bjork? 




 I thought this was really bad. Whatever they were trying to achieve, I felt they missed the mark by a lot. 

It may be parody or satire, but despite the creator's intentions, it honestly looks more like a failed attempt to make an "adult" Power Rangers than an attempt to satire "gritty" action movies. 




 Exactly, people are like, "I can't believe no one realizes this is a joke!" but the thing is, despite the fact that it's supposed to be a joke/parody/satire, it's a really bad short. Mediocre at best. The reason some people don't see it as parody or satire is because it does such a horrendous job of portraying that.

Despite the creator's intentions, it honestly looks more like a failed attempt to make an "adult" Power Rangers than an attempt to satire "gritty" action movies. 




 Is there a lyric that really stands out to you as great in a, for the most part, mediocre/bad song? 




 I was thinking about this while listening to the radio on my way home.

Is there a lyric that really stands out to you as great in a, for the most part, mediocre/bad song? 




 I still honestly believe that the difference between 24 and 30 is not that noticeable. Yes 30 is smoother than 24, but not by that much. It's all just opinion. 




 I don't think there is a noticeable difference between 24 and 30. I've shot short films in 24, 30, and 60 and I think 30 is close enough to 24 to where it isn't a big enough difference to matter. 

And I don't think it's just the frame rate that makes it more filmic. Like you said, aspect ratio, color grading, and cinematography are involved. Which The Order, I think, has some really filmic cinematography going on with its lighting. Some of the shots look straight out of a film. The aspect ratio also helps in this. I think The Order is an example of "What if we made a film into a game."

I'm not trying to defend this games short comings. I too think that the game is overpriced and probably won't be good. But I think out of all the weird decisions they've made, the 30 fps thing is the most believable and makes the most sense, even if they are just covering up a problem. 

I'm not saying that it's right for them to make it 30. I think it's very important for games to be 60 because every frame counts and can be the difference between success and failure. But if they are going for a more filmic and cinematic look, which it looks like they are, then 30 makes *some* sense. Or at least a little informed.  




 I'm just saying that with 60fps things are super smooth. But with 30 it just looks more filmic. So it does make some sense to me at least.  




 To be fair, there *is* a more "cinematic look" with 30fps vs 60fps. Not saying it's smart or the right thing to do, but I think they're being honest about that at least.
