 that's a good point too particular event or people. 




 So a connection to some particular event? yeah i can see that, thanks! 




 Yeah, uniqueness and power level of the game, i guess if everyone has it it become common. that's a good point 




 When i said no "story" answer i mean a comment that is just literally written "story"

yes stakes and hassle to get it. 




 Yes, thank you this is what i meant when i asked the question, characteristics that legendary things have

I think a "price" to pay for a legendary weapon is a must.

Also as you said the power level of the campaign matters too that's something to keep in mind too. 




 To you guys aside from stats what characteristics makes something considered epic or legendary and plz no answer like "story" please give an answer with some dept, if you want to use something you made as example i'm all for it.

As of now the characteristics i got are

Uniqueness

Means and stakes of obtaining it

Background story

The better, the worst, as in it's good but it's power comes at a price.

A connection to a certain event or people 




 I'm a Mage: the awakening player and alot of people recommend Ars magica to me, me being somewhat tired of Mage listened to some suggestions and Ars magica popped out more than a couple of time as some call it the predecessor to mage.

Are the more conceptual Arcana equivalent such as Fate, Time and so on still there or accessible in some way? or are the mages "weaker" in comparison to Mages from Awakening?

It seems a much more detailed system such as the labs and such which Awakening refuses to put in more detail about alot of things, which i understand but it takes me out of it somewhat.

Also a problem i had with Awakening such that mages seemed too alike magic wise by that i mean you had no reason to be "creative" in most situations and even then it was hard to set mage apart from one another as the player  has almost no way to go about being "creative" i'm having trouble explaining it so i don't except help here. 




 It looks really sleek, i like colored sheets,dude i would advise making a black and white one and a colored one i fucking love this design! keep it up! 




 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobilis

I haven't played Nobilis yet (can't find groups accepting people) so i'm reading the core, 3rd ed btw, is the one i'm reading, yh the one with cancerous art...but it's the newest so i went with that, don't know any better

I have general problems understanding the game but the attributes just pin me to the ground how do they work?!

Please explain them to me. 




 So i have been trying to make a magic system for fate core and this is by no means finished it's just an idea and i'm trying to get the idea of it before the mechanics, here's what i have in mind.

i thought of magic working like the materia from FF7 as in switch them and make them stronger through use, i have taken the habit to go to the super power wiki and taking a look at the powers and checking them out

Let me give you an example let's say the gm gives a player the following Materias:

Fire manipulation.

Then he chooses the applications

Applications would be the uses of the power you start with two of those and with milestones in game you would give the Materia (i'l get to that) access to more application, of course the gm dictates what is "legal" as an application because some of them have applications that could ruin a game.

So the players chooses these as he would choose aspects of sorts:

Create/Generate/increase,shape. (this counts as one, the gm might think otherwise tough)

Flame Solidification.

and he would choose stunts called techniques if he wants for ways to use these powers with greater mastery such as Pyrokinetic Constructs for flame solidification.

that's what i got for this step, it's not very well translated from what i have in mind but it's an approximation

Now i thought this stuff is way too op and it is ,so i decided that using Materia recklessly would make you go insane instead of using a mana sort of thing.

When a player fails to cast a Materia properly he rolls a skill that the gm finds appropriate, the player is encouraged to give suggestions to the gm as in what skill he should roll, to circumvent a disaster.

the gm says what could happen as in what the calamity would be either bad for the caster or for people around him.

Example: The Player with the fire Materia tries to fling a fireball at someone,he rolls, he fails , so the gm says "well, you have a big fireball in your hand and it's about to blow up in your face and burn everyone around you, you lost control of the flames."

The player might suggest "i want to use my WILL to stop the flame from blowing up by concentrating to appease the flames " 

The gm agrees, next time this happens he might choose another way the spell could go wrong always withing the powers of the Materia tough. the player rolls he succeeds but what if he had failed? well the player could use a fate point to negate any negative implications or endure the consequences, this might seem way to cruel but with the appearance of more powerful Materias this is a must.

But of course the gm is expected to offer worse implications to botching a power of greater magnitude as in things getting way way worse for having greater power means greater possible destruction.

Botching a spell completely makes everything go bat-shit crazy and that includes you for a while it scales with level of failure.

I have more but what do you guys think as of now? 





























 and some with good modding community if no magic system?

Good as in interesting magic systems. 














 It says on the official page one of the reviews say that it's similar to Nobilis, that's why i said that. 




  Mythender

People say it's like Nobilis do you know more about the system?

As in how do powers work and such?

Also game's free, awsome. 




 Although in french it looks like a good and original system what i don't seem to like is the limited number or powers and such, but i may try to house rule some more in there.

I like the weapons having free will, i can already imagine a paladin with a murderous rapist sword, you know, classy stuff, like in the example of the guy saving two girls and the sword wanting a "peculiar reward" against the wielder's will. 




 How powerful can a rifts character become? 




 How powerful can a character be? 




 I love those kinds of systems, i know about Nobilis, Chuubo, Don't rest your head, Mage the awakening, amber dice less one thing i disliked about amber is it's short array of powers, i like having alot of room to choose.

Also giving little more info on how powerful can a character be would be great. 
























 add sci-fi stuff to swords axes and other old weapons
i thought mini thruster behind the blade to propel it and a retractable chain mechanism on the handle to the wrist of the user in case it's dropped

without going into the most seen things such as laser blades and such.
i don't care if they wouldn't be used because blah blah guns blah
 




 that's a very low power abilty more fit to be a trait of your character
think weirder and bigger. 




 Outcome: "You're knocked over, your action is interrupted and your face smarts."
This anime-inspired gift is a nigh-unblockable technique to inflict mild pain upon ones opponent and interrupt whatever mundane action they're performing at the time.
At One-trick Utility, this particular version can activate only in response to an offense to the user (insult or attack to user or people they care about).
Given that, however, the user is free to describe different methods of attack (slap, giant hammer, high kick, high-velocity football, etc) that all do the same thing.

If a Noble with this Gift messes up or does something really embarrassing, then it erases the memories of everyone who saw him foul up. It won't actually undo any of the physical consequences of his mistake, but it'll make sure no one rubs it in his face. Note that because this Gift is limited to local range, it won't help if the Noble's screw-up is somehow broadcast to other people, like over television or radio.

A Noble with the Seven League Step can cross extremely long distances in a matter of seconds! Each use of this Gift lets him cover about ten miles of distance as he runs as superhumanly fast speeds. This is way faster than the speed of sound, so this might cause a sonic boom if you're in a place where stuff like that happens.

This Gift, designed for the Power sworn not to kill, causes their actions never to kill anybody, no matter what. In fact, it becomes more or less impossible for anyone in the Power's presence to die other than of natural causes, unless a miracle is used with the specific intent to kill. Otherwise, regardless of the level of collateral damage, everybody lands safely in a dumpster, or is shot in the arm, or can be thawed out later with no lasting effects.

If you want the mechanical rules i can also post that. 




 Traveller i hear is pretty complex and yet it's one of the most beloved games. 




 to put it simply the players play as incarnation of reality , a piece of it, whatever the players want they can have as their estate ,fire,libraries,lakes,cats with green eyes, that feeling when you heard a sound while listening to music, etc

and to that comes the fun for the gm, atleast for me, it seems it's one of the few games where the Gm is actually playing and not just being an engine so the others have fun, more on that in a bit.

the players are a family bound by the same imperator and reside in the chancel their duty is to protect their aspect of reality and the chancel and nothing else, atleast it should be that way but Nobles (the beings you play) are most emotional beings and have their drives so that means feuding in some cases (which can be great fun, stealing Fate's collection of profecyzing toad pets and use them to predict what good shows are coming on tv in the future and which one suck)

Nobles are very hard to kill, straight up combat between nobles is frowned upon and seen as barbaric, backstabbing and other less flashy kind of attacks are prefered, keep in mind Nobles are EXTREMELY hard to kill, it CAN be done but you have to REALLY want to kill that dude (if he's mortal, immortality is a measly 6 poins) by ye old way of kicking but, be smart and use your estate and less "direct" ways (Such as Domain and Person) to inflict damage

ruin their name, destroy things that belong to their estates, The Noble of Oceans would be greatly weakened if somone happened to drink the mediterranean (aspect 8 miracle)

 




 Oh please yes Nobilis is my favorite game it's just unique. 




 Gurps is what comes to mind if we're talking about complex but playable if you want so complex that it's like calculus in college level of complex the unholy trinity has something for you. 




 Nobilis is a diceless system where you play an incarnation of piece of reality ranging from Thunder,Lakes,Sight to cats-that-have-green-eyes. and have total control over it.

"Gifts are the "skills" in Nobilis. They work pretty much like miracles with one exception. Miracles are flexible and mutable. They can adapt to any situation as deemed so. Gifts cannot.

A gift is "purchased" at character creation and it can be used by a character any time they deem necessary without any need to expend Miracle Points. A single gift can do anything, from a single task to several of them separately, only imagination and the HGs judgment limits it's creation."

show me your creativity. 




 I recently got the realm reborn ost but alot of tracks have come out since then, anyone know where i can get the new ones? 




 i don't understand the math or reason behind both. 
























 My favorite rpg is Nobilis would this be expected to be to my liking? 




 I know that combat is not the focus and that spells aren't worth it but i'd still like to be able to create my own (with rulesystem) even if that means my character won't use them mostly. 




 I know magic is hard and has repercussion but i still want to play a sorceror type of character and would the system be apopriate for something based of SCP?

freeform system would be best if there is such a thing as in M:taw or rules for spell creation. 




 Would i be able to play as a character made for Nobilis (As in the players are incarnations of an aspect of reality ie: fire, swords,cats-with-blue-eyes,etc?) the characters are IMMENSlY powerful beings limited to their resources (miracle points) that can only be recharged when they role-play well(It' kinda tricky to get them back so most just hoard them for a long long time). 

some of them are immortal tough as in immortal cannot die kind of way.

they have complete control over their aspect (if they can spend the MP for it) BUT they also must protect it otherwise he will get weaker and weaker until that aspect is completly removed from existence.

and some have items or abilities that are very powerful but also cost MP to use.

i think it'd be fun mortal characters interacting with characters like that striking deals with "Gods" and such.

Could this be the dat where i find a Sandbox game that allows me to play with my characters from Nobilis?

If you'd like more details or wanna discuss things feel free to do ask. 




 FU? 




 looks cool enough

My favorite rpg is Nobilis would this be a good alternative? 




 Nobilis could probably fit. 




 Is creating characters on the fly easy? 




 Are there setting less superhero-ish? without all the spandex and stuff more in the line of infamous?

how does combat drag out? 





























 how would you make Stormbringer in shadowrun?





Stormbringer is the name of the infamous black sword featured in a number of fantasy stories by the author Michael Moorcock. Created by the forces of Chaos, it is described as a huge, black sword covered with strange runes carved deep into its blade.

This powerful enchanted black blade is a member of a demon race that takes on the form of a sword, and as such is an agent of Chaos. Stormbringer's edge is capable of cutting through virtually any material not protected by potent sorcery, and it can drink the soul from (and thereby kill) an unprotected human upon delivering any wound, even a scratch. Its most distinctive features are that it has a mind and will of its own, and that it feeds upon the souls of those it kills. 




 I suggest posting some examples. 




 fantasy,science-fantasy etc gibe plz.

post a short description of supposed appearance, behavior,etc. 




 I never played it but i very much enjoy games who emphazise roleplaying and while i know the base setting dosen't have magic. there was a supplement with more setting and did that add the possibility of magic to the game?

how does it work?
alternativly if not how would magic be implemented?

http://www.pelgranepress.com/?cat=222 




 To me the game scream freeform-magic system how would you make  it work? 




 how often does it happen to you?

i did it all the time worst was with gurps and nwod i just freeze when i have to come up with stuff on the spot ,encounters are by far the worst experiences i had, maybe i'm just not made for GMming

 stating up stuff just stops the game and the players just stare and that's when the doodoo hits the fan in a panic i just blurr out something stupid and try to go around the issue in the stupidest ways as in nwod i just rolled for health and hit die for combat.
or had to bail them out because i threw a monster too strong that they couldn't handle i guess in that aspect it's their fault aswell for not trying to go beyong i have stick and want kill dragon hit dragon with stick until dead. 




 lol yeah could've said a little more than that. 




 what were your experiences with it, how fast does it play and how fast is it easy to come up with stuff on the spot such as stating enemies and stuff. 




 Nobilis
chuck the "estates" away if nevessary. 




 my main worry is that the characters will feel very much the same power wise by having the same abilities and such,Nobilis each character had a diferent Estate and that helped keep them apart, amber only had Pattern,Logrus,Shape-shifting (which seems very underpowered),Trump and Magic(all three) which sounds like the players would know what to expect. 
























 Yes i had the same idea to have trouble while passing by in earth dawn the gate spell had a strong spirit guarding it that was better to run by then defeat the same could apply to this but things that you run into while reaching your destination.

I mean shape change as in metagamic kind of thing shapeshift into a sentient puddle or turn your fist intl solid metal and stuff of thr like the same i have thougbt about the character loosing his sense of identity nothing like trying to change sex and critical glitch i would maybe make it so when you glitch either the spell warps or you are stuck with what you tried to change into for a while even alien hand syndrome if applicable.
I'm typing all of this on my phone so sorry for the grammar. 




 I thought about that maybe if the character was an older infected that took his training seriously would have to train for how many mny years i know harlequin did but when it comes to immortal elves well...im not that well versed on them snd people tell me to just ignor that 




 For Teleport i had the idea for the mage to shift to astral space and get materialize in another place maybe available at high initiation maybe 7-9?

Shapshifting also more than shapechange i'm talking body parts and such.

and finally phasing turn etheral for a moment just dematerializing like a spirit would.

post how would you make them not broken. 




 spells that you created and found it really useful. 




 Well apart from the fluff and character

I see most people that understand a bit about min-maxing actually go for mages

what i feel is that they try to make magic so balanced it looses the element of "magic" of it.

and i think that's a debate that's going for a long time chrome vs mana

which i am not the person to answer it but this thread would be enlightning 




 As a magic character what was the biggest magical feat you have performed and how did it turn out? 




 Thanks i missed that. 




 Assuming that they keep feeding regularly.
since vampires of old were considered ageless if they kept feeding.
didn't find anything on that. 




 Heavily magic character lacking in alot of other things to boost magic and might be infected with hmhvv while also being very frail so i thought of elric and though that stormbringer would be a nice addition and perhaps be a possible plot point for the gm 




 Am is readind this right? A mage that follows a tradition wich dosent have water spirits cannot summon such a type? What a bummer what about shedim and such i know some mages can summon them or did i misread that too? 
























 Was thinking more of castlevania and Dark tower but that fits it somehow aswell 




 Makes sense

I understood whar you said i just added a few points. 




 So how do we know what's cannon?

Also why would harlequin declare a blood feud with Dunkz even if he had killed dupree by accident which i don't think Ghostwalker did, I highly doubt dunkz would've taken control over denver the way he did. 




 Thought that he was just his brother i remember dunkz's spirit being in a cyberzombie. 




 
The PCs are hired to secure the area inside tir na nog's veil rumors and reports of a manastorm on the rise are circulating about for a while.

big events does the awakened community speculate on the matrix,  the manastorm did come about altough unexpectingly on it's way to the veil, despite the PCs best efforts the two anomalies crash and the PCs are shot up into a deep metaplane waking up in a completly destroyed tir na nog with remnants of the city and a gigantic ancient sky scraper with a strange architecture showing signs of "life".

The PCs would climb up the tower and there would encounter all types of surrealistic places in each floor of the Building hoping that they would reach the summing before going insane.

I thought it'd be a nice break from the usual Shadowrunning is to be done and give the players the feeling that magic isn't actually as "predictable" as science like some feel.

give me your opinions and thoughts, please- 




 One where i can play as a mage. tell me what was your experience with it. 




 I'm open to new systems , those are just the ones i know a bit and have the books of. 




 Much apreciated i'l take a look at it. 




 i think it's kind of a bummer to be limited to the ones they give us and i'm not confident enough to create them without rules, i suck at balancing stuff. 




 Gimme some examples of the ones that are already available?
Hmm actually could i reflavor improve attribute to have the visual aspect i want?

Thats actually a new question i guess is it acceptable to have the magician manifest spells the way he wants visually? Dont remeber reading anything like that in 4e or 5e 
























 i've heard of special astral gates that let meat go into astral and corps hid their existence and protected them heavily outside and inside.

i've seen some stuff from 4th age about magic it isn't that far from sixth with few obvious examples otherwise pretty much of it sounds like things peopel just haven't thought about it or have the materials and critters available

blood magic is especially brutal most things leave you disfigured and such. 




 If it's knowledge dragons supposedly might also be able to do it, right? Assuming it isn't a "secret technique" of the 4th age 




 I'm talking like Great dragon magic, mass blood rituals, VERY powerful spirits and ETC at what point could a spirit start showing signs of higher magicks (probability manipulation or true resurrection ) things that most certainly would not be possible for a pc in normal play.

please no "handwave it" type of responses, it's just for speculations and debates sake.

here's a good one too what would your "Perfect" scenario for a ritual and i mean bringing everything you know ,ley lines,feng shui etc. 




 Yeah it's just that feeling you get when see someone's elses thought on how he looked. 




 I don't wanna explain too much bcause it might go against lore and have it all go down the drain.

On the other hand it's a metaplane

yeah i'l just introduce some more people maybe some animals that were also caught in the blast and they'le meet while climbing the tower

"I haven't seen the tower light up in a long time" could the spirit say.

how do we get out?

"if you want to technobabble talk to the one who's in charge of it" 




 Woah is that really how he's depicted? 




 Nobilis you are lord and embodiment of an aspect of reality. 




 well the point of the of a manastorm hitting the veil is to cause a big magic event, it's supposed to be magic but you can always drop hints for it to be something more

Only one way to know,climb the tower.

i had the free spirit idea but then i thought "they're nowhere why would they? but i'l let some metaplane "citizens" there to drop some hints and chat.

it's a deep metaplane , who knows if deep enough they are or sometimes are the same thing?

In the end i hope th gm left enough hints for the players to make up their own explanation usually that is way more interesting then what you had planned.

but anyway thanks for the suggestions! 




 Okay i summon a spirit how do i know what the spirit can do?

basicly walk me through spirits in Mage: The Ascension 




 Please read the whole conversation. 
























 If not, Where would i start reading from? 




 Yes,Yes,YES! 




 How do you do it? 




 Rinoha(ff8) could be a princess of let's say Spades
Since in the games Leon (Squall ff8) implies that Rinoha is either dead or somewhere "far-away".

Tiana(Princess and the frog) Spades

...and maybe remove attributes(they aren't very well defined) just fill it with random princesses 




 Can animals become gods?

does eating a soul rejuvenates the body

and kudos for having easy to come up with enemies if what you told is correct.

Could you explain more about the event of a god abandoning his humanity (Going full-time god) what happens? 




 Could you explain entitlements? How p can they be? And are there minions and such and could an army be considered one minion since none of the soldier alone are special?
After 100 hundred years do the gods start aging again or do they just become "killable"
How fast can a gm come up with another god on the spot? 




 Well how crazy can things get? Power level wise can i make kusanagi's sword? It can cut everything.

How do the charactee feel do they all feel the same wheb playing? 




  Pretty much what's in the title remakes and stuff are also welcome but please tell me if there are differences from the original, thanks in advance.

oops so sorry 




 Pretty much what's in the title
remakes and stuff are also welcome but please tell me if there are differences from the original, thanks in advance. 




 If so, what was you experience with it?

it looks kind of like nobilis but more streamlined and less "confusing" 





























 ayy lmao 




 Godlike, 
superheros manifest during WW2 it has a chronology with dates and  events.

The first one was a german flier who Hitler hugged and declared the first Aryan. 




 Nooo :'C 




 No :C 









  Perfectly normal, perfectly healthy.

aha! 




 I sadly have to agree, it's one of the reasons i am afraid to say i'm a Portuguese player.

I think it's because they still haven't left that "roleplaying-phase" we all had, where the first characters everyone usually made were terrible anime cliches or bland copies of other media.

We all leave that phase but it has to be by our own accord, can't force it and you can't ask your weaboo friends to help you because showing up at a dnd table with Sasuchigo the demon shinigami who's destiny is to save the world and then get mad when people when they try to explain how things work and how they don't.

(this has happened to me some times it does not end well)

i could go on to explain in more detail but i don't wanna fill this thing up without good reason. 




  Perfectly normal, perfectly healthy.

What does that mean? 




 To hit things better, than the others.

Every class can try to do everything but is only an expert at a certain area.
 




 Portugal has a very small community mostly Dnd, pathfinder(Implying it's not dnd) and V:TM.

I have seen one rpg that was made by Portuguese people and it's about children who were commissioned by death to rapture souls of other people in turn for a chance at heaven i believe.
It's darker than it sounds. 




 How does a human turned statistic look like? 




 It would've saved uncle Ben. (i'm sorry)

maybe not as a full-on spandex superhero more of a casual person with a strange ability AND it'd be a great way to get to know people
OOPS the elevator stopped when that special person came in. 




 The weirdest superpowers you would like to have

 and how you would use it.

1 power per post(not person),please. 




 Thnks. 




 I remember the character was a demon who was given to human parents to raise, when he grew up the demons came back to take him, as a teenager he's flung onto a wall by a car leaving the mark of a demon on the wall.

it's an old anime
