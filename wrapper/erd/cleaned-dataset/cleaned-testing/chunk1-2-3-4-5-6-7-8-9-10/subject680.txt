 The man is a genius. He just plays stupid, so people like him more.  Everyone loves a fool.  




 Say that to their face. Let someone record it first... 




 Did someone really get paid to "find" this?   




 I wouldn't know.  I missed it, for a reason.  




 Fuck you.  Littering is never Ok.  




 Of course it matters.  




 My vote is on asshole trolls from outer space.  




 Not if they have a dash cam or someone else is a witness to you breaking for no reason.  




 Fuck you and everyone that cares for you. You're what's wrong with the roads.  




 Are you a cop? No, then fuck off out of the left lane.  




 Yes.  Rules of the road.  




 I am so happy right now.  




 Is it that horrible to live there?  




 I can't decide if this is a good thing, or a fucked up country.  




 I came here to say this, about.  +1 




 Are you passing someone? No? Then you shouldn't be in the left lane!  




 Don't be in the left lane in the first place then!  




 GET OUT OF THE LEFT LANE THEN!!  He's not the tailgating asshole, you're just an asshole!  




 I had two girls want to make that deal with me, after I asked them out.  All I heard was "you're to ugly and not rich enough yet, but if you look me up when you're rich..." 




 You ARE an asshat.  No justification.  




 Point is, this guy was a negligent ass.  No one should have to handle this due to a "mechanic" who knew about it!  




 You're a careless, thoughtless, asshole.  I wish bad things on you.  You said you knew and let it go. Fuck you. Fuck your family. And fuck you again.  




 I have but one up vote to give.  




 So, I was half right?  




 No, no you can't. Not only would the elections take forever to dry out, but it's the rest of the car that is really fucked.  Mold in the seats, mold in the doors, rust everywhere.  Water gets into places it was never meant to be and doesn't have a way out.  That's why insurance companies always total flooded cars.  




 I thought you could only legally make and sell porn in California and Florida..? 




 I don't know what you did, but I assume you drive like an idiot.  I'd have to be furious to throw food.  




 My wife is a horrible cook, but she at least knows and admits it.  




 I'd go off on that bitch.  Touch my food and we have issues.  




 That IS common knowledge.  




 I showed this to my wife. She's really mad.  




 Fuck that guy.  




 Nice try, NSA. 




 I hate that he said that do much, I almost down voted you, for typing it.  What an ass.  




 Except for the fact that you have an a/c leak that isn't going to be fixed with a can... 




 Thank the diy ac recharge kits.  




 I'm not sold on the fiesta.  There is a rather large selection of after market performance upgrades for the focus st and several message boards dedicated to enthusiasts.  




 I have 2014 focus ST and I love it more than any car I've had before.  Fun, fast, and great as a daily driver.  




 This times a thousand. Traffic engineer people.  Listen.  




 Try speeding up then.  




 One car length. If you leave more than one car length between you and the car in front, I will take that spot.  Keep up with the flow of traffic people.  




 Best. Job. Ever. 




 Where are you supposed to put your beer then?  In some secret fridge?  Asshat 




 Sold meth at a rave.  




 And that kids, is how I met your mother. 




 What about the traffic jam that people cause by stopping in the road, as opposed to pulling off? Example, on a normal four lane street (two going each way), a person stopping in the street blocks off one lane and backs traffic up for miles (sometimes during rush hour).  Why don't people driver up another 100 yards to a parking lot or side street? 




 Kind of a sucker punch, but that guy deserved it!

DAMN, YOU GOT KNOCKED THE FUCK OUT! 




 That's do dumb it gets fooled by decoys.

do dumb

DO DUMB? 




 Were you high on pot or LSD? 




 I guess I forgot to finish reading.  My bad. 




 If I was in this situation, I would go to his house, talk to his parents, find out when he will be home and give him one chance to make with the photos.  Digital copies before I went anywhere/let him out of my sight.  I would not directly threaten physical violence, but he would be able to tell from the look on my face that his well being currently in jeopardy.

Sometimes an ass kicking or threat of ass kicking is the quickest solution to a problem. 




 Not going to tell what the sub reddit is..? 




 Do you know where he lives?  Pay him a visit. 
























 That knife is worth more than $20... 




 Should of had a better best man.  




 Watch TV, golf, and eat out all the time. Oh, we both have new cars.  




 THIS MAKES ME SO ANGRY!  




 I'm now survivor ready.  




 Robin.  Sorry.  




 I was waiting for her to throw or drop it, to show how easily damaged our brain is.  I was disappointed.  




 Batman and Robin.  Batman Forever was bad enough to demand a reboot, but the pushed it one more time.  Batman and Robyn will be forever known to me as the worst movie ever.  




 Blow jobs 




 I find it hard to feel sorry for people who made millions then blew it all.  




 Women drivers  




 This is what i tell my wife all the time.  That and the speech from Team America World Police.  There are three types of people in the world; dicks, pussys, and assholes.  I'm a dick and i feel responsible to fuck assholes who think it's on to shit on you pussys.

She doesn't agree, but it's been 5 years, so i think she's at least accepted.  




 What is wrong with you?  Do you only like happy cartoons?  




 Leaving Las Vegas  




 Did i miss the funny?  




 The kid was a dumb thug.  The cops testimony isn't that hard to believe.  The evidence backs it up.  Blood in the cop car, kid shot at close range.  




 So, what about people that aren't homeless or in prison?  Is there a genetic predisposition to being gay, but there needs to be the triggers in your life?  Similar to people that suffer from addiction?  I've always figured everything in life is a mix of nurture AND nature.  




 I've always thought this was more the case with gay men.  Of course some women become lesbians, even gay men think women are attractive. It's sex with them that scares them.  




 So by that logic, a person who is constantly scorned by the opposite sex, and accepted by their sex, could develop long term "gay" feelings and behaviors?   




 I got an idea.  Everyone there hates the police, so the police should just leave.  Let the towns people protect themselves.  




 One study last week said it proved it was genetics, now this study is suggesting it's a learned behavior.  Nurture vs. Nature rages on.  




 Never worked in a shop?  Oil and air.  




 A beautiful American history lesson from JizzBomb. 









 Literally, unbelievable.  




 Fuck that lady.  I'll drive slow in the left lane, be reckless and film the guy I'm blocking, then laugh when he crashes because I've forced him to speed past my self righteous ass.  




 Fuck more women 




 This should be at the top of the list! 




 This man is my new hero.  




 Did he take the charger? 




 ITT: no shit  




 Police don't just show up and start harassing people.  Something had to draw their attention to said person. If that person then was polite, respectful, and didn't question authority and act like they know the law/their rights, then unless you are breaking the law, the cop will go away.   I've always been polite and respectful, and i always walk away.  My friends tend to mouth off and make sudden movements, and end up in jail. 

Is it right?  Fuck no.  Fuck the police, their agenda, and their corporate masters.  But, i like my "freedom", so when i see a cop, i do my best to be John Q. Public Taxpayer,  and i suggest you do the same.  




 Yes, fuck you.  Safe distance is half a car length, at any speed.  




 Why would we want to buy a tank from the French anyways?  Maybe we were being polite...  Look France, it's not your tank, it's us. We just don't understand, but thanks anyways.  




 These are all mostly designed as a one time use part.   




 Your suspension components.   But sure, drive that thing in, techs need to eat too.  




 Women drivers 




 False.  Porsche 356 pre A. 




 I was once told, you may be able to buy a used Mercedes, but you can't afford to maintain one.  




 Funny, i feel the same.  What's even more funny is i always considered Daft Punk to be an EDM type "band". 




 My wife votes Democrat, and i vote Republican, so now we both save time and neither of us vote.  




 How exactly does one, suck a fuck?  




 Bad luck Brian.  Turns found gun over to the police.  Gets arrested when gun comes back tied to a double homicide. 

Remember,  possession is 9/10 of the law and police don't care who did it, as long as they can arrest someone.  Hopefully it won't be you.  




 This is why 4, 5, and 6 are far better than 1, 2, and 3.   If you take that much time on the models and special effects, you're going to put as much effort into the story and charters.  1, 2, and 3 were beautiful c.g.i. effects, but had no depth beyond that.  




 What does something that happened a hundred years ago have to do with a guy getting jumped by three black guys?  




 Roland 




 Holy shit, i live within 15 miles of there!  I'll be visiting soon.  




 That's the problem.  Engines and oil are getting better, so they tell people that you can go longer in between oil changes, but we still use paper filters.  I don't like going past 5k.  




 No, it's still bitching and he still sounds like a dick. 




 This. I've interviewed close to 50 people and it bugs the shit out of me when they are half an hour early.  I feel that is worse than 5 minutes late.  I'm a busy guy and I gave you the appointment time for a reason.  Last guy showed up while I was still eating my lunch.  =/ 




 Worst. Porn. Ever. 




 Well, that's disappointing.  




 Problem is, too many people drive like thoughtless idiots, so they walk the same.  
























 Grind and polish it down, then engrave. 




 Did you eat the bastard?  




 Comcast.  I don't care if they have a "monopoly", shouldn't the government or some other company come in with a takeover?  




 Now that's something a five year old can understand!  




 Looks like OP got it wrong.  




 I was going to reply that all men want blow jobs for Valentines Day, but this answer is much better  




 I live in a suburb of Chicago, and our plow drives don't give two shits. They have a schedule to keep and they aren't slowing down to give our driveways a break.  Slightly different subject, but I've seen cars that are under tons of packed snow, slush, and ice.  




 This.  I already clear my drive way to the right (flow of traffic) and part of the road (so i can get in and out of the driveway), but my driveway is always full of snow again when the plow comes through.  




 The problem is some people CAN'T get vaccinated, due to being too young, too sick with something else, or allergic.  It's the people that CHOOSE that are putting the people that CAN'T in danger.  




 That's the point of getting vacancies, so you don't get said diseases.   




 Do you want to drive in the road with uninsured drivers?  




 I don't know why, but the last line made me genuinely laugh out loud.  




 The other day = within the last year 




 I like how the show seems to be taking a slightly different path than the books.  




 Do you want spoilers? Because that is how you get spoilers.  




 If you think that really fixed your problem, you're going to have a bad time.  




 Shut down or not, the core needs a constant supply of water to keep it cool.  No water being pumped in, the core will overheat and meltdown.  Source - Life After People.  




 Nuclear power plant melt down.  Without constant maintenance, every single one of those plants are ticking time bombs.  




 I hope you fall deeply in love, then get cheated on, and catch an STD.    




 Drugs are bag, mkay. 




 When i delivered pizza I did that shit all the time.  




 No, fuck you.  




 My wife got a $400 dye job and hair cut, so I got a $400 putter.  




 Looks painful. But why is he smiling?  




 All that, and in the end, i would say it was a failed attempt.  I want my six and a half minutes back.  




 Why doesn't Bob get fired for stealing in both cases?  




 Lots of people don't know that it's then coolant that also provides the heat.  If your coolant isn't good, neither is the heat.  




 An O2 sensor is a pretty hardy device, and they don't go bad that often. If you're getting a bad signal from the O2 sensor, it means you have an emissions problem.  Changing the sensor isn't going to fix anything.  




 I always tell people, a bad signal doesn't mean a bad O2 sensor. 




 Chicago land? We could use a second.  




 I see a cartoon old fashion steam train. 




 I always wonder how people this dumb survived on their own.  




 I told my wife that i jerk off once a day (at least), if she doesn't want me to masterbate then she should do something about it everyday, if not, live with it.  




 Eat some and find out. 




 I was a little sick, and taking a piss when i felt a fart coming on... 




 I'd watch it.  




 Bush haters don't want to hear this.  




 I thought the people didn't have Internet.  So what does the government care if they use up all the bandwidth?  




 Not fancy, ST.  It's the sport addition, part of the old SVT racing team.  




 You don't know anything about the ST, do you?  




 The Focus ST comes with these seats, so why not get a matching baby seat.  




 How else do you brine a whole pig?  




 Yeah, but he got kicked out of the band for doing too much LSD. 




 Fuck you. That is all.  




 Love that movie.  I use that quote all the time irl, and no one gets it.  




 Very dangerous if you're driving around with munitions strapped to the top of your boat... 




 Do you want hate mail? This is how you get hate mail.  




 Just because it's legal, doesn't mean it's Ok.  




 What do you mean, "if"? They clearly are.  




 Who cares what the guy wants, some chick wants to fuck.  




 What state? I want to make a note to avoid that and all the states that touch that state. And maybe the ones that touch those... 




 How is this person still alive? I'm picturing a person who can't figure out how to get food in their mouth.   




 Pcp is a hell of a drug.  
























 AWD = all wheel drive, which is all the wheels turning at the same time.  They're all driven off the same engine and same
 transfer case.  Now that you know that, here is the second part...  Different sized tires on one car, have to spin at different RPM's in order to turn at the same speed.  Add those together and you have a problem for transfer cases. 




 Ironic that it wasn't eating...  seems like he was playing the long game to get a taste of human.  




 Doesn't matter, got arm back.  




 That, actually makes a lot of sense.  




 It being made by EA. 




 I don't know how to do a spoiler tag.  But you can't believe everything to hear or read.  




 You shut your dirty mouth, with that jumped the shark nonsense!  




 Please explain this guys problem then... 




 I had an argument with someone on here, and they swore there was noting in meth that harms you or destroys teeth, that it was poor hygiene.   Some people are idiots.    




 I don't care how much EA sucks, I'm going to give them my money!  




 I wouldn't go.  




 The rich hide and move their money to avoid this tax anyways. That's what trust funds and lots of foundations are all about.  Now they don't have to do this.  If this hurts anyone, it's going to hurt all the tax and estate lawyers. 




 Yeah, I would now encourage my kids to make as much noise as possible, and save that letter to show the police when they show up. I would then ask them to file a harassment charge on said "neighbor".  God save said person if they decided to not call the police and try to confront my kids themselves.  I'll be the first one to give someone a dirty look if their kids are acting up in public when it's not appropriate, but I'll be dead in the grave before someone tells me how to act in my own god dammed yard!  




 I would go outside and make as much noise as possible, during daylight hours.  Fuck that person.  




 Then why doesn't it dissolve sugar?  




 So gas will dissolve Styrofoam, but not sugar?  




 If you don't mind, I'm just gong to slowly masterbate.  




 Fall out, i killed everyone.  




 Third time?  Filthy casual.   




 I don't start shit, but if you hit me, I'm going to finish it. Period. 




 How about you just move over to the right?  




 This cop would of be justified in shooting that uppity bitch.  




 Las Vegas.  Hover damn will give us easy power.  




 Better question, why do you walk so slow and in my way?  Make way for the tallest, peasants!  




 I remember when this was a thing.  




 No mention of Dag's?  




 I've always thought that people that get drugged are completely out of it.  As in, she wouldn't of gotten into her vehicle and gotten in the freeway.  




 Even if she wasn't drunk or on illegal drugs, it is illegal it sleep in the middle of the freeway then refuse a police order to "stop". 




 I pick a different spot  




 Photoshop or perspective?  




 How does he think his "zero emission" vehicles get recharged?  Most of the power in America comes from coal fired plants.  




 Be more confident, pick up on the signs from the girls, and have sex with them all.  




 You evil bastard.  




 Right or wrong, when a person with a gun tells you to "get down", you listen and show them your best dance moves.  Don't be shy, it could cost you your life.  




 Ok dude...  you're clearly a fucking jackass.  If you think meth isn't dangerous, and all the people dying from that shit is because they don't take care of themselves, then I'm not going to keep arguing.  Like I was told years ago, never argue with an idiot.  And I'll take all the down votes.  Clearly redit is a bunch of loopy liberals who will believe anything.  




 You smoked for a few years.  Good for you, you got lucky, so far.  I'll bet money that you'll have health problems in the future.   If you would of kept using, you would of developed issues.  I had a good friend who used for years.  He was a super clean freak, showered, shaved,  brushed his teeth and everything, but his teeth were bad and getting worse, he was always breaking out in sores, and he eventually blew his brains out.  The shit some pharmaceutical company makes in a lab is NOTHING like street meth.  Nothing. If you think it is, then go back to doing meth, and check in with me in 10 years, if you can.  Meth will destroy your internal organs too. Can't blame that on poor hygiene.   




 Are you an idiot or in denial?  Meth will eat away every part of your body that it touches.  Why do you think peoples teeth fall out? Why do you think doing meth for 10 years ages people 30+ years?  And don't give me any shit about how it's all the bad shit they put in meth to cut it.  There isn't really such a thing as pure meth that anyone on the street is going to find.  




 It has nothing to do with skin color, it's the culture.  




 You sure do have a lot of free time on your hands.  




 That girl looks a little young.  




 Who?  




 Three.  Shouldn't it be "an"?  




 The correct response "I'll fix it for free and give you money!" 




 Hornets and spiders 




 Friends come and go, doesn't matter, had sex.   




 Sorry, but that's not how it works.  Wing man breaks the ice.  If you can't close the deal or the female chooses the wing man, then you're SOL.  Try looking in the mirror before blaming others for your issues.  




 Any woman can get laid anytime they want. Just find a horny and desperate man.  

But can a woman land a guy that's better looking, with her personality, the way men can?  Usually not. 

But I've seen plenty of people hooking up at closing time, that would never be with said person in another situation.  Late night and alcohol can do wonders for everyone.  




 I'm only going to break the ice, if you can't close the deal, you don't need a wingman, you need a hooker.  




 Bull.  I'm not a pretty man, but I've had plenty of one night stands, where I get the girl with my humor and wit.  Make them laugh and your golden.  




 If you can't close the deal, why should he have to miss out on some strange? Grow a pair.  




 Are you God or the police? No.  Then get off your high horse and out of the left lane.  




 STAY IN THE RIGHT LANE THEN, NOT SORRY.  




 Ever consider not being in that lane in the first place.  You slow passive drives need to just say in the right lane.  
























 I want!   I love my ST and will probably hold on to it for a few more years, so I hope the RS sticks around long enough for me to pick one up.  




 Take lessons.  Take lessons with someone that users a video camera.  I did and it was the best money I've spent on golf.  




 I actually really like it.  It keeps things new and fresh.  Plus we won't have to wait for him to (maybe) finish the books. 

It's similar to The Walking Dead, in how things are the same but different.  









 I'll probably go stage 3 Cobb, with their standard tune.  Seems like it is safe enough, from what I've tag on all the messages boards.  




 I agree.  My backseat is just an extended trunk.  I've had two single passengers back there, and it's good for them on their own, but if I had 4 people to haul, unless they were 10 or younger, I'd tell them to take a different car.   I love my ST, but I see it as a two adult, and a couple of kids, car.  Not 5 adults.  




 The aftermarket for these cars is pretty big too.  I'm waiting as long as I can (warranty) before I start to tinker with it...  I know I won't be able to hold out for the whole life of the warranty, but if I make it another year, I'll be good to go.  




 I love my ST. 




 I have a Focus ST, and love it.  Have fun!  




 Buy cars and car parts, for restoration.  




 It's a man thing.  Even men who have no idea how to work on cars, are naturally drawn to an open hood.  Doesn't really matter that it's s woman that opened it, all the man sees is an open hood.  Once they get there, they might realize that you're a woman and turn up the bullshit and creepy meter, but it was the open hood that first brought them over.  




 I'm anti government, and pro individual rights, but I'd fully support this in my neighborhood.  I do me, and you do you, as long as your thing doesn't interfere with my thing.  When it does is when we need government, and there's too many people walking their dogs and not picking up after them.  




 Go home, you're drunk.  




 Raising Arizona.   15 min into the movie before the opening credits start . 




 Don't get drunk and pass out around strangers.  Take off your shoes and go to sleep like a civilized person, asshat. 




 Did he pass out with his shoes on? Our rule was, pass out with your shoes on and you get "tagged", take them of and you're safe till you wake up.  




 No one's asking you to like old cars or engines.  Please take your opinion place else and quit trying to kill other people's buzz.  




 I would also think that as part of the interview and hiring process, they would point out the fact that the big man in black can kill you, so not to back talk him.  




 I thought I've heard that most pedophiles were sexually abused as children.  If that's the case, then it has nothing to do with how they were born, but how they were raised.  




 People who say/think, that violence is never the answer, don't realize that in cases like this, an ass beating goes a long way.  Either you get your money back, or you feel better because you just taught someone a life lesson.  




 My wife has an auto immune disease that attacks her joints (among other things). She can walk normally, but always in pain.  She doesn't show it and people give her shit all the time.  Never when I'm around.  The other day a fucking cop gave her a hard time and accused her of using someone else's window placard. 




 Alcohol  




 Yes. Life is harsh.  Don't do stupid shit, or something bad might happen to you.  Pissing of the wrong person, who knows their rights in the eyes of the law, just might be one of those bad things.  




 Ok, per street rules then.  Touch me and expect it back. Step on me, and I'll put you on the floor.  Or are you suggesting that hoodie should have just smiled and carefully moved to another desk?  




 The defense is this: I was being bullied, taunted, and harassed, then in my interpretation at the time, was attacked from behind, so I defended myself.  In fact, the whole thing got caught on tape.  Oh, she was just stepping onto the desk I was sitting at? Ok, I still defended myself.  No body has the right to decide to climb on me, without my permission.  That's the defense.  Seems pretty straight forward.  




 Point being, personal space is personal.  You breach that space uninvited at your own risk.   




 Being "attacked" by legal standards is 100% subjective.  If you poke me, and I feel threatened, I'm justified in defending myself.  




 Anyone who says they had the best days of their life in high school, I just feel sorry for.  How sad to think that someone can peek at such a young age, then have it all downhill from there.  




 If you touch me in a way that makes me feel threatened, I have the legal right to defend myself.  




 The person in the hoodie got stepped on, the girl fell when hoodie moved.  And fuck that, step over me in any situation, and I'll put you on your ass.  In that situation, I was assaulted first and I defended myself.  The law is on my side, you touch me in a way that makes me feel threatened, I have the right to defend myself.  




 More movies than, what?   And I've watched plenty of movies.  Not saying those are the two best movies, just two of the best endings.  If you disagree, please feel free to let me know which endings you think are better.  And if you say "The Usual Suspects" or "The Sixth Sense", or any other movie that ends in a twist, then I'll call you a cheater. ;-)  




 But how do you know that you didn't just save the bad guy?  Maybe he was part of their group and turned on them, and you just stopped some justified mob justice?  




 Try to justify it all you want, but look at your vote counter.  Your wrong and there isn't anything you can say to change that. Asshat. 




 Needs more fire.  




 Two great endings.  




 I'm 80% sure, if not, it's the second to last.  But yeah, it's the end of the film.  




 I love that movie, and that is the best part of the whole film.  Probably the best ending of any movie, next to seven. 




 Yeah, fuck that.  I'm going in.  Say shit and I'm calling the cops.  Rule of thumb, person who calls first gets the best treatment from the cops.  




 I realized how dumb I was, right after clicking "send". 




 If you're getting passed in the right lane, you're breaking the law.  Dick.  




 But if they're speaking, how is he able to tell the difference?  




 Are those like the Lincolns from the 90's?  You got to turn those off or they'll blow.  




 When ever I get asked to go to a strip club, I ask them if they want to go to an all you can eat buffet, but you can't actually eat anything...   




 It's almost like revolutionary is related to evolutionary... 




 My parents *pretty much* know.  The aunts and uncles though... 




 *smacks you with a rolled up newspaper* No! 




 Dude, you're the freaking problem.  




 It's like a grown up Highlights magazine.  Can you name them all?  80's hoopty ride in the back round, cigarettes tucked into the bra, sandals over socks, cheep domestic beer... 




 We used to have Hulu, then we upgraded to plus.  I then told my wife that I'm not paying go watch commercials.  Netflix it is.  




 Yes 




 If it is designed to have different sizes, then it's Ok.  If the engineers want something, they can pre-plan for it.  




 Correct.  Width doesn't matter (that i know of). It's all about making sure each tire travels the same distance as the others.   




 Keep with that theory, and check the organ donor box on your driver license, so at least one life will be saved... 
























 I mean, it's no Hellcat, but I'm looking forward to getting one.  




 Let's not forget the upcoming Focus RS. 




 TIL: Your dad and brother are dummies.  




 lol, too easy?  Drunbs Dread?  The pro's cried so much about how hard it was, they haven't been back.  After playing there for years and years, they made some renovations to make it harder, and the pros didn't want to play there anymore.  




 Anyone that drives a BMW.  What the fuck is wrong with you knob gobblers?! 




 I always told my employees to give the customer one warning about abusive language, after that to terminate the call.  Any manager or boss that allows a customer to verbally abuse their employees is (from what I've been told)breaking the law also.  Employees do not have to put up with a hostile work environment.  




 Well, let's just say I won't hold my breath waiting for the PGA Tour to come back to Cog Hill.  




 No, I  get that.  The US open is at different locations all the time, and they go back to some of them (pebble beach), but I'm willing to bet that if this course plays as hard as it could, they'll never be back.  




 That's a good deal.  They giving you swag too? How about a round of golf?  I got a windbreaker and a free round.  So it worked out.  




 I volunteered at the BMW Championship, the last year it was at Cog Hill, and it cost me $150.  I thought it was worth it...  did you have to pay?  




 The pro's all cried about cog hill, and now they'll never be back there.  I'm guessing next year's open will be at some favored course again.  




 You're the one with reading and comprehension issues.  The masters is in charge of the masters!  




 You really don't understand how the PGA tour works, do you?  




 What part of private tournament are you having problems understanding?  




 Sounds like a neckbeard was trying to hit on you.  




 Even if the PGA didn't consider it a recognized tournament, it doesn't change the fact that it's a private event, held by a private club.  The money is what brings the players, not the PGA. 




 It's a private tournament on a private golf course.  Don't like it? Then organize a protest and try to stop it.  There is no sanctioning body to "correct" them.  




 It's a private tournament, with a big cash prize.  No one can stop it.  




 Stupid people shouldn't piss me off as much as they do, I mean, it's not their fault.  But stupid people really piss me off.  I'm glad to hear this story.  




 Wow.  Consider my mind changed.  I feel like I need to go and reread the books for a fourth time now... 




 The Ace?  You mean Mace?  And noooo, the man is a dunce.  Everything in the shows and books point this out.  




 At golfsmith, they usually do fittings for free, and they have clearance clubs for sale too.  




 Take lessons first.  The lessons might change your swing.  Then get fit for clubs.  It makes a difference, even for us high handicappers.  




 I just finished a set of lessons at golftec, and it's helped a ton.  Last year I was shooting in the high 90's, this year it's low 90's and I've shot an 88, 3 times.  I would find an instructor that used video.  




 My flop shot.  I see it like a gun.  I'd rather have it and not need it, than need it and not have it.  And if you're not careful with it, it can really hurt you or someone else.  I practice this shot 25% of the time on the range and use in maybe once every 3 rounds of play.  




 Check out the myprotogo app.  Frame by frame break down, and you can draw on screen.  It's free and it allows you to send the video in for tips (cost money). 




 No, the man is a dunce.  




 The show seems to have gone in so many different directions than the books, that I can't even being to guess what might happen next.  It's really cool!  




 I'd love to see or read that!  




 Damn, that's right.  And how many walked away?  2? 




 Lots of the head green keepers will have some dog or another.  




 This times a thousand.  In the books, they make this out to be one of the most epic battles of the whole war, and it happens at the end!  All the surviving bad asses from each side, squaring off. Was it 4 on 5 or 5 on 5? 




 I heard a saying once, "try to make something idiot proof, and God will just make a better idiot". 




 Read and play cards.  




 I know that, but I've also seen plenty of things that shouldn't work, but do. And things that should work, but don't.  I've worked in retail, management, food/service industry, product design/engineering, and in automotive repair and restoration.  I've seen some shit. 




 I practice my flop shot a ton.  But I see it like having a gun.  You hope you don't have to use it, but when you need it, it's a good thing to have.  




 I did and I've found it to be true.   




 Have more confidence and ask out more chicks.  




 Worst. Feature. Ever.  




 You can't put a square peg in a round hole, but you can put a round peg in a square hole.  




 There are no shortcuts.  




 She's a keeper.   Your girlfriend seems nice enough too... 




 This needs to be a top comment.  




 Take a drive out to the burbs.  Better courses, better value, and some of the Rangers care.  




 Reading this just made me so angry.  I hate "parents" like that.  I've found the best solution is to say something the very first time the child does something inappropriate.  And I don't say it to the kid, I turn to the parent and firmly say "do you mind controlling your child?  This action/ behavior is not allowed here for safety/insurance/privacy/corporate policy."  If they say shit or let it continue I call a manager over.  When I was a manager, this is what I trained people to say, and if I got called over, I informed them that if said behavior was not corrected, that they could take their business someplace else.  




 Correct sequence is where the lag comes from.  From the top, the swing should start with the feet, then legs, then hips, then shoulder, then arms, then last being the hands and club.  This is "lag", and is probably the hardest thing in golf to get right. 

Since the golf swing starts with the hands and arms in the backswing, it's hard for us amateurs to not start the downswing with the hands and arms too.  




 This is the most correct answer.  The giant club face helps, but also hurts, same as the long shaft.  Mistakes get compounded and amplified.   It's also part mental.  

You should try taking what feels like half a swing and a slower speed.  Just try to deliver the club face back square to the target. 




 My set up - 50 deg gap wedge, 54 sand, 58 lob.  Plus what ever deg the standard pitching wedge is, which comes before the gap.  




 The bounce matters more than the deg.  My 58 doesn't have any bounce, so I can open it up and use it for flop shots from the fairway.   I use my 54 that has bounce, and I just open the club face for short shots or leave it closed for longer ones.  




 Super bowl results.    




 Sex and golf.  




 Sweet story and all, and glad you had a little bright on your day...  And before I sound like a jerk, let me just say that I've worked all sorts of retail and food service, and I'm always polite, but COME ON.  You chit chatted 20 min away, while the line built up?   Nothing drives me more crazy than this.  Look, I'll smile and nod, but I got places I want to be, that aren't in line, waiting to give you my money.  Can you please make sure to just move the line along. 

Once again, sorry for being an ass, but I just want to pay for my shit and go, not listen to the two of you chat the day away.  




 It hasn't been an issue for me, but I'm not racing it on a track or doing many U turns... 
























 Thank you for that.  I just wish they could of gotten all the sound at the same levels.  And...that didn't really explain anything.  lol.  Do people think that the hound is still alive? Hoping for an epic battle between the two brothers?  




 lol, opps. No,  20k.  Big brain fart. 




 2014 ST2, $23K with 20k miles and no problems what so ever.  [Edit milage] 




 I love my ST2. I didn't want black leather, navigation, or a sunroof.   




 What is Cleganebowl?  I've read all the books and seen the shows, fyi.  




 Socks.  I bought a pair of the yellow toed ones by mistake and was surprised when they rang up for  $15 for 6 pairs, but said fuck it.  Been several months and they still feel new! No thinning, no loss of elastic, and no holes.  




 Yes you do.  A jack is not supposed to be used as a stand/support.  




 Even with the sound all the way up, I couldn't hear what he said... 




 Fuck that. I would of just called the police.  




 In the eyes of the law, strength has nothing to do with it.  She physically attacked him multiple times. Slapped and pushed.  He had every right to defend himself.  He didn't punch her, he didn't kick her, and he didn't choke her out, he held then threw her.  Man or woman, lay your hands on me, and I'll knock you the fuck out, then tell the police I feared for my life.  Guess who'll go to jail? It's on video? I promise, it won't be me.  




 Ok, sure.  But you can't filter the salt out of saltwater is the only point I'm making.  




 WHEN WILL THIS STOP BEING A THING?! 




 Ok, then sorry for "correcting" you.  




 What? Are you implying you were being sarcastic? Or you think I am?  I'm not.  




 You can't filter saltwater.  




 Speaking generally about filtering saltwater is a good way to die.  Drinking saltwater is no joke, and people need to be made aware how dumb the idea of just filtering it is, so they don't end up trying it in a survival situation.  




 Boiling tens of thousands of gallons of saltwater to make fresh water, is hardly what I would call "cost effective". 




 No.  Why waste good water?  If they have enough water to dilute the saltwater, then they wouldn't really have a water supply issue... 




 The salt is fully diffused into the water.  No amount of filtering will take the salt out.  It's like trying to filter the sugar out of sugar water.  Isn't going to happen.  




 You can't just filter salt water.  You'd have to boil set up some sort of distillation rig.  




 Dude, it's not that hard.  Make the tag, part of your pre swing ritual.  I line up behind the ball to look at what I'm going to do, and as I step into position, I click the butt of the club to my hip.  

His issues is no reason not to buy this.  I love my game golf and have zero issues with it.  




 Ha!  




 You're not having a positive impact!  Pull your head out of your ass! Someone is going to hurt someone, because of YOUR actions.  




 But that's my point, you're not saving anyone!  Speeders are just going to pass you on the right (endangering other), and possibly retaliate against you (endangering yourself and others).  So keep up the good work, dickhead! 




 And you trying to stop me from passing you isn't putting people's life in danger?  Your putting your own life in danger, idiot.  Go read a newspaper about how many people die in road rage incidents.  Keep up your attitude, and you're going to run into a real asshole, with a gun. Or just someone like me.  When I find people like you, I will pass you, and when I get in front of you, I'm going to slam on my brakes.  I've had people get rear ended, by the next guy that was trying to pass them.  Then I just drive on.  You trying to stop me from saving 5 min, could cost you hours.  Or worse.  Try to consider the mentality of the people you're trying to fuck with.  




 Then I'm going to pass you on the right.  You're not making the world a better place.  Why don't you grow up and stop thinking you can control other people?  




 You can tell yourself that, if it makes you feel better.  




 Then get ready to be passed on the right, then brake checked.  People like you are what cause people like me, to cause people like you to get into accidents.  I am an asshole and there are people worse than me on the roads.  Do you really want to provoke us?  Do so at your own risk.  Hopefully you don't drive around with your family.  




 And people die everyday from starving.  If but some shitty fast food or fuck up a meal in cooking, I'm throwing that shit out.  Don't try to guilt trip me out of speeding. 




 How about you quit cruising the passing lane?  




 I know it's illegal, and I take that risk and accept all responsibility for my actions.  That being said, get the fuck out of the way, please and thanks.  




 Are you the police?  Are you God?  If you're not either of those, then mind your own fucking business.  Don't  start shit, and I'll be in and out of your life in seconds.  




 Preach brother!  I wouldn't be passing in the right, if the ignorant masses weren't in the left!  I don't cut people off, if I pick the wrong lane and loose a few car lengths, I deal with it and pop into the next hole.  I'll pass the guy taking his time up there eventually.  




 I love when people forget to talk dollars and cents.  I drive a Ford Focus ST, and my dad has a tesla and asks if I want to race... 




 Don't ruin this... 




 I. Would. Die.  




 Sorry, not completely turn into them.  Just at the moment of impact, as I hold my lane and speed.  Of course I'd brake, but I'm not endangering others, but blindly changing lanes or going into the shoulder. There could be a bike or pedestrian I didn't see.  




 Fuel stabilizer. 




 If you can afford a BMW, you can afford to buy pre-made thread!  




 I got the gamegolf shot tracker. It doesn't track the official pga handicap because it doesn't take slope into account, but I like it.  I'm able to review my game, see where I need to spend the most time practicing, and it tracks my stats. 

I used to use mybogey.com.  Web site that does use slope, but since they are not affiliated with the pga, they can't say they give you an official handicap.  




 Local munis that are having problems, should open up the course to this game.  lol.  




 I read only 70%. 100% would be awesome.   




 I'm sorry, I thought this was justiceporn.  




 And that is why I started my whole point with stating that I don't know the laws in England...  But besides the house issue, go try to buy drugs, get robbed, and then call the police.  Let me know how that pans out.  




 I'm tired of dodging people who don't look.  Next guy that comes into my lane, I'm turning into them and letting them buy me a new car.  




 There's an old saying: you may be able to afford to buy a used Mercedes, but you can't afford to fix one.  




 So, if someone breaks into my house, I have to politely ask them to leave first?  No.  I shoot them and it's 100% legal. Same goes for store owners.  That man was committing a felony and the store owner stopped him.  It's wasn't "something he didn't like", it was a fucking crime.   You can't try to sell drugs, get robbed, then call the police to try to get your drugs or money back, just like you can't try to steal and get your ass kicked, then try to call the police.  Criminals have no recourse.  That is the whole reason the Mafia first came about.  




 I'm not sure about laws in England, but here in the states, it's perfectly legal to use force to stop someone from committing a crime.  There's an age old saying, criminals have no legal recourse.  




 It's a type of AWD. Not full time, used to gain traction, up to 70% can transfer to the rear and 100% to each wheel (or something like that). Plus it's the 2.3L with a turbo that will "put out well north of 315 hp".  Only manual transmission.  




 Teach me, please.  




 I bet that's a bad ass bat!  I want one, and then I want to start playing softball! 




 Years ago when I first started, I played a Yes!  I loved that putter.  But a putter isn't going to fix your putting.  Time will.  Putt on home on a rug to find your feel and stroke. Each day before golfing, you have to spend time on their putting greens to get a feel for their speed.  




 The hot deals are based on availability.  If they start booking a lot of times around that hot deal, then it comes off sale.   Kind of sucks, but it's not bait and switch.  That would be if you booked and paid for the hot deal, then they charged you the added amount later.  
























 Try lessons before ditching the clubs.  Lessons are cheaper that shelling out for new irons.  




 Where is that?  




 Similar but different...  There was a guy who was a hole behind us, but he was hitting out of our fairway, buy the green, only 150 yards away.  He was just standing there waiting for his fairway to clear or something, but he was holding us up, which was holding the guys behind us up, which was holding up his fairway...  5 minutes of us standing there yelling atamd signaling the guy, I finally hit into him (over and onto the green), and as we drive up he starts taking shit.  Closest I've ever come to kicking the shit out of someone on the course. 

When we pulled up he was like "what the fuck dude?!".  I was actually  polite at first and told him that he was in a group behind us and in our fairway, and to keep the pace of play, should of let us hit first.  His reply was "Fuck you", which is when I lost my cool and said "fuck me?! No, FUCK YOU!  Say one word and you'll catch an ass wooping, and I'll catch a case!"   Which is when he picked up his ball and walked away muttering something. 

So,  I know what it's like to lose my cool.  But when ever people hit into me, i just pick up their ball, show it to them, and throw it into the woods, water, or off into the rough.  




 Don't you wish. I own a 3 bedroom house in the burbs, have a very nice investment account, and am part owner of a successful company.  But tell yourself what ever you need to, to sleep well at night.   




 I think it's pretty great. 




 That's what makes America so great.  We're everything you want to be, and complete assholes about it.  Don't like it?  Then don't move here.  Doesn't bother me any.  




 I feel very safe, because I have police and the best military in the world, that put their lives on the line to keep me safe. And if that means killing any idiot that pulls a BB gun on two cops, then that's just fine with me.  




 And I'm saying, fuck everywhere else. This is America.  Pull a gun on anyone, cop or civilian, and that person has 100% right to out draw you and mow you down where you stand.  You become a threat, you get neutralized. Period.  Don't like it, then don't start shit, won't be shit.  




 I don't give a shit what other counties do. Here in America, police lives matter.  They put their lives on the line and have full right to put anyone down that threatens their lives.  




 Pace of play is set by group in front of you.  Failure to listen to a marshal can get you removed from the course.  




 These kinds of people are what give other enthusiasts a bad name.  




 They said in the video how bad the breaks were, yet they decided to speed through the neighborhood.  Down vote me all you want, but these kids give other enthusiasts a bad name.   




 Am I the only one that thinks these kids are dumb asses?  Why are they sinking money into that POS? And why are they driving it around when they know it has some major issues? 

If you want to tinker and tune, that's great, but don't take an unsafe, unregistered, uninsured, POS out on public roads. 




 I'd kill him.  




 I'd golf and work out.  Then I'd be the Cinderella story, of the guy who wasn't even an amateur golfer to come out of no where and qualify for the US Open, then go on to win every tournament and major, shattering every standing record. 

I'm a 15 handicap, but with 100 years of practice, I'm confident that I'd be the best in the world.  




 Sucess at begging?  Sure.  Success at running a company? No.  My company does 500,000 a month, all without KS and real customers.  




 I just threw up.  




 What type of company can't establish customers outside of KS? An unsuccessful one!  




 And that product can't be more than $2 in material. 




 Shouldn't they have put some money away from their last product launch for R D?  What type of company needs to raise funds every time they launch a new product? An unsuccessful one, that's what.  




 Why would a established company need kickstarter?   




 That kid is so dumb.  It's good to have dreams, but you have to be realistic.  Start with opening a small speed shop, and modify and tune cars.  




 Try building one car before you think you can start a whole company.  Do you have any idea how to even set up the PCM to run a fuel injection system?  How to tune it to get the best mpg and performance?  What about engine design? Do you even know the basics of engine math? 

Ford spends millions if not billions in R D. 




 Needs to be AWD, 600 hp, and get 50 mpg. 




 I agree. Wooden spoons taste like wood, not the ice cream.  




 Is Duvall still playing? I haven't heard about him in years.  




 Yes, you are reverse pivoting.  Think about pushing your hip to the left and you turn your left shoulder over your right knee. Once at the top, fire your right knee and hip, stand up, and drop your right shoulder.  




 What did I just read?  




 Yeah, not hurting the grass. If anything he's hurting himself, when that butt picks up all the fertilizer.  




 Nice! I love my ST. 




 Sounds like a first time manager who has let his limited power go to his head.  




 I have no idea.  lol 




 I've worked my game backwards, from green to tee.  Been playing 8 years now.  I started with pitching, chipping, and flop shots, but couldn't hit a long iron or driver to save my life.  I mostly focused on keeping my short game good and I shot in the upper 110's then slowly into the 90's. This winter I took some golftec lessons and focused on my irons, and in now shooting in the mid 80's to low 90's.  I want to jump into another set of lessons with my driver, but I don't want to push it too soon. But you're right, until I can find the fairway (or stay out of trouble) from the tee, I'll never be close to going as low as I want.  




 I got a golf outing with the family at the end of July in Grand Rapids. lol 




 I've read all the books and my brother is half way through the second and he keeps asking me questions.  I'm like, "Dude, do you really want me to answer that?".  lol 




 Sherman's March. I believe that's the name of a good book I've read.  




 In the books, she's not that far north, and Stanis was involved in a seige, with his whole army, and wife and child safe on the wall at another castle.  This story line has gone off the rails a bit.  




 It's not finished if he is still alive...  Broken and defeated men have still gone on to do great things.  




 I play on greens that don't look half that good and carry a 1.9 putting average.  




 After a year of playing I was still shooting in the 110-120's range.  After 7 years in now shooting in the low 90's - low 80's, depending on the course and how far my head is up my ass.  Lessons and time.  




 I worked at Firestone, the service writer recommends based on milage, I recommend based on what I see in the 13 point inspection.  I would check good, fair, bad.  I'd then show the customer the issue. I didn't hard sell anything.  




 It's ok.  A bit over priced.  My driving range is only 4 blocks from me, and they serve beer and have covered and heated bays.  But if you got a group of friends that aren't that good and want to golf, it's better to go to Top Golf, than a course.  




 Yes, but outdoors, but also covered. 




 To all the people saying the caddie doesn't matter...  How many tournaments and majors has Tiger won since he broke with his long time caddie?  Do you think Phil would give up his for anyone?  




 Driving range with targets and id chipped balls.  You play games, hit to specific targets, get points, and it tracks it all automatically.  Plus a full bar and bar food.  




 I wish this was higher. And I wish the National media/golf media would pick this up!   




 He sounds bi polar.  




 Well, I shot an 82 on Monday, and three 88's this season.  Shot in the 90's last season.  So I'm not great, not even good, but I'm improving.  Which is more than you're doing in life... 




 God, I wish.  At the very least I want to see that battle.  




 I agree.  You should fuck off.  




 No offense, but that's your problem.  Golf is NOT like riding a bike.  If you don't want to take lessons, at least buy a book and spend time at the range.  




 I knew about The Mountain, and totally forgot about the Isle.  Thanks!  




 Holy crap!  I remember these from my childhood! 
























 There's lots.  I'd suggest anything small batch and expensive ($40 +). 




 Not just whiskey, but GOOD bourbon.  




 Stay out of the well and you'll do yourself a favor.  




 Stop drinking cheap booze.  I'm 36 and started drinking good bourbon two years ago, and never have hangovers.  




 It's clear that 90% of the people in this thread have never worked in a auto shop.  




 lol

Ok, so was the guy trolling or serious?  




 If they have a good pace of play that is enforced, I'd join!  




 After a quick YouTube search. 

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=jBZOohlK4vU

Go on YouTube and watch and practice. 




 Like I said, that's all arms. He needs to swing with his shoulders.  




 Horrible angle. Should be straight on or straight behind, on an angle doesn't do much good. 

But lucky for your friend, his first flaw is really easy to see...

He's swinging with only his arms.  There was no hip or even shoulder rotation. He needs to form a triangle between his arms and shoulders and maintain that through the swing.  The swing should be with shoulder and hips, the arms just go along for the ride.  




 Darn, I missed the story.  




 No, I'm just saying that if oversteer is only thing, then the RS is the answer.  The ST is already faster and has more room.  




 Then why do I meet so many out on the golf course?  




 If everyone had your attitude, the range would not be able to keep up with the damage and repair cycle, and the would have to shut down the grass tees to allow them time to repair. 

Just hit in one straight line, not that hard.  




 The more I thought about it, the less I believe.  




 Your point?  You think the guys racing are racing stock? You can't talk about one car beating another on a autocross race track, then cry about budget. lol 




 So, I'll see you in autocross with the RS, in the rearview. 




 I almost down voted this comment.  




 The one I read and always remember...

Hogan was known for getting his 7 iron to stop on a dime.  Some guy asked him how he did that, to which Hogan replied with a question of his own. "Well, how far do you hit your 7?"  The man replied that he hit it about 130 yards, then Hogan said "Why in God's name would you want it to stop!?" 




 True, and the RS is the answer.  Which I'll be getting in 2017, and modifying my ST. 




 I have no hope for a girlfriend. 

I'm married.  




 Current 2014 Ford Focus ST.
Soon 2017 (I'm going to wait a year) Ford Focus RS.
I'll be keeping the ST and upgrading it.  




 Brazil?  




 A turbo set up would of added a grand to the sticker price.  Hell, my ST was the same price as the base model.  If they wanted to make that car fast, they could of.  Instead they made it look fast and spent their money on marketing.

But hey, if you like having a small fasy looking car that isn't fast at all, then good for you!   Just don't cry when I blow your doors off.   And God help you when I start to put upgrades into it.  




 Proudly. What does your car have that mine doesn't?  Yeah... 




 Ok, still doesn't mean that the FRS/BRZ is under powered.  It COULD of been a great car, but then they put a small engine in it.  Why make something small, light, and RWD if you're not going to make it fast?  It's like putting tits on a bull.  




 Just because CEO's and investment bankers are working less hours, doesn't mean the rest of us are. 

What an asshat.

I'm usually republican, but this current batch of idiots is worse than normal.  Paul is ok, but I'm actually for Bernie. 




 500 lbs heavier, but still is faster and handles better.  




 You drive a FR-S...  please don't be hating on the tank that is the crown vic.  Parts are easy to find and inexpensive, plus it's really easy to turn it into a go fast sleeper.  




 My FoST says that 200 IS under powered.  And the up coming RS just laughs. 




 Then I believe you.  I'm jealous, but I believe you.  You're probably a natural athlete and it sounds like you're putting in lots of practice time. 

Keep up the good work.  Don't neglect your short game and putting.  




 Did you play baseball or another sport before picking up golf? Did you take lessons? 




 Yeah, I can see doing this on the 8th hole, but 18th?  




 Yeah, that's completely wrong.  




 Sorry, I've heard those are good little cars.  




 Reminds me of something Stephen King wrote in the beginning or end of one of the Dark Tower books...

Some old lady wrote him, telling him how she was dying of cancer and wanted to know how the books would end, and she swore she wouldn't tell anyone.  It broke his heart to know he couldn't tell her, because at the time, he had no idea how it would end.   George R.R. says he has an idea on how it will end, but I wouldn't be surprised if he's just saying that to keep us from completely losing our collective shit, or if it doesn't change on him in the process of writing it. 

And the best part is, we'll get to see/know, if he finishes, because he's told D D how he thinks it will end.  So we get to compare, one day, maybe, hopefully... 




 Actually, that probably plays a bigger roll.  I don't build race cars, so I'm not 100% sure on any of my answers.  Just from my background, reading, and educated guess.   I'm thinking it's a combination of heat, turbo lag, and old school racing mentality.   




 Turbo lag.  When they are running less than 10 second 1/4 mile, turbo lag is a serious draw back.   If you have a "normal" car, the top end power of a turbo is a fair trade off for the half second of lag. 




 Good for you! 




 Without knowing how to drive stick? So, how much do you love it?  




 I wasn't sure if those came with auto options or not.  




 Thankfully Ford has our back, by making models that ONLY come in manual.  Focus ST and RS. 




 You truly are sad.  




 My feelings are fine. I just find it funny that you call me an asshole, then try to resort to unfounded personal attacks. So, feel free to try again, little man.  




 It is if they don't repot the tow. 




 I agree, that irons are important, so are wedges and putting, but I feel the driver is the most important.  If you can't put the ball safely in play, you're not going to score well.  I'm hitting my highest fairway percentage ever, and it's lowered my score a ton. 

But, I think the key to everyone's game is: Spend time on the range!  LOTS OF TIME.
 




 You can go back to your sad life now.  




 Did you happen to "find" those in someone's car? lol 




 No, I read it on an online magazine, before the Hellcat came out.  




 Some of the biggest track monsters that are our there are twin turbo charged mustangs.  All tuner guys know that the free HP you get from turbos is better than a supercharger.   Manufacturers use Superchargers because they require less piping, easier tuning/programing, and most "regular" people prefer the instant power of the Supercharger, and the dual scrolling turbos are still relatively new.  




 Plus, you call me an asshole, yet you're the one trying to make personal attacks.  Sounds like you need to take a good look in the mirror.  




 The head engineer of the Hellcat said they used the supercharger because he liked he sound.  




 No, a wife of six years who lives with me.  And I'm an asshole because that's how I was raised.  I don't need to change, you just need to accept that.  Please don't try to reflect your shitty life onto me.  
























 When stating the absurd and unlikely, do you really have to clarify if it's a joke or not?  




 So, then why didn't you slice the meat for him?  




 Do you know how much it cost to fix a car like that?  And you can't just take it to any old body shop. 

That car is wroth millions and if that repair is done incorrectly, it could destroy the value.  




 I'm with you!  I wanted to down vote him, but I'll up vote you instead. 

I'm married and love my wife, but I'd kill her for one night with Emma Watson.  




 My bird seed doesn't lady two days, when I fill up my feeders.  




 I'm a big fan of Bernie, but he's Pro governed, he'd never shut down a federal agency. 

Rand Paul on the other hand... 




 Rand Paul is making it an issue of his.  




 No kidding!  He's such a professional on the course, he's allowed to act his age when he's not.  On the course includes the clubhouse and grounds  (interviews), off is everywhere else.  




 Roose is such a horrible and evil person, that you can't help but like the guy.   

People think that Ramsey is a monster, but Roose raised that guy.  

But either way, I hate and love the TV show and book Roose more than I should.  




 Never seem A Dangerous Method.

I just thought that these two movies would have more of the same feel.  My expectations were kind of high.  




 Sure it was.  If I gave Eastern 1 star, then history would be 5 times better, but I gave it two and a half, so twice is technically correct. 

Or is my math wrong?  




 A History of Violence was at least 5 times better. 

I LOVED A History of Violence and thought that Eastern Promises looked like a great film.  I'd give it 2.5 out of 5 stars. 

So if we want to be technical, history was twice as good as promises. 




 Too far and expensive for that to be my home course.  We play there when ever we find a good deal on golfnow.com.   Couple times a season.  




 So, you wouldn't recommend it?  




 Seen Seven, and I kind of remember Zodiac.  




 I saw Social Network. Thought it was pretty good.  




 Couldn't agree more.  




 I don't even know what that means.  Is Fincher the director or the writer of the book? 

Gone Girl wasn't good?  What didn't you like? 

What would you recommend then?  




 Holy crow, that ending!  It's 10:30 at night, and my heart is pounding like I just watched a horror film.  I'm not sure if I'll be able to sleep tonight. 

I loved how it was broken up into 3 parts.  The last part was shorter than the rest, but the most horrifying. 

I clearly haven't read the book. Does it have the same ending? 




 Drugs are bad,  mkay. 




 Cersei is going to be put in trial by the faith and she will request a trial by combat.  She will name The Mountain as her champion.  The faith will bring in The Hound as their champion. 

Get fucking hype.  




 It boggles my mind, how much detail there is in those books.  How does he keep track of it all and how far in advance is he thinking? 

Man, I bet he'd be tough as nails in chess... 




 Wow, look at that.  




 Closing time.  You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here.  E.g. get the fuck out.  




 I haven't played 1, 2, or 3, and this was my first time on 4. I live in the nw burbs, so I don't get down that way often.  We will play broken arrow and ruffled feathers a few times a year.  




 He got tired of being in the background and not cared about.  There was a group of people that worshipped him as a god.  

Let that happen to you and see if it doesn't go to your head.  




 When everyone learns, the memes will stop.  




 I played St. Andrews in west chicago the day before and shot an 88. Shot a 103 on Dubsdread...  but it was also 91 degree with 80% humidity and cart path only.  My drives were all off, and I flubbed 6 pitches or chips into the sand. 

I want to play again in a few months when it's not so hot.  

On a Friday afternoon the pace was great.  4 hour round.  I've heard the weekends drag to 5+, which is unacceptable as far as I care. 

The fairways were great, the rough was really long, and the greens were lightning quick. 

Is it worth it? All things considered, I'd day yes, on occasion.  









 Except for the fact that it would be cheaper to just get the cars ac fixed.  




 Couldn't it be a lifter?  Maybe only the top end needs a rebuild.  




 That's the type of parent I want to be.  




 It's the first and oldest tournament.  All other opens are just copying The Open.  It doesn't need to be called anything else.  




 Rickon. 




 Those types of fireworks are illegal in Illinois.  




 I didn't down vote (not going to up vote either), but it's just a sparrow.  Used to get those fuckers in at Firestone once ever couple weeks in the summer.  




 I know it was a joke, but they aren't even taking about the biggest issue holding back self driving cars...

Software crashes.  How often does your computer or smartphone freeze?  Now picture that happening on the highway at freeway speeds...

Built in safety redundant procedures aren't going to work if the PCM is frozen.  




 No, I said that 9 out of 10 that I call in for an interview don't even show up for that interview or have a poor attitude. 

We tell every person that we have 3 requirements.  Show up on time, follow directions, and don't talk the whole time on the line.  If they can agree to those 3 requirements, they got the job.  If they do those 3 things they get to keep their job and get yearly raises.  




 Yes, my total was 25 instead of 20.

But I was trying to argue against the guy who's post I was replying too.   

That yes, many blacks do have a poor attitude and appear not to work, and that I have experience that can back that up. 

But then I also said that I blame the "black culture" that has been developed due to oppression and poor education. 

It's your white guilt (I'm assuming) that is making you think I am racist. 

I don't work near poor white trailer parks, but if I did, I'm guessing that the hiring pool would be rather crappy there too.  




 Thank you!  




 I've hired plenty of blacks.  Have 6 working for us right now.  




 As I stated above, every time I've called an "Africa American" that to their face, they laugh and tell me that they're black. 

And yeah, it's a manual labor job, as it says in the add posting.  And yes, it's the poor attitude that disqualifies anyone from a job.  Much like you seem to have. 

Sorry that I'm not hiring CEO's, owners, or recording artist. I'm just a guy working in a warehouse with 50 other people, trying to keep the product coming in the door, product getting assembled, and then shipped.   It starts at $11, but I have guys making $20.  




 How am I racist? My passing along my experience? I've said that I blame the generations of oppression and lack of education. And every "Africa American" I've ever called that, has laughed at me and told me they were black.  I almost married a black girl from the inner city and dated several others. 

 




 What other "evidence" do you want? I'm simply pointing out an observation.  




 I'm saying out of those 5, on average, 9 out of 10 don't show up.  I've set up over 100 interviews in my time.  So, 5 out of 20, then 9 out of 10. Makes sense if you think about it.  




 I just golf every weekend, buy new clubs every 3 years, and drink expensive bourbon.  Traded one addiction for two... 




 And nothing has happened since 2008?

Makes me wonder what the distance of the current long drive world record.   I see that 541 (?) is the longest on a PGA tour event, but has anyone hit one longer? 

And 541 yards?! Is there a video of this? That's crazy!  




 As someone who has been responsible for interviewing and hiring recommendations, I can attests to this.  Out of 20 people interviewed for a factory job (basic assembly using hand tools, paying $11 to start), 5 will be black, 5 white, 10 latin, 5 other.  9 out of 10 of the blacks don't show up on time or at all, and then are greatly unqualified (mostly poor attitude).  I blame the "black culture" somewhat, but mostly the education system.   We've let down entire generations which is the cause of this "black culture".

I don't have a solution, just the observations.  




 Correct. If it was my daughter, I would be all sorts of pissed.  




 I wasn't watching.  I take it he won again?  I'll be watching the open and rooting for him! I'd love to see a one year grand slam.  




 No way!  We have a black president and took down the rebel battle flag.  Racism is officially over!  We can do away with the aclu and naapc and affirmative action.  /sarcasm 




 And that's the difference between men and women.  I'm a man, and I always wished some older lady wanted to take advantage of me.  From 13 till now, all I think about is seeing women naked and on my penis.  I'm 35 and have some standards now, but as a teen, those standards were A LOT lower. 

That being said, I knew a kid who's mom pimped him out to men, and I've heard of some other fucked up shit, and that's wrong.  

But an older woman that wants to have sex with teenaged boys? Sure,that woman has mental issues, but as a father I wouldn't be upset if my son was WILLINGLY hooking up with some hot older lady.  




 And people are worried about mechanics taking their cars thru a drive thru... 




 Somewhat, but you learn to understand her motivations better.  




 Fix your own car then, if you're that uptight.   




 If people's biggest worry is their mechanic taking their car out for lunch, then they have their priorities mixed up.  They should be worried about the mechanic taking short cuts or making stupid mistakes or NOT test driving it...
