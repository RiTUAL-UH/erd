 I agree about microwave popcorn ripping people off, I just went for a little bit of ease here. Also, even microwave popcorn is fairly inexpensive. 
























 **I Hate Camping**

I get asked a lot, you know. Its weird, you wouldnt think its that common of a question. But I hear it from family, from my co-workers, hell, even from a few of my friends. 

Hey, wanna go camping some time?

I try not to be rude. I say:

No thanks, Im not a big fan of camping. Too many bugs.

I can usually stand the bugs, to be honest. And saying that Im not that big a fan of camping is an understatement, because the thought of camping, spending the night in a tent in the wilderness away from roads and buildings and electricity  well it sounds pretty shitty. I hate camping.

I try not to think about the last time I went camping. But the other day a coworker, Zack, brought it up to me. He said:

Im thinking of planning a big fishing trip weekend after next in Deckers! Calvin and Will said theyd be down. You in?

Umm. Maybe Where would we stay? (Deckers, a small town about a hundred miles into the Rockies, wasnt known for its selection of hotels)

Zack told me: Well, I was assuming wed just camp right beside the river. Bought a brand new tent after our bonuses came in-

No thanks! I interrupted. Im not really much of a camper.

I started to turn away, but Zack put a hand on my shoulder  Hey, whats wrong? Did I say something?

Its nothing, I just dont like to go camping. Too many bugs. I hadnt expected him to push, I was getting a little nervous.

I dont think its the bugs. Zack insisted. He was determined.

Its the bugs, I promise. I offered.

Bullshit. When we had the fire-ant problem in the break room, and you werent phased at all by that shit. Whats your problem with camping?

That was all it took. I broke down. Starting crying. Zack was startled and visibly regretful hed even asked. He started apologizing to me -
Shit man, Im sorry. I didnt think it was a big deal. Listen, if I said something-

Its wasnt you. I spoke, stifling back tears. I just I hate camping.

Zacks a good guy. But, he was curious about what I said, and I cant really blame him. 

Why? What happened? 

I told him what happened. Not then, I was still pretty choked up. We went to a bar that night, after work. We ordered a round of beers, and I told Zack the story of my last camping trip. I told him why I hate camping.

--------------------------

I was 18. It was early August of 06. It must have been 2006 cause thats the year I finished my last year of high school. Just east of the Rockies, its still warm that time of year. I had about 2 weeks left before I left home to go off to college. That was kind of rough, Id lived in the same neighborhood and had the same friends all of my life - I wasnt excited to say good bye to them.

Honestly, it had been a rough summer. I was stressed preparing to go off to school, I was sad to leave my friends behind, and on top of all of that, my high school sweetheart, Sarah, cheated on me sometime near the end of July. We broke up.

That probably doesnt seem relevant, and maybe it isnt, but what is relevant is how it affected me. See, I wasnt really myself that week. I was kind of floating through life, spaced-out. In my own little world. I was spending my dwindling free time wandering the old suburban neighborhood Id grown up in, feeling sorry for myself. Mostly, I wandered alone.

But I had good friends back then, and sometimes they wandered with me. My best friend, his name was August, noticed that I was a broken shell of a human being. He wanted to help. He must of.

I think youre spending too much time here.. August was a short kid, but he was athletic and handsome. He thought he was an expert when it came to girl problems.

What do you mean? 

I mean that youre spending all of your time around all the places that you and Sarah used to go. I can see it getting to you. You should get away for the weekend. 

I grimaced  I cant spare the weekend. I driving up to Silverthorne Saturday night to see my older brother before I leave.

What about just Friday night? We could go camping.

We were driving somewhere, I think, while we were talking. I dont remember where, but that isnt important. The only reason Im sure that we were driving is because I remember swerving a little when he suggested it. I guess I was never much of a camper.

I havent been camping since we were in boy scouts. 

Itd be good for you man! We could get everybody to go. Itd be a good last hurrah, ya know?

So we went camping. Not all of our friends could get permission from their parents to go, but some did. There were seven of us. It was August and I, two girls named Lyndsey and Morgan, a guy named Chris, and a couple  Matt and Dana. We left Friday afternoon. Well, thats not entirely true.

August, Lyndsey, Morgan, Chris, and I left Friday afternoon. Dana had work until 6pm, so she and Matt were going to drive up separately from us that evening. The campground we had chosen was a mountain trail about 50 miles west of where we lived. It wasnt that long a drive, but it was in the mountains, away from civilization, and most of all, you didnt have to pay to get in. The name of the campground was Rampart Range.

I spaced out pretty hard during the drive up. Everyone was going out of their way to cheer me up, but I was having trouble getting my mind completely clear. I read off the directions that wed printed from the Map Quest website so Morgan, who was driving, could get there, but I wasnt really aware of where we were going. I was still in my own little world. Maybe if I was a little more lucid, I would have reconsidered the trip in its entirety.

The five of us got to the trail at about 4pm. There were a bunch of different trails in Rampart Range, so we choose one near the entrance. Morgan parked the car and we climbed out onto dry grass. I groaned and stretched to get rid of the kinks that the drive had put in my neck. I looked around. There was a small trail that ran through some trees, about twenty feet from where we parked.

Shall we? August suggested. He was eager as ever.
We started hiking down the trail to find a place to camp. We hiked for about thirty minutes until the trail led to a small clearing that was deserted. It had a place for a fire pit, probably set up by a Park Ranger, or the owners of the trail. The clearing looked like it got plenty of use  I could see a few empty beer cans and cigarette butts near one edge of the camp. The aesthetic wasnt pleasing, but hey, beggars cant be choosers. We set up camp.

Camp consisted of a small fire and three tents. One tent was smaller, and we had reserved that one for Matt and Dana when they got there. The other two were the same size, so two people (Chris and Morgan, if I recall correctly) slept in one tent, and the rest of us (August, Lyndsey, and I) slept in the other. I dont know how we came to that arrangement, but I remember being mad that I was crammed in a tent with two other people.

I have to admit that the fresh mountain air and the hiking were doing me good. I was on the way to forgetting my worries and I was truly enjoying the time we were spending in the mountains. I remember that we climbed a bunch of huge rocks that we found in the woods near our campsite, and that August, Chris, and I played Hacky-Sack while Morgan and Lyndsey tried to get the fire going. 

At around 7:30, something hit me. I realized that Matt and Dana hadnt shown up yet. It was going to get dark soon. The sky was already that shade of orange it becomes when the sun starts setting. They wouldnt be able to find the trail in the dark.

I tapped the contact for Matt in my phone, trying to call him. Phone reception was pretty spotty in the mountains, and he wasnt picking up. At around 8, I could feel myself growing frustrated. Either Matt was ignoring me or his cellphone wasnt working or wasnt getting service or some shit. I took a break from calling and left my phone in my tent. It was sitting neatly on top of my sleeping bag, where Id be able to get to it easily if Matt called back. 

Chris and August were sitting around the fire roasting hot dogs. I sat down next to them. It was already getting pretty dark  you couldnt see past the trees at the edge of the camp anymore. But the fire was glowing fairly brightly, so I tried not worry about Matt and Dana. Chris and August were talking about high school, and all the kids we had known but would probably never see again. I listened for a while, until Lyndsey interrupted.

Hey, your phone has been buzzing for like, the last 30 minutes. She said, putting my phone in my hand.

Oh shit, thanks for telling me. I replied.

Any time. Lyndsey smiled. 

Eight missed calls from Dana and Matt. *Fuck*, I thought. I called Matt back as soon as I could. The reception was still pretty bad, but he picked up. 

Hello?

Hey Matt! Where are you guys? Its already dark here!

Were fucking lost in this stupid place. Who the fuck chose this campground?

Calm down, describe what you see, Ill help you navigate.

I see trees and rocks and literally nothing else.

Matt, try to be helpful here.

Matt handed the phone to Dana. Her tone was more relaxed than Matts.

Ignore Matt, weve been driving for a couple hours and hes in a bad mood.

Yeah I gathered that.

Which one of the trails did you stop at?

I considered her question for a minute. I had been pretty zoned out when we drove into the campsite, so I wasnt really sure. 

I dont know, but it was near the entrance to Rampart Range, if that helps any.

Uhhh. Weve passed like 20 different trails

Oh shit, right. Well, we took Morgans Dads car. Maybe you guys could look for her car?

What kind of car is it?

Hold on.

I yelled to Morgan. What kind of car did we drive here?

Morgan was in her tent, but she leaned out the flap and yelled Its a Ford Explorer!

I could hear Matt grunting something through the phone. 

Dana you there?

Yeah I am. Dana whispered something quietly to Matt. Matt, chill out Im sure hes just trying to get out of the campground.

Morgans car is a blue Ford Explorer. It should be the 3rd or 4th trail when you enter the campground.

Sounds good. I think we just drove a little too far so  Matt just pull over and let him pass

Her voice was sharp and she sounded irritated. Dana what are you talking about?

Oh, theres this guy tailgating Matt and I in a big white truck. 

Hes been following us for the last 5 miles or so, but Im sure hes just trying to find his way out of the campground.

I could hear Matt in the background of the call. He yelled Hey fucker, back off!

Dana covered the receiver with her hand so I couldnt hear Matt anymore Im going to let you go. If we get lost again Ill give you a call.

She hung up. Honestly I was relieved, you could hear how stressed she was in her tone. Everyone at our campsite was starting to get tired. Chris and Morgan wandered off to their tent to get some shut eye. That was what they told us anyway. The rumor was that they had been hooking up all summer, and this was just another opportunity to spend some alone time together. Anyway, that left August, Lyndsey and I sitting around the fire, killing time until Matt and Dana showed up. 

Around 10pm we started getting worried. It had already been a long day and camping has a way of taking it out of you. My ass was sore from sitting on the hard ground beside the fire pit. I wanted desperately to go to sleep, but I was determined to wait for Matt and Dana. I was considering calling Matt again while August and Lyndsey were talking about a mutual friend of ours named Peter, and how he had decided to go to Europe for a year instead of going to college.

Matt, it was fine. I bet he was just lost.

It sounded like Danas voice. It was coming from the trail, which was out of view behind a few trees. I stood up and walked towards the trail. Matt and Dana looked like they had been walking for the last hour or so. They were covered in dirt and pine needles. Their eyes were bloodshot and strained. There were bags underneath their eyes, and Matt walked with a slight limp. They looked exhausted. You could tell from Danas tone that they were growing tired of one another.

No Dana, that was creepy as fuck. Matt snapped.

Hey, whats going on guys? I asked.

Matts voice broke when he spoke. He didnt just sound angry he sounded scared. 
Some guy in a white truck followed us while we were driving through this stupid fucking campground.

Im sure he was just trying to find his way out of the campground. I suggested.

Yeah thats what I thought too. But then we found Morgans car. I parked beside it. I thought that when I turned the car to park, the guy who was following us would keep on driving down the road. But he didnt.

Dana was quiet. What do you mean? I asked.

Matt hesitated. When I got out of the car, the guy in the white truck just stayed there. He just sat there. Watching us.

Matt, Dana and I stood at the edge of the trail, silently. You could feel the tension in the air.

Was he there when you left the car? 

Matt nodded silently. Dana had started to cry, and Matt was pale and shaken. Ill admit that I was shivering a little myself. Lyndsey and August exchanged a quick glance.

Maybe we should just go? Lyndsey stammered. The story had clearly spooked her as well.

Yes! Lets get the fuck out of here. Matt interjected.

No! Look guys were already here. Its already dark. August argued. Lets just go to bed, and well leave in the morning okay?

Scared as we all were, August was right. It was dark, and it would take half an hour to get back to the car, never mind the drive home. We went to bed. August and I slept in one tent, with Lyndsey in between us. We were teenagers, so we felt like we needed the buffer to preserve our masculinity, I guess. Dana and Matt slept in the other tent. Our tent was in between the other two, and my sleeping bag was on the side of the tent closest to Matt and Danas tent.

It was so dark out that you couldnt see your hand two feet in front of your face. We all tried to go to sleep. I was pretty freaked out from Matts story. I couldnt sleep. I laid in my sleeping bag listening to August and Lyndsey snore loudly. The whole time, I just kept thinking about the person in the white truck who had creeped Matt and Dana out. Probably just some drunk fucker looking to mess with a couple of teenagers I thought. The wind was howling outside, making the grass outside whistle.

Around 2 in the morning, I was just starting to drift into sleep when I hear a noise by my head. 

Lyndsey, shh, Im trying to sleep. I whispered. The noise didnt sound like Lyndsey talking. It sounded like a twig snapping. It sounded like someone had someone had stepped on a stick.

I sat up. I heard the noise again. This time it was the sound of a footstep on the matted grass below it. The wet sound of the foot lifting slowly in the grass. It was coming from right beside me. It was coming from just outside my tent. Then, I heard a second noise. It sounded like something heavy was being drug through the grass. I wasnt sure what it was until I heard a metallic CLUNK as the heavy object was dragged over a rock in the grass.

*I must be imagining this*, I thought. *The noise is all in my head.*

The footsteps were getting closer and closer to the entrance to our tent. I could hear that dragging sound the whole time. I thought I was dreaming. 

Then I heard Matts voice from the other tent. Does anyone else hear that?

I felt all of my breath leave my lungs. I hear it Matt.

I was overcome by absolute terror. I think Matt was too, because he didnt say a word. All I could do was wake August and Lyndsey.

What is it-August started

 Shh. Do you hear that? I whispered.

Everyone was silent. There was no sound outside, except for the wind and the brushing of the grass against the tent. Then I heard the faintest noise. I couldnt tell what it was at first, it sounded like metal.

Then I realized. It was the zipper of my tent. It was slowly being pulled open from the outside. 

What the fuck!? August yelled. The second he yelled, the noise stopped and whoever (or WHATEVER) was unzipping our tent, started running. You could hear its heavy footsteps sprint through the campsite.

Overcome with stupidity or courage, or maybe a little of both, August tore our tent open. He ran outside to see if he could see what was fucking with us.

I dont see anything guys.

By this point, all seven of us were out of the tents. I was shaking. Matt and Dana had both been through so much, they were trembling violently.

Should we leave? Chris quivered. I think he was annoyed that his time alone with Morgan had been interrupted, but he was scared as well.

Its 3 in the goddamn morning. Its too dark to leave. I mumbled.

There were murmurs of reluctant agreement from my friends. It was too dark and early to try to leave now. No one was ballsy enough to walk back to the car in the absolute darkness that was the night. We decided that we would try to get some rest, and leave the second it was light enough out to see.

I dont think Ive ever slept worse. I was so horrified that every time the wind blew or the grass rubbed against a tent, I almost yelped. But we made it through the night. When it started to get light out, around 7 or 8 in the morning, we warily climbed out of our sleeping bags, packed up the campsite and left. I don't think any of us were really sure what had happened to us. Chris had suggested that it was a deer or something equally as harmless. No one else could dismiss our absolute terror that easily. The footsteps were too heavy to be a deer. The way it walked was so deliberate, like whatever we heard was trying not to be heard. I still have nightmares about the sound of our tents zipper slowly opening. 

--------------------------

Fuck man. Id probably hate camping too, if that happened to me. Zack lamented over his third or fourth beer.

Yeah. It was a rough night. I sighed.

Zack yawned. It was late. I had been talking for a long time. Zack chuckled and put two tens down on bar counter.

Well, god knows Im not getting any sleep tonight, after a story like that.

Yeah. Now you know how I feel.

You need a ride back? He asked.

Nah. Ill walk. The bar was only a few minutes from my apartment.

Suit yourself. Zack said, standing up and cracking his back. See you at work tomorrow?

Yeah man. See you.

As I walked home I thought about that night in Rampart Range. That night was the most terrifying night of my entire life. Zack probably thought it was a pretty good ghost story. I bet he would tell it on his fishing trip with Calvin and Will. 

But I didnt tell Zack the worst part. I wasnt sure he could have taken it.

After we left the campground, we all went home to get some sleep. After a few hours of much needed rest, Matt went in to the office where his mom worked. Shes an attorney, or something.
He was waiting for his mom to finish a meeting. While he waited, he chatted with his moms secretary, Denise.

You look tired. Rough night? She joked.

Yeah. I went camping. It was kind of crappy.

Whys that?

I dont know. I guess we just choose a sketchy place to camp is all.

Denise frowned. Where was that?

Some campground called Rampart Range, or something like that.

Denise started crying, almost immediately. Matt was startled. He told me she cried for almost thirty minutes before she was calm enough to talk again.

When Matt told me this part of the story, I asked him why she had gotten so upset. Matt went pale. He looked like he was going to cry.

Denise said her son went camping in Rampart Range a few months ago. He and his friends were attacked by someone at their campground. Their attacker ripped open their tent in the middle of the night. Her sons friends were found a day later by a park ranger, beaten within an inch of their life. Their attacker had used a heavy metal hammer on them. But they got off lucky. Denises sons body was found dismembered and strewn violently throughout the campsite. They never found the guy who did it.

I hate camping.

 Hopefully this is the right place. With the announcement of fallout 4, I realized I want to be able to play newly released games again. My last actual console was the Xbox 360, and I've been squeezing by with a decent laptop for games for the last 3 or 4 years. I can run games like l4d2, but not games like dead rising 3.

To play games like fallout 4 and dead rising 3,  would it be cheaper to build a gaming PC or get a used Xbox one?
What price ranges should I expect?

 Get a used Xbox one?






 
























 I rode the bus to school from the time I was in kindergarten until I was 16 and started driving myself to school. The one exception to that was a month when I was nine years old in which my mother drove me instead. That month began on November 3rd, 2003. After November 3rd, the school didnt have a bus to drive us to school in. More importantly, they didnt have a driver.

Up until November 3rd, our school owned only one school bus  it was your traditional number-2-pencil-yellow bus that seated 36 screaming elementary school kids. The bus picked my older brother and me up every morning from our neighborhood bus stop, which was about a block away from our house. I could just barely see my house from where we would stand when we waited for the bus. Nobody got picked up at our bus stop except for my brother and I, but the bus came by anyway. 

I dont remember riding on the school bus very well, but I remember my elementary school bus driver. His name was Thomas Blackford. Nobody called him that though. Everybody called him Mr. Tom. Mr. Tom was a big, fat man with a great grey beard and a bald head. He had one of those comfortable smiles that youd expect Santa Claus to have. He always played the radio stations that we liked and on the last day of school he gave everyone who rode the bus a bag of candy to take home. Everybody who rode the bus loved Mr. Tom.

I guess I should tell you now, Mr. Tom is dead. He died in 2003. He was murdered. I dont know exactly when he was killed, but it was sometime in early November. This is the story of November 3rd  The day I didnt get on the bus.

I was in second grade. Because the 3rd was a Monday, my brother and I hadnt ridden on the bus since the Friday before. It started like any Monday morning. That is, it started with my mom banging on the door to the bedroom that my brother and I shared and yelling If you dont get out of bed in the next five minutes, youre going to miss the bus! And theres no way Im driving you to school!It gets pretty cold here in November, so my brother, Bryan, and I had no intention of trying to walk to school. I slipped out from between my covers, groaning as I went. I got dressed and brushed my teeth. It was cold that day. I remember shivering as I slipped my blue down coat on over my shoulders. I always hated waiting for the school bus when it was cold out. Especially if it had been snowing.

Unfortunately for me, not only had it been snowing all morning, it was still snowing. There was about 3 inches of wet, slushy snow covering the street in front of my house, and more on the way. The second I opened the door so Bryan and I could leave, I was struck by a gust of frigid wind that blew wet, stinging snow into my eyes. I was already shaking by the time I stepped outside. Like I said, you could see the bus stop from my house, it was only about a block away. But in that weather, that block felt like it could have been a mile.
	
Before I could suggest to my brother that we shouldnt wait for the bus in such conditions, my mother yelled Close that door, youre letting the cold air in! 

I didnt grow up in the kind of house where you argued with a comment like that. Bryan quickly shut the door behind him, pulled his hat down over his ears, and trudged past me, through the dirty snow that lined the sidewalk. I followed Bryan, who was grumbling quietly under his breath. 

The school bus usually arrived sometime around 8:30. When Bryan and I got to the bus stop, it must have been a little before that, based on what I remember. Sometimes the bus got to our stop a minute or two late, so we werent surprised to have to wait a few extra minutes. Looking back now, everything would have been different if it wasnt snowing. My brother and I shook in the freezing snow and waited for the bus to pull around the corner at the intersection to the south of us. 

At around 8:35, I could feel my toes growing numb - my teeth were audibly chattering. I wondered if we had already missed the bus. I didnt wear a watch then, I was too young, but Bryan had a cheap, old timex watch that mom had gotten him. 

Bryan did we get here late?

No. The bus is just running a little late. 

I frowned. Bryan was not a morning person.

Are you sure? I dont think Mr. Tom has been this late before.

Yes. Im sure. Be quiet.

My hands were beginning to lock up from the cold. I could feel the joints in my fingers turn stiff and tired. Despite my down coat, I was shaking all over my body.

Thats why I felt so relieved when I saw our school bus as it turned the corner at the bottom of our street, and slowed as it pulled towards us. I was finally going to be in the heated bus where my frozen body could thaw. I couldnt wait for Mr. Tom to open the door and greet us with a hardy Good Morning and a warm grin.

But when the door opened, there was no warm grin. There was no Mr. Tom. When the door to our bus opened, I didnt see the husky frame sitting behind the wheel of the bus that I expected. I saw a small, thin man sitting on the seat. He had the bus drivers uniform on him, but it didnt fit quite right. It looked too big, like he was completely engulfed by it. His hair was thinning and covered in grease and dirt, not shiny and smooth like Mr. Toms bare head. 

The drivers smile filled his whole face. His teeth were yellowed and his gums brown and black. The most striking thing I remember about his face, however, was his eyes. They were huge, and his pupils were dilated so large that they almost completely covered the irises of his eyes. 

Wheres Mr. Tom? I asked hesitantly, as I climbed onto the first step leading up to the bus.

He called in sick today. The man spoke softly and with a disconnected rhythm. It sounded like he was straining to produce the words. I looked past him, and saw that there were only a few children sitting in their seats on the bus. Only three or four. Usually the bus was almost full by the time it got to our stop.

Where is everybody, mister? I was getting nervous, but the bus was so warm that I was drawn towards it. Bryan, who was standing behind me on the sidewalk complained loudly.

Will you just get on? Its cold out here.

Well mister, where is everyone?

Not sure. Guess they must be sick. His smile slowly faded and his lips curled into a cartoonish frown. Better get on I think were a little late.

I was still nervous, but I was only nine - young enough not to question something that an adult had told me. I put my foot on the second step of the bus and started to move forward. The bus drivers dopey frown transformed into that sick smile almost instantly as I started to move forward. I was only a few feet from him when I felt a strong hand grab my shoulder from behind. 

I was pulled back to the sidewalk by a tall woman in a bathrobe. Before I could protest or try to resist, I realized it was my mother. She had her arms wrapped around Bryan and I, and she was pulling us away from the bus.

Mom, whats wrong? Bryan asked, as she pulled him and me closer to her.

Who are you? She stammered at the driver.

The drivers face quickly melted back into a frown and his giant eyes narrowed. He didnt say anything to her.

What do you think youre doing? Who are you? My mom insisted. Her voice was shrill and full of confusion.

The driver didnt reply. Instead, the same horrible smile from before spread back over his face. He pulled the lever that closes the door, and stepped on the gas. The bus moved forward quickly, and made a sharp right turn at the end of our block. My brother, mother, and I stood in the snow, shivering, watching the bus slide slightly as it careened around the corner. Before we could ask any questions, my mother pulled my brother and I back to the house. She was frantic. Her skin looked pale, especially in her dark purple bathrobe. She looked nervous, almost scared. She just kept saying-

Hurry up. Get inside. She herded Bryan and I inside and sat us down at the dining room table. Stay here She warned.

Bryan and I were confused, and our mothers visible fear had made me scared as well. All sorts of thoughts ran through my head  maybe grandpa had another heart attack, or maybe Bryan and I had gotten in trouble for something. Why else would Mom walk all the way out to the bus stop and stop us from getting on the bus?

Bryan and I listened as she called the school district from the kitchen. I could just barely make out what she was saying.

The bus was definitely out there! No, it wasnt the usual driver! She listened intently to whoever was on the other side of the line. After a moment, she said Okay I will.

She hung up the phone and began to dial another number. 

Whats going on? Bryan asked.

Not now Bryan. I need to talk to the police.

Our mom stayed on the line with the cops for almost 20 minutes. Bryan and I looked at each other in silence as our mom told the officer on the phone about the man we saw driving the bus.

I would learn several days later that while my mom was talking on the phone, the new bus driver picked up five more children. The bus, which had eight total children on it, all between the ages of seven and twelve, would abandon its normal route at 8:52, after its 12th scheduled stop, and drive onto local highway 78. The driver would accelerate to over 100 miles per hour, according to eyewitness reports. The bus would begin violently weaving in and out of its lane, coming close to hitting several different vehicles who would later call 911 to report its erratic behavior. 

At approximately 9:17, despite the desperate pleas of the crying children aboard the bus, it would drive onto the only bridge in Gilliman County. It would cross about half of the bridge, according to the bridges caretaker, Kris Lopez. Mr. Lopez would later tell reporters that the bus made a violent right turn at the center of the bridge. He would explain that he could see the terrified face of a little girl screaming from one of the windows as the bus broke through a metal guard rail and fell into the icy river. 

The official police report would state that all nine bodies were found. Dead. The bus had crashed through the ice at the top of the river and floated approximately a mile before it became stuck on a patch of rocks and a downed tree. All of the occupants of the bus had intense bruising, blood loss, and broken bones.

The police officer who went to the home of Thomas Blackford to ask him about the incident would find his door unlocked and the inside of his home completely trashed. When looking in his bedroom, they would find his corpse horribly mutilated. The Giliman County Coroner would tell reporters that Mr. Tom was most likely murdered by an intruder while he slept. The cops would find that his bus drivers uniform and keys to the bus had been stolen.

This is all the information Ive been able to find about the day that I almost got on that bus. Theres probably a lot more information out there about November 3rd, but I imagine a lot of it hasnt been released to the public. Ive read almost every newspaper story, eyewitness report, and police document that I could bring myself to. None of it has answered the question that I cant seem to stop asking myself.

Why wasnt I on that bus? I had been a step away from joining the kill count of the horrible little man who murdered Mr. Tom and those eight children. I was so close to dying in that crash. I still wake up in the middle of the night, imagining that little girls crying face as the fender struck the ice, going god knows how fast. I cant stop imagining the way the drivers disgusting smile as he drove the bus off that bridge. My survival haunts me. Why wasnt I on the bus?

The closest thing I have to an answer to that question was what my mother told when she got off the phone with the officer that morning, on November 3rd.

I asked her- Mom, whyd you stop us from getting on the bus?

Tears started filling her eyes as she told Bryan and me the truth.

The school called. Today is a Snow Day. The bus shouldnt have been running at all.

 Really hoping that I'm not. 




 Human beings are fascinating. I always look at other people and wonder what theyre thinking. I think about all the things they do, and I wonder why. Why do we do the things we do? More importantly, what makes us change the things we do? How does behavior change?

After I graduated high school, I was intrigued by questions like these, and I decided that I wanted to attend college to study psychology. My parents tried as best as they could to be supportive of me, and they encouraged me to apply to as many colleges as I could. Unfortunately, I came from a fairly poor family, so most big-name schools were simply too expensive for my family to afford, regardless of whether I could get into them.

Luckily, one school sent me a letter that offered a solution to my problem. This university had a work-study program that would allow me to study psychology, while working for the school on the side in order to pay for it.

Although the school in question, Winnberg University of Science, was in a small town somewhere out in Giliman County, Colorado, I was surprised to find out that a lot of important psychology research had taken place there. Despite its size, it was a beacon for famous researchers who were studying behavior and behavioral modification, like B.F. Skinner and John B. Watson. 

I was very excited to leave my hometown behind and begin the college lifestyle. However, the university failed to say in its letter that work-study meant that the school could work me like a dog. When I got to Winnberg, I was immediately assigned to a student janitorial crew. We worked every night from 9pm to midnight, cleaning up other students messes.

During the day, I learned about behavioral science and psychology. I was even lucky enough to get into Psych 105 with the renowned Dr. Kingsman. Hes a fairly well known psychologist, and the fact that he taught at Winnberg was one of the reasons I was excited to go there. My classes that first semester were quite rigorous, so I didnt have much time for anything besides my studying and janitorial work. I cant say I was really getting much experience with the college lifestyle, but I was enjoying my time, nonetheless. 

For a while, life was pretty repetitive  I went to class at day, and cleaned up classrooms and lecture halls at night. However, towards the end of my first semester, I was given a new assignment by the head janitor, Skip.

Yer studyin psychology or something, right?

Yes sir. I replied.

Well son, I got a project you might be interested in doing then. You ever been in the sub-basement of Skinner Hall?

Skinner Hall was the building that housed the psychology department at Winnberg. It was a very old building, but the upper floors where I had class were well-kept and refurbished. I had heard people talk about how the lower floors were in bad condition, but I had never been down there, personally.

The Dean asked us to clean out the whole bottom floor of that place. I cant spare all of my guys for it, but I think it sounds like the perfect job for ya.

While I wasnt sold on the idea of cleaning out the creepy sub-basement by myself, it beat cleaning disgusting campus bathrooms. The next day, instead of meeting with the whole janitorial crew, I met Skip in the lobby of Skinner hall. He handed me an old brass key and led me to one of the elevators that ran through the building.

Alright son. Yer gonna take this key and put it in the keyhole thats to the right of all the buttons in the elevator, understand? It should take ya right to the basement.

I nodded intently and stepped into the elevator. It was an old, rickety thing. When I stepped inside, I could feel the whole thing shake and hear the metal foundation groan. I turned around the press turn the key, and I saw Skip was still standing in the door way to the elevator. 

Hey! Dont take nothin while yer down there, ya got me?

I told him I understood, and I inserted the key as the elevator doors closed. It reluctantly turned, and the elevator slowly descended deeper into the building. The elevator in Skinner hall moved very slowly, and it was almost a full minute before the doors opened in the sub-basement.

The sub-basement wasnt just in need of a good cleaning  it was absolutely disgusting. Garbage and old, broken furniture covered the floor. The whole place stank of mold and rot. The air was so damp that it was hard to breathe. It was like climbing into a sewage pipe. The worst part, was the pained sound of the air conditioner. The vents down here were clogged with dust and dirt, and the air made a constant wheezing sound as it filled the room.
The sub-basement consisted of an old hallway which led into a series of three dilapidated laboratories. I traipsed slowly through the sub-basement, taking in my surroundings. 

The most interesting of the three rooms was the smallest one, which stood at the southern end of the hallway. It was only about forty feet by forty feet. This room was full of old desks, bookshelves, and cardboard boxes, all seemingly empty and in various states of decay. One of the walls was covered in old, wooden boards, which were hanging loosely from rusted nails that hung in the wall. 

I remember thinking that the room I had entered smelled like something I recognized, but couldnt place. Like burnt fabric, or something.

The other two rooms were simply full of garbage and scrap, but this southern most room still had most of the supplies it would have needed to be used. I decided to clean the other two rooms first, since it appeared that this small room was going to be the hardest. As I was walking out of the small room, I noticed a small placard on the wall. On it, in dusty ceramic letters read:

**DR. RICHARD J. KALIVAKI**

It took me three nights to fully clean out all the garbage and broken furniture from the two larger rooms. Every night, I would haul a bunch of trash bags down into the sub-basement, fill them with crap, and bring them back up. It was painstaking work, especially in the disgusting environment of the sub-basement.
Once I had all the junk out of those two rooms, I realized that I would probably need clean the grime and filth off the floors and walls in each room with a power washer. Rather than start on that arduous task, I thought I should clean out the smaller room first, so I could power wash the whole basement at once, when the time came.

So on the fourth night, I brought a bunch of trash bags and some gloves down to the sub-basement so I could start removing the heavy furniture. Skip had instructed me to throw all of the old furniture away because it was too rotted to be of any value or use to the school.

The first thing I tried to pull out of the room was a dilapidated old desk. After a failed attempt at lifting the heavy desk, I tried to drag it out of the room. As I was pulling the old piece of shit, I bumped into a flimsy bookshelf that stood in the center of the room. The bookshelf teetered over, and crashed into a stack of cardboard boxes that was sitting against one wall. The bookshelf splintered into several pieces.

I groaned and leaned down to remove the broken pieces from on top of the shelf. As I cleared away the debris, I noticed that one of the boxes had burst open. A stack of paper had fallen out of the box onto the ground in front of me. I was intrigued, and I picked it up. The thin stack of paper was stapled together. The cover page read:

**The Bad-Wife Experiment - 1954**
**Kalivaki, Richard J.  PhD, Psychology**
**Winnberg University of Science**

My fascination with psychology immediately took over. Rather than getting back to my cleaning, or even picking up the pieces of the broken bookshelf, I sat down in one of the dilapidated chairs and flipped open the short packet. 

There was a short note paper clipped to the first page of the study. It read:

*Dr. Kalivaki,*

*The Journal of Abnormal Psychology is not willing to publish your study at this time. We find that the methods described herein violate several pieces of our Human Rights doctrine. Specifically, the objective of your experiment, as well as the methods used to achieve said objective. We apologize for the inconvenience. Please do not attempt to submit this paper again.*

*Benjamin Blackford*

*The Journal of Abnormal Psychology*

This unusual note piqued my interest even more. I unclipped the note and read the page under it.
I could tell by the handwritten script and irregular phrasing that this wasnt a normal study. It read more like a diary than an academic study. The first page began as follows:

*February 19th, 1954 - This experiment will analyze the extent to which behavior modification techniques can be used to affect a persons objectives and actions. I will be primarily employing differential reinforcement techniques on several male test subjects to measure the extent to which they can be manipulated into changing their behavior.*

I had learned about differential reinforcement in one of my classes. It consisted of giving a reinforcer or bribe when someone did something you wanted them to do, and punishing them if they did something you didnt want them to do. I kept reading.

*Ive sent out a flyer to all the married men in town, explaining that theyve been asked to take part in a study about marital satisfaction. I hoping that the flyer will pull in at least a few viable subjects for my test.
I was able to acquire a low grade chair from an acquaintance of mine who works at the jail. They should provide a sufficient aversive stimulus for the means of this experiment. The chair has been plugged in inside the experiment room. I was able to dial its power down tremendously. It should only release a mild shock, rather than a life threatening one. Im hoping its leather straps will still be able to hold my subjects*

What the fuck? I murmured quietly to myself. The writings about the electric chairs in the notes were bizarre. I assumed these notes must have been someones absurd joke, and I threw the packet back on top of one of the desks in the room.

Rather than read the strange study, I spent the next few hours cleaning up the debris I had created in the musty room. I left around 1 A.M., and returned to my dorm room. Since it was a school night, almost everyone in the dorms seemed to already be asleep. I crawled into my bed and shut my eyes tightly. I forgot quickly about the study. I assumed it was just somebodys sick joke.

 The bizarre experiment didnt cross my mind again until the elevator stopped at the sub-basement floor again, and I saw the old, yellowed packet of paper resting securely on top of one of the remaining desks.

Without hesitation, I flipped open the packet and continued reading where I had left off.

*"February 24th 1954  Ive had a great deal of responses to my message. Four different men have responded to my inquiry and will be arriving for the test over the next few days. Ive prepared all of the images for the projector. Ive decided to arrange the room as follows:"*

Below this paragraph was a hastily drawn diagram of a small room. In the room, there was a drawing of small chair labeled E.C., which I assume stands for electric chair. In front of the chair was a box labeled Projector and a spot on the wall labeled Image. Based on the drawing, the room was around 20 by 20 feet. It was smaller than Dr. Kalivakis lab. His writing continued:

 *"I was skeptical of how I would acquire the In-Pain images, but luckily, I was able to bring back a young woman to my apartment two nights ago. The pictures I took should be suitable to show a woman in pain. The first subject, Samuel Armingham, will arrive around 5pm this Friday. I will write the results of the test on Mr. Armingham then.*

*February 27th 1954  The experiment went off quite swimmingly. Mr. Armingham is certainly no worse for the wear, although one of his arms is continuing to twitch. Ive instructed him that it is a temporary side effect after his prolonged treatment, and it should last no longer than a few weeks. The treatment only lasted 18 hours. I am pleased with the limited duration it took to treat Mr. Armingham.*

*The experiment began at approximately 17:20. When Mr. Armingham arrived I instructed him to sit in the chair labeled E.C in my diagram. He was resistant at first, but yielded upon being told that he would be compensated for his time. Once in the chair, I proceeded to strap Mr. Armingham in using the provided leather straps. It is worth noting that he was able to damage one of the straps during his flailing (unfortunately, they did not hold up as I hoped.) I will make sure to reinforce them with steel cuffs during the next trial.*

*After being strapped in, Mr. Armingham was shown a projection of a woman who was smiling. I asked Mr. Armingham if this picture made him feel good or bad. His first response was good.*

*I set the dial to 25 volts and pressed the switch. Mr. Armingham reacted negatively to this jolt and protested quite loudly. I assured him it was simply part of the experiment.*

*I then showed Mr. Armingham a projection of a woman crying. I asked him if it made him feel good or bad. He responded bad.*

*I delivered a 50 volt shock to Mr. Armingham. I will have to remember to sound proof the testing room, as his scream grew quite loud after the 50 volt shock. His protests continued.*

*I showed Mr. Armingham the picture of the woman smiling again. I asked him his feelings, and he told me it made him feel bad. I did not deliver a shock, but audibly told him I was turning the electricity down to only 25 volts.*

*I then displayed the image of the In-Pain Woman. Mr. Armingham responded with disgust to the bruising and bleeding displayed on the womans face. When asked how he felt, he responded quite loudly that he felt bad.*

*I turned the dial to 150 volts of electricity and sent the shock into his body. He displayed physical signs of pain and began pleading for me to stop.*

*I continued the cycle of these pictures. I subbed in the other five pictures of an in-pain woman throughout the next several hours. After one hour, Mr. Armingham consistently answered that he felt bad about the smiling woman and good about the woman in pain. I reduced the amount of shock when he gave the correct answers. By the third hour, I only used the shock from the chair to discourage his pleadings to be allowed to go free. I continued the test through the night to verify that he was automatically correct responses. He was allowed to go free at around 11:00 Saturday morning. I will update with the long term results of my experiment."*

It was with both fascination and horror that I read the next paragraph.

*"February 25th 1954  The results of my test came quicker than I would have guessed. Mr. Armingham was arrested late last night for the murder of his wife and youngest daughter. It is my understanding that both deaths were from physical beatings with a small hammer belonging to Mr. Armingham. I believe this is a result of the pictures I showed, which clearly showed the results of physical beating. I will have to test this result. The next subject comes in tomorrow at 13:00."*

I felt sick to my stomach. I cautiously flipped through the rest of the study, which detailed the next three trials. All of them displayed similar results. The worst by far was the third trial. It began similarly, but took a different direction during the 10th hour of testing. 

*"Mr. Ternbauld had begun repeating his wifes name while pleading to be let go at around 19:00. He said phrases such as forgive me Janet! or Please, tell Janet I love her. I began repeating his wifes name, and asking him to respond with how he felt. I gave him a 150 volt shock when he said good and no shock when he said bad. This test was repeated for two hours. I was pleased to find that, by the end of the experiment, there was truly a rage in the Mr. Ternbaulds voice when he repeated his wifes name."*

All four experiments were followed up by a short entry confirming that they had been arrested for murdering or injuring their wives or other women close to them. The worst was the third, by far.

*"March 1st 1954  Im quite pleased to report that the results of Mr. Ternbaulds trial were truly pleasing. I observed on the local news, that he was arrested for murdering his wife. He apparently dismembered her with a buzz saw from their garage. Police were called by neighbors who reported a woman screaming loudly.*

*When they arrived, they found Mr. Ternbauld painting the word Janet on the wall over and over in his wifes blood. What a success!"*

I wanted to stop reading after the first trial, but I couldnt. I had such a fascination with the horrible acts described within the text that I was unable to break away from. It was like looking at a car accident. It was terrible, but I just couldnt look away.

I wont reproduce all of Dr. Kalivakis writings here, but I will tell you what he wrote at the end of the study, in response to the letter I had found at the beginning of the notes.

*"I am displeased to hear that my study has been found too scandalous for the mainstream public. Although my writings will not be published, I am pleased to recount that all four of my test subjects have been deemed too aggressive and violent towards women to be integrated back into mainstream society. My third patient, Mr. Ternbauld has actually been given the death sentence for his murder. I believe that this technique can be used to create violence against any desired subject.*

*I plan on conducting further experiments on violence and rage creation. I consider this experiment to be a complete and total success."*

I didnt remove any more of the furniture from Dr. Kalivakis old laboratory. Just the thought of returning to the place where he wrote about his horrifying tests made my stomach turn. I told Skip that I was sick, and would be unable to continue clearing out the test room. He assigned another janitor to the sub-basement in Skinner hall, who was able to clear out the furniture in two or three days.

I leaned sometime after that, while moving the furniture out of the room, the substitute janitor decided he would remove the old boards that were covering one of the walls. Behind them, he found a small room with only two pieces of furniture in it  an old projector and a broken down electric chair. 

I considering switching majors after learning about Dr. Kalivakis fucked up tests. But after a relaxing winter vacation and a strenuous second semester at Winnberg, I forgot about what I read in that musty sub-basement.

I continued taking classes with Dr. Kingsman, and he became a kind of mentor for me. I ended up working on a few research papers with him and I took every class he offered. Almost everything Ive learned in college Ive learned from him. As college went on, I was able to find some more free time to have a social life. College has definitely improved for me. I was so busy with classes, friends, and work, that I hadnt thought about Dr. Kalivaki or his twisted experiment at all.

Until a few days ago, anyway.

I had been invited to go to an awards banquet with Dr. Kingsman, where one of the papers Id helped with was going to be presented. A myriad of distinguished psychologists and researchers were going to be there and I thought it would be an excellent chance to network.

The evening went very well. Our paper was received very well, and I spoke to quite a few psychologists about possible employment opportunities. After gulping down a few platefuls of cheap banquet food, I began leaving the over-crowded auditorium.

Before I could get out the door, a familiar voice called out my name. I turned and saw Dr. Kingsman standing next to an elderly man in a wheelchair

Jeremy! Before you leave, there is someone Id like you to meet!
I walked over to Dr. Kingsman and held out my hand to shake the old mans hand. Dr. Kingsman introduced me to the man.

This is Jeremy. He is one of my very best students, and he conducted almost all the data entry for the paper I was recognized for today.

I had just begun shaking the mans hand when Dr. Kingman introduced him to me. His wrinkled face remained emotionless the whole time. 

Jeremy, this man was my mentor when I was an undergraduate. Almost everything youve learned comes from something this man taught me. Youre practically one of his students! His name is Richard Kalivaki.

All of a sudden, everything Id read in that cramped sub-basement came rushing back.

I was shaking hands with Dr. Kalivaki. I was shaking hands with a man who strapped men into an electric chair and tortured them for hours.

I was shaking hands with the man who caused four husbands to violently kill their wives.

I was shaking hands with a psychopath. A psychopath who essentially taught me everything I know.

I cant get the emotionless face of that old man out of my head. I cant stop thinking of the horrible things that man did, and how theyve influenced my thoughts and actions.

But most of all, I cant stop thinking of the last sentences of Dr. Kalivakis notes:

*"I plan on conducting further experiments on violence and rage creation. Overall, I consider this experiment to be a complete and total success.*"

 Ive known Brett as long as I can remember. Honestly, hes been one of my best friends, all of my life. When we were kids, he lived just a couple houses down from me on my street. Brett and I used to hang out at each others houses all the time growing up. 

Usually, we would go to my house and play videogames on the Xbox. If that got boring, we would go to Bretts house and play pranks on his older sister. She was just a year older than us, and we loved messing with her.

I remember one time, while Bretts sister was downstairs helping his mom with the laundry, Brett and I snuck into her room, and found all her Barbie dolls. I thought it would be funny if we hid them somewhere in her room. But Brett had a better idea. He took all of her favorite Barbies, and he ripped the heads off of them. Brett thought jokes like that were funny. Bretts mom didnt think this one was funny at all. Brett got grounded for over a month, and when my mom found out what we had done, I got grounded as well. 

As we grew up, Brett and I stayed close friends. We went to the same elementary school, middle school, and high school. Even though Bretts parents moved across town when we were in second grade, they made sure Brett was able to go to the same school as me. Part of me thinks it was because I was Bretts only real friend. 

Well, his only real friend, except for Sammy, that is. I didnt really know Sammy, but Brett talked about him a lot. The first I heard about Sammy was when we were in second grade. Brett first brought him up about a week after he and his family had moved across town. He told me that Sammy lived in his new neighborhood, and that they had played videogames at Bretts house the weekend before. 

Usually, Brett only hung out with Sammy if I was unavailable. If I had to go to see my grandparents some weekend, Brett would be having a sleepover with Sammy that Saturday. If I couldnt come over to Bretts house after school, then Brett and Sammy would go down to the creek by Bretts house. I didnt really mind, because Brett still hung out with me quite a bit.

Brett had a harder time making friends as the years went on. He and I always got along great, but he never got along with the other kids at school. When we were in elementary school, it was a real problem, because Brett didnt want to hang out with anybody besides Sammy or I. Whenever I would invite him over to play videogames or watch movies with some of our classmates, he would say he couldnt make it because he had already made plans with Sammy.

Around the time that I started 5th grade, I had found a pretty good group of friends who were into the same kind of things that Brett and I were, like videogames and Pokmon cards. But no matter how many times I tried to convince Brett that he would get along well with my new friends, he refused. He said he didnt need any more friends. He told me that he didnt have anything in common with them, or that they were jerks, or some other excuse. 

One day, when I complained to my mom that Brett wouldnt hang out with anybody but Sammy or I, she told me that Brett must still be going through a rough time after his parents move. She told me that he probably needed a friend right now, and that I should be respectful if he didnt want to be friends with anyone else. She also said that I could still be friends with other people, as long as I still tried to be friends with Brett.

I was bummed out that Brett wasnt willing to make any new friends, but I did what my mom said. I stayed friends with Brett even though he wouldnt hang out with any other classmates. 
Even a couple of years later, in middle school, Brett was still kind of a loner. He and I still spent plenty of time together, but he still wasnt interested in being friends with anyone else. Except for Sammy of course. Brett talked about Sammy all the time.

At first, he just told me the same old stuff about Sammy  that he and Sammy hung out down in the creek by Bretts house, that Sammy and him were going to beat the new Halo game that weekend, things like that. But around the time we turned thirteen, Brett started to tell me things about Sammy that were disturbing. Once, during our homeroom class, I was working on a math assignment that was due during my next class period, when Brett leaned over and whispered something to me.

Sammy and I are going to skin a rabbit this weekend!

I was caught off guard by what Brett had said. What? I murmured, startled.

Shh! Sammy came up with the idea. Were going to catch a rabbit down in the creek, and then were going to kill it with a rock or something, and then were going to skin it!

I didnt really know what to say. I thought that it was messed up to kill a poor rabbit. Brett didnt really see the problem with it. He just kept saying Its not like its a person!

Over the next year or so, Brett only brought up Sammy sparingly, 
and when he did, it was always some strange thing that Sammy had suggested they do. It was usually just cruel pranks, like putting firecrackers in peoples mailboxes, or breaking his neighbors windows while they were asleep. But sometimes, Brett and Sammy did really bad stuff, like hurting and killing animals.

One day in the eighth grade, Brett came to school with a big cut in the shape of a B on his right bicep. The cut had formed a bloody scab and it was beginning to scar over. I asked him 

Whats that from?

Sammy carved it on my arm with his dads pocket knife. Isnt it awesome?

I didnt think it was cool. It scared me. 

Brett, I dont think you should let Sammy do that kind of thing to you. Its kinda weird, ya know?

Brett turned red. His brow furrowed and he turned away from me.

You sound just like my mom. Sammy said you wouldnt understand. Brett stomped away. He wasnt in homeroom that day.

After that day, Brett and I grew distant. We still hung out sometimes, but Brett didnt talk much. By the time we got to high school, I only saw Brett occasionally.

It kind of sucked, but I never thought about it much because I still ran with the same group of kids I had met in the 5th grade. I spent a lot of time with those guys, and apart from the occasional nod or wave in the halls, Brett and I didnt see each other anymore. 

About the time we stopped talking, Brett started getting picked on. I dont think it had anything to do with him and me not speaking anymore. I think some jock just noticed Brett didnt have any friends, and decided that hed be an easy target for abuse. 
Sooner or later, the whole football team started picking on Brett.

Brett wasnt really fat or skinny, and he wasnt ugly or dirty. He dressed alright, and he wasnt too dumb or too smart. Brett didnt have the usual qualities that led to getting picked on at that age. But he was quiet and pale, and he kept to himself. The football players in question took to calling him things like The Pedophile or Mr. Creeper. 

It wasnt uncommon for Brett to get the books knocked out of his hands while walking through the hallway to class. It wasnt uncommon to hear Hey, Mr. Creeper, kill anybody lately? yelled across the common area.  It wasnt uncommon for Brett to have bruises or a black eye when some asshole thought that they should show dominance.

I wish I had stepped in or something. I didnt talk to Brett back then, but I knew it was happening. I wish I had said something. I wish I had told them to stop. But kids can be pretty shitty, and I didnt want to get picked on because I stood up for him. Maybe that makes me a bad guy, but, like I said, kids can be pretty shitty.

Brett hadnt said as much as Hello to me in almost three years when he sat with me in the library. It was March, and I was trying pretty hard to pull my grades up, because I would be applying to college in the fall. I was poring over a physics lab that was due during the next period when I suddenly heard the chair across from me pull out. I looked up and the same pale face that I had spent countless hours with as a kid. He had dark bags under his eyes, which were bloodshot. 

Hey, hows it going? 

Hey man. Im good. Howre you? I feel like I havent talked to you in ages.

Yeah man, no kidding. Im doing pretty good too! I saw you sitting here, and I thought I should say whats up!

Cool. How have you been Brett? Its been so long

Bretts gaze turned away from my face, and towards the table, where he was picking at one of his nails.

Ive been okay. He laughed nervously. High school has been a little rough, but Im surviving.

I immediately felt a twinge of guilt for not standing up for him all this time. I knew what he meant when he said high school was rough. I stared quietly at my physics homework, trying to think of something to say.

I miss hanging out with you. Brett blurted out, suddenly. Brett had looked up from his hands and was staring at me. His face turned bright red, fairly quickly. 

Yeah man. I miss hanging out with you too. I dont know what happened. Life just got in the way I guess. I answered, laughing awkwardly.

Its okay. Maybe we could hang out again sometime soon, though? 

Sure Brett. Thatd be cool.

All of sudden, Brett perked up and smiled. What are you doing this Friday night? 

Uhh, Im not sure. Why, did you have something planned?

 Yeah! Sammy and I are going to this party at Ryan Ruveys house! You should come with us.

The thought of Brett attending a party was a strange one, given his loner status. What was really confusing, however, was that he claimed the party was at Ryan Ruveys house. I had heard early that week that Ryans parents were out of town, so he was throwing a huge party. But Ryan wasnt exactly Bretts friend. Ryan was one of the football players who had made Bretts high school career a living hell. I couldnt help thinking of the time Ryan had taped a white sign on Bretts locker that said Mr. Creepers fag-box. I couldnt help thinking of how Brett was almost crying as he pulled the thing off his locker while Ryan and his buddies laughed nearby.

Uhh, I didnt know you were friends with Ryan. 

Brett was still smiling  Sammy knows him! He says if I go and get to know those guys, we might end up getting along better.

I have to admit, I was a bit annoyed that Sammy had been the one to finally convince Brett to branch out and find new friends, rather than me, but I was more concerned than anything. I saw the way those guys treated Brett. I assumed they had something horrible planned for Brett and Sammy. I decided I should go with him, to make sure they were alright. 

I got the address and time from Brett, and I told him I would try to meet him and Sammy at the party. Right as Brett started to leave, the bell for our next class rang.

See you Friday, dude. Brett looked the happiest Id seen him in years.

Yeah man, see you then. I was hesitant about going to the party, but I didnt want to hurt Bretts feelings. I started to walk away from my table in the library. 

Hey August! Brett yelled, from behind me.

Yeah?

Youre my best friend, you know that right?

I didnt know what to say. I yelled See you Friday man! and walked quickly out of the library.

I wish I had said more. I really do.

When Friday came, I was growing more and more hesitant about going to the party. My concern about the joke that could be pulled on Brett and Sammy was slowing turning to concern that said joke would affect me as well. 

I still had Bretts number from when we were kids. I sent Brett a text that said:

Hey dude, Im feeling kind of sick. Dont think Ill be able to make the party tonight. Maybe instead we can hang tomorrow?

Brett replied:

 Thats ok. Lets grab breakfast tomorrow, at the Waffle House by your house?

Sounds good, see you at 12!

I felt bad for bailing on Brett, but I knew that the party wasnt going to go well. I was right.

When I saw Brett at breakfast the next day, he looked paler and more tired than he had been the other day. But he was smiling as I walked into the Waffle House. He had already gotten a table, and was drinking from a mug of coffee. As I approached the table, I could see his hands were shaking slightly, as he sipped on the coffee.

Hey man, whats up? 

Hey. Feelin better? Brett asked.

Yeah. Just a 24 hour bug, I guess. How was the party?

Brett didnt answer. He just smiled.

Was Sammy still able to go with you? I asked.

Yeah, he was there. Brett was still smiling. His eyes were bloodshot. Brett started to say something else, but we heard a car door slam outside. Brett turned his head towards the window on his left. I looked out the window and saw a Giliman County police cruiser parked neatly next to his car.

Sorry August. I guess I dont have very much time.

What?

You really are my best friend, August.

An officer had just entered Waffle House. He was quickly approaching our table, and drawing his gun at the same time. I was still processing what Brett had said when the officer grabbed my arm and pulled me to the ground.

Brett had indeed gone to Ryan Ruveys house the night before. Neither he, nor Sammy, had actually been invited. He showed up to the house, which was full of drunken football players and their friends. There was about 23 people, in all.
Nobody noticed Brett for almost 20 minutes. Sometime around 10, Ryan noticed Brett standing idly in his kitchen, right beside the beer keg, watching everyone. He yelled 

Hey look everybody, its the serial killer! Who invited you, faggot? 
Brett didnt answer Ryan. He just smiled. Brett had brought along a gun that his dad kept in their garage. Brett fired twice at Ryan, then began firing into the crowd of people. 

After Brett had expended all eight shots, he reloaded and fired eight more times. He ended up killing twelve people. The rest escaped while Brett was firing.

It took the police all night to track Brett down. I just happened to get to Waffle House a few minutes before they did.

They arrested Brett, and took us both in for questioning. Two officers questioned me extensively about Brett. I told them what I knew, and they told me what Brett had done the night before. Afterwards, they asked me if I had any questions. I did.

Did Brett shoot Sammy?

The officers looked at each other blankly. One of them quickly flipped through their notes.

No. No one reported to be at the party was named Sammy. One of them told me. 

I didnt understand. Why had Brett told me Sammy was there, if he wasnt? I told the cops that I had never met Sammy, but I had heard a lot about him from Brett.

Nobody else that the cops questioned had heard of a Sammy. 

Except for Bretts parents, that is. I was allowed to watch several police questionings, in case something I heard might jog my memory. When asked if Brett knew anyone named Sammy, Bretts parents looked confused.

Brett used to have a friend named Sammy when he was a little boy, but not since then. His mom told officers. 

The officers looked surprised. Do you have any idea where that Sammy might live now?

Bretts Mom frowned. Well no. Sammy wasnt real. Sammy was Bretts imaginary friend. He pretended to play with Sammy when he was real little. Whenever he misbehaved, he would tell us that whatever he had done was Sammys idea. We told Brett he couldnt be friends with Sammy if he was going to get him into trouble. I havent heard anything about him, since.

My heart sank when she said that. No one but me had heard anything about a Sammy since Brett was a little kid. There was no record of a Sammy living in the area around Brett. 

There never was a Sammy. All of those things that Brett did. All of the times he said he was with Sammy. He was by himself. 

I cringe when I think about Sammy. To think that Sammy was real to Brett. To think that Brett heard Sammy talking to him, telling him to do those awful things.

Brett died in jail after taking a handful of painkillers he had purchased from another prisoner. He died peacefully in his sleep. The last few times I had seen him, he looked like he hadnt slept in days. I think it was Sammy was keeping him awake. I hope he can finally rest now.

Goodbye Brett. You were always my best friend too.

 Maybe it's because I'm a college student in a town with a lot of bars, but I find this quite freaky. 




 Guess pooping is out of the question for OP now.
