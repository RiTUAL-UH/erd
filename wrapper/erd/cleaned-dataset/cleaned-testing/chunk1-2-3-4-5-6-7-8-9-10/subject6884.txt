 Nothing you are doing wrong, its the way internet is managed in china(fire-walled). Data coming in and out of datacenters in China gets bottlenecked thus slowing down the download speed quite considerably! This coupled with the fact that the fastest speeds you can get in Beijing is 2meg multiplied by the vast amount of people using the internet in Beijing equals a piss poor download speed!

 France is a country with a long history of allowing Nazis to set up puppet governments. But the rest of their history is shameful,The French under Napoleon III presented the United States with the Statue of Liberty -- an intended trojan horse ambush gone wrong. The vast majority of French men are sex addicts, in the closet and/or champagne socialists. The most common thing a frenchman will say during his life is "what proof do you have that i am full of shit"? France is most famous for enacting legislation banning women from shaving their armpits, which was then enthusiastically imported by the horrifyingly hirsute Italians.

 Thanks for all the great responses guys. I think setting up my own business would be a bit too extreme for me. I think the non-immigrant "b" approach with the visa runs sounds like the best idea. Maybe getting a TEFL before I go out is an idea. Or I could work illegally??  




 Hi guys my girlfriend has recently been given a conservation job in Thailand. I am hoping to join her maybe for as much as a year. I would like to travel a bit as well as some local employment to keep funds going. I've looked into visa's and work permits but it seems a little confusing and would like a little advise on it. I am a British citizen.

I just used a pair of sharp scissors, but apparently proper hair cutting scissors are better. You can get these 'scaredy cut' scissors for easy (and non-dangerous!) grooming....  http://www.scaredycut.com/" 




 They live outdoors. Im the UK so its not usually a problem but at the moment we are having our first summer in about 10 years. Now a/c here I'm afraid. 




 The photo makes it look a hell of a lot better than it is honestly. Just trim evenly with some scissors and be really careful not to nip their ears 




 Apparently they can die of heat stroke very easily so it's vitally important that you keep them cool in the summer months.

 That would depend on what resolution you were running it at. at 1920x1080 you'll probably be looking at about 40fps in ultra, 60+ in high

 So, earlier today, I was watching one of my family's cats hitting a cord hanging from our blinds for about 10 minutes or so, and I started thinking 'jesus, the fucking stupid animal is so damn easily amused'

And then I realised that I'd been staring at a cat playing with a string for ten minutes.

 You can set up sab to listen for .nzb's in a certain folder eg downloads, then as soon as you have downloaded the .nzb will then automatically be loaded to you queue. 









 I also thought this. Why is the bottom of the card instructing how long to wait before collecting been ripped off? But then again, this is the internet where nothing is a lie. 




 Oh right soz, I thought you had changed the font in the second image.

 I should have added that it needs to be able to pick up the 5ghz band.

 I've always prefered to connect my desktop to my router via ethernet, however currently this isnt possible. What is the best most reliable receiver on the market at the moment. It will be communicating with a Netgear Vmdg480. 




 Does this ama in anyway make up from the loss of your imaginary internet points?  














 Mein Kampf quite believe it!  




 Ever since the closure of NZBmatrix I am yet to find a new home due to the closed door approach most of the index sites are using now. If someone could help me get in to one of these it would be most appreciated.  




 **Just piggybacking this top comment so this gets seen**  

Here are some witness accounts of what actually happened .

 It happened near to me. Spurs youth lit it and threw sideways into row s. The 47 year old guy arrested was in a suit and wore glasses. The smoke bomb fell at his feet. It was horrible, my 13 year old was gagging as was everybody in the vicinity and it stung the eyes. The guy in the suit picked it up and threw it out of the way much to the relief of all those around him. After that further down someone else would have done the same to get it clear of them. They would not have been able to see where they had thrown it. IMHO neither of them should be charged or banned. They had to clear it from where they were. It was very sad that it hit the linesman but it wasn't a hooligan issue it was a safety issue. We were searched going into the ground so I have no idea how those who took it in managed to get the smoke bomb in. 

another:

 The fella who threw it on the pitch (and unfortunately hit the linesman) is a mate of mine. It originated from the Spurs fans in the upper tier and landed in the lower tier. My mate tried to lob it underarm on to the side of the pitch because the people around him were struggling to see / breathe. Unfortunately he mis-judged it a bit and hit the lino, just an unfortunate accident. Plod and the Villa stewards had a word with him and to be fair the stewards were really good, they realised what he was trying to do and told the old bill not to nick him. He was back in for the 2nd half so presumably the two they have nicked are the ones from the upper tier who threw it in the first place

 Universal Serial Butt 





























 Hi Guys,
Has anyone managed to get NFC working with a door access system? I've tried but it seems the phone generates a random hex everytime NFC is used. In order to use your phone to access a building for example this code would need to be static. Has anyone heard of any apps that do this? I have read that card emulation is build into the NFC API but as of yet I can't find anything?

 I have a set of B W Dm601 S2's that are in need of a new amp. Currently these are powered by an Nakimitchi AV-10 that provides more than enough power to drive these speakers. However this amp will now be moving to the lounge to become part of a fully fledged home cinema system.

This leaves these great speakers with nothing to power them. I'm looking for something that will compliment them well and cost under 150.
