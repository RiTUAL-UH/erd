 If you're using the Steam Community Market to ever value something then don't, it's near pointless. Unless you mean market like just in general, in which case, yeah you're good I guess. 




 How is violet so low? Honest question here, it's my second favourite and I've been able to sell them higher than any other sheen when I sell them on backpack.tf or tf2outpost 




 Owner of a Team Shine RL here, I used to have a DD sheen on one and a VV Festive one, I'm personally liking the TS sheen more than the other one, specifically on Blue. 









 I hope I win the Stout Shako :]

 Only premium players can get random crits.  
  
Your backpack must be more than 1 bud to get mini crits.  
  
If any of your classes have a Gibus, Pyrovision Goggles or Mann Co. Cap you cannot get Random Crits. 




 If I had 26 buds I would believe you, the actual trade was 1 scrap for my Quadwrangler.

 100 damage seems higher than normal, especially if it's been a solid 100 with no 99-101 just always 100. I used it in a pub today and it just stayed at 100 on everything. This seems like more than normal.

 Title. Seeing as the most important tier is OU, are they really over used? It seems like they're just being used now.  




 I would personally give myself max cash and buy all the PK gear I could, get some rare items; Phats, Halloween Masks etc, max my skills and do drop parties in the Falador room. I would also put some cash into the well of goodwill. 



















 Now don't get me wrong, Muselk is an amazing content creator and tf2 player, but does anyone else notice a huge spike in usage for Mad Milk Atomizer Scouts or Diamondback Spies? Normally when I see one of these I just let them do what they do, but when we have 9 of the same loadout on a team, it gets kinda mundane. His loadouts are for the most part relatively average, but people are taking them as being the undeniable best loadouts (Even though he says in his Soldier video that there is no best class) Has anyone else noticed the large amount of his sets in TF2 lately? 









 Feel free to yell (Voice)MEDIC! Because that's what I'm here for, to heal you in your darkest of times. If you're on full health, yell out to me anyway, an overheal is indispensable these days. (get it? Because a dispenser can't give you an overheal. I thought it was pretty funny.) If you're a Baby Face's Blaster Scout then I'll heal you in a couple of seconds, You're a pretty quick guy. If you picked up a health kit when I'm on low health then I'll give you a quick overheal and wait for it to come back, When I'm on fire and you're a Pyro, I don't hate you for not airblasting, you might not know how to do that, maybe you don't know it puts out a player, and I'm fine with that. But I swear to god if you wear a Lime Green or Pink loadout I will never heal you. Because Y'all look stupid. 









 Ahh, the age old question of 'Should I set people on fire or should I use a stick to hit people already on fire?'  
  
  
Please don't be mean to each other, be mean to the weapons 









 So tomorrow I can buy things off the market again, I'm thinking of getting an Aces High unusual (not gonna say what because I don't want somebody to buy it just to be a dick). I heard it was broken, can anyone confirm or deny this? 




 Please, pick up money when one of these two situations arise, the first one is when I, as a Scout, have passed away, think of it as my dying wish. The second time would be when you kill a robot really really far away from the big group of players.  
  
I know you're thinking 'But Scout, it's your job to pick up the money, and it helps you by giving you a huge health boost!'  
  
While that may be true, I cannot get all of the money all of the time, and the health gain, while being extremely beneficial to me, isn't always too important to me, by the time I have picked up $20, I will already be at around 250 hp, it doesn't hurt to stand on money, In fact, it probably feels good seeing as you can brag about how rich you are since you can walk on money and it probably feels really soft.

 Even though you can get unusuals, you're going to be [uncrating alot of junk] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwO8b9iq34) it's more worth it to buy a quicksell for 10 keys or even buy them from the community market, it's a waste of money to uncrate with the amount of unusuals you're not getting compared to how many you do get. 




 So I was in a little plane in GTA Online and some guy in a huge jet comes up to me and tries to shoot me outta the sky. I had my Kinect on and was going 'Come on man I just wanna fly' and he sounded like a 12 year old going 'NO FUCK YOU I'M GONNA KILL YOU' so I made an evasive move and flew directly up and he exploded. So I promptly yelled 'THESE ARE MY SKIES MOTHER FUCKER!! KNEEL BEFORE THE MIGHT OF THE CROP DUSTER!'

 So let's face it, the EoTL update was pretty overhyped for what we got, but why don't we look at the positive things we got from this year, I'll start by saying The Base Jumper is one of the greatest things to mess around with weather you're market gardening or rocket jumping or even just being a troll. What do you guys think were great things from this year? Some nice cosmetics? The BOOST you get from the Baby Face's Blaster? Or even just a tweak to an older weapon?

 They move like a texas rattle snake, they strike with no fear or remorse, they will never back down from a fight. These players are always destroying me, when I see a Heavy, it's game over. A Pyro? Dead. You could argue that I should just move away and flank them, but they will never. Stop. Coming. It's been an ordeal, especially when there's a Medic shoved firmly up the rectum of the Heavy. Does anyone else fear these... These, *monsters*?

I also have become a better Medic, the reason for this is that I know that only a skilled player could kill me with the Targe, it's really just about the confidence that I obtained when I got that kill.

So yeah if you could go ahead and answer a couple of these, mostly the first two, that'd be great 




 ??? 









 The rocket launcher mostly is based on splash damage, removed by the Direct Hit's stats, you need to literally get direct hits to do anything with that. The Grenade Launcher, however, is based on mostly direct hits from the pills. The shattering pills from the Loch aren't as bad as the Direct Hit's rockets that basically shatter on surfaces anyway.  
  
TL;DR, this isn't really that long so not reading it just kinda makes you lazy if I'm being honest, but pretty much the play style for Soldier changes to being direct rockets and Demo's doesn't because direct pills are his thing I guess. 




 My friend was playing some TF2, can't remember the map, I think it was ctf_well, and I joined on an alt account to start pissing him off by doing dumb things like whacking his sentry when I'm not an Engineer or building right next to him because he HATES that. So I'm doing that and then I guess I walked onto a metal spawn or something because he starts talking to me in the Skype about how a Soldier took his metal. So he picks up his dispenser and says "No. This Soldier is not using my dispenser." So I walk into him as a medic and start calling for a dispenser, he gets pissed and starts to call a vote kick on me, I plead in the chat and say it's my third game and that I'm sorry and I will try harder, I stay in, but he still wont let me use the dispenser, he picks it up every time and while that's happening I need to pretend to be on Reddit laughing at something. Eventually I stop and leave him be. Until a Pyro comes and sets everyone on fire including me. At that point I stood next to his dispenser spamming thanks while other people enjoy the heals. He picks it up and burns to death. I think it was worth it on his end.

 test_subject7026's Dead Ringer/Cloak and Dagger/Invisiwatch is now rank whatever.  
  
This has gotten me killed a few times and has helped me get kills a few times. Unless you have a Hale's Own, it's not a good idea to use a strange watch. 




 Can I have that script? I've started playing Medic and I feel like it would help greatly. 




 If you hit a dude like three times then he Dead Ringers it's believable  




 test_subject7026's Strange Dead Ringer has ranked up!  
  
Screw you, Valve, now everybody knows I'm a Dead Ringing bastard.  
  
If you have a Strange Dead Ringer, I'd highly recommend that you do some strange leveling for that baby. I sold mine because of it getting me killed two times.  
  
EDIT: Ok so I made a mistake in saying comp because apparently everyone knows if there's a Dead Ringer in pubs, but my point still stands for the other watches. 




 Spy is a soft counter to everything in this game, his sappers only break your guns if you're not near them or if you're dead. If you're dead then Soldiers and Demos can take it out anyway, and they can kill you easier than a Spy.  
  
I'm speaking from past experience by the way. I've hardly ever had trouble from spies. 




 I do it when I play CS:GO sometimes :] 




 I'll do my part and tell you all of my binds from f1 - f9  
  
scout is noob class he runs too fast  
soldier is noob class just shoot feet get kills  
pyro is noob class just wm1 get kills  
  
demo is noob class m1m2m1m2  
heavy is noob class click and hold for bullets  
engineer is noob class just hit sentry get kills  
  
medic is noob class don't even kill anyone  
sniper is noob class just click on heads get kills  
spy is noob class no explanation necessary  




 Can you pop with the Overdose out? Taking out the xbow is only for when you need a burst of hp you can't do with the Medigun or are at a distance. 




 Spy is removed, Spy Mains are pissed, everyone else is happy. 




 That was the intention. There's a reason I have this account. 




 So I was chilling out in Foundry having a good time when out of nowhere a bullet goes through my head and I'm like "Damn that was a good shot." And then I see who did it and go "That's probably a hacker." I came to this conclusion when I saw the Gibus. I also noticed that he was about 3,000,000 lightyears away from me when it happened, so I spectate him and I see some Sniper gameplay, now I'm gonna admit now that I like hackers. Kinda. I like seeing what they do and how proud they are of it, it's just funny to see the stuff they do sometimes, but being the good guy I am I told the server and the guy says "Nah it was just luck." to which I replied "I know what cheats look like, I know what it looks like to shoot far away from a dude and get a headshot." and he goes on his merry way chanting "Whatever bro".  
  
So we're on Coldfront now, my hands are freezing, my coffee is countering that. And then from across the map like some Robin Hood bullpoop an arrow goes directly into my soul, reaping me of all the enjoyment I had. Now others are starting to talk about it. Things are getting so heated that the snow is melting, I decide to take a few seconds to message a good friend of mine named [Max] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh1Vo6mLv0g) asking him how he feels about [hackers who deny it when it's obvious] (http://i.imgur.com/eBvudfa.png)  
  
The guy starts to get nervous at this point, almost as if I've spoken to his parents about his poor grades at school. He starts a votekick on me which fails with a final score of 2:14, he tells me that "People hack every day, get over it" and he promptly gets kicked in the nuts by everyone on the server.  
  
So anyway, what are your opinions on the Baby Face's Blaster? Do you think it's OP or just a Side Grade? 




 I like your name. That's all. I like your name.

 That is the reason I lose 20% of my 5cp matches, I want to change to Spy and sap the nest, I want to sap the 6 Engineers, but we already have 3 Spies. It's so much easier to play the game when the Spies have a functioning mouse. 




 As a vegan, these kinds of people make me want to drink a coffee and eat a steak with a side of eggs. Also I'd have a can of pepsi because that is a great drink. 




 I am known to lie from time to time, but when it comes to hats I'm an honest man :] 




 Exactly, which makes me think he got it from somebody else for some reason. I just have a strange feeling he did. They go for like 4 extra keys if they have any spec kit on backpack.tf but basic ones don't add any value really so buying one with it just seems likely. 




 Knowing is half the battle

 Granary Mid. I love Granary as a whole, but in MGE if you want to fight me you aren't going to if you want to fight in Granary Mid, I just don't like it. 




 It's got basic killstreak which makes me think otherwise, I don't know why, it just does.

 And my bow 




 The worst part is that I forgot why I reset and I played some Mannpower and long story shot I have 500 points as Spy. 




 Ruined my high score loading menu stats thing. I reset it because I was pretty mad. I had 400 points as Soldier, I know I'm good and all but I'm not *that* good. 




 /s. 




 Strange Levels are a direct rip off from Dota 2, proof being that they count things.  
  
That's what my "Inscribed Amulet Gloves of Whatever" do right? Count things and rank up? idk I never played Dota. 




 How would those even work though? 




 I also kinda thought it was ping because I don't know about that nerd stuff :] 




 Lenny faces make someone a 4channer? I better inform all those pink Snipers! 




 They probably care about this one because Wayne is #6 on backpack.tf and d0 is #50, two rich backpacks will be looked at over the thousand poor ones, I'm afraid. 




 I'm sure there will be a lobby kind of system like MvM, so playing as a team seems more than likely. :] 




 If you're on a gambling website and get salty over losing something you've got issues.

 I like the speed boost every now and again. It's also what I use in the actual game, I use MGE for practising and improving, I'm not going to use something I don't use in the normal game in MGE.

 They are way way better, which is why I don't understand the dude calling it broken, I might add that I was on Granary Mid, a small map where you can't hide and regen. 




 Sorry I phrased the thing a bit wrong, I meant you can do more depending on the situation, the situation being that the rockets are aimed around the feet and the shotgun is aimed around the chest, I've seen ~100 damage a couple times, and the rocket launcher is a very splash based weapon most of the time, the splash damage does around 80.  
  
  
The 2 hp per second saved me like twice during the fight, and half of his kills were with the Shotgun anyway. 




 Imagine someone yelling at a Pyro "THIS MEAT IS SO RARE BOBSPLOSION WOULD BUY IT!" 




 I personally love the thing (sorry /r/bisonmasterrace) but every now and again on MGE I'll get told that it "ruins MGE" and that the regen is super broken.  
  
I can see how on it's own it gives an advantage, but when they're using a Shotgun I don't see an advantage for me, they have a gun that can do more than the Rocket Launcher and think that the 2 hp per second is broken.  
  
What are your opinions on the Magic Conch? 




 I would but the guy who gave me them wants to only make profit 




 Basically, I told my friend that I'd sell his whole inventory for pure and get him exactly what he wants, he game me *150* crates. One hundred and fifty. I can't find any website that will buy them in bulk, do you guys know any sites or people that will?  
  
[This is my inventory right now. Crate city] (http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrLoak/inventory/#440) 




 Fool I wasn't talking to you, I was talking to the person being all high and mighty, I also looked at their post history, [The first post they have on /r/TheButton was 10 days ago] (http://i.imgur.com/4YsbR29.png) which shows that they most likely did not arrive on day one. 




 /u/trollabot MommyNurse2012 









 I hide mine because I am an enigma, wrapped in a mystery, I will tell anyone who asks that I did infact press the button, anybody who wants to know can know that I pressed at 60, and that doesn't make me dirty, that makes me early, I've likely been here longer than you have you dirty grey. 




 I'm jealous of all of them, mostly the Engineer. 




 You're like the kid who sits in the back of the class just to say something to prove the teacher wrong. 




 I see what you're getting at, but potentially there could always be another Burning Team Captain waiting inside that crate #4 you have sitting around, or a Sunbeams Killer Exclusive. Although it is much more likely that you would get the kritz/awp, you will 99% of the time get utter garbage. 




 I don't think a Strangifier for some weapons would be a great idea, I'm mostly saying this because a Strange Vintage would make the Stranges from earlier be less valued 




 They're too big for Mom's fridge :[ 




 Thank you for the SFM, and is that a Glengarry Bonnet I see? That was actually the second unusual I got before I cashed out and restarted. 




 [I suddenly support the idea] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GTzHd1h47o) 




 Boys, we have a traitor! 




 Too many greys are going to go for red, hey assholes! Don't press the button! Day one pressers are excusable because we didn't know what was going on, you guys know what it does. 




 Give the button the sweet release of death! 




 cunt 




 I didn't draw them but the dude who did told me the moment he gave them to me that the Heavy and Demo look like trash, he's definitely improved since he did these, I can probably get a picture of his Sniper which is actually much better. Also, who is Medli and can I kill it? 




 Do you guys want me to do this for the other 8 classes?  
  
Well probably 7, I'm not gonna list "Hudda hudda huh!"  




 Thanks for the idea. 




 I always have this fear that I will walk into it and take damage. 




 Can you remember what this particular post was? Was it a link to his soundcloud? 




 Speaking of things that include movement speed, do you ever see a BFB Scout going slow and assume it's a Spy? Because I do this way too much. 




 Ooh, dude you might want to give up on that before you get too far into it, as much as I love the idea of it, I don't think Valve would want a taunt added to the game that removes the Pyro's mask.  




 Are you the same Smithsonian that dominated like 5 people on a Sawmill game using Loch n Load? The dude who may have been you had an unusual Sober Stuntman, just wondering. 




 Be a counter to cunt a cunt 




 It sounds like the MvM spy laugh tbh 




 I don't 




 Yes! 




 I main Soldier because I have 0 skill, I just go on any KOTH map and win. It's not hard.  




 Then don't use those weapons? 




 I'd have to say the most fun weapon for me is the Liberty Launcher, combined with the gunboats you take a whopping 85% less rocket jump damage, You can take ~15 damage from 1 jump! It's so much fun to be able to use a damaging Rocket Jumper and a Direct Hit without the splash reduction!  
  
Least fun to use? I'm sorry to the people who like them, but any Sniper or Spy item annoys me and I can't find fun in them, it's such a boring way to play in my opinion, *opinion* being an important word here, I see the value of them on the team and know that they have so much power with 1 shot potential, but I hate playing as/with/against them in every way. I'm sorry I just hate them. 




 The Strange Kritz is as rare as an unusual in the latest crates, same with the AWP, they care enough to not fuck people over and also let people obtain a Kritz without opening one of the most expensive, if not *the* most expensive crates.

 I never tried Final Fantasy VIII (That is 13, right?) but I don't think I'd like it. You don't need to play a game to know it's not your cup of tea y'know?  




 The more people that press it, the less there are to press it when it becomes like red or something, how many among your tribe are longing for red? Probably like 2. 




 I love to Market Garden, but it's kinda hard when eagles are being hunted, you catch my drift?

 I became a p2p at around 500 hours, I already had like 18 hats at that point from crafting drops and some trading.  
  
I didn't really need any hats from the store, just keys baby!  
  

Also you can become some weird mix of f2p and p2p by getting traded a weapon, so that's how I became f2p2p at 150 hours or whatever.

 I was thinking link karma. Don't look at my profile for a few days. 




 I'm gonna go whore some upvotes from a nsfw Subreddit.  
  
Honestly if you're on a nsfw sub for personal reasons you're not gonna downvote are you? 




 I was gonna put it on but said "Nah I'll get downvoted, probably." 




 That's how it works? Man are my cheeks red. 




 My cake day was in April I don't know what I put on reddit lmao

 I know we have context and everything, but if we're in a "What is the most OP weapon in TF2?" thread and someone says Buff Banner then someone replies with "It's countered by the Boston Basher" the moment someone says "BB" the entire thread just stops and needs to ask.

 Disco Beat Down is probably the best effect of all time. 




 Thanks for linking me to this, but unfortunately I have a Titanium Tyrolean Miami Nights, it's funny though because the thing I want so much is a Vintage Tyrolean with Disco Beat Down. 




 I don't think anyone calls you cool. 




 Don't just give in to the haters, when haters give you lemons you know what you do? You take those lemons and squeeze them right into the eyes and scream "I DON'T WANT YOUR DAMN LEMONS! DO YOU KNOW WHO YOU'RE GIVING LEMONS TO? I AM DERPYDOSEGAMEZ, I'M THE MAN WHO'S GONNA BURN YOUR HOUSE DOWN WITH THE LEMONS! I WILL SQUEEZE LEMON JUICE INTO YOUR BURN WOUNDS!" 




 This is how you piss of multiple 7 year olds c: 




 I don't think that's a very good comparison, the issue the guy is having is that if Geel were to bet 3% of every pot he would receive 3% back because there's a 3% cut going to the site. If he puts in nothing he still gains 3% of the pot, if he puts in 3% and wins he gets it all, if he puts in 3% and loses he gets back the same value that he put in.  
  
The problem with your car example is that the salesman would not be gaining extra. I don't see a huge issue with what Geel is doing but I can see why others would. 




 Excluding keys, kinda. 




 Mine is a Disco Beat Down Vintage Tyrolean which is around 80 keys and so far I have around 30 keys towards it, I'd say a Miami Nights Titanium Tyrolean is close enough, right?  
  
Anyway, what is your dream unusual? You trying to get it with keys? Maybe on the Steam Community Market? How about PayPal trades, maybe you're doing that for it! 




 I think "Considering you died...." works just as well. Puts a bit of salt into that piss. 




 The stickies were placed, even if there were 8 they may have been all scattered. This is a complete reason for it not to go down. 




 The tf2 wiki agrees that 8 stickies will kill a sentry? Of course it will, but will it destroy them when they aren't directly under it?

 [Holy balls of all the times for this start playing from my playlist is also the time I see a post about it.] (http://i.imgur.com/etqDtZ6.png)

"I only heal good players"  
"TF2 is free to uninstall"

"Dude, you'd get a closed casket at the ugly cemetery!"  
"You're like a car crash in slow motion, it's like I'm watching you fly through a windshield"  
"You suck on ice!"  
  
I only have responses like "If you only heal good players then why do you have auto regen?" and "HAHAHA HILARIOUS AND ORIGINAL!"

 My argument is that Call of Duty is equal to a real war in terms of the graphic gameplay, and Team Fortress 2 is equal to Tom and Jerry.  
  
Team Fortress 2 is one of the most childish games around, it's a hat simulator with a few guns and swords.

 It's actually a funny story, I told some of my friends that I paypal scammed someone out of a Sulphorus Killer Exclusive because I felt like it would be something cool to discuss for a few days. So I choose some high tier yet slightly believable hats and told them I sold the KE to buy these.  
The reason I thought of doing this was because I had a 24 hour ban on backpack.tf for a price suggestion to make the Stout Shako 2 refined. Only one person knew that was the reason I was banned, it was pretty entertaining.  
  
I didn't actually paypal scam anyone and I never will, mostly because I don't have a paypal.

 God speed, Demon Hell Man. 




 Can I get a screenshot of this Gastly? Gengar is my 3rd favourite Pokmon behind Arcanine and Cinncino. 




 There are like 20 Trade Servers always available, being unable to sell there means you're a bad trader or your hat is bad, if you resort to pubs then you need to quicksell for 75% value. 




 If they have put enough time into trading to get unusuals they must have played before, if somebody only has the game for the trading, why would they go on a pub to find buyers? Why would they go into the actual game? 




 Because fuck you guys, New Zealand rules! 




 Are you saying that after maybe 50 hours someone will have 3 cosmetics for one class? Unless they got them from the store, which I doubt because unless you're very invested in a game you should not be spending $5 on it for basically no reason.  
  
What kind of trader is only in their first pub when they get an unusual? Even if they do want buyers they still have the appearance of a person who has put enough time into obtaining it. 




 That's the spooky eyes in a cloud effect right? If it is then wow man that is, like, godly for that hat.  
Although if I may add my own input here, I personally dislike the confetti effects, they aren't as visible as they should be, unfortunately. 




 Petition to change d0's steam name to "d0(   )" 




 woah Woah WOAH MAN CHILL MAN CHILL WE'RE ALL FRIENDS HERE JUST CHILL OUT MAN 




 Proud of you, man. 




 Hats do, however = More time in game = More experience.  
  
If I'm wearing an unusual people will see a man with enough investment in the game to trade up to an unusual or buy one.  
  
A Gibus just shows that you dominated another Gibus player. 




 They call me the Training Wheels, because I tend to pocket Gibus players. How can they kill something when they can't fly as demonstration man? 




 The problem with all stock is that many pro players use stock cosmetics, sometimes they use the Party Hat for some reason. 




 As someone with an unusual, I can confirm I get treated like the wooden dude from Tekken.  
That means I get my shit pushed in constantly. 




 I pocket my friends. Like 3 feet into their pockets, I almost refuse to heal anyone else unless they help build uber or have an unusual.

 For what weapons? 




 helo is me ur brother give me ur item i will hold good trade yes 




 It isn't really true like this though, Sniper can right click then left click for an instant 150 damage, killing most classes in one hit. Scout's speed is countered by the Engineer, Medic isn't the only class that can heal, you are correct in saying it is the easiest but Engineer and Heavy can do it too. There's also health kits but whatever. Being fast means nothing when you're facing a good Sniper. Healing isn't possible when you've been killed by a good sniper. Even a Heavy isn't safe if the sniper can hold his horses for a minute. 




 I would practice to do that but I main Medic and Soldier, I guess Crit Ubersaw Stair Stabs will have to do. 




 I've only been on the receiving end of this before. :[ 




 Sucks to be OP because I made it first. 




 Fun Fact, Snoop Dogg did not say "Smoke Weed Errday", it was actually Nate Dogg. Now spread that fact with all of your friends who doubted your musical knowledge.

 Das 19. Jahrhundert brachte einen staunenswert gleichen staatlichen Einigungsproze. Die deutschen Stmme einten sich im Deutschen Reich, die italienischen Staaten im Knigreich Italien. In einem Jahre, 1866, hat das Schicksal beide Vlker sogar miteinander fr ihre staatliche Neugestaltung zum Kampf antreten lassen.
Heute erleben wir zum zweitenmal diese gleichartige Entwicklung. Ein Mann von skularem Ausma hat es als Erster unternommen, der in seinem Volke unfruchtbar gewordenen demokratischen Geisteswelt erfolgreich eine neue Idee entgegenzusetzen und in wenigen Jahren zum Siege zu fhren. Was der Faschismus fr Italien bedeutet, ist schwer abzuschtzen. Was er fr die Erhaltung der menschlichen Kultur geleistet hat, liegt bei den Sternen.
Wer wird nicht niedergezwungen bei einer Wanderung durch Rom oder Florenz von dem Gedanken, welches Schicksal diesen einmaligen Dokumenten menschlicher Kunst und menschlicher Kultur zugestoen sein wrde, wenn es Mussolini und seinem Faschismus nicht gelungen wre, Italien vor dem Bolschewismus zu retten.
Deutschland stand vor dieser selben Gefahr. Hier hat der Nationalsozialismus das Wunder der Rettung vollbracht. An diese beiden Staaten klammert sich nun in der geistigen Vorstellung unzhliger Menschen aller Rassen der Glaube an eine neue Renaissance unserer Zeit.
Die Solidaritt dieser beiden Regime ist daher mehr als eine Angelegenheit egoistischer Zweckmigkeit. In dieser Solidaritt liegt die Rettung Europas vor der drohenden bolschewistischen Vernichtung begrndet.
Als Italien seinen heroischen Kampf um sein Lebensrecht in Abessinien durchstritt, stand ihm Deutschland deshalb als Freund zur Seite. Im Jahre 1938 hat das faschistische Italien uns diese Freundschaft in reichlichem Mae wieder vergolten. Mge sich niemand in der Welt ber den Entschlu irren, den das nationalsozialistische Deutschland diesem Freunde gegenber gefat hat.
Es kann dem Frieden nur ntzlich sein, wenn es darber keinen Zweifel gibt, da ein Krieg gegen das heutige Italien, ganz gleich aus welchen Motiven vom Zaune gebrochen, Deutschland an die Seite des Freundes rufen wird.
Man lasse sich vor allem nicht von jenen anders beraten, die in jedem Lande als vereinzelte brgerliche Schwchlinge vegetieren und nicht verstehen knnen, da es im Vlkerleben als Ratgeber der Klugheit auer der Feigheit sehr wohl auch den Mut und die Ehre geben kann. Was das nationalsozialistische Deutschland betrifft, so wei es, welches Schicksal ihm beschieden wre, wenn es jemals einer internationalen Gewalt gelingen wrde, das faschistische Italien, ganz gleich unter welchen Motivierungen, niederzuzwingen.
Wir erkennen die Konsequenzen, die sich daraus ergeben mten, und sehen ihnen eiskalt ins Auge.
Das Schicksal Preuens von 1805 auf 1806 wird sich in der deutschen Geschichte kein zweites Mal wiederholen. Die Schwchlinge, die 1805 die Ratgeber des Knigs von Preuen waren, haben im heutigen Deutschland keine Ratschlge zu erteilen. Der nationalsozialistische Staat erkennt die Gefahr und ist entschlossen, sich auf ihre Abwehr vorzubereiten.
Ich wei dabei, da nicht nur unsere eigene Wehrmacht einer hchsten militrischen Beanspruchung gewachsen ist, sondern ebenso auch die militrische Macht Italiens. Denn so wenig das heutige deutsche Heer beurteilt werden kann nach der alten Bundesarmee etwa in der Zeit von 1848, so wenig kann das moderne Italien des Faschismus gewertet werden nach den Zeiten der italienischen staatlichen Zerrissenheit. Nur eine hysterische, ebenso unbelehrbare wie taktlose, dafr aber hchst bsartige Presse kann in so kurzer Zeit vergessen haben, da sie erst vor wenigen Jahren mit ihren Prophezeiungen ber den Ausgang des italienischen Feldzuges in Abessinien sich ebenso grndlich blamierte wie jetzt wieder in der Beurteilung der nationalen Krfte Francos im spanischen Feldzug.
Mnner machen die Geschichte!
Sie schmieden aber auch die Instrumente, die zur Gestaltung der Geschichte geeignet sind, und vor allem, sie geben ihnen ihren Hauch. Groe Mnner aber sind selbst nur die strkste, konzentrierteste Reprsentation eines Volkes.
Das nationalsozialistische Deutschland und das faschistische Italien sind stark genug, um gegen jedermann den Frieden zu sichern oder einen von unverantwortlichen Krften leichtfertig vom Zaun gebrochenen Konflikt entschlossen und erfolgreich zu beenden!
Das bedeutet nun nicht, da wir Deutsche  wie es in einer verantwortungslosen Presse jeden Tag geschrieben steht  einen Krieg wnschen, sondern es bedeutet nur, da wir
1.                  das Verstndnis dafr haben, da sich auch andere Vlker ihren Anteil an den Gtern der Welt sichern wollen, der ihnen kraft ihrer Zahl, ihres Mutes und ihres Wertes zukommt, und da wir
Danken wir Gott, dem Allmchtigen, da er unsere Generation und uns gesegnet hat, diese Zeit und diese Stunde zu erleben.

 nope dont see a medic anywhere i am a simple sandwich 




 Nobody else was playing Medic. 




 DR isn't that good though, especially against Soldier, Heavy, Pyro and Anyone using Melee. Soldier can see the Cloaked Spy with the splash of his RL, Heavy can keep firing and see the Spy because when taking damage the Cloak fades a little bit, Pyro just because Pyro, Melee is very easy to use to track spies if you hit them once, you keep walking into them and wail on them. 




 Combat Medic is so appealing because of what's called "The Medic Effect" which is absolutely not real. What it is is that people don't see a Medic as a threat so they wont target them. **Haha** Also people think killing a real Medic as a Combat Medic is impressive. **Hahaha** 




 The Rocket Launcher has 4 rockers that can do damage *without* directly hitting the player! That's so unbalanced! And don't get me started on ubercharge, invincible for 8 seconds!? That's so powerful and stupid.

 If he's new to Sniper there's Bootcamp, there's no defending him here, he probably yells at 1 tour players to go to Bootcamp anyway. 




 Medic is like the hardest class in MvM what are you on about? Soldier and Demo are the easy ones, even Scout if the rest of your team can keep all the robots in one place. Medic has mechanics of the Shield and the Revive that new players need to learn, even Heavy is easy.  
Medic is the single hardest class if you are new, I even main non MvM Medic and had issues with it.

 There was an issue with someone getting access to my account but valve fixed it by doing some magic not really important, but he spent money from the card on my steam account, so Valve with their infinite wisdom reset my inventory to before any transactions happened, including mine, I lost any items modified including my 50 tour badge.

 Very simple premise, start with whatever you want, but the moment you get killed you must switch to that class and only use the weapon that killed you.  
Did you just get killed by the Eyelander? You Now are forced into the Eyelander until you die, at which point you switch to whatever killed you.  
  
You are allowed to use items that aren't in the same equip slot, for example the Tide Turner/Wee Booties or a Soldier backpack.  
  
Have fun letting Rockets kill you so you can use rockets.  
  
Also you should use the Auto Buy thing from scrap.tf before you do this, just to make sure you can use all the items you need.

 "If the Buff Banner got nerfed..." Doesn't look like a pun set up at first glance, it appears to be a discussion of sorts, I expected something about MvM to be a hot topic for that thread, but no, it's a pun.  
"Scout seems to enjoy break dancing. You could say..." does seem like a pun after reading it, but I originally saw it as a possible discussion on many things, from an SFM of Scout breakdancing to a mod to make every class dance.  
Knowing how many puns are on this sub, I saw "Why don't snipers use jarate all that often?" and assumed it was a pun.  
"The Medic knew taping together his broken mug wasn't the best idea... " is the only one I knew for a fact was a pun instantly.  
These aren't always optional to click or not click with the knowledge of them being puns. 




 It's better to have them there than have them here. The puns are killing this sub they can go beat a dead horse all day. 




 Oh boy do I have some  
Kicked for Racism (I called the admin a moron and apparently that's a racial slur.)  
Kicked for using bitch weapons (Direct Hit)  
Kicked for Pubstomping (I like using Kritz, sue me)  
Kicked for hacking (Dindu nuffin)  
Kicked for hacking ("Become satisfactory, obtain hehehecube")  
Kicked for hacking ("Dude this sniper... Hackey McGee over there.) 




 Short Circuit is the only one of those that is a *hard* counter.  Spycicle is easy to deal with, just keep wm1ing for two seconds and you'll probably find it, Pyro isn't even the only counter, Soldier's splash can reveal a cloaked Spy.  
DDS just means you need to wait for a second to shoot them, Sniper isn't the hard counter to Sniper, it's Spy.  
Amby.

 If we can have everything by this guy added, that would be great.  









 On the bright side, I can get easy karma from nsfw subs. You don't get downvoted there, it's great. 




 It makes Projectiles useless. Demoman gets fully shutdown by a good Pyro. Soldier with Gunboats is screwed, Engineer can be stopped if he's Rescue Wrangler. It's a part of the game that with skill counters any skilled or unskilled players, spend 20 hours practising Airblast and you just stopped Soldiers and Demos from touching you. 




 As a Red Medic, suck it nerd lol red 4 life 




 [](#flair "request")
 




 The problem with that is, you'd need to give damage falloff to the stock, which it does kind of need, but it would change Demo drastically if he wasn't a direct pills only kind of guy. If there was an added Grenade Launcher with +projectile speed and -something I would use the hell out of it, I like hitting shots more than killing, it just feels better. 




 To quote my Key Pad 5 bind; "Fuck people who airblast"  
Also RS has like no skill required, it's somehow easier than wm1. 




 Unless it's a Gunslinger/Kritz, I put my Team Shine/Flames on a vintage Kritz because I don't have 28 keys to throw around. 




 Kill me now. 




 I'm so sorry for you, somebody showed me a pro ks unique bersaw and I cried. 




 I agree with you, but it may be a problem. 




 Whether it be 'Sappers now recharge like in MvM' or 'RD_Asteroid removed' or even 'Sniper and Spy removed due to complaints about being annoying', what patch notes would be perfect for you and what would make you switch to CS:GO?

 "Pringle is a bad Soldier."

 As a Medic main, I never use the Gunslinger unless I undergo surgery to become a Texas Rattlesnake. 




 I meant three seconds in general being a game changer, I can see where my miscommunication could be a bit of an issue or whatever though. 




 Hard Countering Snipers isn't that bad when you consider that Sniper hard counters Medic/Engineer/Scout/Non-DDS Snipers/Uncloaked Spies. Then you give Sniper a bottle of Piss and the Bushwhacka and he counters anyone that feels like whipping out the Melee of their choice for a friendly game of "Let's fight with swords n shit".  
  
Vaccinator isn't even that good anyway so it basically *only* counters Sniper in that regard, denying Kritz doesn't deny damage. Just shoot an extra rocket at the nerd and he's gone. Use some communication to tell your team that the other Medic has Vax and then wait for the Med to go down before popping your Kritz.  
  
It's not bullshit to good players, only bad players have issues with enemy gamers using this. For example; You. 




 You say that now but it takes like 3 seconds for a Scout to cap last on most 5cp maps. 




 I think  
bind [key] +reload;-reload;+reload;-reload  

Might work, but I'm terrible with binds so it probably wont. 




 So you're saying it's better to play without 6 people?  
  
It's not even everyone doing their own thing, they all work together on the smaller bots and have individual strengths.  




 Does this really counter hackers? This seems more like it's just a way to counter Sniper in general.

 This is what love is. 




 Demo still has an easier time, and he has splash damage against the bots. Demo takes less skill making it easier to play. Why do people want to break the meta so much? It works as well as it needs to. 









 This happened to me yesterday but I was a Soldier doing sick jump n shoots.

 Caber isn't a weapon.  
  
Nice joke, very funny.  
The Skullcutter is the best Melee weapon for Demo in the game if we assume that the Caber is not a weapon. 




 Caber should be banned. Screw that thing. That much damage from a Melee is too much. And I main Direct Hit Soldier, I know when a weapon is overpowered. 




 I have Mouse Wheel Up bound to my Primary, Mouse Wheel Down bound to my Secondary and Q bound to Melee, you might want to do something like that if you use the Zatoichi, it's been useful to me alot.

 "How did you do that?" My mother asking how I went shiny as dentist. 




 Sniper can do his job better, Demo can do Snipers job + Demo's job of the tank. Soldier needs the Buff Banner to give extra damage for the team. Engineers goal is make sure his buildings stay up and bait sentry busters.  
  
The meta is the best way to play because it is the fastest and easiest way to play for the most part of the game. I said it before and I'll say it again, The gamemode and the meta are like 2 years old I shouldn't need to explain this. Look at Google. 




 **Damge falloff** 




 Reddit doesn't like these kinds of comments, it's like 'Nice work, upvoted!' or 'Happy cakeday!', it doesn't contribute hugely to the conversation. I don't understand this website. 




 "Selling Dead Presidents Berliner's Bucket Helm 15 keys pure" would sound pretty strange. Buy my hat. I hate this thing buy it. 




 Dude, an unspoken rule of Reddit is that if you get downvoted by more than -5 points, you're probably wrong. You're just digging a deeper hole of losing comment karma. 




 I think the Cloak then Jarate through the crack really sells this. 




 A combination of both, every class has a specific role to fill and can fill it perfectly. Scout does the best job at making giant robots easy to kill and can collect money, Valve even made the Scout the money class by giving him health for collecting cash. Soldier gets easy damage and can work crowd control + the tank, the Buff Banner allows for extra damage on everything. Demo can kill uber Medics by right clicking. Heavy is just a Heavy, easy damage. Engineer kills anything not hit by the players with his sentry. Medic has a shield that prevents all incoming damage and has Kritz for easy kills.  
  
The gamemode and the meta are like 2 years old I shouldn't need to explain this. 




 There's a difference between worshipping it and knowing that it is the best way to play, it has been shaped over the time of MvM to be perfect for getting through the missions with the least amount of trouble. 




 I completely agree with you there, but outside of the job it does have it's about as useful as glass doors on a Submarine.  




 [I bet you were laughing your ass off when those bans happened] (http://spinoff.comicbookresources.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/dwaynejohnson.jpg) 




 It's overpowered on defence, as said before by /u/moodRubicund, you get pure dominance over an area, however, it's a borderline horrible weapon otherwise. 




 That Pyro is a Spy! 




 Fun Police engineer usually uses the Pomson. But in this situation I'd say the Pyro wins. 




 Smoking is very easy to see, but I find it hides your face if you have it low, I'd recommend Steaming over Smoking but that's just me. 




 None because SV_Pure sucks ass. 




 Meanwhile, Max Box is aimbotting with an Aussie Minigun. 




 Ah, piss tits. 




 It's better than the puns. 









 Why should I? The meta is solid. 




 The loot is cool and all, but I can finish a mission with a good team in less than 30 minutes, playing with hackers is much easier, but I don't rely on it. The time it took to beat it was still about 30 minutes.  
Playing a tour with players who know what they're doing is almost the same level of skill for me as playing with hackers, all I had to do was collect money and watch, that's my job anyway.  
The loot was not the primary reason for me staying. 




 It's like stickies, I ask first.

 My actual responses are much cooler than that.

"How can you come on to a Valve server and think there are plugins? They are very clearly organised by Alphabetical order, y'know A B C D-" Then I do the rest. I know they're probably orded by ping or players, but this is a Nic Cage quote so it's more embarrassing for them.  
omg why isn't rtd working  

I stole the declaration of independence and it said in the fine print that !rtd is only to be used while not in use of other players.  
  
I use these kinds of responses when I'm named 'Nicolas Cage' which is 30% of the time.

 Pop uber when in danger  

I'm telling you to pop uber when in danger.  




 That website is poorly designed. 




 Pop uber when in danger. Keep the uber when you're not popping on a player. If you aren't ubering a player your uber was bad, and poor team coordination was probably a factor. 




 Don't judge me I was drunk and it was like 2 am I can't do math.  
Also that's a waste of an uber if you're the only one there.  




 It's a poorly written pornographic anime about a guy who sees a young girl but SUPRISE it's a young boy. Like a 10 year old boy. They fuck in the back of a car, then the first kid sees another kid and they watch the second kid's sister use a banana for something other than eating, then they fuck in the attic. Then there's a transgender kid or something and they all fuck on top of a tower.

 Check how many people are dead, if it's not many you go to the field, but with 5 dead, you need to sit and wait. Also check the classes dead and alive, if there's a Scout down you should start to leave, you will be outrun unless they are BFB or you are Quickfix meaning you won't give them the full buff of hp when they're at the fight.  
  
I personally pocket my friend because I know he's good, so I sit and wait for him. In a game without a friend to work with you should normally be going to the fight.  
  
 




 Not everyone is enjoying them, not only do they make people wish a swift death would come upon everyone involved, they make what looked like a legitimate discussion turn into a load of comments that are either "Boooooo!.png" or something like mine.

 You shouldn't really be shooting so much that you hear it, only when the person you're healing dies or you are really in danger should you be firing to damage people. 




 Sorry about the "suck ass" thing but but that's just the way I speak and I write how I talk most of the time. 




 So like  
bind mouse4 "cl_yawspeed 1000"  
bind mouse5 "cl_yawspeed whatever the default is"? 




 Kill a Medic in one hit use the other two to kill the Soldier or Demo, if it's a Heavy you're screwed, but you can still kill so much with that. Reloading is also a thing that happens. 




 The worst part is that it exists. 




 You know how some weapons reward skill? This and the Frontier Justice are not those. Backstabs are easy and frustrating, sapping is also easy, I have farmed Diamondback crits from a BONK! Scout and it sucked. Same with FJ kind of. 




 I like my Strange Pocket Heavy because I named it after the Heavy main I'm friends with. I also have a Rocket Launcher that says he's bad. 




 Can you give me that script, a have a Pybro who I'd love to be more useful to me. He's good but I've seen him get backstabbed way too much. 




 Guys just grab the Overdose, it may be a piece of trash but if you just killed a Scout or something with the Ubersaw and you're at 100% all by yourself, you can run slightly faster to get to a team member to heal them. The damage penalty is like 10% which is maybe 3 hp per syringe, I wouldn't know because I use the Crossbow, but it's so much better than the stock and the Blutsager. 




 There is a dead subreddit made for these, go revive it.

 I used to use it to get better fps, I stopped using it because of people saying "Yo dude check out this corpse it is flipping out." 




 I don't know why this is making me laugh so hard. 




 It wasn't banned before that? It one shotted classes sometimes, how do you not ban that? Isn't that why my precious Direct Hit is banned?  
Edit: DH isn't actually banned, a lime scout told me it was. Probably because he doesn't like getting 1 shotted.

 I think that's what makes people call you a scrub, the more damage you do the more salt you spill.

 It needs a buff. It *currently* can't random crit which is a very bad stat to have, if they removed the no metal from dispensers part the weapon would be viable, it should also have Widowmaker type stats where dealing damage returns metal.  
  
If those stats got implemented then the SC would be good.

He talked shit about hats. Downvotes are expected here.  
He used the term 'retarded' which is an insensitive term in most cases, including and especially when it comes to hats.  
And then there's a comment with upvotes because he was correct.  
  
There are comments with ~-30 points, while the other ones have ~-5. If people truly did downvote all his posts there would be more consistent negative comments.  
  
He even asked why something was being downvoted when clearly it was because he claimed to be able to "jump into any online fps and not be a noob" and that "not everyone starts out a noob" which is one of the stupider things I've seen there.

 meh 




 Wow great job you wrote *plan* instead of *play* you had one job and you ruined it. 




 I'm not gonna lie, I'm using this sub for link karma and boy is it working! http://i.imgur.com/rVKWz4m.png

 If the Blu team doesn't see you get up there then you can get an easy like 5 kills, I need to try this spot out. 




 God I love the Direct Hit. 




 [Kritzkreig BONK!] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K56soYl0U1w) 




 I started playing CS:GO a few days ago...  
"Thomas are there spies here? I think I bumped one."  
"Something something Ambassador bullshit something headshotting."  
"AWPer Hand is nowhere near this good dude, Valve should buff the shit out of this."  
I think I yelled "BONUS CHICKENS" when I saw that chickens give you 1 point. 




 Can someone explain to me why no headshots is even on the CC as a downside? Aren't downsides meant to be downsides from the stock?  
Also where is the Overdose, that thing is great.  
  
  

Crusader's crossbow isn't that offensive and the bullets don't heal
all that well either.  

Let me stop you right fucking there. Medic is a Medic. Medic is a healer, not a fighter.  
You aren't meant to heal with the bolts more than the Medigun, it's for distance healing, fire it into a Soldier on low hp from a rollout and he can jump to wherever you are to get healed from the Medigun. 




 Cream Spirit is both, just get that. 




 The fact that it's a pub. 




 I want to make a joke about the dude who uses this sub named Frontier_Justice, but I have no jokes left. 




 Play MvM as like Scout or something until you get some tours under your belt. I know that I, along with most of the other MvM players would see a 0 tour Spy and tell you to go Heavy or get kicked.  
  
Spy isn't that good for MvM anyway though.
 




 Well for that Pyro to exist there needs to be a Demo who also never misses. I know the Loch is easy to hit with, but let's assume there's a pro Pyro and a pro Demo who aren't robots.  
  
The Demo shoots one pill that gets reflected, then he hits the Pyro with the second pill, then he misses the last one.  
  
Loch takes a small amount of skill to aim but that doesn't mean it always hits. Even a Scout can counter the LnL by jumping, Medic as a whole counters Loch due to overheal which doesn't seem to exist in discussion.  
  
Yes the Loch does need a nerf, no the loch is not horribly overpowered.  
  
Also it's like 2am for me so that's why my structuring for this reply is probably trash. 




 The kids found you, look out! 




 The reverse is worse. Trust me I've seen my Nazi friends die from sneaky french man too many times. 




 This is a pretty shitty rename if I'm being honest. It's also very unoriginal.  




 I'm a pretty good Pyro, I've reflected Crusader's Crossbows and Flares, Loch n Loads are very easy to reflect. I'm not even a great Pyro and I can reflect extremely fast projectiles that go faster than the Loch n Load.  
  
There are people much much better than I am who can reflect Loch pills by looking at them. 




 You have computer AIDS, remember those naughty sites you visited? They gave you computer AIDS.

Ok cool see ya later.

 Your previous works are amazing, possibly around the 5th best I've seen on this Subreddit.  
  
If you could make a Soldier with the Direct Hit getting a sick airshot wearing an Australium Gold Ground Control, Lord Cockswain's Novelty Mutton Chops and Pipe, Deep Commitment Coldfront Curbstompers, and Lieutenant Bites.  
  
I would be extremely happy and probably scraptip you because for some reason I can't withdraw my scrap.

 Hah, joke's on you! I use all of these bar the Market Gardener and Shitty Medic, enjoy being killed in MGE daily! 




 Let me stop you at Direct Hit. First of all reflecting rockets is already extremely easy, the only time the reflecting is hard is when the Soldier is standing right infront of you, if reflecting DH rockets is so hard you're probably bad at reflecting in general.  
  
Secondly, people use it for the denial of Rocket Jumping and the Instant Kill potential on 125 HP classes. 




 Wuh- What th- 'Yes' What the hell does that mean? This isn't a Yes/No question I'm asking which one it is! What the hell are you talking about!? 




 You mean the Original or the Stock? 




 I think /r/tflewd allows fanfic, as long as it's sexy. 




 YES!  
  
Sorry, I was picturing the [Gendo Train.] (http://imgur.com/lsoomRq)  
  
Sorry. 




 Direct Hit Soldier for me, I cannot aim with The Stocket Launcher, I just can't use splash effectively. 




 What does HMB mean exactly? All I can find are workout supplements.  :[ 




 Internet fluid container? 




 [ye] (http://i.imgur.com/XMfPgVr.jpg) 




 Now that you mention it, that is pretty interesting. The same principle almost applies in pubs, people would probably be running Stock or Kritz because they are the most effective in the hands of good and bad players, but the Vaccinator is horrendously bad in a bad players hands and a good player would be using Stock/Kritz because they are more effective.  
  
Also the player they uber gains more out of those ubers I guess. 




 To be fair, if your team is good enough you shouldn't need to revive that much. 




 I discussed and used one insult at the end to drive home my point. So now allow me to retort. *Moron.* 




 Direct Hit, I got so good with it that people get mad at me for using it. Maybe if they stopped lining their Gunboats with salt and tried walking instead of jumping at me they could have used sugar instead. 




 It was an insult. I insulted you. Now here you are trying to act like you're the top dog of the internet because my insult hurt you deeply. 




 I can airshot, but only in the rhythm of the song I'm listening to. It's like walking to the beat of a song but instead of looking dumb I look awesome. 
























 What's up? 




 Double comment! :O 




 Double comment! :O 




 My mouse sometimes scrolls further than I want it to, does that mean I should be punished for not spending extra money on a good mouse? 




 Do you have them set by class? Do you put all your super cool Aussies and unusuals on page one? Maybe you have all of your stranges on one page and hats on another?  
  
I'm about to try to organize my [badly sorted] (http://backpack.tf/profiles/76561198049118645) backpack and want to look at some backpacks to get an idea of some ways I could set up mine.  
  
Thanks in advance I guess :] 




 I think I've used 2,147,483,647 on this sub at least 10 times. 




 Nah just make the hitboxes bigger and then people won't be staring at them for 5 seconds. 




 *Please note: I am only including deaths that are specific, so no "Killed by Scout" or anything of that nature.*  
  
**Times backstabbed**: 14  
**Times headshotted**:17  
**Times airshotted**:2  
**Times Reserve Shootered**:1  
**Times Flarepunched**:4  
**Times killed by environmental hazards (Sawblades, Train, etc)**:2  
**Times airblasted into hazards**:2  
**Times killed trying to pick up somebody else's gun**:2,147,483,647  
  
So yeah if Valve could increase the size of the guns when trying to pick them up that would be sweet. 




 The good outweighs the bad though.  
Let's imagine a new weapon that can do 300 damage as it's only upside, but it has much less ammo, much less speed, and some other downside.  
The upside on that is a hugely overpowered damage buff with some downsides that don't even matter.  
  
Now we can apply this to the loch.  
Upsides of faster speed, more distance, and more damage to Engineer crap.  
The downside of less ammo in the clip doesn't matter because the extra distance means you can sit back and fire from a distance and reload.  
The extra speed makes it much easier to hit *direct* shots on one person making the lower radius not matter at all.  
The lack of rollers doesn't matter much anyway, those are mostly for taking out nests which you can do easier with the extra damage to buildings.  
  
Loch isn't overpowered anymore but that doesn't mean it's bad. 




 Sounds like you got Puff n Stung, son. 




 The cases weren't dropping so to fix this another contract was given out to let people who already did the contracts for this week could get a case.  
  
Sorry if this has already been said but I don't want to read through 198 comments to check. 




 Wow that's the first time I've ever had somebody say that to me, you're such a funny guy!

 Maybe it belongs in a Muslim's butthole or something?

 Twice a week I think. 




 Only Medics that didn't get an bersaw yet used that thing before, Valve's just letting Medics get better. 




 Use a skill based weapon? 




 If you throw a killstreak kit or some other modification like a name/desc tag then the stock becomes tradeable. 




 Lookadaflickadawris! 




 It's worse than the can of Pepsi that's been sitting on my desk for a week. I used to want to drink it but now it's something I want to throw out. 




 I don't mind paying for the challenges or anything, but from what I read they're weekly for three months. I'm not math master but that's probably like 10ish drops.

 "Better sarcastic than stupid" would be another way to put it I guess. 




 Buddy you did a double post, you should probably delete the one I didn't reply to so people can see your original post. 




 Yeah yeah whatever who cares, I don't see any hats in here... 




 Here's how I deal with hackers.  
  
Complement the hacker like "Yo dude those Amby shots are on point, do you play CS:GO or something?" or "Duuuude you are amazing" because then they're like "Oh thanks man really means alot to me." and then I say to the team chat "Lmao that dude is hacking."  
  
Then I say "Hey I got a pizza on the way so I'm gonna leave now, peace out." and leave the hacker to do his thing.  
  
You really can't do anything about them but leave and they mostly want to get reactions of rage, so being cool, calm and collected about it and leaving for a different reason than "AY FUCK THIS GAME I HATE YOU LMAOBOXING FUCKS" doesn't give them the satisfaction of a reaction.  
  
Or since LMAOBox is VAC undetected I use my own VAC...cinator. Throw that bad boy onto my homeboy Pringle and let him go to town with some 1337 AWP skills. 




 The first one is probably Baby Face's Blaster, the second one is probably me torrenting anime while I play because nobody can hit you when you do that, permacrit doesn't work on any hacks that I'm aware on, those Snipers are just shooting you when your head pokes out.  
  
This isn't CSGO you can't shoot through walls. 




 Why do so many people use the Pain Train? It's garbage on Soldier.  














 Oh yeah that's the problem, it's to combat phishing bots.  
If you're like 13 or something just ask your parents if you can put $5 on your Steam account, if you're old enough to have your own credit card then throw down some cash and you can start looking cool as hell with your new hats.

 If you want karma go to a porn subreddit. 




 I'd say you should give it away here or /r/randomactsoftf2, I wouldn't recommend scrap.tf because I've heard that there are bots that auto enter all the raffles and then give all the winnings to their mains.  
  
You could also do contests for some of the items, maybe the person who can get a strange to the highest level first or something gets to choose an item.  
  
Also you probably shouldn't give that Max's head away for free unless you're feeling very nice, that's like an $80 item.

 omg never knew 




 I don't know why these two weapons get such a bad wrap together, +2 hp per second is laughable when you consider that he's losing a Shotgun, +15 hp on hit is a fair balance for losing a shot. How is basically +17 per hit broken?  
  
It's maybe +21 hp back between the time it takes for you to hit him again, it's really not that big a deal. 




 Big Black Cock Soldier? 




 Google tf2mate.  
  
It will help greatly for this and help even more if you want your crosshair to change on different weapons.  
Also if you use a laptop or low end pc then you can lower your graphics to trash tier for higher fps.

 There aren't really many mods that can make your game look better, I guess you could use tf2mate and choose the movie settings for the best visuals.  
  
Mods are mostly disabled in Valve servers though. 




 It's much easier to hit with this thing but people don't use it because splash is too good. I just like to play my game like I'm always in a frag video so I need to hit airshots all the time. 




 The masturbating or filthy franking? 




 Filthy Frank is like masturbating, you can do it alone and feel great, but I don't want to watch you do it. 




 If it were in the Soldier's voice there's a high chance it would be trash tier, there's a parody of that Mulan song somewhere and it is basically my name.

Gib Kills on guns that gib, Critical Kills on weapons that I feel will crit often like a melee or something, or if it's something else I'll go for Damage Dealt.  
  
I don't know if Loose Cannon can gib or not so whatever I guess.  
I'm pretty sure Double Donks counts as 1/3 strange parts so if it does go for Players Hit and Damage Dealt. 




 This is even worse than a Lime Scout, honestly I've had some some good times with Lime Scouts but this guy looks like a total wannabe that's also a buzzkill. 




 I've watched LMAOBox streams and been to the fourms a few times, apparently every copy of LMAOBox is different and that's why it's harder to find. Even if Gabe Newell himself decided to buy 30 copies of LMAOBox to shove into the VACBox they'd just be banning the versions they got.  
  
Imagine going to the beach and knowing that every grain of sand is unique (They aren't really but pretendsies) and that it's your duty to make sure that all the sand vanishes for your master plan of crashing a plane.  
  
You create a machine that can take something, scan a large area for copies of that thing and it will *poof* remove all of them.  
So you use it on a grain of sand and direct it at the beach. But nothing happens because they're all different apart from maybe 7 grains that are very similar.

 If you are good at the game you can counter the thing that is easy to do for other players. Gunslinger is a simple "Press 4, then 1, then mouse 1. Get kills." type of thing. If you need to be good to beat something a bad player can do it's unbalanced.  
  
[Here] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EitZRLt2G3w) is a video which talks about balancing for skill, something Valve can't do very well.  
  
Valve seriously hand the game over to this subreddit we'll take care of it like it's a newborn child.

 I'm sure that this is just something in my settings but I can't see both of my effects at the same time, [here's how I see it] (http://imgur.com/a/Rs4xZ). it's like that post a few days ago about the Sight for Sore Eyes and Fillamental doing the same sort of thing with the stacking, but I know that having both storm effects does exist because I've seen it earlier today somewhere on Youtube.  
  
If anyone could shed some light on what settings I need to screw with to fix this I would be extremely grateful. 




 A while ago friend of mine got scammed out of his unusual and I managed to get the scammer marked on pretty much every trade site, my friend got some compensation from a couple guys who heard about it. He showed me the items he got back and it added up to around $85, considering that he got scammed out of a $50 unusual he was pretty happy.  
  
Those items now reside in my backpack because I bought his backpack but they live on through me I guess.

 Scouts are very annoying, but you need to remember that they tend to earn the kills they get by shooting you and then talking whatever shit they want, they did outskill you to get the kill, maybe they got lucky but when you compare that to a Spy with 300 ping running around going "trickstabed noob" after a facestab a Scout seems like a blessing. 




 I went to the New Zealand Comic Con today and saw someone with a Gibus on, I wish I took some pictures but my phone is bad so I didn't. But yeah it was a Sniper holding a Huntsman with a Gibus on, not sure if he had Pyrovision or not. 




 "Jack what is this?"  
  
-Me, back when I started playing. 




 Where's the *"I only really like Borneo can I vote to just keep that one?"* option? 




 I mean I guess, but the Huntsman goes faster than Sonic the Hedgehog in the green hill zone with a hitbox bigger than... Something big. The hitbox for the Huntsman is big enough to score headshots without aiming much and does 360 damage from a second of drawing the arrow compared to 150 from a Quickscoped Headshot.

So yeah what season was that? 









 I'd say blame the music industry, sometimes people listen to Death Grips while playing Medic. 




 How can you claim to not use OP weapons and use the Huntsman over the Stock Sniper?  




 But that means the Medic needs to go to those paths and ditch the rest of his team.

 Never heard that before  




 I'd want a Scout, specifically b4nny.

[This is extremely ugly.] (http://i.imgur.com/0qCiksR.png) 




 I have 8,000ish on my Minigun, almost Hale's Own.  
Rocket Launcher on like 3,000 and Direct Hit on like 4,000.  
  
[If you want to see the exact numbers you can look on the first page here.] (http://backpack.tf/profiles/76561198049118645) 




 I gave someone the achievement once and was like "Only 50?" because he was [this] (http://i.imgur.com/BqvsX4E.png) kind of guy, I don't remember the actual hats he had but there was a burning Shako and either one of the all class miscs or a Soldier's Stash.  
  
Either way he looked rich, so he probably just trades alot but still I got the 50th backstab on a rich guy. 




 The shoes? 




 I know, that's why it looks bad, but just saying it's bad and therefore ugly is like saying "I enjoyed this movie" is the same as "10/10". There's no reasoning behind why you enjoyed and rated the movie so highly.  
  
I could have just said 'It looks bad and is ugly" but that's not explaining *why* it looks bad.  
  
Ugliness isn't just looking bad, it's *living* bad.   
[My friend Spongebob said it best.] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N0yXGVWS1Y)  
  
If something wants to be bad it needs to be open for criticism, just look at that movie Quarantine, it's an awful version of something good, just like the Bazooka vs The Stocket Launcher, I'm not going to go any deeper into this but basically America took the movie [REC] and made it ugly, an American took the Stock RL and made it ugly.  
  
The [duct tape] (http://i.imgur.com/boQuHqI.png) is still awful so I'm glad it gets held behind me. 




 I've done the same many times, (I just want an unusual not gonna lie.) at one point I straight up said "I've reported like 12 bugs yo just give me a hat already lmao" when I was reporting a way to remove the trade restriction using the market. 




 That looks like a DBD Attendant, did you see a Pyro with a DBD Little Buddy on that round of Snowplow? I swear I remember seeing someone with your hat combo and tried to do a high five for being Disco Bros.  
  
rest in peace me getting backstabbed before ^^possibly you could slap my hand 




 I think this also fixed a glitch I was having with the Hitman's Heatmaker, I had to turn off auto reload or the bar would go off instantly on a kill. 




 mini sentry a shit 




 It's fully understandable and after reading it myself I can see how it could have been interpreted. 




 Woah that is actually pretty cool. But yeah if you plan on getting a hat that you will wear most of the time, always see if there's a strange version.  
  
Personally I don't do this because I'm that guy who has unusuals all over the place. And I guess I did get a Unique Lone Survivor instead of strange just yesterday but that's besides the point.  




 The Beggar's Bazooka not only looks like shit but takes a shit on players. This horrendous pile of trash has dropped too many ubers while looking worse than ramen noodles thrown onto bread with butter. (But for real noodles in bread is SO good but looks awful.)  
  
[Look at this thing.] (http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/777183914644516158/36652D6B073BF227551DFA753D64AE7262DDF5EB/) What is the appeal for the design? "Yo guys have you ever wanted to take the normal rocket launcher, and throw garbage all over it!? Well for only $2.49 USD this can be all yours!"   
  
Let me break down this item for you.  
Starting at the back we have [this] (http://i.imgur.com/LJQLuer.png), it's the missing piece of the [Stainless Pot!] (http://tf2wiki.net/ww/images/thumb/b/ba/Soldiertinpan.png/200px-Soldiertinpan.png)   
And then that Pot Lid is DUCT TAPED ONTO THE ROCKET LAUNCHER.  
  
Now we can move past the only thing keeping it on, without the duct tape I'm sure it would fall apart. Wait no don't worry guys, [there's a belt.] (http://i.imgur.com/nwCW9BS.png) Just in case your pants fell off mid fight.  
  
I can only assume that [this is for aiming] (http://i.imgur.com/TWEV0cY.png) good luck putting this into use when it spreads like butter on ramen noodle bread (Really guys, try it, it's great.)  
  
[What's this for?] (http://i.imgur.com/otT3vlf.png)  
  
[This handle] (http://i.imgur.com/Q4MVHx3.png) is held on by [cable ties] (http://www.samuelgrant.co.uk/productsbig/135.jpg)  
  
You didn't think that the Stainless Pot was the only hat here did you? This isn't just any [handle] (http://i.imgur.com/ac39anE.png), this is the [Handyman's Handle!] (http://wiki.teamfortress.com/w/images/thumb/a/a4/Handyman's_Handle.png/250px-Handyman's_Handle.png?t=20111210080558)  
  
[Why is this here? Incase the rockets get jammed?] (http://i.imgur.com/W0wooyy.png)  
  
[No idea what this is but it's dumb] (http://i.imgur.com/vNJy0p7.png)  
  
So in summation, it looks bad. 




 How about you don't let him kill you? The same can be said in the ranks of Gibus players, some hatless noob dominated the Gibus and stole his hat! That's just rude. 




 You either die a hero, or live long enough to get so many points that you are the one to get autobalanced to become the villain. 




 You have me misunderstood friend, I mean "I got kicked for doing what is in the video yesterday", the other Pyros were doing the exploit, I was the one trying to prevent the exploit. 




 Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't there a strange Sole Mate worth about 1 key? If you're planning on snatching up a Sole Mate you might as well go big or go home. 




 So TF2 added a Pay to Win contract to counter spies and one contract is about keeping your sentry alive to get 5 kills?   
  
#SpyVsEngineerUpdateWillProbablyBeHereInAbout2YearsHYPE 




 I got kicked for doing this yesterday.  
"kick loak he is trying to do exploit" - The first asshole Pyro.  
"yeh kick he try to blow up last jihad jihad we tfgo now other stupid shit" - Asshole #2  
  
Edit: When I said doing this I meant doing what is in the video and stopping the exploit. 




 Offence: Degreaser  
Defence: Degreaser

 I had a guy offer on my unusuals and try to speed me up because he was going on a plane. Nobody is going on planes.  
  
If you're getting an amazing deal from PayPal, it's probably a scam. 




 Dude your Pyro is adorable, is that Marvin the Martian? 




 Personally I see literally no reason to not use this in MGE outside of BM. In pubs it rocks too if you spam like I do. 




 it would be extremely joyful 









 for you  
  
^^^^^^^^pan 




 it would be extremely panful 




 Can someone give me some info on why Nebris is called a cheater? 




 no one cared who i was until i put on the pan 




 at least you pan talk, who are you? 




 was getting caught part of your pan? 




 I'm counting that as the Widowmaker because it looks just like it. 




 [bruh] (http://i.imgur.com/HzXLTIG.png) 




 Well normal items are pretty expensive these days :^) 




 Maybe you can be that Medic? Pubs need a German every now and again. Also it helps boost gamesense as a little bonus. 




 Maybe in 2010 it was 25 on hit, but before this nerf/buff, it was 15.  
  
And as for healing 45 per shot, just grab a Medic buddy and the Blackbox was always a downgrade, it was never that strong to begin with if you could put a few seconds into thinking about killing him. 




 Title. Every item that can be crafted (To my knowledge at least) gets a craft number, only 100 of them can be seen ingame, but like [these canteens] (http://i.imgur.com/atD8a3y.png) they have a number visible on backpack.tf, so that got me thinking, what item has the highest crafted number?  
  
I'm sure that metal would be the highest if it had a number, but come on now, let's not be bitches about this, let's talk about cooler items.  
  
Personally I think that the item most people need to craft at a point is the MvM Upgrade Canteen.  
  
What are your thoughts? 




 You're a Soldier though, you'd need to be really bad to not do damage to get about +15 back anyway. I guess it was only a nerf to players who can't do damage. (No offence if you aren't good with this weapon after the nerf/buff) 




 I spent $7 on a spec ks strange BFB *ONE FUCKING DAY BEFORE THE UPDATE* 




 This reminds me of what I wanted to happen in MvM, I tried to use a teleport to spawn canteen to take someone back to spawn, didn't work.  




 That's a lie, this is OC right here. 









 This one time I ended up doing something that made me feel dumber than dirt.  
  
I was playing some Team Fortress 2 in a public game and somebody was sitting in the spawn not moving.  
I think nothing of it and go out to fight the good fight.  
After about 10 minutes of playing I hear a voice say "Mmph, shorwy I waws ghetting foowd."  
Clearly the guy had food in his mouth and didn't know to chew with his mouth closed.  
From what I can tell he was probably autistic or something because he talked in all the Heavy's lines.  
I play Medic alot so I ended up healing him.  
He always called me "DOCTOR" because that's what I was for him, I was his Doctor.  
In TF2 there's a mechanic called "Ubercharge" which you can google to learn about, not gonna explain it for you.  
The kid yells "DOCTOR, CHARGE ME WHEN BABY TEAM IS NEARBY! HIT IT DOCTOR, CHARGE ME!"  
I pop the uber and he wipes out the whole enemy team.  
He adds me and I accept.  
Every time we play together I go Medic and he goes Heavy.  
He always yells Heavy's battle cry or laughs like him all the time.  
Always thanks me, "YOU ARE GREAT DOCTOR!"  
I think he was poor because he never played any games other than TF2.  
Whenever I asked him about it he said "Doctor, money is needed, must collect money, but money is hard now."  
He sounded so sad so I asked him if he ever saw [Meet the Medic] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36lSzUMBJnc) to brighten up the mood.  
When he said no I gave him a link to the video.  
He was very ecstatic and eagerly asking about the part where the Medic put the uber part into the heart.  
He asked if it was possible to get a new heart with uber.  
I said heart transplants are possible, but without uber.  
He got sad again.  
"Maybe in the future."  
He then gave a Heavy laugh and said "THEN DOCTOR, HEAVY WILL WAIT FOR FUTURE."  
  
A few weeks pass.  
  
He messaged me saying "DOCTOR, Heavy will not be fighting until later in the night."  
It wasn't until tomorrow until he got on.  
For the record he called himself Heavy because that's the only class he ever played and it was his Steam name.  
  
I got a message saying "DOCTOR, Heavy doesn't feel well. I go to other doctors but they were nowhere near as good as you, DOCTOR."  
He sent this message when I was already asleep, I have no fucking idea where he lives.  
Last message said "DOCTOR, Heavy will go now. But do not fear baby men on other team. You are good doctor. With you, victory is always good. Heavy will join in future.  
By the time I got the message he was already offline.  
He never came back on in a year.  
One day he came back on, I messaged him and asked why he'd been away the whole time.  
It was his mom.  
"David, (Heavy), died of heart failure, I'm sorry. Are you the doctor he was always talking about? You're the only friend on his friends list. He was always going on about how him and the Doctor were best friends and how you always lead the team to victory. I don't know what he was talking about, but I was happy that he was happy. We're selling this computer because we never had much money to begin with, if we did he would be here right now."  
I sat there and looked at the screen for a good 5 minutes before another message popped up.  
"Before I sell this computer, I have one question I need to ask."  
I replied with "Please go ahead."  
"I need something."  
"What is it?"  
"I need about tree fiddy."  
  
Now it was around this time that I realized Heavy was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. Goddamnit! That Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again! "I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy you god damn loch ness monstah!"  




 The saddest thing I've ever seen was when my son stole my money and basically changed my whole perspective of him. Reader beware, you're in for a tear.  
  
It wasn't too long ago. I was doing some work around the house, and he came and asked "Dad, can I ask you a question?" so I said, "As long as you didn't get someone pregnant, go ahead."
He asked me if he could borrow $50 and I said "If you're just gonna spend it on booze you can go work for it."  
He just stared at me, looking real sad, then he went back inside. I started to contemplate if he actually needed something or if I was right about it just being beer money. I decided to trust him with the money and hope he wouldn't come back home reeking of liquor.  
About 4 hours later he came back looking incredibly proud of himself, he told me that he spent the money on a new suit to be made for him so he could get a job.
I was extremely happy about his decision to get a job, I had to sincerely apologize about accusing him of wanting cash for booze.  
I then asked him: Son, was there any change? He replied "Yes, About three fiddy." which he refused to give back. It was about that time I realized my son was a 7 stories tall crustacean from the paleolithic era. That damn loch ness Monster had gotten me again. Damnit, monsta, you ain't getting no three fiddy.

If you don't say the whole thing I'm not leaving the Oval Office. 




 Go to www.reddit.com/r/askreddit and look at a post that got gold, then steal that post and take the gold for myself.  




 "I need about tree fiddy." 




 The world's strongest man, Mark Henry got killed by a Scout! 




 Here's how I did my open contract:  
Get a Soldier/Demo/Scout or anyone else that can damage themselves to \#cutforbeiber and throw them Sandviches.  
  
Every Sandvich is 1 point which is very easy to grind when you stand by a medicine cabinet. 




 I need to fucking see a video of this 




 You can remove just the kit. 




 I had just started to (ab)use that thing! 




 With the nerf to the Baby Face's now you need to pull out the PPBP to not be heavily gimped from either jumping or taking damage. That's the only time when Quickman Bostonian's fall damage is justified, when he doesn't want to jump and lose 3/4 of his speed. 




 But when you have the weapon out you take 20% extra damage from everything, so if it makes you take 20% extra afterburn it's still 3 but if they use "The Price is Right!" Logic and mess around with the numbers like I mess around with sound files then you probably take more fire damage than you could heal. 




 I agree! (What the fuck is he talking about?) 




 Dude you got the American Pasta launcher! The Freedom Fettuccine!  




 I actually thought Sasha sounded familiar when I was watching AoT on Netflix earlier today, so I googled the voice actress and was like "WOAOOAOAOAAH DUDE WHAT ARE YOU KIDDING ME THE POTATO GIRL IS THE SAME GIRL THAT SCOUT MAINS WANNA BANG!?"  
  
Well actually my reaction was "..." because I don't talk to myself but in my head I was flipping out. 




 I think I used to use that HUD, I'm trying to remember the name of it. Is it one of the following?  
  
Toonhud.  
Flathud.  
Rayshud.  
Yahud. 




 All painted Australium Gold, I think the hat is the Cosa Nostra Cap, The Blood Banker and the Made Man. I put those three into loadout.tf and got [this] (http://i.imgur.com/Sfn6Osz.png) so I think I'm correct.  
  
I don't like that I'm better at naming hats than I am at algebra, but I guess the only jobs that require algebra are algebra teachers so I think I'm fine with my hat knowledge. 




 To me this is just another thing to stick my dick in. 




 If you have Netflix or something you should check out some of the shows she has a voice in and be like "Yo that's Miss Pauling eating a potato! I'm so glad that /u/test_subject7026 showed me that this character is actually Miss Pauling! Now I'm gonna go play Saints Row and use the Ash DLC and basically have Miss Pauling as a homie because that's a cool DLC!" 









 [kncucklxers hte ecnhchildalada] (https://sonicisreal.bandcamp.com/track/unknown-from-m-e) 




 I respect your opinion and do agree that it is a great weapon, but compared to what it used to be I just can't use it in the same way. 




 There's really no other option now, it used to be a choice between jumping higher or taking no fall damage, now it's just jumping higher because the PBPP is a horrible weapon. 




 The last one would be about as useful as a Stickybomb Launcher that sticks to players.  
  
If you could pick up your own intel, why not just run it to the other team and help them cap?  




 It's a good thing I already got some karma today because I know I'm going to lose some here from butthurt Sniper mains.

 All Soldier mains hate Tom Jones, he ruined our unboxes with his poppy music! 




 UWU THEY'RE SO CUTE I AM NOW A PYRO MAIN :[] 




 This is also true for when I'm trying to get up to a 5 killstreak and some douchebag Pyro comes up to "help" me and steals 3 kills because Pyro does damage so rapidly.  
  
I just want glowey eyes! 




 Ah okay gotcha, that would explain why that one sub called like /r/paoyongyang or something is about Ellen Pao being hated. 




 I like your Soldier loadout, Australium Gold Spook Specs looks really cool. 




 how to get magic gun as burnman? 




 If I had to make a guess, I'd say that people are closing the subs to prevent spam or they're closing them and won't reopen them until something happens with Ellen Pao.  
  
AFAIK she got fired from Reddit and people are mad about it. 




 *sweet guitar riff* 




 Alright thanks, I was pretty sure the guy was trying to scam me because his in game inventory was worth maybe 30 cents at the most and kept saying he was going to catch a plane in "10 minutes" and kept pressuring me to give him the items. 




 So somebody wanted to buy some items in a game from me through PayPal, he said he's going first and I'm pretty sure he did judging from [this email] (http://i.imgur.com/pay2u34.png).  
  
But it looks like it's telling me to add the email to an account, which I've already done. I've had this email sitting here for at least 3 hours now and I [still haven't got any money in my account] (http://i.imgur.com/mxOKdmO.png).  
  
Is it normal to have the email like this while my account has the email confirmed?  
  
Edit: Changed the screenshot of the email to not include the guy's name. 




 Have you ever seen a Clown's Laughter?  
*badum tss* 




 rest in peace lew moo, he was an hero to us all ;( 




 I want your most expensive item! But not really because it's private and don't know what it is. 




 Text post so no karma whoring for me :O 




 One of them sold for over $500 nzd! The most nzd an item can cost is around $550 so I'd say in a few weeks you can get the max Steam cash on your pro ks kit. 




 Can confirm, my Sandwich is much like a real sandwich and does not come back after eating it.
