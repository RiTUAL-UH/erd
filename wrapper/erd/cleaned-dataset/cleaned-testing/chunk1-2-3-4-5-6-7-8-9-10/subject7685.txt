Example:

Boy: I'm off to school Mom.
Mom: Ok, don't forget to bring a packed lunch.

When it should be like this:

Boy: I'm off to school Mom.
Mom: Don't forget to take a packed lucnh.

If you're talking to someone and you're asking them to take something from where you are to somewhere else the word take should be used. If you're talking to someone and you want them to bring something to your current location the word bring should be used. I don't understand the misuse. 










































































 It just seems logical. So much quicker, plus you don't have to remember/write down your passwords and such. 













































































































































































































































































































































































































































 I'm literally angry with rage right now.

I love Gears of War. Easily the best part about it in my opinion is Horde mode. It's the mode me and my mate spent the most time playing in Gears 2 and Gears 3. Now all of a sudden they've removed for some unknown reason.

And to add insult to injury the game is shipping with only 4 COMPETITIVE MULTIPLAYER MAPS!!!!!! Gears 3 shipped with 10 for fuck's sake. I have been lookin gfor ward to this game for so damn long and now my dreams have been dashed against the rocks of bitterness. Sure I'll still play the campaign and a bit of overrun mode and miltuplayer but the main draw is gone.

I know for a fact that if I hadn't pre-ordered this game weeks ago I sure as heel wouldn't be buying it now.

Way to royally fuck things up People Can Fly.

Anyone else disappointed by this news? 
























































































































































































 I personally don't really mind. Most of my games are on disc but I have a couple of dozen games downloaded from Xbox LIVE and PSN. I would probably be sad when the time comes that games no longer come on a physical medium but I will understand that it's been made redundant. 
































































 Please don't downvote people for their opinions, unless they word them in a scumbag kind if way. 

Personally I hate Gangnam Style and Harlem Shake videos. I just genuinely don't see the appeal of either and am befuddled as to why they are so popular. 

Your turn...

 I've been in a crew of 3 with a couple of mates since launch. They're not buying the PS4 version and so I think I'll want to join a crew that does stuff. No roleplaying or anything but definitely fun stuff. I'm an average gunman but an above average vehicle handler.

What does your crew offer in the way of fun/things to do? 










































































 RULES FOR CONSIDERATION:

-They must be somewhat realistic. For example Sonic and Mario are not allowed, but Master Chief and Marcus Fenix are allowed.
- They must be proficient with guns. Swords and fireballs etc don't count.
- They may be male or female.


HAVE AT IT! 






























































































 One of the most strangely fascinating films I ever saw was Waking Life.

Blurb:
A boy has a dream that he can float, but unless he holds on, he will drift away into the sky. Even when he is grown up, this idea recurs. After a strange accident, he walks through what may be a dream, flowing in and out of scenarios and encountering various characters. People he meets discuss science, philosophy and the life of dreaming and waking, and the protagonist gradually becomes alarmed that he cannot awake from this confusing dream.  


































 Think about it. When your wife asks where you're going you can truthfully tell her "I'm going to the future." Say you had to come back home because you forgot your wallet, when leaving for the second time you could say "I'm going back to the future!"

 Hey guys. My oldest and most popular series is Skyrim Roleplay Adventure where I never break the 4th wall.

Here's the first episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_K8F-MGvw

And here's the latest episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qOufdKDD88

Please let me know what you think. 




 Hey guys. I've been making Let's Play videos for a year now and would like to share some of my thoughts of my experience.

My channel focuses mainly on story driven let's plays, my oldest and most popular series is Skyrim Roleplay Advneutre where I never break the 4th wall. In addition to this I have done let's plays of The Last Of Us (no commentary), Gears of War Judgment, Max Payne 3, GTAV, Metal Gear Solid 2 HD (no kills, no commentary) and Heavy Rain Move Edition (no commentary). I also make and upload random videos like GTA montages and I used to make the occasional Black Ops 2 video.

As anyone who does let's plays can tell you there's much more to it than simply playing the game with a mic in front of you, which I wasn't expecting when I started. I think I've streamlined my process a lot since I began doing this last year and the general quality of my videos has improved as the months have passed.

I seem to be plagued by inactive subscribers, although this may be due to my upload schedule. I always stayed away from a schedule because I didn't want this hobby to start feeling like work, but realised my subs deserve content at regular intervals. So I started uploading my two current let's plays of Skyrim and Beyond Two Souls at 8pm GMT on Fridays and Wednesdays respectively. This doesn't seem to have helped my view count at all. I suspect that because the majority of my  views come from America I should start uploading videos at USA friendly times, do you think this is a good idea?

I'm disappointed that I have nearly 300 subscribers but struggle to get more than 15 views per video, after a year of doing this I've only made $25. I've considered giving up a couple of times but then I regain the passion for making the videos and carry on. Another thing that bothers me is that people almost never leave comments on my videos. I welcome feedback and always respond to the few comments that do get posted. Oh well, if they don't want to leave a comment they shouldn't feel obliged to I suppose, but it would be nice to have some interaction with my fans so I can humanise them. For the last year they've just been some intangible force.

Anyway that's my experience after one year of making let's plays. Let's hope the second year is more rewarding.

 Does it stack?

Example: If I use Aquaman's S1 to cause bleeding them immediately use it again do I get double bleeding damage or should I wait until the first bleed is finished before tridenting the enemy again?

 Can the name of a sub be changed once it's started? 
































































 I put the work in to get into the top 4% and then like many others my time and effort was turned into a complete and utter waste of time literally overnight. I was down to some shitty bronze level. Did anyone get compensdated for the work they put in? Like at least be given the reward for the rank they were at before the game fucked them over? I think that would only be fair. Or if that's too much work for the guys who make the game how about a good faith prize of 100,000 credits or something? It would really suck if they fucked us over and offered nothing to make up for it. The risk of it happening again haunts me. 



















 I couldn't play saturday but have been sessioning the game for the last two days but I don't have time to get to the top 4%. It seems everyone is playing this season much more than the last couple.

*Ares' 














 I was in the top 5%, then I checked again hours later (without playing) and I was in the top 3%. I look this morning and just assume a new season had started. Nope. There's 15 or so hours left and I'm bronze because of the battle points issue. I'm not playing today, what's the point in giving us an extra 24 hours? WTF can we achieve in that time? Silver? I wish they'd just accepted this season as a complete fail and moved onto a season with a decent reward instead of trying to resurrect this season's corpse for 24 hours. Now I have no reason to play the game for the next 15 hours. 















































































 It seems to me that every time he opens his mouth he says something you'd expect to hear from someone living in the 1700's. 





























 Why do they allow us to pay for promotion on most cards, but then there's some that can only be promoted if you're lucky enough to get that card again from a certain pack (looking at you killer frost) while others can only be promoted through online challenges? It's infuriating! I have GF Supes, Ares, and KJJ on a team. I have a promotion waiting for Supes as I completed the single player challenge twice. I have to wait for Ares to show up in the MP season again to get a promotion for him so who knows when that'll happen, and KJJ won't be promoted until I manage to get another 60 alliance credits together.

On another team I have Raven, Aquaman, and Killer Frost regime. Raven and Aquaman can be promoted at any time with credits, I like this. But Killer Frost can only be promoted by being lucky enough to find her again in a challenge booster pack, which I have no intention of doing because there's too many cards in there that I don't want to warrant trying to get one specific card from it. This seems like lunacy to me. Does anyone know why they've made it so infuriating to keep teammates promoting in sync? 












































 Who are they and do you rotate characters from team to team?

I've always teamed 3 characters together and stuck with that. I only ever mess up the teams when doing challenges that require certain characters.

I currently have 7 teams in my rotation, they are:

Bronze Team:

Nightwing E7 Lv 47
Green Lantern E7 Lv 47
The Flash E7 Lv 47

Silver Team:

Deathstroke E7 Lv 50
Regime Doomsday E7 Lv 50
Wonder Woman E7 Lv 50

The following teams are all gold:

Regime Superman E1 Lv 50
Batman E1 Lv 49
Regime Wonder Woman E1 Lv 50

Man of Steel General Zod Lv 50
Lobo Lv 50
Red Son Green Lantern Lv 50

Raven Lv 38
Aquaman Lv 38
Killer Frost Lv 38

Blackest Night Batman Lv 32
Luchador Bane Lv 31
Regime Raven Lv 31

Godfall Superman Lv 24
Ares Lv 24
Killing Joke The Joker Lv 24

I don't buy power credits that's why I have so few promoted gold cards.

My next team will be Cassandra Cain Batgirl, who I've already got, and I'm going to team her up with Animated Batman Beyond and MKX Scorpion when they turn up. 














 Hey guys. I just tried to buy 600,000 power credits using some itunes credit I have lying around but it seems to have not spent the credit. I can live with this, but the game crapped out on me after it said "purchase complete". I reloaded the game to find I have 1,200,000 power credits. I only wanted one money pack but I seem to have been given two. I did not intend on buying two packs. I want to see if I've been shafted and charged for an extra pack I didn't want. These things are 35 a piece! Is there any way I can see my purchase history? This is an issue. 











































































































































































































































































































 Pretty sure I'm asking for trouble here. Let's see if we can engage in civil discourse.

 I love 3D in films and games.

I love VR.

I have a PS4.

Guess what I'm looking forward to. 




 I've literally never hear anyone say meninism before. This is new to me.
 




 As seen on the front page yesterday. 




 The PS4's controller last for 4hrs on one charge.

Sounds like your controller was broken mate. I can usually get pretty much a full day of gaming done on one charge, and I don't dim the light bar at all. I guess the amount of vibrating the controller does plays a big part, but since I play GTA Online and Mortal Kombat X the most these days I'd say my controller vibrates a lot.

Edit: Downvoted for...... I got nothing. 




 The trouble with Jason Statham is this. He plays the exact same character in every film he's in. "The guy that beats up everyone." Don't get me wrong, he's very good at it, but every new film I see him in I just think "Oh, he's doing what he does in every film, nothing new."

But that's just me. 




 I've always preferred racing cleanly. But when I know I'm up against a dirty driver I'll go ham on their ass. I'm pretty good at racing in GTA and I have this mantra:

There's a difference between a dirty driver, and a good driver who's driving dirty. Got any racing crews I should look up? I've been away from GTA for a while because 18 months of playing it daily burned me out, plus my old crew members all stopped playing, this seems like a good reason to get back into the game I love.  




 Also If you accidently hit someone off, you have to wait and let them pass you

If I find myself racing someone that seems to be a clean driver I'll try to avoid hitting them. If I do hit them I always slow down for them as a sign that I didn't do it on purpose. Maybe I should look into joining a race crew, never considered that being a thing. I much prefer the racing to things like TDM Capture anyway. 




 I'm sure you can. But it's hard to kill someone when they've got their sight aimed at the only entrance/exit to the place. 




 Yeah true, I could have worded it better. But I was fresh out of a conversation with one of those pricks and my anger carried over. I think the name is applicable though. Anyone who considers themselves to be a better human being than someone else simply because of the piece of metal and plastic they use to play video games on, is a retard. They claim "It's satire" and "It's a joke!". Well, it's not a joke to the people they insult and try to make feel like shit. 




 Exactly. I'm not saying it's a bad thing. I'm just saying that without us "useless peasants" a lot of the games PC gamers love wouldn't even exist, or at least would exist in a worse capacity due to budgetary constraints. 




  And its not steams choice to put the game on sale its the developers themeselves

Yeah, because it's the best way they can get people to buy their games on steam since games on steam are so cheap they can't possibly charge full price for it. The market is willing to part with less cash per game than the console market. I guess that's the crux of my argument. 




 Having a game slightly held back graphically is better than having a game majorly held back by a lack of budget, or even having no game at all. 




  AC Unity (a flop in many ways) and Far Cry 4 haven't been more than 40% off (35.99) on Steam, for example.

Maybe I was exaggerating a bit, but I'm willing to bet that's still cheaper than they've ever been on consoles when bought brand new.

I once saw a collection of 5 GTA games for something like 30. That blew my mind. I've been told many times that PC games are so cheap on steam they actually offset the massive cost of the hardware, the the point of PC gaming actually being the cheaper option in the long run. That's some cheap games right there. 




 If you don't mind paying 45 quid for console versions, you shouldn't mind paying the same or more for better PC versions.

I disagree. I'm ok with paying 55 (current average price of a new game) on console because I don't have an alternative. If I switched to PC gaming I'd definitely take advantage of the low low prices PC gamers enjoy.

The sales on PSN and XBOX Live pale in comparison to the sales on steam. I don't recall ever hearing a console gamer saying "I have 200 games in my backlog", but it's a relatively common PC gamer quote.

I'm not saying that consoles don't do anything that could potentially harm profit of games such as sales, but that we're constantly being told how much cheaper games are on PC. I'm routinely told that games are so cheap on PC that it offsets the massive cost of the hardware and actually turns out to be the cheaper gaming option in the long run, the game are that much cheaper.

As for used games, I feel this argument is negated by the PC pirating argument. They cancel each other out.  




 Not really. It's more a case of "We need more money to make better games. And consoles give us the most money. So if we didn't develop for consoles The Witcher 3 would be a shell of what it currently is because the budget would have been much smaller." 




 Available to the common man in 2030. 




 Fine... I'll say it if no-one else will.

Ahem.

Dat ass tho. 




 "This way, if one of us falls, we all fall! Yay!" 




  If you buy games at release, you would continue to buy games at release

I bet some people would change their buying habits, it's impossible to say. On console we don't have ability to wait 4 months for the price to drop 85% like PC gamers do. 




  like Starcraft II, with 6 million units sold, which compares well against Gears of War 3's 6.3 million).

I'm willing to bet that Starcraft II had the benefit of being in steam sales, which are known to knock up to 95% of a game's price off. Compare that to Gears of War 3 where the vast majority of copies sold likely went for full retail price or close to it. While the number of units sold is comparable, the price of each unit sold could possibly vary wildly between the two games.

I'm just speculating here but I bet the 6 million copies of GoW3 made way more money (not including dlc or microtransactions) than starcraft II did. Of course I could be totally wrong. There's a lot of assumptions being made here. I guess the point is, games are way cheaper on PC, and therefore don't make as much money, and therefore don't allow devs to get a bigger budget for the next game as much as console sales do. 




 lack of fees to physical copies

I'm not sure what you mean by this. Are you saying they save money because they don't have to put the game on a disc?

More sells in general

There may be more sales on PC but the games are selling for way less than people pay on consoles with all the constant steam sales going on.

Five GTA games for 20? Yeah, console gamers have to pay a little bit more than that. 




  Ezio or another assassin would work too, I suppose

Just like Spawn, it's been done before. We don't need another fighting game with him in. 




   Rain is probably not coming due to him being DLC last time (and them saying previously they don't want to charge for the same character twice in a row)

Boon says a lot of stuff that turns out to be just lies though. I take what he says with a pinch of salt these days.

That said, he's tweeted multiple times "The Rain falls when he may". So, guessin gis all we can do I guess. 




  I'd love seeing the most hated return if not just to annoy a lot of the fans.

You just admitted you'd be perfectly fine with the only reason to include those characters is to piss off other people who love the game you love.

So you're an asshole? 




 Can anyone name any guest characters in fighting games that have been in more than one franchise? Obviouslly not including Smash Bros.

Spawn was in the Xbox version of Soul Calibur 2, not sure if he'd make an appearance in MKX. 




 All I want is Noob. But isn't it too obvious it's going to be Rain, Sindel, Smoke, and Baraka? 




  They recode/port games to consoles

What about all the games that are ported to PC? It's it 50/50? aren't there just as many ports either way? Also PC games are usually only 5 or 10 cheaper than the console version. Steam sales make games as little 10% of the price of an average console version. PC gamers give developers less money than console gamers, I mean a lot less. 




 Let's say 100 million console gamers just made the switch to PC gaming overnight. The sales numbers wouldn't be comparable because of the aforementioned cheapness of games in general on PC. Profits would go down and therefore budgets would go down, and games would likely get worse. 




 The PC sales would rise but the prices of games on steam are so low that even with the increased PC player base the profit margins wouldn't be anywhere near where they are now with console gamers paying on average something like 45 for a game, and PC gamers pay what, an average of 15 per game? Also humble bundles, all those free games have to be paid for on console. 




 You're right, it doesn't mean I should. but it also doesn't mean it shouldn't. I'm sorry if I offended you. 




 This is an excerpt from an interview with Marcin Iwinski from CD Projekt Red.

"If the consoles are not involved there is no Witcher 3 as it is," answers Marcin Iwinski, definitively. "We can lay it out that simply. We just cannot afford it, because consoles allow us to go higher in terms of the possible or achievable sales; have a higher budget for the game, and invest it all into developing this huge, gigantic world.

Finally. Listen up PC Master Retards. I know PC gaming is king, anyone who disagrees is an idiot. But the next time you give us console gamers shit because our systems are "Holding back gaming" and "Necessitating the dumbing down of our precious games" Just remember that a fucking huge chunk of the money given to developers from the sale of their games comes from us console gamers. Those precious steam sales you always brag about, the cheapness of the games you're always boasting about, they're not doing the devs any favours.

So the next time you bitch about console gamers ruining your games, just know that without us you wouldn't have half of them at all.

Now let's all get along for fuck's sake.

 I found them yesterday when someone posted this and called it "Find Link!" 




 The multiplayer in RDR had some great ideas, but god damn was it one of the most broken online experiences I've ever had. Sometimes it would be cool, you'd posse up and do gang hideouts. Never really got into the competitive stuff because of the aforementioned brokenness.

And by brokenness, I mean invisible people on bulls that slide along the ground, missing any kind of animation, and being killed by mystery people constantly.

I would rate the single player of RDR a perfect 10/10, and I don't bandy 10/10 very much. But I would give the multiplayer a 3/10 because of how broken it was for me. It would be 1/10 but they had some really cool ideas hidden in there. 




 So you'd gang up on people who caused carnage but when people come after you for the same reason you run away and hide in a spot that makes you impossible to kill?

So brave, lol. 




 I can't agree more. I used to always honk my horn as a sign of friendliness, trying to meet people, do missions with them.

But after a while of having people kill you for no reason you really start to lose the will to be friendly. These days I will immediately murder anyone who gets what I deem to be too close. I won't think twice about blowing their car up. I use to worry about paying for their car, now I see it as a minor inconvenience.

About a year ago I became the thing I hated most when playing GTA Online, and I make no apologies. The small amount of bastards in the game have slowly turned everyone else into a bastard. 




 Yeah, I know what swatting is lol. I was being an arsehole. 




  I'm one of these people who doesn't read every article on the Internet

I'm also one of those people. But news is everywhere these days. I'm surprised you didn't hear of it. 




 Thanks for the heads up but... what can we do with this information? I mean, that situation isn't all that common. I guess we just keep playing. 




 This is old news. I don't see how anyone living in the UK didn't know this last week when it was all over the news.

What pissed me off the most was that people were complaining that it's sexist. Saying it portrays women in a negative light. While it does portray women in a negative light no-one was talking about the fact that they has almost identical ads with men on them. But because they were portraying men in a negative light it's not seen as sexist.

Fucking double standards. 




 swated? 




 And then she said , "That is NOT two children wearing a trenchcoat!" 




 I found Sub-Zero and Marge Simpson.

That'll do. 




 I would only ever use it if I has permission first, which is fucked up when you think about it.

It's considered racist for a non-black  person to say a word, which is itself pretty racist.

Anyway, yeah, I'd never use it as an insult in any way. I once knew a pair of black twins and we became good friends (this was a few years back). They used to say nigga a lot, so I asked them if it were cool if used it when talking to them. I made it clear that it would only ever be used as a sign of friendship and not as a derogatory term.

They were totally fine with it. They were a couple of cool dudes. I wonder where they are now. 




 If the Raiden challenge doesn't get released with the new update I'm giving up all hope of it ever coming out.

"Coming Soon" my fucking arse. 




 It's the premiere of the film Michael produced, or co-produced, I forget. 




 That's brilliant. At first I thought, ok, I see where this is headed. But the various cut scenes they put him in were great choices. I just want to see Lester dancing like this in the background of every shot the next time I play through the story.

How Nightmares Are Born

or

The Arrival of Nope 




 No faction wars for 2 days now and STILL NO RAIDEN CHALLENGE. I'm running out of reasons to keep playing this instead of going back to Injustice. It's like they want people to stop playing. 




 This is what I do on both Pokemon and Injustice. People say X is the best character in terms of dps and health, Y is the best character to team with X because reasons.

I literally only use characters I simply feel like using. All my teams are personal to me as a result. 




 Yes, exactly. And when we don't know if something is true the default position of a rational mind is to not believe it's true until we DO know.

I'm not saying ghosts don't exist. I'm saying that there is no good reason right now to believe the claim that they exist, and so I don't believe it. I could be wrong, but I think it's foolish to believe a claim without a good reason.  




 It's like Netherrealm went out of their way to make a lot of the costumes in this game fucking hideous.  




 Fair enough I suppose. It just seems like all the combo videos I see online do the same thing. They show a character doing a combo but done even attempt to try to teach you anything. I guess some of that hostility carried over to this video to. I apologise, you didn't deserve my shitty comment.  




 My favourite part was when the video explained ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.  




 You can duck it. But then they do it again and again without giving you time to stand up, walk, and duck again. Yeah you can slide under it but you need literally perfect timing to avoid every bullet.  




 As a Sub Zero mainer I can confirm that his slide is very punishable.

Anyone know how to counter full auto jacqui's machine gun as sub zero? Tired of being beaten by people spamming that OP move.  




 This. You can't buy something not knowing what it included (even though it's been publicly available for months) then complain it didn't include something they didn't list.  




 Good job I think the Russian costumes are hideous.

 Hahahahhaha! It's funny because he's dumb! HAHHAA! 




 I'm already bored of the single player. I played the story. Dabbled with the towers. But ever since I started gaming online I've found fighting the CPU in fighting games to be really boring and unsaisfying, which is a shame given the amount of single player content on offer here.

If only they gave us a good reward for beating the towers, I might bother with them more often. The complete 50 living towers trophy is gonna kill me. 




 It's been down for me since last night. I noticed it was down 16 hours ago, and it's still down. 




 Further proof that troll no longer means "monster that dwell sunder bridges trying to eat children" but now means "Cunt who finds pleasure in pissing people off." 




 The comment may have not seemed dumb to me at the time. But upon reflection I can see I was making several assumptions to lead me to the point I felt warranted posting. I was dumb to make a comment based on said  assumptions and therefore I consider the comment to be dumb, or at the very least not very well thought out.

I don't mind being proven wrong though, it means I've learned something new. I now know more truths than I did when I posted that comment, and that's a good thing in my book.  




 Then please disregard my previous comments. They were dumb and unnecessary.  




 Copied from just a couple of days ago. Impressive. 




 I feel bad that I eat meat. I mean, I can't justify it. It's immoral.

But fuck 'em, because bacon and steak. 




 I'd 100% the story, then spend all my time doing missions in GTA Online. 




 As much as I'd like some story DLC I'm glad to see they're not done with GTA Online. I need a reason to go back there since everyone I played with has left and there's not really much else left that I want to buy. I've got 2 mil sat in the bank, just waiting for something spend it on. Over 42 days spent in GTA Online, I've done pretty much everything there is to do in Los Santos many times each, it'll be nice to have a reason to go back there.

Unless the content they're talking about is just more jobs, most of which I'll never play (capture etc etc). Fewer jobs and more missions would be nice. And I mean missions, not just:

1. Go here.
2. Grab this.
3. Take is here.

That's 99% of the missions in GTA Online unfortunately. 




 Or, y'know. Yawning. 




  But hundreds of thousands of experiences, if not more, can't ALL be attributed to mental illness or mistake

Yes they can. Of course they can. Why do you think they can't all be explained by natural means? That's like saying 2 billion people can't be wrong. Yes they can! you just made the appeal to popularity logical fallacy.

The number of people believing something has absolutely no bearing on whether or not it's true.



some of those somethings have been captured on photographs and video

And yet not a single one has been confirmed. Not a single account of anything supernatural in the history of mankind has ever been confirmed as being true. That's why the default position on supernatural occurrences is to not believe it until it's been demonstrated to be true, which is why I don't believe, because every single claim of the supernatural has failed to meet it's burden of proof. 

 It would be better to assume it exists and try to quantify it, than to assume it doesn't and ignore it

But people aren't ignoring it. People are doing real scientific tests (and have been forever) to see if such things exist. People will always test for those things. BUT UNTIL THERE'S A GOOD REASON TO BELIEVE THEY EXIST THE DEFAULT POSITION IS TO NOT BELIEVE A CLAIM. Sorry for shouting but that's the most important part. There is no good reason (word of mouth is not a good reason) to believe ghosts exist. People are looking for them, they will continue to look, but they've found nothing.

If ghosts were even half confirmed it would be the biggest news in the history of mankind. Make no mistake, people are looking, but they've found nothing so far. 




 You are 100%. There is always the possibility of a method being developed, but until such a thing exists there's no way to verify paranormal claims and therefore no good reason the believe any of them are real things i.e. ghosts. 




 It's all good then. 




 Lol. I had no friends with the game, but I met some people online in Paradise City and had a blast trying to complete as many of the 500+ online challenges together and against each other. Fuck. I need to play that game again.  

















































 Seriously. the game has been out for what, two months at this point? And pretty much since launch they've told us the challenge is "coming soon". Stretching the definition of the word soon IMO.

They also lose points for spelling koming with a c. 














 I want to know if I'm in the top 2000 players (ranked 1v1) in the world, or just on the PS4 k thx bye. 














 How are your wins/losses presented to other players? If I'm playing ranked 1v1 and I see my opponent's wins/losses, is that their total online wins/losses or just their wins/losses for ranked 1v1? Same goes for other game modes like KOTH. 












































 I've been doing the souls exploit to be able to have multiple attempts at the test your luck and daily objectives. I notice there's a reward rank for the test your luck and it goes up each day, unless I do the souls exploit, then it resets. My question is this. Is it worth letting the reward rank rack up? I remember a similar thing on Injustice Mobile but the rewards were a joke, even after hundreds of consecutive days. Should I hold out for great rewards or just say fuck it and keep cheating? 





























 The red spear symbol under the koins earned in the post fight menu, does that represent ranking XP? 




 Who are you using?

**Bronze:**

Lin Quei, Shirai Ryu, Monk



**Silver:**

Sub-Zero, Scorpion, Farmer Jax

Kano, D'Vorah, Reptile

Jax Briggs, Sonya Blade, Kenshi


**Gold:**

Ninjutsu Scorpion, Shaolin Kung Jin, Inferno Scorpion

Stunt Double Johnny Cage, Sun God Kotal Kahn, Possessed Kenshi

Assassin Kitana (lucky pull!), Bojutsu Kung Jin, [waiting for Raiden]

All the gold cards were attained from gold kombat packs. 




 It seems Netherrealm are trying to stretch the definition of the terms "temporarily down" and "coming soon".

I know some people are able to play the Faction Wars. Congrats Netherrealm, you almost managed to get an online portion of a game working. Does anyone know how "soon" the Raiden challenge coming? I plan on adding him to Assassin Kitana and Bojustsu Kung Jin but if it's going to be months before the challenge arrives I might as well buy more gold packs. 




 I had the hatch I app on my phone a while back but got bored and deleted it. Now I see it's got Apple watch support I got it again. But it seems all you can with the watch is look at you hatchi. I can't seem to interact at all. Does anyone know if you actually can interact with it? If you can't in deleting it again.  




 How do you get them? Seems like I haven't gotten any new ones in ages and I've forgotten how you get them. 




 So I'm fighting... some tower. the last one in the Kove looking portion of the map. Was it really too much to ask for them to label these things? Regardless.

I'm on fight 4/6, and it's cheap IMO. Firstly I'm forced to use a card I don't own. This annoys me because it messes up the equal levelling I used to go for in Injustice, but I can live with that. The trouble is Cassie's passive. It claims "All Spec Ops teammates have a 25% chance of unblockable attacks." And she's teamed with 2 Spec Ops cards. I don't believe the 25% part at all. In my experience 3 out of 5 attacks they do is unblockable, and this is all 3 characters remember. So I've breezed up to this point, but now because I can't use my own team (and the passive benefits that provides) I need to bring two cards that are wildly OP in order to finish this battle. When you're stripped of your team passives and the ability to block while the computer has both of those advantages the fight is insanely cheap.

The rampant and unpredictable difficulty in the fights in this game need to be addressed. You can be going along just fine then BAM! They give you a fight that's in a different league from the ones that preseded it in the same damn tower. If this was a boss battle I could almost be ok with the cheapness, but it's just fight 4/6.

Cheap. 









 If his match win animation doesn't include him whipsering ["Anytime..."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHhCYpnnGoo) to his fallen opponent I'm gonna sow cress seeds into Netherealm's carpets as a sign of protest. 




 I must say this game doesn't disappoint on the whole. Sure the multiplayer suffers from lag, but the lag seems largely consistent so I can usually work around it. Certainly no worse than MK9 and Injustice as far as I can tell.

The graphics are awesome, not the best I've seen, but definitely "next gen", which is something we've seen too little of since the consoles launched IMO.

Sound design. Top notch! I know they put a lot of work into the sound for the game and it shows. All the right crunches and whooshes are there.

Story mode. The best story mode in any fighting game I've played. Worth playing just for the cut scenes. I'm glad Netherealm put so much time into what is now a largely ignored fighting game mode. I love the fact that as well as each character having their own unique arcade mode ending there's a singular canon narrative to play through that solidifies everything story wise.

Music. Can't complain. It does the job, reminds me of MK9.

Krypt. I think this is a fun way to unlock stuff in a game, best krypt so far IMO.

Basically I'm loving this game more than I was hoping I would. I only have a couple of gripes, but they're small and easily ignored when looking at the game as a whole.

1. No Noob Saibot. My mains are always Sub-Zero and Noob. At least Sub-Zero's good in this game.2
2. Sub-Zero's defaiult costume is ugly as hell! But there's plenty of good ones and the inclusion of the Klassic skin made up for the poor Kurrent one.
3. I miss the avatrs from the old KoTH mode. But oh well.

What do you guys think of the game? 









 This started today for me. After every fight I just get the MK logo loading symbol, the one that usually precedes the post battle info like koins earned etc. I have to close the app and reopen it.

Anyone else having this issue? iOS 




 I want to know when to come back and laugh at all the people who waited until it wasn't relevant anymore to get red. 












































 Title. 












































 Anyone else really happy that this exists? I've always hated the new Sub Zero design. I don't mind the Kuai Liang and Revenant kostumes but god DAMN the klassic skin is too sexy. Feels great to represent my boy Sun Zero with him looking the way I remember. After giving him the MKII klassic skin in MK9 I love the fact they went for the UMK3 klassic skin this time.

Any other costumes you guys are super happy with?

[For those who haven't seen it](http://insidemk.altervista.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Mortal-Kombat-X_Sub-Zero_Klassic_Bio.jpg) 

















































 Probably not. But seriously, when will we get the other half of the game? 









 I'd love to Netherealm, but you won't fucking let me. Can't they just remove this uncompletable objective until they finally have a product that's ready for launch? 



















 I have a bonus mission "Win 3 fights using a Spec Ops card that you own."

I'm doing the tower where Kitana is on your team and I put Trooper on my team and won 3 fights. The bonus mission shows no progress.

Is this a known bug? 




 I'm currently up to the Reptile boss. Is there going to be a faster way to earn souls, or at the very least more ways? I know it's the premium currency and they want to make you buy them but god damn they're slow to earn. At this stage I think I actually prefer the "buy characters for a ridiculous amount of gold" system they used in Injustice. At least with that system I always felt like I was earning currency to go towards characters.

I suppose factions will include some way of earning souls. Whenever they actually manage to make it work that is. 














 I've only encountered two bosses thus far, Kotal Khan and Reptile, and is it just me or are they wildly overpowered?

I mean, I know bosses are meant to be tougher than their henchmen but when you can simply breeze through 6 or 7 fights then all of a sudden hit a wall you can't get past until you seriously upgrade your cards, that's surely an issue? Is there any particular reason (other than to try to hassle you into buying microtransactions) why they would do this? 









 I was expecting this game to be at least as fun as Injustice but from what I can tell so far it's. It's not even close.

The animations look sloppy in the MK game. They look like they were animated by amateurs. The animations on injustice were crisp, clear, and just better looking, they flowed more realistically. 

I call bull on the control scheme. I was told that like Injustice if you tap you get a weak combo and if you swipe you get a heavy combo. Well, so far tapping and swiping have done nothing but activate the same two combos. There's literally no difference between tapping and swiping, meaning that when I tell my character to attack I have no idea what he's going to do. Is this a problem with the game or jut my version? I'd be interested in hearing.

There's so many other little things that injustice did right that MK mobile just does wrong. It's like this game was made before injustice.

How do you evade specials that involve throws? Seems awfully cheap of you can't do the equivalent of blocking them like other specials.

I was expecting something so much better. I was expecting injustice with MK characters. What I got was what genuinely feels like a cheap injustice knock-off. And I don't know how they managed to do that.

I'm still playing the game obviously, I'm having to rely on blind hope that the game actually improves and begins to feel good to play, but if what I've played so far is any indicator of how bad this game is to play, then I'll have to be out, and I don't want to be out. 

What are your thoughts on the game so far? 




 It's happening a lot, but it's sporadic. Seemingly completely random. I've restarted my computer. Looked at the task manager. Looked at devices in the control panel, but saw no solution or even cause. Any help would be appreciated. 


































 Redundant text right here. 




















































































 I think I recall reading a long time ago that shattering gear in quick succession reaps bonus shards, or something.

Any kind souls willing to lay out the rules for shattering to maximise rewards? Or point me in the direction of a guide for such activities? 



















 My current favourite team is MKX Scorpion, CCBG, and ABB. The gear I use with this team is as follows.

MKX = Bone Spikes, Mark of the Tiger, and Ra's Al Ghul's Scimitar

CCBG = Carbonfiber Mask, Dark Sword, and Nullification Rifle.

ABB = Azarthian Cloak, Icebound Necklace, The Batmobile.

I know I'd be better off using the scimitar on Batgirl as he combo ender does two hits instead of one but I prefer having it on Scorpion.

My question is this. Is the Batmobile gear useless? I play online mode almost exclusively and almost never get any super's charged up. I usually just use my s2 abilities to win the fights, so is the Batmobile useless? Is it really worth it to charge up enough power to use a super (that will do splash damage) when by that point the fight is almost over and the 1 hit super is less effective than the 4 hit s2 ABB does? 



























































 The title really says it all. I'm logged in right now. Time to make up for lost... uh... time. 





























 Skyrim is my favourite game of all time. I was introduced to the series with the nearly equally amazing Oblivion.

I went back and tried to play Morrowind a couple of times. I hate that game. I hate everything about it. I don't think there's a single aspect I experienced that wasn't done better in Oblivion and Skyrim.

But hey, some people like swinging a sword and having it miss the enemy right in front of them 7 times out of 10, and that's cool, it's not for me though. 




 A solid minute of people screaming. Wish I hadn't watched that. 




 Well, they asked a question. So the question mark is justified. And the answer to the question is likely to make a lot of people very excited, so I'd say the exclamation mark is also warranted. 




  you can't instill a conscience or a moral compass in a creature that wasn't born with one

WAT? You realise most rational people acknowledge that their "moral compass" is attained by reason and empathy right? Babies aren't born with the knowledge that killing someone is wrong, that's why children have to be taught right from wrong. 




 Well. I eat meat, but it's far from being purely for survival purposes. I could easily survive as a vegetarian, but I choose to eat delicious meat.

Should I face harsh punishment for this? 




 Is it really a sneak attack if everyone was expecting some Fallout news sometime this year? 




 This shit. This shit right here is literally the very reason I will NEVER give google or youtube my phone number, no matter how many times they ask and how much they claim it's for security. 




 I thought it was Christmas, Easter, and New Year. I guess the patriotic salute would suggest the 4th of July.

 You don't need a "decent team". Just buy three silver packs and use those cards until you can with the 3rd bracket. 




 Congrats. You got the button equivalent of entering a royal rumble last. 




 Great callback. I like your style. 




 Auditions to find a 4th member for Blue Man Group weren't going well. 




 Or the ones that don't seem to have any meaning. Unless I'm missing something there's one between Sub-Zero and Kung Lao that just, doesn't make much sense (I'm probably missing something).

Kung Lao: A dead man walks.

Sub-Zero: You will feel the chill of winter.

Kung Lao: You have met your demise.

WAT?

 




 Yeah, he's gay dude. 




 I like Sub-Zero's badass statement to Jason:

"Kombat me, fool!" 




 Boy is she barking up the wrong staff. 




 They didn't cripple Sub-Zero, I can now breathe again. 









 My friends drag raced their adder and entity and the entity won repeatedly. This is fully tuned with all the mods installed of course.  




 That may be the case, but it's still embarrassingly small for the task. The major releases on PS4 average at around 25GB, some are even 50GB! And they're mandatory installs.

Then on top of that there's updates, DLC, "free" indie games, shared pictures and videos. It all adds up.

I've had the PS4 for 2 years and I've had to delete stuff to make room for new games twice, that's appalling IMO. I never once reached the capacity of my Xbox 360 or my PS3 320GB HDDs. 




 It's my favourite car in the game. I love the way it looks, the way it sounds, and the way it drives. It's got enough grip to be able to control it, but enough slide so you can have fun with it. And although it's not quite as fast as say, a Zentorno or a Turismo it can hold it's own against those cars, and it's a fraction of the cost.

Love it. 




 Yup. I made a rare misspelling, and I really couldn't be bothered to correct it. Glad you sill knew what I meant.  




 My plan worked.  




 My mistake. I read it as unattractive. Now I see that word isn't in the title, and so my post makes no sense. Damn, got to be more careful in the future. 




 It sure is.

But your claim that the machine will take any HDD that's 7.5mm in height intrigues me and I wish to subscribe to your news letter. Since I've had to clear space on my 500GB HDD twice in the two years I've had the system I might have to look into this.

 this just makes it look less ugly.

Less ugly? Than what? A lepor? 




 How to make your pS4 look like it's got a hideous cyst in one easy step.

Seriously though, I always said the paltry 500gb HDD the PS4 shipped with was embarrassingly small, surely a ploy to get the sales of Sony's HDDs up. 




 It used to mean something. People used to want it because it shows great timing to wait for it to hit red and then get it.

But for the last couple of weeks it's been so fucking easy to get red it defeats the point. There's no challenge, no risk. Hence red is now the third most common flair.

I'm glad I got my orange flair because I had good timing, anyone with a red flair is just seen as someone who waited until it was impossible miss getting it. 




 Genius. 




 I agree with everything you just said, have for a long time. But my question remains. I guess that's the "Greater Good" response in a nutshell. In order for me to agree with you about the problem of evil I first must make the assumption that god follows the laws of logic. and I'm not sure if I can make that assumption. This is why I can't say for sure that he doesn't exist.


Edit: I've just done some reading over at Foxhole atheist regarding greater good theodicies and I have come to this conclusion. If the god of the bible is bound by the laws of logic (and until demonstrated otherwise we have to assume  that he is) then no, he cannot possibly exist.

I guess I'm an agnostic atheist or a gnostic atheist depending on the god in question. Thanks for the education ;)

Have an imaginary internet point that does not exist. 




 I guess.

Have a nice day, man. 




 Fair enough, assuming the god of the bible has the same morality most of us do, which it seems he doesn't.

Can we be sure that what we consider to be evil is the same as what god would consider evil? If god is the supposed author of morality could it be possible that if he does exist, we simply don't see that what he allows to happen is ultimately "good"? God's plan/mysterious ways etc etc.


I can't believe I'm actually arguing for the plausibility of the existence of god.

I feel dirty.



 




  That way I don't know if a God exists, that makes me an agnostic

An agnostic atheist, like me. Agnostic and atheist aren't mutually exclusive. You can have agnostic theists and gnostic atheists.

You don't know if an invisible fairy exists
You don't know if an invisible mammoth exists.
You don't know if an invisible whatever exists.
Should we have names like 'agnostic' for all of these ?

Nope, because the belief in any of those doesn't have real world consequences like believing in a god does. There are laws in various countries around the world that are religiously based, or religiously inspired.

I don't see any fairy laws dictating what people can and can't do. 

Nothing can break them.

People who believe in a god would beg to differ.

Believing in God is scientific ignorance

Of course it is, and yet billions of people still believe. 




 I guess we're talking about the god of the bible. You speak of negative claims and how they don't need to have any kind of backing up. What would you say to "There's isn't not a god"? Or what if someone said "The sun did not rise this morning"? I'd ask them to back up that negative claim.

It's reasonable to make a negative claim without evidence until there IS evidence for the positive claim

Is that not just absence of evidence though? We don't know he does exist, therefore he doesn't. 




 Yes it does. But claiming "God does not exist" as a fact is just as folly as saying "God exists", because you can't (currently) prove either one to be true. 




 There's a difference between not believing a claim, and proposing a counter claim.

I don't believe that there's an invisible fairy dancing on your back, but it's possible to feel your back and tell there's no fairy there. If you then say it's intangible and I have no way of detecting it, I can say I don't believe there's a fairy on your back, but I can't prove there isn't, and so I can't truthfully say that there is literally no dancing fairy on your back, because I can't possibly know that for sure because of the characteristics of the fairy in question i.e. it's undetectable.

The same goes for god. If you say "There is no god", the burden of proof is then on you to prove that your claim is true.

God breaks the laws of physics

How do you know for a fact that there exists no being in existence that can break the laws of physics? Can you prove no such being exists? If you can I'd love to hear it. If you can't, then you can't truthfully claim no such being exists.

and has zero evidence of him existing

[Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence_of_absence)

 




 Well. Someone made a claim, that claim is "God exists."

Have you been convinced that the claim is true? If not, you don't believe. If you've been presented with a claim, the fact that you don't give it any thought doesn't change the fact that you either believe it to be true, or don't believe it.

I agree that right now we can't prove either way whether a god exists or not, but the discussion is still worth having because religion is a large part of many countries, and often can have tangible effects on laws and people under those laws.

You don't have to disprove god to not believe he exists, you simply have to remain unconvinced of the statement's truth. Which I am. 




 OP didn't ask if you knew god existed or not, they asked if you believe.

Agnosticism/gnosticism address what you know (or claim to know).
Atheism/theism address what you believe. 




  That would be illogical.

How so? 




  It makes me wonder what kind of loving God would allow that.

Have you read the Bible? The stuff god supposedly allows is entirely abhorrent. I don't why anyone would want to worship a morally bankrupt fiend like that. 




 There is no God.

Unfortunately you just made a claim, can you back it up with evidence? Reasonably the best anyone can say is "I don't think there is a god." Outright saying "There is no good" places the burden of proof onto you, and if you can be sure there's no god then you must have some pretty compelling evidence.

I'm an atheist by the way. 




 I don't believe for a very simple reason.

Every single claim that a god exists that has ever been posited by anyone in all history has failed to meet it's [burden of proof](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophic_burden_of_proof).

Every, single, one. 




 Apostrophes are simple, right?

 How many times do I have to explain this? I'm not saying the video is shit. I'm not saying the video is boring, or unwanted, or lame, or anything like that.

All I am doing (read this next bit carefully because it's the most important part) is disputing OP's claim that this clip took a staggering amount of coordination.

How is this hard to understand? I liked the video. It's cool and amusing, no-one's disputing the quality of the video. I'm disputing the claim OP made as to how difficult this was to pull off.

Perhaps we have differing definitions of the word staggering. My point has been made as clearly as I can possibly make it. 




 The reason I stuck with the GM was because the unbreakable was utterly useless in jumping opponents, in the ice clone will freeze a jumping attack enemy, plus you can still move while its out.  




 I don't think you can. Unless there's a mod that allows you to make all NPC's give the finger.  




 I'm not in an organised crew, nor do I have any friends who still play the game. I also don't have the rockstar director so it would be hard for me to replicate it. This still doesn't mean it takes a staggering amount of coordination. Any half serious crew could manage it with minimal effort.  




 Very good video. Glad to see people uploading videos that actually teach us stuff instead of merely showing us.  




 I started by using the unbreakable variation because it looked the coolest, and no-one uses it. Some guy was watching my stream/coaching me and he said is benefit greatly from making the switch to GM variation. I've never looked back. 

Shame his only costume flair is that dull medallion. I miss the ice mask :( 




 Why not? If the shop is open its open. Obviously people who get in at the last minute and then take their time need a kick up the arse, but if they're quick and speedy I see no problem with it.  




 I'm not saying it isn't cool and amusing, it is. I'm just saying it likely didn't require a staggering amount of coordination.  




 Why does it look like is was taken in the 70's? 




 Not if they're friends/a crew. It would be incredibly easy. If it's randoms then yeah it would be tricky, but I have no doubt that these players are friends and/or part of the same crew, in which case it's not impressive in the least. 




 Genuine miracles.

lol. 




 Is it really stunning though? All they had to do was have one guy say: "OK guys. Let's all look left and give the middle finger for about 5 seconds."

Seems like it would have taken a very small amount of coordination to me. 




 It's a disaster movie... and you thought it was going to be good? 




 Seriously? I wait weeks for the challenge to appear and it's only here for a fucking day? I'm really struggling to think of reasons to keep playing at this point. So much bullshit going on all the time. 




 I just looked to see what I did to unlock him, apparently you get him for reaching rank 50 with a faction.

This is strange because I've reach rank 50 with 3 factions so far, and it took this long to unlock him? Weird.

 I can totally believe it. If "Yummy Mummy" is in the dictionary, anything can be. 




 Still, I just re-watched the trailer (hence the door smashing comment) and it seems pretty true to the gameplay of the final product. It's especially impressive given game trailers of recent years.

Wait, did I just imply that 2012 wasn't a recent year? whatever, you know what I mean ;)

 The Jacqui spamming machine gun move is hard to beat with out a teleport move, at least that's in my experience. 




  You know what they're going to do every single time, and you can beat it easily

As Sub Zero I always have trouble with Full Auto Jacqui machine gun spammers. Sure I can slide, but I need to make it perfect to avoid all the bullets, and that's hard. Sure I can use an EX slide, but then they go right back to spamming. The only way round this that I've found is to duck then quickly step forward and duck again, inching my way towards them. I guess it unnerves them into trying something else and then FFFFFWWOOOOOOOSSHSHHH! slide.

Edit: Downvoted for sharing my experience. Wow, this subreddit continues to display itself as the most hostile one I've been subbed to thus far. 




 How cute, they're small. 




 I don't look for reasons to be upset, the reasons find me. 




 Whoa whoa now, take it Eazy-E. There's no need 2-Chainz the subject like that, and that's the way it is. I wouldn't expect anyone to Bow Wow at my feet.

Oh my tired Akon bones. I knew I shouldn't have been testing out my new DMX at the skate park earlier, those things are Common anyway. I think I'll give it up like I just don't care before I Busta hip or something, then my leg would get all Puffy and I'd have to put a really big Ice Cube on it to dull the T-Pain.

I went to see the Dr. Dre for a check up and he told me there'd be a Diddy fee. Which was nice because I was expecting something B.I.G.

50 Cent is all he charged me, as thanks I bought him a 2-Pac of his favourite beer and a sole Eminem, a blue one. He asked me "How Kanye be doing this for me? I'm just working my Method, Man."

I replied "Pharrell the times you've healed me, made me feel better about myself. The least I can do is Snoop around your facebook page, see what beer and candy you like. It's not like I bought you a Gucci Mane bag or anything."

And then I left. I knew he'd be watching every step I take, and every move I make, and I knew today was gonna be a good day.

Iggy Azalea. 




  but you could've went in expecting a little more because of the amount of hype around it.

The same can be said about anything people praise. It's nearly impossible to hear everyone raving about something and not build up some expectations in your mind. 




 I've seen different bosses have different sized health bars. I'm assuming they have millions of HP and everyone has to fight as much as they can to collectively drain the health bar before the invasion is over.

That's how it seems to me. 




 He was a character on Noel Edmond's House Party. I'm assuming you're not from Britain, it was a pretty big Saturday (or Sunday) night show over here back in the 90's. Everyone loved it.

Sometimes Mr Blobby would show up and basically harass Noel, much to the audience's amusement. Looking back on it though, my parents must have fucking hated every second the pink freak was on TV, but us kids loved it.

Just watch this episode I just found and you'll see what we had to put up with on the weekend. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leSGbxejtvw 




 Whenever I'm in a fast car and the cops are doing their keeping up bullshit I just look behind me, throw a sticky bomb out the window, and solve the problem. 




 Because I find the whole thing to be ridiculous. It's ludacris. 




 I know how you feel. I think the whole concept is ridiculous anyway.

"Look at how much money I have! Look at all the women I paid to be in my video! HUr durr!"

Seriously, who's impressed by the showing off rappers do? 




 I wholeheartedly and unabashedly LOL at everyone who was waiting expecting to be rewarded.

Should have pressed the button you fools. 




 But what about the hype of literally every person who's seen it? I've heard nothing but "It's the best action movie in years!" from everyone. 




 'twas all the rage when I was a kid. He hails from Crinkley Bottom. I'm not making this up. 




 Me too. I was all like "Wow, it's cool seeing so much of Outworld. This whole war between Kotal Khan and Mileena is going to be... welp, rebellion's over." 




 [Mr Blobby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XutaTTNihe0) 




 Arkham Origins rated games? That'll not make Rocksteady happy. 




 People still have trouble with raven? Get her below 50% health and hit her with a super move.

Literally problem solved. 




 I'm willing to do something 99% of my console gaming brethren are too afraid to do.

Acknowledge that PC is objectively the superior gaming platform. 




 Don't let me go belly up! 




 They finally pulled their fingers out and released challenge mode? I might have to start playing again. Frankly I'm amazed at how quickly I got bored of this game considering I played Injustice almost every day for nearly two years. 




 I remember when this game first came out and everyone was equating the cops with Ed-209 from Robocop, on account of how dangerous they were compared to the cops in GTAIV.

Now we're all accustomed to their ways it's gotten pretty easy to make them look foolish/take them down without issue. Good job OP. You showed those fucks who owns the streets! 




 TIL welling up equates to breaking down, if OP is to be believed. 




 It's funny. When I initially started going for the trophy I thought it was insanely hard. It's cool to see so many different tactics being employed to achieve the same goal. 




 Sorry if this is old news or there's better known ways of landing hits on the invasion bosses. I just found a tactic that worked for me and wanted to share it with people who might be having trouble, like I was. 









 Yes. Everyone. James himself even said people say he looks like House.  




 People who can do this have my respect. I'm a pretty decent pilot in GTA, and I've never successfully flown upside down through a tunnel. 

And I've tried.  




 I've been told by several people that the price of building a PC in the UK is much higher than for US gamers. If I want to play games at 4K I'm looking at around 700, more than double a PS4's cost.  




 Oh yeah, that thing. Thanks for clarifying.  




 What? 




 Not everyone wants/likes/can afford to play in PC. It's all well and good claiming PC gaming is cheaper in the long run but there's still the hurdle of the steep entry fee. 

But I guess this all moo because we'll never know.  




 What is this? r/nocontext 




 It's fine. You just have to be careful. You can turn on the spot if you're careful. 




 The game's been out for nearly 2 years and you learned this today? 




  If we eliminated that, we would have the same amount of gamers with better systems

Or you would have fewer gamers. You can't possibly state one way or the other. 




 I may be late, but 141 people enjoyed the post. And I never said Kotal wasn't a better character, I enjoy listening to him talk. 




 [It's a Simpsons quote.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlMwc1c0HRQ) 




 You know much of Outworld. 




  To be fair though, people are fucking idiots. 




 Hmm. Your ideas intrigue me, and I wish to subscribe to your newsletter. 




 Upvoted for Herperlarp. 




 You'll forgive me if I haven't thought about Ogre for many years and so he wasn't at the forfront of my memory. 




 I find that sort of thing seems to be pretty frowned upon in /r/mortalkombat 

A lot of people seem really hostile in this subreddit, at least in my experience. 




 I understand. Outworld law states that the offending party be subjected to hanging their head in shame for no less than 15 seconds. 

**hangs head in shame** 




 I though he was a sun/blood God.  




 I wouldn't be surprised if they were both based on than.  




 Thanks! Stan Lee once said every comic is somebody's first time reading one. I think the same can be said for most posts to reddit. 




 He's "The God of Fighting". He's pretty powerful. 




 I get that many people do. I was just saying that I don't. I know nothing about Dota 2, that's probably why I didn't recognise him. Thanks for the clarification. 




 Just noticed the spelling mistake in the title. Sorry guys. 




 I have no idea who that is. 




 But that isn't even Ogre's final form! 




 Well it's the first time I've seen it posted to reddit. Sorry for lacking the ability to see every post made to the MK subreddit. 




 Takeda isn't exactly my main. And I dropped a few combos here I shouldn't have, but it's still pretty tricky to go two rounds without being hit at all, even blocking.

Sorry I'm not MLG like yourself. 









 Are these comics canon with the games? 









 Nice. Loving the Noob rep also. 




 I just spotted the time played. I'm pretty sure I've played more than 2 horus and 50 minutes lol. Unless that's 2 days and 50 hours. 




 Yeah. I once went to bed and woke up with a higher rank, that's why I'm not sure how accurate the rank is. 









 Username checks out. 




 Of course. I keep forgetting games on PC are much cheaper. 




 Good to know, thanks. 




 Don't worry. You won't be seeing that kind of post from me again lol. 




 Yeah sorry for my snarky reply earlier. A little understandable given your comment but my attitude wasn't necessary. I had a quick scan of your past comments to see if you're a dick but it looks like you're a decent guy, that's why I feel bad for being an ass to you earlier. 




 Cool. Thanks for clarifying. 




 Ok. Sorry to be dragging down the community by asking a question. I'll be sure to delete this post so I avoid making this subreddit go to shit any more than it supposedly has.

Note to self. Don't ever ask the Reddit MK community a question ever again. They apparently hate that shit. 




 Telling me to block everything the enemy throws at me is much easier than actually blocking everything. 




 Thanks for the tips. I main Sub-Zero so I usually slide in after the minion instead of running.

Also, fuzzy block? 




 No. I understand the benefit of knowing one's enemy. I'm just saying that if I'm going to learn a character I might as well use them. 




 If all they do is teleport then yeah, easy. The people I fight do much more than teleport. 




 And you clearly haven't read the comments. If you had you'd have seen that this issue has been remedied. I should probably delete this post then shouldn't I? 




 I do use the blocking mechanic. But there's this other mechanic called mix-ups. They kinda make it hard to block sometimes. And once you're hit, that's it, 34% of your life bar, gone, because a little tap to the foot opened you up. 




 There's no way I'd put the time and effort into learning a character and then just not use them. 




 Yeah man. I rarely lol when I'm alone. It's usually just the huff of air out the nostrils.

But I lol'd twice during this and thought, that's redditworthy. 









 Thanks. That mouse looks awesome. Lights for some reason! 




 Just thought of a question. I looked at a review video for the monitor and it seems a little, small. I'm used to gaming on a TV that I think is pushing the 48 inch range. I could always buy a bigger monitor later, but is hooking the PC up to my TV a viable option? People always tell me it's a thing you can do but when I hook my laptop up to the TV the picture quality seems to drop. 




 Thanks for the info. I read that I don't want a weak CPU because it can slow down the GPU, is this much of an issue?

Also I keep hearing the term benchmark but don't know what that is in terms of computing.  




 Yeah I suppose if I learned his moves of be better equipped to fight him. I've just been avoiding learning him because everyone uses him and I don't want to add to that. And if I know him I have to use him, that's the law.  




 Thanks man, this is exactly the kind of thing I was looking for. I'll be keeping this somewhere safe. 




 Thanks man, this is exactly the kind of thing I was looking for. I'll be keeping this somewhere safe. 




 Oh yeah. I always forget about the online fees since I've been paying them for so long. 




 Ah yes. I see the rule you mean now. This is how much of a noob I am. I assumed /r/buildapcforme was where people would literally build a pc to the specs you ask for, and /r/buildapc was where people suggested builds for you. Now I know. 




 Here's the new post for you to follow if you wish.

http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/36uuvt/absolute_noob_finally_making_the_jump_from/ 




 **What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.**

I want to play games that look better than on my PS4 (Witcher 3, GTAV, that sort of thing). Ultra settings would be nice but I have no idea how expensive that is, so high would suffice if the cost is over my budget. I'd also like to do some light video editing and rendering using Sony Vegas.

**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** 

700

**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** 

I don't know when I'll be buying. I'm looking to get an idea of what I'll be buying since I know nothing about the innards of PCs.

**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc)** 

This will be from scratch so I guess I'd need a tower, OS, one monitor, speakers, keyboard, mouse. Not sure what else I'd need.

**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** 

England.

**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.** 

None.

**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** 

I have no idea. I guess so. I thought everyone overclocked gaming PCs.

**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**

"RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL" I don't know what any of that is. I'd like an SSD but they're mega expensive. I'd need at least 2TB of storage for all the games I reckon.

**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**

Not yet. Just trying to get an idea of what I need. 

**Do you need a copy of Windows 7 or 8.1 included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference for one or the other?**

I guess I'll need windows. I've got 8.1 on my laptop but I much preferred 7, that metro stuff is just annoying. Is there a benefit to using older versions?

**Extra info or particulars:**

I am a noob. Please remember this when saying things like "Radeon 9500 GTX" and "i7 quad core". 




 The second rule I see is:

No facilitating piracy, linking to pirated software or tools to pirate software

I guess there's more than 1 set of rules? But yeah, I'm going to post this over at /r/buildapcforme as suggested by another redditor. 
 




 I'm going to post it in /r/buildapcforme because someone suggested it would be better off there. I'll give you the link once I've posted it. 




 Cool. Thanks for letting me know. I'll post it there. 




 Let's assume the PC version ran just as well as the console versions. What would be the advantage of getting the PC version? I know the advantage to PC versions of most games (better graphics, higher framerate, mods etc) but since MKX looks great on consoles and runs at 60fps, what's the advantage to the PC version? 




 That's strange. I never say things like Dat Ass because I think it's dumb. But I see so many top comments saying dat ass I figured it was something people enjoyed reading. But of course. I made the mistake of thinking reddit makes sense, so when I say it, downvotes, when other people say it, upvotes.

Fuck reddit sometimes.  




 Cool. Me too.  




 Which Soul Calibur game was Kratos in? I only know of:

Soul Calibur 2: Xbox = Spawn
PS2 = Heihachi
Gamecube = Link

and Soul Calibur 4.

PS3 = Darth Vader
Xbox 360 = Yoda

and Soul Calibur V

All versions = Ezio. 




  I just play wired for a bit.

Nothing like a bit of retro gaming lol. 




 Yeah, sorry for my dickish comment. I've become everything I used to hate about reddit lol. 




 That's terrible. 




 When you put it like that, it does seem kind of oxymoronic. I was just angry when I started the post and chilled out near the end. 




 Fair enough. 




 Yup. She became a gamer around the time she bought an Xbox 360 in 2010 ish. She keeps surprising me. She owns a Five Finger Death Punch Album... she's 55. She loves playing games like Skyrim, Fallout, and most recently, X-Com Enemy Unknown and she just finished Deus Ex Human Revolution.

It's cool. 




 Noice! 




 I'm sure the Xbox One controllers do have a great life span. I know the Xbox 360 did, but then again the tradeoff was that you had to buy batteries and keep swapping them out when they need charging. With my PS4  I have a dock that holds two controllers. When one gets low on power I simply turn it off, place it down, pick up the other one and keep playing. I will agree that the battery life on the PS4 controllers is embarrassingly short, but 4 hours is doing it a disservice. 




 It's almost as if the stuff bundled with collector's editions of games is cheap tat!

I remember when my Mum opened her collector's edition of Elder Scrolls Online and pulled out the statue of Molag Bal. A statue we'd assumed would have been made from metal given the price of the fucking package.

NOPE.

It was cheap as fuck plastic. I've heard the same from people with other collector's editions. This is why I don't buy collector's editions. Mostly because I don't want the shit that comes with them, I just want the game, but partly because I've been nothing but underwhelmed with what I've seen so far.

Did anyone get the collector's edition of Black Ops with the RC-XD? Or the CE of Modern Warfare 2 with the night vision goggles? what was the build quality like on those? Also the Scorpion statue with MKX. 
























 What do you mean "shitty on purpose"? Why? 




  totally worth it

What was the benefit of pre-ordering it? I've always seen it as a waste of time. It's not like not pre-ordering makes you not get the game. 




 You must get tired of saying that, lol. 




 Or maybe the kid was taught to be nice to people. 




 Looks to me like he does have a leg. Explain yourself, OP. 




 Yes. Yes we have.

This ending was part of the reason some people believed Reiko to be Shao Khan. This has since been dismissed as false. 




 So when BAE (whatever the fuck that's meant to mean, I'm assuming it's girlfriend) is home a random guy runs over two other random guys with a golf buggy? 




 Not me. I always make sure my character specialises in either destruction or archery, for this exact reason.

I thought everyone did that. 




 Is it just me, or is Uwe Boll known for making fucking terrible films? I mean really fucking bad movies. 




 Quite lucky. Also, awesome grandad for having a HDPVR.  









 Wow. You must have been rich. Now at could I afford to buy anything over 100 when I was in school.  




 He didn't get his finger bit off. His finger was bitten off.  




 These guys have been through some shit. Sorry they're not ugly bags of steroids as seems to be your preference. 




 What would you say is a good game? 




 Considering each character is 3.99 I was expecting at the very least 2 costumes per character. Very disappoint.  




 Is the guy who voiced that bad guy the same guy who voiced Fatman in Metal Gear Solid 2? Sounded like him at times.  




 Hackers can be funny sometimes. Take this fella for example. http://youtu.be/zWV5CcR2EY0 




 No I never mixed my substances. Maybe it did dilate the pupils as you say, but because I was doing pills around the same time period that made my pupils really dilate the coke dilation wasn't as noticeable. 




 Yeah. Either him or Freeman. I've never thought much of Gordon Freeman he has no character. All he does is kill things with guns (mostly) just like the rest do, except they've got character.

Well, I'm not sure if MC has any character. But at least MC wasn't partly responsible for the crisis he has to stop like Gordon was, lol.  




 Cocaine never caused my eyes to dilate back when I dabbled with it, ecstasy did though. Jesus Christ. 

Left all that shit in the past.  




 Daedric armour is awesome looking and I'll not hear otherwise!

**places fingers in ears**

Lalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalallal 




 I don't believe this. I've never seen a leaderboard in a mobile game that wasn't topped by blatant cheaters with impossible scores.  




 Then that kid needs glasses.  




 At the start of the game it's accurate, if you're not wearing iron armour and bulging with muscles.

At the end Of the game it's just fucking dumb. But then again every time a kid in skyrim opens their mouth it pisses me off. Little shits.  




 Maybe only humans can be an expendable. Yes I know chief isn't entirely human but whatever.  




 You'd rather see Marcus than who? I think Marcus is awesome too.  




 It sounds like he's taking issue with the fact that I mentioned I'd seen it before. Like I was saying it to get some sort of false sense of superiority or some shit.  




 Depends on how much he ingested and how strong it was.  




 I have no idea. I'm. Not involved in the project.  




 On consoles? Unlikely.  




 That's just like, your opinion man.  




 In fairness daedric armour looks awesome and badass.

Different opinions eh? 




 In real life yeah, but in the land of Tamriel seeing someone running at you wearing that is usually the last thing you do. 




 console.modless 




 That sounds awesome. Bethesda should implement that into console versions. 




 Skyrim is a fairly racist land. I doubt other races have kids there. 




 Doesn't work on console though does it? 




 If I was out in the wilds of skyrim and someone started running at me in daedric armour I'd be scared. My character wouldn't, but I would.  




 Then they're wrong. My high elf was bulging with muscles and powerful magical energies. He looks tough no matter what he's wearing.  




 Thanks. Glad I could make you smile.  




 It was either him or be ruled by the Scots. We chose the lesser of two evils.  




 Disregard my previous comment. I just realised the use of the word flaming could cause some confusion/jokes.  




 Just like the expendables.  




  It he died having the time of his life.  




 I know! I've always been sure that they wouldn't be such cocky little shits if they knew they weren't indestructible.  




 I just wanted to let him know that I have enjoyed that gif in the past, and now he allowed me to enjoy it again today.

And that makes me a weirdo? 




 Exactly.  




 Skyrim is always relevant.



Until Elsweyr comes out of course.  




 It's so you can't fuck up quests. They should give you an option to turn off mission specific NPC's invincibility.  




 I've never seen an edgy teenage look anything like someone wearing daedric armour. I'm glad I don't have your vision.  




 I wasn't swinging it around, I walked past her and she felt compelled to comment. Is swinging a flaming sword now associated with homosexuality? I have trouble keeping with kid's mentalities these days.  




 RIP Uncle Buck. 




 People still associate the word coloured with race? Seriously though my parents sometimes still say coloured when referring to black people. I always make a point to them about how old that makes them sound. 




 Not on console :( 




 Cool! 




 Leon? 




 Feel the rhyme! 




 Does it? What makes you say that? It's an edited version of the box art. 




 No worries mate. 




 I was 8 when it came out, I guess that may have coloured my opinion of the film forever. 




 Shhshshh!! Get out of here with your lies!

Seriously though I was pretty certain that although I made that up on the spot I wasn't the first person to say it. It sounded to good to be something I was the first to say. 




 "Ya mon." 




 You think Titanic is far better than Cool Runnings? Get out! 




 Differing opinions then. I don't care for war films, especially WW2 films. 




  I'm going to go to my parents house and see if I can dig up the old VHS and a player. My girlfriend is not going to be pleased on our next "date night".

That's cool but... why not just watch a digital version? 




 when my friend showed me how to kick with both feet at the same time in Duke Nukem 3D it blew my mind. One of the few memories I have of Duke. 




 I think you're simply reading too much into what is at the very least a bad joke. 




   they need the contrasting personality

I disagree. They just need to be able to kick an insane amount of ass and look great doing it. I think these guys qualify. 




 Truthfully? 




 No I don't want to kiss your egg! 




 Haven't seen that in a while. Thanks for the laugh. 




 Was Arnie expendable in Predator?

Was Stallone expendable in Rambo?

Was Statham expendable in Mean Machine?

It's not a post made to ahdere to the strict definition of the word expendable. It's merely a reference to the recent action films starring people who've seen a ton of action in their films, as these characters have seen a ton of action in their games. If you were to enter battle, I'm pretty sure you'd be happy to have these guys in there with you. 




 I guess they only included people known for being in good games. I know a couple of Duke game are good but he is kinda known for being in shitty games at this point. Forever was the final nail in the coffin. 




 Hard times make hard people.

Just made that up, copyright Alex Harper! 




 You've seen what before. The gif? My post? The comment I made? I'm assuming it's the comment I made since you quoted it. Are you upset that you've seen those words arranged in that order previously in your life? 




 Yeah man, it certainly wasn't a comedy.

Jk. I actually quite like that film. 









 Agreed. 




 I haven't seen it for many years. 




  but is actually quite loosely based on the true events

So like pretty much every other film that's based on true events. 




 Perhaps I should have included the word "truthfully" in the title. 




 I did, except nearly half of them are unkillable. I had to reload. 




 Enjoy ;) 




 No I don't want to kiss your lucky egg! 




 I work in the Thom Building. 




 I see a man who won't take no crap, from no-one! 




 Apology accepted. I only hope the rampant aggression and rudeness displayed in this comment doesn't become a regular thing.

Nobody needs that. 




 Love that gif. Always have. I imagine the two scenarios being incredibly similar. 




 Playing on console you can't kill kids :(

I tried of course, once. I had to reload when the only NPCs left in Whiterun were the invincible ones. 




 It's Cool Runnings. 




 Cool Runnings. 







































 For quick clips I'll use the share button on the PS4. For actual produced videos I'll use my Hauppauge HDPRV Gaming 2. 




 Mudcrabs, confirmed! 




 Hey, I'm a millennial (if by millenial you mean someone born between 10980 and 2000), and I had to remember my friend's phone numbers as a kid.

Edit: I meant "1980 and 2000". Not "10980 and 2000". Lol. 




 If that's the case then we can safely ignore it forever. I can't think of anything more useless than an endless countdown clock. 




 Didn't look like any sea I've seen. 




 It's called a househusband. 




 Not exist. It's pretty weird that she does that. 




 ...aaaaaand committed to memory. 




 Exactly. Fuck all the trolls saying "Fallout 4 looks last gen!"

Bitch, have you played Fallout 3 on PS3? Compare that to the Fallout 4 trailer and shut the hell up. 




 144p

Now there's a resolution I've not seen in a long time. 




 Because they like meat, but they don't want to be involved with the process of slaughtering them, down to the consumer level. 




 I'm not involved with the project so I don't know the details I'm afraid. It seems pretty quick to be real time, I assume it's sped up a little, but it might not be. This is just displayed on one of the monitors in reception. 




 And the textures set to "Almost existing, but not quite." 




 That was awesome. 




 This is cool. The fact I can tell who they're meant to represent without any real facial features is a testament to your skill.

But who's the blue guy? James with a bit of chin fluff? 














 They'd definitely tell if there was a prize 

If you knew what the prize was you'd realise how dumb that sounds. 




 I don't know how well the characters in Mortal Kombat are balanced, they seem pretty balanced to me.

Putting in characters with one variation would surely mess all that up? 




 I was thinking maybe the 111 meant a November the 11th release date perhaps why not.  




 Not better people, just people that can do their job without resorting childish insults. I don't know, it just looks like something you'd find happening on a primary school playground.  




 )

Found it. 




 This is why I stay out of politics. They're all so childish. It's crazy to see how juvenile the people who run the country are in the house of commons. 




 Here you go, friend.

http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/388f2p/in_paypals_new_terms_of_service_effective_july_1/crtygac?context=3 




 Sorry! Fixed.  




 Then they can stop asking for it.  




 But the terms of the contract are that they can spam you, if you close your account you're ending the contract so it should void their ability to spam, right? 




 I'd be willing to bet that if you close your account and therefore end any contract between you and them they can't legally spam you. 




 Good job I made mine years ago then. 




 I'll use an xray at the end of a combo if I can. 




 I agree. With Tanya she has a fatality where she stomps through their midsection and creates a hole just like the one Scorpion's fireball fatality does. Then she stomps through their face and leaves a hole identical to the one Jacqui leaves when she punches through. When Jacqui does that you can see some embers on the inside of the enemy's head, presumably because she used some kind of shot to boost the attack (gunpowder scorches?).

But when Tanya stomps through their face you can also see embers/orange glowing. Just makes it feel a little lazy when you see so many repeated gore effects. 




  but I think everyone goes "How would that not kill you?!"

Yeah I hear that a lot. I have to remind them that 75% of ALL moves in MKX would probably kill you. 




 I prefer the current one he employs. It's the most cinematic one by far, the way they fly up the camera, the clouds, the crazy electrical discharge coming from Raiden, it's so badass. 




 And the second I start getting that shit form them I'm shutting my account down. 




 Good point well presented. 




 You'd think so. I imagine very specific lighting is required for the illusion to work. 




 How little we've actually advanced. 




 What makes you think it's anything like Bordrlands? Other than it being first person with guns of course.

I think it'll play a lot like Fallout 3. I like to look at it like this. Skyrim made improvements over Oblivion in almost every aspect but sill retained the essence (IMO), I think Fallout 4 will be to Fallout 3 what Skyrim was to Oblivion. 




 [This one](http://static2.uk.businessinsider.com/image/556df97edd089502528b45d2-800-600/illusion-2.jpg) is simple yet effective.

But [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORoTCBrCKIQ) remains a mind fuck to this day. Wow the human senses are so easily fooled. 




 The Catholic Church. They can do whatever the fuck they want, including facilitating child rape, and get away with it. 




 They just have no fucking concept of health and safety laws over there. 




 This is one remaster collection I'm willing to buy.

I bought the first game (just before the third one was released) and it was better than I thought. I initially thought it looked kind of shitty to be honest, like a poor man's Tomb Raider.

Never got around to playing the others, this would be good to have before the release of the 4th one, which I plan on buying. 




 I remember this happening a while back. People were saying she was drunk or high on her meds or something, and that the guy shouldn't be goading on. he's fishing for a reaction. Sure she's the crazy bitch, but he wasn't helping the situation.

I think everyone's favourite part was when she called him an atheist muslim. 




 As long as I can still somehow connect to the internet I'd show them my phone.

And I'd be burned at the stake.

 I thought the default response to this image was "I ain't got no panties on!" 




 The ability to not be cuntish to one another. 




 I read the title as "Capybara Enjoying Butt Snakes in the Park".

I was expecting something... different. 




 I think the default respsone to these questions is to mix it in with bowls of muesli. 




 This advert was the first time I heard this song, and I like it. It just keeps elevating as it goes on.

 I figured you'd have known from the stereotype. It's a stereotype of British people, I'm English.

 There's a really fine line between bravery and stupidity. The only distinguishing factor between the two is success. 




 If you're terrified of death you should probably not be in the army lol. Seriously. It would be like being an arachnologist while have arachnophpbia.

I think you either need to come to terms with the notion of death or change career. 




 Tipping isn't weird, expecting a tip is weird. We understand that American employers like to (and are allowed to) pay their staff fuck-all under the premise that the tips will make their wage fair.

Over here our waiters/waitresses are paid properly so tips are literally nothing more than a bonus. For this reason most people (myself included) only tip when they feel they received service that went above and beyond merely taking my order and bringing me my food. if the waiter/waitress goes out of their way to make my dining experience as enjoyable as reasonably possible I'll leave a tip. Fuck up my order? Any chance of a tip goes out the window.

I should clarify, if I'm in America I'll tip because I understand that it's expected over there. On the flip side, Americans are always welcomed by waiting staff over here because their tipping habits make them seem extremely generous :) 




 We all have terrible teeth.

To be fair, I kind of support this stereotype. Due to years of eating too much junk food, drinking too many fizzy drinks, and smoking, my teeth aren't yellow, but they're far form bright white.

Also when I was much younger I nearly got braces but complained my way out of it. I wish I'd had braces, my teeth aren't all sorts of fucked up, but they could be more aligned. 




 Didn't you know? Outdoor Hoga is all the rage right now. 




 Acting seriously is relatively easier than being funny. 




 This was on the front page all day yesterday.

I checked out my paypal account (I hardly use it but it's good for the occasional online purchase). Luckily I never gave them my mobile number, for reasons just like this. This is why google and youtube will also never receive my phone number.

Edit: closed off that pesky parenthesis.  




 So... basically " Make your dreams come true! DO IT!!!" 




 Because it's 08:10am and I have a job. 




 I brushed my teeth this morning.

Entirely believable, but a lie nonetheless. 




 So the marketing worked on you. Money well spent. 




 Uh... I think you took a wrong turn at Albuquerque, we're not Imgur. 




 I'm on reddit daily and I can say today was the first time I've seen it. You should take the Stan Lee approach to reddit posts.

Every post is someone's first time seeing it. 




 I don't think it's unreasonable to get at least 1 alternate costume for characters you have to pay extra for. The fact that Goro, Jason, and Tanya only have one costume each has disappointed me. 




 I think you may be right lol.  




 To all the people saying it looks last gen. Go play fallout 3 on a console and then realise how foolish those words are.  




 So... there's a vault dweller... and he has a dog.

Could this be a true sequel? Playing as your character from last gen with dog meat in tow? Probably not, but the end of the trailer was too similar to the end of Fallout 3 to be coincidence right?

RIGHT? 




 All I can see is the please stand by message. 




  a play through with no commentary on youtube.

I actually made that for the main game a couple of years back. Yeah, I guess the story is the main draw, might as well watch it. 




 Depends on how much weight you want to lose, how quickly your body produces sperm, and how often you can offload it.

 Oh shit, I don't think  ican top this.

 If you were replying to someone called Vulpes Inculta I'm pretty sure they'd be just as excited as you for this news. 




 But Ronald McDonald killing something with a shotgun, so it balances out. 




 Women are required to wear a hijab, men are not. What's that if not sexist? 




 Long story short I have 8 in my PSN wallet and Left Behind is 7.99. I loved playing The Last Of Us on PS3 once, tried a second playthrough but didn't really feel it. How does Left Behind stack up against the full game?

Is it horse armour or The Ballad of Gay Tony? 




 Saw it yesterday on reddit. 




 This is as bad as my friend when he said the reason sunsets are orange is BECAUSE THE SUN LITERALLY GOES ORANGE AS IT SETS.

It was incredibly easy to explain to him that this cannot be the case, and then gave him the real explanation. 




 When I dabbled with reptile I just used L1 instead of pressing 1+3. Worked every time. 




 So I was right to say yes? 




 Not the most American thing I've seen, but it's too awesome to not post here. And I'm English.

 Unfortunately the real reason she wears it is probably more sinister i.e. Sexism

Edit: disregard, it was a stupid thing to say.  




 Sub-Zero: Started with Unbreakable (love that ice mask) but soon realised Grand Master is simply a better Unbreakable. So I ues Grand master, because that's the one  perform the best with.

Takeda: Shirai Ryu. Because that's the one  perform the best with.

Jacqui Briggs: Full-auto. Because that's the one  perform the best with.

Goro: Shokan Warrior. Because that's the one  perform the best with.

Tanya: Kobu Justsu. Beca... you get the idea. 




 You said exactly what I was about to say. Thanks for saving me the time. 




 Nope. My atheism is the result of simply not being convinced that a god exists. 




 I feel it applies everywhere, lol. 




 You sound like you know more about this subject than I do, so I'm just going to say yes. 




 I understand there's an audience that loves screaming in videos, but it gives me insta-rage sometimes. It's like "THE LOUDER I BE THE FUNNIER I IS!" 




 My head is crippled. 




 Got to throw those pesky file diggers off the trail somehow! 




 Fallout was never Skyrim with guns, it was Oblivion with guns. At this stage I wouldn't even want Skyrim with guns. Skyrim is my favourite game but man does it fucking look old now.

On newer, more powerful consoles we should get a game built from the ground up, not just some high res PS3 game. 




  I'm going to admit that it could potentially work if done right. But I'd rather have co-op.

I think this is what every Elder Scrolls/Fallout fan wants. 




 Are there planets in the sky in Skyrim? I thought it was just the moons, Masser and Secunda. 




  Eventually, someone made it through.

Master of exposition right here. 




 I said it 3 years ago and I'll say it now. I think TESVI will be in Elsweyr. We've had games set in the land of men and elves, but I don't think we've had one in a beastfolk land. Plus Elsweyr is mentioned in Skyrim in much more detail than any other province.

 Wouldn't be surprised if it was still Jax's voice. 




 Another klassic ninja skin? Awesome. Won't be long before we have the full set... hopefully. I know a lot of people really want a klassic Ermac skin, I hope they get it.

That infrared skin, is it just for Scorpion or is it for eveyone? I think Scorpion's got enough costumes already. 




 Mah ninja. 




 Probably the one where God flooded the Earth, killing very nearly every living thing, and not giving a fuck while doing it.

That's pretty metal.

 What do you guys think about the outrageous price (considering the content on offer) of the next Destiny expansion, The Taken King, and the fact that if you own the game and all current DLC you'll have to completely re-buy the game and the DLC if you want the new emotes they're offering? 









 Ok, thanks. 




 OKC? 




 Pretty impressive paint considering it doesn't smudge onto everything he touches.  




 Does the stats of the parents affect the stats of the child? If so I need to turn Dr. Li into a baby making machine! 




 I didn't mean it like all game have been 60fps before these la two generations, just that they seemed to have more games running 60fps than the recent gens do.  




 Yeah. I've played plenty of games on my PS4 that run at 60fps, like Rogue Legacy and Metal Gear Solid V Ground Zeroes. 60fps is possible on these consoles, but I guess some devs are either too lazy or too inept to make their games run at 60fps **cough Ubisoft cough** 




 I see it now. Thanks for clarifying. Seems to be missing a load of frames of animation for the slap. 




 "Why would you give us brains capable of rational thought, but then punish those of use who exercise that rational thought and come to the conclusion that not only is it unlikely that you exist, but it's logically impossible?" 




 I CAN ask any question. I don't understand yours I'm afraid. 




 You used "to" when you should have used "too". Nice try English impersonator!

Comcast confirmed ;) 




 Nah what ain't? I don't understand what you're disagreeing with me about. It seems we agree that the latest batch of consoles are having difficulty with meeting 60fps, so where's the beef?

Can't believe I managed to fit "where's the beef?" into a sentence and have it be contextually accurate, lol. 




 I don't get it. 




 1. I don't think covering mass shootings actually encourages them. It probably doesn't discourage them though.

2. Was going to comment on your misuse of the word "your", but I see someone beat me to it, and your reply made me smile. So have a few upvotes on me. 




 Consoles have been capable of 60fps for years. It's only the recent generations with their much much much  more complicated graphics and physics engines that are having difficulty. 




 I must be missing something. Does she just salute and then their face explodes? 




 You can get lunchboxes by completing some challenges. The lunchboxes have given me some great loot that I've not come close to finding in the wasteland yet. I haven't bought any lunchboxes yet though. They gave us a few near the beginning to whet our appetites, now they're really few and far between.

 Let's see if this makes it to the front page 2 days running. 




 I started with Unbreakable Sub Zero but someone recommended I switch to GM because of my playstyle. I've never looked back.

Well, I look back from time to time at that awesome ice mask I so dearly miss. 




 Hayfever. 




 I got Dr. Li from a lunchbox as well as a guy called John Rice, both have very high intelligence.

Making a stimpack in 90 seconds? Yes please. 




 I just get sick of all the PC master retards gloating over every little console issue, feels good that the boot is on the other foot.  




 Never played. Pay day game.  









 Klassic ninja FTW. 




 Shit, I'm too lazy to find the thread from 2 days ago when this was posted and leech the top comment.

Damn. 




 Hmm. Might buy.

Next story. 




  I'm gonna fail out of college

Were you even alive when FFVII was released? 




 I never played Kingdom Hearts 1 or 2 seeing as though I was 17 at the time and was more into Metal Gear Solid and Tekken than I was Disney characters.

What makes the games so good? Seems they've got a massive following. 




 This is great news. I was concerned that the long anticipated follow up to the most expensive game ever (at the time) was going to only cost $2million.  




 Hey, it's a rare day when PC gamers suffer while console players have no issues. Let me have this.

I need this... 




 stages in this game arent very hype

What does that even fucking mean? 




 I thought it was a mix of that and saving people from wasting their 3G on videos they never get around to finishing. 




 But... but... the mustard race! 




 I first unlocked the snowball one, but found it difficult to get on unless I was fighting a noob.

I was so relieved when I got the simple "freeze then uppercut" one with no criteria needing to be met like having 40+ seconds left on the clock or other shit like that. 




 Or you could just do what I do. Watch them show up in youtube sub box. That way I get to see all the trailers and announcements, and then reaction videos from people who's opinion I enjoy hearing. 




 I believe your username reveals the answer. 




 I'd imagine organs with some wiggle room, I dunno. 




 Good to know. 




 I know cats can tell you they're angry with their ears, but dogs can tell you they're happy/excited, sad/upset. Cats only really have one emotion anyway, indifferent. 




 It's just a simple way of conveying emotion. It seems like a horse's face can't emote like a human's without looking, weird. We know a lot of animals emote with their ears (dogs primarily). Not sure if horses do in real life. It doesn't seem strange to me that Bojack's ears move, in fact I'd say it seems quite logical. 




 Ever consider some people just want closure on the story? They just left us hanging on a cliff.

Also, each Half Life game that was released pushed the boundaries of what FPS games were capable of, and pretty much set the standard for the genre when they were released. The games might not be what the masses consider to be fun or exciting (although they are), they're technically groundbreaking games. This is why people want Valve to make another one. 



















  but really it's entertainment and to hold it to such serious standards

They hold it to a much more serious standard than I do, lol. Every time I see a hip hip/rap music video (well, 85% of them) I just laugh at how ridiculous I find the whole thing. 




 I never did it back when I was at school, and even if I did that was 15+ years ago, so no, I don't still do that.

Never heard that rhyme before. 




 The whole false bravado thing they have going on.

"Look at me! Look at how rich I am! Look how much weed I smoke! Look how I wield my AK! Look at my car! Look at those shiny wheels! Look at all these hot women I paid to be in my video! Look at my comically over sized clothes! Look at all this jewelry I wear! Look at how much of a big hard gangster I am!"

Then watch them go home and be told by their wife they're not allowed chicken, so they have to send their assistant out to get it on the sly.

I find the whole thing to be a cringe worthy joke, the fact they take it so seriously only adds to the hilarity. I have no interest in listening to something that musically is extremely basic (often to the point of just re-using music someone else made that was already popular), and lyrically is both vapid and a lie.

There are some good hip hop songs, don't get me wrong. I don't think it's all shit, just the stuff I've mentioned here. Which seems to be 85% of it. 




 I remember we sang hymns at primary school during morning assemblies. After a while I realised I simply didn't buy the notion of a god and then stopped singing the hymns. No-one ever called me out on it, might have been different if I'd been in an American school. 




 What's hidden about it? Can't you unlock all the brutalities in the krypt? 




 I never got far in FFVII. I borrowed it from a friend back when it came out but never got off the first disc, I've had it on my PS3 for about 3 years now and haven't managed to play past the first 6 hours or so. I'm sure the game is good, but I can never seem to get into it. Final Fantasy VIII was my FF when I was younger (followed by X of course).

Hopefully this remake will keep me entertained enough to want to go back to the original one day and complete it. 









 Well that clears that up then. Thanks.  




 Uh... "A" to jump? 




 I didn't know 3 had MP. Was that in the subsistence version? I never played that version until I got the HD collection on PS3, and I never noticed MP in that version, although I wasn't looking for it.  




 we wanted to show people we could do it, and how little we care about it. 




 I wish the video wasn't limited to 144p. I must see this creature in higher quality so I can attempt to identify it. 




 "Shhhh. Just let it happen." 




 Ive never liked the horse shit mechanic. It just looks so fake compared to the general graphics in the game, at least to me.  




 What makes you think life has a meaning or a purpose? We exist, that's about all we can say.

Something I like thinking about is what is the one thing ALL life does, or tries to do?

Procreate/Attempt to perpetuate the survival of it's species.

By this logic you could argue that anyone who has a kid that reaches adulthood has technically won at life, kinda. 




 "That's be great."

Great grammar. Also making childish demands like this makes you seem like an asshole. 




 I don't care. My reddit usage hasn't changed one iota. Storm in a teacup. 




 It's fine. I don't feel like I'm in danger when using reddit. It's just a typical kneejerk reaction to people's freedoms supposedly being oppressed.

It seems a lot of people seem to think that reddit is somehow affected by the US government's constituion regarding free speech. Reddit owns reddit, they can silence whatever they want. I almost cannot believe how much of a big issue is being made over this, and the childish reaction from many redditors just makes me happy that a lot of them claim to be ready to leave reddit. We'll be better off without them.

Also people like to use the slippery slope argument. Whatever. What's the worst thing reddit could to us? Shut down the site I guess, that would be the ultimate form of "suppression of free speech", even though they're stopping people from saying what they want elsewhere.

I guess it depends on what you mean by safe. 




 On more than one occasion in the last year I've seen a guy, looks to be in his early 20's, riding an electric unicycle while I'm on my way home from work. It looked like this one but was dark grey instead of high viz yellow. Was weird as hell to watch. But so cool. 




 And I remember Tekken 3 being 45 at release. I guess different games have different prices. 




 I played the shit out of Metal Gear Solid 4. I tried the multiplayer once and hated it beyond words, to the point where I groaned with disappointment when they announced multiplayer in MGSV.  




 True. But it seems every day someone in America posts a random dog/cat they just found wandering around outside. 




 Good response, thanks. 




 Some were, most were 40. Maybe games were cheaper where you live for some reason. 




 My mistake. Should have read it properly. Thanks for the clarification. 




 Huuuge bucket of win. 




 Not just the 90's. He recently released [this single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TnFIDKyX50) just a couple of years ago. 




 Does America have a serious problem of just cats and dogs all over the place looking for homes? Seems every day someone makes a post to reddit about how some random homeless animal turned up and now it's theirs. How are animal shelters still running with so many free pets everywhere? 




 I hope you're doing something about that morbidly obese pet. 




  30 used to be the norm

When? I remember Street Fighter II Turbo and Sonic Spinball being 55 back in 1993. That equates to roughly 101 in today's money. Sure most games weren't 55 back then, but some were. I remember the average price of a Mega Drive game being around 40, going up 10 - 15 in 20 years isn't so bad really. Games may technically be more expensive now but considering how little the price has risen since the 16 bit era compared to how much content games now have they've never been better value for money than they are right now. 




 FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK you Konami. 




 So it's true, Konami ARE trying to burn the MGS franchise to the ground like that guy once said. 




 *if it gets out of control. 




 Claws, not toenails. 




 Upon further thunking I suppose the Indian guy represents that part of Asia (Pakistan, India etc). The American Asian guy represents the other part of Asia (Japan, China etc), while the French guy represents Europe.

Maybe. 




 I still don't buy the trailer just happening to reconnect on it's own. I don't believe it. 




 So there's two Americans, a different kind of American, a Frenchie, and an Indian guy.

This represents the whole world according to the director. 




 It is cool, as it was yesterday. 




 The guy said all he used was a "handling mod". Looks like this mod includes super turbo and auto "suck trailer back to the hook up point of the truck" features. 




 She didn't make /r/ALL FPH, childish morons who have kneejerk reactions to shit did that for her. 




 [How I feel about this whole thing.](http://tasteuni-co-uk.optimizewpcom.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/14309-go-to-the-winchester-have-a-nice-cold-pint-and-wait-for-all-of-this-to.jpg) 




  But they never actively harassed someone out of the subreddit

Irrelevant whether it's in or out of the subreddit surely. What's SRS anyway? I keep hearing people say it but don't know what it is, sounds really shitty though.

they only hate those who are fat and deny it, or ignore it.

Well, that makes their harassment ok then. /s 




 If it's a shithole you think should burn why are you still here? 









 Those new replacement subreddits are obviously created with the sole intention of replacing the old ones and continuing to harass people, that's why they're getting banned. 




 I just woke up and logged on, let me know if I've got this right.

The story is cunts told to shut up, people get upset? 









 Perhaps.  




 I just checked out one of the other angles. I'd really love to know how how got that speed in that truck given the relatively short road leading up to the jump. Experimenting later. 




 To make it seem more impressive.

But yeah, since he said that I guess I'm inclined to believe him. I'm curious to know how this custom handling mod affects trailers. I'm going to record and post my own attempts at this jump on PS4 and see if the truck really can fly that much from that jump. 




 "Kombat me, FOOL!" 




 The free aim shooting in fallout 3 and new vegas are pure shit. I'd say 99.9% of my kills with guns in those games was using vats, the control really was that bad. At least on console. 




 Vats is what makes Fallout stand out. Fallout is an RPG and those numbers have to count somewhere, with vats you can see the numbers in action. 




 Two reasons I don't use horses in Skyrim.

#1. I have a follower.
#2. They're shit. 




 Not in a truck like that, pulling a trailer. 




 There's no truck in the game that would fly like that off that jump without moon gravity, especially pulling a trailer.

I might have to check later on just to make sure. 




 You got an apostrophe right and then neglected to use one in "reddits".

0/10 unsubscribed would recommend to a friend. 




 Indeed. I do enjoy his dialogue though. Not sure why. I just like the words he uses. 




 FYI. They're called couch gags. 




 It's too awesome to believe. Obviously moon gravity is on. Seems too good to be true without mods though. 




 [Literally every man in this thread](http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/dgbg.gif) 




  There is nothing wrong with telling someone this in hopes that they will make a plan and succeed. 

I agree. But saying it in a dickish manner as he did was unnecessary. It seemed like he was bringing anger from people in r/fitness to people who did nothing to warrant the attitude. 




 Raiden's character is like this.

Tries to protect Earthrealm. Is pretty much useless at his job. 




 This is the kind of attitude I've come to expect from regular gym goers, and one of the reasons I don't go. 




 This concerns me about going to the gym. I need to start going to work off the flab I've built up in the 4 years I've had this office job, but I've never been to a gym before. I don't want to end up on youtube as one of those noobs who's using a machine wrong or something like that. Plus I keep hearing tales of assholes at gyms.

Maybe I'll just take up jogging instead. 




 "Homeboy!"

Classic line. Also, is it just my player or is the video really fucking stretched horizontally? They all look like super midgets. 




 It was delicious.  




 When he fights Jason he simply says: 

"Kombat me, fool!"

So fucking cool.  




 It happens in the natural world, who are we tip the balance in the bee's favour? 




 It just looks medieval to me. If the Elder Scrolls hadn't been mentioned in the title the thought would never have crossed my mind. 



















 I don't recall saying I don't find it compelling.  I'm looking forward to seeing it. I liked Silent Running, and this seems like it's got a similar theme.

I was just wondering what I was missing, it seemed everyone was super mega excited about it and I didn't know why. Now I now why. It was a popular book and people love Ridley Scott.  




 I wasn't looking at my phone. I shut the video off because it was time to leave work and go home. 




 "I remember now! Today is the day I met you!" 




 SPAAYCE! 




 I don't recall saying anything about interacting with them, but how do you know aliens wouldn't interact with us? We don't know their motives. Sure it's more likely that they'd observe us before doing anything, that's just common sense.

 Once they realized we're all poo-flinging hate monkeys, they'd likely pass us by.

I bet if we're the first planet they've seen with life on it (besides their own) they'd be pretty interested in us. 




 If they found us I reckon they'd observe us for a while, no idea what they'd do after that. They might just leave once they see how primitive we are compared to them. If this is the first planet they've seen with life on it (besides their own) they'd probably either want to interact with us, or they might do the whole "Don't interfere with nature" thing.

My thing is if they've got the tech to get here they'd surely have the tech to remain hidden from us, and they certainly wouldn't come all the way here to just crash like some people think, they'd be pretty inept aliens if they did that.

Sure there's some unexplained sightings, but they're just that, unexplained. Most sightings have been explained as being something like a plane, weather balloon (cliche I know) or just strange lighting. I think the time to believe aliens have visited us is when there's good evidence to support it, not anecdotal heresay and footage which can be easily manipulated digitally. 




 I'll agree with you that maybe the skater should have taken more care. Still a total over reaction by the mother though. She was acting like she was certain he ran into the kid on purpose. 




 For some reason I don't buy Matt Damon as an astronaut from these two trailers, maybe it was the line "I'm gonna have to science the shit out of this." That line just sounds fucking dumb to me. He just seems like the wildly unscientific scientists in Prometheus  




 I know man. It was "coming soon" for what felt like months. then it arrived and was immediately removed because it somehow still wasn't ready.

I'm beginning to think this game is being supported by monkeys. I haven't played for over a week. I refuse to play until Raiden turns up. Even then, the combat is just pretty boring compared to Injustice. I don't know if I'll eve get back into this game. Very disappoint with it from day 1 to now. 




 That's what I believe, yes. I've not seen anything that's convinced me otherwise. 




 People don't just start to say things like that.

Yes they do. People see things in the sky that they can't identify, some people think it's alien ships, I think they're mistaken.

There's so many things these people could have seen, at the end of the day they saw a UFO, the U meaning unidentified, meaning they don't know what it is, jumping to conclusions that it's aliens is silly.

I don't believe anyone has seen aliens visit Earth. I believe aliens exist, but not that they've been here. Based on the fact that we KNOW people lie, and we KNOW people are prone to being mistaken, and we KNOW our senses are easily fooled, and we haven't seen any verifiable evidence of aliens being here, I don't believe people who claim to have seen alien space ships have actually seen alien space ships. 




 I don't think I've ever been not ok with my own mortality. I don't want to die but I know it's going to happen, I just have to try to stave it off for a long as I can.

Where was I before I was born? That's where I'll be when I'm dead. 




 Depends on the girl I guess. Suspicion would probably be my first thought. 




 But what if you flew over somewhere you'd never been before and saw a creature you'd never seen before? Would you check them out or just go "huh" and keep flying? 




 True. But conversely you can have a bad film that has entertaining aspects such as the action. 




  Even if 50% of those are made up

What makes you think any of them aren't made up? 




 I believe aliens exist because it's pretty much a mathematical impossibility that this planet is the only one that has life on it.

I don't believe aliens have visited Earth. 




 And that's when it's time to play Bodies in your head and drop a bitch. It was an honest accident. The kid and skater collided, didn't look like anyone was in error either way, mother over reacts, punches a guy because women are untouchable right? Deserves a punch back IMO. 




 Triggered! 




 I suspect he may be misusing the word "mate". 




 I'm interested to hear what the woman of reddit has to say on the matter. I bet she's got some interesting opinions. 




 If I were going out with a girl and she later revealed she used to be a man I'd be pretty pissed off. That's the kind of shit that should be made clear beforehand. 




 Huh. And here I thought paths like that were laid by hand. This makes much more sense. 




 I saw Prometheus. His name doesn't carry a film for me any more.  




 Then I literally didn't see that part. 




 I'm not saying there's anything wrong with films made from books, not sure where you're getting the notion that I have a problem with that. It explains the hype I'm seeing. Before today I didn't know it was originally a popular book, knowing this pretty much answers the question posted in the title. 




  People feel as if too much attention was given to the human characters instead of the Transformers themselves.

Well I agree with you there. But I feel the films can still be enjoyable. 




 True Megan Fox didn't help IMO. But the explosions and changes never bothered me. 




 Nature in general is scary, the insect world is just fucked up. 




 It's not annoying me, it just looks kind of bland and pretty similar to Silent Runnings. Now I know it was a popular book beforehand (what isn't these days?) I can understand why people are excited about it. 




 I didn't say I didn't want to see it, I was just curious as to why it was making huge waves when there seems to be nothing new or unique about it at all, looks pretty similar to Silent Runnings to be honest. The fact that it was a popular book before this is news to me and goes a long way to explain the hype. 




 Yeah I didn't know it was a loved book already. I should have guessed though, everything seems to be adapted from a book these days. Thanks for the clarification. 




 Of course, what film isn't based on a book these days? I guess the book was popular even though I've never heard of it. Then again, I nevereven heard of Harry Potter until the first film was made. 




 I like the Transformer films, you know why? Because I like the Transformers, and I sometimes like to watch mindless action. People shit all over Bay's films because he likes to blow shit up, sometimes I want to see shit get blown up. There's always room for Whiplash, Birdman, The Theory of Everything. But there's also room for Transformers. Obviously the human elements of those films always suck balls and should be dropped from all future Transformer films, but I for one love watching giant robots beat the shit out of each other, and frankly I'm amazed that seemingly no-one else does.

How odd.

Transformers 2 is the obvious exception, that film can go die somewhere. 




 Can someone explain to me why this film is generating to much hype? It seems pretty cheesy to me. With cringeworthy lines like "Every human has the same instinct, the instinct to help each other out." and "I'm gonna have to science the shit out of this." I can't quite believe how much of a big deal people seem to be making of it, I must be missing some vital information.

Edit: The title is meant to read "...so much hype." not "...to much hype."

 I clicked the link, but before I could start reading the article a really obnoxious unmutable ad filled the screen.

Left that site without reading anything. 




 I like the way the blonde guy is like "Fuck this shit, I've seen this happen before." 




 [Here he is on the red carpet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMgXboVyxY0) 




 But it's coming. It's always coming.  




 Cars do have lights. But that doesn't mean people wearing black glow like lightbulbs when a cars lights are on them. If your main beams are on then yeah, they'll show up easier. But you'd be surprised how late you can see someone when they're walking in the dark and dress dark, on the road, with no reflective articles whatsoever. It's asking to be killed.  




 "Every human being has the same instinct. To help each other out."

Yeah, apart from all the ones who don't have that instinct. I hope this opening line isn't indicative of the message this film is going to try to portray. 




 I know. I have a fear of bees and I actually squirmed a couple of times watching this.

But I was facing my fear! So I'm a man!      ...right? 




 I approve of your username, even if you are kind of hard to find. 




 I guess you were lucky in so much as you had a great deal of empathy. Perhaps you were treated badly and thought "This is shitty, I'd never do this to another person." Some people just go "Oh, this is normal behaviour. I've got no problem being an asshole to other people." 




 I'm sorry to hear that but glad that he's doing well given the situation. 














 Back when I was playing this games I used Deathstroke, Doomsday, and Wonder Woman as my silver team. Pretty beast. 




 Your crazy cat lady is showing. 




 More like replacing the Puffin. This is just another meme where people are going to voice their disliking of certain things or types of people. 









 Maybe not blasted over and over and over, but kids to usually have to be taught right from wrong, that being mean to other people is wrong, and being nice to other people is, well... nice. 




 I wouldn't believe anything written on a website called psychic101.com lmao. In order for me to answer your question I'd have to think such a place exists in the first place, why do you believe it exists? 




 [Relevant](http://media.balls.ie/uploads/2014/01/Rocky.jpg) 




 Some people don't. I almost never skip them. It's always cool when you meet someone else who wants to see it as well. 




 define astral plane please. 




 I don't watch these videos that give away the dialogue. I'd much rather wait until the character's released and see them in person while playing ranked matches. 




 Wow, you'll have to be more specific than "those skinny models". Some pictures/examples would be helpful.

I don't like skeletons and I don't like huge fat women. Does that answer your question? 




 Don't look for logic in racism. 




 I was told I had to preorder GTAV to get access to the blimp. I preordered it 8 months before release to make sure I'd get a copy (this was back when I thought games could still sell out). I was standing in line with my Xbox 360 preorder but changed my mind to PS3 when my friend finally told me he was going to get it. So I picked up a PS3 copy, minus a pre-order, and I still go the blimp.

This was when I realised pre-ordering games was literally a waste of time. 




 I think it's more the fact that he made a pretty racist remark, but is still employed.

Could you imagine if a white professor had called predominantly black colleges "Black Chocolate Bumfuckery Township" and he kept his job? 




 Magic, next question. 




 Not worth it then IMO. 




 Record it on my phone and observe it. 




 "Its about how ridiculousness in love I am with you."

WAT? 
























 It was on my first try. I closed the app and reopended it, was able to skip the intro. 




 Yeah. 70,000 koins for 3 gear cards? Fuck that rip off, I'll just collect the rewards at the end of a season. And no option to buy Revenant Sub-Zero or Revenant Jax without buying the 850 souls pack? There's a decent amount of kontent in this update to be sure (althought the challenges they speak of aren't here) but wow, making everything so expensive is a real good way to... ah whatever. Everything's been mega expensive in this game since launch anyway so whatever.

Anyone else notice they didn't mention the fact that the gold kombat pack is now more expensive as well? It's back up to the original 150 souls. Gotta squeeze that money out of us somehow I guess. 














 I suppose, lol. It just blows my mind when I hear some music on the radio and I say "Wow, this person/group has a record deal. I mean, someone paid them real money to make this and release it." 









 I've never suffered trauma and I don't have PTSD or high anxiety or anything like that. Therefore I have no opinion on the matter. 




 I never said all modern music is shit, just MOST of the shit in the charts. Boring repetitive lyrics and uninspired melodies rule the day. There's plenty of modern music I like, but most of the popular stuff really doesn't appeal to me. 




 Didn't CJ betray OG Loc though? Helped him get Madd Dogg's rhyme book but later chased him down and extorted a shit tonne of money out of him for releasing a song using Madd Dogg's rhymes?

You better check yourself before you wreck re-wreck yourself. 




 The first part is wrong, the second part is pretty much right, minus the stupid part. I wouldn't call someone stupid for their preferences, but if I think they enjoy shit then I'm gonna say it.

But then again, at the risk of sounding like a massive douche hipster, I find lot of mainstream stuff to be shit, music especially. [Am I so out of touch?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYAuR5bkIlQ)
 




 Shhhh! Spoilers!

Seriously though, regardless of what Smoke did, every time I see him in cut scenes it's like seeing an old buddy of mine, since I've spent way more time in his company early in the game than I have near the end of the game when, well, you know. 




 1. Maybe you don't want to spend all day running across the desert and a vehicle is too noisy.

2. Maybe you don't want to use the somewhat OP buddies.

3. Maybe you want to experience all the game has to offer.

4. Maybe you want to see if the hilariously unrealistic looking horse shit has been made to look less cartoony since we saw it last year. 




 Good isn't subjective though. Quality of a product is objective. Too few people realise that something you like and something that's good aren't always the same thing.

Example time.

I don't like Coldplay's music, but I recognise that they are in fact a good band.

I like one or two of Dizzy Rascal's songs, but I don't think his music is technically good.

See?

if a few million people think it's good, that probably makes it good

Nope, that's the appeal to popularity fallacy. The amount of people who like something has no bearing on the actual quality of the product in question. Millions of people (myself included) love McDonald's food, that doesn't mean the food is good, far from it, the food is bad, but we still like it.

Conversely, millions of people HATE iPhones, that doesn't mean iPhones are bad, on the contrary, iPhones are pretty fucking good compared to most phones on the market.

So you see, quality isn't subjective, but how people feel about a product is.  




 I would have done it myself lol. 




 Yeah. People en masse love to eat up shit in large quantities. Look at crap like X Factor and The Apprentice. The number of people who like something has no bearing on the quality of said product. If you think the only factor of success is quality of the product then you're mistaken. The right marketing can sell shit just fine.

I think I've gone too far now. I don't think Kanye's music is all shit, that would be unfair to say. I can definitely say his music isn't for me, and I can definitely say that I prefer most of my music to his, but then I'm slightly biased so that doesn't mean much.

But I can say with certainty that I believe his music (and his shitty attitude) don't justify his success. 




 Straight busta. And get yo' self a haircut. Embarrassing to be seen witch you. 




 I know they can notice, but they never seem to in the videos I've seen. The whole thing just looks absurd to me. I know MGS has always had zany moments but they were usually few and far between. This game seems to flip flop between being realistic and a cartoon every 5 minutes.

Don't even get me started on that fucking flying fist bullshit. No amount of saying "nanomachines" is going to get me to accept the absurdity of that.

Looks fun though. 




  I mean seriously how hard of a question could I have asked at 7 or 8. I don't even remember the questions I asked

I think the point is you asked questions at all. That's the trouble with religion, it all too often discourages questioning because when you start to question religion the whole thing hilariously falls apart. 









 Lol. You think the quality of someone's music has much to do with getting platinum. Most labels don't give a shit if the music is good, they care if the musician is marketable. The two are not entirely related.  




 I don't mean right behind the train. I could have been more clear. What most people do (myself included in the past) was ride beside the person we wanted smoke to shoot. What should be done is ride behind the enemy so they're on screen but close enough to shoot. Always worked for me.  




 Oh, that's what that annoying sound was? 




 I'm sure it is the user spurring the horse. But if you want to get somewhere quickly you'll be spurring like mad, as they guy in the video did.  




 Thanks to social media and apathy it's a losing battle. I keep going in and out of trying to correct people, but in the end usage is the arbiter final when it comes to language. If enough people are wrong enough for long enough they eventually become right. Just look at how the word literally is used by the youth these days.  I'm sure Shakespeare would tell me I'm doing English wrong, lol.  




 I've made some music on my phone that I believe to be better than some of the shit I've heard from Kanye. Admittedly I didn't talk over my music so I guess he got me beaten lyrically, even if loads of his lyrics are just shite. 

He's a rap star. You speak as though rock stars don't exist any more. 




 Ah I see. No I didn't see it. I stopped acting destiny the minute I realised it was not so much a game, but a money making platform.  




 No. If you unexpectedly find yourself out of the house you just put the watch into power reserve mode.  




 And now that's the way I'll do it if I ever play it again.  




 I find it jarring and it pulls me out of it. At least it did in peace walker.  




 Yeah I know it's a real thing. But it's presented weirdly here. The way they hover then zip up quickly, the way no-one seems to notice it. It just pulls me out of the relative reality of the game. 

Edit: Again, downvoted for voicing my opinion in a polite manner and not insulting anyone in any way. Well done reddit. 




 I just make sure I'm far enough behind the enemy I want him to shoot so the enemy is on screen and I've not had any trouble with this method.  




 So just because a smart watch uses electricity or cannot be considered good engineering or art? Is argue the apple watch is much more appealing to the eye than many dumb watches of the same price I've seen.

I get that some purple like old ways of doing things. But I'm not one of them, if there's a more modern (and usually better) way of doing something (like tell the time) I'm all up for it.  




 I got a stand from a third party. The cable discreetly fits into the stand and the actual charging disc is presented in such a way that I can just place my watch onto it and it'll charge while remaining the right way up. Imagine the way watches are displayed in shop windows, it looks like that when charging. The charge easily lasts a day, even with heavy use, I'd still charge every night though as it'll run out half way through the following day of you don't. Or just have another charger at work, but it's better to charge at night so you can actually use it during the day.  




 I'm glad I'm not alone with my line of thinking. Imagine riding a horse for 5 minutes in that game.

*mute* 




 I can make a beat on my phone, doesn't make me a rock god.  




 Yeah, I'm sure he's deliberately pretending to be an arrogant annoying cunt most people can't stand.  




 He's a rapper. He talks over a beat for a living. And he thinks he's gods gift to music.  




 Don't take the words of a delusional man too seriously.  




 Because he's an arsehole.  




 But hardly any of them do it as loudly and with as much self assurance as he does. Most do it for show, rap is 90% appearance anyway. Kanye genuinely believes he's god's gift to music, and thinks everyone needs to know.  




 Kanye is a big headed prick that needs a serious reality check. That's why people hate him.

He literally thinks he's god's gift to music, if not humanity. His music is largely shitty. His attitude is shitty. He is a shitty.  




 That's good then. I guess it's good that they're showing us all the different things you an do in the that you may not even think about if you were just playing it.  




 At least in red dead there was a variety of sounds john made while on a horse. It wasn't just the same "Hyah!" Every 2 seconds. I got sick of it in this video, if it stays like that in the finished game I'll probably avoid horses.  




 That's good to know, thanks.  




 That's all good then.  




 The Fulton system seems out of place to me. I know it's been in since peace walker but still, it just seems too comical given the circumstances it's usually used in. I find it a little jarring, which is a shame because it looks like it's used a lot in this game.  




 Seems awful that when you're riding a horse you have to listen to the same "Hyah!" Sound bite over and over and over again. I hope they fix that before release.  




 I've been avoiding all these 30 minute gameplay demos because I don't want the entire game to be spoiled for me. But I'm gonna cave and watch this one. Surely most of the game has been shown in demos at this point? So many trailers it seems.  




 Am I the only one who thought the Iron Giant was a so-so film? Everyone seems to hail it as some timeless classic. What did I miss? 




 I've only played with him for about an hour so far but yeah, if you win a match and you're far enough away from the opponent as to avoid the walking away while scanning the blade animation he seems to imitate his opponent's laugh. I've only heard him laugh though. 




 I'm not telling you what to do. I'm not telling Citadel_CRA what to do either. I'm just letting him know I disapprove of people trying to make funner a word. Which I'm allowed to do. If you disagree, that's cool, I won't hold it against you or anything.

It's all opinions man, isn't that what reddit comments are all about? 









 I used to have trouble too. Once I realised he can only his enemies when they're on screen the mission became infinitely easier. 




 Downvoted for using "funner" like it's a word. 




 I used to feel the same until I realised I was the one in the wrong. I used to pull up along side the train because that would make sense. The trick is he can only hit enemies that are on the screen. Once you know this fact the mission becomes insanely easy. I always have the Vagos killed before the train enters the tunnel these days.

Edit: Downvoted for letting people know how to do the famously hard mission easily? What the fuck? 




 Wow. It's like playing the PS3 version again. 




 Wat? 




 Well, if the only reason you buy a watch is so you can sell it later for a good price then I guess you won't want a smart watch. I don't have a watch because it will hold it's value, I have a watch because it does cool things. 




 You only need to buy a smart watch every few years if you want to keep using all the nifty extra features that a smart watch can do (which you'll obviously want to do, but is by no means necessary).

If you don't buy a new watch after 3 or 4 years and it stops being able to do the fancy stuff you're still left with a nice looking watch that tells the time, same as if you bought a dumb watch, only you got 3-4 years of smartness out of it. 




 I woulnd't pay the money for one, mine was a 30th birthday present. It's just cool. I love the way the screen is blank until you raise your arm to check the time, then it lights up. Also being able to create and send text messages/hold phone conversations using your watch is futuristic as fuck. Joe 90/Jetsons futuristic.

Plus I've still not seen anyone else wearing one, so I guess the exclusivity is nice, if you're into that sort of thing.

The watch is also basically a remote for your phone. If there's any video or audio playing you can play, pause, or skip tacks using the watch.

When I'm walking down the shops I can put my headphones in and just say to my watch "Hey Siri, play Muse" and it'll do just that. Or just saying "Play random music" is pretty cool too.

If I'm playing games and I get a text I might miss it because I use a gaming headset, but with the watch I don't miss texts because I get a subtle tap on the wrist telling me I have a notification. I can then glance at my watch and read the message without having to pick up my phone, unlock it, then read.

If you're in a quiet place the voice recodnition software is flawless, easily the best I've ever used. Outside in the city, well, you might as well text on your phone.

Overall I wouldn't say they're quite worth the asking price, yet. More apps are being developed daily, but like I said, mine was a birthday present and I love it. One word to describe the Apple Watch, cool. 




 This is the first time I've seen one in the wild since I saw that video telling me that such a thing existed. Upvoted for use of interrobang.

Side note: Chrome doesn't recognise the word interrobang, lol. 




 I just take my watch off every night anyway, so nightly charging isn't an issue for me at all. 




  You need to re-buy smart watches every few years

Source? 




 I hate it when I check the time and someone says "I'm sorry, are we keeping you?"

I'm like: Uh, no. I just wanted to see what the fucking time was you tedious prick. 




 Do you take your watch off at night when you go to bed? That's when you charge it. 




  garmin vivofit

Those are some nifty features. Shame it's ugly as hell. 




 Then they won't be buying one, just as they won't be buying a $350 dumb watch. 




 Do you take your watch off when you go to bed at night? I did with my dumb watch, as I now do with my smart watch. The only difference being that now, the stand I put my watch on charges the watch while I sleep. This whole having to charge your watch complaint is entirely redundant unless you NEVER take your watch off. 




 No-one needs an expensive anything, but some people want them. 




  What's gonna happen when my watch doesn't get updated for gmail, gps, and any other useful function?

Then you got 2 good years of fancy watch uses, now you can go back to your phone and you're still left with a cool watch that tells the time. You could probably still make calls and send texts using it too. 




  They look at things like the history, the craftsmanship, the details of the finish, the innovations, the complications, and of course, the brand itself.

Can all these things not be appreciated with smart watches? Ok, maybe the history can't, yet, but I couldn't care less about the history of the company that made my watch, that doesn't affect my usage of said watch. 




 I don't get it. People seem fine with paying $400+ for a watch that does nothing but tell the time, yet turn their noses up at a $400+ watch that tells the time, contains a calendar, can tell you the weather, can play games, can access social media, is basically a remote control for any audio/video playing on your phone, is supported with OS updates, manage emails, has maps and can direct you to a destination via subtle taps on the wrist signalling when to turn left or right, can access photos on your phone, can show you the stock exchange, and CAN MAKE CALLS AND TEXTS LIKE THE FUCKING JETSONS!

It also looks cool as hell IMO. 




 Or, you could buy a smart watch, use all the fancy features a dumb watch doesn't have for at least a couple of years, then if your watch is outdated by a new OS (unlikely since you can update a watches OS too) then you're still left with a watch that tells the time, just as you would a dumb watch.

As for a "horrible" battery life. I always took my old watch off every night and put it on my bed side table, I do the same with my smart watch, only now it rests on a charging stand. The battery life is not an issue. 




  It makes no sense

Welcome to the world of religion! 




 I'm surprised some people never noticed the giant ship that makes noises when he does a brutality. I love the way he laughs as he walk away, so badass. 




 I really wish they'd given him some lines at the beginning of fights. I'm really disappointed that the DLC characters all have only one costume each, and their dialogue is seriously lacking. I know Jason can't talk so he gets a pass. Tanya's dialogue usually boils down to:

Tanya: [Enemy's name.]
Enemy: Tanya!
Tanya: [a line that just someone's name] 




 This is just ramping off a mound of sand/rocks. If you watch the video you'll be able to see where it is. It's near the prison.

http://youtu.be/gfsKirun0ss 




 I'm capable of understanding that people like it. I'm just saying that I don't.  




 Totally worth it if you like MGS.  









 Yes, they're the special editions you mentioned. MGS3 even has Metal Gear 1 and 2 included, so it's really 5 games in one! 




 Ah, now you've given me that sage advice my mind is at rest.  




 It's near the satellite dishes in Sandy Shores. Me and some friends had fun trying to land our cars in the dishes.  




 That's different. French Fries may not be French, but their name is indeed French fries.

A barrel roll is not an aileron roll. To say it is is to be wrong.  




 Then you'll be wrong every time you call something that's not a barrel roll a barrel roll.  




 And I agree. 




 WAAAAAA!!!!! 




 I don't want to buy a shitty hand held system just to play one game though. And as I've mentioned in many other comments I did get the HD collection, and was thoroughly disappointed with how crap Peace Walker was.  




 I can over it, for the most part. It doesn't bug me too much when playing Ground Zeroes, but I'll never forget/forgive kojima for fucking up so royally.  




 Me too, until they released the HD bundle on PS3 a year later that included MGS2, MGS3, and MGS Peace Walker, all in HD.  




 Nearly interchangeable, but not quite. If one pilot said to another "Do a barrel roll", but he did an aileron roll, there could be dire consequences. 




 It's not a bad style per se, but when you compare it to the cutscenes from any previous MGS game they're an embarrassment. I didn't know a storyboard was going to tell the story before I bought the game. When they started I was like "I really fucking hope this is just the intro and the whole game's story isn't told this way."

And so I was disappointed from the get go.  




 Yeah, it's all my opinion. I'm not tying to say that these things are objectively better in previous games, just how I feel about them.

And you mentioning technical limitations takes us back to my initial point. If the game has to be crippled mechanically because it's being released on a hand held then maybe just make it a console game and fully realise the glorious vision, and save the hand held for some non canonical game like MGS Acid.  




 But the border detailed in the diagram kind of sort of almost looks like a barrel shape, nearly.  




 Keifer did do a good job, even though in Ground Zeros he constantly sounds like he's in a recording booth, sound design dropped the ball on that one IMO. Sounds like he's in a small box every time he speaks. 

My point is they could have replaced Hayter with anyone and it would have been worse, because Hayter's voice is Snake's. It's like if Dan Castellaneta was dropped from the Simpsons cast and was replaced by someone who did a voice that sounded nothing like Homer's. Change an iconic voice and I lose all connection to the character that had been built up over the years. 




 MGS1 is the only one where I felt the character moved sluggishly. After playing the first 3 Resident Evils and the first 3 Tomb Raiders the movement in MGS2 and 3 was anything but tank like. I never felt like the characters were uncooperative in their movements in MGS2 and 3.  




 I know making a MGS game on a hand held was inevitable, they already did it with Acid. My gripe comes from the fact that it was canon. I felt like I was missing out on the latest chapter in my favourite game story, because that's what WAS happening.

Sure they released it later on consoles but it was still a shitty mobile game, one that I didn't bother finishing because it was such a step back from the previous games. They could have made Acid 2 and 3 for all I care, I wouldn't have been missing out on a brand new fully featured sequel to (at the time) my second favourite game.  




 Yeah I bought that, I got to play Peace Walker... eventually. Was disappointed greatly by it.  




 Here's a list of things PW did worse than previous games, in my opinion.

Graphics

Cutscenes

Story

Characters

Shooting Mechanics (ok, they were better than in MGS 2, I'll admit that)

Incredibly tedious base building

Story separated into individual missions like an arcade game

Lack of any cinematic feel

Weird boss fights set in obviously-only-existing-to-support-a-boss-fight arenas

I'm sure there's more, but it's been 3 years since I played PW and I don't remember it all that well. I don't think there's any aspect of PW that improved over previous entries.  




 What would you call the move if done in, say, a car? It's still not a barrel roll.  














 True. But I think this is one of those instances of "When enough people are wrong enough for long enough, they become right." That seems to be how language evolves.

Like when most people say laminating they actually referring to encapsualting. 




 What was an accident? 




 This STILL happens? Wow. 




 I still think it's dumb to cut out a huge portion of your fanbase (i.e. everyone who didn't own a PSP) of the franchise. I wouldn't care if it weren't canon like MG Acid. But to make a canonically accurate direct sequel only available to a tiny portion of the people who love the series, and also make it easily worse than the two previous installments just bugged me for years. 




 True. But then again I don't even really consider this to be the Snake I know and love since they dropped David Hayter. Dave IS Snake. 




  keep in mind that it's meant to be a psp game so there are a lot of stuff that might seem shitty compared to older games like mgs2 or 3

This really bugged me.

Konami: Let's make a direct sequel to the best MGS game to date. And let's make it canon! And let's gimp it by making it a handheld title so it's worse than the previous 2 games in every respect.

Second biggest disappointment in gaming for me. 




 I got Peace Walker with the HD collection on PS3 and was hugely disappointed, worst MGS game I've played.

The way the story was presented was a joke. No actual cutscenes (something the series is famous for) and instead they gave us shitty scratchy line scribbles, thanks Kojima. That totally ruined the whole experience for me. Then the gameplay was pretty shitty too. Coming off the back of the amazing MGS3 I was so happy to finally, after years of thinking I'd never get to play it, play PW. And wow was it a step backwards. You can say "But it was a PSP game so you can't expect much." or something like that, and to that I say they shouldn't have made a PSP MGS then, if it's going to literally be a step back in the series in every respect.

Did not finish, read the story on the wiki, probably won't go back to it, bad MGS game IMO. 




 I missed him the second I started playing Ground Zeroes.

Snake is dead, this is as bad as when they changed the actor who played John Connor from T2 to T3. Can't connect with the character, or rather I should say the connection has been severed. 




 Wasn't he trying to escape the "honour" of the title Big Boss because of his mission in MGS3? I figured he went back to being called Snake because it was his "name" before he **[MGS3 SPOILERS]** killed The Boss. 




  It seems like a lot of the ideas they're expanding in MGSV were ones that started off in peace walker.

Probably because MGSV is a sequel to MGS Peace Walker. 









 Got any links to share? 




 I know very little of the situation. For obvious reasons they're not discussing the details of the firing.

From what I can piece together from the backs of packets of mustard it seems people are more upset about the way the firing was handled (or not handled), rather than the firing itself. They have no notice to other mods or something. I think this is just the latest in a long list of reasons people have to hate Ellen, someone is not heard of until the previous debacle happened.

Luckily I'm currently down the Winchester having a nice pint waiting for this to all blow over.   




 Glad I could help.  




 I know you don't want to, but trust me, it's for your own good.  




 I don't read the comics, so I thought you were on about the actual blood code lmao.  




 I never said you couldn't ask for him in this game. You said you wanted some Spawn action, I told you where you can find it. I wasn't diminishing your request or coming at you with any attitude. Chill out and perhaps don't read attitude into comments that contain none, you'll be happier that way.  




 Noob Saibot is all I want.

But if I have to choose, I'd say:

Noob Saibot.
 




 Go play the Xbox version of Soul Calibur 2, he's in that. 




 Those are great ideas, sincerely. 




 I used Spawn in Soul Calibur 2. He was the most boring of the 3 guest fighters by far. 




 Tanya though. 




 A, B, A, C, A, B, B. 









 I started out using Unbreakable because of the sweet ice mask. But as soon as I realised Grand Master  was simple a better version of Unbreakable I made the switch and never looked back.

I do miss the ice mask over the dumb medallion, but the message is clear, there's no reason to ever choose Unbreakable Sub-Zero in MKX. 




 This sub is the worst I'm subscribed to for random downvotes. If it ain't a sexy cosplay or some new crazy combo you can be sure people will be out in force with their downvotes. 




 I hate the way Sub-Zero seems terrible for combos compared to pretty much every other character in the game. I laugh when people call me a spammer for using a the klone a few times (a lot).

They're all like: "Spamming scrub!"

And I'm all like: "I'm using the tools provided to Sub-Zero, sorry I can't 40% meterless mid screen like [insert most other characters] can." 




 Hmm, perhaps. 




 Whenever I see characters busting out mega long combos I cry a little that Sub-Zero has fuck-all combos that go past 32%.

I mean, 46% METERLESS? OP much? 




 We'll see. 









 Didn't this come out starring Jim Carrey, and wasn't it really shit? 




 Enter Konami.  




 It's actually staggering how little I are about all this. The sooner normal service is resumed the sooner I can actually enjoy visiting reddit again.   




 Does anyone even know what Victoria did to get fired?

Downvoted for asking a question. Gotcha.  




 So it's a case of: "We don't like the way this organisation we're volunteering our time to is treating us. So instead of, I don't know, us leaving this site because we're dissatisfied with the way it's managed,  we're going to make it as unusable as possible and hope the site goes under. And fuck anyone who just wants to use it as is."

Gotcha. 




 How am I contributing to you supposedly losing the right to free speech? Surely making subreddits private and removing places where people can speak is harming that right more than me not giving a fuck about some woman being fired.  




 Wait until NRS gives you the skin. They can't not do it now the other ninja all have their klassic skins. 














 They really do. The amount of detail is much improved, there's way more foliage and the grass isn't just a flat blurry texture anymore. Most notable though is on the PS4 version the city doesn't struggle to load when you're going mega fast, on the PS3 version that was common place. And the frame rate is usually a steady 30fps on the PS4 version, the PS3 struggled to reach even 30.

Long story short the PS3 was barely powerful enough to run GTAV, and that was with low detail compared to the PS4 version.  




 Something on the Mega Drive I'd imagine. The first one I can remember though it Tony Hawk's Skateboarding on the PS1. Trying to beat a top score on one of the levels. Wow, that was the first time I think I experienced genuine rage at a game.

Like real, actual rage. 




 Layman's Terms/TL;DR version of the ramifications please. 




 I keep hearing how good the DLC for New Vegas was, never got any of it though. I did get all the DLC for FO3 and enjoyed most of that. 




 Yeah, looks that way. If it is a direct sequel to 3 it stands to reason that water has been purified, allowing communities to thrive more easily, and therefore be more populated and perhaps more technologically advanced. 




 I think the 3 copies of Fallout 3 I currently own will suffice, thanks. 




 Not a lot I could do about that. I saved the pictures from the socialclub website, and this was as big as they came. 




 I'll have to take your word for it, lol. 




 Click to enlarge. 




 Sometimes it seems like they don't really care if the game works properly, given the amount of shit that's gone wrong since launch. 




 Thanks. I should do some more on PS4 version sometime. These photos were taken over a year ago. 









 These are the teams I rotate through on faction wars:

Bronze:

Lin Quei, Shirai Ryu, Monk

Silver:

Sub-Zero, Scorpion, Farmer Jax

Kano, D'Vorah, Reptile

Jax Briggs, Sonya Blade, Kenshi (sorry)

Klassic Kitana, Ermac, (waiting for another silver to join them)

Gold:

Ninjutsu Scorpion, Shaolin Kung Jin, Inferno Scorpion

Stunt Double Johnny Cage, Possessed Kenshi, Sun God Kotal Kahn (sorry)

Warlock Quan Chi, Assassin Kitana, Raiden

Venomous D'Vorah, Injustice Scorpion, Bojutsu Kung Jin

Demolition Sonya Blade, (need Cassie or A-List Johhny), Balanced Kenshi (sorry)

I also just got Grand Master Sub-Zero and I plan to team him up with Hat Trick Kung Lao and Cryomancer Sub-Zero when I eventually get those.

All the gold cards were attained from gold kombat packs. 




 I really need a load of koins. When was the most recent koin challenge? 




 I maxed out the x-rays on my first gold team (Ninjutsu Scorpion, Shaolin Kung Jin, Inferno Scorpion) but never them because of all the power drain specials out there. So now I just upgrade character's first and second specials and leave it at that, since they're mega powerful anyway.

Is there any good reason to blow money on upgrading x-rays? 




 The answer is NOT. 









 Upvoted for the word gimbal.  




 [SENBAZURU!](https://imgflip.com/i/njv23) 




 **Man Wins Lawsuit After Neighbor Shotgunned His Drone**

That title. This is the world we live in right now. 




 Well, there's 10 unfunny minutes I'll never see again. 




 True, but they have story and dialogue, and a reason to be out in the wastes AS WELL AS picking up junk. Going out just for junk picking is the part I'm probably going to pass on.

Probably. 









 Running around picking up junk doesn't sound that fun to me. Doing quests is better. 




 But will they give us an encumberance limit that will accommodate the all the crap we'll need to be picking up? 




 Only in America. People in the UK tend to say one hundred AND twenty, or four hundred AND fifty nine. Americans seem to leave out the and altogether. 




 I also know that if you hold DOWN after throwing blanche (and after two interactions) she does a much better brutality.

Thanks for the info. 




 Yeah you can mute mid game in COD. But when you're playing a tense games of Search and Destroy and some moron joins who thinks people want to hear his shitty tinny music it can cost you the match sometimes. 




  you should have the option to mute people when you are playing

I've been saying this for years now. More games need an option to auto mute everyone by default, COD needs it badly. 




 It's totally annoying. I just go into a private party, that seems to stop their annoyances. 




 Would like to see. 




 Damn.  




 In England? 




 Ah. It makes sense to me now. Thanks for clarifying.  




 If GTAV wasn't sold out when I turned up to pick up a copy then Fallout 4 won't be. I don't think I've ever gone to buy a game on day one that was sold out. 




 Running into an immovable object is a real good way to get blown up. The trick is to approach from below, just getting to the top at stalling speed, then you don't need to slow down to land. 




 Why pre-order though? I'm just going to walk into my local GAME shop and buy it. 




 That's not flying, that's falling with style. 




 People still play Dying Light? I enjoyed it but never finished it for some reason. Haven't heard anyone mention it in months. 




 Same thing happened to me yesterday. Someone said if you uninstall then reinstall it should fix it. 




 It's not that hard to land a plane up there. 




 I don't get it. I know this that show full house. What does it have to do with generic brands and why is it funny? 




 I'm already bored of this game. It was great for the first week, but now I've got 97 dwellers and all rooms unlocked besides the Nuka cola one there really isn't anything left for me to do.  




 Anyone know when pred drops? 




 Too late. It hurt. The door was spiked you see.  









 Yeah, I just had to get it off my chest. 














 Isn't that modifier for infinite meter? 




 Or when Sub Zero uppercuts the forzen opponent's head clean off then tells them to "Feel the chill of despair". 




 I literally don't understand any of the comments I've read here. Something about Game of Thrones? 




 Skyrim. 




 I didn't know. Not everyone keeps up to date with all the upcoming content. I didn't know about the infrared skin until today either.  




 I don't like the way the article claims the Jurassic World is a reboot to the original when it's actually a sequel.  




 Well that's just awesome then.  
























 I'm gonna cheat and say 3.

 Probably a Lady Gaga video.

 James Bond is hunting, hunted and alone.

So it's a James Bond film then. 




 Be humble. 




 No it isn't. It's just a "what if" story. 




 Didn't Pixar just release a film? Are they rushing these things out now? 




 Looks more like heart shaped black fur rather than the nose being heart shaped. 




 All of them. All the double standards. 




 I have no idea how to feel about this film, I have mixed feelings about the last few.

Casino Royale = Awesome
Quantum of Solcae = Pure shit
Skyfall = Fogettable
Spectre = ?

Also, James going off the grid, is he making a habit out of this or is it just me? 




 Did you not blend it? 




 How is that a whale? Also this is a very frequent repost. 




 No you can't get a calorie count, however, I can get one for you. 














 A rapper doesn't actually live the life he portrays in his videos and media? Wow.

 It might take a while. But we'll have all the karmas eventually. 




 Is your sister 12 or a homophobe? 




 And back to you! (We may be onto something here) 




 Thanks. Have one back :) 




 But that's a cool trick. Never heard of it until now.  




 I did it the legit way, as I've done with everything in that game.  




 Ho Lee Fuk.

Would love to show them an iPhone. 




 Do you mean the whale from the film or the whale used to portray the whale in the film? 









 I like they way Sepp was avoiding the money like he was scared of it.

"Oh noes. This money is not dirty. I can't let it touch me!" 




 I know. I was explaining to him why you get the RPG before the homing launcher in an attempt to quell his confusion.

Downvoted for clarifying my position. Ok then. 




 I like to fly low to the ground and close to buildings, you can't beat the situational awareness of 3rd person IMO. If you're in VTOL mode trying to nail enemies first person doesn't cut it unless they're far away. When in air to air combat I can always get a better view of my opponent looking around with the right stick in 3rd person than I do in 1st person. By definition the 1st person view limits your range of vision compared to 3rd.

At least that's how I see it. 




 I rarely did the free roam myself, it felt empty because there was nothing to do other than kill people. My online experience with 4 was mostly just races. I'm glad GTA Online was a huge improvement and I look forward to what they do with GTAVI :) 




 Struggling to think of a more pointless mod than this.

I got nothing. 




 That still would have been a wrong title since I'm pretty sure OP isn't the youtuber RedKeyMon. 




 You say that, but TBOGT added the best helicopter in the damn game, Yusuf's golden Buzzard! 




 You peasant, be gone from me! 




 There's literally dozens of videos on youtube showing you where to land every single stunt jump successfully. 




 Not me. I got my RPG months before the homing launcher wsa added to the game.

The weapons added by updates aren't level locked, that's why you get it before the RPG. 




 It's the hyrda, brought back from GTA San Andreas. 




 Is staged. It's a stunt. 




 I couldn't disagree more. I prefer flying in 3rd person because you can actually see what's below you, in a plane you can't do that in first person.

Edit: Changed can to can't, as was initially intended. 




 OP should get his facts right. This is [Red Keymon](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm1F9GekuQVNf93XU7-i9kw), he does crazy stunts in GTA, and this was of course staged.

Source video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08F8hYlfDbc 




 Again? Oh no, wait. It's the same picture as before.  




 I doubt it will either. I doubt any will to be honest since I don't think they've done anything similar in the past. I'm still ok playing vanilla skyrim anyway, it's my favourite game.  




 He's not done yet I believe. Still, he won't look all that much like Red Skull. Maybe enough to resemble him.  




 Yeah they could. But I was just 18, they probably figured it wasn't worth it.

 The market for large swine ejaculate is LUCRATIVE.

I... I would imagine... 




 Back in 2003 I was working at McDonalds. When my friend came in I always gave him a little more than he asked for with his order. It escalated to the point where he would ask for a big mac meal and walk out with about 4 burgers, a load of nuggets, couple of drinks, and an apple pie or two.

Needless to say I was stupid but my manager wasn't. 




 I'm curious. At what point did you not see everyone losing their minds when he insinuated that immigrants are rapists and such? It was all over the web, and now here I an on a Monday morning hearing about him badmouthing a senator for the first time. 




 Wow. This really helps the bad image atheists have in America. I mean, this couldn't possibly make people think less of atheists, right?

How is this not just straight-up Christian propaganda?

I couldn't give a shit if someone wanted to pray before eating their meal in a restaurant.

 The title kind of diminishes the role of all mothers around the world who didn't give birth in a car.

"Thats the reminder that the birth is very natural thing"

And many women who give birth "in the wild" like this tend to suffer more complications than those in hospital. There's a reason people try to get to a hospital when they're giving birth.  




 I know, and the point I'm making is that I hated everything about Morrowind. I could only muster 5 hours before giving up because of the terrible mechanics, Oblivion was my first you see.

But I see their point too. Now I know Morroblivion is supposedly finished I'm totally going to give that a go because so many people claim Morrowind is the best one, and this is the only way I'd be able to tolerate playing it again. 




 I'm 30 with no kids.

Let's do this? 




 Until they remastered Skyrim or Oblivion. 




 I tried to play Morrowind after staring my ES adventures with Oblivion, but 5 hours in I hated literally everything about it. I'd love to play it through the eyes of Oblivion. It would give me a chance to enjoy the land and story without the mechanics I hated so much. 




 And so CDs die and everyone moves exclusively to digital downloads for their music.  




 That is the most context specific gif I've ever seen. It's.. it's glorious! 









 There's a big difference between doing something normal like driving a car or flying a plane which in many cases are necessary, and deliberately doing something very dangerous by choice when there's no need to.  




 Good point. I always forget about old Hyabusa.  




 He's been in every major release in the main series. 

I'm pretty sure he wasn't in Mortal Kombat Special Forces.  




 I like the way you felt like you had to clarify who Ryu was but not Slenderman or Spawn.  




 Another day, another person asking who we want to see as DLC. 

Seriously, can we rename this subreddit 
r/Whodoyouwantinfuturemortalkombatdlc already? 




 Man swimming in shark infested waters gets attacked by a shark.

Nothing unbelievable about it.  




 I've got no sympathy for people who swim in shark infested waters then get attacked by a shark. I feel the same way about those people as I do people who climb electrical towers and then get shocked.  




 The Grotti Turismo R, came as part of the business update back in the day. $500,000, one of the best cars IMO.  




 We built this city is an awesome tune! I'd stay if you played that.  




 I don't get it.  




 Ah I get it now. People played UMK3 in the arcades. Living in England (but not in a major city) the only time I ever got play an arcade machine as a kid was when the fair was in town. And even then, we were lucky to get MK1, and at 1 a go (which usually lasted no more than a couple of minutes) we didn't get to play on it all that much.

And so I keep forgetting about later MK games being released in the arcades.  




 No seriously, what colour is Pluto?  




 Ken Han is a deluded moron who spreads socially dangerous ideas and messages.  




 MK Trilogy was to UMK3 what UMK3 was to MK3. A better version with more characters.  




 I had it when I was around 13 I think on the PS1. Loved it. Had no one to play it with mind. But I'm pretty sure it had all the characters in the franchise up to that point. Including a playable Noob Saibot (my introduction to him), Rain's first appearance, and even various kostumes for some characters.

With Kano you could play as the MK1 or MK3 versions. Kung Lao MK2 or 3, Raiden (or Rayden back then) as MK1 or MK2 and some others too. The old versions were updated with kombos and shit.

MK Trilogy was to UMK3 what UMK3 was to MK3, simply a better version with more characters. This is why I'm always confused when people express love for UMK3 like it's the best version of the klassic MK games.  




 Nope. I just always loved the concept of freezing your opponent in place, loved it in the first game and never really branched out since.  




 I've heard of it. Being English I've never seen it and know nothin of it. 

And don't call me Shirley.  




 Why do people keep hailing UMK3 as the superior classic MK when MK Trilogy was a thing? It introduces brutalities (unless I'm mistaken) and you could play as fucking GORO, KINTARO, MOTARO, AND SHAO KHAN!

 




 When I was a kid me and my friends were convinced Cyrax was Scorpion because of him being yellow and the net was too similar to the spear.

We didn't a have access to lore and shit back then.  




 I liked Mk3, got it for my 11th (I think) birthday. By your logic UMK3 sucked, that's why the MK Trilogy exists.  




 It's not uncommon MK knowledge.  




 Sub-Zero has been my boy since Mortal Kombat 1. Always my go to guy. The day I realised he was the only character to be in all of them was almost as awesome as the time I found out Noob Saibot (easily my second fave) was the original Sub-Zero.

He's just the man.  




 Heard the name before, no idea who this woman is.  




 Genius. I love it. 




 Trouble's a brewing. 




 That was all fun and games, until I saw Ryan Dunn :'( I forgot how much I used to watch these guys in my teenage years and how seeing them again is almost like being with old friends once more.

I'm gonna call my Mum and tell her I love her. 




 MORE Liu Kang, Sub Zero, and King Lao costumes? They've got enough IMO. NRS should give some kostumes to the new characters and the dlc folks. Pay for a dlc character and get one kostume? Wtf?

Also klassic Raiden is already in the game. It's his MK1 outfit, can't get more klassic than that.  




 They did the MK1 classics in the last game. This game brought back the UMK3/MK Trilogy classics and I love it. I always choose sub zeros player 2 klassic skin because that's the colour he was in UMK3. The player 1 klassic skin has his darker MK4 colour for some reason.  




 Mk3 classics? Wat? 




 Great video. Glad you made it.  




 We just have to find a colour blind mushroom eater.  




 Nope. Just a case of "Isn't everyone sick of being asked this question yet? It's been answered at least 5 times at this point." 




 It's always my go to example of how something totally shit and mundane can be considered art and sell for loads of money. I thought art was supposed to take skill and talent. Anyone can roll out of bed and say "Welp, think I'll sell this bed and buy a new house." 









 Let me guess. American, right? 




 I love the way the firefighter took a couple of seconds to size up the guy and the situation before taking the guy down. 




 Noes Geralt not go around butchering people and cutting their heads off and such? 




 Yeah, so? Isn't that what they had to do to get Jason and Predator? 




 Didn't know that. But still, it's possible they could acquire the rights isn't it? 




 True, Jason is slow. Good point. 




 You prefer the bed piece? It's an unmade bed! If that is art then literally anything can be. Can't believe someone paid 150,000 for something they could easily have made at home, or unmade. 




 So it's official. We now have a cool new art style to appreciate.

Better than that modern bullshit.

["Oh wow, an unmade bed, pay me 150,000 for my art!"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Bed) 




 I don't know. He's slow (have you seen him run?), he's not known for gore, in fact most of the people he kills don't show gore.

I'm not saying he isn't cool, I'm just saying I don't think he's a good fit for the MK universe. 




 And now dambladge is how I'm going to say that word lol.

I was disappointed to find out that Reptile's slide doesn't go under projectiles. Sub-Zero has always been my main you see, and I'm used to being able to close distance when the enemy uses projectiles.

Just googled Reptil buffs and found this comment:

"Lol, I just checked the notes. He got NERFED if anything. Nerf to his nimble combos due to 4 having lower damage, buff to his absolutely pointless strings that no one uses. The only buff that matters is overhead doing 2 more damage but that doesn't affect him a lot exactly. Wow."

Can you confirm? 




 The only one I truly want :( 




 Don't know why you've been downvoted. That's actually not a bad idea.  




 And Starkiller. He was fun to use.  




 He's in Soul Calibur IV and would feel reeeeeally out of place in the MK universe. Predator, Jason, and Freddie felt ok because those films are known for their graphic violence and numerous fatalities. At least that's how I see it.  




 Nope. He wants characters that he enjoyed I. MK9 to be in this new game with its fancy new mechanics and features.  




 Sektoke.

Smytor.

You see where I'm going with this. 




 Another day, another person asking this question. Don't we all know which characters are wanted by this point? 




 I really wanted to enjoy using Reptile once they added the klassic skin, but he just feels underpowered compared to most others. Conglaturation on getting this trophy with Reptile! 




 It blows my mind how many people online can whoop my ass and yet I got that trophy on April the 22nd, three days after I got the game. 




 I can't quite believe I just spent 45 minutes watching someone fail to drill a lock off a door.  




 I came here because I almost saw my name in the title. 




 Is this the Kevin Smith/Andy McElfresh film? I thought about this just yesterday (after hearing th podcast many moons ago) and thought "I wonder if that film is still happening." 




 The way that kid backed off in fear. Looks like he's been on the wrong end of that guy before. 




 Take the ski mask off, that really sets them off.  




 The old speeding up to pass people on the street so you don't accidentally somehow make them think they're about to meet their doom. 

I know it well.  




 That music was just the same 5 seconds looped over and over for 4 minutes.

And the lead guitarist didn't look at the crowd. Not fucking once. He just kept shifting from one back-facing-the-crowd position to another.  




 I just finished watching that video. Great job here mate.  




 I just finished watching Man of Steel again for the time since release. 

This trailer makes me laugh at this film.  




 Who? Where? What?

Is this available now? 




 It's all relative. But you mentioned the 70's, not the 90's. 




 That's how I spend my money.  




 Rich people lead expensive lives. You get his with a cm few bad court cases and bam! No longer got the money for that expensive lifestyle.  




 That's what I thought. Thanks for clarifying.  




 You're no fun. 




 It says on tag in he gets "+100% basic damage".

Does this include the damage of his specials? 




 How dare you not take this seriously and actually try to make us laugh?

Get out! 




 So basically all the bad things on the internet should represent the internet and leave all the good stuff off?

Apart from boobs of course. Who doesn't love boobs?

Better? 




 [You mean like this, only in flag form?](http://i.imgur.com/9IvVY7e.jpg) 




 I would also have accepted "many giant strips of bacon". 




 A genuinely great submission. I think this could actually be the flag of the internet, if such a thing was required. No jokes, just truth. 




 Lol. Maybe you should submit one with enough Dickbutt in it. I feel under qualified to determine how much Dickbutt is enough Dickbutt. 









 I greatly enjoyed Sandstorm and Never Gonna Give You Up before the internet ruined them. 




  but I remember a time **not so long ago** that public displays of homophobic violence were frequently seen in the US. **Leading up to** American psychology dropping homosexuality as a mental illness in **the 1970's**[1] there were frequent acts of violence

 




 You don't "get" clickbait, you make it. 




 ITT: Way too many uses of the term "a women". 




 Finally. Someone put it into terms I can use to explain this to people.  




 Looks just like Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars on PS3.

Always loved the name of that game.  




 Well done.  




 SUCK-AAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!! 




 Every single "person" there that's not on fire is a reprehensible cunt that should be shot dead IMO.  




 They'd probably just put in the story character like Sindel, Baraka, Kabal, and Rain as they seem to be the most requested of the story characters. I can't see them soon smoke since he's a faction kill.

I don't care about those though, Noob is life.  




 I feel so redundant knowing that a creature with a relatively simple mind, no arms, and no legs can climb a tree without the aid of branches.  




 This makes me happy.  




 At first I thought the flagpole was in the back of his truck.

I was wondering how his freedom was going to fit under bridges. 

Edit: Added two words for grammar.  




 I like Bryan Cranston and all, but that was a bit of a dick response to a genuine question.  




 You didn't shorten it, you told a completely different story. This video doesn't explain the COD story, it explains the COD zombies story.  




 Yeah, iOS user here. Oh well.  




 Maybe when you're being entertained ed you consider it wanted time, but not me. Time spent having fun is time spent well in my opinion. But thanks for your insightful comment.  




 You can explain it quicker I'm sure. But this is obviously a very in depth look at it.  




 It's probably more in depth.  




 The game fails to load the cloud save for me after hanging on a black screen for ages. I then can choose to load the device save. But when I try a battle it hangs while looking for allies. Are their servers messed up or something? Anyone else having this issue? 




 I'm not blowing my precious koins on the chance to get that. I want it. But no doubt I'd be paying 70,000 to get cards I've already got, about 5 times. There's already so much I need to spend the koins on, like support cards, and trying to save up to promote Raiden and Liu Kang.  




 Just saw a video of a guy opening the pack and the cards DO NOT show up in the store after spending 850 souls you need to spends 850 souls every time you want to fuse them. Screw that. Looks like I'm not getting the new characters.  




 This post needs to be the top comment.  




 Ah nice always taken it as "No way am I reading all that text. Fuck it." 




 I doubt most people will watch it all in one sitting lol.  




 Or it was just that the zombies mode had very little story until BO2. It was mostly fan speculation that eventually became canon. Zombies was made in a rush as a direct response to horde mode in Gears 2, so they didn't have time to make a story. The game came first, then the story followed.  




 I reddit on my phone a bit too, but usually where there's wifi ;) 




 Are stating its TL;DW or are you asking what it means?

It's too long, didn't watch. 

Not sure why people would come to comments section to tell me they didn't watch it because it's too long. I said its 4 hours in the title! 




 Yeah pretty much. I'm certain most of the story is fan fiction made canon anyway. I just wanted to refresh myself on what happened to the characters and such.  




 Good for you. You came here to say that anyway? Cool.  




 Damn. No way I'm paying 40 to buy the amount of souls needed. Sucks.  




 Good question.  




 Lol. Cheating scum.  




 I think so. I haven't done tower battle since April.  




 Can you get Revenant Sub-Zero and Revenant Jax from the gold Kombat pack or do you need to save for 3 years to buy the new pack for 850 souls? 




 My only advice is you must get all the challenges done, all of them. You'll fail if you don't. Make sure you know what the challenge is just before the fight loads. If you do all 5(?) in a row you get crazy points. I think I took part in about 7-10 towers before I won one.  




 I did. The ending was brilliant.  




 How can someone boast about a good team if they cheated to get them? I don't understand hack-boasters. It's like when people on GTA Online say "I'm level 12 and I've got a tank, a hydra, a buzzard, and 20 cars!"

I'm all like, "So? I'm level 352, I have all those too. The difference being I actually put the time in to earn them." 




 If you're not good enough to unlock the skin then you don't deserve it.

Nah I'm joking of course. But I'm not sharing my ID with anyone. Good luck in your search. 




 Or you could be interested in it. I plan to play GTA Online later. During the many and lengthy loading screens I'll be playing Mortal Kombat X Mobile and listening to this video. Maximising my gaming lol.  




 You could have the audio going on in the background if you're worried about the video taking too much of your time up.  




 So does she work at Jamba Juice or eBay? 




 Ok. 




 As will I. During loading screens on GTA Online lol. 




 Sweet! A new AVGN video I've not seen. How did I miss it? 









 What's HK 97? 









 Uh, no. what would be funny about watching Jayden Smith act. Fresh Prince is funny, this would be painful. 




 And people laugh at me and call me manes when I refuse to go on rides like these.

At least I'm still alive. 




 ...and one count of being an accessory to being a bear. 




 70k to (most likely) get 3 gear cards I've already got is pretty steep. Ooh I can improve an item so my recovery goes from 13% to 14%. I have more important things to blow my koins on, I can still get gear as season rewards.  




 Well that sucks. Oh well. Thanks.  




 Does anyone know if Revenant Jax will be Netherrealm, or Special Forces, or both?
