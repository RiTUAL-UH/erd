 Well there is certainly no rush!  I'm just thrilled that you're working on it.  Can't wait to hear what you've come up with! 




 I love his tummy spot -- perfect for scratching and kisses!  I had a rat as well, who is no longer with us, but rats are awesome! 




 This is my plan B career. 




 Tongue is one of my favorite foods.  This ad makes me wish I could go to the store RIGHT NOW and buy some.  No joke. 




 I cannot upvote this enough.  Huzzah for you! 




 Please do!  Apollo is sitting here with me right now, and it's just so...quiet.  If only there was some sort of song playing... ;) 




 I noticed that too!  I'm guess that since the horse in question was a yearling, they are using the term "pony" incorrectly to mean a young horse.  Do some research people! 




 Oh I do hope it is!  Thank you!!! 




 Thank you GreivisIsGod!  Glad people are getting excited about this.  Maybe I'll get several submissions and Apollo can have different themes depending on his mood. :D 




 Maybe you can team up with someone?  You could do the words and music, and they could sing it for you?  Heck, even if you can't sing well, do it anyway!  Silly songs don't need perfect voices! 




 The dog in question is Apollo, a springer spaniel/golden retriever mix. I often sing to him about his greatness, his beauty, and his strength, but I'm no songwriter, and I think he deserves an anthem of sorts. I know that a song about Apollo would make my boyfriend incredibly happy, so this is a surprise of sorts for him!

First off, here are some photos of Apollo for inspiration: http://pineappleblurt.imgur.com/apollo#38wmp

Now, some Apollo facts:

- I often sing of how he crunches the bones of his enemies, and that he is the destroyer of Tirmok, and had pillaged and burned many villages and thatched roofed cottages.

- Apollo loves the water. He also loves tennis balls, bones, eating, and his eternal love -- our neighbor Deb.

- According to Apollo, no one ever feeds him. Dinner time for him is all the time.

- He was named not for the god Apollo, but for Apollo from Battlestar Galactica.

- He has a superhero alter ego named DarkFart, who fights crime under the cover of darkness.

This doesn't have to be an original melody. Something epic sounding, like the Soviet national anthem, would be incredible. Silly lyrics, about Apollo's unrivaled awesomeness, strength, and beauty, are a must. :D

Forward songwriters! I hope someone accepts my challenge! If I end up with an mp3 of a song all about Apollo, I'll be the happiest girl alive.

Edit: formatting 




 Thanks!  I shall cross post as suggested. 




 That is excellent!  Thanks for the info.  Also, I upvote this not just for the help, but also for the hilarious name of the website. 




 This is so exciting, yokaishingami!  Thank you!

 I have some things!  Most of my shirts are XS or S, and I do have 1 or 2 sized pants and dresses.  Let me raid my closet and see what I can find for you.   




 They are all so cute! 




 How exactly do you get out there? 




 I feel for you.  This March I got some bad sunburn while wearing an earflap hat and large sunglasses.  It looked...interesting. 




 My friend is going to have a boy in August!  She and her husband aren't terribly "in need", but they are grad students, so things aren't all sunshine and lollypops either!  Can you message me your email address and I can put them in contact with you if they are interested?  They aren't Redditors. 




 The Bulldog, either in St. Paul or NE Minneapolis.  Super tater tots too! 




 Thanks for the info you guys!  I didn't have much time to look around while I was at the show, but I did get to the American Saddlebred Museum and the Barn of Champions (got to meet Cigar!).  It was a great show venue and we had a great show!  Check it out: https://www.shaneshifletphoto.com/dspProofImage.asp?width=1210 show=2011%20Bluegrass%20Morgan\Saturday%20Morning\128%20-%20Hunter%20Pleasure%2C%20Ladies%2C%20Championship image=128-061-11BM.JPG
 




 Hmmm...I find this silly. 




 How does 143 mean I love you? 




 Ah!  SQUEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!! 




 Nice outfit, Riblet!  Also, GREAT dog name, knaps! 




 Your daughter is seriously cute.  Cutest kid I've seen in a long time! 




 I hope you guys do this again another time.  I'm out of town this week, but I'd love to bring my dog at some point! 




 Thanks for the info.  I'm going for the Bluegrass Morgan Classic -- I know there are several shows going on at the same time at the Horse Park this weekend.  There is going to be so much to see, and probably not enough time to see it all! 




 I have Morgans too!  Nice to know another Morgan Redditor! 




 I'll be heading down this week to Lexington for a show at the Horse Park.  It's my first time there, and there is so much to see!  I know I won't have lots of time in between showing my horse, so for those of you who have been there, what were your favorite things?  What should I skip?   I'm for sure checking out the Saddlebred museum, and I'd like to see some of the famous horses there. 




 What is the difference between "yellow" and "lemon"? 




 I liked Mirror of Korea ok, but when I ordered the Bibimbap they COOKED THE EGG YOLK ALL THE WAY THROUGH.  The runny yolk is what makes that dish! 




 He is wonderful!  You should crosspost this on r/equus. 




 Are you kidding?  I WOULD LOVE THIS!  Do they make them for big kids? 




 Yeah, I don't live there anymore -- now I'm in Minneapolis.  But I still go back to Roscoe quite often to visit my folks. 




 Sweet!  Roscoe is represented on Reddit!   




 Is that Hononegah high school? 




 NOT a stupid question!  I do mine damp (wet and rung out).  Not sure what would happen if you do it dry...let's not find out. 




 Also related, you can kill all the nasties on a sponge by zapping it in the microwave for 2 minutes.  Careful -- resulting sponge will be hot and steamy. 




 Merrils are awesome!  Another way to take care of your feet while still being frugal is to get a pair of prescription orthodics crafted by a podiatrist.  While the initial investment is pricey ($200?) they last for-freakin-ever (they are made of a material called Superglass, a type of fiberglass).  I got some 10 years ago because I have extremely high arches and it was killing my knees to walk.  Now they go in all the shoes I wear (except heels) and it really don't matter if I buy cheaper shoes that have no arch support (like Converse) because my orthodics are in there.  Any shoes I want, and no knee pain! 




 Shoes.  Buy good shoes.  If you buy crappy shoes you will mess up your feet over time and when you mess up your feet, you mess up the rest of you (knees, hips, back, etc.)  

I buy all my clothes secondhand, but always purchase top quality shoes! 




 Enchilada bake is the best freakin' thing ever.  Get an 8x8 pan and open a can of enchilada sauce.  Put a little bit of sauce in the bottom so things don't stick, and begin layering -- tortilla, black beans, cheese, sauce, tortilla, beans, cheese sauce, etc. until you get to the top of the pan (usually about 3 layers).  Then top it off with any leftover sauce and cheese and throw it in the oven.  350 for...I don't know...25 minutes?  You know, until it's bubbly and hot-looking and done.  

Hella tasty, impossible to mess up, cheap to make, and great for lunches. 




 I am also building credit, and I only use my card for groceries.  Even if I don't put much on it, I'm paying it off in full each month, and therefore build credit.  I have a Chase Sapphire card along with a Chase rewards debit card (I bank with them, but they have credit cards available in general).  Also, the US Bank Flex Perk cards are very highly ranked. 




 D'AWWWWWWW!  Darling!
 




 My dad convinced his secretary that bison dig holes in the ground to live in while they hibernate in the winter.  I convinced this same woman that a local water tower was actually a hot air balloon. 




 Your dog is darling.  What is he/she? 




 I had one of these guys too.  We named him Earl the Squirrel.  I found out upon bringing him to the Wildlife Rehab Center that squirrels of this age (just out of the nest) don't really understand danger and routinely approach people, just like Ruppert did.  Earl did the same to me, hopping onto my foot and looking scared.  You would think squirrels would have evolved a better sense of fear after all these years.  Nevertheless, Earl was super fun to have.  We used to nap on the couch together and watch Jeopardy.   




 Folding myself in half backwards, and other contortionist-like abilities. 




 I've had this all my life but never knew it had a name!  I have asked eye doctors about it, but none of them have ever told me about visual snow.  Makes it incredibly difficult to see at night, especially things like holes in the ground while walking in the dark.  Glad to know it's a real thing, and I'm not just completely insane. 




 Thanks!  Wish this topic would make it to the front page -- I want to see more pictures of people's horses! 




 Guys always laugh when I tell them how sexy I think forearms are, and yet here we are, so many of us loving forearms.  Especially when the guy is wearing a plaid shirt with the sleeves rolled up.  *drool* 




 I'm just finding this thread now, and I'm thrilled there is a subreddit for horses!  Here are my two Morgans, Baby (chestnut) and Rillo (bay).  Baby is Rillo's mom, so it's a family affair when we show!

http://pineappleblurt.imgur.com/3GH12#49hIR 




 Just found this subreddit now!  Some great Saddlebred magazines are:

Saddle and Bridle - http://www.saddleandbridle.com/
The National Horseman - http://www.tnh1865.com/
Saddle Horse Report - http://www.saddlehorsereport.com/

Also, this is a complete list of books written specifically about Saddlebreds: http://www.trot.org/forum/showthread.php?t=2158 however many of these you would have to find used/vintage.

From a fellow Saddlebred lover, I hope this helps! 
























 Cute overload. 




 I love that you call him "The Chew".  My friends dog looks nothing like Chewbacca, but can make the Chewbacca noise on command.  It. Is. AWESOME. 




 He is beautiful!  And his face looks so wise. :) 




 I do wish that I had seen this about 3 month ago.  I really wanted to live in that direction.  Alas, too late! 




 Cool!  And I also hope that there are some LA firms there.  I'll try to check it out if I can get over there after word, and will spread the word among the grad students! 




 Hey lady_elayne!  Nice to know I'm not alone!  You should PM me and tell me ALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL about your Saddlebreds!  I'm a Morgan girl myself, but I've ridden and shown my share of Saddlebreds and Hackneys as well. 




 Thank you!  And no, you didn't sound too "judge-y". :)  




 Sorry to confuse, captainstag!  And you're right, just like anything (even riding in general) it can be done well and to the advantage of the horse, or poorly to the ultimate disadvantage of the horse. 




 Ah I see.  Since I'm a Morgan person, I'm more on the "fewer aids" side of the camp too.  And yes, the clump of dirt!  Always a big hit with my horse too.  But ohhhhh the dreaded baby powder bottle...all you have to do is pick it up!  He clearly thinks it's going to eat him. XD 




 Oh man, my horse LOVES the fire extinguisher -- he thinks it's hilarious. :)

And to answer your question, I show Morgans.

What do you mean when you say that Arabs are one of the more natural breeds?  Do you mean for saddleseat?  Because my view was always that the Arabs were the most unnatural saddleseat horses, simply because their motion (historically) was to move with lower action and a sweeping stride to cross desert sands efficiently, not to step high and raise the knees.  I know that they are now breeding for the bend at the knee, but I don't know how true it is to the breed's origins.  Your opinions? 




 I'd love to know what you do to your soil to get those nice onions!  We have onions, but they are always small and never get to be the nice, large onions we would like.  Doesn't matter which variety we try, they are always puny. 




 Well, the equitation is completely different - so comparing a saddleseat rider to a hunter/jumper rider is like comparing apples and oranges.  To effectively ride our horses we need to sit back, legs away from our horse's sides, hands elevated.  Saddleseat equitation should look like this: http://www.discoverhorses.com/saddle-seat-equitation.html  Of course, there are people out there that ride like this (ick):http://www.uphaonline.com/images/charming.jpg

If course, the same goes for any discipline. I founded and formed an equestrian team at my college and was the only non-jumper person.  I was SHOCKED at the lack of ability in most of the riders.  So many of them were pushed to jump before they really had developed a seat.  I think this is why jumping is seen as "dangerous", simply because people haven't really learned how to "sit" yet.

And yes, I've done LOTs of cross-training.  My mare transitioned to huntseat years ago, so for the past several years I've been riding both Saddleseat and Huntseat, and I've had to develop two different forms of equitation depending on which horse I'm riding.  I've also done hunter/jumper stuff in college, some dressage, and LOTS of driving.  I think everyone should take a "vacation" from their discipline and try something else for a few months!  It's so helpful.  

You can judge my equitation for yourself if you like, I'm by no means an "equitation rider" and was never trained as one, but this is how I sit when I ride huntseat.  http://i.imgur.com/jFVcm.jpg 




 I can't follow you captainstag.  What about horses that wear Easyboots?  Do you think that horses shouldn't wear shoes at all?  Show horses' longer feet and weighted shoes cause no ill effects.  Many show horses compete into their 20's and are completely sound.  I wish I had a picture of my horse's feet -- they're really not that much longer than your average horse.

I do think that the TWHs stress out their horse's joints in the "big lick" division.  Those shoes are huge, heavy, and throw the entire stance of the horse off.  AND they ride two year olds that way!  Those horses are too often crippled before they hit 10.  So sad. 




 No, he only wears it in the summer, and that's only on days leading up to a show.  Also, it's it really hot we just leave it off.   




 Hey FlameGirl!  I'll go through these one by one:

1) You can do some things to encourage head and neck position, but most of all the horse has to be built for it.  My horse is not, that is is why he because a hunter and not a saddleseat-type horse.  However, assuming the horse is upheaded to begin with, the upheadedness and head carriage come from a) building muscle and b) collection.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.  Dumb jockeys are used, taking the place of a rider when a horse isn't being ridden.  They help teach a horse the proper "frame" to be in.  When we ride, our hands are elevated to meet the elevation of our horse's head and neck.  While riding, you can bump and tickle your snaffle bit to ask the horse to keep his head up.  Of course, none of this is possible without good impulsion from the hind end.  When a horse pushes off its hind end, it elevates its front end.  There are plenty of horse that go around the ring with their head down because they are not collected and pushing off the hind!  

2) I don't know much about rollkur.  I've never seen it used outside of dressage. :/

3) The rider sitting farther back on the horse does not have any ill effects on the horse's back.  Morgans, Saddlebreds, etc. have a center of gravity that is in the middle of their back (they are built in an upright fashion) as opposed to a thoroughbred or quarter horse whose center of gravity is over the shoulders.  The saddles are designed to sit in the middle of the horse's back and the flaps are cut back to free up the horse's shoulders and not impede their movement.

4) Whips are used pretty much like they are in any other discipline I suppose.  Lots of riders show without whips.  I rarely use them, even at home when training.  Sometimes they are carried as a "prop", especially in equitation classes, and I carry one in the ring sometimes because my horse tends to focus and listen better if I'm holding it.  Otherwise, it's just an aid, as it is with anything else.

5)  Many Saddlebreds and Hackneys have had their tail "set".  In other words, a muscle in the underside of the tail has been cut to allow the tail to stretch up and bend over at the top.  Some people think that the tail bone is broken, which is not the case (and would be awful!).  My horse is a Morgan, so this type of procedure is illegal for our breed.  He does, however, wear a bustle in his stall to encourage an "arched" tail carriage.  Desired Morgan tail carriage looks like this: http://www.playmorfarm.com/Play_mor_farms_stallions/stallion_images/centerpiece-thumb-2010-2.jpg  Desired Saddlebred tail carriage looks like this: http://www.goinggaited.com/Born_Contender_al_12-4-06.jpg

Feel free to ask follow up questions! 




 The topics that always come up with "abuse" in the saddleseat world generally has to do with several things: shoeing, soring, and training aids.

1) Saddleseat horses wear weighted shoes, and their hooves are grown out longer than, say, a thoroughbred's hooves.  Many people see this as strange because their horses don't have feet like this, and thing that a) the shoes are heavy and hurt the horse and that b) the hooves lose the proper angle when they are grown out and it is detrimental to the horse's legs.  The shoes are, in actuality, quite light.  We have to realize that we're dealing with a 1000 lb animal, and the shoes weigh a matter of ounces.  Also, when the hooves are grown out longer, proper angles HAVE to be maintained for the horse to be sound and happy, so it's actually very important to keep the angles correct.  Of course there are crappy farriers out there, but that can happen to any horse of any breed/discipline.  It is also important to point out that hoof length and shoe length are strictly regulated -- every time I leave the ring after a class there is a steward there measuring my horse's hooves, making sure we are within the regulations. 

2) People often think that Saddlebreds, Morgans, National Show Horses, etc. are "sored" in the fashion that some Tennessee Walking Horses are.  In the TWH world, some trainers (not all) apply chemicals to the legs of the horses that burn or cause pain, causing the horse to lift its legs high to try and get away from the sensation.  It's abusive, but it does work, and the reason it works for TWHs is that they are gaited (meaning they perform a running walk) and do not perform a trot.  A sored horse will look lame at the trot (because they are).  Therefore, soring for trotting breeds is irrational.  Even a Saddlebred that can perform the two extra "gaited horse" gaits (the slow-gait and rack) still have to trot in the show ring, and a sored horse would stick out like, well, a sore thumb.  I do not condone what is done to the Walking Horses, and will never be about to understand how the owners and riders of these horses can put their horses through this and still say they love them.  

3) Training aids used in the saddleseat world are things like stretchies and chains.  Stretchies are simply a length of rubber surgical tubing that is connected between the horses front legs to provide resistance.  They look like this: http://i.imgur.com/vpc0W.jpg.  Have you done this at the gym? http://www.health.com/health/static/hw/media/medical/hw/h9991377_001_02.jpg  It works the same way, building up the chest and shoulder muscles of the horse -- this can create a higher step through improving muscle tone.  Some horses, like my horse, don't use them -- they take short steps to avoid them, basically looking at me and saying "yeah...whatever". :)  As for chains, they are places like bracelets around the horse's ankles, and again, encourage a higher step.  The combination of a bit of weight (think ankle weights) plus the looseness of the chain (the chain flings forward when the horse trots, and carries the foot a bit with it, creating a higher, more open step).  Here is a picture of a horse trotting wearing chains.  You can see how the chain is flinging forward on her hind leg http://morganshowcase.com/Listing.php?HorseName=Wonderful%20Tonight Page=Photo Order=4.  Some folks think that these chains are exceptionally heavy, but really, they're just chains.  Perhaps like one you'd lock up your bike with.  Kids put them on their feet at horse shows and pretend to be "show horses" all the time.  There is also the misconception that the chains bang onto the horses feet causing as "soring" effect.  Again, soring a trotting horse doesn't work, and moreover this is not an effect of using chains.  Some chains come coated, padded, or are wrapped to prevent any sort of injury from occurring, and many horses get worked with their legs wrapped and boots on.  An added bonus of riding a horse wearing chains is that they jingle, and it's a good exercise for riders to listen to the rhythm of the chains to determine their horse's stride, cadence, and speed.

Wowzers, that got long!  Thanks for your questions CaptainCorpsie! 




 Hello fellow Reddit equestrians!  I have been constantly seeing forum after forum of people blogging, posting, and ranting about "show horse abuse" in all disciplines, and one that always arises are the Saddleseat horses.  I read the comments, I look at the examples, and generally people who make negative comments are doing so because they're not sure what the discipline is all about, and don't understand the training, riding, and showing of these horses.  

Also, many people don't know what Saddleseat is at all, which is understandable since it's sort of a small world compared to the western and hunter circuits.

So here I am, a saddleseat rider putting myself out there.  AMA!!! 




 You're welcome! 




 Well, marathons ARE very impressive! :D  So yes, maybe you do have HMS, but isn't it great that someone could basically throw you off a building?  I have video of me getting thrown very hard off of a horse and when I hit the ground, I bounce. 




 aaaaaaaaaand that looks like me. 




 I was, and still am, that girl. 




 Some people with HMS can certainly still run, it's just not one of the things I'm able to do.  I wouldn't rush into the doctor, but next time you go in for a check up you might want to mention it.  They may look at you right there, or if you like, you could have them refer you to a rhumatologist (that's who diagnosed me).  

The back pain may be unrelated, as many people have back pain, but the sprains and dislocations could be a sign of HMS.  Have you ever broken a bone?  I tend to sprain/dislocate in situations where other people may break (falling off horses, having a horse fall on top of me, etc.).  I wonder if you are the same.

Also, it's AWESOME that you compete in marathons -- something I would love to be able to do! 




 Fortunately, I do not have the life-shortening form of Ehlers.  The rarer forms are quite debilitating and deadly.  And yes, I have very soft and stretchy skin.  I have a huge wenis! http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=wenis 




 I can and I do!  I can't do some things -- like if I do pushups I basically dislocate my shoulders, but I do squats, flys, presses, etc.  It actually helps to do some strength training because it builds up muscle around the joints which helps them stabilize. 




 I'm worried about having kids for this very reason, and also because I'm afraid I'll pass on the HMS to my children.  I score a 7, so we're pretty close in the regard.  What exactly happened when you were pregnant? 




 I can't tell you what the difference is, and there is a recent study that shows they aren't different at all.  There are several types of Ehlers Danlos, and hypermobility is one of the types.  I do have the elastic skin, and I break blood vessels and veins all the time.  I bruise like a ripe peach too, so I never know what exactly to call what I have.  I just stick with calling it "hypermobility".   




 Oh yes, it is ALL about the impact.  The elliptical machine at the gym and I are BFFs. 




 The best way to be!  Now go freak out all of your friends!!! 




 I have been diagnosed by a doctor.  I was diagnosed when I was about 13 or 14. 




 Those are definitely the two camps that people split into!  Typically, people who are into medicine are in the "ooooOOOOOoooo" camp and most other people are in the "OH GOD MAKE IT STOP" camp.  My boyfriend is used to it, but I think it still freaks him out on occasion -- especially the hands.

I don't demonstrate very often, and I do think there is something to be said for the theory that demonstrating makes things go bad faster.  You keep stretching and stretching every time you do it, so at the very least, you're not making things any better.  But yeah, I do it in my sleep, and there are also things I do that I figured were normal, and apparently aren't.  I scared the crap out of a yoga instructor once. :)

As for the running vs. biking, for me it's definitely not an issue of fitness.  I work out and my recovery time is amazing, but once I start to run, all kinds of shit starts to go down.  Basically, when I run and my body is subjected to the impact of the running motion, my legs can't hold themselves together.  So then my muscles try to compensate for the loose joints and overtax *themselves* and then my heart begins to work overtime trying to get blood and oxygen to the muscles.  My doctor told me to not take up regular running, as it may overtax my heart.  




 One other idea is to go the the Red Stag Supperclub on Tuesdays, which is their "Cheap Date Night".  Two entrees, a bottle of wine, and two desserts for $32, and the atmosphere is wonderful.  A nicer place where you could dress up a bit and make an occasion out of it.  Call ahead for reservations though, the deal is very popular! 




 I went into the doctor thinking I had juvenile arthritis.  When she found no sign of that, she started putting me through flexibility tests and basically tied me into a knot on her exam table.  She got it right on the nose that it was HMS, but other doctors thought it was just "growing pains" even though I hadn't grown in years, or didn't have an explanation.  Not many docs I've meant know about it, and so I educate every medical student I run into about HMS!  I sat next to one on the plane and we started talking about it -- he had just studied it in class and was fascinated that he was sitting next to a living embodiment of his textbook!   




 I found out about the name ON REDDIT!  Hooray for Reddit!  And yes, you are not alone. :D 




 Thanks for pointing out that this is serious, dizzysparrow.  While it is entertaining, there is quite a bit of pain associated with it.  I partially dislocate things all the time -- they often pop back in on their own shortly after, but that doesn't mean it doesn't hurt.   I've also sprained my left ankle 18 times, usually just by walking down the sidewalk, and my right 13 times.  This to me is "normal".  

As for how it effects my daily life, it depends.  I cannot hold a pen for very long, so I take all notes on my laptop when I'm in classes.  Winter is the hardest -- my hands and legs stiffen up and I have problems holding onto things and moving my fingers.  I was in a drawing class this winter where I had to hold a pen for hours.  I would have to come home at night and use hot packs on my hands to ease the pain.  Of course there is the obvious -- I can't run, so fun co-ed sports are out (mostly) and I have to invest in a gym membership to stay fit since I can't just go running (though I do bike in the summer).  I believe that the worst thing about HMS is that people can't tell you have it, and therefore can't understand why you hurt or think you are "whiny".  If you looked at me walking down the street, I look no different than most people aside from a slight limp I sometimes have.  You cannot always see pain. 




 ZOMG BENDY ZOMBIES!!! 




 Interesting to know.  I read that myopia can be related, so I figure that it could be a lack of strength in the eye tissues causing it, but since they're not sure what causes visual snow, who knows? 




 I am really good at goofing-off wrestling!  Someone thinks they have me pinned and then BAM!, I'm bent in half backwards giving them an epic wedgie. 




 It may, or you may just be flexible.  Do you have the associated chronic pain?  Or are you just delightfully bendy? 




 My pain did not subside when I finished growing that I can remember, but my pain also got worse when I was 13 or 14.  I stopped growing when I was 11, so I hadn't even hit puberty yet.  I'm really not sure how your son will be effected, but my doctor believes that as my body naturally tightens up with age (the way normal people become "stiff" with old age), I will simply become more normal and the pain will subside.  

It's interesting to hear about your son's hamstrings.  Mine are also incredibly tight -- I can't even touch my toes despite being so flexible, but I've never had any physical therapy done to loosen them up, or heard of any positive reason to do so, but I sure hope it is helping your son.  As for things like sports, let your son play!  I'm not sure where you stand on this, but don' let his EDS hold him back.  I was a three sport athlete in high school (before I was told to stop running) and had no ill effects.  I am currently an internationally competing equestrian, and I can tell you that horseback riding is great exercise for EDS kids.  Balance, muscle tone, and cardio all without the impact of running.  It is something I can do with few problems.

Tell your son to hang in there and use ice/hot packs when the going gets tough.  If you have any other coping questions let me know! 




 Here are some photos for you all.  I can't take my two favorite poses because that would require another person (me bending in half backwards touching my toes to my forehead and me popping my shoulder blades out like a spiny dinosaur), but maybe I can get them later today.

Me bending my fingers backward (no this does not hurt) http://i.imgur.com/51PjQ.jpg

My fingers bending by themselves (without me pushing them back).  I can hold a tennis ball this way!  http://i.imgur.com/y5sc6.jpg

How I type.  Palms stay flat on the laptop, and only my fingers move: http://i.imgur.com/RLVPL.jpg

 From your description it sounds like she may, though I have no business diagnosing people.  Does she have chronic pain?  Aches in her joints and muscles?  It is possible to have hypermobility without the pain -- my mom has it as well (it is genetic) but can run and do things I can't do.  My 63-year old mom can outrun me!  

Of course, if she does gymnastics, yoga, pilates, or other "stretching" forms of exercise, it could simply be from that.  You can "become" a bit hypermobile through certain exercises. 




 Well, if you're referring to sexual positions (which I'm guessing you are), it IS rather beneficial.  You can basically put any part of my body anywhere you like.  

On a more serious note though, there can be complications with pregnancy, and this condition is genetic, so he and I both have some concerns about having kids, if we ever choose to.  I can't say I would want my future children to go what I've been through.    




 Huzzah!  Don't let the haters get you down, man. 




 Haha!  Now that I'm sitting here at my desk trying it out, I would say that yes, it is rather easy. 




 I like you too kaizerfloyd!   




 I have always been a bendy individual, but chronic pain in high school
sent me to the rheumatologist to figure out what was going on with my
body. Turns out I have hypermobility syndrome, sometimes called benign joint hypermobility syndrome (BJHS) and, more recently, believed to be the same as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_joint_hypermobility_syndrome#Hypermobility_syndrome.

I also have visual snow (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_snow)
but I'm not sure if there is any correlation between the two, since
little research on visual snow has been done.

I sprain all the time, I type like a freak (according to my
boyfriend), I sleep in positions that look like I've been in a
horrible accident, and I can't run (my legs can't handle it), but I do
live an active and joyful life despite my rebellious body! AMA!

Edit: pictures have been taken and are linked below! 




 Well, he has a son...so too late!  Also, from what I have seen/heard, he is a FANTASTIC father.

 *hugs fellow Artie-loving Redditor* 




 Whoever made this, bless you for including Artie - The Strongest Man in the World. 




 Mine looks almost identical too, but probably larger from what I can see in the photo.  He is springer spaniel/golden retriever.  http://imgur.com/F8o6g  Maybe the postman's dog was a golden?   




 When I was a little kid I thought that the Colonel Sanders logo was a chicken nugget with a face and tie.  




 I second what amaltheas2 has said.  As another horse owner/rider/competitor of many years, stick to riding lessons, and lease a horse before you buy.  If you are going to eventually buy a horse for your children, make sure you have a professional trainer you know and trust try out the horse for you, and also have your kids try out the horse to make sure it is suitable for them and their riding abilities.  Also, even if your kids are small DO NOT buy them a pony.  Ponies are smart, quick, and sometimes rather mean.  Even though they seem more intimidating because they are larger, get an older horse for your children instead.  It may be a longer way to fall off, but they will most likely fall off much less often.  Be safe and good luck! 









 I've always thought royal blue looked great on lighter, redder bays, but I'm not sure what colors they have.  I'm sure she'll look great in any color! 




 1: Awesome coloring job.

2: You are some serious eye candy (assuming you're the guy in the photo). 
























 Glad you are enjoying it everyone!  I ride again tomorrow night (Saturday) at the very end of the evening session.  I'm number 422, see if you can spot me! 




 Too cute!  And what a great mare -- you two can do anything together! 




 You can watch the show as much as you like for free!  They have live feeds from all three show rings (which work simultaneously), but most of the action goes on in the Coliseum.  I'll be showing my horse tonight in the Hunter Pleasure Amateur World Championship.  Evening session begins tonight at 7pm central time.  Have fun watching! 









 Go Morgans!  Proud to see my breed do so well! 




 They are an incredibly beautiful family!  Men so sexy, kids so cute!!!! 




 They are an incredibly beautiful family!  Men so sexy, kids so cute!!!! 




 AWWWW!!!!!  What breed?  You guys are the cutest! 




 I had a baby squirrel once as well, and then he was rehabbed and released into the wild.  His name was Earl. :) 




 The day I met him, I deleted my account.  True story. 




 My experience on OkCupid ended with me finding my boyfriend.  Coming up on 2 years together this winter.  We are a happy family (family = the two of us and the dog)! 




 He actually has TWO thermals, because last Halloween I *almost* got him to go as Dexter.  He looks incredibly sexy in them.  I wish I had pictures of THAT to share with you! 




 Here you go:  http://i.imgur.com/qdnoF.jpg (with our dog Apollo) and also http://i.imgur.com/JMLF4.jpg.  Perhaps not the best pictures of him, but the ones that are the most "Dexter-y".  :)  See what you think.  He claims there is no resemblance! 




 My boyfriend looks like Dexter, but he won't believe me.  Either way, they are both hella sexy.   














 I hope it is delicious!  On a side note, you have the best username ever. 




 I've learned to love mine my naming all of them.  The best one is Weeb, and his dog Ghosty. 




 I thought it was normal too until about 10 years ago when my friends gently explained that I was a freak. 




 Oh man, his beard looks nuzzleable. 




 Tall, sexy, great voice, glasses...what more could a woman want? 




 So hot.  So hilarious.  Dibs. 




 YES!  This is the secret game I play on the bus each morning on the way to class. 




 I want to rip all seven of those shirts off of him! 




 I want to rip all seven of those shirts off of him! 




 AH YES!  I have the biggest ladyboner for him.  And this picture is my favorite.  It's gotten to the point that just seeing radishes like these gives me a ladyboner!  And when he wears a plaid shirt and rolls up the sleeves, and you get to see those forearms...*swoon*

I've met him a couple times, and not only is he a total hottie, he is also a humble sweetheart.  A very nice guy!   




 Holy ladyboner!!!   




 He has such a great beard.  Good beard is key. 




 Major swoon, and such magnificent forearms!!! 




 I call second dibs. 




 That would be awesome!  They need little BSG uniforms. 




 Oh this happens all the time!  The Crazy Color Breeders as I call them.  I had to ride some National Show Horses back in the day that were all bred to be pinto, and most of them looked like they had been put together by a committee, and few of them had a brain.

There are, of course, some really excellent uniquely colored horses out there!  I just like a good horse, no matter what color it happens to be. 




 BAHAHAHA!  Man, I want a ninja to defend my uterus.  




 I think he's sharing something painful that is happening to him, and is also proud of his grandfather for the fight he put up.

I'm going to stop replying to you now, and you'll probably see it as a victory for yourself, but really it's me having better things to do than argue with you. 




 I don't think that is what the OP is doing here.   




 I don't like you. 




 It's nice, he's a culturally aware sociopath.   









 Ahhh so this happens after the egg has already cooked.  I must try this!
 




 I, too, live in Minnesota.  Just wait until winter.  Then the bitching will commence. 




 I must understand how this works.  Putting the chopstick there to create the shape I understand, but the shell is still on.  How does it get though the egg's mighty armor? 




 That.  Is.  Terrifying. 




 Well the horse isn't fat, she's pregnant.  She'll be fine. :) 




 I love that it's wearing an oven mitt. 




 I had the ever-dreaded sunburn from snow, and I was wearing sunglasses with an earflap hat.  I *wish* I had pictures. 




 Whatever he is, he's sexy. 




 Upvote for ponies. 




 THIS!  I look at my boyfriend's can of abpa all the time and think, "what the hell is abpa?" 




 I'm a big fan of Baker Creek Heirloom Seeds.  Added bonus: their catalogs are beautiful!  




 Adorable!  For some reason I think she looks like the dog Martha from the TV show "Martha Speaks".  I think it's the expression. 




 I too own an Apollo, but his full name is Mr. Apollo Happypants Creed. 




 upvote for ears 




 Also with a name engineered for cuteness! 




 I've always liked the name Finn for a dog.  He looks like a Finn. 




 Starbuck!  She is super cute!  Mine is Apollo, also after BSG!  (http://i.imgur.com/8OuAw.jpg) 




 Ah yes, my dog is all about the bathtub.  He will also hop into the shower with you to get water if you don't close the bathroom door. 
























 There's a Breyer horse in it's box in there!  I see it!  I collect those man.  I wonder which one it is? 




 upvotes for forearm love! 




 I love draft mules!  How is Sunny to ride?  I've thought about getting a mule as a for fun/trail mount someday. 




 Me too!  I lust after him whenever I watch Party Down. 




 Ohhhhhhh my you are a lucky lady!  If you ever get tired of him, I call dibs!  :) 









 SO cute.  What a tolerant little guy!  My horse would give me a withering look to end all withering looks if I did that to him. 




 Oh he is lovely, and so talented.  I love that this picture is so high res that I can zoom in and examine his sexy stubble! 









 I think Mythbusters should try to reenact this one... 




 The gloves I have are amazing, and are currently on sale for $15!  They are engineered for people with arthritis (they support your joints and reduce hand fatigue), but myself and many of my friends use them because they really DO reduce hand fatigue while riding and they are an all around great glove.  Plus, they are machine washable!  Nice enough that I wear mine in the show ring.  http://www.bionicgloves.com/shop/?cat=31 id=43 




 Your taco is indeed beefy!  I approve.  Too bad it would be weird to share...or clone him.   




 Since it sounds like the saddle will be used on lots of different horses, you may want to wait on buying saddle and instead get some other accessories for her.  The first thing I got when I was a kid were a set of my own stirrups (so I didn't always have to adjust when I rode), and then when I got my first horse I got a saddle.  Boots, riding pants, a new helmet, a grooming kit, etc. may be better ideas for now. 




 Ohhhhh my.  To have the money to build something like that!  And those Friesians!   









 Your horse has such great ears!  Cute and tippy. 




 I wish I had seen this thread earlier!  Here are mine:

Tudor Oak's The Real Deal aka "Rillo" http://i.imgur.com/TVTI0.jpg
and his mom, Baby Ruth MHF aka "Baby" http://i.imgur.com/jFVcm.jpg 




 Please don't shut this down!  I haven't even noticed the trolls you are talking about.  Let one of us (perhaps me) mod it.  Like Nymera says, there are trolls everywhere, and in every subreddit.   




 My trainer always likes to say that your toes should be behind the girth, no matter what gait you are performing, though the ear/hip/heel rule is a bit different for Saddleseat, since it is acceptable to have your lower leg farther forward.  This is especially true when riding a Saddlebred at the slowgait or rack, since it is often helpful to push your feet forward a bit (though it depends on the horse). 

Some of the best info I can give you are photos.  Here are pictures of this year's Senior Saddleseat Equitation World Champion.  The first picture is her "down" in her post, the rest are her "up" in her post.  Now, this is an equitation rider, so she is being judged solely on her position and control of the horse.  When I ride, my equitation isn't bad, but my legs aren't so far under me.  Sorry for the long urls.

Down in my post (my heels could be more down) http://i.imgur.com/P3nbi.jpg

Up in my post http://i.imgur.com/3p2Gu.jpg (again, more weight should be in my heels)

Hope this helps a bit!  Above all, don't ride like this!!!  http://www.uphaonline.com/images/2010%20awards/lamborghini-in-black.jpg (phenomenal horse, but terrible leg position!)
 




 I can't help you out with a date, but I would like to commend you for also using the word "pineapple" in your username! 




 I will always, ALWAYS upvote this, mostly because my boyfriend is a spitting image.  Grrrrowwwlllllllll. 




 Can you post a picture of his entire body so we can see his socks?  It would give him a better shot at being ID'd.  I have people I can send his photo and info to, but I know they'll want to see all his markings. 




 I haven't encountered another mix like this in person, but some people are beginning to intentionally breed them.  They call them "Spangold Retrievers" (which is an *incredibly* stupid name), but you can get one on the internet!  http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/s/spangoldretriever.htm 




 Best ever!  Whenever I got to Europe, I stock up :) 




 I am by no means a "professional", but I have a nice camera, and have done things like equine photography and senior photos for people.  I think I could make it work. 




 Bart is darling!  And yes, where the heck to you ride?  Magical Acres???  It's beautiful!

Also, non-jumper person question: What exactly are the ear nets used for?  I see them on jumpers all the time, but we don't use them in my discipline.   




 oh yeah, rub that dirt right in to all the WHITE spots.  :) 




 Apollo is a Springer Spaniel/Golden Retriever cross.  We got him from the pound when he was a pup. 




 She is so cute!  I'm guessing she doesn't have the spaniel in her though, because her ears are way smaller and without curly hair.  I think black lab/golden is spot on.  Mutts are the best! 




 This is my dog!  He is from the pound also, and is a springer spaniel/golden retriever cross.  How big is your dog?  Apollo here is about 65 lbs. 














 Is this the one where we have to be from Canada?  I'll gladly participate, but I am in the U.S. 




 I don't know who this is, but I want one. 




 Wow, beautiful!  And I love your coat. :) 




 I came here because I KNEW he would be on the frontpage.  A ladyboner for sure! 




 This should get xposted on r/ladyboners.  We love a good beard over there. 




 This should get xposted on r/ladyboners.  Hellooooooooooooo OP. 




 This is a cute picture, but does not accurately convey his hotness.  Let's try this one!  http://28.media.tumblr.com/6imY2Ibivosygedu4nGXPYRxo1_500.jpg

Also this one is more recent: http://www.baltimoresun.com/media/photo/2011-01/58991602.jpg 









 Well whoever told you to post this here was correct!  Hot hotness!  And I concur with Januarys_Own -- may we see more? 




 He is super sexy, and when he rolls up his sleeves and kneads fondant...oooooooooo...

Have you seen the video of him playing guitar and singing?  Extra hot. 









 I just meant that I don't know who this is, or who the other out of focus people are.  I'm not a pop-culture queen, so this could totally be a famous person and I would have no idea.  Regardless, he's very easy on the eyes. :) 




 I don't really know what I'm looking at, but I like it! 




 Oh my. 




 ...wanna rip that moustache right off him.  Rawr. 




 Sweet jeebus, did you see this photo?  http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-SPKGl9Ae9N0/TkKkb3sZf6I/AAAAAAAAAxo/dbFhc8uBHxw/s1600/mateus+verdelho4.jpg 




 Thanks!  And yes, that is indeed me in the saddle.  :) 




 Oh my.  Yes! 




 This is a hunter pleasure class (the way Morgans do it).  This particular division was the Ladies Amateur Hunter Pleasure World Championship.  And yes, here are some pictures of him "au natural".  He loves to play in the snow. :)  1) http://i.imgur.com/bbXAq.jpg  2) http://i.imgur.com/zQ7nj.jpg  3) http://i.imgur.com/V5TBh.png

He goes home today and will begin the first day of his winter vacation tomorrow.  No shoes, no haircuts, and lots of time outside to run and play and roll in everything!  He loves to go to shows and loves to work, but I think he's ready for a break!!!   




 Muppet dog! 




 As the owner of a different dog named Apollo, I approve!  He looks snuggly! 




 Why does Iceland have to be so far away from where I live? 









 My GOD.  You are beautiful!  And wearing plaid!  And I'll be you have nice forearms too.  That's the test_subject773 trifecta right there. 
























 Love for the rest of him too!  That stubble...ooooh. 




 Maybe he feels FAB-uloussssssss!!!!!!  My horse is kind of metro -- he can totally rock a pink saddle pad, and he likes having his hair done. 




 Alright, some ideas (some of which are already names of other horses that exist in other breeds, but it shouldn't matter).  Though I do like Legolas!

Stand and Deliver,
Gestalt (yes, I'm a design nerd),
Instant Karma,
Out of Bounds,
Night Out,
No Inhibitions,
Bada Bing,
Outspoken,
Fight Song,
Own the Night,
Chill Factor,
Floored,
Unapologetic,
Once Again,
By Invitation Only,
Alliteration,
To the Nines,
Enthusiastic,
Slow Burn,
Art in Motion,
Shoot the Moon,
Thrill a Minute,
High Definition,
Bold Moves,
Artful Move.

As you can see, I have SO many ideas.  If you want me to run with a theme, word, idea, etc, let me know!
 




 OHHHHHH He's a Saddlebred!  No wonder I love him so much, I've been riding Saddlebreds for years.  Now that I look at him again, I can see it in his face.  Well, I'll think of some names!

And yes, it does look like he would have flunked out of "Saddlebred School" due to his movement, but what so many people don't realize is that Saddlebreds make great dressage, endurance, eventing, jumping, trail, EVERYTHING horses.  They may be the peacocks of the show ring, but they should be recognized as the peacocks of MANY show rings!  And he certainly won't have trouble flexing and putting his head in a nice spot for dressage.  I'm glad he found a home with you, he's going to have so much fun learning dressage! 




 What are the names of his sire/dam?  Sometimes that's a good way to name.  And what breed?  What do you intend to do with him?  Dressage?  This information must be known to achieve a truly kickass name. :)

Also, HE IS GORGEOUS!!!  He is soooooo floaty and beautiful!   




 I knew I loved tapirs, but now I know why. 









 YES.  Just...yesssssssssssssssssss.
 




 Thanks for the well wishes.  She's actually doing really well, and I rode her a bit today!   




 You are both my heroes. 




 YOU get an upvote because you love forearms and, according to your username, HORSES!  I also love both these things.  I have two horses, I also have two forearms.  This cannot be coincidental. 




 We use Markell Insurance for both our horses.  Check it out at http://www.markelinsurance.com/Products/Farm/Pages/PrivateHorseOwnerLiability.aspx

I couldn't tell you off the top of my head what we pay for the insurance, but I know it varies depending on how much coverage you need, i.e. what your horse is "worth".  That depends on show record, age, etc.   They have good medical coverage, but now my mare has issues being covered on ANY equine insurance because of laminitis issues.  




 Great picture!  I'm there right now.  Last day in Venice today after living here for 6 weeks.  Sad day. :( 









 You are very, very unalone!  I crush on him all the time when I watch The IT Crowd. 









 I agree, Toalmaster is far more lady-bonerific than Channing Tatum. 




 You, rulefollower, are not only apparently an upstanding citizen, but also a very attractive man!  This should make it over to r/ladyboners. 




 I show Morgans, so I switch between huntseat (flat) and saddleseat, but I also do quite a bit of driving!   




 Oh my, yes.  There are so many things right with this picture. 




 No, you don't get to go in there, you're just outside the pens.  However, this is still close enough that I have been licked by a wolf and bit in the butt by and ostrich.  




 I would kill to see what you will do with mine.  I hope you find it in all these comments.   




 Check out http://www.volunteermatch.org/. You can search by your location and interests.  It's a pretty great site, and I've found some good things through their search.  Also, volunteering at Como Park is pretty fun -- I was on the grounds crew for a while, and planted and weeded by all the animal exhibits.  The giraffes totally loved me. :) 














 It's not in Hyde Park, but when I was in London I went riding at Wimbledon Village Stables.  My mom and I both rode and had a great experience.  They are proximate to a huge and beautiful park, with lots of wooded paths for hacking.  We got to canter through the forest on some nicely trained horses.  Also, it wasn't anywhere near $150.  We had a guide, and it was just the three of us (the guide, my mom, and I).  So we rode very much for our experience level.  Check them out!  If you can't find anything for Hyde Park, try them instead.  They are a short (20 min) train ride from London.  http://www.wvstables.com/ 




 I remember always feeling bad for the kids with Rose Art crayons.  I was a very aware kindergartner.   




 I have Ariat Terrians http://www.ariat.com/English/Women/Footwear/EnduranceBoots/Terrain.html?color=SUNSHINE  They are incredibly comfortable, and have had the pair I'm currently using for 6+ years.  I wear them outside of the barn quite a bit too. :)  They are casual looking, so I suppose that has to be ok for you and your needs, but myself and my trainers all have these boots and love them. 




 Nice to know there's more than one of us on Reddit. :D  Though I'm primarily a Morgan rider, but dabble in Saddlebreds and Hackneys. 




 Awww yeah, and I don't even like cats!  Change that cat to a puppy and I'll need to change my undies. 




 I also demand more photos!  What a gorgeous horse! 




 Oh same.  We should have a St. Olaf subreddit for funsies.  Though I doubt it would be very active. 




 This scene was filmed at my college.  I had class in that lecture hall! 




 I see your pony and I raise you me (5'3") on a SMALLER pony!

http://i.imgur.com/SoLVO.jpg

 




 I would snuggle the crap out of him.  And then make out with him copiously.  :) 




 I ride west of Schamburg in Marengo at Merriehill Farm.  It's about 45 minutes from you, and SO worth it!  They breed and train wonderful Morgan horses!  They do all seats there, and have a beautiful facility.  Lessons are $30, and I think you can do a package deal.  Also, they are wonderful people, and the trainer, Jess is the best!  They have an excellent string of lesson horses for all abilities. Give them a call!  http://merriehillfarm.com/ (watch the video!) 




 I want one.  Preferably in that tree. 




 I want a dapple grey Morgan park horse.  Of course, since there are under 500 registered grey Morgans, and most of those come from more western bloodlines, this may be impossible.  But hey, a girl can dream!  So...like this, but grey... :)  http://morganhorseauction.com/images//2009/CenterpieceREF.jpg 




 I want to snuggle him!!! 




 There is a movie with Robert Urich from the 90's called A Horse for Danny.  You can buy it crazy cheap on Amazon.  http://www.amazon.com/Horse-Danny-Leelee-Sobieski/dp/B000A1IL8M/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1330539605 sr=8-1  It is my favorite horse movie!  As a child, I was obsessed -- I think I wore out the copy they had at the video store, and my mom finally got me my own VHS of it. 

As far as books, Walter Farley's "Man O' War" is great, even as I grow older, and there is a biography of Cigar called "Cigar: America's Horse" that is very well done.   




 I don't, but I'd love to try!  Also, yay for ASBs!
 




 She is darling! 




 Have you videoed her yet?  I've found that when I see a horse for sale, even if there is a picture of them in motion, I have to see a video to really see how the horse moves.  So I would say a) a video of her doing her thing (jumping, trotting, etc) and then a video.  If it costs too much to list with a video on Dreamhorse, put the video on YouTube and link to it in her listing.   




 Want.  To.  Exist... 




 What a fabulous horse!  What is he? 




 Arab was my second guess!  That or Morab.  The stubborn ones are always lovable. :)  Do you still ride Arabs? 




 Are you riding a Morgan? Looks Morgan-y to me.  SUPER CUTE!!!! 




 Her sister in law has mad skills! 









 Awesome man!  As someone who has had 15 teeth pulled out of their mouth to make things right, I know how awesome your victory feels! 




 Eeeeee!  I give him an 11 out of 10! 




 See, when I was a kid I thought he was a chicken nugget with a face and a tie, I didn't know he was supposed to be a wrinkly old guy.  When I found out he was a real person it blew my mind. 




 She is cute, but also beeeeeyooootiful!  Welsh pony? 




 You could certainly drive in your arena, and learning to drive is part of the fun.  I'm sure someone could show you the ropes! 




 Hot man, cute dog!  And I love your bedsheets!  They are so pretty. 




 If you can't ride, could you drive?  I'm not sure if either of your horses know how to drive, and I wouldn't suggest trying to train them to do it yourself, but if a knowledgeable person can start them in harness locally, I'd bet they'd take to it quickly.  Driving can really help with your riding too, since you have to communicate through your hands and voice, and it gives you a great "feel" for a horse's mouth. 
























 This would be a legitimately awesome remake. 




 Ahhhh my face hurts! 




 Upvote not only for a good idea, but for a horticultural username! 




 Ooo!  Details please!   I dream of such a meeting. 




 Beautiful color!  What do you guys do together? 




 I need to photoshop a fake book cover for this title. My horse trainer is obsessed with those books too, so she would die laughing!
 




 I must tell her this!  She looks no where near her age, and I think it's awesome.  I hope I have those genes! 




 Oh dear God. 




 Awwwww...that is so cute!  I'll have to see if my horse likes strawberries, I never thought to give him those.  He's a carrot man all the way. 




 Oof, I will not.  He's a gelding, so he'd probably get really sexually frustrated. 




 She will love you for saying that. :) 




 Reddit ALL THE PONIES!   




 Now I have to look that up.  I've never heard it.  Maybe it'll be my horse's new jam.  Right now he's really into LMFAO's "Party Rock Anthem" (seriously, he boogies to it). 




 Of course!  I'm sure they love you too, especially my horse -- he loves EVERYONE.   




 Cute!  Horses are much more "tuned in" to what is going on than people think.   




 I see a Halloween costume in his future... 




 I try to spend a lot of time with him in his stall at horse shows so he doesn't get bored.  My mom and I were hanging out in there and talking about when our friends were riding later in the day, so she pulled the horse show schedule out of her purse and started to look over it.  He came over and stuck his face right in it and was like, "what is that!?!?!?!".  She laughed and she started "showing" him which competitions our friends were in and when they would happen.  Usually he is very busy and squirms all over, but he just stood there staring and listening and wanted her to talk more.  Really, he loves attention, so he likes lots of things: stories, toys, going for walks, neck scratches, etc.  He just likes to be with people. :) 









 That face...I know it all too well. 




 Take my upvote!  For I, too, have a dog named Apollo.  http://i.imgur.com/1E77X.jpg 




 Puppy = pony.  Socks = legwraps.  But really though, AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW! 









 How is this not on the front page?  This is the epitome of AWWWWWW. 




 Upvotes for rats!   




 OH the ears!  The ears are too cute! 




 I see countless ads advertising a horse that is a "3 year old philly".  Like the cream cheese? 









 He is perfect!  And I love his facial hair. :)
 




 Dear God, she's only 9 and she's already cooler than I will ever be. 




 I still have my old iBook G4, which I would loan you happily, but it's 8 or 9 years old, and not exactly the sleek wonder that my MacBook Pro is.  It does, however, show how well these computers age.  I only had to get a new computer because the G4 couldn't handle some of the software I needed for grad school.   




 Mr. Tastee was my favorite, and am still, to this day, fascinated by the mystery man in the swirly head.  Even my username is inspired by him!  Was the guy that played Tastee also in other roles on the show?  Or did he only play that one character?  I've always wondered what he looked like, but I'm not sure if seeing the face of Tastee would make my childhood or ruin it.  

Also, do you know why season three of Pete and Pete never got released on DVD?  Where seasons 1 and 2 not selling as well as they had hoped?  Seems like there are a lot of Redditors...errr...people who would rush out to buy season 3.

Edit:  Just found [this](http://www.redbubble.com/people/meganlara/works/8098367-mr-tastees-blue-tornado-bars) online.  Commence purchasing. 




 Whoever made this suggestion was CORRECT!  Nice foreguns. :) 




 He really is.  It's too bad, because that subreddit has more followers, and is updated more often.  I still check it out, but just can't post.  Does anyone know if there's something you can do about mods like that?  Is there any sort of place where you can say, "this mod is out of control?"  I feel like so many people are treated unfairly by him.  If you look at his comment history it can be downright cruel.  I'd love to report his actions, but don't know who to contact. 




 Wishing a speedy recovery to your boy!  My horse has a talent for banging himself up doing normal things (lunging, trying to take his blanket off, being turned out), so I know the fear when you get that call. 




 AH HAHAHAHA!  This is hilarious.  Now I'm mad at myself for not taking a picture like this.  So many missed opportunities.

Yeah, you guys are right about the mod on r/horses.  I got banned because I asked him to rephrase one of the subreddit's rules (it was poorly worded and people would get confused and inadvertantly violate it).  Let's make it a better party over here on r/Equestrian! 




 Is it one by Adam Turman?  He has this one: http://adamturman.blogspot.com/2008/04/new-stuff-march-08.html 




 She is so beautiful!  That's pretty unusual to have blue eyes surrounded by dark skin/hair, isn't it?   




 You are very attractive (even though you have the toots). 




 And people say dogs can't smile. :)  Too cute!!! 




 Please fix the rule then about for sale items.  It currently reads: "All items, services for sale and blog articles should be posted in the proper reddit post linked to from the right sidebar."  There is no "for sale" category on the sidebar.  In fact, there are not categories at all on the sidebar.  Just make the rule "no items/horses for sale". 




 Hehe...Dennis Hopper. 









 Are you familiar with the phenomenon of "visual snow"?  If so, do you think this is something that will be researched and potentially cured, or since it is benign, do you think I'll just have to live with it forever?  I've had it all my life, and it makes my night vision poor to the point that I sometimes wonder if I should have a restricted driver's license.    




 I work with Morgans.  As for tapping the back legs, we don't ask them to move the back legs, simply move the front ones and stretch out their back legs.  If you mare moves her front legs forward, and the centers the weight of her body on her front legs, her back legs will stretch out.  I don't think Morgans park out differently than TWHs, do they?  Here is a parked out Morgan:http://randstables.com/files/2012/02/BoogieNE.jpg

You can see that he is putting most of his weight on his front legs. 




 The way my trainers have done it in the past is through patience and repetition.  First you have to teach her how to do it in hand, and then you can move up to doing it under saddle (for the line-up).  Halter your mare and take her out.  You could even do it in cross ties if you want, to make your life easier.  Take a whip, or even the handle of a broom, and gently tap on the back of one of her front legs, saying "down".  "Down" will be your command for parking out.  Then when she moves her foot, lots of praise!!!  Now do the other one, saying "down".  More praise!!!!!!!  Carrots!!!!!  Sometimes horses have problems lining their feet up straight when they are learning to park out.  I've seen my trainers grab the top of the horse's withers and rock them back and forth, to unbalance the horse just a bit and get them to square up their feet.  

Once she does it on the ground with you saying "down", and maybe just tapping a tiny bit or not at all, try it under saddle.  Find a long whip and pretend like you are in the lineup at a show.  Tell her "down", and lean over to tap her legs with the whip.  She'll probably put two and two together after a few tries.  In a show, you won't want to tap her legs with the whip, but you can tap her on the shoulder and tell her "down", and that is a refinement of the command.  Most of our horses park out when they are told "down", and many of them park out automatically when they come into the middle of the ring to stand.  

I hope this makes sense and I hope it helps!  It should be a fun exercise for you and your mare -- you get to learn together!  Good luck, and let me know if you have any more questions.
 




 Classes at breed shows get big and it's often important to stand out.  The judge may love your horse, but if your horse doesn't have distinctive markings you may get lots in a sea of navy hunt coats!  I show my Morgan in the Hunter Pleasure division, and have one light green coat and one tan/gold coat.  I wear them with dark shirts, and wear the tan coat with dark brown breeches.  I also wear a conservative belt, and sparkly stock pins and number pins.  Some bling is totally ok!  It would look crazy in the H/J circuit, but at a breed show it's very typical.  For reference, here are a few photos to give you an idea:

Tan coat on my gelding: http://i.imgur.com/mDkbs.jpg
Green coat on my mare: http://i.imgur.com/DwQf9.jpg
Green coat on my gelding (a bit washed out by the flash): http://i.imgur.com/fs8Fh.jpg

Hope this helps, and may you have blue ribbon rides!


 




 What is he crossed with?  He looks like a purebred Morgan to me! 




 This needs to go on my wall!
 




 I'm here for you in this difficult time. 




 I love plants, so I've volunteered at the Como Conservatory in St. Paul, and I now work at Noerenberg Gardens.  While I have a paid position, many people there are volunteers.  

Also, go to volunteermatch.org.  You can search for volunteer positions by interest and location.  It's pretty awesome. 




 My boyfriend and I have lived in Minnetonka for a few years and love it.  You're right, there ARE lots of great trails and parks here.  We take out dog all sorts of places and go hiking and swimming.  I'll have to look up some details for you as far as things to do, but there is no shortage!  PM me if you like.  Maybe we can meet up sometime. 




 Double the sodium! 




 Haha, the saddle *does* have some shape to it.  It's not like my saddleseat saddle!  Here is a picture of a Wotan, though I feel like mine may be a bit more shallow.  It's a great saddle if you're looking for an all-purpose close contact type.  http://www.countrytack.com/used_saddles/wotan_left.JPG 




 I personally have a Stubben Wotan I bought off ebay.  It was only $350, and in amazing condition.  Not sure what you like as far as cushion/support, but I love the Wotan because there is no padding on the seat or knee roll areas, and the knee roll is very small.  Also, the saddle is fairly flat, which fits my horse well and is what I like to ride in, but won't work if your horse has high withers.  

Maybe you like a squishy saddle...if you do, the Wotan is NOT for you, but I do love mine!   :)  Also, I use it for riding at home and showing, and it is a great all around saddle.   




 HECK YES!  My friend and I were watching this one day now that we are older, and agree that he is dreamy (especially in the 3rd movie) even though is a cartoon dog.   




 I had that one!  Now I want to know where it is.  Personally, I still use my Power Rangers insulated lunch box at work (I'm 26).  Also, your username is wonderful and I envy it.   
























 *sigh*...want. 




 Sadly I think he's too old.  I think they have an age limit for interns.  What I think I really need to find is someone who owns one privately, in a car collection or something.  Where to find that, I do not know. 




 Oh, hold me! 




 What glorious moss!!! 




 This professor is my adviser for my Master's thesis.  Today he told me that his lifelong dream was to drive the Oscar Meyer Wienermobile.  At the end of the semester, it is typical to give your adviser some sort of thank you gift (bottle of whine, gift card for a dinner out, etc). I say, screw the bottle of wine, I want him to be able to drive the Weinermobile!

Anyone know someone who has driven one, works for Oscar Meyer, etc?  Any leads would be great. 




 That's a pair of winners right there, sir. 




 I...love. 




 Why does it need to be a board game?  Isn't Apples to Apples just a card game as well? 




 It's only my best guess, but someone had to try it. 




 YO DE LAY HE, YO DE LAY HE, YO DE LAY HE YOOOOOOOOOO... 




 Who is it?  I want one!
 









 Hello fellow gardeners!  My boyfriend and I have a Minnesota garden, so while you're probably a bit colder than us, things are similar.  

1) This article is short and has a nice graphic showing which things to rotate from year to year, and how to make a rotational schedule.  As for things to plant next to each other, we don't have a ton of space, so we do things like grow beans up our sunflowers, and grow lettuce under our bean trellis.  We stage a lot of things such that by the time the larger plant leafs out and shades the smaller, earlier growing plan, the smaller plant is done producing.  As for things to plant, Charentais melons were small, and FANTASTICALLY tasty (seeds can be hard to find, but PM me and could mail you some we saved), and we had an amazing crop of tomatillos last year, which is great if you want to make a green salsa.  Another fun one that I haven't personally tried, but is good for our climate is the arctic kiwi.

2) We start tomatoes, peppers, zucchini, basil, and some greens indoors, though we start the greens indoors so we can have lettuce and kale early.  We also start another round of greens outdoors.  As for timing, SproutRobot is a nice tool.  You simply enter your zip code and it makes up a schedule for you, and can even send you email reminders and ship you seed, if you so choose.  http://sproutrobot.com/

3) We have gotten all our seeds from Baker Creek Heirloom Seeds and Seed Savers Exchange.  Now we don't buy seeds unless we want to try something new, because we have gotten good at seed saving, and our stock gives us more than enough seed.

4) We have raspberries that were in the yard when we bought the house.  Again, see the arctic kiwi.  As for fruit trees, you could graft some or buy some, but you're looking at about 5 years for them to start producing, so if you plan on moving, you may want to just wait.  Also, while it isn't really a "fruit" per se, we do a lot with rhubarb.

5)  Straw for mulch can be good, but we tried it one year and it seeded everywhere, which was super annoying.  We collect leaves from parts of our yard (and mulch the rest into the grass) and dump it all over the garden in fall.  Then in spring, we turn the leaves into the soil.  We also empty two compost bins full into the garden each year.  Our soil is very sandy, so we are working hard to get organic matter into the soil, and I'm not a soil amendment expert yet.  As for mulching to control weeds, when you mow your lawn, collect some of the clippings and use them as mulch in the garden.  We've had good luck with that.

6) If you have (or can find) an old window, it's easy to build a cold frame, and that can extend your season on either end by a few weeks.  Habitat for Humanity has ReStores where you can buy used and salvaged construction materials, and that might be a good place to look.  If you're looking for a good book that covers a lot of this stuff, The Backyard Homestead is fantastic.  

Hope this helps!!!  PM me if you need melon seeds! 




 More like DAT ALL OF HIM.  *grrrrrowlllll* 




 Cool!  What program(s) did you use for this? 




 I think a TC book club is wonderful!  I can't guarantee I'll be very available until May (I'm in the middle of my master's thesis), but I'm very interested in being involved.  I could plan meetings and find locations too.

I drive a lot, so I mostly listen to audiobooks these days.  Any books I sit down and read are for my thesis.  I work my way though a lot of young adult fiction, mostly because it's easy to follow while driving around the city.  I'm just working my way through N.D. Wilson's 100 Cupboards trilogy.  As far as adult fiction, I was an undergraduate English lit major, so I have a solid handle on that too. :)

I'll join this sub so I can stay connected.  I'd love to be a part of it.   




 The blue shirt with the sleeves rolled up...with the forearms...oh my. 




 What do you think about climate change?  Have you noticed changes in your lifetime that have shocked you?  How things looked when you grew up vs. now?  I'm doing my thesis on climate change and its impact on sense of place. 




 This was the stuff of nightmares in gym class.  The racquets were terrible. 




 I show in the Morgan circuit.  I started with Morgans as a kid, when I became interested in horses and a girl at school invited me over to her house to meet her horses, which were all Morgans.  From there, her mother directed my family to a nearby Morgan farm that gave lessons.  15 years later I'm still at the same barn!  I've also shown Saddlebred and Hackneys, but Morgans will always be my first love.  

It's hard to explain why I love Morgans so much more, but I feel like they have a certain spark to them.  So many of them have undeniable heart, and HUGE motors!  With both of my horses, you only have to say "whoa", never "go"!  They bring 110% to every ride.  Also, Morgans are smart -- sometimes too smart!  And of course they are beautiful!  As long as you don't need a big horse, they are the total package.   




 I'm so happy to know this is a thing!  I've tried to describe it to others as "being able to vibrate my eardrums", but now I really know what is going on in there! 




 Am I the only one attracted to OP?  Maybe minus the colander.   




 I miss Albert Heijn on a daily basis. 




 Can we clone him?
 




 There is a couple down the street that has horses on their property and regularly rides them around the neighborhood and adjacent parks. I would love to get to know them, and their horses, and see if they ever need help around their small barn when they are out of town, etc. What is the best way to go about introducing yourself? I don't want to just show up on their property -- that might be seen as trespassing. What do you suggest? Have you had people approach you on your land about your horses? How did they do it? And how did it make you feel?  I board my horses, so I don't have a good feel for what its like when someone approaches you about your horses on your own land. 




 For me it all began when a new girl came to my school in 4th grade.  She and I hit it off and she invited me to her horse show that weekend to meet her horse and watch her ride.  I'd never been to a horse show before, and was only familiar with western and jumping when it came to riding, but she had a Saddlebred and showed saddleseat, and I was instantly in love.  The following year, another girl joined our class who rode huntseat and had Morgans.  I really fell in love with her Morgan, and when I figured out that Morgans could do saddleseat, I pursued it.  My parents contacted a local trainer, and I'm still with him and his team of trainers 15 years later.  

I got my first horse when I was 14 and showed her as a saddleseat horse, but it turned out she wasn't really built for saddleseat and didn't enjoy it.  Not wanting to push her, we retired and bred her.  After she had her foal (my current show horse) we put her back to work and discovered she made a gorgeous hunter pleasure horse, so back to the show ring we went!  After a few years she retired for good and her son stepped up as my show partner.

In short, I've ridden and shown saddleseat, huntseat, and done driving with Morgans, Saddlebreds, and Hackney ponies for the past 15 years, and dabbled in bits of Dressage and Western.  At some point I would like to learn to jump!  Pictures here of my early saddleseat days (http://i.imgur.com/TQgw8.jpg), my mare as a hunter (http://i.imgur.com/jFVcm.jpg), her son as my current hunter (http://i.imgur.com/TVTI0.jpg) and one of the Hackneys I have shown in harness (http://i.imgur.com/Bl7yc.jpg)  Enjoy! 




 This week I am showing at the Grand National and World Championship Morgan Horse Show, and you can watch it live online!  This is a great opportunity to see some of the best Morgan horses in the world, and also to see some great saddleseat horses along with incredible hunter pleasure Morgans, and gorgeous western horses.  Comment if you have any questions about what you are watching!  

The show goes until this Saturday night and most of the "big" action will be happening in the Coliseum, so choose that feed from the options to the right of the video window.  Happy viewing! 









 Well I shouted it to the heavens on FB so that my Minneapolis friends will keep an eye out too.  I've been on your side of the music business before, and can't imagine losing everything you've had stolen. 




 I'll keep my eyes out as I'm around the neighborhood.  That seriously sucks, Ari.  I hope you can recover at least part of it.  Does your MacBook have any identifying marks on it?  Stickers/decals?  It would be easier to tell if someone using a suspicious MacBook. 




 I live in Minneapolis.  Not sure if you're coming anywhere near me, but if you are, my yard is your yard. 




 I had a Sudan Plated Lizard.  He lived for a long time, for a Sudan Plated, about 15 years.  He was always getting into trouble, like the time he got into the heating ducts. :) 




 I still have mine! 




 I want to hug him SO HARD. 




 Where are you located?  Are you able to grow all year, or does this merely extend your season.  I'm in MN, and our season is painfully short.  Cold frames only get us so far. 




 The amount of talent on Reddit (and in the world in general) never ceases to amaze me. 




 Really an amazing transformation.  You look fantastic! 




 He is everything I love in a man!  
 




 You went from poofy to ladyboner! 




 I'm looking for one extra ticket to the Sept. 29th Minneapolis Ben Folds Five show. Does anyone have one they can't use? There are some tickets left, but they are way in the back and I am a short, short person. PM me if you can help me out. Been a BFF fan since I was 15, and it would mean a lot to see these guys when they come to town. Many thanks!

 Can't see past the typo. 




 He's a keeper alright! 




 Where is it going to be located?  This is the first I've heard about it! 




 Now it's perfect.  And so dapper! 




 PIZZA-CORN! 




 Now he needs a monocle. 




 WANT!  Dammit and I was at the MN state fair too and didn't see these. 




 That will be an interesting look if she gets fat... 




 Nose Nachos is my personal favorite.  They should get rid of these hilarious names.  Hilarious names MAKE me want to try them.   




 I love this.  Now every time I use one of these I will imagine it saying "oooooeeeeeeeEEEEEE!!!!!" 




 Awesome! 




 Ohhhh...I had to come back to this one.  BAD TIME!  Riiiight... 




 SCIENCE!!! 




 It's a sugar rectangle, what's not to love? 




 You link doesn't work. :(  Just sends me to Google. 
























 The sliding rings clip to the headstall of the bridle.  The stationary rings are where the reins attach.  In my case, my top rein clips to the ring and the bottom rein runs through the ring and back to the saddle. 




 Wow, thank you!  That Bowman bit is the closest I've seen.  I'll send the link to my trainer and see if she'd like to get it. 




 I did look up Indian bits, but didn't find anything that similar.  :/

And as for the rust -- I'm sure that's part of it, but he really likes the fact that it's just a big straight bar and not jointed in any way.  If I could show him in it I would! 




 Hmm, I looked on ebay with no luck.  The Indian bits seem to be similar only because they have the extra rings.  I looked up thorn bits, but no dice there either -- many of them have crazy looking spiked ports.  The only one I've ever found close to it was in this bit collection on ebay:  http://i.imgur.com/ewAftSx.jpg  The third one down is very much the same, except with a slow twist instead of the ribs. I wish I could have afforded it. 




 My barn owns this bit and my horse is obsessed with it, as are many other horses in training.  It's his happy bit -- he works well in it, loves it, and we use it on him whenever its appropriate.  However, we only have one. My trainer pulled it out of some "big rusty bargain bin of bits" years ago and we have NO idea where to get another!  

Does anyone know what this kind of bit is called?  Has anyone ever seen one?  Do any of you own one?  It's a big 'ol mystery to us! 









 Well, just from this vector, I know I like you and would probably try to ask you out.  What does that say about good design?

 




 P.S. I was hoping you were a Redditor so I could tell you that!
 




 You are my hero!  Everyone I show the sign loves it.  My friends in Madison, my aunt in Atlanta, my mom in Illinois -- it's just the kind of humor we need when it's going to be this cold. 









 Uptown Theater, Minneapolis, MN.  They're a funny bunch. 









 Hello again friends, OP here.  Some of you have asked for a better description of her skills and so I've uploaded her resume for public viewing.  I did black out her name and address for now, so if anyone wants to contact her, simply PM me.  Again, many thanks to you all.  

https://www.dropbox.com/s/9cenx75tkrkwhko/JK_RESUME.pdf 




 Ladies and gents, my good friend finds herself without a job after this holiday season, and is having problems finding something new due to an odd looking resume.  In short -- after some medical issues took her out of the workplace for several years, she decided to become a horse trainer, which she did for several more years, until now.  Basically, she has an odd blank spot in her resume that employers don't like, and even after applying to 65+ jobs, has nothing to show for it.  

Preferences include some kind of receptionist/administrative assistant job, something in a law office, etc.  Really though, retail, sales, or whatever would work at this point.  Part time would be ok.  Things are going to get tough for her if she doesn't find anything soon and I don't know how else to help her than put the word out on here.

I can send a resume to anyone who is interested, or thinks their employer might be hiring.  She is smart and easy to like, and also hysterically funny.  If I could offer her a job I would, but I'm just not in that position right now.

Thanks Reddit, you're the best. 




 Single?  OP is a hottie.  Though, that dog does look pretty awesome.  I would go out with either of them.

 




 This is so sexy. 




 Why was she born in the fall?  I always associate baby animals with being born in the spring.  Or perhaps you're in Australia? 




 Forearms + glasses + beardface + farmer + excellent user name.  Yes please! 




 Not sure on the footing, but usually it's a mixture of tanbark and sand and dirt.  The green color is traditional for this show and is made from dying woodchips.  

So since this class is all about speed (while maintaining a correct frame) it's a combination of pushing your horse forward while bringing him back a bit to get him to collect.  For most of these ponies, they want to GO GO GO!  When I have shown them, you don't cluck much to move them on, you just stop telling them to slow down!  And you have to slow down in those tight corners as well, and lean into them so you don't flip the cart.  So yes, you can hear the driver's voice telling the pony to slow down, and then as they call for faster and faster speeds, she says less and just lets him fly! 

Conformation and manners also plays into the judging, as well as head carriage and correct motion of the gait.  I'd love to show one again -- so fun! 




 The first couple minutes is them walking to the ring -- which gets a bit long, but being with them as they charge down the ramp into the ring is incredible!  I've shown these ponies before, and they are an absolute delight. 









 Voted for Mr. Oliver! 




 I sponsored you!  All the best! 




 I made my eyes burn also.  Glad I'm not the only one. 




 So is that stuff basically made of cancer? 




 I had that cup! 




 This is why I only have pictures of my horse's nose! 




 My friends and I are still trying to figure out what the hell nipple blades are.  It's a fantastic card to play though.
 




 How in the world did he get up there? 




 This sounds like a fantastic idea.  I just graduated, so I'm not a rec member right now because I'm not currently paying student services fees, but I could get a membership.  As for the other side of the deal, I can teach you cooking no problem, and could also help with men's fashion!  If only I had access to a horse, I could teach you to ride too!  PM me and let's talk. 




 BAHAHAHAHAHAHA!  I feel like if I ever jumped my horse, this is how he would do it.   




 I even read that last bit in a sped up commercial announcer voice.  Uncanny sir. 




 Wow, quick response, and a good answer!  I had no idea so much went into it, though I'm not surprised it's so complex.  I am not a natural redhead, but I have heard about things related to redheads and anesthesia.  At the time I had both surgeries, I wasn't on any medications at all.  Though it is interesting that you mention Klonopin, because I've been taking that for the past couple years now.  If I need to go under again and am still on the Klonopin, maybe I'll be easier to handle. :) 




 How do you determine how much anesthesia to give a patient?  I've been put under twice, and they've commented both times about how hard I was to "knock out".  As in, I think they had to give me more anesthesia than they thought.  Does it have to do with a person's age?  Size?  I'm 27, female, and 120 lbs at 5'3".

Just wondering why I've been compared to "trying to take down a rhino."  Lol. 




 Love the Borlaug one!  I like to see him included in this grand company. 




 How awesome at biking do we need to be?  I just got a new bike that I've been riding every chance I get, but I'm still woefully out of shape, especially up hills.  Oh god, the hills. 




 What a total doll.  I wish my horse would chill out and do this, but he gets too excited and wiggles all over!   




 I too would like to know more about this meetup!
 




 So jealous of this barn/cabin! 




 I wanted to go for a hack too when I was in London and went here: http://www.wvstables.com/  It was FANTASTIC!  Absolutely top notch.  We rode out on the green and went cantering through a forest.  You also get to ride through town and they had horse crosswalks!  All the horses were well trained and in good shape, the trainers/owners were nice and knowledgeable.  Cannot recommend this place enough! 




 Watch the lip sync battle between John Krasinski and Jimmy Fallon.  First of all, hilarious.  Second of all, sexy.  It's about 8 minutes, but it's so worth it to watch the whole thing!

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EnsjrDsVyI 




 He is a complete doll!  I love his markings. 




 That sounds fantastic!  I've really been overwhelmed by the number of people who have reached out to me.  I feel so welcomed already!  I'm eager to get to know the city.  I really love places that are little holes in the wall, so maybe you can show me some lesser known, but still awesome places to eat, drink, and hang out.

I'll let you know when I hit town!

- Nicole 




 Thanks for dropping me a PM!  I'll let you know when I hit town.  I've honestly been overwhelmed by the number of responses I've gotten.  It would be great to meet up and swap Minneapolis stories!

- Nicole 




 Thanks for the quick reply!  It's nice to know that meeting people will be quite easy.  I am INCREDIBLY social, so I hope I'll find some quality people to hang out with soon after I move, assuming I even have time to do that!

If I have any questions I'll let you know.  I've already gotten a couple responses from my post and it hasn't even been an hour!  I think moving to Madison will be just fine, and it's nice to have Redditors on my side. :)

 




 Holy crap Dan, that was a fast reply!  I may indeed be up for dinner with your and your ladyfriend.  I'll be living in what I think is Near East (right by Olbrich).  I'm a very social person and like having a large group of friends that enjoy doing things on a fairly regular basis.  Generally, I'm up for most things.  Going out, staying in, having potlucks/grilling out, going to museums/concerts/.  

I bit about me, I suppose.  I'm a 27 year old female currently living in Minneapolis and finishing my Master's thesis in Landscape Architecture.  The job at Olbrich is just a stop-gap internship while I find work in a design firm.  That job may be in Madison (if I fall in love with the place and there is work), or I may be moving in the fall to one of the coasts in hopes of getting a job out there.  I will also be continuing my job for the University of Minnesota as the copyeditor of the Landscape Journal, which will keep me a bit busy, at least for the summer.

I really appreciate you writing back so quickly!  The next few weeks are going to be tough as I uproot myself from the safety of graduate school and the friends I have made over the last 9 years of living in Minneapolis.  However, as we all know, change is necessary, and I sincerely hope the best is yet to come in my life!

I'll be in touch,
    Nicole   




 Greetings Madison!

I'll be moving to your fine city in about a month.  This marks my terrifying transition from graduate school up here in Minneapolis to the "real world", where people are married, have babies, and don't have time for new friends.  I know a few folks in Madison, but they are all married, or insanely busy, or both.  No babies though...yet.

WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE?  Where should I go to meet up with some lovely, intelligent folks?  I see you have some bar meetups, and I plan on hanging out at coffeeshops, concerts, and the like, but how do you really meet people?  I'll be working at an internship at Olbrich Gardens, but as I'm the oldest intern by quite a few years, I don't think I'll be making many friends there with whom I would like to spend time outside of work.  

Anyways, let me know if you have some ideas.  PM me if you'd like to introduce yourself!  I'd love to get to know a few folks before I move, as this transition is proving to be particularly anxiety producing.  However, let it be known, I'm just coming out of a relationship and won't be looking for a "romantic connection" right off the bat.

See you all in a month! 




 Methinks this belongs on r/ladyboners. 




 That dress is gorgeous.  




 I currently live almost directly behind Matt's and have only been there twice in 9 years.  I think you're fine. :) 




 You should NOT be getting downvoted!  A helmet is a must for any beginning rider, and in my opinion, every rider.  15+ years of riding and I still wear one religiously.   




 Seeing him in concert in April!  I will have to resist pouncing him...
 




 This is AMAZING!  In the picture where you have the purple streak in your hair and are wearing the grey coat, you are ADORABLE.  I want to squeeze you!!!  Great work -- I cannot imagine how much courage it would take to become who you know you really are.  You look fantastic. 









 I would like to see what is behind the camera!  And of course, the forearms are tasty. 




 You are not alone.  My crush for 10+ years.  Oh Jason...
 
























 Scooter (left) is a 17.3 hand Saddlebred.  Rillo (right) is a 14.3 hand Morgan.  Also, I'm only 5'3".  Rillo and I enjoy being vertically challenged together in a barn of tall people riding Saddlebreds and Friesians. :) 









 It is Flying E!  They have such a nice facility.  My boy is digging it there, and everyone at the barn is in love with him! 




 A Morgan, actually.  In a barn of Saddlebreds and Fresians!  He's the smallest horse in the place, lol! 














 You're still laughing about it, and now I'm laughing about it too.  Fantastic!  Thanks for replying.  See you in Minneapolis on 10/29! 




 What is the most inappropriate thing you've ever laughed at?  Bonus points if it was in a situation where no one else thought it was funny.  I find myself laughing at inappropriate things often...in public.  Then the staring by innocent bystanders begins. 




 You are my hero. 









 It looks like Kim is getting a lovely shoulder rub. 




 Upvote for using the phrase "slab sided nerd."  Lol! 




 Doubly hot -- great forearms AND you were vacuuming! 




 I have multiple pairs for riding, and I also own their gardening and work gloves.  I love them!  They have a great feel, even when I'm using a double bridle, adjusting tack, etc.  And when they get gross you can just throw them in the wash with your barn clothes!  I have Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and they really help my hands, especially if the horse I'm riding is strong.  I can't recommend them enough! 




 Omg that last photo of him in his party hat with his tongue out is PRICELESS!  What a lucky horse he's been to have you for so long, and to have such a great life.  He looks great for 27!  Happy birthday to both of you, and tell him he doesn't look a day over 15! 




 I have a riding pair, and also a gardening pair and a work pair!  I swear by them and tell everyone I can about these gloves.  They have a great feel even when I'm riding in a double bridle, and when they get gross you can just throw them in the washing machine with your riding clothes!   














 So sorry about your loss.  She was a Morgan, right?  If so I know her breeder. 




 VERY true!  In this case you're right, I'm likely ok because it's obviously a brassica.  I normally wouldn't bother trying to eat something like this but there is such a large amount of it that it seems wasteful to not try! 









 Your dad sounds incredible!  I love that you still have coffee with him every Saturday morning.  I wish my dad was geographically closer to me so we could do that.   









 So jealous you got to meet him!  And is that Call Me Regal? 




 That's just the way the barn does it.  I don't own the barn, just ride there.  Most of the barns I have ridden at have shavings in the aisles unless the aisles are paved. 




 She's not thrilled about pastures.  Paces the fence, etc.  this is just how she's happy. :)

 




 Glowie is a 30 year old Morgan mare.  She sound of body except for some arthritis you would expect at her age, but is rather senile.  She has a stall but prefers not being in it, so the door is simply left open and she comes and goes as she pleases.  She wanders around the barn, the indoor arena, and around the farm grounds.  She is slow moving and never strays too far.  She is usually found napping, watching lessons, or raiding people's bags and purses for goodies. :)  It can be a shock to new visitors to just see her strolling around on a sunny day! 









 Tiny cute fuzzy environmentalist!  (the best kind) 




 Hah!  That's exactly why I don't like it! 




 Cushings is a tough thing.  It's great that Lenny has made it so long though!  I think Cushings is the one drawback about Morgans -- some of them just seem to be prone to it.  When we put Baby down she still looked pretty good, but was having problems moving around and walking comfortably.  Winter was on its way, so we made the decision to put her down before she got really bad.  Definitely do pictures with Lenny this summer, you'll treasure them forever!  We also had a bronze commissioned of Baby, and that is a very special thing to me. 




 I'm in MN too, so I seriously feel your pain!  And now this morning it's snowing again.  April fools?   




 Yep English.  I've done some Western at a very casual level, but I can't get used to the saddle!  There's just too much under my butt! 




 Saddleseat is fantastic and it's how I started out.  The two reins are just a double bridle, or full bridle.  They're used in lots of disciplines.  And lol about your horse running loose at shows.  My horses are all business about shows, but then are afraid of stupid stuff at home.  Rillo is deathly afraid of baby powder (even if it's on his butt), garden hoses, and COWS. 




 Actually none!  Baby's lines are here: http://www.allbreedpedigree.com/baby+ruth+mhf.  Rillo is her son, by Whispering Whamunition.  




 Baby started saddleseat but was then more comfortable as a hunter, so she became my first hunter pleasure horse.  Rillo was obviously built to be a hunter from the get-go so that is what he is too.  My 3-year old is now going to be my new saddleseat horse, probably English pleasure.  I go back and forth between seats all the time because I love them both! 




 Seriously!  Baby had abs, lol.  And Rillo is like riding a freight train even though he's not even 15 hands.   




 Nope, both Morgans :)   




 Thanks RonRonner!  We kept her happy and comfortable as long as we could.  She'd had IR problems since she was about 10, and I had to stop riding her about a year before we put her down at the age of only 16.  She had some problems keeping weight on, but never got too bad.  The farm and their staff is incredible, and I credit their expertise and diligent care when it comes to how long she stayed sound and happy.  She is buried on the farm, under the pasture where the new foals play. :) 




 Baby (the chestnut on the right) died a few months after this photo was taken from issues due to Cushings.  We did this photo shoot knowing she wouldn't be around for much longer.  I'm so glad I have this photo of the two of them!  Rillo (on the left) is her son and only offspring.  He is still my show horse. 









 Oh of course!  I know him.  Super cool horse! 




 He looks awesome!  What's his show name?   




 I deleted the first version of this because I messed up the link.  All fixed now!  Enjoy! 









 I didn't live in Melby, but had plenty of friends who did.  Yes, it's quiet, but you don't have to sneaking around.  Playing music in your room, talking with friends, watching a movie, etc. are all totally normal!  It's not freakishly quiet, don't worry.  Thorson is great too, and is a bit more boisterous, but not to the point where it's annoying.  

Just don't live in Rand.  Never, ever, live in Rand.  I lived there as a sophomore -- blech! 

Let me know if you have any more questions! 




 The barn I'm at now has 3 friesians, and I'm DYING to ride one!  




 He came to Minneapolis to speak and promote his book, so I went.  Got a free copy of his book, some great entrepreneurship advice, and an autograph! 




 I met him about a month ago and he was the NICEST guy.  Way taller than I realized (hotttttttttt), and genuinely interested in what I had to say.  I will marry him now please? 




 I just...I can't even function right now.  So good. 




 My horse hasn't had a lame day in his life, and my young colt has also had no issues at all thus far.  My mare, who we lost last year, did succumb to chronic laminitis.  This is probably the one "problem" Morgans have.  They are prone to laminitis, insulin resistance, and founder.  However, most Morgans I know were hale and hardy until their mid to late 20s.  They are indeed tough, while having beautiful refinement.  

As for ants in their pants -- I can really come down to breeding and training.  My horse can be rather fire-breathing, in the respect that he always wants to go as fast as possible!  I never really ask him to go forward, just to slow down.  When we do our extensions, I simply stop trying to slow his body and off we go!  So many Morgans I've ridden are like this -- go go GO!  But they do have great brains as well.  My gelding is often TOO smart for his own good.  He even has a full understanding of the music they play at our shows, and will try to transition into the next gait when he hears the key of the music change!

Well, when you rebuild your wallet, and if you want to look into a Morgan, you know where to find me on Reddit!  Depending on what part of the country you're in, there could be some really great opportunities.  Have you ever considered taking lessons at a Morgan barn just to try out their dressage abilities? 




 Morgans are great little dressage horses!  I have several friends who use their horses for dressage, and now Western dressage is becoming really popular as well.  If you want any Morgan dressage connections, PM me and I can get you in touch with the right folks.

Even though my horse competes in hunter pleasure, we do a lot of basic dressage exercises with him at home, especially now that we're trying to get him better with patterns.  He overthinks everything and jumps to conclusions!  The dressage work is slowing his brain down a bit. :)  Here's a pic of him doing his thing in the show ring because, well, who doesn't love more horse pictures? :)

http://i.imgur.com/TVTI0.jpg

http://i.imgur.com/fs8Fh.jpg 




 Thank you!  He's a Morgan. :) 




 Cool!  Also your horse is adorable and I want to squeeze his face and give him kisses. :) 




 Well, I'm not sure if this will clarify much (as reins just tend to look like a tangle), but here is my horse wearing the aforementioned rein configuration.  The bit he's wearing in this picture isn't the same one we're discussing here, but the reins are run in the same way.  Snaffle rein goes directly from hand to bit, and is clipped to the ring of the bit.  Curb rein goes from saddle, through bit ring, and doubles back.

http://imgur.com/PPwAtGI

Closer up:http://i.imgur.com/3YmYWU7.jpg

Hope that clears things up a little!

EDIT: the curb rein also goes through the martingale.  Forgot to say that! 




 Well I would certainly love to know what she called it!  That's been the main obstacle in searching, simply not knowing what it's called.  The closest I've come is a Four Ring Bolt Bit. 
























 It just raises so many questions.  What is it?  Why does it only have one arm?  What is that thing growing out of its head?  Why does that thing look evil?  Is that a bowtie on the side of it's head or an ear?  What drugs was the person on who made this? 









 These are wonderful!  Thank you for sharing. :) 




 I had to go the custom route thanks to having elf feet and Hulk calves.  I swear by Dehners.  They made me my boots for $900 and I've been wearing them for the last 10 years.  Really good product.  I got measured locally and then boots magically came!  They can tell you where to get measured near you.  http://dehner.com/ 




 Wonderful!  I love seeing other saddleseat folks on here. :) 




 Upvote for sexy forearms, AND upvote for the Cubs. :) 




 Since you don't do the processing afterwards, do the jars seal shut?  And how long to these keep?  Do you have to keep them refrigerated?  Sorry for all the questions but I tried to make pickles last hear and they were HORRIBLE, so I want to make awesome ones this year. :) 









 Turtrucken? 




 "In our constitution there are many rights: the right to housing, the right to education, the right to health. But I don't find the right to park." -  Enrique Pealosa, former mayor of Bogota, Colombia

People act like parking is some kind of right they have wherever they go, and if it isn't available there needs to be an "improvement." I, however, see removing parking as an improvement.

 He's adorable!  Does he have a notch in one ear? 




 Got one of these last season.  Roommate called it my "seasonal tramp stamp." 




 Upvote for the rabbit named Microwave.  




 I'm a 2008 alum too, and I'm considering moving from my current 2 bedroom.  Could you PM me some details about your property? 









 Best high horse picture ever!!! 




 My mom was cleaning out the pantry around Christmas and found a box of Ziploc baggies with the VR Troopers on them.  She is using them for EVERYTHING. 




 I find that if I eat solid food before I show it doesn't sit well -- enter Organic Valley single serve chocolate milk boxes!  They're like juice boxes but full of milk, and they don't have to be refrigerated!  The combination of protein and a bit of sugar and fat gets me through my ride.  After that I eat ANYTHING.   




 My trainer once forgot that I don't weigh much and threw me over the other side of the horse! 









 So much love!!! 




 There's one of these in my hometown that my dad helped build.  They're tearing it down soon and replacing it with something more "modern.". So sad. 




 I still have my Ninjor action figure.  




 Hi everyone.  I have a little side business called Bling for the Ring that sells vintage stock pins and lapel pins, offering riders something unique to accessorize with.  I sell primarily in the Morgan and Saddlebred world, since those are the breeds I show with, but would love to tap into the Hunter/Jumper, Dressage, and Arab worlds.  

Does anyone know of any message boards where I could post, facebook pages I could like, or any other ways to reach out to these disciplines/breeds?  I have an Etsy page and can ship internationally, so the sky's the limit!!!  

Any help would be great.  If you're curious about what I'm selling, my Etsy page is here: https://www.etsy.com/shop/blingforthering

Thank you all in advance! 









 What a beautiful girl, and what a long life!  Do you have any of her tail hair?  When my horse passed I got a necklace made of her tail hair braided together with some of her son's hair.  It is one of my most treasured possessions.  




 And now we are dating!  *swoons over /u/manifest_reverie* 




 Pita's cake is almost as cute as he is!
 




 Yes!!!  And now I even remember that theme music.  Now I want to watch it... 




 I'm dying to remember the name of the show with the two cats dressed in blue and red (left edge).  Does anyone remember?  I recall loving that show. 




 Rhinoceros pin?  Interesting... the 90's were a special time. 




 This is awesome!  Thank you! 




 I "awwww"ed out loud! 




 Hair ribbons have been claimed.  Thank you! 




 I've has these forever and never used them.  My mom got them before she realized they weren't used in saddleseat.  One is black, one is forest green, and one is navy.  I'll gladly mail them to whoever might be able to use them!  I just feel bad throwing them out when they could be used.  Just PM me! 









 Amazing work!  And your fiance is a mega ladyboner. 









 Where in IL?  I'll be driving to Rockford. 









 Max is brave!  My horse thinks cows are going to kill him in his sleep or something. 




 I am crying tears because you have a fiancee.  :( 




 I'm more interested in the sign that appears to have a guy Irish stepdancing on it.
 




 I want to know about the Pegasus fabric!  What the hell is that? 




 My mom still does her Tae-Bo religiously.  In her defense, it's working.  She looks incredible for 66. 




 I always got stuck in that hamburger cop thing.  I don't know why, but I could never figure out how to get out of the part with the bars, and my mom would have to somehow pry me out. 




 I was just stuck in traffic.  Looks like they're off the highway now, but there's still a major gapers block.  Northbound is worse than southbound. 




 Bun Mi if he's into Vietnamese sandwiches.  They are crazy tasty. 




 From one pineapple-themed username to another, I salute you. 




 I miss when they used to actually stamp the date into the end of the can instead of printing it on, and then you could get the coveted end slice with the date on it.  Mmm...cranberry numbers. 




 That underground village shopping area is the stuff of nightmares.  I remember similar places like that from when I was a kid.  I still have a fear of places that are made to look like the outside but are inside.  Not sure if there's word for that phobia... 




 Wonderful, thank you!  Will you be going?  We could make it the world's smallest Reddit meetup.  :) 




 Any details on when and where?  I'm a historic preservation professional and I'd love to go. 









 The orange scent was my favorite too!  I used to scratch it really sparingly to save it. :). In fact...I still do. 




 Nope, Minnesota. 




 People do jump in there, so I think it's a pretty standard height. 




 I want to ride Buster!  I would look like a flea on a dog's back up there! 




 It's not oddly short, so it must be the angle and Scooter's giantness. :)
