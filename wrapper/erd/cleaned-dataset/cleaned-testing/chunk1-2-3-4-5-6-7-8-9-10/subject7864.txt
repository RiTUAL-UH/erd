 uhh... did no one see this youtube video!? is this real life? http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded v=-xNFiPoGePo 



















 do you game? if so, what are some of your favs? also a monster fan, love you dude. 


































 right in the feels 









 this is what happens when a pretty good-but not top school throws money to get the "best" in its company. if NYU wants to become the next Harvard (as J-sex's delusional puts it), it's going to have a tough time with PR nightmares like this 




 it is a great read. but of course if it's too long, just get a high res image of Bosch's "Garden of Earthly Delights" for basically the same content 




 The Inferno is just the first part of the Divine Comedy, which covers usury (obtaining wealth from a source other than natural resources or human activity) :) 









 hahahaha yes!

 I am an Econ major and it seems like everyone works for a start up at one point in their time at NYU. Big tech firms also like to recruit from NYU ( I will be at one upon graduation ). And getting an internship in NYC is like shooting fish in a barrel. 









 my b for the misinformation then! thanks for clearing it up 




 I think you need to be part of a women's CS society on campus but I remember reading this when I was a freshman.  




 I took 101 and it was a little hard but not crazy. As said before, he doesn't really teach. He's a cute guy though and you can definitely teach yourself all you need to know 




 it's one of the best in the country. if you graduate from it and are female, you are guaranteed an interview with Google, no lie. 




 maybe, but the number of "candid" pics of them is excessive. they're nice guys and all so maybe they don't care though 




 I'm convinced the zac and cody kids are behind it. It's a little TOO convenient that they're in every other post... 




 crocodile lounge gets you a free personal pizza with every drink 




 nailed it 
























 I can confirm this. She's a sweetheart and I'm glad the university was able to protect her privacy for the most part while she was there 




 haha good question. I wish I knew :(. I am skipping the ceremony either way. 




 that's so sad :( I hope it works out! in exchanges ya gotta pay it forward 









 Absolutely. There are multiple Pio Pio locations too. If you have a group, the Matador is a killer deal 




 I recently went there and it was delicious. The fresh sorbet is absolutely insane 




 This is the structure I encountered. Except that I took Latin American History with Jorge Castaneda which was pretty amazing. Those freshman seminars definitely pull in cool names / academic celebrities so take one while you can 




 it's set to private :( 




 it's largely been taken down but you can see bits of it in a video here: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/01/tyler-the-creator-racist-mountain-dew-commercial-pepsico_n_3193650.html?ir=Black+Voices  




 I always felt this way. I'm sure it's just the changing editors and what not (who for the record publish in other NYC based publications, so they have some credibility). I remember reading 'Local my senior year of high school so maybe it's just my anticipation to live in NYC fading. I miss the hyper active comment section though... no one comments on the new articles with is a bummer 
























 video games are highly addictive because they are psychologically gratifying--as in, you get immediate rewards and feedback constantly. to state that just because someone of one gender is immune to this mental response is unfortunately misplaced sexism. this means, if properly exposed, any girl can like games. So "hot or not" is on a case-by-case basis, just like it would be with any male gamer, which as it is easy to imagine represent all ends of the aesthetic spectrum.

edit: words 




 My Free Concert NY is amazing 




 do you mind if I ask what job function you had there? I've heard mixed things, but the name + getting a job right out of undergrad in these times isn't easy so I took it 




 thanks! money definitely isn't an issue and I plan to live solo 




 I'm going to be working at Amazon so I'm basically only looking around South Lake and Cap Hill. 




 thanks, you rock. My game plan is basically to fly out 4 - 5 days before I start work and schedule in a bunch of walk throughs for then. Is that an unreasonable time frame in seattle? I have relocation funds from my company + plenty of friends who I could crash with if I end up needing extra time. 




 I saw a gallatino essentially doing the econ CAS major minus the math courses. not hating but what's the point? 




 even though I don't need to move in until mid-July? it's that hard to find good stuff? 




 I know things move quickly in NYC--I've had friends here move to NYC and get an apartment in the same weekend. Is this the same in Seattle, or should I fly out substantially early to pick an apartment? 




 so long but worth the read 
























 Oh no--lots of cheese in there, it just melted when baked :) so good

 I want a picture of Slurms McKenzie from Futurama for my Facebook cover photo but unfortunately there aren't many available via Google Image Search. Would love any and all interpretations https://www.google.com/search?q=slurms+mckenzie um=1 ie=UTF-8 hl=en tbm=isch source=og sa=N tab=wi ei=IG_9UYPiE-P-igKjwYDIAQ biw=1366 bih=667 sei=I2_9UbP_Fu7jigL4_IDgDw 




 What is your end goal? Recent grad here. I found that the CAS degree was much more flexible (in terms of schedule and content) and honestly, unless you're trying to work at a snobby i-bank, top employers hiring for many business positions really don't care if you went to b-school or not.

 its the E3 update we deserve, but not the one we need right now 









 I know for a fact that he lives on St. Marks and Ave A. He goes out on that street ALL of the time. I have seen so many pics with him and talked to him a few times over beers and crepes. 
























 Do you still need a ticket?!
 




 I am looking for two Saturday tickets! I have Friday tickets, but I am a HUGE conner and would be super bummed to only go one day. I unfortunately lived 3000 miles away when I initially bought my ticket on a hunch I'd be back East by now...

Get me two Saturday tickets and I can throw you some swag I have leftover from my days working at Marvel. Or a carrot cake. Or some nice beer--your choice! 









 yes please! 









 he ate 4 sooooooooooooo 




 you can get them on Amazon, even with free shipping, in the US. My first batch of it accidentally yielded a really delicious ricotta.  




 I actually followed the instructions by this guy on youtube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWh2LS9WJIk 




 it was pretty delicious. It did take about an hour, but it is cost effective. I'm hoping once we've better at it that we can do it in 30 min, in which I think it's be worth the savings :) 




 Yeah I did! not sure if that's cheating or not but I also made a beef wellington this week and felt like being creative. they're pretty nifty to play around with 





























 it's a real sausage party in here 




 Thank you! My fridge could use some more Sounders swag though  




 It's delicious! I have to admit... The only sujuk I've had is the one I've made at home. 

The jist of it is it's a basic beef blend with red wine, garlic, paprika, etc but I think the flavor you're referring to is fenugreek! It's super yummy and is that X factor is sausages usually. 




 it's all good! sausage casings do usually come from intestines which is why they have that shape so you weren't wrong

also you gotta start somewhere but don't be scared! cooking can be a lot of fun :) 




 you know it! I actually only lived in Seattle for a year but it's still a near and dear place in my heart  




 Sausage making is 2 basic steps: meat grinding + casing!

To make this recipe, I ground a blend of short rib and round meat to get a 70/30 fat ratio.

Using some hog casings I bought online, I then stretched the casings over my kitckenaid sausage stuffer attachment and then stuffed the blended meat in there! 














 no whammies no whammies no whammies  





























 exactly how I felt :) 














 oh yum! I needed to use up some thyme but rosemary bread is the best 




 more or less this!: https://ginskitchen.wordpress.com/2013/05/22/rosemary-roasted-garlic-and-lemon-no-knead-bread-in-dutch-oven/ 









 it makes a lot :) I am just working on my plating skills here so I'm happy to hear it looks alright!

 I'd do a lot of the same things I'd do with a duck, it being a fatty bird. The last time I cooked through an entire duck I cooked the following:

Rendered Duck Fat (to make anything you'd need fat in--eggs, biscuits, etc)
Duck Confit (shred off the bone + add to whatever--you can even make nuggets :) or a shepards pie style dish )
Pate
Broth 




 RESPECT 




 it was the richest thing I've ever made/consumed 









 Basically a snicker doodle with way more cinnamon! 









 Thank you kindly! I love music and lived in Seattle a spell so sub pop is close to my heart.  




 HAHA that is incredible. You're my internet hero. 




 I made a pork shoulder mix with lots of pork broth, sage, rosemary and a hit of nutmeg. Super fatty and delicious. 














 I try my best! 









 OMG twins! you're making the souffl Gotham deserves but not the one it needs right now.
