 You gotta play ["Los Cuates de Sinaloa"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUmpTKXpIdM) all the time in your car now.  ;) 




 Leaked images? Why haven't I seen these? 




 Not really, what I want and what Republicans want aren't always synonymous.

Examples:

1. Legalize friggin' marijuana already.
2. Let anyone get married at any institution that will perform the ceremony.
3. Pull all troops from any foreign country; let them protect OUR boarders, not other countries' boarders.
4. No more foreign aid until we no longer have national debt.
5. Disband the IRS, and enforce a flat tax.  It's fair.  Poor people buy cheaper things; rich people buy more expensive things.  It's fair; quit whining.
6. etc...

 To paraphrase Ronald Regan:

I didnt leave the Republican party, the Republican Party left me.

Don't get me wrong, I can't STAND Democrats, but I've slowly started hating Republicans more and more since I turned 18 back in 1999.  They're all talk, and no action.  The "Republican" candidates that do get into office are so middle-of-the-road, that nothing happens.

I think I will now consider myself a Conservative Libertarian.  Screw the (D)/(R) parties.  I'm sick of this crap. 



















 Ah.... j'aime l'inceste. 




 Well, terrorist don't seem to care what the Christians are doing; just that they're Christians... so the "Reverse-terrorism" label still stands. 




 "Reverse-terrorism"? 




 Really?  My trumpet doesn't play a note simply because I push a valve down. 




 Sampler is a button representing a set sound.

Beatboxing is live sound using an instrument (vocal and percussion). 




 Hell yes!

Kanye = listed as being able to play "keyboards", "sampler" (not even an instrument), "percussion", and "sythesizer".

Beck = listed as being able to play "guitar", "keyboards", "bass", "drums", "harmonica", "percussion", "sitar", "banjo", "slide guitar", "12-string guitar", "glockenspiel", "vocorder", "kalimba", "melodica", and "beatboxing".

I'd say Beck is a better musician. 




 Covered?  No.

A few large, dark hairs?  Yes.  Enough that it's unsettling. 




 Yeah, even MORE surfaces to get saturated in urine! 




 Every time I see this, all I see is the duck that the Americas turns into. 




 Do you ladies sometimes milk being pregnant to make people do things for you? I swear that my wife did that during each pregnancy. 




 Because most dudes don't like sucking on a hairy nipple. 




 Lady Margery of Pimbleton.  




 Herp-derp...  




 It's satirical humor.  Get a sense of humor, why don't ya? 









 Oh, my God--That needs to happen! 




 Amen to that! 




 Interesting infographic! Thanks! 




 I can't stand the dude either. 




 He's done so many of them, though. 




 Amen! 




 Bodyguards protect people from other people, not from themselves. 




 The only downside to metric time would be that a year wouldn't match the rotation of the Earth. 




 Yep.  That's exactly my point! 









 She was a little to flat for me, but she had nice nips. 




 The same nail bed, just has a gap where the nail bed might be dead.

Does it grow back at the same rate as the larger part? 




 Unfortunately, what this idiot doesn't realize is that this was an AMA... not a Kanye Music Award.

If this fuck-nut wants to judge music, let him host and pay for his own show.  What a jackass. 




 Ingrown toenail, man. 




 What the heck ***is*** that? 




 Loved the shower scene back when I was 16-17.  HAHA! 




 Married for 5 years now with three kids.  We're great! 




 And you've never even HEARD of Beck?  I could understand not being able to name a song by someone, but not even knowing who they are...?

I couldn't name a Kanye West song, but I know who he is. 




 Haha!  Weird!  I watched that last night on Netflix for nostalgia's sake. 



















 Me: "Can you PLEASE stop being so lazy around the house? I work overtime hours to come home to a messy house and you watching television!  If I didn't do the dishes, cleaned up the house, do laundry, etc., then NO ONE would. It's getting really damn old, and you're setting a bad example for the three kids!" 









 "...who acknowledge Jesus with their lips, walk out the door, and deny Him by their lifestyle. That is what an unbelieving world simply finds unbelievable."  ~Brennan Manning
_________________________

I first heard this quote in the intro to DC Talk's "What If I Stumble?" back in 1995 when I was 14 years old.  I got it then, but it means so much more to me now that I'm coming up on 34.

I strive to be a good example for others, but more specifically for my children.  I try to keep this quote in mind.  Thought I'd share it in case others haven't heard it before. 



















 It seems unfair, counter-productive, and not a valid way of seeing what the actual PARTY members want. 




















































































 Okay, there was one moment that made my jaw drop at the utter stupidity of the scientists.

Miller's Planet... massive time dilation. The team went down to get the information.  Notice the massive waves.  Brand gets the idea in her head to go get data and gets stuck.  CASE is commanded to get her.  He suddenly transforms into SUPER-SPEED MODE!  

My jaw dropped in the theater.  I turned to my wife, and whispered, "What the HELL?!"

Why didn't they just send CASE down?  He could pilot the lander; he could go into super-speed mode; make assessments; get the data; come back; and it wouldn't have been 28 years lost.  Maybe half that.   














 That's the only thing I can think of. In America, we'll have a foreign song become popular occasionally. 



























































 I was raised in the Assemblies of God church.  My mother is still a registered AG pastor, in fact.  Come 16 years ago, my parents divorced, and I backslid.  I met my wife 13 years ago, and she and her family are very Catholic.

I converted through RCIA, and received all the sacraments at the Easter Vigil Mass in 2003.  The one thing I have never agreed with, and have not participated with is confession.

Why should we go through a mediary, like a priest, when we can go strait to God, and ask for forgiveness?  Didn't make sense then, and it doesn't make sense now.

 I was a high school senior employed at a theater when that came out. I must have watched that movie 10-15 times in the theater. It was so NEW and mind-blowing at the time. 




 Star Wars Episode V: A New Hope

It was the father of modern-day sci-fi. 




 "Remote" or "Remote control". 




 Money.

I doubt their paid in pillow mints and tiny bottles of toiletries.  




 That made me laugh so hard the first time I saw him. No respect for him at all. Haha! 




 Up until recently, it's been Republican.

I've gone more Independent/Libertarian lately. 




 I don't know the baby on the right is smoking; baby on the left was not THAT funny at all. ;-) 




 Yep--same here. 




 Why the HELL did the parish allow some unprofessional moron do that?! It boggles my mind. 




 Super hi-res photo? 




 It all comes down to what people define "dance" as. To me, twerking isn't dancing; it's looking like a damn fool. 




 Bing: Translating Ebonics for your benefit. 




 Meh, I knew he'd have to die. I wouldn't consider his death a "happy" ending. More like a bitter-sweet ending.

I felt sorry for the guy in the beginning. Then he became an asshole. Then a complete dick. Then at the end, realized he was too far gone. I felt empathy for the poor bastard. Like I sort of did for Hitler after watching "Downfall". 




 Premium is worth it to me. I have it on all day during work, and all night as I sleep.  I love me some music. Haha! 




 Yep. The download tracks is awesome for when one has no wifi and a crappy data signal.

I never get ads though since I got premium. Weird... 




 Facebook is no longer required. 




 I'm a Spotify user myself.

I've used several in the past: iTunes, Rhapsody, Milk Music, etc... 




 Man, I frickin' love my GatorGrip. 




 So. Much. Plastic. Surgery. 




 Yeah--I'm hoping they are keeping a lot up their sleeves. 









 Is this more of that Common Core math? 




 He might have kicked them off in a fit of joy. 




 Seems like they just took Reddington's brain, and used it for Ultron.  LOL 




 Real interplanetary beings probably love all the decoys.  ;-) 




 Yes, that was my assumption as well (see video description). 




 I pretty much say that in the video description.  Also the reason why I put UFO in quotation marks.

It ***was*** unidentified... until I saw it moving. 














 The dress-wearing llama.  




 I agree. I hate games that practically require puchases.

"Flow" and "Flow Bridges" are fun to waste time with. 




 It's just simple politeness.  You're telling them to have a good night('s rest). 




 No. I was too busy working by that age.  




 From a bowl... with a spoon... 




 What is?  The fact that they serve Pepsi products instead of Coca-Cola? 









 Yeah--because THAT wasn't happening for the 30 minutes before I made this picture.

I don't agree with them doing so, but I don't think a government should FORCE them to do anything. Period.

 As a convert, I've often wondered if Jesus was telling us to pray that exact prayer, or just to say prayers LIKE that. The wording is sort of misleading.  




 "(sic)" by Slipknot. 




 It gets opened all the way, and used as a makeshift plate. 




 When did you know you fucked up with that unnecessary comma? 




 I was reading the daily readings today, and it reminded me of this difference. 




 It even SAYS that on the green/red/yellow band trailer screens.

 Great decision, Disney! 




 Yes, I'm a registered Republican, and they're been pissing me off lately.  So much so, that I'm seriously thinking about unregistering and voting more Libertarian. 









 Looks the same; just flipped. 




 She was so hot... what a waste.

[Just remember kids...](http://cdn.meme.am/instances/24368947.jpg)

 Phantom Menace.

1. Bloated, unnecessary storyline.

2. Jar-Jar Binks.

3. Too much politics.

4. Midi-fucking-clorians.

5. Podracing was pointless. 




 Born with a penis, you're a man; born with a vagina, you're a woman.

 It wasn't obvious... hence my comment and the upvotes it received.

 Yep.  [MyFitnessPal](http://www.MyFitnessPall.com) has helped me tremendously.  I'm on day 210 today. 




 Be sure you have some GOOD boudin while you're down. 




 Yep.  You got one from me.  Alabama is worse. 




 I've lived in [Louisiana](http://www.mapsofworld.com/usa/area-codes/maps/louisiana-area-code-map.jpg) (225 area code) my entire life of 34 years.

I've never eaten, snapping turtle, raccoon, nutria, opossum, muskrat, armadillo, or goat.

All the rest, I've had.  This place must be down in the bayou.  504 area code is New Orleans.  That's surprising.  I'd have guessed it was from the 337 area code. 




 Poor Dwight... Jim's gotten even worse with the pranks! 




 I won't lie; that was pretty damn cool. 














 Same here. I've ordered from ProFlowers 2 or 3 times. I've decided to go to a local florist from now on. Not as convenient as the internet, but at least the flowers won't be delivered uncut in a damn box. 




 While no longer cannon, the Dark Empire series was great. Read those in graphic novel form.

 Sickening.

NO ONE'S faith or religious buildings should be treated this way.  Even a Satanic cult's building and faith.  I pray for them, but I wouldn't beat them up strictly for being a Satanist.

God is love, and Jesus taught us to treat others as we would treat ourselves. 




 My wife and I binge-watched it on Netflix over a few months from start to finish. It was awesome! 
























 Re - glue it? 




 Bwahahaha! 




 1. Never go to bed angry.

2. True love is putting the other over oneself. If that happens on both sides, you're a happy couple.  If it's only one-sided, cut your losses, and find the right one. 




 Boy, that's a unique-looking lamp. 




 Psh, I'm married, and have 3 kids... can't afford a next gen console... much less have time to play it.  Hahaha! 




 No, but I miss it sometimes. 




 Life Insurance Policy 




 Red Dead Redemption 




 2008 Ford Focus SE (Black)

2010 Mazda CX-9 (Black) 




 The child-catcher from Chitty-Chitty Bang-Bang always creeped me out.  

And the beginning scene from The Peanut Butter Hair Solution. 




 Yeah, not chant, but that was simply amazing. Great acoustics/reverb in that location as well.

Those harmonies were TIGHT! 




 Amen!  They don't seem to understand that we get tired of trying and not succeeding. 









 Nah, my daughter will drive my Ford Focus probably.  She can connect her phone via Bluetooth, and will only be allowed to CALL people; no texting.

I drive on the interstate, and see people texting, browsing the internet, e-mailing, etc. on their phones while we're going 70+ mph.  I'm just thinking, "WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU?!" 









 She'd grind that transmission to a pulp in Baton Rouge, Louisiana's stop-n-go traffic. 




 Really?  I didn't know they believed that.  Learned something new. 




 I have a 15yo already talking about driving... she lives with her damn face glued to her phone.  This is the shit I'm afraid of. 




 The Legend of the Drunken Master was unbelievable! I was flabbergasted when I heard him say he had to deliberately slow the scenes and moves down some to make them distinguishable to movie-goers. 




 Where all the other techno-fads go. 




 Funny, but [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JElywbkSbY) is the very first thing I thought of when I first heard of the Wii U. 




 No, you stumbled upon the yet-to-be-announced Ritz Tacos from Taco Bell. 




 Good find.  This video made me subscribe. 




 LOL 




 I've seen those!  I've also seen a 12-13yo girl walking around with shorts that had "paint"-like handprints on both ass-cheeks... as if someone with painted hands put hands on her ass.

She was a damn pre-teen! 




 What the hell is wrong with our society...?! 




 I've heard of about 80% of these, and all of them are fucking disgusting. 




 I've never been there, but I still chuckled. 




 Yeah, I've heard of the Gospel of Judas.

Not to mention an entire "bible" written by Lucifer himself. 




 I've seen someone eating cereal from a bowl while driving on the interstate. FROM A BOWL.  That take's two damn hands to do! 




 281,694 (at my work computer). 




 Ah, well... there you have it.  Thanks, /u/Bremstralung. 














 LMFAO!  I forgot about that.  How ridiculous! 




 Okay, that was pretty badass!  Good find, /u/Dennepis ! 




 Student body crap were always pointless positions. 




 In that case, have an "upvote"! 




 Was that supposed to be English they were speaking? 




 I guess I'm referring more to "blind from birth" blind. 




 I can't tell you how many times I've healed major bosses by summoning the same element as the boss (e.g., summoning Shiva on an ice-elemental boss). 




 Wouldn't that have killed all of the caster's companions as well? 




 Look!  It's Kung Lao's grandfather! 




 But I wasn't sure if it was similar to unused muscles becoming atrophied.  If a blind person doesn't really USE their eyes, do parts of the ocular system become "atrophied"?  That's kind of what I was thinking. 




 I wasn't sure what triggered the dilation.

Seems odd for the body to expend energy to do something that serves no real purpose (to a blind person, that is). 









 "[S]he doesn't know how to use the shells..." 




 It's no iLuminate, but it was good! 




 Sounds like a group of guys saying "Hey!" over and over again. 




 As an American, I vote for Miller Lite over Bud Lite.  Bud beers are gross.

My favorite beer of all-time is [Almaza](http://www.lacproducts.com/products/beer/Almaza.jpg). 




 No conflict there.  Forget the damn donuts! 




 Send myself a certified check for a large sum of money in the mail. 




 I stopped it when I heard the stupid-ass "Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!" junk in the background.  I can't stand that crap. 




 I have one too.  Damn thing over-boils onto my microwave every time.  That fill line is bogus. 




 Good Lord!  Don't eat them!  Cover them in clear coat to preserve them for a museum of never-seen-again objects! 




 For the life of me, I can't remember. 




 Yes, I am a conservatively-leaning Libertarian in Louisiana.

I used to love Jindal.  He's done a lot of good things for this state.

Lately, however, he's been saying some batty things. 




 As an American who doesn't watch soccer... this is what soccer is to me.  Acting... on a field... with a ball... 




 ...yeah... this was on the front page... 




 ***Mission: Impossible*** -- Great Movie.

***Mission: Impossible II*** -- Horrible Sequel.

***Mission: Impossible III*** -- Improved Sequel.

***Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol*** -- As good as the original.

***Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation*** -- I've got high hopes; don't let me down! 




 Haha!  Nice one, /u/MechaGrimm ! 




 I don't get it. 




 I started working at McDonald's the week after I turned 15. It wasn't a great job, but it was a job. As a very young person, your options are very limited. You take what you can get, and you don't bitch about it. 




 Hehe, poor person hates their cubicle,  and dreams of the beach. 




 Sunday morning, Tuesday morning, and Thursday morning.

I have some stubble on the between-days... enough that it's noticeable, but whatever. 




 Probably because no one watched it. 




 That's pretty ingenious, actually. 




 ...God, I love the internet.  HAHAHA! 




 Hehehe... ya got me.  Read the title, said, "WHAT?!".  Then looked at the pic, and said, "Ooooohhhh...." 




 No, people can be offended and say they are offended. The people that think being offended is against their rights is what annoys me. "That white man said the word 'nigger', and it offended me. I'm taking him to court!"

That kind of shit is what clogs our judicial system and makes us the lawsuit-crazy world we are. 




 This.

People think they have a right to not be offended.  "I'm offended by [whatever]!"  "Well, good for you.  Now shut the hell up." 




 Happy cake day, /u/problatikal.

You get karma from me, since I only got 15 on my cake day.  :-( 




 I know, right?! 




 See the brief clip of her doing do in my post above. 




 They can be linked together to form a dual-bladed lightsaber.

 The fight scenes were the only good parts of that movie.  Acting was "bleh", story was "bleh". 




 I love Madeon's music.  "The City" is probably my favorite with "Finale" being a close second. 




 How about just limiting it to one-vote-per-person and legal voters?

Sounds like a LEGAL FRICKIN' PLAN TO ME! 




 Younger kids are more liberal-leaning because they are lazy and want things GIVEN to them instead of working hard to earn it.  They demand instant gratification. 




 Haha!  You know what I mean! 




 Yep, same here.  And she isn't as attractive as I remember her bring.  Now, she comes off as just being needy and whiney. 




 Great show.  Had a little crush on here. 




 Really?  Looks like a potato to me. 




 Man, Epona has some great muscle dexterity to hold that rearing pose so still for so long!  




 Boom Beach, AdVenture Capitalist, Link Dots, and SimCity BuildIt.  




 I prefer cane syrup myself.

My family gets together every year and make our own, but the Steen's brand here in the South is a good alternative. 




 Man, I friggin' loved the Wraith Squadron books.  Some of my favorite characters came from those books.  I have never laughed out loud while reading like I had at parts of those books.

 




 Thanks.  Apparently, unlike everyone else in /r/Catholicism, I'm not 100% well-versed with the catechism.  I'm assuming from his/her comment that /u/o_hai_mark can quote it like the Bible.  ((eyeroll)) 




 Let me play Devil's Advocate here... does the catechism ever describe self-pleasure as being a sin? 




 Good point!  Zedd is more of a "hippy", and loves food! 









 True. I do like the WoT series better overall... although it can be a tad too descriptive sometimes.  The SoT got a little repetitive and deus ex machina sometimes. 




 Not a problem for me with any embarrassing site, because I back all the way out, and purge my history every time I use my browser. 




 I'm gonna assume you mean:
 "I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor. You cannot pass. The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udn. Go back to the Shadow! You cannot pass."

Gandalf is making three very specific references as both warning and challenge to the Balrog. by identifying himself as a servant of the secret fire (or Flame impersishable), Gandalf is identifying himself as a Maiar, an embodied angelic servant of the Valar protecting the light of Creation that Eru Iluvatar (or God) has set to burn at the centre of Arda (Earth).

Wieldor of the flame of Anor is a reference to his ability to draw on the power of the sun possibly through the Ring of Fire Narya but maybe also through his own divine origins.

Finally as he refers to the Balrog as the Flame of Udun, he informs the Balrog that he knows it to be a corrupted Maiar in the service of Morgoth from the earliest time when he resided as Melkor in his dark fortress of Utumno broken by the Valar at the awakening of the Elves. He orders it to retreat (go back to the shadows) or face the consequences of divine conflict and final judgement before the Valar Mandos the fate of all slain creatures. 




 Just finished re-reading the good part of the Sword of Truth series (leave out the later-published Richard and Kahlan series), and have started re-reading the Wheel of Time series again.

Which of the two characters listed above is your favorite, and why? 




 I've been looking forward to my cakeday ever since I learned what a cakeday was. I joined Reddit after I got sick of 4chan. I was getting to old for 4chan's shit... just like m00t apparently has.

I've enjoyed my first year here at Reddit. I learn about events before most other people. I see cool Internet things before they become mainstream. Etc.

Thanks, fellow Redditors, and I look forward to year 2! 




 So TODAY is my cake day? Why use past tense verbs, Reddit? 




 It says "celebrated" which is past tense. 









 "I love you." 




 Because it's an easy religion. It excuses pretty much any bad behavior. 




 A non-standard 9V battery I would assume. 




 Apply directly to the forehead. 




 Screw that!  It probably costs $25 for that stupid thing.

I'll take a $5.99 triple-chocolate meltdown any day. 




 "Beeps in tenth" 




 Why hello, Facebook image from a month ago. 




 1st Try: "Oops, okay... try again."

2nd Try: "Yeah--okay, we're leaving." 




 That's what most of these "prank" YouTube channels think they can do.  "It's just a prank!"  "It's for a video!"  "It's for YouTube!"

"Yeah--well, walking up and kissing my wife on the lips isn't funny, you asshole." 




 It's not Christmas now until I hear this song:

[Happy Holidays (Beef Wellington Remix)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XJjW_Gelmo) 




 This guy is a dick. 




 We keep ours that way because we had kids.  Now that they are old enough to know better, we keep it like that out of habit. 




 Yay for stereotypes! 




 Saw that it was Ray Williams Johnson's channel and came back.

How DARE you spread RWJ crap over Reddit. 




 No, she was hired to do the work by the parish. 




 With severe skepticism.  




 So... a gay, black woman has it hardest of all then, eh? 
























 "MOVE! GET OUT THE WAY! I GOTTA GO TO THE BATHROOM!" 














 I remember when he didn't have the Mr. Fusion on the back, nor the ... ?coolant tubes/wires? on the doors.  I was stoked to see him finally get them made to be on there.  Seeing him add onto it more and more over the years has been fun. 




 Oh, no.  I know this guy.  I see him all over Baton Rouge, LA.  Hope it's a flat, and not something more... sinister.  I love seeing his car around town. 




 She's too.... cute.  Psyloche should be a... sultry, hot woman.  




 Had them chronically in high school. Both big toes.  I was in the marching band.  The roll-stepping of marching band suuuuucked with my toes. 




 It's sickening that the server got $7k for serving a normal table super-expensive wine/champagne.

It's not like that shit is served any different than the $12 bottle of liquor.  Percentage tipping--especially forced tipping--is so stupid. 




 Best laugh since ["Dad at Comedy Barn"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Y4keqTV6w).

 This is an extremely common occurrence... why do people keep posting these pics? 




 LMFAO!!! 




 That's creepy as hell.

Not to mention Bina48's derp face from time to time. 




 Ugh--same here.  I can't stand that shit. 




 Hurr-dee-durr... 




 The "Chewbacca" thing had me laughing.  Haha!  Thanks for that! 




 The blacks in my area were ALL about the first-black-President agenda.  I promise you.  That's all we heard. 




 I bet everyone will jump on the First-Female-President bandwagon just like they did the First-Black-President bandwagon. 




 "Good trade. Thanks!"

Their local rep came by our office, but all we got was an stress-reliever "ass" to squeeze, and some pens.  ***LOL*** 




 Yep, I actually specified the [**Haiku**](http://www.bigassfans.com/products/haiku/) for a job a few months ago.

 I do electrical design, and I will never forget the first time I heard of this manufacturer over the phone.

"Haha-yeah, you need a big one."

"No, it's called a Big Ass Fan.  That's who makes them."

 I hate it when Hulu does that!  




 Glad to hear I'm not the only one. 




 With the exception of The Flash, I haven't found a CW show I actually like.

The Flash has a little of the cheese added on top, but it fits with the characters, and isn't distracting... Except for Iris... she's a moron. 




 Couldn't agree more about The Arrow.  Finished Season 2 on Netflix, but not sure I care anymore to watch Season 3. 




 I just finished S1E2, and I'm wondering if it's worth it.

Told my wife, who was watching it with me, that the acting and dialogue is like that of a CW show.  Turns out, I was right.  HAHA!

tl;dr -- Should I watch this show?

 I had a plumber tell me that the only "flushable wipe" that won't screw up your plumbing system is toilet paper.

These things labeled as "flushable wipes" keep him quite busy with unclogging toilets and pipes.

 Yes, public transportation works in cities where everything is clumped together.

I live in Baton Rouge, LA, and everything we need to get to is spread out somewhat.  I also have to go to meetings a lot--sometimes at the drop of a hat.

Public transportation doesn't work well for me, or my city. 




 This wasn't "WILD", there was no "chase" to be seen, and I have no idea what "distance" you're talking about.  This isn't even "funny", so it doesn't belong in /r/funny.

 Baton Rouge, LA diocese.

St. Stephen the Martyr 




 We have a new priest this year, and he uses incence.  I am a convert, and have never dealt with it.

After blessing the consecration, he turns to the congregation, bows, blesses each side, and bows again.

My question: Do I bow the first time; as he blesses me; or the last bow?  Do I make the sign of the cross?  Do I do nothing?

I'm so confused, and it appears the majority of the congregation is as well based upon their responses.  Haha! 




 Well, guess it DID have enough spin. Didn't appear as such, but you were there. Cool! I thought the runner AND catcher did great jobs! 




 Anyone under the age of 18... 




 I agree. I mainly posted it for the song. 




 Cool, but kind of a one-trick pony. Can only do wailing notes... not shredding. 




 Yes. I was an usher in a previous job.

 Not as bad as I would have thought, actually.

I'd have to move though, as I live in Baton Rouge, LA. 




 The ball was bouncing very low to the ground, and hits a wall.  Not sure what would make it pop up 3-4' in the air. 




 The angle(s) don't seem to be right for that to happen. 




 That red-head was so hot back then.  I can't remember the video, but there was one where she was practically naked on a bed.  Damn.

 I'll stick with Spotify.  Tidal is sponsored/backed by several artists I can't stand.  It also REQUIRES a "30-day" trial (i.e., there is no free service with commercials).  I'm not giving you my credit card number to get a 30-day trial.  Screw you. 




 Whether the jump was "illegal" or not, I'm glad the umpire called him safe for one reason:

Someone tossed the loose ball back to the catcher instead of making him scramble for it.  The runner probably would've been safe otherwise.

 I loved these shorts!  They were some of my favorites.

There was also a counting short that used colored sand to create an African vibe.  The background singing was something like, "uh-DOONG-a-ding-a-ding; uh-DOONG-a-ding-a-ding..."

For the life of me, I can NOT find that video anywhere... or find someone who remembers it.

 This "Kim" woman apparently died very recently from an illness.  Must be why this video popped up again. 




 I agree.  A little too much hype for this video too.

Edit: Pretty sure she's wearing a bra under her cut-off.

 Did you voice a Conservative view-point in /r/politics?  Nah, you'd have 100+ if that were the case. 




 Android... screw Apple and it's closed system that requires iTunes to do everything. 




 Yes.  The world is a world of generali(z/s)ations.

Side-note: as a generalized, lazy American, I make it a point not to learn how every version of every word is spelled in every language.  Who has time for that? 




 That's my point entirely.  The way one carries themselves speaks wonders.  If you're talking on your phone instead of serving me my food; complaining to a coworker about how much you hate being at work instead of checking out my groceries; etc, you're annoying as hell. 




 Yes.  It does.  Hence the term "generali***Z***ing". 




 My experience based upon most Mexicans that I've encountered. 




 When 90% of the people you meet act that way, the small 10% gets lumped in. Sorry. That's how it works. 




 Precisely.  




 It was a tongue-in-cheek, rhetorical question based upon the fact that most Mexicans show little interest in adapting, and want the U.S. to be more like Mexico. 




 If one dresses, speaks, and acts a certain way, they are labeled as such in my mind.

In my city (Baton Rouge, LA; but New Orleans is worse), GENERALLY SPEAKING, blacks are lazy, low-work-ethic, governmental-freeloaders who do nothing but leech off the system while not contributing.  If they DO get jobs, they're on their damn cellphones or talking to each other rather than assisting the customers.

Want me to treat you like a valid citizen?  Then BECOME one. BBM 




 So you must not like the Mexicans in the U.S. then, eh? 




 /r/politics is a liberal circle-jerk.

 I've sung in the at my church since I converted 13 years ago.  We mostly sing out of the Gather Comprehensive and Spirit   Song books that the congregation has copies of.

We rarely go out-of-book, because all of our priests have cared about participation. We sing to minister, not to perform. They are a congregation, not an audience.

I've been to other churches, and I know exactly what you mean.

 Y'know, I normally am fine with the one-hour thing, but this was never told to me when I went through RCIA thirteen years ago. Interesting. 




 Isn't the Eucharist fast only 30 minutes?  If you don't get there by 11:15 or so, they're all gone.  They used to be tasty Mary Lee donuts, but now they're always "meh" Krispe Kreme.  I pass. 




 I go to noon (last one of the Sunday), and if you don't get there to grab one BEFORE mass starts, they don't have any after.  It's always only after 10:00 mass.

 If they blocked my way to a class I have paid for with my own money--used gas I've paid for with my own money--used my personal time to go to--I'd call the cops.

They can protest, but they aren't allowed to block people.  What a waste of air and energy. 




 Wow... that was pretty bad.  Hopefully, it's just chalked up to live conditions and not the fact that they're just frickin' too old to do this now.  Jeez!

 /u/VeteranRook, I'm a 13-year convert raised Assemblies of God.  I had the same issue; it was my only and last hang-up.

It was described very well by /u/chan_kohaku.  I just wanted to let you know you weren't alone in questioning this. 




 It needs [this sound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ytCEuuW2_A) played on it.

 I am the only one in my family that likes the following:

 Of course not. 




 **YouTube** ... That's about it. 




 That's what I was thinking.

I'm thinking this caretaker is a zoophile. 




 There was no other way than LICKING?  Seriously? 




 That went the complete opposite direction I thought it would. 




 Pursuit Of Happiness 




 Mechanical. 

I work as an electrical designer (under an engineer) and we do commercial design work for architects. We deal with several disciplines. The mechanical subs appear to always get their units and spec data directly from a manufacturer instead of doing it themselves.

Not to mention they get us the electrical data the day before the job is due. HVAC is a HUGE percentage of electrical load. We do most of the actual engineering right at the end. 




 Because feminism has turned into belittling men to raise women.

They want nothing to with equallity. They won't stop until all men are cowed under the dominant female sex. 




 I utilize technical writing on a daily basis for work (I am an electrical designer for commercial buildings).  We use the Oxford (or "Serial") comma so as to not create confusion or ambiguity. 




 Good point. 




 Why only low-income kids?  This is America where all are equal.

Either free e-books for all or none. 




 What the hell did I just watch...? 




 I agree with /u/Sixteen_Million. 




 That last part would be a great dynamic to the game.  I wouldn't bother with the healing/damage.  That would get annoying to play with.  The interacting with specific colors however, adds a depth to the strategy that is pretty cool. 




 Are the wireframe sections strictly for aesthetics, or do they react differently than the rest of the structure? 




 Well, that was downright adorable. 




 This!  Interdimensional beings don't belong in the Star Wars universe. What the hell was Vonda N. McIntyre thinking?!  At least this was her only Star Wars novel--let her stick to her Star Trek novels.

 Yep!  That's my point.

What my iTeen has to do to get a ringtone on her phone compared to me is about 5-10 minute difference. 




 My daughter wanted ringtones, she had to put through iTunes before she could put it on her iPhone.

 Congrats on the soon-to-be baby then! 




 I tell my 15yo iTeen the same thing. 




 Andoid has the same thing, it's called any PC anywhere... not the iTunes program on the one computer you have linked to it. 




 Ah, yes, I think I remember seeing that picture of "Empty Server List" or something.  You were the soon-to-be father? 




 He's 4yo now, and still does this if you start the chant.  Haha!

Also, having kids in the car doesn't mean you get to drive on the wrong side of the road.  Drunk-ass hick.

 I was thinking the same thing. This brought back dial-up AOL days. Hahaha! 




 That's a way of looking at it, but he says DWW's name, and uses pronouns like "you".  I'd say he's talking directly.

 Wind In His Hair: "Dances with Wolves! I am Wind In His Hair. Do ***you*** see that I am ***your*** friend? Can ***you*** see that ***you*** will always be my friend?"

He also ends with a question... Although it could be read as rhetorical.  




 At the end of the movie, Wind In His Hair is yelling to Dances With Wolves about how they are friends, and always will be.  Dances With Wolves never replies or even acknowledges his friend's words.  This always bothers me.  Why?  Was it a Lakota thing? 









 If my wife did this to me, I think it'd freak me out.  




 Boobs. 




 Girl graduates high school.

Girl majors in feminism.

Girl miraculously finds a job she loves. 




 The fact that she's lazy as hell, forcing me to clean up 90% of our family's mess.

I don't ignore it really, but I never say anything. 




 I like to use the fruit/vine method.

The fruit (electronic device) has to be back on the vine (charger) before bedtime, or it's taken away the next day or two. The charger is in a very public part of the house (in our case, the living room). 




 The songs he has are very... convincing. It's bizarre.  




 There's only the problem of a 3 and 4 year old who DON'T have the ability to take care of themselves.

 Wow... bet that tasted nasty. 









 Yeah--that's a good idea.  Thanks! 









 Agreed.  I've been working part- or full-time since I was 15yo.  I had to so I could pay for my phone and car insurance.  Then it moved to helping pay for rent/bills when my parents divorced, and my mom didn't have a GREAT job.  I had to grow up quickly. 




 We tell her all the time to ask us if she needs help. 




 Which wasn't a problem when homework was done with books/paper.

Now it's on a laptop that we have no way of keeping an eye on unless we're literally sitting over her shoulder. 




 Wow... wish I didn't know that now... 




 It is a very nice school; worth the $8k+ if results are made.  We've had meetings with the teachers; she's met with the guidance counselor.  Her grades started declining around 6th grade, and have gotten progressively worse each year.

She says she realizes this.

While I was working late last night, my wife sat down and talked to her about everything for about 1 hours.  My wife said our daughter DOES care, but just doesn't let us know for some odd reason. 




 PM sent. 




 The original owner Kyoo sold it to one of the Admins: DarthBrendo.

 This is a forum that's been around since 1999.  Back then, it was known as Jedi.net.  I've been around since 2000.  We've tried to pick the site back up now that the new movies/shows/etc. are back out.  We could use some fresh blood.

There's discussion on multiple topics, role-playing, fanfic, fanart, etc.  Come on over, and let's chat about Star Wars.

My username there is: [Stephen](http://i.imgur.com/gj4Vw7K.jpg).  Come join me! 









 A baby doll. 




 Haha, I've done the "job is school" bit.  Didn't think about the rest. 




 How would you have afforded $8.5k ?! 




 We've been dating/married since the step-daughter was 10-months-old.  I've helped raise her.

Nothing major has happened lately. 




 I cannot STAND the laptop. 




 She was allowed to keep our church's children's choir as it was her last year to be able to be in it, and she's been in it since 3rd grade.

Really, by activities, it was really just the book club and sporting events. 




 It's frustration.  This is year #4 with the same problems getting worse and worse... no matter what we do.

 









 We shouldn't have to go through this much crap.  Y'know?!

Get your work done, THEN fart around!

If they spent as much effort doing homework as they do trying to get around firewalls, blocks, etc., they'd be done in 30-60 mins tops. 




 She's my step-daughter, and her daughter, so my opinion doesn't factor as much.

When it comes to our other two kids, I'd put my foot down (assuming they are selfish and lazy like their sister). 




 The private school academics ARE better than the public school... if one does the work.

If one doesn't, there's no point. 




 She keeps finding new apps to chat with as I delete and block others. 




 That's how I think as well... my wife believes otherwise. 




 I tried some of those, her school IT said I had to take them off because it was affecting her work while on the school's server/firewall.

They also use YouTube and whatnot for school. 




  Has she always been a lazy kid - who doesn't see any reason to put in more than minimal effort?

Yes.

 Are you (as parents) or her siblings high acheivers? Is there pressure to be an achiever? is she rebelling against pressure or expectations that either she doesn't want or feels she can't meet?

We just expect her to do her work, and show actual effort in her studies.  That is lacking.

 Have you had her tested for a learning disability? Do you see times when she is absolutely able to do well if she applies herself?

She was tested for ADD/ADHD, and the test shown borderline minimal results.  Those times are few and far between.

 Is her personality counter to school culture - is she a free spirited, creative kid who doesn't like too much structure or being put in a box? Is she more hands on ?

She is very hands-on.

 What are her talents, hobbies, interests? When do you see her really engage in something? What does she enjoy? Where does she put effort?

She doesn't really have any REAL hobbies that she gets truly engaged into... unless texting/video-chatting on her friggin' phone is considered a hobby.

 Does she see any connection between school and her life? Any ideas what she wants to do after high school? Any older kids who she knows that have gone on to college?

She says she does. Says she wants to go to college. Apparently is now interested in photography (since she shows no signs of taking photos).  She has an older cousin attending LSU right now.

 Is she engaged at school outside of academics? Strong circle of friends? gets along with teachers? Involved in clubs, sports, teams or other school related extracurriculars?

She has had her extracurricular activities taken away as punishment for grades.  She has only one REAL friend...

 How is she mood wise? Lots of teen angst? Any signs of depression? Does she want to e Goth or emo or non mainstream in her self-expression?

Aside from treating me like a stereotypical step-daughter treats her step-father; no. 




 Her cell phone is on our company's plan, paid for by us.

Clothes are paid for by us.

Entertainment (which doesn't happen very often) is sometimes her and sometimes us. 




 The teachers were willing to help a lot in her 6th-8th grade levels.  Now, everything is on her school-provided distraction (i.e., required laptop).  While she's "doing her homework" (i.e., watching YouTube, chatting with friends, etc.), we assume she's doing her homework.

Her teachers view the students as being to be responsible by this age (which they should), and will sort of help with large assignments if asked, but not day-to-day homework. 




 Gold?  Who do you think I am?  Letterman? 









 That's not what I meant exactly.  She can be lazy and lie about doing homework and whatnot for free at a public school instead of paying $800+ a month for the same end-effect. 




 Scenario: 15yo daughter just completed her freshman year at a private, Catholic school costing $8k a year.  Showed little to no initiative in schoolwork, constantly got zeroes on homework, poor grades on tests, let to failing one class and barely getting C's and D's in others.

Tuition is going up to $8.5k next year, and I argue for taking her out of the school since it's practically a waste of money. 

My wife argues to keep her in because it's a better education than the public schools in East Baton Rouge (Louisiana) Parish.

I counter-argue that it's not a better education if she's not getting anything from it anyway because she simply doesn't care, and constantly complains about how hard it is.

*Edit: Thanks for all the comments.  This is an issue we've been struggling with for a few years.  Any time we try to determine why, all we get is either, "I don't know," or, "It's just how I am."*

1. /u/SteveHarveysSuit -- I'm not sure we know exactly what she'd want.  She's all about social, so I'd be willing to bet she'd pick staying just to not have to make friends all over again.

2.  /u/NovelTeach and /u/dmf95742 -- She makes no money to pay for anything.  That would require a job.  We tried the F = -$10; D = -$5; C = $0; B = +$5; and A = +$10 for report cards, but when the negatives outweigh the positives, it became pointless.

3. /u/flakemasterflake -- She doesn't seem to care about peer pressure... at least academically. 




 It sounds like you rushed into RCIA before you were ready. I was raised Assemblies of God.  I attended Catholic mass for two years before going through RCIA.  

I spoke to many Catholics about many things. You need to find a few solid Catholics, and just talk with them a while.  We all go through it.

I too struggled with masturbation. Not so much a problem now that I'm married. Hehe.  That one is tough.  I'd suggest /r/NoFap for support on that one.

Talk to priest or deacon you trust. Get counseling sessions set up.  I'm sure they'd work with you.

Side-Note: I believe that homosexuality itself is not a sin. Acting on the sexual urges, and therefore committing fornication/adultery, is the sin. 




 Purely coincidental, I think. 




 Fourty-two. 




 Holy crap--I can't believe that works!  HAHAHAHA!

 Only wanting to tax the rich while not taxing the poor is hypocritical in a society truly based on equality.

 Flat tax on purchased goods ***only***.

Someone making $30k a year might spend $200-$300 month on food.  9% tax on that is only $27.  They might buy a $5k used car.  9% tax on that is $450.

Someone making $100k a year might spend $1200 a month on food.  9% tax on that is $108.  They might buy an $85k new car.  9% tax on that is $7,650!

tl;dr :: Rich people buy more (and more expensive) things than poor people.  It's fair.

 I am an electrical designer for an electrical engineer. We do consulting engineering, and are mostly hired by architects to design the electrical portions of projects (e.g., lighting, power, mechanical connections, special systems, etc.)

HAHAHAHA!  So true.  These people don't know how hard it is to live when you aren't getting free shit from the government.

Downvote this all you want; it's true. 




 Simple.

You are empathetic. 




 Everyone is racist against some race to some degree.  To say that you aren't racist at all means you suffer from self-delusions.  If you sit back, and seriously think about your thought patterns, you'd realize that you are racist against *some* race for *some* reason. 




 The MLK Jr/Ghandi one was friggin' awesome.  Best closing line of ANY battle.  EVER.

 Yes, that seemed a very intentional piece of dialogue. 




 The Lewis and Clark/Bill and Ted one was good.

My favorites are the ones with Key and Peele in them. 




 I was so excited to see this in my subscriptions page.

Then I was completely let down by the "meh" quality of it. 




 I noticed that as well.  Guess Drogon doesn't care about friendly fire. 




 True, but the fact that there is even a debate over this blew my mind.  They have rinsed my mouth out at the dentist after a brushing, so I've always assumed it was supposed to be done. 




  ... if you rinse with water after brushing your teeth, then you are rinsing away the benefits that fluoride provides to your teeth. 









 But he's not racist, because I've been told several times that a minority CAN'T be racist.....  




 They need to say that on the Windows 10 Upgrade program that pops up in the sustem tray. 




 Because it says "FOR A YEAR" when it should say "The free upgrade is valid for a year. After the year is up, you will have to pay to upgrade." 




 I've yet to see costs for the upgrade after the first year is over. Also, what happens after the year is up? Is Windows still usable to some degree? 




 Any suggestions? 









 ...and no one cares.

 It's the same where I live (in Baton Rouge, Louisiana). You aren't alone.

And I hate it when after making a generalized statement, people immediately come back and say "not all of them are....".  Yeah--no crap, there isn't a single thing in the world that is 100% the same across the board.

/u/promisejustcurious is simply stating that in the are where they work, black people seem to be disrespectful of people's time, money, and service.   









 My point exactly.  If he was in the act, you do it in a locked room with no way for anyone outside to get in. 




 Why would anyone not hide the fact they were gay if they lived in Iraq?

 The full expression is "deus ex machina", and it is a character or thing that suddenly enters the story in a novel, play, movie, etc., and solves a problem that had previously seemed impossible to solve.

 Brits can't even spell "pedophile" properly. 




 We've done several city/state projects; I hate that lowest bidder rule. 




 Depends on the contractor, but yeah.  When doing above-ceiling inspections, I've seem some shady shit. 




 I'm caucasoid, yes. 




 Pretty much.  Lighting design is part of my job. 




 Man, just looking at that gives me [heartburn](http://images.agoramedia.com/everydayhealth/gcms/photogallery_heartburn_and_foods_dos_and_donts_01_full.jpg).

 Nope. Haven't tried it.

 When I first heard the plan that Maine was going, I cheered for them.  I wish every state would do it.  Force people to TRY before you give them free handouts on the taxpayer dollar.

 I laughed when I read that America doesn't have a work ethic problem.

They clearly haven't gone anywhere in the service industry where I live.  Most workers just don't give a crap. 




 I think they are completely separate from angels.  They co-exist with human spirits in Heaven.  While human spirits exist in Heaven only to worship the Holy Trinity, the angelic masses server purposes or roles based on their level in the angelic hierarchy:

1st Triad - Seraphim  Cherubim  Thrones

2nd Triad - Dominions  Virtures  Powers

3rd Triad - Principalities  Archangels  Angels 




 Funny enough--it was me that misspoke.

This post is my fault.  I'm so, so sorry. 




 Reminded me of [this scene](http://www.tboake.com/images/film_images/fifth_element/fifth5/fifth5_web/cap161_resize.jpg) from Fifth Element. 




 Technically, all the beings God created had free will.

Lucifer wanted to be like God and create life to worship him.  THIS is what he started the war in Heaven over.  He convinced masses of other angels to rebel with him. 




 Not true; no one prays for demons or evil spirits either. 




 Christians pray for human souls.  Lucifer never was, and never will be, a human soul.  He was created as an angel directly by God.  He desired free-will, and turned away from God.

Prayers by humans could never reverse what was done.

Personally, I'd use heavies and zookas.  I'd drop 2-3 artillery on the launcher; drop a barrage or two on the boom; then utilize shocks while my heavies/zookas attacked everything.

 The not feeling empathy was a side-note.

As for Summer Glau, the only things I've liked her in were where she's playing robot-like characters (Firefly/Serenity and Terminator).  I wasn't a fan of her in The Arrow. 




 But he shows so little emotion that I don't feel no empathy towards him.  I care more about his psychiatrist than I do him. 




 Yeah--that's retarded as well.  That's why I don't watch pro sports.  Grown men/women getting paid millions to play a kids game... *smh* 




 Every television show that stars Christian Slater has never made it past Season 1... some didn't even complete a full season before it was pulled.

I know it was renewed after episode 1, but that can be changed if ratings don't keep up.

Don't get your hopes up for this show.  I've watched all the episodes so far, and I don't feel a connection to ANY of the characters--much less Elliot. 




 What the fuck is wrong with this country when a no-talent, screaming, asshole like PDP can make $7.5M a year when hard-working, bill-paying, child-raising people like me struggle paycheck to paycheck?! 




 Why change what worked.  I never equated spanking as hitting.  It was punishment given to me by my parents for what I did--it wasn't them hitting me. 




 56% of Catholics support gay marriage?!  What in the--?!

Having homosexual urges == not a sin.

Acting on homosexual urges == a sin (i.e., adultery).

If Catholics accept homosexual marriage, it would no longer be considered adultery, and therefore would no longer be a sin.  This, in essence, would be changing church dogma.  How are any Catholics for same-sex marriage? 




 Not a terrible parent. I've done the same thing to an older child.

Only step you left out that I would have done was spanking. I was spanked as a child, and it was effing effective. 









 Anakin Skywalker did not bring balance to the Force, because Luke and Leia were still alive--thus tipping the Force to the light side. 




 Yeah--okay. You're real and everything--sure... 




 Not a bad idea. 




 I agree. If they're going to legalize same-sex, might as well legalize them all. 




 That's what I get for trusting auto-fill on my phone. Snrk.

 Former Papa John's driver here.

I knocked on an apartment door, and when it opened, the smell of weed wafted out.  Some skanky-looking blonde says, "Hey--come on in."  "Uhhhh....," I replied, "...okay...".

They had porn playing on the TV, and not only were the visuals distracting, but the incessant moaning of the woman on the screen.

They said to set the pizza down on the coffee table.  I went to do so, and realized that I had to miss the lines of cocaine they had ready to go.

She hands a wallet to a guy sitting there, and he hands me cash.  With a wink he said, "A little something extra for being such a nice guy."  I walked back to my car shaking my head, and expecting a nice tip.  After taking out the price of the pizza, it was a whopping $3.05 tip.

I should've called the cops on the cheap bastards.  HAHA!

 No, I can't stand that.  I have an older guy we work with on occasion (friend of the family) that calls me "Stevie".  I'm a grown man with three kids (one of which is a teenager), and he calls me Stevie.  SMH 




 Well, that was SO not worth the wait. 




 Psh--I wish I had been a hacker.  I had downloaded a few "viruses", but had no idea what to do with them.  HAHA!  I was not a l337 h4xx0r. 




 Pretty sure they had started killing it (hence the bloody-looking neck wound and knife-wielding, blue-shirted man), and it decided to fight back. 




 What's with the link in the "f"? 




 No.  I'm a 34yo man with nothing to hide.  I don't need my 90's "hacker" alias of "CorruptShadow" anymore. 




 Holy crap--how did you know my name?! 




 Exactly, I try not to be a dick, and to just be myself. 




 Um...yes...because I do. 




 Odds are, if it wasn't seen on the show, it's fake. 




 In Louisiana, where I live, it appears to be the "black culture".  I can only attribute the harsher viewpoints on the fact that the black culture in this area is gangbanger. I'd assume a gay gangbanger would be labeled as a punk and not "hard".

 We tried that too.  She made fish sticks and mac and cheese every week for her meal because "that's all I know how to make".

We tried telling her to look for recipes and try new ones... that's what adults do.  No go.

 By the time she gets home, feeds the kids, bathes the kids, and gets them in bed, she "doesn't feel like doing anything".

I, on the other hand, when in the same place will include cleaning up my crap before I veg out and watch television.

She has friends.  She definitely has a supportive husband.  She might be depressed due to me not being around a lot.  Work has gotten crazy lately. 




 How do I have such a conversation without coming across as if I'm saying, "You're lazy, and you're teaching the kids lazy behavior by being that way"? 




 We both work to pay for private school tuitions (public schools suck here).

The teenager doesn't give a crap about money surprisingly.  If she doesn't have it, she has an "oh, well" attitude about it.  Totally annoying. 




 $300/month for food is low unless you love eating ramen or beans and rice.

Typically, housing should be 25% of your budget.  Right now, your rent estimate is 34%.  It's manageable if you make a budget per month and stick with it.

Okay, not sure where you are (and what the standard cost of living is), but in Baton Rouge, LA (where I live) your situation is totally doable. 




 Yes.  I've even said, "Y'all have GOT to help me clean.  I'm not doing it all by myself."

That gets them to help some.  But I end up doing 60-70% of it on my own... and I'm one of five people in the house. 




 I make passive-aggressive/guilt-trip statements like, "Man, y'all are messy," "Hey, it'd be awesome if you cleaned," etc.

I even asked my wife this evening (after taking kids home to the dirty house and going back to work for the second part of my day) what she did all day.  "I dunno--hung out.  Why?"  I replied, "I dunno... just thought you'd clean up some or something..."  I got no reply. 




 My problem is that I'm not the one home to get them to clean up after themselves.  I can get them to clean on the weekends SOME, but if my wife would step up and help, it'd be awesome. 









 My wife of 5.5 years and I have a 15yo (step-daughter), 4yo son, and 3yo daughter. I work long hours on weekdays: in by 7:30AM, home by 9:00PM or later. I come home, and there is crap everywhere. It builds and builds until the weekend comes.

I can't relax in a messy house. Dishes (sometimes still with food) in sink, trash all over counters, toys everywhere, etc. I end up cleaning on the weekends because I can't stand it. I make the kids clean their crap (whining about how much it is), ask my wife to help (as she's playing Candy-effing-Crush or Face-effing-book) clean.

Why can't they just clean up their own crap? I spend time cleaning up a house that had literally NO messes made by me. I tried the don't-do-anything-until-they-do-it-themselves trick. That backfired miserably. I had TWO weeks of crap to do.

Case in point: my wife stayed home today with the 15yo who is recovering from a tonsillectomy. I brought the 3yo and 4yo to a sitter. I had hoped she would've cleaned the house, done laundry, done frickin' SOMEthing. NOPE. It eas even MORE messy than when I left this morning. What the hell can I do?

tl;dr - Wife and kids are lazy as hell; they won't clean up; husband/dad does everything after working 14+ work days all week. 




 Either trust her, and let it all go; or don't trust her, and let HER go. 




 So... what are you asking? 




 You probably won't.  Do yourself a favor, and block her. 




 Questions:

1. How old are you and your SO?
2. How long have you been dating?
3. What type of job do you both have?  Is it stable?
4. Are you taking into account the utility deposits (i.e., electricity, water, cable, internet, etc.)?

 Electrical design consultant for architects.  They hire us to design the electrical systems (e.g., lighting, power, HVAC connections, special systems, etc.) and coordinate with the power company.

I get plans in AutoCAD, and select all the lighting, layout all the receptacles, locate security system hardware, locate building-access system hardware, etc. and create the "E"-sheets for the project documents to be constructed from.
