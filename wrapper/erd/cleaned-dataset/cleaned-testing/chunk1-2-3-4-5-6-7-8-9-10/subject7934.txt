How it works: You follow people and places, and they leave messages for you around the city. When you walk near one, you get an alert on your phone. Its like Twitter for your map, with, uh, alerts. Make sense?

Follow lots of people   places (so you can experience the alerts feature), then walk around the city. Weve got a couple of foodies in there, so try following them, or places like Great American Music Hall, Castro Theater, etc, which produce great alerts.
Were really curious to hear feedback. Thanks!

 You know how your dishrags and sponges get slimy after you've used them a while?  That's bacterial build up.  Sterilize them with a 1-2min spin in your microwave on high.  Time varies depending on how strong your microwave oven is, but as long as the sponge is quite hot to the touch and steaming, you've probably killed off ~99% of the nasties.  Enjoy cleaner, fresher smelling and less slimy dishrags.

What would have happened had a camera not fortuitously captured the truth?  Very possibly a completely innocent guy might have not only gone to jail (as he did), but also ended up with a record of assault - against a police officer.  Add to this that they regularly plant drugs to meet quotas.  Yet, in the absence of direct evidence, our judicial system treats their word as incontrovertible.  What will it take to change the presumption that  police are truthful? 




 Cut your lemon in half.  Stick a fork straight into the cut side.  As you're squeezing the lemon, rock the fork back and forth parallel to the line of tines.  This cuts into the flesh of the lemon and breaks it up, releasing more juice than just squeezing it alone.  






































































































































 Here is the interview with Colbert, if you haven't seen it already: http://gawker.com/5855105/stephen-colbert-trolls-occupy-wall-street "I'm a female-bodied person" and other choice quotes in this video.

OWS needs to stay on message and not veer off into weird gender issue language like this girl did.  This is exactly what killed the Left in the 80s.  Let's keep it practical and focused on the economic issues.

**EDIT**: Someone asked "WTF does killed  the left in the 80s refer to?"  

That was the era of Political Correctness - a term they themselves used. I was at Brown at the time. I became disgusted when some of these activists started posting signs on men's bathrooms informing them that "rape is not sex". I'm a guy and used to refer to myself as a feminist. They lost me at that moment. And then minority groups (I am one) started whining about their "subaltern identities". It was absurd, self-absorbed, divisive and just completely repellent to people who weren't crazed ideologues. Rush Limbaugh rose to fame complaining about this stuff. The rest is history.

 Indeed, Israel is far worse. 



















 eval-buffer is an EmacsLisp command. 









  a lot but half of our disappointment in Obama is that things cant get done in the rest of congress.

Lots of stuff he didn't do that he could have done: investigate war crimes, reign in the NSA, directed Holder to prosecute financial crimes instead of drug crimes and copyright "crimes"; he could have appointed someone other than a telecom industry exec to oversee the FCC (who is now predictably dismantling net neutrality) .  Those items, just off the top of my head, demonstrate that Obama is a conservative, like his hero Ronald Reagan.  Now, in terms of policy initiatives, he scuttled the hugely popular public option and universal care behind closed doors with industry execs, and implemented a complex Heritage institute plan that forces us all to be customers of the for-profit insurance industry.

 Hilary is more likely to get congress moving again and you know it

Hillary is more likely to serve monied interests.  That's all she's likely to do (and you know it). 




 Good luck on Hillary doing anything but servicing her lobbyists. 









 Exactly what was said about Obama. 




 Krugman called it: http://consultingbyrpm.com/blog/2009/12/krugman-did-identify-the-housing-bubble-in-2005.html 




 Python, Ruby, Node.js, Objective-C, now looking at Go.

No Haskell/ML ever, apart from casual perusing, I'm afraid. 









 Extensive public record, her research focus as a professor, and of course, major legislation she's sponsored and gotten passed.   




  Sadly, Warren is a two-issue candidate, with those issues being financial reform,  and being a woman who is not Hillary. 

That is just plain wrong.  She's been quite prominent on unions, domestic wiretapping, taxation, education loan reform, workplace safety, civil rights, bankruptcy, corporate power, and energy policy.  

 In 2008 we fielded a candidate with a formidable progressive brand and platform rather than a formidable progressive record.

Warren has an incredible record for her short tenure, unlike Obama. 

And Obama was not a progressive;  he even stated that publicly, saying that his ardent followers were attributing their politics to him incorrectly.  And he proved this in the primaries by supporting telecom immunity (against wiretapping charges) and Joe Lieberman over the progressive Ned Lamont, just to name a couple of issues.  Obama was at best a cypher if you weren't paying attention, but it was actually pretty obvious in the primaries that he was a conservative.  














 Seriously? 









 It's not "moderated down to a level" - it's been censored. 




 Oh dear.  Quite right.  (It's been about 5 years since I used CL.)  It should have been:

     (setf (gethash '= +query-operators+) #'equal-query-op)


*EDIT*: fixed 














 You don't replace mappings in the symbol table - you store mappings in a separate hash-table:

    (defconstant +query-operators+ (make-hash-table))
    (defun equal-query-op (var arg)
       (format nil "~a=~a" var arg))
    (defun not-equal-query-op (var arg)
       (format nil "~a~!=~a" var arg))
    (setf (gethash '= +query-operators+) #'equal-query-op)
    (setf (gethash '!= +query-operators+) #'not-equal-query-op)

Then, you just need a function that takes a list with a query operator as the first element and returns the parameter string:

    (defun query-param (qexp)
       (let ((op (first qexp))
             (op-args (rest qexp)))
          (apply (gethash op +query-operators+) op-args)))

And just map this method over the list:

    (mapcar #'query-param '((= first.name bob) (!= last.name jones)))

Which will yield a list of strings:

    ("first.name=bob" "last.name!=jones")

Which can be concatenated with FORMAT:

    (format nil "~{~a~^ ~}"
            (mapcar #'query-param '((= first.name bob) (!= last.name jones))))

Which gives:

    "first.name=bob last.name!=jones"
            
-----------------------
**EDIT**: fixed bugs (thanks, /u/spacebat) 




  just another downside of attaching healthcare to employment

Yup, Hobby Lobby showed us that. 




 How many different comparison operators do you have?  Is it just != and = or are there more?  

And "name.last!=jones" is valid but odd query syntax.  A typical web framework will pass a parameter named "name.last!" to the handler function.  So how are you going to encode other comparators?

The most straightforward and lispiest way is what someone else here suggested:

(query 'person '((= name.first bob) (!= name.last jones)))

Yes you will need to provide functions to do the conversion of lists into strings.  If you have a small number of operators, honestly an if or cond expression wouldn't be awful.   

Alternatively, you could keep a hash-table that maps the operator symbols (=, !=, etc) to parser functions.  The table would map the equal symbol to the = parser, etc.

Does that make sense? 














  Edit: Just for reference, [here](http://news.investors.com/ibd-editorials-obama-care/120313-681526-cancer-patient-bill-elliott-audited-over-obamacare.htm ) is a story about an unitended effect of the ACA. It just makes me think that the people who supported the ACA didn't actually care enough the effects to do any prior research or put any more work into the bill to ensure this kind of thing didn't happen

Actually, the rightwing outlets reporting this are the ones that didn't do the research.  The story you're referencing is full of holes and untruths.  This has been a pretty common pattern for anti-Obamacare pieces reported on rightwing sites like the one you linked.

 I'm really puzzled by the hate for 47 Ronin.  It received a 13% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes (and was at 0% for top critics).  I really don't understand - it's not the greatest film, but it's certainly very far from the worst.  The visuals are gorgeous, and the script was reasonable - it certainly wasn't insulting like so many others that get much higher marks.  There weren't grating characters, the CGI was deployed tastefully and well done.

 The default orangered upvote count color provided by RES makes Reddit extremely difficult to parse.  The default upvote count draws the eyes away from the title at each line and toward the orangered highlight color at each line.

Compare here: http://imgur.com/a/CEJWX

Orangered is a strong color which Reddit uses to highlight and distinguish noteworthy elements:
   
   * user has upvoted an article
   * user has selected a tab (hot/new/etc)
   * user has new mail

Using orangered for # of upvotes adds a highlight on every line and creates a number of problems:
   
  * confuses the meaning of the highlight color
  * draws attention to a minor detail
  * reduces the readability of the site.  

I initially immediately uninstalled RES because of this particular feature.  I bet many other first-time users have had the same response.  It's worth an A/B test.    (I only kept RES this time after I discovered I could customize it to a neutral color.)

For my two cents, I think the upvote/downvote color should be the same gray color as other elements in that line (#888888), perhaps distinguishing up and downvotes using + and -.  E.g., (+100|-10).  
 






















































 Couple of thoughts:

First some basics: Rice pasta is cheap and ubiquitous.  Rice breads are easy to find too, and not too expensive.  Order burgers with a lettuce wrap.  Rice / asian food is often your friend, but watch out for soy, which often contains gluten, however, you may be able to tolerate in small quantities.  If you're eating sushi, ask for tamari - many sushi places in big cities have this, but you have to ask.

Careful with steroids - oral prednisone  can cause bounce back.  Because your gut is most exposed, you get bounce back in the gut, which can lead to more food allergy.

 Both primitive savage Islamic states and primitive savage Jewish states ought to be isolated. 




 Typical JPost garbage, perfectly illustrates pro-Israeli arguments:  ignore the main issue, the bombing of a densely packed open air prison filled with people whose homes have been stolen, and instead talk about lofty words in Israel's constitution.

This bit was particularly funny.

 "Israel has never had laws that overtly discriminated between citizens on the basis of race."

There are more than 50 Israeli laws that discriminate against Palestinian citizens of Israel in all areas of life, including their rights to political participation, access to land, education, state budget resources, and criminal procedures. Some of the laws also violate the rights of Palestinians living in the 1967 OPT and Palestinian refugees.

  Even if Noam Chomsky is correct, he still sort of comes off as a nutcase.

Seriously, this is totally useless name calling. 

 Chomsky often wanders into these broader schemes that no one can immediately relate to or even imagine.

Have you ever read any of his books, or are you just responding to hearing fragments from him?   If your experience is growing up in the United States over the past 30 years, he's going to sound like an alien from another planet.  But, if that's not the case - you grew up during or before the 70s or were born outside, he's not such a stretch.  In any case, what matters is not the feeling he gives you, but specific cases.  Look into the details.  Chomsky tends to defend his positions with powerful scholarship. 




 Does anyone remember Unclaimed Territory?  I remember thinking that someone had finally come to take the torch from Chomsky.  Greenwald has a different style and his work has a much more journalistic focus, but he reminds me of Chomsky's deconstructive approach, letting establishment figures convict themselves with their own words.  




 These critics feel very emotional about Greenwald, but can do  little other than resort to name calling and unsubstantiated allegations.   




 The people criticizing him for his recent reporting  like Karl Rove's dancing partner, David Gregory, or Jefferey Toobin, believe that the press should only report what the government wants them to.  Were it up to them, Daniel Ellesberg would have been in jail.

 Have you spoken with her? 














 These mendacious hasbara efforts only serve to deepen  disgust for Israeli fascism.  The perception all over the world is that Israel, and Israelis, have turned into monsters, who steal, lie and kill, and then cry that *they* are the victims, even as they bomb the open air prison filled with those whose homes they stole.  Tell me again about those three Israeli kids.  What a joke.  All you are doing is cementing everyone's disgust at this country and its defenders. 




 You'll need a bath after fighting with this Hasbara troll. 




  Unfortunately, come November 2016, barring any "real" choice she will be yet another lesser of two evils.

I'm hoping Warren joins the race.  Without her, I agree, it's looking pretty bleak.

 But, as I said, even Bernie wouldn't criticize Israel.

Disappointing, but such is the culture of fear the Lobby has created.  I can't really blame him or Warren for their votes, though I'm not happy with them. 




 Agree that the Israel lobby holds great sway, however, I don't think Clinton is any way *forced* into the kind of hawkish stance she's taken.  Israel's actions have been decried across the world and are described as war crimes by major human rights organizations, yet not a peep from her about moderation.   

Very few are getting out as far ahead as Clinton is.  No one *forced* make the case for Israel, though they may be forced to take votes for them.  [Clinton is pushing the envelope here,  throwing her support behind far right policies.](http://www.mediaite.com/online/moveon-slams-clinton-for-embracing-policies-of-right-wing-war-hawks/ ).  

I understand you disagree with her statements too, but making excuses for politicians - "everybody's doing it, she has to too" - is really a way of giving cover to odious policies.  And in a small way, contributes to such politicians being able to get away with it.  The "left" in this country spends far too much time negotiating itself out of its own beliefs under the misguided idea that electing conservatives under our own brand counts for something.   The truth is that Clinton is a hawkish globalist, and we ought to be call her out on it. 









 Sell! Sell! 


































 Agree, but, it's one thing to go with the flow, another to bang the drums. 




 This article seems to confirm Hightower's claims:

 The jump in losses was largely due to a $1.5 billion increase in operating expenses as a result of workers compensation payments, the agency said.

 USPS blames much of its financial troubles on a 2006 mandate to stow away billions of dollars for its future retirees' healthcare. The Postal Service already defaulted on three of its payments into the fund and does not expect to make the next $5.7 billion installment due September 30.
 



















 We're in violent agreement. 




 Full text - part 2

Most remarkable of all, Clinton tells Goldberg that, If I were the prime minister of Israel, youre damn right I would expect to have security [control over the West Bank]. What makes this statement so remarkable is that earlier in the interview, Hillary praised the Clinton parameters outlined by her husband in December 2000. Those parameters permit Israeli troops to remain in the Jordan Valley, along the West Banks border with Jordan, for three years. Later in the interview, Clinton claims that she convinced Abbas to agree to allow Israeli troops to remain for six, seven, eight years and that she got Netanyahu to go from forever to 2025 as a date for their withdrawal. Even this, from a Palestinian perspective, represents painful backsliding from the position outlined by Hillarys husband. But as Hillary must know, Bibi three weeks ago said that in light of regional developments, there cannot be a situation, under any agreement, in which we relinquish security control of the territory west of the River Jordan. Which is to say that, as of now, Bibis position really does seem to be forever. Yet rather than challenge that stance, Clinton endorses it. 

Why does Clinton again and again endorse Netanyahus view of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict even when it contradicts long-standing American positions? Because shes so willing to see the world through his eyes. Notice how she begins her statement about security control of the West Bank: If I were the prime minister of Israel. Theres nothing wrong with that. U.S. officials should understand, and empathize with, Israeli leaders, even right-wing ones. But whats missing from Clintons interview is any willingness to do the same for Palestinians. If its so easy to understand why some Israelis might want perpetual military control of the West Bank, why cant Clinton understand why Palestinians - after living for almost fifty years under a foreign army - might not want it to indefinitely patrol their supposedly independent state.

One of the hallmarks of Barack Obamas statements about Israel and Palestine, going back to his 2008 presidential campaign, has been his insistence on giving voice to the fears and aspirations of both sides. Writing about his trip to Israel in The Audacity of Hope, Obama wrote that, I talked to Jews whod lost parents in the Holocaust and brothers in suicide bombings; I heard Palestinians talk of the indignities of checkpoints and reminisce about the land they had lost. In Jerusalem last March, he spoke movingly, and in detail about the Jewish story, but also asked Israelis to put yourself in their [the Palestinians] shoes. Look at the world through their eyes. In her interview with Goldberg, thats exactly what Clinton does not do. Her interpretations of recent Israeli-Palestinian history reflect from a deep imbalance: a willingness to see reality through Israeli eyes and an almost total refusal to do the same for Palestinians.

For far too long, wrote Aaron Miller in 2005, many American officials involved in Arab-Israeli peacemaking, myself included, have acted as Israel's attorney, catering and coordinating with the Israelis at the expense of successful peace negotiations. From the beginning, Barack Obama has tried to avoid that. Although he hasnt brokered Israeli-Palestinian peace, he has tried to make good on his campaign promise to hold up a mirror to both sides. In Hillary Clinton, by contrast, at least judging from her interview on Sunay, Israel has yet another lawyer. And a very good one at that.  




 Full text - part 1

Israels new lawyer: Hillary Clinton

Whos the Israeli governments best spokesperson? Ron Dermer? Michael Oren? Bibi himself? Nope. Its Hillary Clinton. In her interview on Sunday with Jeffrey Goldberg, Clinton offered the most articulate, sophisticated, passionate defense of Netanyahus conduct Ive heard from a government official on either side of the Atlantic. Unfortunately, important chunks of it arent true.

Lets take her claims in turn.

In his first term, Netanyahu moved towards a Palestinian state

Clinton began her defense of Bibi by noting that in his first term, in the late 1990s, he had give[n] up territory and moved in that direction [towards a Palestinian state], as hard as it was.

Thats extremely generous. Its true that in 1997, Bibi withdrew Israeli troops from most of the West Bank city of Hebron (though they can reenter any time Israel wants) and the following year signed the Wye River Accords, under which Israel was supposed to hand over 13 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinian Authority (though Bibis government fell before it could do so).


What Clinton leaves out is that Bibi only agreed to these withdrawals to forestall the far larger ones envisioned under the Oslo Accords he inherited from Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres. In 1993, when Oslo was signed, Bibi publicly compared it to Neville Chamberlains surrender of the Sudetenland to Adolf Hitler.

He accepted Oslo in the 1996 election campaign only because he couldnt repudiate a process endorsed by the Israeli center and championed by the United States. So Bibi sabotaged Oslo by accelerating settlement growth and minimizing the amount of land Israel relinquished. Before I took office, he later boasted, the conception was to give away everything except for two percent [of West Bank] while I turned everything around and gave just two percent to [full control] of the Palestinian Authority. Or as he told settlers after leaving office, I stopped the Oslo Accords. 


The Clinton administration officials who dealt with Bibi in his first term understood this all too well. Neither President Clinton nor Secretary [Madeleine] Albright believed that Bibi had any real interest in pursuing peace, writes Dennis Ross in The Missing Peace. Ross deputy, Aaron Miller, adds in his memoir that, all of us saw Bibi as a kind of speed bump that would have to be negotiated along the way until a new Israeli prime minister came along who was more serious about peace.

Thats a far cry from what Hillary told Goldberg. Then again, Ross and Miller arent running for president.

Bibi agreed to a settlement freeze but Abbas wouldnt negotiate

Fast-forwarding to the Obama years, Clinton claims that, I got Netanyahu to agree to the unprecedented settlement freeze It took me nine months to get Abbas into the negotiations even after we delivered on the settlement freeze.

Whats striking, again, is what Clinton leaves out. The settlement freeze was indeed, unprecedented. Unfortunately, it didnt actually freeze settlement growth. Its not just that, as Clinton admits, the freeze exempted East Jerusalem. Even more importantly, it exempted buildings on which construction had all ready begun. This loophole proved crucial because, as the Israeli press reported at the time, settlers spent the months preceding the freeze feverishly breaking ground on new construction, on which they continued to build during the ten month freeze, before breaking new ground once it expired. As a result, according to Peace Now, there was more new settlement construction in 2010 - the year of the freeze - than in 2008. As Obama administration envoy George Mitchell admitted to Palestinian negotiator Saab Erekat, the Obama administration had wanted a freeze that truly stopped settlement growth but we failed.

Clintons claim that Abbas refused to negotiate until the last minute is disingenuous too. In fact, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators met repeatedly during the freeze. In January 2010, just over a month after it began, veteran Israeli columnist Ben Caspit reported that, In the past weeks, Israeli representatives, including Netanyahu, have repeatedly rejected official documents that their Palestinian counterparts have tried to submit to them, with details of the Palestinian positions on all the core issues. The Israeli representatives are completely unwilling to discuss, read or touch these documents, not to speak of submitting an equivalent Israeli document with the Israeli positions.

While reporting my book, The Crisis of Zionism, I heard four different Obama officials confirm this account. During the settlement freeze, the Palestinians submitted to Netanyahu and his aides the same positions they had submitted to Netanyahus predecessor, Ehud Olmert. These included a Palestinian state on the 1967 lines with a 1.9 percent land swap for territory inside Israel proper, Israeli control of all the Jewish neighborhoods of East Jerusalem, international troops in the Jordan Valley and the return of 150,000 Palestinian refugees over ten years. The Netanyahu government, by contrast, steadfastly refused to discuss the parameters of a Palestinian state.

In her interview with Goldberg, Clinton never mentions that.

Netanyahus views on Palestinian statehood resembled Ehud Baraks.

Given the evidence that during her time as secretary of state, Bibi refused to discuss territory, Clintons claim that I saw Netanyahu move from being against the two-state solution toconsidering all kinds of Barak-like options is bizarre. Whatever you think of Ehud Baraks offer at Camp David in July 2000, it was a detailed offer. Netanyahu, by contrast, refused put forward a territorial proposal not merely during Clintons term, but during John Kerrys far more aggressive effort to broker a deal. During the Kerry negotiations, according to Haaretzs Barak Ravid, Netanyahu flatly refused to present a map or even to discuss the subject theoreticallythroughout the nine months of the talks Netanyahu did not give the slightest hint about the scale of the territorial concessions he would be willing to make.

Its too bad Goldberg didnt press Clinton on what kind of Barak-like options she heard Netanyahu propose, because the best reporting we have suggests he offered no territorial options at all.

Netanyahu is right to demand indefinite control of the West Bank

 














  you're promoting division based on religion.

I think Israel beat us to that one. 




  Jews so special that they're the only nation on earth that isn't allowed to have their own country

The Jews aren't a nation.  They're a religious group.

When religions have their own country, well, we have a word for that.  Pakistan can call itself the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, but it's not recognized as such, rather only as the Republic of Pakistan.  

Official religions and privileged classes are the perfect recipe for failure, such is the case, as we have seen, with Israel. 




 An Israeli Hasbara tactic - frightening your critics into silence. 









 TL;DR.  Without any irony, a Conservative accuses the left of not thinking.

 The whites in South Africa worried about the same thing. 



















 lol 




 The followers of bin Laden are smart enough to know that a military budget requires provisions for both offense and defense.  Funding for defense is in the end a line item on the plus side of the balance sheet, which leaves more room in the budget for weapons.  

It really doesn't matter if you or I see it another way.  The enemies of Israel see us supporting them, and they hate us for it.  If the US were to give $225M for a Palestinian Iron dome too, it would be a different matter. 




  If an ancestors land ownership constitutes the right for a descendent to own it, then the Jews are the oldest group today that can trace itself back to ancient Israel.

 1) Premise/Assumption: Original ownership of land passes to children/grandchildren/so-on.

The Palestinians are the Canaanites who predated the Jews.  

Conclusion:  Palestinians have a claim to ownership of Palestine.

 2) Premise/Assumption: Whoever currently controls a land is the owner.

If that were the case, there should have never been pressure to rid South Africa of its racist regime.  

This premise isn't accepted.

Israel is a defacto Apartheid system, imposed only very recently, and the cause of great instability in the region.  

 3) Premise/Assumption: Controlling a land for 25/50/75/100/200/300/400/ years means that it becomes your land, until another group can hold that land for 25/50/75/100/200/300/400 years.

Again, see the answer to 2).  That is what we are here to discuss.  Land rights.  The Israelis obtained theirs by displacing the people who had lived there for centuries, which is the direct cause for the current problems in the region.  

 




 Why? 




 Truly idiotic. 




 They're only human shields if Israel won't fire on these areas - but Israel *is* willing to fire on these areas, so they're not human shields.

A better explanation is that Hamas militants are using the buildings as cover.  What we can conclude is that *both* Israel and Hamas don't care about civilian casualties. 




 Both historically and recently, they have the antecedent claim to the land.   




 from [Osama bin Laden's 'letter to America'](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/nov/24/theobserver )

 (Q1) Why are we fighting and opposing you? 

 (1) Because you attacked us and continue to attack us.

 a) You attacked us in Palestine:

 (i) Palestine, which has sunk under military occupation for more than 80 years. The British handed over Palestine, with your help and your support, to the Jews, who have occupied it for more than 50 years; years overflowing with oppression, tyranny, crimes, killing, expulsion, destruction and devastation. The creation and continuation of Israel is one of the greatest crimes, and you are the leaders of its criminals. And of course there is no need to explain and prove the degree of American support for Israel. The creation of Israel is a crime which must be erased. Each and every person whose hands have become polluted in the contribution towards this crime must pay its*price, and pay for it heavily.

 (Q2) What are we calling you to, and what do we want from you?

 The American people are the ones who pay the taxes which fund the planes that bomb us in Afghanistan, the tanks that strike and destroy our homes in Palestine, the armies which occupy our lands in the Arabian Gulf, and the fleets which ensure the blockade of Iraq. These tax dollars are given to Israel for it to continue to attack us and penetrate our lands. So the American people are the ones who fund the attacks against us, and they are the ones who oversee the expenditure of these monies in the way they wish, through their elected candidates. 









 You realize that only a few decades ago, terrorist attacks against Americans were completely unthinkable.  That was before our interventionist foreign policy, and when we were seen as a neutral broker in the Middle East.

 What you're advocating is giving money directly to the .001%.  That will line their pockets, not help everyone else.  Corporations aren't struggling because there isn't capital floating around.  Remember the billions that we gave to the banks?  Or all that money that rich people already have?  

The problem is that regular people don't have money.  Giving it straight to corporations is just going to make things worse.

 




 That is really depressing.  If she sincerely believes in it, that's almost enough to make me write her off.  I hope this is just a political calculation.

So for now, I'm going to assume this is a matter of picking battles.

 The presence of Israel on the holy sites is one of the prime recruiting reasons for radical Islamists.  

The bigger problem is that the US wants control of the region.  Israel is out proxy there.  And that's the reason OP's post will only be a wild pipe dream - that is, until regional oil supplies are no longer important. 









 That's why the blockade has been condemned by the UN and several human rights organizations.  But, in the Orwellian world of the hasbara activist, the Israeli imposed Palestinian "diet" is a great, generous humanitarian act.  

Good grief. 




 The check for your hasbara services is in the mail. 




 I have no idea what any of this is about.   









  Hamass can stop hiding among and behind women and children any time they want, but they do not. 

Hamas has been accused of using human shields, but this only works if the opponent cares about civilian casualties.  Obviously, Israel does not.  

 Hamas bears much of the blame for this violence. They have been preparing for it for some time given the complexity of tunnel networks.

Is see, some of the individuals of the open air prison have rebelled.  Since we've already accepted that collective punishment is an acceptable approach, might as well kill prisoners arbitrarily, right, whether they were involved or not.  Hopefully they will learn to cower before their masters,  the thieves who stole their ancestral properties, once enough of their children are dead.   

 They were elected to lead, and instead of building schools, infrastructure, and bettering the lives of civilians; they build missiles, bombs, suicide vests, and tunnels.

LOL.  Let's ignore the fact that the Israeli government blocked supplies to the open air prison after Hamas won the vote, right?  Or as that senior Israeli official described it:  "**[The idea is to put the Palestinians on a diet, but not to make them die of hunger.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dov_Weissglass )**"

Fucking evil genocidal sacks of shit.  But the world is starting to learn the truth, despite the best efforts at selective story-telling by the hasbara brigade.  Israel is being seen for what it is - the Nazi's Frankenstein monster - and world public opinion is repudiating it.   




 Responding by killing over a thousand Palestinians = "getting a pass".

  The Shah of Iran hates us for our actions in 1953, nothing to do with Israel. 

The Shah of Iran, Reza Pahlavi, was a close ally of the United States.  His secret police, SAVAK, were notorious for disappearing and torturing his opponents.

[Saddam was a US ally, as was Osama bin Laden.](http://www.juancole.com/2005/08/fisking-war-on-terror-once-upon-time.html )

The point is that our support for Israel is just one aspect of our  meddling in the Middle East.  It has produced negative consequences for us.  At one time, it was unthinkable that the US would be the target of terrorist attacks.  It was seen as a fair and unbiased actor in the region.  However, after years of self-interested intervention, as the CIA warned, we're experiencing blowback.

**EDIT** grammar 




 Our support over the years of Israel and other brutal regimes in the region - Shah of Iran, Saddam, the Saudi dictatorship - is the #1 reason cited by leaders of anti-US groups like Al Qaeda for their actions against us. 

I think you're vastly underestimating the cost of our support for Israel. 




 As a Canadian, I second the sentiment.

  We also did a "regime change" in Serbia/Kosovo, and there's not "brutal chaos" there.

That is a valid argument.

 It's no small coincidence that the US is more active in more volatile parts of the world and that volatile parts of the world are more likely to descend into chaos.

1. But if the US tends not to be successful in interventions, we should tend not waste blood and treasure by intervening.
2. In some of the cases (e.g., Iraq), the regions are unstable because of previous US interference (i.e., CIA/Mossadegh).

logical fallacy

**EDIT** For all the down voters - do you understand what a [logical fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_fallacy ) is?

This argument has the structure:

1. ALL P ARE Q

2. Q

3. THEREFORE Q MUST BE A P

4. BUT Q IS NOT A P, THEREFORE (1) IS FALSE

I.e.,  an invalid argument - a classical logical fallacy.

Translating, Sleekery is arguing:

1. All countries which the US regime changed (P) are countries which descended into chaos (Q)

2. Syria descended into chaos

3. Therefore Syria must be a country which the US invaded

4. But Syria wasn't invaded by the US, therefore (1) must be false...

An invalid argument.

 I don't believe that the entire Progressive caucus supports this, rather I read this as abject cowardice. AIPAC has a stranglehold over our politics, and even the most stalwart progressives can't say a peep about it.

 No, I agree that is pretty clearly biased. 

Yet, a lot of this article rung true to me.  I think Clinton, if elected President, will be a disaster for progressives.  I've heard nothing out of her mouth that I believe.  Even when she talked about income inequality recently at the Aspen Ideas conference, it sounded like she was bullshitting.  She so carefully couched her words that it seemed like a nod and a wink to her fellow globalists: "just what the proles want to hear, don't you know".  That has been my impression, anyway.

 "Spitzer". 




  Hobby Lobby did not object to covering typical "birth control," and, if I'm reading this decision correctly, is not exempt from covering combined oral contraceptives (i.e., the medication that nigh everyone thinks of when you say "birth control").

 To that end, I'm sorry to say, I think Sen. Warren is being disingenuous, as is any reporter/opinion writer that implies that this case applies to a broader scope than written.

You are wrong:  [the SCOTUS clarified *the very next day* that the decision applies broadly to the entire contraceptive mandate, not just the handful of methods that Hobby Lobby objected to](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/scotus-says-hobby-lobby-ruling-applies-broadly ).  

Even without this, why would you think Warren is being disingenuous when she is merely echoing the ideas in Ginsburg's dissent?  We should be thankful for her voice on this issue. 

 The privately traded company Hobby Lobby is wholly owned by devoutly religious peoples, and therefore should have access to the same exemptions as other religious employers.

Under this theory, companies owned by religious people are indistinguishable from religious institutions, so shouldn't have to pay any tax at all.  But that is obviously false.  Religious institutions and charities are categorically different from corporate employers, which is why we treat them as such everywhere in US law.   HSS did not open the door to anything.







 




 What exactly are you remembering?  Obama was an extremely lackluster Senator. [An assessment by 7 liberal interest groups ranked him as among the least liberal"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_career_of_Barack_Obama#Legislation_and_voting_record ).  Warren is already a huge force in the Senate - so much so that some progressives mistakenly argue that "we need her to continue doing what she's doing in the Senate".  Not so for Obama, that's for sure -- what exactly did he do?  

I remember quite well because a very close friend of mine was an ardent supporter of his.  At that time, I was following Obama's record quite closely.  And another friend, an African-American lawyer who was at Harvard Law a few years after Obama,  also followed his career closely.  There was *very* little in the way of actual legislative achievements to indicate his governing style.  The one thing of note was that Obama would do a good job of explaining each side's arguments - at Harvard Law school and in Illinois - and that was his great strength, expressing the interests of both sides of the argument.  His whole life has been about playing the middle.  If you think he was some great success in the Senate, you ought to supply some data.

  




 Right - it has nothing to do with Eric Holder putting [this asshole](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/03/29/lanny-breuer-and-the-immorality-of-our-morality.html) in charge of bank fraud:

 Breuer expressed his prosecutorial philosophy thus: "In reaching every charging decision, we must take into account the effect of an indictment on innocent employees and shareholders," Breuer said. "Those are the kinds of considerations in white-collar crime cases that literally keep me up at night and which must play a role in responsible enforcement."

... before he left for a $4M a year job working for banks.
 




 The problem is people weren't paying attention: telecom immunity, supporting Joe Lieberman over Ned Lamont, "Reagan is the model president", and "American needs bipartisanship" - were all pretty clear signals about what kind of President Obama was going to be.

Warren has been spent her whole career actually  fighting for the issues she's stumping about.  Not so Obama. 




 Who is Eliot? 




 What's annoying is that people aren't paying attention to the details.  Obama's message was that bipartisanship was the answer, and Reagan was the president he'd emulate.  Warren has been writing and testifying about income inequality from before she got into politics. 




 Obama has governed very conservatively, and there was every indication he was going to do that in the primaries.  Not so for Warren. 




  You're 100% right, Warren does not have an outstanding voting record (just like Obama).

This is totally wrong. 




 Obama had no track record of doing anything progressive.  His core message was about bipartisanship ("one America, not two", remember?) - this is why I was never a fan of his.  He showed he was a conservative during the primaries -- he supported telecom immunity; supported Joe Lieberman over the excellent progressive, Ned Lamont; praised Reagan as a model president; there were several actions like this that showed he would govern as a conservative.  He even stated that his supporters ascribed their own politics to him, though he was more conservative than they thought.

But... you have to pay attention to the details.  If you don't, you're likely to reach the conclusion that "everything is the same".  But it's not - what did Obama actually achieve before he was elected?  Nothing.  What did he actually fight for?  Nothing - he gave a pretty speech at the convention about the need for bipartisanship.  It was clear what we were electing. 




 We ended up coding Twitter/FB shares using just the libraries provided by them/iOS Apis  




 I spent so much time trying to get ShareKit to work - it's really a huge disaster.  The approach seems to be super-aggressive on releasing auth credentials.  What this means is, if you rely on Facebook auth as a means for being logged in to your own app, simply by doing a ShareKit share, the user can be logged out of your own app  

I tried pointing this out to the maintainers, and issued patches, but they didn't accept them.  There are several other problems.  Even though it seems to have a lot of integrations, it's really not worth the trouble, in my experience.   




 [Ginsburg talks about exactly this issue in her dissent.] (http://www.newsday.com/opinion/columnists/anne-michaud/the-murky-hobby-lobby-decision-anne-michaud-1.8823229) Hobby Lobby is refusing to pay for IUDs, which can cost a month's wages.  Ginsburg argues that the employers are effectively *preventing* any use of that form of birth control for their employees.  

If members of SCOTUS are saying this, I think Warren is on pretty solid ground.

On another note, it seems that progressives have been fighting losing battles when they second guess themselves and pull their punches.  I'd say that the complaints you have against her are exactly the reason she's ought to lead the party --- she puts the progressive argument on an offensive stance.  (And she's right).  That's how we're going to win battles going forward, not hedging and qualifying things as though we're in philosophy class.

Obama's picks in those posts have dropped the ball.  Warren has brought legislation and publicly shamed the regulators.  What else can she do in her position? 




 It would be much better if everyone were quiet and let both parties do the bidding of Wall Street in peace, right?   Good thinking!

 Are you saying that monopsonies are ok?  It's uncontroversial (i.e., it's taught in first year economics) that monopsonies don't allocate resources efficiently.  Here's a [primer](http://www.amosweb.com/cgi-bin/awb_nav.pl?s=wpd c=dsp k=monopsony,+efficiency ).

 




 He addresses that, doesn't he?

 Which brings us back to the key question. Dont tell me that Amazon is giving consumers what they want, or that it has earned its position. What matters is whether it has too much power, and is abusing that power. Well, it does, and it is. 



















 [Krugman talks about that here](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/03/opinion/krugman-not-enough-inflation.html):

 Why is low inflation a problem? One answer is that it discourages borrowing and spending and encourages sitting on cash. Since our biggest economic problem is an overall lack of demand, falling inflation makes that problem worse.

 Low inflation also makes it harder to pay down debt, worsening the private-sector debt troubles that are a main reason overall demand is too low.

 **So why is inflation falling? The answer is the economys persistent weakness, which keeps workers from bargaining for higher wages and forces many businesses to cut prices.** And if you think about it for a minute, you realize that this is a vicious circle, in which a weak economy leads to too-low inflation, which perpetuates the economys weakness.

 




 Warren is arguably one of them.  Not sure how much progress she can make by herself.  The conversation needs to change.  I think that's what she's trying to force the Ds to do.  (Focus on core economic issues, not distract people with social ones, like the Clintons/Obama). 




 Which would include almost all Republicans and Democrats, and certainly our soon-to-be Queen Hillary. 




 Because Republicans don't want to talk about [this](http://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/2jrpsa/this_year_an_analysis_by_the_new_york_times_shows/ ). 




 The [original paper](http://www.bostonfed.org/inequality2014/papers/reeves-sawhill.pdf ) has much better data (see Figures 10   11).  This chart the WaPo concocted is meaningless and poorly interpreted. 

 




 Yeh, it's pretty clear that both parties are doing it.  The Democrats have been taken over by carpet bagging globalists like the Clintons who get the votes of the rank-and-file by pushing left wing social issues.  The Republicans have always catered to the rich and sell their message using (now discredited) trickle down economics and right wing social issues.

So it could be argued that Warren is incorrect and just banging the partisan drums.  However, an alternative view  is that she's repositioning and rebranding the Democratic party - away from the ideas of Clinton/Obama and towards *economic* left wing issues.  Speeches like this make it harder for Clinton to maneuver.  If Democrats are supposed to be unrigging the system, it'll make it uncomfortable for Clinton to say things like ["lobbyists are people too"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaAkcXynqLA).  

The question is - could Warren just be honest and start attacking half the Democratic party as out of touch and beholden to Wall Street interests?  That would be the truth.  Why did Obama keep the roster of Rubinites and banker-apologists in power at Justice, the SEC and Treasury?   We already know that Warren dislikes them - she's been directly opposed to many of the policies they've instituted.  

There are essentially two choices: call out conservative Democrats and split the party in two, or attract a following and side line them.  Warren is clearly choosing the latter, and I think it's the right choice.  Nader, as much as I agree with him, took the first road, and look where that got him. 



















 The mishmash graphic that WaPo created and what they're trying to assert is in fact wrong, as you point out... which makes the title (sorry, verbatim copy) wrong as well.

However, take a look at the [original paper](http://www.bostonfed.org/inequality2014/papers/reeves-sawhill.pdf), and a couple of the key charts:

* [High school dropout 40-year income quintile versus income quintile at birth]( http://i.imgur.com/N8KCdUM.png)

* [College grad 40-year income quintile versus income quintile at birth](http://i.imgur.com/WUaCyEE.png)

 




 [Original paper](http://www.bostonfed.org/inequality2014/papers/reeves-sawhill.pdf).

[High school dropout 40-year income quintile versus income quintile at birth]( http://i.imgur.com/N8KCdUM.png)

[College grad 40-year income quintile versus income quintile at birth](http://i.imgur.com/WUaCyEE.png) 









 You know what, I think you are reading the graphic correctly and I was reading it incorrectly.  So, it's true that poor college grads end up in the top two quintiles 40% of the time, whereas rich drop outs end up in the top two quintiles 19% of the time.  

Why the hell did they include the left axis?  That is so damn confusing.

But as I said, this is a terrible comparison anyway.  The actual published charts tell the story much more clearly.  It's hard to argue with Figures [10](http://i.imgur.com/N8KCdUM.png) and [11](http://i.imgur.com/WUaCyEE.png).  

Poor drop outs are 3.4 times more likely to end up in the bottom quintile (Figure 10).  Meanwhile, poor college grads are just over half as likely to end up in the top quintile compared to rich college grads.  That doesn't sound like a meritocracy, does it?

 




 **EDIT** Realized I'm *totally* wrong about this.  See [my comment later in this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/2josjx/poor_kids_who_do_everything_right_dont_do_better/cldtuef ).

- - - - - -
That commenter has simply misread the graphic. Specifically 19% of rich high school dropouts are not in the top **40%** (as claimed), rather *they are in the top* **20%**.  

On top of this, only 20% of poor college grads make it to the top 20%.  

I.e., *a rich high school dropout has as much of a chance of getting to the top 20% as a poor guy who slogged through college.*

Now, I'll grant that this is a pretty crappy chart, but it seems to have been cobbled together by WaPo.  For a more informative view of the data, take a look at [figures 10](http://i.imgur.com/N8KCdUM.png ) and [figure 11](http://i.imgur.com/WUaCyEE.png ) in [the original paper](http://www.bostonfed.org/inequality2014/papers/reeves-sawhill.pdf ).

Pretty clearly, being a rich goof is better than being a diligent poor.

 **Submission Statement**

This is an interview with the author of a new book on the food industry: "The Spam Factory's Dirty Secret".  Although this doesn't go into depth on the origins of the disease the factory workers experience, it made me wonder --- could this be a porcine-form of Creutzfeld-Jakob/bovine spongiform encephelopathy aka mad cow disease?  It's horrifying that this might be transmitted through the misty of brain particles the workers are exposed to on a daily basis. 









 Au contraire - in fact, the author is quite liberal, and once wrote a column which appeared in WaPo during the Bush years called "White House Watch".  It so pissed off the Neocon editorial staff there that [the WaPo ombudsman was forced to address the controversy](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/10/AR2005121000938.html ):

 PS; DR. 




 The title says "separate system", but my actual proposal is only for a special prosecutor.   That's a well-accepted way of dealing with conflict-of-interest situations in our judicial system. 




 You should read beyond the title. 




 Point taken.  See my edit in the self post. 




 **EDIT** [madronedorf](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/2ijqtx/there_needs_to_be_a_separate_system_of_justice/cl2vauy ) points out I did a pretty crappy job with the title.  I should have written **"There needs to be a special prosecutor for police misconduct"**.

---
The outcome many expected - [no charges for anyone in the SWAT team that blew a hole in a baby with a flash bang](http://www.ajc.com/news/news/breaking-news/no-charges-for-officers-in-botched-drug-raid-that-/nhc2N/?__federated=1 ) - has come to pass.  I know many people are angry seeing cops commit horrific crimes and get away with no charges again and again.  Yet, though this issue is  finally starting to get coverage in the wider media, few speak about one of the most obvious causes of the problem.

Our current system requires that police are prosecuted by people who are essentially their colleagues.  Prosecutors rely on the testimony and cooperation of the police, so they have a strong motivation, if they want success and good relations with them in the future, to find reasons not to prosecute what are obviously crimes.  This   conflict of interest, has resulted in a lack of accountability which has allowed police culture to evolve in an increasingly violent direction.

Police brutality is a symptom of a structural problem.  Getting angry and demanding an end to bad police behavior, or demanding that police be prosecuted for one or another particularly horrendous beating, torture or murder won't solve the problem in the future.  We can't demand that the special relationship between prosecutors and police just magically go away.  It can't if they are to be effective at doing their jobs.  

The only solution, it seems, is to delegate independent prosecutors who are tasked solely with prosecuting police.  What do you think of this? Is there enough work for each state to have their own police prosecutor, or are there reasons for this function to be kept at the Federal level.  Who would this office report to to avoid political pressure being used to neuter the office?

 Signing statements are but one aspect of executive power.

But still, I am wrong and you are right.  Obama has used executive *orders* less than Bush.  

Yet, EOs have been declining steadily since at least Jimmy Carter (contrary to what all of us  in this thread probably suspected):  http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/07/10/how-obama-has-used-executive-powers-compared-to-his-predecessors/
 




  hey say "oh, the last person did it, so our guy can do it!" that's not how justice works.

I could not agree more.  I've totally lost respect for Ds who went silent on Obama after criticizing Bush on the exact same issues.  

 I agree, but i honestly think it's both sides

On issues of secrecy, surveillance and executive power, both sides are equally bad.  Obama is arguably worse on all of these issues, having expanded the Cheney doctrine (which the Neocons have gleefully complimented him on).  However, if we're talking about economic issues, the Democrats are very slightly better.    If we're talking about social issues, the Democrats win hands down.  If we're talking about the base, the Democrats have a feeble bunch of half-hearted partisans who are largely rational and have most of the very tiny number of rational unbiased voters, whereas the Republicans have a bunch of super passionate batshit-crazy partisans.  









 Actually, I agree, he's pretty bad, even worse than Bush on some issues (executive power, surveillance, at al).  But boy are conservative complainers a bunch of hypocrites. 









 A quick guide to the Obama scandals:
http://i.imgur.com/aWqDFPZ.jpg 




 OMG that video was excellent.  Now I understand. 




 Honestly cannot tell whether sarcasm or actual wingnut rant.
 




 Terrific analysis.  I hadn't heard that before. 




 I know some like that too, and don't have a ton of sympathy for them.  But I think it's important to look at the big picture.  At the macro level  the middle class is working harder, longer hours, being more productive, and getting paid less.  George Bush said it well when [he complimented a woman on having 3 jobs]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIjo-dWE1Jg ).  "That is uniquely American, isn't it?"

Well, the truth is that it's the *modern* American condition, what we've been left with - two parents having to work just to make ends meet - while the tiny sliver at the top take all the societal gains.. Those few at the top with vast wealth, much of it inherited, can fail their way through life and still land on top because of the structure of modern capitalism.  Owning capital means you get rewarded with profit on work someone else did.  And our society is increasingly becoming one where it pays better to own than work.   




 Thank you so much for that.  This was driving me bananas. 




 Thank you for that response. Could you elaborate on Krugman saying individuals ought not to own capital? I've never heard that from him... honestly, that would surprise me a bit.

I read the Murphy piece, but I'm a bit skeptical.  He seems to be driving at his conclusions because he's upset at Piketty's conclusions, not because of analysis.  Giles, on the other hand, certainly seemed to have an analysis.  I thought his conclusions were pretty damning when they came out, but they have since been pretty thoroughly and humiliatingly debunked (even by the very authors he quoted).  The other main criticism is that Piketty got depreciation rates wrong, but Delong deals with that issue [here](http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2014/06/over-at-equitable-growth-depreciation-rates-on-wealth-in-thomas-pikettys-database-monday-focus-june-9-2014.html ). 




 While I agree with you on the micro-scale, at the macro scale we're facing  an economy of increasing automation, which is obviating the need for jobs.  CPG Grey made a good video that explains: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU.  The only people that stand to win in such an economy are the ones who own the robots, so to speak.  We're seeing the beginnings of this transition today.  

As labor becomes unnecessary, the bargaining power of workers falls.  People aren't lazier than they were before -- they're more productive, work longer hours, have poorer health, and less free time -- but they get paid less.  The richest family in America can pay workers so little they have to rely on government assistance to get by, at the same time their company makes vast profits.  Such is the benefit of inherited wealth.

In the world we're moving into, those  who own the means of production and distribution have increasingly greater bargaining power and extract more value from labor contracts.  Workers work harder, produce goods more efficiently, and because of their efficiency put themselves out of jobs, and because of their weaker bargaining power,  share in less and less of the wealth.  

This mirrors the finding of Piketty et al., who I'm sure you've heard of if you are hanging out on Reddit frequently.  His work conclusively demonstrates that in aggregate, and increasingly so, you become wealthier simply by owning capital, whereas on average you become poorer if your income derives primarily from doing work.

 I don't think it's just a matter of moving the debate to the left.  Hillary will tell people what they want to hear (like Obama did), and then govern like the carpetbagging globalist she is.  We someone who is going to represent the issues of regular people like Sanders or Warren.  Anything else is a failure. 




 What he's doing is establishing the grounds for debate: here are the important issues, this is what the American people care about.  He needs to make that message ring clear, then he can go in and dismantle her during the debates and the main campaign.

If he attacks her too soon, he's tacitly acknowledging her leadership status in the race (even though she hasn't announced), which gives her some free credibility.  And if he attacks now without establishing the grounds for debate, he'll do so from a weaker position, and will run the risk of inoculating her from those arguments later in the campaign. 



















 See my reply [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/2fwktm/senator_elizabeth_warren_delivered_a_speech_on/ckdoy3a ). 




 Yet, SCOTUS ruled that the government also has an interest in safeguarding the integrity of the electoral process.  The Constitution has conflicting goals which need to be balanced with one another.  The purpose of these amendments is to preserve a government by and of the people.   Yet, as we know from the recent Princeton study, the US is now effectively an oligarchy. 

So some balance is needed.  It won't come from the Supreme Court, which is the most corporate-friendly in history, which has overturned precedent and rejected the laws which our *elected representatives* have passed.  Their actions have made a new amendment necessary.
 









 First amendment?    

 "While money is used to finance speech, [money is not speech](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/former-justice-stevens-campaign-money-isnt-speech/ ) . Speech is only one of the activities that are financed by campaign contributions and expenditures. Those financial activities should not receive precisely the same constitutional protections as speech itself,. After all, campaign funds were used to finance the Watergate burglary, actions that clearly were not protected by the First Amendment."

 That code was a joke, but, having worked on several different reasoning systems, I don't see how any of them could ever be considered conscious.   

 No not at all, considering we are a few pounds of soft grey spongy material. 

But it's not clear what kind of physics is going on in there.  (And no, I don't believe in Hameroff's microtubule nonsense).  

What is clear, however, is that any of the most sophisticated AI reasoners that you could run on the fastest digital computer around today could also run on this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40DkJ9vt5CI (Please watch) - where the physics is clear, and obviously doesn't invoke consciousness.  To say that thing is conscious just doesn't pass the giggle test.  

Have you read Chalmer's essay on the  [Hard and Easy problem](http://consc.net/papers/facing.html )? 




  Still, this is kind of how research works, people have experimented on animals capable of pain, even giving rats cancer to find ways of treating cancer, in the long run that benefits humanity.

But computers aren't conscious. 




 Here's an AI that's begging you to stop experimenting on it:

    def do_experiment():
        print("Please stop experimenting on me.")

     do_experiment()
    Please stop experimenting on me.


The question revolves around whether it is possible to hurt an AI and whether AIs have any subjective sensation.  I think we can agree that in the above case it doesn't.  So the real question is, when does an AI experience anything?  

The things that we call computers today are Turing equivalent.  That is, any one device could simulate any other Turing-equivalent device.  That means that [a machine like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40DkJ9vt5CI) could, given enough time (and tape), run any fancy AI program we dream up.  I think it strains credibility to think such a machine could ever be conscious, or that we should ever care about its suffering.  Don't you agree?

 "If only they would comply with the ethnic cleansing program." 




 So satisfying.  Thanks.  Funnily enough, I just posted yesterday about [UCLA's mechanical calculator](http://vimeo.com/70589461 ). 














 The machine's states are governed by the positions of the white flaps that are attached to a bar at the top of the machine.  Call this the "state bar".  Balls collected from the front are dropped onto the state bar.  If the bar drops onto a state flap, it rotates the bar, effectively changing the state.

Notice that the ball is picked up from one of 5 positions in front of the machine.  Each of these positions represents a Symbol; call them B1...B5.  When a ball is picked up from position ***i***, it is dropped onto the state flap in position ***i***.  Depending on the position of the state bar, the flap at position ***i*** may be in the way.  If the bar has 2 rotational positions, then the machine has 2 states, which we'll call S1 and S2. 

Thus, the rules are encoded by positioning flaps at positions 1,2,3,4,5 (corresponding to symbols B1...B5).

E.g.,

| states/positions | 1 | 2  |  3 |  4 |  5 |
| ----------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---: |
|  S1  | 0 | 1  |  0 |  1 |  0 |
|  S2  | 1 | 0  |  1 |  0 |  1 |

In this rule system, B2 and B4 cause S1-S2 transition whereas B1,B3 and B5 cause S2-S1.

This is just an example of how to write  rules.   (I'm not making any claims about whether this is Turing complete.)


 




 Watch the whole video. 









 Here's an actual mechanical Turing machine (bonus points: no electricity required!).

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40DkJ9vt5CI#t=13 














 It looks like a continuous mechanical calculator, doesn't it? 









 There is no agency. A computer is a simple mechanism, and can be implemented using very different components:

  * electronic (the kind you're using now)
  * [mechanical](http://hackaday.com/2011/03/25/mechanical-turing-machine-can-compute-anything-slowly/ )
  * [water and valves](http://www.inquisition.ca/en/info/artic/ordineau.htm )
  
When arranged in the right way, such parts can "compute" when a motor is run.  In the case of electronic computers, the motor is an electronic clock which causes the computer to advance from one step of a computation to another.  For a mechanical computer, a real motor does the job.  

In fact, it doesn't matter what the parts are -- computers are said to be "equivalent" to each other --- i.e., any program you can describe in the most sophisticated modern electronic computer could be run (albeit slowly) on a mechanical or water-valve-based computer.  

Think of a computer as a player piano which interprets a line of the piano roll differently depending on what keys are currently pressed, and which is capable of modifying the roll (adding or deleting holes) and moving it back and forth.  The only thing that is required is an external source of energy to drive it through its paces.  As I said above, in a modern computer, an electronic clock plays this role of stepping transistors through their paces, but the principle is the same.

The mathematician Alan Turing described the first general purpose computer, and that machine was capable of doing all of the computations of any modern day computer. Checkout the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40DkJ9vt5CI#t=13 ) in the "mechanical" link above.  Just pause and soak that in for a moment - that primitive device (given enough tape) is capable of doing any computation your fancy 2014 laptop is.

For that reason we call general purpose computers "Turing-complete".  They are all equivalent to each other in terms of the computations they can do. The only difference is that modern ones are smaller and faster, and have better input-output capabilities.  But  from a mathematical perspective, Turing's original "a-machine" was just as powerful.  In fact, the Turing machine in the video is capable of *simulating* the CPU in your laptop.  Pretty mind-blowing, huh?

Turing's machine was based on a pretty simple mechanism which had 6 states and wrote 2 symbols.  Yet, [even simpler mechanisms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfram%27s_2-state_3-symbol_Turing_machine ) have been described.  So Turing completeness is pretty easy to create.  People have even created Turing-complete computers inside virtual worlds [like Minecraft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X21HQphy6I ).   Given enough memory and time, they're just as capable as the most powerful super computer available today.

So how to computers appear to think and have agency?  All the magic happens in programs. Programs cause computing machines  to move from state to state and read and write symbols as it does so.  We interpret the output as the results of the computation.  

I highly recommend Martin Davis's  excellent book on the origins of computing called ["The Universal Computer"](http://www.amazon.com/The-Universal-Computer-Leibniz-Turing/dp/0393047857 ) for a great explanation of how questions about the foundations of mathematics gave rise to modern computing.

 No, I think that there's a clear conflict of interest to have prosecutors prosecuting their policeman colleagues, whatever the race of the victim and policeman.   In this case, the black officer got off for the same reason that Darren Wilson did.  In both cases, it needs to stop.  We need to eliminate this glaring conflict of interest.

My comment about "McCulloch, the white colleague of the predominantly white, and at least partly racist, police force" was a retort to captrockwelltorrey, who implied that because McCulloch is a Democrat, that somehow exonerates him of favoring the police officer in the Wilson/Brown case.  I was merely pointing out that while McCulloch might be a Democrat, one could make the (equally non-sequiturial) counter-argument that he's white.  I might have more clearly stated my objection with "WTF does him being a Democrat have to do with anything??"  Anyway, that is what I meant.

    Black: 21.71%

That is racism.  The fact that you aren't convinced says more about your disposition than about the facts.
 




 Because there is a news article documenting each racist cop in Ferguson, right? 




 These statistics demonstrate things pretty convincingly, but I'm sure you'll still be unconvinced.

  and at least partly racist, police force,

[Officer Dan Page](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/08/more-audio-surfaces-dan-page-racist-rant-end-times )


 So your argument here boils down to "Racist white people" and "Conspiracy"?

WTF?

 




 To the contrary, McCulloch, the white colleague of the predominantly white, and at least partly racist, police force, betrayed his role as prosecutor, which is to present a case which argues for trial.  In fact, [almost *all* grand juries decide to indict, except when the defendant is a police officer](http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/ferguson-michael-brown-indictment-darren-wilson/ ).  That's not some strange statistical coincidence - it's the expected, obvious outcome when cops are prosecuted by their direct colleagues.   





























 This is true for almost every article on the NYTimes.  Once you reach the limit of articles for the month, you can't read more unless you put your browser in "private" mode.   


Everyone left Slashdot  precisely because of over-zealous moderation, and it's ruining the experience here too. 




 So r/politics has gotten to the point of blocking the NYTimes now too? 




  doesn't that indicate to you - as an attorney - that the evidence that the officer did anything culpably wrong was essentially non-existent?

No.  When the defendant is an officer of the law, grand juries frequently *fail* to indict, unlike what happens with everyone else.  So, what happened in this case is  the rule, not the exception.  Regular people go to court, officers get off:
http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/ferguson-michael-brown-indictment-darren-wilson/ 

The obvious explanation is that the massive conflict of interest in having your colleague frame the case for your grand jury is producing the expected result.  And that's why there's so much furor over this case --- everyone knows that officers aren't accountable to the law.  

 
























 Are Christians more violent than Muslims?  [What do the statistics say?](https://abagond.wordpress.com/2013/04/24/are-christians-more-violent-than-muslims/ ) 









 If I understand correctly, you're proposing to use charitable donations essentially as a form of brand advertising.

The question you should ask is: what are your goals?  Are you trying enhance your brand's reputation?  Or do you need to boost short term sales?  Charity is pretty much guaranteed to perform worse for the second purpose.  As an entrepreneur, you understand that resources are limited, and your route to success depends on getting maximum ROI.  

Are you sure your business is at a point where building brand value is more important than expanding the business or boosting sales?  It all depends on the growth profile of your business, and how much brand value is important, and how much giving to a particular charity can improve that.

If you decide in the affirmative, I'd look at this as a kind of advertising campaign.  Will the charity give your business exposure to the right audience?  Will you get constant exposure, or a one-time promotion?  How many eyeballs will you reach?  Over what time?  What are the demographics of the people who will be exposed to the message about your support?  Will they understand what your company does and why they might be interested in the product?  How will you measure success?  What metric will you use to decide to continue the campaign or not?  How long do you have to run the campaign to see the result?  

Long running brand awareness campaigns, are harder things to measure than more focused forms of advertising.  20% is a healthy chunk of profits - I don't have figures, but I'd hazard a guess that this level of spending on charity is extremely rare.  Why do you think that is?  My guess is that the market is doing ROI calculations - large businesses with excess cash can afford to spend what to them are small amounts to get a large outcome in terms of brand perception.   My guess is that you're running a relatively small business, so you're going to be spending a lot more, and getting less of the charity's promotional efforts.  Probably not a good deal.

Now, there are probably some good counter examples to what I've said - public radio, for instance, but that is a very particular case.  First and foremost, the "charity" is actually a form of media, and has an actual audience, so this kind of spending is very much like a traditional ad buy.  

**TL;DR Don't do it.**

Sorry, man - looks like you're one of those victims of Republican talking points that Gruber is talking about. 




 TIL; the only valid laws are constitutional amendments. 




 No, he said that "the stupidity of the American voter" required that the law be unclear about what insurance actually is.  ANY solvent insurance plan requires that healthy people pay in more than they take out than sick people.  That is what a fucking insurance plan actually *is*.

But since Republicans turn everything into a political issue, even that simple fact which follows from logic is somehow a scandal.  Yes, to Republicans it's a huge scandal.  The rest of the world calls this "insurance".

So, yes, he was right on the money:  people who are swayed by Republican talking points are in fact stupid.

Now I know I'm being trolled.
 




 Part of the standard Obama playbook - make statements placating the base while running a government that does the opposite. 




 Seriously?    The GOP is carrying out the Koch agenda, and their agenda is pretty clear:
http://www.sanders.senate.gov/koch-brothers

  * Repeal of federal campaign finance laws - means that politicians serve the wealthy, and resulting in the US becoming [a de facto oligarchy](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/princeton-experts-say-us-no-longer-democracy ).
  * Reduction of social services, which reduces the bargaining power of labor.  This results in lower wages and workers rights.  
  * Against laws that police corporations, but none focused on reducing policing of regular people.  The result of this kind of policy is that corporate profits and property get state protection, but the freedom and rights of regular people aren't protected.  


Yet, at the same time that conservatives seek special rights and protection for the owners of property, they want to abridge personal freedoms of regular people:

  * DOMA
  * Reagan's War on Drugs (which right wing Dems shamefully perpetuated)
  * Anti-Abortion regulations
  * Anti-athiest laws
  * Anti-union laws: http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/30/g-o-p-platform-seeks-to-weaken-powers-of-unions/?_r=0

The list is so long, it's almost  silly to respond.
 




 Yet, those are the results of conservative policy. 




 Don't worry, we all prefer corporations controlling our lives. 




 **Submission Statement**

A NYTimes piece that goes in depth into the controversy surrounding the Supreme Court's decision to take up the challenge to Obamacare.  In fact, everything from the decision of SCOTUS to take up the case when precedent was largely being set by the lower courts to the details of the specific legal issue itself suggest a truly unprecedented action.  Which the author argues is worse, legally speaking, than what happened in Bush v. Gore. 



















 I mean in this sense - economic egalitarianism is a central concept of classical liberal left libertarianism.  That is, obviously, also a central theme of Warren's politics.  Checkout the entry in Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-libertarianism#Classical_liberal_left-libertarianism.  

 Contemporary left-libertarian scholars such as Hillel Steiner, Peter Vallentyne, Philippe Van Parijs, Michael Otsuka, and David Ellerman root an economic egalitarianism in the classical liberal concepts of self-ownership and appropriation. They hold that it is  for anyone to claim private ownership of natural resources to the detriment of others, a condition John Locke explicated in Two Treatises of Government. Locke argued that natural resources could be appropriated as long doing so satisfies the proviso that there remains "enough, and as good, left in common for others."

Penned by the Directory of Duke's Islamic Studies department, this article talks about the Muslim way of asking how you are doing:

 Kayf haal-ik? or, in Persian, Haal-e shomaa chetoreh? How is your haal?

 What is this haal that you inquire about? It is the transient state of ones heart. In reality, we ask, How is your heart doing at this very moment, at this breath? When I ask, How are you? that is really what I want to know.   









 Agree with everything you say here.

So can the various sides can agree on desired outcomes?  It may be that this just moves the problem to a different place, but I think, it's a more honest approach.  

You suggested "Human flourishing".  That seems like a good starting point that probably both left and right can agree on.  So how would we quantify it?  What would we accept as evidence that one system or another leads to the desired outcome? 









 She's left libertarian, but in America, Libertarian usually refers to the right-wing version. 




 Rights don't have any basis in physical reality - they are just rules that are made up to support a particular way of life. We don't have a right to land ownership anymore than a beaver has a "right" to dam a river.   So talking about rights is essentially meaningless - or a way of forcing agreement through assertion.  Rather than ask what rights people have - because anyone could assert anything, and they have: a right to healthcare, a right to move freely anywhere, a right to enslave. If we insist on basing a discussion on rights, there's no way to get agreement, unless the participants already agree about the same set of rights. It makes a lot more sense to ask what outcomes we'd like to have, and figure out what rules will support that form of life.

 First two paragraphs.  

 *Among the most disturbing political phenomena of our time is the emergence in the newly created state of Israel of the "Freedom Party" (Tnuat Haherut) a political party closely akin in its organization, methods, political philosophy and social appeal to the Nazi and Fascist parties.  It was formed out of the membership and following of the former Irgun Zvai Leumi, a terrorist, right-wing, chauvinist organization in Palestine.*

 The current visit of Menachen Begin, leader of this party, to the United States is obviously calculated to give the impression of American support for his party in the coming Israeli elections, and to cement political ties with conservative Zionist elements in the United States. Several Americans of national repute have lent their names to welcome his visit.  **It is inconceivable that those who oppose fascism throughout the world, if correctly informed as to Mr. Begin's political record and perspectives could add their names and support to the movement he represents.**


So please shut the fuck up.

Good luck with your "trades".  No doubt the government will step in to ensure the solvency of your industry when you geniuses blow up the world again.
 




  The entire reason the right came back in 2010 is because the left began to move, well, left. It was an almost Newtonian response to the agenda of the President.

I think the evidence says the opposite.   Democratic turnout is known to be low during non-Presidential elections, so there's that, but it doesn't account for the particularly low D turnout that year.  *That lack of enthusiasm* is the real story.  It's not that people turned against the Ds.  No one was for them anymore.  And in fact, in the South, it was the Blue Dogs who tacked right trying to placate conservatives who were most thoroughly wiped out.  That at least is something we have to be thankful for.  Good riddance to them and their malign impact on the party.

The fallacy of median voter theory is that there is a middle to appeal to.  There is not.  [The public is more divided than ever.](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/06/12/7-things-to-know-about-polarization-in-america/ )  What does exist is a difference in enthusiasm.  Republicans with their constant irrational appeals to fear have a reliable strategy for turning out a dwindling base.  Democrats squander their natural advantage, constantly alienate theirs, and take their failures as reasons to move further right, even as public policy choices lie far to the left on issue after issue.

It's hard to find a one stop shop for data on this, but try googling around yourself.  Look for polls where Americans are assessed for their views on actual public policy issues, not on party preference. 

Here are some from the first page when googling "poll american public policy preferences":

* [This summary](http://theprogressivecynic.com/2014/05/02/is-the-usa-center-right-an-issue-by-issue-breakdown/ ) shows that on issue after issue, Americans are progressive.  

 * They want spending for entitlements and the poor over deficit reduction, left and right both want the wealth distribution to be more equal than it actually is, even as they both underestimate how unequal it actually is.  
 * They support increasing taxes on the wealthy by large margins.  
 * 71% support increasing the minimum wage.
 * vast majorities approve of labor unions
 * a plurality think we spend too much on defense
 * a decisive majority is positioned to the left on voting rights
 * a vast majority wants to legalize marijuana
 

The list goes on and on and.  You should read it.

Milquetoast Democrats like Mondale and Dukakis haven't been able to articulate the issues that public cares about because they've sliced and diced it into tiny issues.  Republicans have a simple marketing message based in fear, religion and nationalism.  Democrats could, but don't articulate what the public actually cares about: economic fairness.  They've followed clueless consultants like Bob Shrum right off the cliff.  

The fact is, that the Democrats have been on the defensive since they abandoned their post as the champions of economic justice.  Until they get back to their traditional stance, the contempt of the public for them and for government in general will only increase - and it will be well deserved. 




 How can I take this guy seriously?  Anyone who opens with a hot headed ad hominem attack is just begging for eyes to roll.

 Just what we need  another economist with ZERO real work experience. The latest economist destined to destroy the world in the same manner as Karl Marx is Thomas Piketty and his new book Capital in the Twenty-First Century that is destined to perhaps kill more people than Marx ever did.

He follows with a  sequence of untestable claims and red baiting that seems like an audition for Fox rather than a serious critique.  This bit made me laugh (emphasis in the original):

  Piketty is only focused on the disparity between rich and poor. He too sees this as evil rather than trying to figure out **HOW** the economy functions. Piketty is off on a quest to control the world and place even more of our rights, privileges, and immunities into the hands of guess who - **government**! 

Sorry, but this essay is written for true believers.  It's not going to convince anyone else.  For example:

 Piketty claims the current level of rising wealth inequality imperils the very future of capitalism. He claims he has proved it with his book  *good one*! 

That is an argument?

And then he offers this sequence of non-sequitors in support:

 He totally fails to even comprehend **HOW** the global economy functions or that John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946) in the end admitted his ideas were wrong and that he had hoped that Adam Smiths **Invisible Hand** would save Britain. Here is a picture of Keynes at Bretton Woods discussing how to save the world with government intervention speaking to Roosevelts **Henry Morgenthau, Jr.** (1891- 1967)  Secretary of the Treasury.


Sheesh.  Four paragraphs in and all I've got is apoplectic drivel.  I honestly can't waste my time going any further.  If you can summarize the argument and point to a chart, I'd be happy to look, but this writing is self-discrediting.  It's like the author is on a crusade to portray himself as a biased ideologue.  

Serious criticisms, please.
 




 So does including that data invalidate his findings? And how so?  I'd like to see the analysis.  

I'd love to hear some substantial criticisms, but  glib responses only serve to make me skeptical of the anti-Piketty crowd. 




 USA #1,  folks! 




 Link? 




 The Consulting by RPM review claims "the most obvious problem with Piketty's book is that he wants to make workers poorer, just so long as it will hurt rich capitalists even more."

Seriously?  The author's opinion about what the Piketty's motives are is "most obvious problem"?  The author have spent enough time sneering about progressives and invoking Marx to let us know they've got their ideological fur up.  That they lead with this as their top criticism certainly hints that there's no there there.  

Specifically, both Reisman and Consulting by RPM seem to completely ignore Piketty's main finding: that Capitalism in its normal state leads to a situation where inherited wealth accumulates more quickly than earned wealth, and that after a brief anomolous period, we are now going back to that.  This is the same situation that existed in fin de siecle France - classes became fixed, and merit was not rewarded.  When this is true, the road to wealth starts by being born into it, and it becomes difficult to impossible to change your economic standing through work.

To point to the cool toys that capitalism produces while overlooking the loss of class mobility as the ConsultingByRPM piece does, is not to different from  saying "let them eat cake".  

Finally, the "bombshell blunder" that they report from Chris Giles of FT has been thorough and humiliatingly debunked.  And finally, invoking the far out of mainstream and explicitly anti-empirical Austrians really lays the cards out for all to see. These guys are another bunch of unhappy Libertarian ideologues.  There have got to be better critiques than these. 




 I tried reading the Reisman blog. I couldn't understand whether his specific technical criticisms have merit or not.  He's obviously deeply opposed to Piketty ideologically - he complains about Piketty referencing Marx too much and von Mises, Rothbard et al. too little, for example. He is so hot headed, it's sometimes hard to tell whether there is a valid technical criticism or whether he's just objecting to the conclusions:

 The depths of Pikettys ignorance are such that he believes that capital accumulation not only does not raise real wages but reduces them, by allegedly increasing the share of national income that goes to profits and correspondingly reducing the share that goes to wages, while the overall total of what is produced remains unchanged or increases only very modestly, and then not by virtue of any contribution to production made by capital

He does provide a reference for this, but it's to a file on his local machine, not on the web, so it's impossible to validate. Honestly, it's so hard to get through paragraphs that are filled with this kind of name calling and so poorly supported.  If you're going to call someone an idiot, you better demonstrate this without any doubt, or you risk eroding your own credibility.  Why doesn't he show where Piketty makes the claims he says he does, so we can make up our own mind about it?  Why doesn't he show the mathematics and the specific results that demonstrate Piketty is wrong? Reisman just comes off as an unhappy ideologue.

 




 Ok, that's a start.

Median voter theory is conventional wisdom.  And the Democrats have accepted it without question -- and without test -- for 40 years.  As a result, they've fielded increasingly right wing candidates.  While they've  negotiated themselves to the right of Nixon, Republicans have steadily pushed the Overton window to the right.  

At the same time, these theories *completely* discount actual polling preferences of the American public for the middle.  Healthcare is a good example where poll after poll has shown overwhelming support for both  the public option and outright socialism in the form of universal care. 

Yet, we effectively have two right wing parties.  Is it a surprise that American's opinion of Congress is the lowest it has ever been?  How do the politics of one of America's most popular presidents ever (FDR) fit in today?  Had Republicans followed the median voter theory scolds, we would have a much more liberal country today.  Instead, Democats did, and rightist policies have won. 




 This is what a leader looks like, folks.  We need her or someone like her in 2016, not that carpetbagger from Arkansas. 




 It equally emphasizes that people are pissed off, and of those pissed off people, some are crazy.

 A huge problem with the Bond franchise is keeping it fresh.  Every iteration, you have to avoid it being a cookie cutter operation.  You're basically on the hook for delivering a similar set of tropes:  Go to HQ, chat with Money Penny, Meet with Q, Go on Mission, Meet Girl, Banter with Villain, Go to Villains Layer, Kill villain, Pan out while kissing the girl.  

People howled when blond, blue-eyed Craig was scheduled to take the lead.  The style of Casino Royale totally broke our expectations and shocked us a bit.  The style of Bond, brutal, blue eyed and *coarse* --- not a gentleman at all --- was unexpected, and woke us up.  It was a completely different kind of charisma that carried the show.  And that's why it worked, why it was the one of the best Bonds in decades.

A black bond, especially with an actor with Elba's presence,  opens up a whole new set of possibilities.  There's a whole new style and totally new kinds of interactions that can be explored.  What does it mean when the world's top secret agent is a black guy?  Totally different dynamic.  I'm dying to see what they do with this.   




  Hilary   the Left need to make these conciliatory gestures

To paraphrase one of our Presidents, there's smart conciliation and stupid conciliation.  Let's not do stupid conciliation.  We've had 6 years of that.

It's time for the left to start articulating a real vision.  Hillary's clearly stated goal is to co-opt enough of the left to win so she can continue executing hawkish and neoliberal policies.  Fuck that noise. 




 I.e., we are fucked. 




 She's signaling as clear as any Democrat ever can that she's going to slavishly follow Wall Street's commands. 
























 Gotta love the "But, all our leaders are war criminals"  argument.  'Murca!

 That is a dense paper.  How the WaPo author derived that claim is not obvious to me. 









 The full text I summarized:

 In perhaps the starkest illustration, economists from Harvard University and the University of Chicago wrote in a recent paper that every dollar a worker earns in a research field spills over to make the economy $5 better off. Every dollar a similar worker earns in finance comes with a drain, making the economy 60 cents worse off. 




 **Submission Statement**

Covers recent studies from economists at Harvard, U Chicago et al. on the damage over financialization is doing to our economy.  Instead of being a generalized lament, the article describes some specific measures that demonstrate the point.  For instance, unlike other fields, where technological advancement has led to a decrease in fees, in finance, the opposite has happened.   









 Finally a proper use of all caps.  Strunk   fucking White right here.

 I think describing her as a visionary on inequality only captures a narrow part of why she's important.  Ultimately, Warren is articulating the short-comings of Capitalism itself, and that, arguably is the most critical issue of all today.  In contrast, Gore's focus on climate change is merely narrow and technical, for instance.  Warren's broad critique of a system which is incorrectly calculating value, unfairly distributing resources and harm is an umbrella that includes almost all the other issues that are confronting us. 

Climate change, for example, is a problem of markets not taking into account externalities.  Even police brutality becomes part of the conversation because it is one side of the story of unequal application of justice --- Warren has pointed out how the budget of the rich peoples' police (i.e., Wall Street regulators) was cut, and has talked about how DoJ is viciously prosecuting drug crimes.  It's a short step to also talk about police brutality.  Campaign finance reform is another - rich people are bending the system to their will.  

Warren is tying all the big issues together through by articulating the critical flaw of neoliberalism, which has been the policy of Ds and Rs for the past 40 years.  A system which rewards ownership (by respecting only property rights) does the expected--- it doles out rewards to property owners and pain to the poor.  And that touches climate, justice, financial regulation, foreign policy (though I'm disturbed by her statements on Israel), education, health care and social security --- in short, the whole body of politics.

Democrats have been a slew of mumblers (and I include Gore, whom I have a lot of respect for) --- who've failed to articulate an over arching theme.  Yet, it's been so simple.  They've just been scared to go there because they all bought into the Washington wisdom that you have to unquestioningly worship markets to be "serious".  I think this is why, whether they know it or not, so many people now feel that Warren must be President. 









  That being said, is it justifiable to shut down the entire federal government in protest? Particularly if it comes from the Democratic party, I think that only further legitimates the notion that the government can and should be shuttered in a symbolic protest against a provision that the majority of Congress agrees with.

I resonated with Taibbi's fit of pique, and didn't think too deeply about this.  But your analysis is insightful and hard to disagree with.    The problem, clearly, is Obama and all Blue Dogs.  Perhaps the right action is for progressives to break ranks and start speaking in a clear independent voice, as Warren has.   




  I guess the question is: can Warren open that window back up?

I haven't seen a politician who is so *needed* in over a decade.  Gore was a terrible politician, but a visionary on key issues - internet and climate change.  Warren is a visionary on inequality and is appearing to be a formidable personality.  So, yes, I think there's hope. 




 But what's the point of that?  That's another open ended statement like the first that just throws vague cold water on Warren without adding anything actionable to the conversation.  *Of course* we should focus on actions, so what?  We should also brush our teeth.

And to respond to the specific point, speeches are how politics gets done, and particularly, how populist politics gets done.  Without speeches, all you have are a bunch of insiders doing back-room deals.  Excitement around populist positioning is what gives a politician power to push that position inside the back rooms --- for example in the DPCC, to which she was recently appointed.

Let's keep the discussion specific.  "Warren needs to do ___, ___ and ___.  She said ___, ___ and ___, but didn't do anything.  This is more of the same."  Would be a better starting point. 




 I.e., "Don't trust politicians!"

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromide_(language):

 A bromide is a phrase or platitude that, having been employed excessively, suggests insincerity or a lack of originality in the speaker

 




 I have friends who were fans of his.  One actually went to meet him at his office when he was in Congress a couple of years after his speech at Kerry's convention.  Obama wasn't really a household name at that time, obviously.  

I remember him being excited about some Senator who, he averred, was "onto something good".  The Obama bumper stickers soon followed.  I distinctly recall the sense of disappointment when I found out it was the "One America" speech guy.  That prattle was the toast of Washington, a tone deaf feel good paean that was blind to the radicalism emerging on the right, and which, idiotically, urged compromise.  In this way, his critics are right, he is like Chamberlain.

Obama has done real damage - not only are the inattentive (like ban-chali) now reflexively cynical and disillusioned, he shifted partisan Democratic politics rightward at a time when the country was ready for an FDR, and the base craved one.  In this way, he is not unlike the idol he repeatedly praised, Ronald Reagan.  While the Gipper nudged the American middle to the right, Obama led blind Democratic partisans off the cliff as they defended him on bailouts for banks, torpedoing the public option behind closed doors, whistle blower prosecutions, domestic spying, and lack of accountability for torture and war crimes.

The numb-skulls who were too dense to see the signals back in 2012 and now worry about Warren are only proving that cognitive deficits can manifest recurrently in fresh forms. 









 It's not an analogy - it's a parody.  The original argument is a sloppy bromide, suitable for a dive bar drunk, but now popular amongst jilted Obama supporters -  but they only have themselves to blame.  They were obtuse last time around, and they think wisdom is being obtuse in the opposite direction this time around.
 




 Anyone who thought Obama was a progressive in the primaries was seriously not paying attention.  

1. He voted for telecom immunity

2. He threw progressive Joe Lamont under the bus and supported Joe Lieberman

3. He explicitly said supporters were misconstruing him as a progressive

4. He repeatedly praised Reagan

5. His speech  at Kerry's DNC ("One America") was milquetoast idiocy that called for compromise and triangulation.  Honestly, progressives who got  excited about this nonsense deserved to be disappointed.


Let's try paying attention this time.

Obama != Warren.   




 Hitler also made speeches that got a lot of hype.  Therefore Warren is like Hitler too. 




 Meh - people laughed that at the idea  a black guy named Hussein could ever in a million years win the Presidency, especially after 9/11. 




 The lesson of Obama is look carefully at candidates' actions, not just their fine words.  I thought it was obvious in the primaries - Obama embraced Joe Lieberman and threw a great progressive, Joe Lamont, under the bus, then went on to support telecom immunity.  I didn't understand why no one wanted to talk about that back then.  

We need to take a very close look at candidates, and demand fighters.  Obama, to me, seemed terrible tone-deaf and the absolutely wrong choice even as early as his speech at Kerry's nominating convention.  There is not a Republican America and a Democratic America, there is one America, he told us.  This was delusional feel good nonsense for the progressives that bought in.  For those who were awake, it already hinted at his politics of triangulation, which is to say, someone whose strategy is to placate his supporters while rewarding them with right wing policies.

And now we have Mrs. "Hard Choices".  As a wise man once said, Fool me once... can't... get fooled again!
 




 I call bullshit.

Not only does that seem false - most liberals are pissed about Obama's anti-constitutional militarism and triangulating neoliberalism --  it is demonstrably false.  Just do a search:

What gets upvoted when you search for ["Obama drones"](http://np.reddit.com/search?q=obama+drone+subreddit%3Apolitics restrict_sr=off sort=relevance t=all) or ["Obama torture"](http://np.reddit.com/search?q=obama+torture+subreddit%3Apolitics restrict_sr=off sort=relevance t=all ) ?  If we assume a liberal bias of the politics subreddit and that upvotes confer agreement (both generally accepted ideas) we find that liberals are promoting news articles which are sharply critical of the President on both of these issues.  

For example here are the Obama drone links sorted by "relevance" and "all time". 14 of the top 15 are unambiguously negative in their commentary on the President.   Only one (#8) is ambiguous.  None are positive.  A quick check of the posters submission streams will confirm that they are liberals.

1. House Democrats demand Obama release full legal basis for drone strikes

2. How Drones Help Al Qaeda: DEAR OBAMA, when a U.S. drone missile kills a child in Yemen, the father will go to war with you, guaranteed. Nothing to do with Al Qaeda. 

3. Jon Stewart Eviscerates Obama For Withholding Drone Memos: What Happened To Promise Of Transparency? 

4. New Evidence That Team Obama Misled Us About the Drone War - Official speeches are crafted to give the impression that we're mostly targeting Al Qaeda members. We're not.

5. 5 Ways President Obama Has Doubled Down on Bush's Most Tragic Mistakes: Obama has kept the U.S. on a permanent war footing, from drone strikes and proxy detentions to warrantless wiretapping and the continued operation of Guantanamo.

6. Obama Will Finally Have to Explain Why the US Can Kill Americans with Drones

7. President Obama: The drones don't work, they just make it worse

8. No More Drones For CIA. Three senior officials tell Daniel Klaidman that the Obama administration is poised to shift the CIAs drone program to the Pentagon.

9. Jon Stewart Slams Obama Over Drone Strike Memo 


10. The president as hitman in chief --"Obama has launched over 250 drone attacks during his three years in office, more than six times as many as the lawless yahoo Bush ordered during his entire presidency."


11. Why do liberals not attack Obama for perpetuating Bush's foreign policy?


12. Nobel Prize winner Malala told Obama U.S. drone attacks fuel terrorism.

13. Right wingers gloating about Obama on Fox News: "He's a born-again neocon. We've got the drones, we've got military tribunals, we've got Gitmo, we're bombing Libya. People who voted for Obama got 4 more years of Bush." - 

14. What happened to the anti-war left? 

15. Noam Chomsky: Obama Is Running Biggest Terrorist Operation That Exists... People have a reaction when they lose a loved one to an American drone strike. They dont say, Fine, I dont care if my cousin was murdered. They become what we call terrorists.

**EDIT** More support that this is liberal opinion: the sources are all center left to left. TruthDig, RawStory, The Atlantic, Vice, Al Jazeera, Daily Beast, NYTimes. 




 Typical right winger spouting false equivalency bullshit.  See my response in this thread. 




 Conservatives are, in essence, profoundly anti-American.   














 But Democrats, generally speaking, aren't arguing *for* torture.  They are (some of them) only deluded in thinking their leader is anti-torture.  Separate issue. 




 Even worse is people saying that it shouldn't matter because all Presidents are then guilty.  Normally, one should take this as an indictment of government policy, but some people think it's an excuse.  It's an indication of how corrupt the public's ethics and discourse have become since 9/11. 




 No question, but it's worth reviewing Reagan's statements on the matter to see how far we've drifted in our public debate. 














 **Submission Statement**

Torture apologists on the right have tried to obscure the commitments of United States to prosecute torture.  Who better than their most holy saint to explain it to them?  This is Reagan's message to the Senate advocating ratification of the "Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment", which he notes was agreed to *unanimously* by the international community.  The Convention was ratified by the US Senate in 1994.  



















 The US is a signatory to the Geneva conventions which are a direct result of the Nuremberg trials. 




  You can execute nearly every US president if you apply the Nuremberg laws.

Speaks volumes about US policy, doesn't it. 









 Please read the words of the US prosecutor at the Nuremberg trials, Justice Robert Jackson of SCOTUS:

["And let me make clear that while this law is first applied against German aggressors, the law includes, and if it is to serve a useful purpose it must condemn aggression by any other nations, including those which sit here now in judgment."](http://www.roberthjackson.org/the-man/speeches-articles/speeches/speeches-by-robert-h-jackson/opening-statement-before-the-international-military-tribunal/ ) 




 **Submission Statement**

The opening statement of Justice Robert Jackson of the SCOTUS at the Nuremberg Trials.  Of great relevance is the emphasis he puts on the equal application of the laws not only on Germany and Japan, but also on the victors, the United States, Britain and other axis powers.   









 **Submission Statement**

An important article that's worth a read for those who've been following the torture debate.  While the idea of accountability for these crimes has long seemed like a naive hope held by human rights advocates and parts of the left, this article explains that serious consideration is being given to the concept in international legal circles. 









 **Submission Statement**

An in-depth discussion of the historical, philosophical origins of the legal tradition of "Rule of Law" and what it means.  This is discussion from last year, but seems particularly relevant in light of the recent torture revelations and the stories about grand juries failing to bring indictments against police officers.  

 

 









 Thanks for the links.  That's helpful. 




 Undoubtedly they will ignore.  And agree that the Nobel Peace Prize winner is on the hook too. 




 So you're arguing that no one should attempt to hold anyone responsible for war crimes... because everyone is guilty?

How is that different from the argument that we shouldn't enforce any laws because police are corrupt? 




  But the UN has a fair amount to answer for as well especially with African peacekeeping operations where blue helmets have done their fair share of rape, pillaging, torture and failure to prevent genocide. 

I haven't heard that before. Do you have links?

Are you arguing that (1) American war crimes should go unpunished, or are you saying that (2) there's no organization that has the moral authority to do it, or that (3) it is politically impractical, therefore will never happen?  I just flat out disagree with (1) - a completely immoral idea.

I don't really understand (2) --- one could have argued that the Dresden bombings and Hiroshima/Nagasaki obviated the allies' right to judge their enemies, for instance.  So I don't buy what you're advocating in (2).

However,  the prediction in (3) seems plausible.  Powerful elites are rarely held accountable, so that would be par for the course.
 




 Pardoning them continues a terrible precedent, one that began with the pardon of Richard Nixon, and which has metastasized into a full-fledged dual-tier system of justice.  People at the bottom are viciously punished  for relatively minor offenses (including being killed as part of "normal" law enforcement activity), while elites, guilty of massive war and financial crimes, go free. 









 I don't think it absolves them --- we didn't use that reasoning for Germans and Japanese.   









 They are advocating going after both the officials who ordered and the people who acted on the orders. 




 I can't wait until someone responds to this kind of bullshit (on TV) with "We don't hate America. We hate *you*. Because you represent the opposite of all the true values of this country." 









 Appropriate handle. 




 It's quite a trick they're pulling -- appearing to condemn torture, while having worked consistently to prevent this from coming to light, and undermining any form of accountability.   




 Not a matter of disagreement.  Everyone must be equally accountable under the law. 




 Clever of W and Dick to opt out before their crime spree.
 




 Said every fascist everywhere. 




 Good idea, let's compare ourselves to religious extremist terrorists.  Oh wait, that describes the Republican party, doesn't it? 




 Thanks.  I think my point is that the conversation begins with us as citizens - not to fall into the nationalistic realpolitik that the Sunday shows want us to buy into. Partisans (on both sides, though the right bears more guilt) want to shield their leaders from prosecution.  This is a kind of imperial and authoritarian politics which is directly at odds with the revolutionary principles which have guided us up until recent decades.   




  I simply mean to say that the U.S.'s contribution to the world through the UN is the only reason the UN has stayed quasi-relevant at best. 

I don't disagree with that.  Our elected leaders may think that because "they" fund the UN, they should not be accountable.  My point is that the citizens of the US fund the UN, not our elected leaders.  The question is whether we, as citizens of the US, want a policy whereby our military and elected officials may not be held unaccountable for war crimes by anyone.  That is the politics of authoritarianism, and directly counters basic American ideals.

 The enforcement of UN policies when referencing the actions of individual nations have been, since the existence of the UN, slanted with national interests from the accusing parties. 

Isn't this exactly the point of the UN? A place where international disputes can be settled peacefully and with the agreement of the world community?

 Not to mention the UN ignoring multiple instances of genocide and torture throughout the world giving less and less reason for the US or any member nation to submit themselves to ICC prosecution.

Could you give examples of this?  The first thing that comes to mind is ignoring what happened in Rwanda.  The current example that comes to mind is Palestine, and before that, Nicaragua's CIA-funded death squads, and East Timor.  Apart from Rwanda, in all of these cases the US was directly involved or shielding a client state from accountability.  In the Rwandan case, the US (under Clinton) and its allies put pressure on the UN to ignore the warning signals.

Regarding the ICC, Bush and Cheney opted out at the beginning of their term, and conveniently  before embarking on a spree of war crimes. So I'm not sure what you mean when you say 

  It's time for the U.S. to stop playing with the UN 

That is already the case.  The US and its clients commit atrocities and are not held accountable.  

I'm also confused by the idea that the US "should just acknowledge that world affairs are not black and white".  I can only infer that this means we should continue our policy of committing and supporting war crimes and justifying it by any means necessary in the UN - when that suits us.  Obviously, I strongly disagree.  

 




 "Don't police the policemen!", said all wingnuts everywhere. 
























  One of my favorite films. 

Mine too :). 




 I thought the Barry Lyndon voice over had a quite different character than what one finds in Nolan -- there's a very wry kind of observation going on constantly.  The voice itself is a character that more serves the purpose of highlighting the absurd humor of the proceedings than being a blunt expositor of plot and emotion as in Nolan. 




 The sound mix was deliberate - I think there's a video of him talking about it somewhere - or see [here](http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/17/interstellar-sound-christopher-nolan ).  The effect he was going after was the experience of being in those situations -- where the human voice is merely part of the soundscape, another sound effect.  Hitchcock used this technique very deliberately  when critical pieces of exposition were being delivered.  The effect was to cause the audience to pay greater attention - to lean in to observe a critical moment.  In Interstellar, the frustration of not hearing voice helps us experience the chaos, the overwhelming power of the phenomena that the astronauts experience. 




 So we should support deception because "it's a blog".

 














 For the record, I don't think history will be kind to him, and he'll deserve it.  His legacy is one of failing to hold criminals accountable --- the architects of torture and war crimes from the Bush era, as well as those on Wall Street.  His presidency will be compared unfavorably with FDR's.  He will be seen as having failed to seize the opportunities in a pivotal moment, choosing instead to extend the authoritarian and neoliberal policies of his predecessors.  He will be seen as ushering in an era of deep and unrelenting pessimism when he could have articulated a new direction forward. 









 Reiterating findings is perfectly fine - I'm objecting to the title.  It's a cheesy marketing  trick.  The author had some old article about group psych kicking around, added a couple of flimsy lines about Ferguson, and pasted this title on it.  This is both lazy and deceptive. 




 Why?  That's the message of Republicans at both the state and national levels. 




 You obviously didn't listen to Sen. Rockefeller's testimony at the hearings. 




 Seems like the title is link bait for a fairly general article on basic findings of group psychology. 









 Where is it? 




   I note with some exasperation, by the way, that he feels the need to throw some imprecations regarding the financial industry into an article about an issue that has nothing to do with it. 

Let me defend him.  I think his insight is quite apropos.  There is a mounting frustration that the entire game is rigged.  People on the bottom get treated brutally for tiny infractions, while elites get away with crimes.  That certainly is part of the cultural zeitgeist.   

In Berkeley and Oakland, a large number of the demonstrators are self-identified Occupy activists. It's a very short leap for these people to connect the same dots that Taibbi has. The original target of Occupy was Wall Street, which activists argued were essentially stealing from the public, but which the government was unwilling to police.  Now, these same people are out on the streets angry that powerless people are over-policed.  That is Taibbi's argument in a nutshell.

In the original protests, the police, were largely perceived as preserving public order, though there was a sense, because of their occassional overzealousness that they stood on the side of the "elite criminals of Wall Street" (i.e., from the perspective of the activists).  Yet, that role was only incidental.  As a result of the Ferguson/Garner protests, police themselves are now the issue.  So, in the eyes of the protesters, they have gone from being an instrument protecting elite criminals to themselves being criminals themselves in need of policing.  

That is what Taibbi is talking about.  Those activists on the ground are starting to see the police themselves as illegitimate.  That is a sea change.  I think you'll agree that in this light, the stats you cite (from 2011, no less) aren't really in scope here.  This is a question of what will happen at the next demonstration, now that police themselves are seen as part of the problem.   And in fact, [recent polls support the argument that, amongst minorities at least, confidence has been lost](http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/poll-shows-deep-racial-divide-confidence-law-enforcement-n263041 ): 

 And while 72 percent of the public and 79 percent of whites say that they have "a great deal" or "a fair amount" of confidence that police in their community will not use excessive force on suspects, just 43 percent of black Americans say the same.

Conservatives are unlikely to see things this way because it doesn't fit their narrative, but their opinions don't matter in this.  A powerful anger is brewing which inequities and injustices will continue to feed, meaning that there will be more protests.  What will happen at the next one and the next one after that now that those protesters see the police as illegitimate? 














 "Reagan bankrupted the Soviet Union" is conservative propaganda that originates from the same crowd that sold us the idea that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction:

http://open.salon.com/blog/paul_j_orourke/2009/01/17/losing_the_cold_warthe_true_story_of_why_the_ussr_fell

The real explanation is more boring, but has the benefit of being believable: the Soviets couldn't produce enough grain so relied on oil exports.  When the Saudi oil embargo ended,oil prices fell by 2/3rds and the USSR's export income collapsed.  Reagan didn't do that, and no one claims he's responsible for that either. 

Gorbachev and other Soviet officials support this view: http://www.theatlantic.com/past/politics/foreign/reagrus.htm.  

 A far more persuasive reason for the Soviet economic decline is the rigid "command economy" imposed by Stalin in the early 1930s. It did not reward individual or collective effort; it absolved Soviet producers from the discipline of the market; and it gave power to officials who could not be held accountable by consumers. Consequently much of the investment that went into the civilian sector of the economy was wasted. 

 Gorbachev felt free to make a series of proposals for deep cuts in his country's nuclear arsenal because he was confident that the United States would not attack the Soviet Union. In conversation with his military advisers he rejected any plans that were premised on war with the West. Since he saw no threat of attack by the United States, Gorbachev was not intimidated by the military programs of the Reagan Administration. "These were unnecessary and wasteful expenditures that we were not going to match," he told us. If both superpowers were to avoid the growing risk of accidental war, they had to make deep cuts in their strategic forces. "This was an imperative of the nuclear age."

In fact, a Soviet ambassador insists that Reagan's policies unwittingly prolonged the Cold War: "Star Wars was exploited by hardliners to complicate Gorbachev's attempt to end the Cold War."  The hero in ending the Cold War, if there was one, was Gorbachev. 



















  And unless the police suffer a massive crisis of legitimacy, such that on a very basic level we outright don't trust them to use force, this is pretty much the way it has to be. 

Interesting that you mention that.  Did you see Taibbi's latest?
http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-police-in-america-are-becoming-illegitimate-20141205 




 He was present when the Soviet Union ended, but he certainly didn't end it.  The Soviet Union collapsed because its economic system was intrinsically broken, or do Republicans disagree with that now?  Or do they just disagree with that only when they want to praise Reagan?

LOL.  That's why Democrats today are the ones waving the Confederate flag, right?  Oh, wait... 




 It's a sick joke.  We spend billions on war to protect the  interests of billionaires, fake-praise the troops to make the task seem honorable, and discard the broken bodies and lives that come out of the process.

 Honestly, that seems somewhat myopic.  It's pretty clear to even the most casual observer that they are both on the conservative side of the spectrum on many issues.  Hillary, arguably even more hawkish than Bill.  If we ignore the past, we'll repeat our mistakes.  If we don't understand history, we're won't ask the right questions today. 




 Hillary is not just 20 years ago. 




 There are a lot of "liberals" who didn't pick up on Obama's conservative politics until it was far too late and still don't understand that the Clintons are part of the problem.    




 Understanding our mistakes is the first step if we want to avoid repeating them.  Electing conservadems is proven path to failure. 









 "Hard choices".  Neoliberals really ought to trademark that one.  Blair and his comrades have been making the "hard choices" to serve the interests of globalist billionaires, and the voters are making it difficult for do-gooders like him to transfer even more wealth to them using the levers of government.  If only the  common people were capable of understanding!

I don't have words for the kind of disgust that Blair and his ilk fill me with.

 A lot of disease were mocked as psychological disorders before the causes were discovered.   One of the messages that needs to get out is that non-celiac gluten sensitivity is a thing that can be seen with molecular diagnostics like RAST.

 Race is a big part of it:
http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/feature/wp/2013/03/22/gun-deaths-shaped-by-race-in-america/ 




  Look at the crime hotspots.. the areas where most of these murders occur. They aren't in places with super-high firearms ownership like Wyoming or New Hampshire. They're in Detroit, Chicago..

Did a quick search.  It looks like most of the violence per capita is in southern cities, but not, interestingly, in southern rural areas:

http://articles.latimes.com/2012/dec/20/news/la-ol-gun-homicide-states-20121220

 Urban states with heavy gang populations such as California and New York aren't particularly high up on the list of per-capita gun killings, though of course in terms of absolute numbers, they look like murder capitals because of their big populations. 

 **Mid-size Southern states seem to be the places people are trigger-happiest** -- and where, of course, political opposition to gun control often runs strongest. Perhaps that's because **most of the bloodletting happens in Southern cities**, and it's in rural areas -- where gun violence is slight -- that gun rights are held most sacred.

 Two marketing agencies serving the same customer. 




 That's rational policy, though.   




 So many racists on reddit nowadays. 




 Why do you think gun violence is so much higher here in the United States?  By the way - I'm not reflexively anti-gun.  I'm from Canada, and we have more guns per person up there, but way fewer gun deaths per person. 




 The coffee lawsuit is an urban legend.  If you know the facts, it's pretty clear that McDonald's deserved the punitive damages:

 Trial testimony showed that at 180 to 190 degrees, McDonald's coffee was much hotter than that served by other restaurants or by people in their homes. **The fast-food chain had received at least 700 complaints about hot coffee in the previous decade and had paid more than half a million dollars in settlements**, according to trial testimony cited by the Wall Street Journal. 



 Liebeck's injuries were hardly minor. She suffered third-degree burns on her thighs and groin area, was hospitalized for a week and had to undergo painful skin grafts. **Before filing a lawsuit, she wrote McDonald's requesting that it lower the temperature of its coffee and cover her uninsured medical bills and incidental costs of about $20,000. McDonald's offered $800**.



 Later, as the case neared trial, a mediator recommended that McDonald's pay a settlement of $225,000. The company refused. 



 Jurors ultimately awarded Liebeck $160,000 in compensatory damages and about $2.7 million in punitive damages. "The facts were so overwhelmingly against the company," one of the jurors told the Journal. "Their callous disregard was very upsetting," another said.

 Just a note, neoliberals != liberals.  Neoliberals are people who espouse laissez-faire trade policy --- i.e., typically conservatives. 




 But not everyone does, and the result is a society with an enormous number of gun deaths.  I like to drive fast and I haven't been in any accidents.  It doesn't mean I should have the right to drive 150 through a school zone. 




 As a comparison, British citizens are 100 times less likely to be shot by a police officer than Americans: http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2014/08/armed-police 




 Surely, that's meant sardonically. 




 Insults not withstanding, you haven't shown anything to prove your case. 









 That is not what the article says.  You're reading the conclusion you'd like to see.

 Police officers get that benefit of the doubt at every step along the way. 

And

 The lack of serious second-guessing is baked into the system.

And

Still, even that low-end estimate suggests that police shoot and kill someone in the United States more than once a day, on average. The overwhelming majority of those killings are deemed justified before the case ever reaches a jury.

And

Meanwhile, as FiveThirtyEights Ben Casselman has argued, prosecutors rely on the police to do their jobs day in and day out, so they have few reasons to prosecute a cop aggressively and plenty of incentive to present a less persuasive case than they might otherwise, consciously or not.

And 

  Those cases certainly exist, even if they are likely more uncommon than is generally accepted.... In reality, its a wonder that any cop ever gets indicted for killing someone in the line of duty.

Say the opposite. 









 And even then, who knows what prosecutors tell a Grand Jury?  It's not enough.  There needs to be a special prosecutor appointed when cops are accused.   



















 I think it's a Hangouts thing.  It is built to use as much CPU as possible.  It's offloading compute to the clients. 









 On Chrome or Safari, it practically pins all the CPUs.  

Lots of people are seeing it: https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=hangouts+cpu+usage 




 I want good voice/video.  Hangouts is horrendous - it's impossible to receive calls, and absolutely chews through battery (1% per minute on my 2.5GHz Quadcore 2015 Macbook Pro).  Skype, well, Microsoft managed to make the UX even worse, didn't they?

And group chat/video is critical, especially for work, so I think this could be a really important entry into the field.  These guys know what they're doing.
 









 Interesting, thanks for the clarification. 




 Agree that insisting on a specific outcome in a specific case when the facts aren't known isn't productive.  However, this is a teaching moment, and this case falls into a broad pattern.  It's very much worth pointing that out. I was pretty disgusted with the righteous, near-racism here on Reddit when the prosecutor gave his extremely unusual defense of the person he was supposedly prosecuting.  The real story is that cops keep getting off and prosecutors keep protecting them, so I think it's worth getting that story out. 




 It's not a coverup, it's business as usual.  If there's a conspiracy, it's one that happens all the time, and is to be expected when colleagues are in charge of policing each other.  In fact, [while grand juries *almost always* indict, they frequently don't when the defendant is a police officer.]( http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/ferguson-michael-brown-indictment-darren-wilson/ )

Ironically, the right - which is constantly warning of Obama's jackbooted government thugs coming to take their guns away to Kenya - wants to change the conversation when the left points out systemic issues leading to an actual police state.  

Prosecutors shouldn't be in charge of prosecuting their direct colleagues.  The glaring conflict of interest is producing the expected result, and the obvious moral hazard means cops act with impunity.  This isn't speculation - it's fact, and a situation which is being repeated constantly for obvious, logical reasons.  Body cameras are only a part of the solution. The next step is a law requiring  special prosecutors to deal with police criminality.  

 




 But I thought a grand jury needs to indict him, and that you can't call two grand juries for the same case (or does double jeopardy not apply here?) 





























 I've got to agree with you.  The dude who got shot was aggressively pushing the door open against the officer.  His behavior looks pretty clearly threatening to me. 




  That's up to the grand jury and eventually regular jury that will presumably hear this case.

He said without a trace of irony.
 














 But he still keeps that 2% carry, amirite?   














   And the need for CEOs that can make good decisions is very fucking high while the supply of good CEOs that can make good decisions is very very low. It's always simple supply and demand.

[High paid CEOs perform poorly](http://thehill.com/policy/finance/319221-report-high-paid-ceos-performing-poorly ).  Just like this guy did.

A better explanation for these exorbitant pay rates is that [the incentives are misaligned](http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/great-men-great-pay-why-ceo-compensation-is-sky-high/2014/06/12/6e49d796-d227-11e3-9e25-188ebe1fa93b_story.html ).  Specifically, the people who set the pay of CEOs are themselves CEOs, very often people who sit on each others' boards.  Even in the case where the mutual benefit isn't this direct, CEOs have a strong incentive to set high pay rates to drive up the market for CEO pay.  There's are strong incentives for back scratching. 




 Drive down the central valley and you'll see two kinds of signs: for Republican candidates and complaints that the government is not doing enough about the drought.  The irony. 




 Oblivion was a really solid scifi film, IMO - great script, great acting, and concept - but why didn't it succeed?  I'd put it in a category I'd call 'concept scifi'. Cypher,  Existenz, and Enders Game are good examples I'd put in this category.  Less successful examples (IMO) are Dark City  and Primer.  All of these films (the great and the not so great) have plots which  on a reveal which comes toward the end.  They're reminiscent of  Twilight Zone or Outer Limits or some classic Star Trek episodes.  The viewer is suspended in a state of confusion about what is happening until the conclusion, which if it's done right, can be mind-bending.

One might think a film like Edge of Tomorrow would qualify, but there's not actually a sudden reveal --- the "trick" of the world the protagonist inhabits is obvious from the earliest scenes, and his progress to understanding the solution is a gradual process that involves a clear goal.  The concept-scifi films I mention lead you along a path and suddenly change the terms with the reveal.  I have no idea why EoT didn't do much much better than it did --- it should have, IMO.  Maybe it didn't have enough emotional touch points, which the public seems to crave.  Chalk that up as another reason we can't have nice things.

I suspect that concept scifi has an even worse problem, however --- the world it presents is a false one, and it holds the viewer in that falsehood for a large part of the duration of the film.  The result is a kind of alienation of the viewer from the world thats presented.  The film maker is basically on the hook for presenting an uncomfortable world in which something is "off".  I suspect that for a lot of viewers instead of that being intriguing, they experience dissatisfaction, an unease which isn't resolved by the puzzle pieces coming together at the end of the film.

It's a shame.  I love these kinds of films, and wish there were more of them.



 in that it had an austere, alienated quality to it.  I loved it, and wish there would be more like this.  Honestly, I can't for the life of me figure out why EoT didn't do better.  But there it is.   









 Bernie is terrific on the issues, serious, no bullshit, and could show that uncomplicated left wing politics is the key to winning back the white working class.  Bernie would have to defend socialism, of course, but I think he'd do it expertly, and wingnut heads would explode when they found people (a) didn't care about the label and (b) agreed with his policy positions.  That would go a long way to puncturing the red-baiting right wing bullshit we've had to listen to these past 40 years. 




 Reagan fooled gullible Americans into cheering for trickle down economics. Truly and honestly, I don't see anything to praise about that.  Con men, after all, are charismatic.  We don't need a con man of the left.  We need someone who speaks truth and fights for what counts.  The right has never given us a leader like that.  They had to invent a fiction around Reagan.  Let's not play into their rhetoric by offering that criminal actor our praise. 














 I hear what you're saying, but for me it was obvious what Reagan was from day one.  And honestly, he was *hated* as evidenced by his terrible approval ratings.  After his death, the Republican propaganda machine kicked in to rehabilitate his reputation.  Let's not play into that fabricated meme.  Reagan was a lying and hated ideologue of the right who brought us the war on drugs, trickle down economics and had the most scandals of any President, with more officials in his government indicted or convicted than anyone else.  That's the only story that needs to play regarding him. 




 Let's put it this way: We need an FDR.

Fuck Reagan and the poisonous horde that worships him.

 [Optimal Tip-to-Tip Efficiency](http://www.scribd.com/doc/228831637/Optimal-Tip-to-Tip-Efficiency )

A probabilistic model is introduced for the problem of stimulating a large male audience.  Double jerking is considered, in which two shafts may be stimulated with a single hand. Both tip-to-tip and shaft-to-shaft configurations of audience members are analyzed. We demonstrate that pre-sorting members of the audience according to both shaft girth and leg length allows for more efficient stimulation. Simulations establish steady rates of stimulation even as the variance of certain parameters is allowed to grow, whereas naive unsorted schemes have increasingly flaccid performance. 




 Definitely a click-baity title, but there's substance towards the end:

 [Bitcoin miners] are stuck... in a catch-22: they can't afford to keep mining, but they can't afford to stop mining, either. (This, coincidentally, is the same dilemma that oil drillers who borrowed a lot during the boom face now during the bust). This has already forced one big mining group into default. And it's forced the rest to sell the only assets they haveBitcoinsto pay back their dollar debts. That, of course, only pushes the price of Bitcoin down even further, which makes even more miners sell their Bitcoins to pay back they owe as mining becomes more unprofitable. And so on, and so on.

 Bitcoin, in other words, is suffering a deleveraging shock like the one that hit our economy in 2008, but without a Federal Reserve to cushion the blow. That means this doom loop of debt and Bitcoin deflation could take prices down a lot further still. The only solace is that, in the long run, the system should self-correct, as miners drop out and mining gets easier.

 I'm becoming convinced she's not running.  It's too bad. 




 Also watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f519_LGjhCA 




 I thought we "need to look forward, not back", or does that only apply to war criminals? 




 It was a huge disappointment to see both of them take the position that they did.   




 Look at their histories.

Obama had literally no track record *at all* of fighting for progressive policy.  At Harvard Law, he was known for intermediating between two sides.  At Kerry's nominating convention he gave a famous speech "One America, not two Americas", which advocated centrism and bipartisanship.  During the primaries he praised Reagan, supported  immunity of the telecom companies which participated in domestic spying programs, supported conserva-Dem Joe Lieberman over the excellent progressive Joe Lamont.    Obama even said that supporters were misconstruing him as a progressive.  He made a point of saying that "there are extremes on both sides" that are not helpful.   The man made it as clear as day that he was a centrist.  Voters were not paying attention.  

Warren has had a *long* track record of fighting for the middle class.  She first came to public notice when, as a professor at Harvard, she gave a talk called ["The Coming Collapse of the Middle Class"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akVL7QY0S8A ).   It's worth watch in full.  Since then, Warren identified a part of the problem as the lack of accountability of the big banks, which allowed them to privatize their gambling risks and socialize their losses.  She pushed for a new Federal agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which makes regulations preventing financial institutions from cheating consumers.  Republicans prevented her from becoming head of the agency, but she won that major victory.  That agency is estimated to have saved consumers some billions of dollars in excessive charges (too lazy to provide a link, but easily googleable).  She has been extremely sharp-tongued in calling out Republicans.  She has not said "both sides are the problem".  She has even called out Obama and his centrist nominees, recently scuttling Wall Street stooge Antonio Weiss.  She's fought for cheaper loans for students ("If banks get .75%, why can't students get that too?").  Just do a bit of research on her.    The woman is a progressive firebrand that Obama never was and never said he was. 



















 So many fucking racists on Reddit now.  It makes me want to leave.  Fuck these mainstream Americans or whatever the fuck they are. 




 Jesus, that isn't obvious?  Now we know for near certain that he's a criminal sociopath, and most likely walked from a murder conviction because the victim was black. 




 Big f'ing difference.  Warren has a track record of actually fighting for economic populist issues.  Obama has a track record of triangulation and bipartisanship.  From his very earliest days he praised Reagan, talked about "One America, not two" bullshit, supported Joe Lieberman over progressive Ned Lamont, supported immunity of telecoms from prosecution, etc.  Obama made it clear pretty early that he saw it as his role to bring left and right together, not fight for progressive goals. 




  edit: I guess people do, it is dumb though

Why?  It's a pretty standard political phrase for identifying a faction in a political party by their ostensible leader.  

E.g., "The Ted Cruz wing of the Republican party". http://newsbusters.org/blogs/tim-graham/2014/12/30/washpost-conservatives-slam-ted-cruz-wing-gop-too-much-clarity

And it's pretty much undisputed that Warren is seen as the leader of the progressives.

 Domestic spying, shielding financial and war criminals from prosecution, and getting Democratic partisans to defend these ideas will be his legacy.  Not race. 




 He bailed out the banks against the wishes of his base.

 Obviously, it won't in the short run.  But nobody is going to vote for weak-sauce Democrats who are wanna-be conservatives.  The South used to be a place of populist workers movements, and they voted for FDR.  There is no party that speaks to them now because of DLC third-way Democrats like Clinton and Obama.  Wingnuts tell them that they are disenfranchised because of social programs.  Until we have Democrats who tell the other side of the story, we'll never make big wins. 









 **Submission Statement**

A more nuanced look at the issues, delving into the backgrounds of the attackers, the role of the Iraq war (the attackers were radicalized by it, but Charlie Hebdo argued against it), and the hypocrisy of double standards:

  Under French law, the magazine could run cartoons mocking Islam, but it could not run cartoons mocking the Holocaust. In fact, in 2009, Charlie Hebdo fired Maurice Sinet (known as Sin), one of its most famous cartoonists, because of a column in which he suggested that Nicolas Sarkozys son would go a long way in life after marrying a Jewish heiress. But murdering cartoonists will not put a stop to double standards. 

 




   I don't think anyone should be surprised that when it comes to opinions on the middle east, Al Jazeera is not your best source.

Evidence? 




 How does this article show that Al Jazeera is biased? 




 Oh great, the main right wing organ in the most far right country on Earth slices and dices the text from the emails for maximum Hasbara, and it gets voted to the top in Reddit.

Please read the actual emails.

 Defending freedom of expression in the face of oppression is one thing; insisting on the right to be obnoxious and offensive just because you can is infantile, Khadr wrote. Baiting extremists isnt bravely defiant when your manner of doing so is more significant in offending millions of moderate people as well. And within a climate where violent response  however illegitimate  is a real risk, taking a goading stand on a principle virtually no one contests is worse than pointless: its pointlessly all about you.

 And I guess if you encourage people to go on insulting 1.5 billion people about their most sacred icons then you just want more killings because as I said in 1.5 billion **there will remain some fools who dont abide by the laws or know about free speech** [sic].

 What Charlie Hebdo did was not free speech it was an abuse of free speech in my opinion, go back to the cartoons and have a look at them! Salem later wrote. It snot [sic] about what the drawing said, it was about how they said it. **I condemn those heinous killings, but IM NOT CHARLIE.**

And lets remember that Al Jazeera has been repeatedly targeted by the US military and the Israeli IDF in attacks which killed their reporters.  Not a peep from the "free speech solidarity" crowd on that.  In fact, just this past year, the same French politicians organizing the Hebdo free speech rally suppressed a pro-Palestinian march during Israel's recent bombing of Gaza.

The hypocrisy is ripe.  Of course Al Jazeera journalists are going to be a bit peeved. 




 Well that certainly has a familiar ring to it. 









 That last link - holy shit.  I'd like to hear Sam Harris talk about why Islam is objectively "more evil" in that context. 




  Greenwald is rarely worth reading and this is not one of those rare occasions. 

YSK, leading off with an ad hominem attack against a journalist who broke the biggest story of the past year is not exactly a winning rhetorical strategy.

  To imply that publishing the cartoons means automatically embracing their content is nonsense. They are integral to the story, just like at the time of the Danish cartoon incident, as a reader I wanted to see the pictures to understand what angered people so much about them.

He said nothing of the kind.  He's talking about people who are advocating publishing the offensive cartoons *in solidarity*.  And, yes, that is a thing, in case you haven't noticed.

http://money.cnn.com/2015/01/07/media/charlie-hebdo-attack-journalists-solidarity/

https://www.change.org/p/editors-and-journalists-around-the-world-publish-charlie-hebdo-s-mohammed-cartoons-in-solidarity-with-the-victims-of-censorship-and-violence

 Greenwald is attacking a strawman here, sure a few people said we have to celebrate the cartoons,

Simply incorrect, CNN and many other outlets have noted (above).  

And even it were true, the people that Greenwald specifically mentions are not some fringe voices.  They are major figures of American political discourse.  By your standard we should mock anyone who responds to an idea presented in a NYTimes OpEd because it's "just a few voices".  

 How about not portraying one extreme as the public consensus and and entirely ignoring the rest of the spectrum?


I don't understand what you're getting at.  Could you clarify?

  Claiming you support freedom of expression and show solidarity and at the same time deciding not to publish the full story because it might offend part of your audience sounds empty at best. 

You've either completely missed Greenwald's point or are purposefully mischaracterizing what he said.  He's talking about people publishing the offensive work *in solidarity*. 

And his larger point is how utterly biased is this free speech solidarity.

Please let me know why there no outpouring of solidarity to republish Palestinian journalists when Israel killed 17 journalists just last year, an IDF officer even defending the attacks in the NYTimes saying:

 Such terrorists, who hold cameras and notebooks in their hands, are no different from their colleagues who fire rockets aimed at Israeli cities and cannot enjoy the rights and protection afforded to legitimate journalists.

Or when the US purposefully bombed Al Jazeera buildings, killing reporters.  Not a peep from the guardians of vaunted Western Values on that one.

 And let's not get into that marginalized minority bullshit,

See above.

  Implying this feeds into France's alleged foreign policy goals and attacking Harris - which is Greenwald's way of masturbating - who wrote an entire book against Christianity, didn't support the Iraq war

Sam Harris has stated that Islam is intrinsically worse than all other religions.  Ignoring history - two decades ago, ex-Hindu atheists committed the most terrorist attacks of anyone, and during the Islamic golden age, it was Islam that preserved the legacy of rational thought while western Europe was wallowing in its Inquisition.  Yeh, Sam Harris deserves zero respect at this point.

On the other point.  Try a bit of [research](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=+france+iraq).

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/france-iraq/

 




 Honestly, I think Sam Harris had it coming.  His argument is myopic and ahistoric in the extreme. Hitchens had a much better and more nuanced criticism of modern Islam and its problem with free speech, which I tend to agree with. 




 Huh?  Are you saying Greenwald is  advocating *banning* something?  That is completely backwards --- he's a passionate free speech advocate.  And I'm certainly not advocating that either.  The question was whether *ignoring* is the "adult" thing to do --- see the comment I'm responding to.   




 He does not use the word 'racist' or 'racism' a single time in that article. 









 Speaking as an atheist who tilts toward anti-theism, I'd say that there's more to the issue than that.  

It's worth reading Greenwald's commentary of the week's events  in full [here] (https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/01/09/solidarity-charlie-hebdo-cartoons/ ).

 This weeks defense of free speech rights was so spirited that it gave rise to a brand new principle: to defend free speech, one not only defends the right to disseminate the speech, but embraces the content of the speech itself. Numerous writers thus demanded: to show solidarity with the murdered cartoonists, one should not merely condemn the attacks and defend the right of the cartoonists to publish, but should publish and even celebrate those cartoons. The best response to Charlie Hebdo attack, announced Slates editor Jacob Weisberg, is to escalate blasphemous satire.

 Some of the cartoons published by Charlie Hebdo were not just offensive but bigoted, such as the one mocking the African sex slaves of Boko Haram as welfare queens. Others went far beyond maligning violence by extremists acting in the name of Islam, or even merely depicting Mohammed with degrading imagery, and instead contained a stream of mockery toward Muslims generally, who in France are not remotely powerful but are largely a marginalized and targeted immigrant population.

Is it right to simply ignore hate speech directed at marginalized minority populations?  I'm not so sure that just ignoring it is the adult thing to do. 

  it is simply not the case that Charlie Hebdo were equal opportunity offenders. Like Bill Maher, Sam Harris and other anti-Islam obsessives, mocking Judaism, Jews and/or Israel is something they will rarely (if ever) do. ... The vast bulk of their attacks are reserved for Islam and Muslims, not Judaism and Jews. Parody, free speech and secular atheism are the pretexts; anti-Muslim messaging is the primary goal and the outcome. And this messaging  this special affection for offensive anti-Islam speech  just so happens to coincide with, to feed, the militaristic foreign policy agenda of their governments and culture.

 









 Did you read the article or any of the actual statements made in the Al Jazeera emails?  

 And I guess if you encourage people to go on insulting 1.5 billion people about their most sacred icons then you just want more killings because as I said in 1.5 billion there will remain some fools who dont abide by the laws or know about free speech, he wrote.

 I condemn those heinous killing, but IM NOT CHARLIE, he wrote.

How is that a dissent based on irrational beliefs?

It's also worth noting that we've seen no such outpourings of support when Israel defended its killings of 17 Palestinian journalists this past year. An Op-Ed to the NYTimes from an IDF officer read:

 Such terrorists, who hold cameras and notebooks in their hands, are no different from their colleagues who fire rockets aimed at Israeli cities and cannot enjoy the rights and protection afforded to legitimate journalists.

Is this culture worthy of respect?  Or is the United States worthy of respect it deliberately targeted and killed Al Jazeera journalists?  Where was the outpouring of support for the vaunted Western values of free speech back then?

I think it's pretty reasonable for Al Jazeera journalists to be a bit disgusted by Western hypocrisy on this issue. 




 TIL Muslim is the new Communist. 




 That's up to Democrats. 




 I can't disagree with the spirit of this -- which is to say we need strong progressive leader*s* (not just one leader), but if you mean to defend Obama as "powerless", I have to disagree.  He has the power of appointment and serves as the de facto leader of the Democrats, and his choices have been abysmal.  


 




 The lesson of Obama was that we need leaders who have strong track records of fighting for progressive goals.  If the left in the US hasn't learn that lesson, they'll guarantee their irrelevancy ... and deserve it. 





























 Thanks, I'll check those out.  The book I had trouble with was actually Gravity's Rainbow, not CL49. 




 I apologize.  It's been many years -- I realize now that it was Gravity's Rainbow, not Crying of Lot 49.  It wasn't boredom so much as confusion.  I literally had trouble understanding what was going on or why I should pay attention to it.   I'd go through a few paragraphs and feel like "what did I just read"?  

 




 Thank you so much for that.  It's funny that this reminds me of how I describe Bergman's work to people who find it abstruse or pretentious.  In these situations the viewer/reader is trying too hard to read meaning into what is happening instead of experiencing the art on a moment-by-moment basis, similar to how we appreciate music.  

That is very helpful.  I'm going to try again.

Edit: Here's a link to some of my thoughts on Bergman from a long-ago reddit thread.
http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1fau0u/what_do_you_think_of_ingmar_bergman/ca8po7n 









 Slightly off-topic: I never got into Pynchon.  I tried like 5 times to get into ~~Crying of Lot 49~~ Gravity's Rainbow, but could never get past page 50.  Any suggestions? 




 [Vladimir Putin, Conservative Icon](http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/12/vladimir-putin-conservative-icon/282572/ ) 




 So many unsupported assertions.  What is the point. 




 A classic political move - get someone who protects your flank and articulates your position to the other side. 




  That is an incredibly grim and depressing outlook... which is of course the right attitude when analyzing American politics.

On the other hand, she's incredibly smart, and probably quite well informed on the basic issues.  All of the top candidates prep for these debates, and she'll have the best advisors to bring her up to speed on details. It's also possible that she'll have an economic analysis of what's happening at the global level -- who wants what and why. 

In any case, I doubt this is going to be an issue in the primaries.  In the general election, she'll inoculate herself by choosing an appropriate running mate who fills out the resume.  E.g., Wesley Clark, or ... here's a crazy, not-so-crazy idea - Colin Powell.

And on the other other hand, this TNR piece argues that the fact that she's said so little is a strong indication that she's not running:
http://www.newrepublic.com/article/119965/elizabeth-warrens-foreign-policy-positions-are-mystery. 




 George W. Bush had foreign policy experience?  Or Obama?  Or Bill Clinton? 














 But, by using the present tense (even when prompted), she's explicitly leaving the door open.  I hope she runs.  

 




  We have all the transcripts, evidence, instructions, and testimony.

And they point to a pattern of a prosecutor who biased the proceedings in favor of the officer.  This prosecutor also made the *highly* unusual move of calling a press conference in which he essentially argued for the defense.  Numerous commentators have discussed the questionable behavior of the prosecutor in this case.  As Jeffery Toobin (who holds rather right wing views on civil liberties issues) noted, ["reserving this kind of special treatment for white police officers charged with killing black suspects cannot be an appropriate resolution."](http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/use-grand-jury ).

 More importantly, this would give everyone else in any other grand jury freedom to voice whatever they want. Names, places, documents, etc. Who cares? Why are they being forced to secrecy in a grand jury when others aren't?

No - the unusual circumstances of this case, not least of which involve the strange behavior of the prosecutor suggest that the public interest is served in this case, and this exception is in fact provided for by  law.  This is made all the more urgent by the fact that [this prosecutor has a history of misleading grand juries](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/marjorie-cohn/prosecutor-manipulates-grand-jury-to-shield-officer_b_6240578.html ).

 I googled your percentages and can't find support for them.

99.99% of the time, grand juries indict:
http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/11/24/the-single-chart-that-shows-that-grand-juries-indict-99-99-percent-of-the-time/

Police are indicted between 1% and 3% of the time, according to this Politifact estimate:

http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/nov/25/benjamin-crump/lawyer-ferguson-case-99-time-police-not-charged-de/

Actually, it's a known Wilson supporter who is suspected of lying, and McCulloch put her on the stand knowing she was likely lying:
http://www.aol.com/article/2014/12/16/new-information-reveals-witness-40-may-have-lied-during-her-gr/21117109/

  Its because no matter the circumstances, prosecutors will take a cop through the grand jury for every shooting.

I am not aware of that.  Do you have evidence of this?

 And since you lack a valid argument, you decided to just wave your waves and call the person that was politely discussing with you "anti-American".

1. As detailed above, I think my argument is quite valid.  

2. You weren't just "politely" discussing the issue, having accused the people on the other side of having a "bullshit political agenda".

3. I think you need to go back and re-read what I wrote.  I qualified my statement with an *if*.  You could easily answer "I do think this should be investigated, but lifting grand jury secrecy isn't the right way to do it". 




 The history is written.  It was a war crime.

 The great majority of Iraqis who died in the war were not innocents and were fighting on the wrong side.

LOL.  

And George Bush made a secret pact with Hitler and Aliens before he invaded.  No proof needed by these debate standards, amirite? 




 Are you sure it's not the prosecutor who has a bullshit political agenda?

I think we need some light on why grand jury cases decide to indict 99% of the time except when the defendant is a cop, in which case the percentage drops to 1.3%.  The other thing that changes is the way prosecutors present evidence.  

If you think it's bullshit that we shine some light on this process, you are fundamentally anti-America. 




 First, I see you didn't answer the question:  What did Iraqis do that justified a US invasion of their sovereign territory?

Second, that 100K+ body count refers to Iraqi *civilians*.
 




 Why are *schools* involved in the first place...  

(i.e., Virginia is breaking from common practice.) 




 Interesting, I did not know that.  Nonetheless, the politics are deeply conservative, whether it's Ds or Rs, wouldn't you agree? 




 Not quite.

[This](http://www.bloomberg.com/visual-data/best-and-worst/most-underfunded-pension-plans-states ) Bloomberg dataset claims the worst funded states are:

1. Illinois (D)
2. Kentucky (R)
3. Connecticut (D)
4. Alaska (R)
5. Kansas (R)
6. New Hampshire (I)
7. Mississippi (R)
8. Louisiana (R)
9. Hawaii (D)
10. Massachusetts (D)

[New Hampshire is a swing state](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_New_Hampshire ), so I labeled it (I).

That gives:
R: 5
D: 4
I: 1

So it's pretty much a toss up.  




  We send Americans over to risk their lives killing people who kill innocent people

I think you've got it backwards.   100,000 Iraqis did what to us? 



















 He didn't make it "open" - in fact, [one of the jurors is suing the prosecutor](http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/grand-juror-sues-ferguson-prosecutor-over-darren-wilson-moratorium-20150105 ) to be allowed to reveal what actually did happen. 

 "Grand Juror Doe" is asking that they be allowed to speak about the grand jury case since McCulloch has presented a "not entirely accurate" portrait of the proceedings to the media, Mediate reports. 
 




  Nice argument: "She likes the police, must be a fascist"

Interesting that you resort to lying.  

You didn't say you "like police".  You said  that it's "immoral to criticize" them (your exact words), even when their behavior is violent and unconstitutional.   That is the *essence* of fascism.  


 I can say the same thing about you and how you support anarchism

No you can't.  The anarchist position is that there should be no authority.  No one here is arguing that.  They're arguing for the police to behave in accord with the fucking Constitution.  


 









 Let me put it simply.  Zed makes a career of being an asshole.  He may have a point about how K RC needs updating, but he purposefully does it in the most obnoxious way possible, then *whines* when people call him out for it.  Fuck this guy. 




 Oh.  Well, that doesn't make you anti-gay, but I'd throw a whole lot of findings from biology at you to show you it's natural. 




 I'm sorry, I still don't understand what is meant by "don't think homosexuality is a right".  The plain interpretation is that you think we should outlaw gay behavior. 

If you're trying to draw an equivalence between people who want to ban private consensual behavior and people who protest police brutality, you don't have an argument, I'm afraid.  The former *is* a form of bigotry.  People don't have a choice about being gay, as many scientific studies have demonstrated.  On the other hand, cops not only have a choice not to be brutal, they are also required to follow the constitution.  You're comparing apples and oranges.  Anti-gay is bigotry.

 




  ... if I don't think homosexuality is a right

Huh?  So people shouldn't be allowed to be homosexual?  That sounds pretty homophobic to me. Just a wee bit different from complaining about systemic police brutality.  People aren't protesting the existence of cops, after all, just their unconsitutional and racist behavior.

 




  Yes I do believe it's immoral to criticize the police. 

An idea that is at odds with a free society, but [consistent with fascism](http://www.rense.com/general37/char.htm ):

 12) Obsession with Crime and Punishment - Under fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations.



 




 Blacks are much more likely to be stopped and searched for drugs, [but are over 30% less likely to have drugs than whites](http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/voices/stop-and-frisk-not-just-american-problem ).

That's racism. 




 Some studies say [camelcase  snakecase](http://www.cs.loyola.edu/~binkley/papers/icpc09-clouds.pdf ), others say [snakecase  camelcase](http://www.cs.kent.edu/~jmaletic/papers/ICPC2010-CamelCaseUnderScoreClouds.pdf ).  Hmmmmm. 




 Fuck Zed Shaw and his crybaby antics.  I stopped paying attention to him after [the nonsense he wrote about Rails](http://harmful.cat-v.org/software/ruby/rails/is-a-ghetto ).  

Unfortunately, I didn't realize this was from ZS so I ended up reading it.  The guy basically flames K RC for writing a book back meant to explain how C works, back in the 70s, that doesn't take into account what was learned since the 70s.  Then he starts crying about people attacking him.  What a fucking asshole. 




 Yep, and to boot, property rights don't exist without that particular kind of socialism.  Take that for a spin next time you're debating with wingnuts. 









  Bold claim.  Source?

Police overwhelmingly target minorities in stop and frisk searches.  Well established fact.  Google it. 




 You are wrong - these programs  have been shown to reduce crime in low income neighborhoods.  http://www.afterschoolalliance.org/issue_briefs/issue_CrimeIB_27.pdf 









  hug and lollipops?

How about programs that have been shown to be wildly effective?  After school sports, summer jobs internships, etc. 




 So let me get this straight, you're arguing it's immoral to criticize the police?

You really missed your calling... as a spokesperson for the Stasi.



 



















  Regarding bipartisanship, many were sick of the divisiveness of the Bush presidency and wishing for a more unilaterally amenable figurehead who could serve as a unifying figure.

I'm arguing that this thinking *is* the problem.  Until the Left develops an appetite for fighting, it is doomed to fail.

  Does the President really have the power anymore to direct the country toward progressivism, or to fight against the establishment for the concerns of his base? I'm skeptical...

This kind of defeatism is simply maddening.  Modern Democrats seem to have become expert at excuse making for why nothing can be done, an attitude which guarantees the prophecy.  By this logic, FDR could never have existed - or perhaps should never exist in the future.  If this is the case, why bother at all?  This kind of reasoning is tantamount to saying -- "let the masters choose".

But obviously, no one actually believes this.  The argument of the [weak, helpless, impotent  Presidency](http://www.salon.com/2010/06/21/obama_137/ ) is one that is constantly trotted out by centrists to move debate to the right. Somehow, though, that never seems to apply to Republicans.  The reason billions are spent on Presidential elections is that there is real power there: the power to appoint, the power to raise funds, and the power of setting a message.  On all of these things, Obama has largely used his power to serve elites.  Sorry, but to make excuses for this is to be part of the problem. 

 I'd vote for a thousand Obamas before I'd give up and go for Nixon.

So you are saying, in effect, that you'd vote a thousand times for [someone whose policies are to the right of Nixon](http://www.alternet.org/newsandviews/article/641730/if_nixon_were_alive_today,_he_would_be_far_too_liberal_to_get_even_the_democratic_nomination ).  What is sad about today's left in the US is that they lack the historical context to understand how far they've allowed our politics to drift to the right.  For example, look at Nixon's record:

* He implemented the first significant federal affirmative action program.

* He dramatically increased spending on federal employee salaries.

* He oversaw the first large-scale integration of public schools in the South (something the crackers where I grew up were none too happy about).

* He proposed a guaranteed annual wage (aka a negative income tax).

* He advocated comprehensive national health insurance (single payer) for all Americans.

* He imposed wage and price controls in times of economic crisis. This wasnt a terribly good idea, but it was the furthest thing from a conservative idea. Truth is, it was positively socialist.

* He indexed Social Security for inflation and created Supplemental Security Income.

* He created the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the Office of Minority Business Enterprise.

* He promoted the Legacy of Parks program.

* He appointed four Supreme Court Justices. Three of them voted with the majority in Roe v. Wade.

He didn't shield criminal bankers and torturers from prosecution, like Obama did.  He didn't push austerity policies, as Obama did.  He promoted universal care, instead of scuttling it secretly as Obama did.  He expanded Social Security, while Obama put together his famous [cat food commission](http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2010/08/obamas-cat-food-committee-alan-greenspan-and-dancing-grannies-medicare ).  Progressives really need to wake up and stop reflexively defending establishment figureheads.  Kneejerk partisanship hurts us. 




 I think you're wrong about what the country was ready for.  Time magazine ran a cover portraying him as [the second coming of FDR](http://img.timeinc.net/time/magazine/archive/covers/2008/1101081124_400.jpg ).  A generation of new voters believed the message of Hope and Change and wanted to see a vigorous articulation of liberal policies.  Instead, we got Obama whose conservatism has dragged the Overton window far to the right on issues of torture and elite accountability.  His genius as a right wing leader is to have gotten much of the "Left", if one can call it that here in the US, to defend policies of bailing out financial institutions and giant corporations, failing to prosecute torturers and corporate criminals, vastly increased domestic surveillance combined with executive secrecy, a war on whistleblowers, and an absurd commitment to austerity economics at precisely the time all mainstream economists said we should do the opposite.  

Arguably, Obama has done more to unify our political discourse over far-right wing values than Reagan, his hero.  The result, predictably, has been an opportunity squandered --- a generation disgusted with both parties, and Democratic partisans who are now espousing policies far to the right of Nixon.  But to discuss that as a squandering of opportunity is fundamentally misconstrue what happened - rather, we should say he seized it, because he is, and should be regarded as, a right wing hero, who followed in the footsteps of Reagan.

All that said, I very much agree with much of the rest of your comment. Let's run someone who has a long track record of actually fighting for regular people.   




  Elizabeth Warren is right of Obama. 

Pure Hogwash.

 She's a Israeli loving a former Republican.  Paid for politician like them all. Only Sanders has been consistent for 30 years+.

You must have missed [this](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/in-the-loop/wp/2014/08/20/answering-question-on-israel-bernie-sanders-tells-townhall-hecklers-to-shut-up/ ). 




 Quite right - the reliable partisan voter makes one thing clear: he can be ignored without any consequences. 




 E.g., Israel. 




 Until progressives learn to nominate fighters they are doomed to lose. 




 You are right to ask me for that source, but I cannot provide it.  I distinctly remember posting it here on Reddit back in the primaries, and discussing it extensively. I have tried, in vain, to find it. 




 Agree that there's a difference, but Obama is not by any stretch *moderate*.  He is a right wing conservative.  He's [to the right of Nixon](http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/obama-is-a-republican/ ) on any number of issues, and [it's arguable that he's to the right of Reagan](http://my.firedoglake.com/cenkuygur/tag/ronald-reagan/ ).

 




 Mmm... nothing makes conspiracy theories better than spelling mistakes.   I am convinced! 




 Share your frustration with Ds, but you should read this:
[Differences between the Democratic Party and the Republican Party](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/2pwhvt/the_differences_between_the_democratic_party_and/ ) 




 I hope she does too, but Sanders is excellent. 




 I am talking about the primaries. 




 That is really great.  I have a lot of faith in Sanders.  He has a long career of being an unabashed fighter for regular people.  I've sent money several times.  I'm still waiting to see whether Warren will throw her hat in, simply for the reason that her messaging is sharper.  But either of them at the top of the ticket would be a great thing for the country. 




 I don't know what to tell you --- politicians are adept at telling people what they want to hear.   But his speech at Kerry's nominating was the first clue for me.  It argued, in essence, for bipartisanship, precisely the wrong idea in the face of growing radicalism on the right -- yet so many on the left foolishly ate that message up.  

I don't blame Obama.  Opportunists like him will always exist.  There is a reason that the neoliberals in the DLC got behind him.  They needed a friendly face on their agenda, and found someone who could reliably deliver it.  There will be another and another, because there is a market for it.  

IMO, the blame lies with the base --- they lack the desire to fight and to elect fighters.    Obama was an absolute cipher.  And to me,  an obvious fake from the moment he arrived on the political stage.   I can only look forward to a bleak 2016 cycle when clueless Dems will nominate Hillary, after she vomits an adequate number of lefty bon mots in the primaries.  If she wins, Democrats will dwindle into further irrelevancy, and the base will get what it deserves.

 




 I have no idea whether the left will ever learn the lesson of fighting for what it believes in instead of negotiating against itself before the battle even starts.  If Hillary is the next nominee, I'm officially done with the party. 




 It is the result of of years of dehumanizing rhetoric directed against Palestinians -   not unlike the techniques used by the Nazis. 




 Only people who weren't paying attention thought he was a progressive.  

He praised Reagan, he supported telecom immunity, he supported Joe Lieberman over the progressive Joe Lamont, he even said people were misconstruing him as a progressive.  People fooled themselves because they wanted to believe flowery words about bipartisanship instead of looking for a fighter.  They got what they deserved. 














 A fascinating article that argues Hitler had a mental breakdown after being exposed to nerve gas.  Historians, is this consistent with other sources?  How well accepted is this theory? 
























 Natural functioning of our beloved market economy: create scarcity, profit. 




 I agree with the spirit of this, but I think it's easily knocked down by conservatives.  "It's not the government's money, it's *my* money.  The government *steals* it from me through confiscation."  We've all heard that before.

A much more effective argument is to point out that money and property rights owe their very existence to government.  That's right --- modern property rights are, paradoxically, a form of socialism.  We take social resources from everyone and give them to the police and judiciary, who in turn provide a free service for people who are said to "hold property".  They get free guard service and they get free enforcement of their contracts.  

So, when a billionaire is said to "earn" their wealth, it should be pointed out that the only way they can so unfairly divide profits between themselves and their workers is through the magic of contracts, and state protection for contracts is a free  socialist service, which specifically benefits the wealthy.  Another way of talking about that is to ask "Why should we pay to protect WalMart confiscatory contracts with its workers?" 














 This link is garbage - a bunch of 1 sec long video sequences edited together.   



















 **Submission Statement**

How Vice is sourcing all of these way-out-there stories is beyond me, but they've been killing it, IMO.  As Americans increasingly serve a smaller number of masters, I'm sure more than a few fantasize about getting away from it all.  This dude took that idea all the way, and apparently quite happy.  In his words, 

 I love this peace more than anything.  I may not have belongings, or enough food or water, but I'd take this peacefulness over them any day. 














 Please tell me that's a screen protector and not the original plastic cover. 




 Seven upvotes.   Tango down. 




 The behavior of the police toward the mayor pretty much exemplifies their mindset: they are never wrong and anyone who doesn't kiss up to them like they are some kind of authoritarian demigod deserves punishment.  It doesn't matter that Eric Garner's killing was on tape.  It doesn't matter that  99.99% of people get indicted by grand juries, but copes never do, it doesn't matter that they effectively report to the mayor.  

They think they should never be questioned - on the street or in public debate.  That is a seriously fucked up mentality. 














 Cf. the [Big Lie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_lie#Usage_in_Hitler.27s_psychological_profile ).

Notice how the fuselage rotates - if you think of the wings as one long piece of spaghetti, the short piece over the fuselage rotates like the middle of the spaghetti.

It is a frequent trope of conservative debaters to claim that Republicans, "the party of Lincoln", have the proudest list of achievements as champions of civil and worker's rights.

 Agree, Communism also wasn't implemented properly.

 Ok, which one of you is this.

  "But Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), in her jihad against Wall Street,  seems determined to devalue this accomplishment  and to make financial expertise a mark of shame for Democrats, rather than a source of pride."

Hard to take the author seriously after that opening.   




 In what way has MoveOn been peculiar?  You seem to be suspicious of everything, but you're not providing any evidence.  MoveOn has been raising $1M to convince Elizabeth Warren to run.  Or is she now part of the secret libertarian plot to take over progressive politics too?  Full disclosure - I'm friends with one of the founders of MoveOn, and I can assure you that no such thing is happening.  




 Upworthy was started by  Eli Pariser, Executive Director (i.e., non-profit CEO) of MoveOn.org, and is a co-founder of Avaaz.org, another very well known left wing site.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eli_Pariser 




 I haven't seen a single article espousing neoliberal economics on Vice.  CATO/Reason/Federalist are rife with that stuff.  

They both publish anti-police brutality / anti-drug, but that could as easily signal progressive/liberal politics. 




 Vice is not Libertarian, not in the American sense. 




 So your best argument is the rantings of a [criminal](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-09-28/felon-forecaster-blogs-on-8-6-year-economic-cycles-after-11-years-in-jail.html ).  Cool story, bro'.

 Martin Armstrong is a self-taught economist who is starting to build an Internet following from an almost-empty office across the street from Philadelphia City Hall. Hes also an unrepentant felon who spent 11 years in prison for cheating investors out of $700 million and hiding $15 million in assets from regulators.  
























 none - Sanders does, though 




 I'll believe a candidate who has a track record of being on the right side of issues their whole career, not one who is merely saying the right things at the right time to the right people.

Hillary's record has been one of siding with giant corporations.  Obama said a lot of things to please the ears of progressives during the primaries too.  People didn't pay attention when he was supporting telecom immunity (for spying) and Joe Lieberman over a progressive.

 














 In the words of George W. Bush.  ["Uniquely American, idn't?  That is fantastic."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIjo-dWE1Jg ) 














   These are deeply personal attacks and criminal accusations, and I think it's incorrect to immediately grant them credence because you disagree with ~~O'Reilly's~~ someone's political views.

True.  That is the kind of thing the right wing does.

 Thanks for the pointers to Fandor and Mubi!  Exactly what I was looking for. 




 What do people do now when they get a hankering to watch any of the huge number of  popular flicks that aren't on streaming?  I can't bear shelling out to iTunes each time.

I brainstormed a bunch of favorite films, and then annotate which are available on Netflix streaming or not (I'm pretty sure most of these aren't available on Hulu/APV/Crackle):

* The Matrix (any of the trilogy)  - not available
* Hidden Fortress  - not available
* The Good the Bad and the Ugly - not available
* Vertigo - not available
* Sexy Beast - not available
* Divorce Italian Style - not available
* Lynch's Dune - not available
* Fifth Element - **available**
* The New World - not available
* Birth - not available
* Gosford Park - not available
* Barry Lyndon - not available
* The Royal Tenenbaums  - not available
* Jurassic Park - not available
* Lord of the Rings - not available

I honestly did this off the top of my head.   Just one film I could think of was available.

I'm one of the [10% that still has a Netflix DVD subscription](http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jul/22/netflix-dvds-mail-subscription ) for this reason.  How does everyone else do it?  Or is the answer that a lot of films simply just aren't seen anymore by the vast majority? 




 Why is it necessary to keep trade agreements secret from the American people including the staff of elected Senators and Congressmen?  Why are our elected representatives not allowed to review the details of TPP with experts?

**EDIT**: Obama will say that the details are not secret, but this is purposefully misleading language.  Senators and Congressmen are technically allowed to view the bill, however, only they may view it.  They may not even bring staff members or experts in with them into the secured room in which the agreement is kept.  

The TPP is several thousand pages long, yet the only people who can view it, Congressmen and Senators,  may not take copies or even notes of what they read.  So Obama is saying that it is not "secret" in only the most narrow and technical sense.  He ought to be called out on this.  Why the need for this secrecy?  How can democracy work when the details can't be reviewed by experts?

Here are some good write ups of problems in TPP, based on leaks:

* The EFF documents a litany of digital rights issues https://www.eff.org/issues/tpp
* Senator Warren and others have pointed out that the international court which the TPP establishes allows corporations to bring complaints that would effectively override domestic laws.

 So take a look at this comment: http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/356qkt/i_just_purchased_the_2012_macbook_pro_because_its/cr1vglo

How do you go about getting access to that content.  Every film I could think of wasn't available but one. 




 What do people do now when they get a hankering to watch any of the huge number of  popular flicks that aren't on streaming?  I can't bear shelling out to iTunes each time.

I'm going to brainstorm a bunch of favorite films, and then annotate which are available on Netflix streaming or not:

* The Matrix (any of the trilogy)  - not available
* Hidden Fortress  - not available
* The Good the Bad and the Ugly - not available
* Vertigo - not available
* Sexy Beast - not available
* Divorce Italian Style - not available
* Lynch's Dune - not available
* Fifth Element - **available**
* The New World - not available
* Birth - not available
* Gosford Park - not available
* Barry Lyndon - not available
* The Royal Tenenbaums  - not available
* Jurassic Park - not available
* Lord of the Rings - not available

I honestly did this off the top of my head.   Just one film I could think of was available. 




   That limits DVDs on their most fundamental level of "watching shit".

But my concern is the content.  Much of the streaming catalog is shit, by design of the movie industry.  They limit availability of a lot of the good stuff *on purpose*.  So DVD/BlueRay is the only way to get it.  People who rely only on streaming are either watching not very much or watching shit.

Obviously, I'd prefer a full catalog in streaming format.  And I agree with you about plastic discs - I can't bear keeping those things around. But I want to have access to a full catalog without feeling the pain of the purse each time I want to access something that isn't available on streaming (ie no to iTunes).  I'm just a bit surprised that more people don't feel this way. 




 So I'm a technology guy who has built a bunch of web and mobile systems over the years, I wrote a computer language, and am currently leading a team building a video ad marketplace.  

That bit about DVDs not disappearing is taken a bit out of context.  I mean that the business interests provide a reason for DVDs to continue to exist, not that technology can't address the problem.

So the truth is I'm probably quite a bit more technically savvy than many of the people commenting here.  I'm kind of crazy about video, which is why I want access to any and all content. 

I guess I'm a bit surprised that people are willing to accept technological limitations to what content they consume.   




 Thanks for that link.  Here's the bit that resonates with me:

 As well as the option of a film night, of course, it's also nice to have a choice of films you actually want to watch. The paradox of Netflix's successful transformation from a DVD rental company to a streaming video firm is that as its star has risen, the selection has got worse. The company's switched its focus from film to TV, where the rights are cheaper and standards are lower (admit it, you'd never watch a film half as terrible as that reality show you binge-watch religiously). It has started making high-quality original series, in an effort to steal some of that HBO shine. And it's perennially fine-tuning its recommendations algorithms so that the more obscure films it can afford to license end up in front of the right people.

TL;DR I've seen most of the good stuff on streaming.  I'm not a technophobe, but I guess I am cheap (i.e., can't bear to rent on iTunes). 




 Interesting.  I'm really surprised by this.  

So how do people get access to the full catalog of movies now?  I get like 3 DVDs a week from Netflix.  Do people just not watch as many movies now?  I guess the non-streaming catalog is effectively dead for most people?  Or do they spend a lot of money on iTunes?  At 3 movies a week, it seems like that would be quite expensive.  I mean there are tons of new releases that don't get onto streaming for *years*.  

I understand now that I'm in a tiny minority, but I'm also still completely puzzled.  What is normal user behavior? 




 Three times a week.  I'm kind of surprised that people are satisfied with the Netflix Instant/Amazon Prime Catalog.  So little of what I want to see is available on those. 




 How do you get access to all the movies that aren't streaming?  Netflix Instant is a tiny catalog. 




 What is a TV? 




 I think Apple's decision to provide *no* new models with an integrated drive is terrible.  There is no remaining product (other than this soon to be discontinued line) which supports what I imagine must be a fairly common activity: watching Netflix DVDs on your laptop.  

Using an external DVD drive doesn't cut it. The common situations for this: on an airplane, in a car, in bed make this a clumsy solution.   The other option - ripping the DVD - seems equally terrible.

One could argue that DVDs are going the way of the dinosaur, but I'd beg to differ.  The reason they still exist is not technological -- it's that way because of business interests.  Studios make money by limiting the availability of content.  DVD rental is an end-run around this lucrative system, so I find it hard to see how DVDs are going to disappear.  If you want a large catalog, you need easy access to DVDs.

Am I missing something?  Are there any good options?

**EDIT** "2012 Hardware", that is, according to the Apple rep I spoke to. 




 Looks pretty guilty to me. 




 Enforcement of contracts and protection of private property are a service provided by our justice system.  The people who benefit disproportionately are those who own property.  Protecting those "rights" is what allows a family like the Waltons to do very little work but extract the great majority of the value produced by their workers.

 




 Free protection services for contracts and property - police, judges, the whole legal system - is an entitlement... one mostly enjoyed by the rich.

 Looks like Maddow is part of the Clinton inevitability crowd.  

"Senator Sanders, let's talk about Hillary Clinton"

 




 Please, please peel back a few layers and find fossils. 




 I think you're looking at it the wrong way.

If he were elected, he would have a massive mandate. *Despite* massive money arrayed against him, the people actually chose him.  Despite years of red-baiting propaganda, people became so sick of the cheating that modern capitalism represents, they chose a Socialist.  Such a tactic would embolden Democrats that there is another way. 

As President, Sanders would essentially be the head of the Democratic party, and be able to support progressives over conserva-dems in elections (the opposite of what Obama has done the past several years).

As President, he'd have the bully pulpit to drive the conversation around issues that matter and speak plainly about the origins of our problems.  Conservadems like Obama took the energy of the left and turned it into disgust and cynicism.  

But Hillary is willing to lie for the duration of the primaries, much like Obama did, and Wall Street has her back because they know she's lying, and we'll all accept that because --- apparently, she's "electable". 

And thus does American politics continuously slide ever further rightward. 




 The lying Wall Street-serving harpie is electable.  Let's elect her.

 The perfect price of a movie ticket, from the consumer's perspective is $0.  And, that's not a ridiculous statement -- that is in fact the proposition that PopCornTime and internet bootlegs offer.   

So the question is - why are they saying any price higher than that ?   They are likely not saying this is the *most* I'd be willing to pay (because movie ticket prices are much more than that and ... everyone goes to the movies at some point or another, right?).  

Perhaps the consumers are thinking that it must cost *something* to make a movie, so they guess a price, but how are they in any position to know this?  The person who could have a meaningful opinion is someone who understands the finances of movie making.  They've just picked a number, which from a movie maker's viewpoint,  might be as ridiculous as saying "$0.01 is a good price for a ticket"?  In other words,  people are being asked to make decisions on something they can't make good decisions about.

So what exactly are we learning from this?
 




 It's definitely fun - a classic thriller.  I wish I hadn't seen it so many times already :) ! 




 Many great suggestions here, but some of my all time faves are missing.  

Here are some I consider must-see films (on any list).  I think these each represent the greatest work by each of these directors:

1. Hidden Fortress (Kurosawa) - the inspiration for Star Wars.
2. Black Orpheus (Camus)
3. Contempt (Goddard)
4. Divorce Italian Style (Gremi)
5. The Seventh Seal (Bergman)
6. La Strada (Fellini)

I would have put Night of the Hunter up here, but someone already mentioned it.

And now some other fun ones, concentrating on things you may not have heard of:

7. The Game
8. Kwaidan - 3 incredibly beautiful Japanese horror stories
9. Sanjuro / Yojimbo (Kurosawa) - inspirations for Clint Eastwood's  "Man with No Name" classic films.
10. Seduced and Abandoned (Gremi) - if you enjoy Divorce Italian style
11. Spellbound (Hitchcock)
 




   Keep in mind that Criterion isn't just a "great films" collection.

E.g., Armageddon.

 The question is why did HipChat not own this market?  They were there first with a very similar application.  I used HipChat at a couple of workplaces and it was infuriating.  Notifications were constantly lost.   I'd get a notification open HipChat and it would clear all the notification badges.  I missed so many messages this way.   It was impossible to tell when I should pay attention to something.  My coworkers and I even tweeted at the HipChat team asking them to fix the issues.  Crickets.   

Slack paid attention to the details.  It's an indispensable app, especially for coordinating with remote teams.   My company has 5 locations all over the country and only 25 people.   Slack makes it work.

 Lets remember that this nice old german lady whom the "commoners" choose to lavish with love is the world's top landowner in terms of space and value.  These monarchs managed to keep their title to vast lands by permitting a Parliament, but it only has power to the extent that it doesn't challenge the Royals' claims to their property.  It's a brilliant bargain - they get to continue having the same ownership that they enjoyed before "democracy" while also having the power to dismiss any of the peasants elected representatives.   

It is actually illegal to even speak against these landowners.  In N Ireland, high treason (punishable by life imprisonment) includes the following offenses: 
* attempting to deprive the monarchy of their title
* publishing that the sovereign is a heretic, tyrant, infidel or usurper of the Crown
* doing anything which might disturb or interrupt the sovereign's possession of the Crown

Yet the British peasantry have come to love them.

 Yet even this could be interpreted both ways.  From a conservative point of view, "Big Government" is the problem.  From a liberal point of view, "the state of government" (especially the Republican congress) is the problem.  

The poll shows respondents naming "dissatisfaction with government" as one of the commonly named problems, which leaves me confused.  This is so terribly worded.  It's hard to know what is meant.  Are people saying that "prevalent feelings of dissatisfaction with government" are the problem?  Or are they saying that "an overreaching Big Government" is the problem?  Or are they saying that the dysfunction of government is a problem?

 Israel has a sophisticated ethnic cleansing strategy.  Instead of a mass purge, which they know would draw worldwide condemnation that even the US could not ignore, they deprive segments of the population of basic necessities and human rights in focused doses.  The world pays less attention, but they have time on their side.  This is ethnic cleansing by attrition instead of by pogrom.  The effect is the same. 




 It has a little bit to do with who has disposable income and who pays whom to have careers in politics.

 I should be clear - the video does a very good job at explaining Weber's ideas.  I'm criticizing Weber.  His attack on Capitalism is highly interpretive, very much in the spirit of  early 20th century sociology.

 Agree, but in some places the numbers who want Sharia are also quite high (see this other chart from that article):
http://www.pewforum.org/files/2013/04/gsi2-chp1-3.png

For example, in Egypt, 74% want Sharia, and 86% of those favor the death penalty for apostates - that's 63% of the population (!!!) 




 Some specific examples and quotes would help.

I literally cannot find any definitions of the sort you've given.  And then, there's the problem that the definition is vague.  You seem to be saying that some currencies are a function of the USD - so by pegged you actually mean "partially pegged".  

Anyway, it's really impossible to discuss this further without specifics.  You said "almost all" currencies are pegged to the USD.  What is the specific definition of "pegged"?  (Not a reference to some author who wrote something somewhere at sometime).  And what *specifically* are the countries that fall under this definition?

I've asked several times, and all I'm getting is hand waving.

 




  even when the polls show unambiguously that the majority support such barbarous things as the death penalty for apostasy. 

Wow.  Do you have a link?

Edit: I just learned about Google.

And the very WTF result you mentioned:
http://www.pewforum.org/files/2013/04/gsi2-chp1-9.png 




 I can't find anyone who uses the definition of pegging that you do. 




  Just because something is "pegged" to the dollar does not mean it is economically static.

Yes it does.  That's what pegging is.  
http://money.howstuffworks.com/exchange-rate4.htm

 A pegged, or fixed system, is one in which the exchange rate is set and artificially maintained by the government. The rate will be pegged to some other country's dollar, usually the U.S. dollar. **The rate will not fluctuate from day to day.**

http://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Currency+peg
 Importantly, fixed exchange rates do not change according to market conditions. It is also called a pegged exchange rate. 




 I think this says something different than you think it does.

 This action, referred to as the Nixon shock, created the situation in which the United States dollar became a reserve currency used by many states.

Being a reserve currency is *entirely different* from being a reference currency.  While pegging requires reserves, having reserves does not entail pegging.  

And the  bit you quote even says many previously fixed currencies  became free floating as a result of Bretton Woods, not the other way around. 




  Just about every currency in the world

Not true. It's mainly the oil-producing countries that do that:
http://www.investmentfrontier.com/2013/02/19/investors-list-countries-with-fixed-currency-exchange-rates/

 Bahrain,Jordan,Lebanon,Oman,Qatar,Saudi Arabia,United Arab Emirates,Venezuela, Hong Kong, Cuba, Panama, Eritrea, Djibouti, Bermuda


They're pegging their currencies to the dollar because the US has forced the world to buy oil in US dollars.  This boosts demand for the US dollar, increases its value and makes it more stable.  




 I don't reject the theory of low expectations, that's certainly a possibility, but I think other factors are at play too.

Saudi Arabia is worse on almost all human rights issues than other Islamic or Arab countries.  Even if low expectations mute criticism of Arab/Muslim countries, we'd expect the Saudis to at least get proportionately more criticism than Iran, Saddam Hussein's Iraq, and Syria.  So low expectations cannot be the whole answer.

I think the differentiator is the role of the press.  Saudi is largely kept out of the news because it is not in the interests of western officials to antagonize the dictatorship.  Official enemies like Iran, Saddam's Iraq and Syria are regularly castigated.  Journalists tell the stories of their leaders, and so the public in Britain and America hear bad things about our enemies, but not about the House of Saud, the unsurprising result of having a supine press which is largely reactive to the agendas of elites.

In Israel, the ongoing war has created a narrative independent of official western proclamations.  What is remarkable is that despite [western journalists'  biased coverage  in favor of Israel](http://timeswarp.org/testing-for-bias/ ) --- western populaces have seen through the ruse, perhaps because the obvious morality of the situation belies the official propaganda.  The house of Saud can hide their crimes as long as their land is untouched by strife.  Israel, unfortunately, has those pesky Palestinians it has stolen land from. 




 Saudi Arabia is allowed to do what it wants because the dictatorship has agreed to peg oil to the US dollar.  The deep relationships with elites in the US don't hurt either. 









 [This Annenberg study](http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1070 context=asc_papers ) concludes that it is has a strong pro-Israel bias.  Here is a [summary](http://timeswarp.org/testing-for-bias/ ). 




 **EDIT**: funny, less than one minute after I submitted this, I get a downvote.  Oh but my fans sure are speedy readers!
- - - - - - 

But - did *you* see the movie?  You asked me, I gave you specific reasons.  You could have refuted them.  Had I ignored, you might conclude you're beating a "dead horse".  But you didn't.  Instead you ignored what I wrote and told me I "post nothing but left-wing stuff".  It's not clear how these non-sequitors are supposed to change anyone's views.  

With regards to Frank Rich, and with my respect, I'd say that he's got an odd analysis of a critical issue.  Look at this passage:

 I would hardly call this film an endorsement of that war; its an endorsement of the Americans who volunteered to fight it. If anything, Sniper is the very opposite of a recruiting poster for further American military adventures in the Middle East. 

Rich is referring to PTSD issues and the horrors of war suffered by the soldiers. This certainly makes the film more interesting than most, but the deeper message is still reflexively pro-American.  American motives are always pure, and the suffering of the killers on our side is always noble.  American Sniper effectively glorifies the suffering of one of our sociopaths, and asks us to feel sympathy for him.

Indeed, Rich even acknowledges the relentlessly one sided perspective in the next sentence:

 The Iraqis are xenophobically and all but uniformly presented as duplicitous, indistinguishable savages (in Kyles lingo) unworthy of American sacrifice. 

Glorification of military members is a propaganda technique employed to put our military -- and by proxy our military adventures outside the reach of criticism.  A good summary of this argument is [here](http://www.salon.com/2014/11/09/you_dont_protect_my_freedom_our_childish_insistence_on_calling_soldiers_heroes_deadens_real_democracy/ ).  Unlike most of the more simplistic pro-US military films (i.e., [literally any which show US military planes and battleships](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2004/09/operation-hollywood )), this Eastwood effort represents a more cunning and noxious form of propaganda.  

From a moral perspective, it presents a pretzel-like logic, getting the audience to feel sympathy for the killer because of the stress he feels from all the killing he did, but none for those killed, a story still yet at odds with the reality in which the actual protagonist thrilled in his murders.  Eastwood is an incredibly talented filmmaker, and he's used his skills to teach Americans (yet again) to love and honor their military, to shed tears for them, instead of doing what they should: demand that they be held accountable for their actions and question the morality of enlisting in the first place.  
 




 And [the thoughts of that veteran](http://abcnews.go.com/US/tomas-young-iraq-war-veteran-antiwar-activist-dead/story?id=26846330 ) would run counter to the false narrative that Clint Eastwood and the rest of the GOP want to push. 




 **EDIT**: Bring on your downvotes.  You definitely don't have any arguments left to defend this propaganda garbage.

- - - - - - - - 
I did.  Did you?  It doesn't feel like it.

From the very first scene, the sniper is presented as someone who wrestles with moral dilemmas - do I shoot the kid who is carrying an RPG or not?  His buddy tells him he's going to be sent to jail if he makes the wrong call (for shooting a man who it is strongly implied is coordinating an attack against a US convoy).  The made up version of Kyle doesn't take the shot.  The very next scene we see the hero" Kyle as a boy learning from his father the  lesson about standing up to bullies, that we are told none too subtly is his life "purpose".

Either you haven't seen the movie or this heavy handed propaganda message isn't obvious enough for you: we're being educated that the US military and its agents are good moral people doing only what is necessary, the kind of people who "stand up to bullies".  Shortly thereafter, the twin towers come down... the themes are blunt and ideological, and serve their purpose.

The truth is the American military hides war crimes, invades countries pre-emptively, and its sniper-hero is actually a hate-filled racist sociopath who bragged that killing was something he "loved", who said everyone was a "bad guy",  "I hate the damn savages", and  "I could give a flying fuck about the Iraqis".

But, since it's important not to expose the American public to what the war and its "heroes" actually are, propaganda-Kyle is presented as a great guy with a hot girlfriend who just wants to "do my job when the day comes".  When the twin towers coming down, our newly married hero is off to confront the "bullies" who apparently did this to us in Iraq.  

And then there he is killing the little boy and his mom.  He was forced to, don't you see.  And the supine American audience drinks in the message: the American military is *forced* to kill all those civilians.  They try as hard as they can to avoid collateral damage, but they're sending their wives and kids to kill our anti-bully brigade!  All the while, Kyle makes kill after kill of bomb-carrying Arab, nearly getting sick after each shot, so moral and feeling a man is he.  Quite the opposite of the reality, of course, but such are the standard tools of trade of a propagandist.

The bullshit is thick in this one, but Americans are so full of it at this point that it smells like roses.

 Portraying a lying sociopath as a military hero is what I'd call noxious propaganda, not "a good movie".

 It's called shamelessly scoring political points.  The Obamas are inoculating themselves against the jingoist rage that is constantly simmering beneath the surface of the American right. Embracing the lies of a sociopathic war criminal is a way of signaling, in the perverse reality of American politics, that they are truly and unquestionably patriotic.  The anti-war left is so obliterated and hopeless, that they can do this without shame or cost to their reputations. 




 Haaretz: [What exactly did Goldstone 'retract' from his report on Gaza?
Richard Goldstone's strange op-ed, in which he backtracked on his report claiming Israel targeted civilians, does not seem to be grounded in the UN's final report on Cast Lead.](http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/features/what-exactly-did-goldstone-retract-from-his-report-on-gaza-1.355454 )

 I asked Goldstone to help point out even a single word in the two reports that could justify his vague statement about the non-existence of the policy on harming civilians - while both reports repeatedly criticize Israel for not having investigated this issue at all.

 Apologizing politely, the South African freedom fighter said he had imposed media silence on himself.

We can only speculate on how this man was threatened. 




 Wow.  I hope they weren't just drinking too much coffee when they came up with this.   









 How is this off topic? 




 And look at what that did to pervert the priorities of his administration.  Not a single banker in jail, the too big to fail banks are bigger than before the crash, etc. 




 And they will be informed by Fox News that Obamacare took away their healthcare. 
























 Yet today, the reigning economic ideology asks us to suppress what nature has designed and be entirely selfish.  




  I don't think comparing the relative sizes really rebuts OP's arguments.

What arguments does it not rebut?

I assumed OP was arguing that the absolute values of these thefts tells us something about which currency is more secure.  *That* argument is pure bullshit, which the data I show above pretty conclusively demonstrate.

However, if you mean that OP has some *other* arguments, I might agree.  What are they?

 




 Markdown problem - I needed an extra carriage return.

Fixed now. 




 Can't find the tweets with Isabella Kaminska, so can only guess at your argument from what is posted here, which seems to be comparing the absolute numbers of the thefts to argue that fractional reserve is more risky.

But what do the absolute sizes of the thefts have to do with anything?

Euros in circulation = 956 Billion

Bitcoins in circulation = 3 Billion USD = 2.8 Billion Euro

**Stolen euros as a fraction of total in circulation**: 2B Euro /956B Euro = .2%

**Lost bitcoins as a fraction of total in circulation**: 5M  Euro/ 2.8B Euro = .17%

 




 Time to pull out the pitchforks. 




 Another possibility is that Republicans know exactly what they are doing.  Whether this costs us more *collectively* matters less than who ends up with relatively more after the distribution.  

When you look at their policies through the lens of labor exploitation things make more sense.  The more brutal and humiliating is the state of unemployment, the better deal an employer can make when signing a contract.  These fights are about the bargaining power of labor. 




 Let me add to that this  interview with one of the authors, which leads off with calling her a quack:

http://www.alternet.org/food/meet-controversial-mit-scientist-who-claims-have-discovered-cause-gluten-sensitivty 




 Not for black folks.

But that said, this particular guy was acting aggressively.  Perhaps police in another country might have handled this without gun violence, but the dude in this video was clearly threatening the officer. 
























 Krugman explains the standard Keynsian argument on this as "my spending is your income":
http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/01/opinion/krugman-the-austerity-agenda.html

Reducing income during a recession (what "austerians" advocate) cuts everyone's income, cuts spending, and further hurts the economy.

 A bunch of articles by Niall Ferguson. LOL.  Could you possibly choose a more thoroughly discredited source?

The Columbia Journalism Review: [Newsweeks Niall Ferguson debacle.  A misleading cover story gets the wrong kind of buzz for Tina Brown's mag](http://www.cjr.org/the_audit/newsweeks_niall_ferguson_debac.php )

Jonathan Chait's take down is particularly worthy of a read: [Niall Ferguson Fights Back Against Smear Campaign by Fact-checkers, Facts](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/06/niall-ferguson-fights-back-against-fact-checkers.html)

 Committing the odd factual error is an occupational hazard in journalism. For Niall Ferguson, the commission of error is more than a hazard. Its a cherished way of life. 

Well, at least Niall finally admitted Krugman was right: http://www.businessinsider.com/niall-ferguson-paul-krugman-was-right-2012-1

[Even GWB's Axis of Evil speechwriter admitted that](http://www.frumforum.com/were-our-enemies-right/ ): "Imagine, if you will, someone who read only the Wall Street Journal editorial page between 2000 and 2011, and someone in the same period who read only the collected columns of Paul Krugman. Which reader would have been better informed about the realities of the current economic crisis? The answer, I think, should give us pause. Can it be that our enemies were right?" 









 [Does that then apply to the Germans who are currently lecturing the rest of Europe?](http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-07-06/piketty-germany-has-never-repaid-its-debts-it-has-no-standing-lecture-other-nations) 




 So in other words, we should ignore your comment.'

Just curious - do you examine every URL on Reddit before you click it to make sure you're not lining the pockets of Krugman? 




 Krugman discusses the solution in the article.  Did you read it? 




 I did a searches for "austerity worked in europe" and "austerity ireland",  "austerity spain", "austerity portugal", and came up with results like the following.  These stories don't exactly make austerity look like a success.

http://www.irishexaminer.com/viewpoints/analysis/irelands-austerity-success-is-no-model-for-greece-340662.html

 GREECE is being told to follow Irelands crisis solution of harsh austerity and acceptance of bank-and-bailout debt. This narrative conveniently ignores that the Irish recovery has been built on major human rights violations and the undermining of long-term social and economic development.

http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/13/economic-austerity-ireland

But under the heartening symbolism of a free state restored, a host of troubling statistics remain, after five years of budgeting by bludgeon. Previously low public debt remains well in excess of national income, and although Dublin is currently proudly financing this through private means, any fresh bout of market jitters could send it back to the emergency room. The unemployment rate remains in double digits, and in a few short years, one young man in every 10 has left the country. The human toll has been devastating. 

http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/03/thousands-rally-spanish-anti-austerity-protest-150321200719255.html

 Spain is emerging from a seven-year economic slump as one of the eurozone's fastest growing countries, but the exit from recession has yet to ease the hardship for thousands of households, in a country where nearly one in four of the workforce is out of a job.

 Spain austerity: Huge Madrid protest turns violent

http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21653653-perhaps-surprisingly-anti-austerity-and-populist-parties-are-not-doing-well-austerity-without

 PORTUGAL is no country for young men. A third of the under-25s are out of work. Of graduates under 35 with a job, almost half earn less than 900 ($1,000) a month. This is the 500 generation, referring to the minimum monthly wage that many earn on short-term contracts in call-centres or supermarkets. Emigration is at levels unseen since the 1960s.

 ... Antnio Costa, the former mayor of Lisbon, who took over as PS leader last November, promises to turn the page on austerity, saying it has produced nothing but poverty. Despite the bail-out, he notes that the public debt has risen to 130% of GDP, a level many economists see as unsustainable. 



 




 Which ones are you thinking of?  I have family in Spain, and my impression is that it's been a disaster there. 




 Not my comment - it's a direct quote from the article.  Check the link from the word "arithmetic" in the actual article to understand the meaning of this. 





























 Lloyd Blankfein here. Where the hell is Hillary's Goldman patch? 




 You're not the only one thinking this:
http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/07/04/greece-isnt-the-first-country-to-have-a-debt-referendum-does-iceland-provide-useful-lessons/ 














 Ok, then.  From my own observation, everything that comes out of Steve Moore's mouth is a lie. 




 First of all, let's note that the author of this piece, Peter Rogof, is part of some far right wing public policy organizations "Let Freedom Ring" and "Frontiers of Freedom". He writes for National Review, Fox News' opinion section, and The Daily Caller,

So Politifact finds that conservatives are liars.  Two possibilities - Politifact has a leftist bias, or conservatives are liars.

Here's what Rogof says:

 The fact that, as the Lichter study shows, "A majority of Democratic statements (54 percent) were rated as mostly or entirely true, compared to only 18 percent of Republican statements," **probably** has more to do with how the statements were picked and the subjective bias of the fact checker involved than anything remotely empirical.

Emphasis mine.  I.e., Rogof doesn't like the conclusion, so assumes that Politifact is conspiring against the right.  

Here he is  quoting James Taranto in an attempt to refute Politifact:

 As the Wall Street Journal's James Taranto has consistently reported, the fact checking business often  too often for anyone's good  turns on matters of opinion rather than matters of "fact." 

Taranto is another right wing polemicist who is no doubt hurt that conservative statements are being shown in a negative light, so it's hard to take this opinion seriously.

Even the study, by another conservative (Rogof's professor) admits that Politifact pays equal attention to both Democratic and Republican statements.  

The worst the author can find is that "PolitiFact chose to highlight untrue statements made by those in the party out of power", but there's no evidence that this amounts to selection bias.  Around the same time the study came out, it was found that [Republicans get twice as much air time as Democrats](http://thinkprogress.org/media/2012/01/24/410742/sunday-morning-talk-shows-featured-twice-as-many-republicans-as-dems-last-year/ ).  By this metric, it could be argued that Politifact is biased *against* Democrats (possibly in an effort to show balance).  In fact, [some on the left allege just this](http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/political-animal/2012_01/politifact_keeps_falling_short034982.php ).

**TL;DR - this critique of Politifact seems to be nothing more than butthurt conservatives being exposed as liars**

 




 The problem is that austerity can't work:
http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/07/05/austerity-arithmetic

There's evidence that Merkel knew this. http://www.vox.com/2015/7/2/8883307/merkel-nsa-wikileaks-greek-crisis 

So why did they put the screws on Greece?  One hypothesis is that they want to get rid of the leftist government. 




 Interesting.  I just perused [his tax plan page](https://randpaul.com/issue/taxes ).

He sounds like a complete loon:

My tax plan would blow up the tax code and start over. In consultation with some of the top tax experts in the country, including the Heritage Foundations Stephen Moore, former presidential candidate Steve Forbes and Reagan economist Arthur Laffer, I devised a 21st-century tax code that would establish a 14.5% flat-rate tax applied equally to all personal income, including wages, salaries, dividends, capital gains, rents and interest.

Wow.  Same supply-side nonsense peddled by the same set of repeatedly discredited sources.  

Arthur Laffer's curve has been totally discredited, and has a couple of statements on politifact, one false and one half true.

Steve Moore on the other hand achieved a remarkable score: http://www.politifact.com/search/?q=steve+moore

* 3 pants on fire
* 3 false
* 4 mostly false
* 1 half truth
* 1 mostly true statement

I.e., 10/12 things this man says are falsehoods.


And then there's this.

 We now know that the IRS, through political hacks like former IRS official Lois Lerner, routinely abused its auditing power to build an enemies list and harass anyone who might be adversarial to President Obamas policies.

He needs to take his meds. 




 Thanks! 




 Who is that? 




 What  policy issues does your friend cares about that cause him to select Rand Paul? 




 Nicely done, sir. 









 This is different. Look at OP's submissions and comments.

And before you accuse me of being an Israel apologist, know that I've posted my share of Israel-critical commentary here on Reddit. 




 HA HA HA you are funny.

Please tell more jokes. 









 David Frum, GWB's 'Axis of Evil' speechwriter:

["Imagine, if you will, someone who read only the Wall Street Journal editorial page between 2000 and 2011, and someone in the same period who read only the collected columns of Paul Krugman. Which reader would have been better informed about the realities of the current economic crisis? The answer, I think, should give us pause. Can it be that our enemies were right?"]( http://www.frumforum.com/were-our-enemies-right/ ) 




 As GWB said, ["uniquely American, idn't it?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIjo-dWE1Jg ) 














 Donald Trump, like other white supremacists, is spreading hate speech.  The Charleston shooter didn't just invent his ideologies out of nothing.  Words have consequences. 




 It's a republished  Reuters article. 









 Hmmm... point taken.  I ought not to have repeated his name. 




  I think one of the biggest reasons to support her is the fact that the next president will likely nominate one, two or maybe even three judges to the supreme court (should they be a two term president). 

Yeh, I totally hear you on that.

 Forget all other issues for a moment. 

That is exactly what the DLC is hoping we all do.  It's a devil's bargain.

 Not voting or voting third party could easily hand the presidency to the GOP and we can't allow that to happen

You know, I'm genuinely torn on this.  On the one hand, you're absolutely right --- the Republicans will be a disaster zone.  On the other hand, so will Clinton --- just not as much.  And it's important we look at it from that perspective.  

The American system has been tweaked by wealthy elites so that we now have two parties which serve the same basic interests, with small variations between the two to give the appearance of choice, like Coke versus Pepsi.  The more similar the two are, the more hot and intemperate the debate becomes on the side issues.  

Gaming this out - if Clinton wins, it strengthens the hand of the DLC.  They'll argue that their economically right wing, hawkish policies are the only way that Democrats can win.  And the elites win again.

And from another perspective, pledging your vote to someone --- no matter what --- means that you've given up your bargaining power.  The reliable Democratic voter can be ignored.  That's why things keep drifting further and further right on the economic front.  

Rachel Maddow had a great think piece on this several years back: http://www.salon.com/2011/04/05/democrats_51/

 **The Republicans may not love their base, but they fear them and play to them.** The Democratic Party institutional structures of D.C., and the Beltway press in particular, not only hate the Democratic base  they think its good politics for Democratic politicians to kick that base publicly whenever possible.

 Only the base itself will ever change that.
 




 Yep, and no coverage of the Wisconsin speech, which was the biggest crowd by far for anyone in the 2016 race, but three articles on Clinton. 




 Donald Trump said almost the same thing as  the Charleston shooter before he gunned down 9 people.  It's now over two weeks since that speech. The reason no Republican came out and condemned him (notice Jeb had to be asked) is that the party is filled with racists, and they can't afford to piss them off. 




 Let me put it another way - women already deal with a lot of body issues.  A woman reading this thread (I'm a guy, in case you haven't already guessed) is going to see a bunch of men ganging up on a woman based on her looks.  And she is a CEO and was a partner at possibly the most prestigious VC firm in the world.

I mean - there are so many male CEOs who've done terrible things.  But the conversation never takes this turn for them.  For a woman looking at this thread, the message is loud and clear --- even a woman who has reached such a high level in her career will be subject to low blows. It's a culture of intimidation.

It feels like a bunch of animals in a feeding frenzy here.

**EDIT** Here's Sandra Bullock saying essentially the same thing:
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/07/01/sandra-bullock-women-attacked-in-media_n_7707290.html 




  What makes you think that the same couldn't have happened had it been about a man ? 

Because that *almost never* happens, whereas it constantly happens with women.  

 I get it the people are flinging way too much. On the other hand, people are rooting for /u/chooter . I suppose she is a female too.

Disagree.  That people in the community are rooting for one employee who happens to be female does not make misogynistic attacks elsewhere in the site ok.

 Do you think that all this shitstorm is just because she is female ?

Absolutely not.  Her lawsuit combined with her behavior towards other employees at KPBC, her husband's lawsuits and shady dealings all cast a shadow over her.  Her mismanagement as interim CEO then triggered the storm.  She should go.

There are lots of things to criticize her for.  Her sexual attractiveness is not one of them, and should not be.
 









 Dylan Storm Roof before he killed 9 people in Charleston, SC:

"You are raping our women and taking over the country."

 




 He's in sync with Republican voters. 




 No. [Backpfeifengesicht](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Backpfeifengesicht ). 




 Reducing a woman to her physical appearance is a form of misogyny.  It undercuts women's achievements and suggests that nothing is more important that their physical appeal.  Once we go there, it opens the door to all kinds of degrading commentary, for example:

 Maybe she takes it in the pooper like a champ. 

This whole thing on reddit is degenerating into a feeding frenzy.  Now, we're going after the basest kind of attack on  women.  I don't like what Ellen Pao did, but I'm so not on board with this shit.
 




 Not all Liberal issues are of equal weight.  To my mind, economic  and military issues are paramount, and Hillary is only slightly better than, say, a Mitt Romney on this front.  

Elites have managed to control the left by throwing them bones on social issues, while working doggedly to cement in place the neoliberal program.  Hillary Clinton is a part of this.  Her role will be to manage expectations of the left.  The money she takes from Goldman, Walmart and god knows who else, is to protect their interests.  Her behavior on TPP was absolutely disgusting -- giving the impression of opposition, while actually being one of the actors who was pushing it through.

We've had 40 years of this kind of behavior from Democrats.  In the long game, it leads to increased cynicism (look at voter turnout and ratings of our government).  I'm uninterested in another liar in the bully pulpit. 




 Some good supporting data here --- http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/07/04/no-puerto-rico-isnt-greece/ 




 Seriously 133 upvotes for this?  I don't like what Ellen Pao and her husband have done, but this thread is becoming pure misogyny.  Y'all should be ashamed of yourselves. 




 Painful how illiterate old media still is about the internet. 




 The paper has a pretty interesting take on this idea.  I couldn't do it justice in the title.   









  Show of hands: How many would prefer a replay of what Nader did to Gore?

Please explain your fear that the Democratic party will run two candidates for President.

 I feel so bad for them. 




 The only person telling the truth right now is Sanders. 














 I think he ought to get attention.  He represents the views of a significant faction of the Republican party --- he is second in the polls, after all. 

Let them own it.   




 I don't think it's possible to give this man too much attention.

Just ask him. 




 Ok, so are you saying that people of African descent are genetically predisposed to violence? 




 Just curious about the rest of your argument.  Do you believe that black people are genetically more predisposed to violence than people with other skin color, or do you believe that it is their culture?  I'm assuming you discount that poverty is an explanation.

seems a bit more likely than your theory. 









  Ron Paul was a niche candidate. Did you watch the videos of him being booed?

 I have! They're heart-warming.

Already this is pointless.  You're not reading any of the evidence I'm posting, making stuff up in response and giving me flip answers.

Like this - 

 assuming likely primary voters know his positions (which, at this point, they do!).

Just pure made-up nonsense.

== Sanders is still largely unknown (50-59% "haven't heard enough about him" to make up their minds).

Done with this thread.
 









  In the best-case scenario, this was mere oversight and some unintentionally poor editing. In the worst, it is an attempt to stifle opposition within the Democratic Party

I think it's something different, more subtle and more insidious.  The reporters and editors are part of the Washington insider culture.  They all tell each other that Sanders candidacy is something not to be taken seriously.  If someone suggests that his traction is an important story, they'll be greeted with a smirk.  That wouldn't be the case if it were Biden or O'Malley drawing these crowds, of course.  But that is how institutional bias works - weak minds are shamed into conforming. 














 Embarassed.  Busy day, on iPhone, etc.   




 Tweets are good too 




 In San Francisco, only personal experience.  Studies in other cities support my view though:

From a bike blog:

 Thirty-six percent of cars and 71 percent of bikes failed to stop, which averaged 60 percent non-compliance among all vehicle types. The difference between the behavior of people when they sat behind a steering wheel and when they sat atop a bicycle seat was significant: 34 percent more people disobeyed the law when they rode their bikes.

http://bikeportland.org/2014/06/05/lifestyle-column-observing-analyzing-portlands-stop-sign-culture-106867

Bikers are much worse for stop lights:

 The report [PDF](http://media.oregonlive.com/commuting/other/SCI%20201%20Project%202.pdf ) is available here, and shows that of the 497 cars observed only 36 ran red lights, while 58 of the 99 bicycles observed blew right through. That's about 7 percent of cars compared to 58 percent of bicycles.

http://www.citylab.com/commute/2011/12/uncomfortable-relationship-between-bikes-and-red-lights/623/

 




 Cyclists are *far* more likely to run through stop signs, though.  In San Francisco, there are definitely a contingent of self righteous assholes that flour traffic laws and act rudely toward drivers and pedestrians.  These people create a lot of bad will towards bikers.

**EDIT**: "flour"  "flout" 




  They were both incredibly popular niche candidates, loved by the fringe of both parties

*Ron Paul* was a niche candidate.  **Did you watch the videos of him being booed?** I notice that you haven't responded to that.  Ron Paul's main positions were *hated* by  huge swaths of  GOP primary voters.  
Sanders, on the other hand, takes positions that the Democratic base *loves*.  If you think I'm wrong --- **show me the evidence**.    And it's not just the Democratic base --- his policy positions line up with what the American public actually wants, but few in Washington speak about: http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2015/06/12/bernie-sanders-says-americans-back-his-agenda-and-hes-mostly-right/

Ron Paul came in 5th in Iowa with 10% of the vote.  Sanders is already polling second there at 33% to Hillary's 56%.  Also, you point out how Ron Paul was popular here on Reddit.  Notice how /r/politics is liberal?  Being wildly popular with a liberal audience might just possibly explain why he had trouble in the GOP primaries.

A [Zogby poll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Paul_presidential_campaign,_2008#Polling
 ) seems to confirm this - " However, Paul was first when Democrats and Independents were included in the survey."

The place where the two are similar is in recognition by the media, so I agree with you, Sanders has an uphill battle on that front.  But on the issues and alignment with the base and the American public, the two couldn't be more different.  Hopefully, that still counts.
 




  Ron Paul supporters also claimed that his views were massively popular, both within the GOP and the country at large. It's incredible how similar the campaign dynamics are

That is a pretty weak claim of similarity.  It's like saying "they both have gray hair too.  Will Sanders supporters not acknowledge this?"

The point is: read my argument again, and show us the polls.  Ron Paul *was* out of step with the GOP base on several core issues.  He was even booed on stage during the debates:

* [In South Carolina](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7v8qtZ3I5AM)
* [In Tampa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWnFKB9yL08)

The opposite will be true of Sanders.



 




 There hasn't even been a debate yet.

The primaries are won one state at a time.

He's jumped to 33% (compared to Clinton's 52%) in Iowa.
 




  because reddit is an echo chamber and none of these people are actually going to vote
 
Reddit and Iowa. http://time.com/3943994/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-iowa/ 




 Ron Paul took positions that put him directly at odds with the GOP base - on the military, the drug war and mass surveillance.  Sanders is the opposite -- he is voicing positions that are hugely popular with the Democratic base ([and the majority of Americans](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2015/06/12/bernie-sanders-says-americans-back-his-agenda-and-hes-mostly-right/ )).

 




 He has a lot of supporters in the senior demo, according to the NYTimes: http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/29/us/politics/bernie-sanders-campaign.html

 




 Sanders made it an issue in the primaries by releasing a statement that campaigns should be publicly financed.  Clinton then started releasing vague statements against Citizens United, but offered no plan. 









 There are reasons to view Clinton skeptically on this issue.

Just days later, [Pelosi capitulated and paved the way for fast track status](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/24/pelosi-backs-taa_n_7654954.html ).  In fact, [Clinton undoubtedly knew what many Washington insiders already observed](http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/white-houses-secret-weapon-on-trade-nancy-pelosi-118565.html ): Pelosi was actively looking to corral votes for TPP in a way that would minimize political damage.  That is how politics gets done --- dishonest insiders like Clinton are experts at misleading the base.  She got the benefit of appearing to be against TPP, taking soft positions, being vague, and ultimately inoculating herself on this issue for those who weren't paying attention.  As it turns out, though she tried to pretend like she was against it, [she was actually instrumental in negotiating TPP](http://www.ibtimes.com/hillary-clinton-trans-pacific-partnership-obama-aide-calls-her-out-tpp-past-1975980 ).

 Brutal.  Get rest!

Do you mean these Qunnipiac polls?

http://www.quinnipiac.edu/images/polling/ps/ps06182015_Sk32gth.pdf

http://www.quinnipiac.edu/news-and-events/quinnipiac-university-poll/iowa/release-detail?ReleaseID=2224

Sanders is still largely unknown (50-59% "haven't heard enough about him").  Still Clinton has commanding leads, and as retch-inducing as it is, 75% find her "honest and trustworthy".  What idiots. 




  The greatest public speaker of our generation

Where did you pull that one from? 




 I never thought Ron Paul had a snowball's chance in hell.  I grant that Sander's chances don't look great, but the fundamentals are quite different.   Ron Paul took positions that were diametrically opposed to the GOP base (and thus attractive to people here on Reddit).  Sanders takes positions which are wildly popular with the Democratic base, and which have been ignored for years by third way Democrats like the Clintons and Obama.  There is pent up demand for Democratic leaders to get back to their roots instead of being just another corporatist party.

From this perspective, the primaries are "in play" for Sanders much more than they ever could have been for Ron Paul.  He looked like the crazy uncle in the debates because *everyone* in the audience thought his positions were nuts.  That dynamic will be reversed for Sanders.  Clinton will be seen to be prevaricating and evasive on issues the Dems care about most.  

When they happen, watch the debates then compare with what happened with Ron Paul and then see if you agree with me. 




 No contest.  Those 300 channels of high def TV, cell phones and the internet are far less important than the security of knowing you can own a home and send your kids to school. 




 Interesting -- do you have a link to those numbers? 




 Ron Paul was at odds with the GOP base on surveillance, military intervention, the drug war and other issues.  Not so with Sanders. 




 Nope!   




 % was missing.  Sorry. 




 His platform is what the majority of Americans actually want.  Look at the numbers:
http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2015/06/12/bernie-sanders-says-americans-back-his-agenda-and-hes-mostly-right/ 




 She was the guaranteed shoe-in last time too. 




 Yeh, it was horrible - the middle class expanded and he had one of the highest approval ratings of any President. 




 Lots of people said a dude named Hussein wouldn't stand a chance after 9/11. 




 Only people who weren't paying attention thought Obama was a progressive.  During the primaries, he praised Reagan, built his platform on the idea that bipartisanship was the solution, sided with the telecom giants on mass surveillance, supported conserva-Dem Joe Lieberman over the excellent progressive challenger Ned Lamont, and even jested about how progressives were fooled in thinking he was one of them.  And the list goes on.  People who were paying attention back them pointed that out (I was one).  

 




 A guy named Hussein for President after 9/11?  

Nah. 














   I am not sure about are his support of universal healthcare (we're 10x the population of Canada, I don't think it's as simple as he thinks it is) 

How does the size of the country change whether universal care will work or not?

  I don't think it's as simple as he thinks it is) and what I think will be a permanent barrier to joining the upper class (huge taxes on $250k+ households, I think that number should be higher)

What are the specific numbers you object to?  To my knowledge he hasn't said what taxes he believes should apply to $250K+.  I know he's talked about taxes on the top bracket and mentioned the rate under Eisenhower, but he only ever used that as an example of what Republicans not too long ago considered acceptable.  His point: we had widespread prosperity under those conditions and we've drifted far to the right on this issue 




 The difference between him and Ron Paul is that Ron Paul was badly out of step with the base (and GOP donors) on a number of issues: mass surveillance, militarism and drug laws.  Sanders, on the other hand, is in lock step on all the major issues and the long frustrated desires of the Democratic base -- and to an extend, the American public.  It's a completely different story.  It's the reason he's drawing the biggest crowds of anyone in the race. 




 Let's get Sanders elected, then we won't have to cajole Clinton to "get serious" about climate change.  Her passions on the subject will only last the duration of the primaries anyway. 














 I think you're still not getting what I'm saying.  Protection of private property is not natural or given.  It tilts the playing field towards people who own property.  The Walton family can pay slave wages to people who do real work while they do very little real work because the government provides free protection of their property.  At the same time, the Waltons don't want to pay for universal health care, social security or other benefits.   




 You're misunderstanding me.  I don't believe in private police *at all*.  Quite the opposite.  My point is that the police are a socialist service that mainly benefits the rich.  The wealthy then turn around and hypocritically complain about socialist services which benefit the vast majority of the people --- like healthcare, free schools, environmental protections, etc.  

TL;DR Government ought not to provide services which disproportionately benefit the rich unless it also balances this with equal benefits for the rest. 




 Hmmm - I might agree with you.

Hillary has already started shifting her position on campaign finance and lobbying to win the primaries.  Will voters be sophisticated enough to understand that she only started saying these things after Bernie made them an issue *and* started getting traction?  Will they realize she'll drop progressive priorities after she gets elected like Obama did?  

I think Sanders's hypothesis is that he can activate people who've dropped out of politics out of disgust who will see his principled campaign as the only hope of avoiding, as he puts it, a slide toward complete oligarchy.  It's an unusual hypothesis to be sure, but some of the numbers --- the approval rating of Congress, low voter turn out, and the swelling crowds for his underfunded campaign --- suggest he might be onto something.  I agree, though, it's an unusual strategy.   




 You might be right, but  how does slinging mud win that battle? 









 I stand with the NRA in blaming the children for not carrying guns. 




 The most consequential socialist program of all is the police and judiciary.  They provide free protection for "private wealth" and contracts.  It is this free service that allows the Waltons to negotiate and maintain lopsided contracts with their workers, while they themselves do little real work.  Of course, the wealthy are big fans of that particular socialist program because it benefits them most of all. 




 He's drawing huge crowds because people are sick of the same old bullshit. 




 Could you unpack that a bit --- not disagreeing with you, just want to understand.  What are some examples of him assuming things about what people know, and how could he do better? 




 That's a sensible analysis, and without a doubt having the media and money on your side are a big part of winning the primaries.  However, another not insignificant part is whether primary voters actually agree with you.  This is where the similarities between Sanders and Paul break down.

Ron Paul, while wildly popular with Libertarian independents, took positions that put him at odds with GOP primary voters.  Namely, his positions on mass surveillance, drug laws and military intervention.  Large parts of the GOP base, and certainly the GOP money, found these ideas absolutely unacceptable - in fact, crazy-Uncle unacceptable.  Add to this the near total domination of right wing politics by Fox News, and it's hard to see how people ever thought he'd have a chance.

Sanders, on the other hand, champions policies which are what Democratic primary voters want, and this at a time when there is rising frustration with the direction the DLC leaders have taken the party.  Clinton's support for NAFTA, surveillance, war, and lobbyists put her directly at odds with the actual policy preferences of Democratic voters.  The "liberal" media, while still actually biased against Sander's brand of populist anti-corporate policies, is more diverse, and Democrats get their news from a wider variety of sources, many of which are online.  The debate is controlled, but less easily so on the Democratic side.  

**TL;DR Many of Paul's policies were controversial with the base, but the opposite is true for Sanders.  Also, liberal media is more diverse than on the right, so Sanders has a chance of getting his message out.** 




 I guess you think the President is the one giving the orders?  Interesting. 




 Yeh, we should only do that to Muslims. 




 A waste for her to be in the VP role.  Much more she can do as a support in the Senate -- or in a role in the cabinet. 




 In general, I agree --- Hillary has huge "view negatively" numbers, which will be very difficult, likely impossible, to erase.  Sanders is low because he is unknown.  Still, the challenge remains for Sanders to get the word out to those groups - as it remains a huge opportunity for him to boost his numbers and carry his momentum to the next level. 




 Clinton has 72% minority support versus 5% for Sanders. http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/bernie-sanders-surging-among-white-democrats-others-love-hillary-n369251.


 




 http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/bernie-sanders-surging-among-white-democrats-others-love-hillary-n369251
  In a new Washington Post/ABC News survey, 56 percent of white Democrats backed Clinton, while 14 percent supported Sanders. 


 **But among non-white Democrats (the survey did not break them down by ethnicity), Clinton had 72 percent support, compared to 5 percent for the Vermont senator.** 




 Griping about the media isn't going to get Sanders elected.  If we want to see him as President we should confront this challenge. 









 I guess people needed a /snark tag for that one? 




 Capitalism polls at 39%, Socialism at 36%. 




 Totally ridiculous regulations, in retrospect.   




 You should also take a look at this: http://www.nj.com/opinion/index.ssf/2015/06/like_it_or_not_sanders_socialism_is_mainstream_edi.html 




 You're arguing that Hillary is electable, so we should elect her.  But Clinton is a dyed in the wool neo-liberal, and many of her actual policy goals are directly opposed to core progressive values.  She believes in bailouts for bankers, mass surveillance,  deregulation and lobbying.  The electability argument is a canard that has lead to an ever rightward shift in our politics.  Clinton/Obama third-way Democrats have lead us to a point where the current Democratic Party is far to the right of Nixon, and Congress is viewed less favorably than cockroaches.

"Rape papers" and "socialism" seem like a joke compared to the litany of problems surrounding Clinton.  And let's remember that she has the highest net negative ratings of any politician currently running.  The inside-the-beltway media has poured it on thick to create an aura of inevitability around Clinton because she is one of them.  She is at her absolute peak now, and can only go down.  Negatives don't go away.  She's lost before (to a black guy named Hussein in the post 9/11 era, no less) and she will lose again.  On the other hand, the more people learn about Sanders the higher his numbers go.  Yes, he can and will win the black vote --- once they learn about what he stands for they will be his most loyal supporters.  It's just a matter of getting the word out.


 




 Quite right.  I welcome Hillary Clinton's lies! 




 He and Mika are perfect representatives of the Beltway nattering class.   









 Floridians voted for this shit. 




 LOL.  Thanks for proving my point.  
 




 So no police in your ideal world? 




 Being forced to buy something doesn't solve anything except affecting your right to self-determination. 









 When the government stops forcing me to pay for cops that help the Walton family protect their enormous wealth, I'll agree with you. 




 LOL.  Politico is desperate for an angle to throw cold water on Sanders.  




 Show them this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEM2iDT-VAk 




 Dammit - that was a good speech.  No one has talked like this man in my lifetime. 




 "Can't afford police and judges?  We'll force you to buy it then!"
-- the basis of our private property system.

 




 Don't forget that [she's a proud board member of Walmart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoCPRSrScG8 ).

And that she wants you to know [that she will continue to take money from lobbyists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaAkcXynqLA  ). Lobbyists "represent real Americans", and thinks that "the idea that somehow a contribution is going to influence you" doesn't apply to her.

 




 Don't be convinced by a terrible, short-sighted argument.  For example, consider [this](http://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/39aot7/bernie_sanderss_great_idea_free_public_college/cs2xyvx ). 




 The reason this is possible is the same reason that workers everywhere (blue and white collar) are having wages stolen from them: unequal bargaining power.  The rich have little need for money, so they can be all that more demanding in contract terms, which leads to workers giving up more of their labor for less, and the wealthy becoming wealthier *because* they are wealthy.

This is not a natural system --- it was created this way.  Wealthy right wingers argue that we should socialize costs for the protection of property but not for anything else.  Of course, this just happens to benefit them the most.  




 Who has articulated details of their policy positions at this stage? 




 Jail would be the preferred way to wreck Jamie Dimon's shit, IMO. 




 RTFA 




 The ability of Wall Street traders to "own" assets isn't free either.    It derives from the free protection given to property owners through our system of police and judges.  The state creates the ability for those trades to happen.  It ought to tax that non-productive economic activity. 




 If degrees aren't worth the time, people will stop going to college and start picking vocations.  But, currently, degrees *are* worth the time:

|        |         |        |       |
|------|-------|------|------|
| Type of Degree |	Annual Median Salary (2011) |	Gender |
|High school diploma |	$40,050|	Men|
|High school diploma |	$30,010|	Women|
|College with no degree|	$47,070	|Men|
|College with no degree |	$34,590	| Women |
|Associate degree |	$50,930	| Men|
|Associate degree |	$39,290	| Women |
|Bachelor's degree |	$66,200 |	Men |
|Bachelor's degree |	$49,110 |	Women |
| Master's degree |	$83,030 |	Men |
| Master's degree |	$60,300 |	Women |
| Professional degree |	$119,470 |	Men |
| Professional degree |	$80,720 |	Women |
| Doctorate degree |	$100,770 |	Men |
| Doctorate degree |	$77,460 |	Women |

What you're arguing for is maintaining the wages of high paying jobs by limiting the number of workers, and limiting those with access to those jobs to  the children of those who can afford to pay, which leads to an increasingly class-stratified society.  

In any case, both white collar and blue collar jobs will come under pressure as robots do more and more of work.  The deeper problem is that our economic system produces more than enough for everyone, but increasingly only a tiny few reap the rewards.  

Education is not just about creating workers for business owners to exploit.  That is only a relatively recent view that was put forward by conservatives in the 80s.  Personally, I think it is an extremely narrow and poisonous view.  It is worth remembering [what Thomas Jefferson said on the subject](http://politheo.com/thomasjefferson.html ):

 An enlightened citizenry is indispensable for the proper functioning of a republic. Self-government is not possible unless the citizens are educated sufficiently to enable them to exercise oversight. It is therefore imperative that the nation see to it that a suitable education be provided for all its citizens. It should be noted, that when Jefferson speaks of "science," he is often referring to knowledge or learning in general.
It is about creating a thoughtful and informed citizenry.  An educated citizenry capable of critical thinking is a precondition to a functioning democracy.  

That is what this bill is about.  The people of the United States should be smart, educated and rational regardless of their social station.  In an increasingly technological society, it is imperative that voters can understand and deliberate the issues of the day.  That may sound incredibly old fashioned, but just 30 years ago it wasn't.   




 Make a condition for public funding: a maximum student/teacher ratio. 




 The financial transaction tax is a good idea all by itself: http://www.newrepublic.com/article/120755/chris-van-hollen-financial-transaction-tax-would-curb-risky-trading 




 By this reasoning, we shouldn't pay for elementary and highschool so we can increase the value of these degrees too.   

The real answer is that we ought to have an educated workforce.  To the extent that the market isn't interested in those degrees, it will be a waste of time to pursue them, which will reduce demand for those degrees.  Free education is about creating a level playing field. 




 I'm liberal and think that Obama's record on surveillance is illegal, virulently anti-American and ought to be grounds for impeachment.  That said, WTF does it matter how /r/politics happens to have voted on that issue have to do with this thread?  Nothing. 

It's a separate issue - and you need to show stats.  How many posts have been submitted overall?  What is the likelihood that a post will hit the front page --- what if it hits the front page on a closely related reddit?  How many upvotes/user do Obama-bashing stories get on /r/politics versus r/news?  Bitching about some specific news item not getting traction is pretty meaningless. 




 RTFA. 









 I'm not a big fan of Dawkins, but this is little more than a hatchet piece.  No quantitation - just a lot of opinions of from the writer. 




 The guy who secured funding for the internet and identified global warming as a threat.  What a bore.

 He was known for silly gaffes, in a way that sometimes made him seem loveable and sometimes the butt of jokes.
http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/completelist/0,29569,1895156,00.html 




 Here are the examples he cites:

* a student(s) complained he debunked the idea that policies helping black people caused the housing crash
* a student(s) complaining that he "possessed communistical sympathies"
* an abortion debate being cancelled because it might imperil the "welfare and safety of our students"
* an Afropunk band's presence would not have been "safe and healthy"

Excuse me, but all of these sound explicitly like or hint at *conservative* oversensitivity, not a problem with "liberal students" as the title says. 









 I think he didn't attend the meeting where she told the rest of Wall Street she's just lying to win the nomination. 









 Snide idiots - they don't like that someone who's not part of the Washington insider crowd is attracting so much attention.  This is how they respond. 




 A famous economics news site:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_Hedge 









 Idiotic yellow-journalism bullshit from the NYTimes.

Sanders is out-raising and outpolling  many members combined of the Republican clown car, who mainstream outlets like this treat as Very Serious and deserving of reverence and respect.  Yet, we get this kind of sneering bullshit from "the paper of record".

They continue their descent into irrelevance.   
























 A master politician --- pat people on the head, make them feel good but say nothing. 





























  He is, in fact, leading a national-socialist movement, which is a queasy and uncomfortable thing to write about a man who is the son of Jewish immigrants from Poland and whose family was murdered in the Holocaust. 

Kevin Williamson is aghast, aghast, I tell you, that we somehow misinterpreted "National Socialist" as "Nazi".
 




  but is their movement and tactics beyond any criticism

Certainly not - it's a question of how one goes about reaching people.  Our goal is to get Bernie elected.  They may have an obligation to be more thoughtful and listen better and be more patient, as you say --- but, in the end, who has what obligation is less important than building bridges and getting allies.  

And, honestly, those of use who aren't black can't really understand o their experience.  What I do know is that being black in America is traumatic, and even if we didn't have the larger more important goal of getting the right person elected, we still ought to cut them some slack.  

**TL;DR Let's focus on building allies, not who is in the right or wrong**
 




 WaPo's original title.  They've corrected it. 














 Nothing could more perfectly demonstrate why Turing tests are meaningless. 




 Getting frustrated and becoming defensive isn't going to help Bernie get elected.  That is our common goal.  We need to understand where they're coming from --- reach out, embrace them --- admit the candidate's mistakes *and then* point out the good work he's done.  

Just dismissing BLM and calling the protestors childish (which I've seen several people here do) is a sure path to losing this crucial demographic - which is incredibly stupid because we are on the same side.  

I'm not black, but if I experienced a fraction of what black friends do in their daily lives, I'd be perpetually enraged.  A bit of understanding and humility goes a long way to creating allies.  That is what it's all about.  Let's stop complaining about our frustrations with others who share the same cause ---  and start reaching out instead. 




 Yeh, I agree.  I deleted it. 




 I.e., look at race and age rather than the candidate and the issues.  A sad state. 









  David Axelrod, the Obama campaign strategist who was a senior White House adviser during the crisis years, said Sanders-style criticism ignores the reality of the economic crash. There was a constant tug and pull between the need to discipline an industry whose excesses had triggered the crisis and keeping the system from collapsing, which would have exacerbated an already reeling economy, he said. Senators dont face such conundrums. Presidents do.

Too Big to Fail is an even bigger problem than before the bailout.  All David Axelrod is proving is why he and the rest of Washington need to be swept out. 




 Congress is less popular than *cockroaches* for God's sake. On the other hand, in poll after poll the American people agree with Bernie on the issues: http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2015/06/12/bernie-sanders-says-americans-back-his-agenda-and-hes-mostly-right/ 




  On the other hand, the "failure", or what I'd prefer to describe as where Obama fell short, was with financial regulations and campaign finance

Let's put it this way - he was a failure from the perspective of those who elected him, but a success from the perspective of those who funded him. 




 Are the same people who supported Ron Paul now supporting Bernie Sanders?  Some are, but because of how diametrically opposed their ideologies are, that can't account for it.  

So why are people who are attracted to reddit also attracted to these political figures.  I suspect the reason is that they are both anti-establishment, and reddit caters to people who are frustrated with the story presented by the mainstream media, which relentlessly supports establishment figures. 



















 Low even by National Review standards. 


































 It's an opportunity for discussion that can make this campaign even stronger. 




 True.  But acknowledging mistakes helps you get it right next time.  And it's also worthwhile for his supporters to have this discussion. 




 I didn't see the Dallas rally. 




 Dude, seriously - I respond to you and you just downvote me? 




  he needs to seize the opportunity to connect with them.

 But he has 

He most emphatically *has not*.

http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/25/us/politics/bernie-sanders-lags-hillary-clinton-in-introducing-himself-to-black-voters.html

Complacency and disrespect for that community amongst Bernie supporters will cost him the nomination.   




 I mean dismissing the protest as just "a group of juvenile and rude bunch".  

Why is the issue closed?  If this affects whether Bernie can win, I think it's foolish to ignore it.   

You should read Chris Savage's post:

 Sitting in the middle of this maelstrom was a fascinating experience. I, like many of the others there, was initially irritated by the protestors. I was there to hear the candidates and was frustrated that they werent being heard. Even a bit angry, in fact. These are your allies, I thought. Why on earth are you attacking them? Why are you disrupting an event where the people there are sympathetic to your cause?

 Frustration. Anger. Being silenced.

 Frustration.

 Anger.

 Silenced.

 Talked over.

 Ignored.

 Every single one of these emotions that ran through my white privileged brain in the first few moments of the protest until I was slapped across the face with what I was being forced to confront. Every single one of these emotions are felt acutely and painfully every single day by racial minority groups in our country. **But, instead of being inconvenienced by not being able to hear a politician speak, they face them in the context of being slaughtered in the streets by the police officers who are tasked to protect them, incarcerated in astonishingly disparate numbers, and blamed for not being able to escape from the prison of poverty that holds far too many of them in bondage.**

Which is covered in CrooksAndLiars:

http://crooksandliars.com/2015/07/about-netroots-nations-town-hall

 If a candidate can't acknowledge his/her weaknesses and change them, you have a weak candidate who will grow weaker over time. (Yes, he incorporated some extra language in his stump speech, and that's good. But he still didn't listen at that time.)

 Whatever I may think of Martin O'Malley (and my personal jury is out on him), his response was certainly better than crossing his arms and leaving angry. He screwed up, acknowledged he screwed up, and then engaged.

 As for Sanders, he had an opportunity and completely missed it. That doesn't make him a bad person or a bad candidate or a bigot or anything else. It makes him a candidate who missed a golden opportunity to close the gap with people who aren't connecting with him or his message, regardless of whether he has been an advocate for the meta-issues which affect them.
 




 If Bernie and his supporters only have that attitude about this issue, he is going to lose.  I don't want to see that happen. 




 Not saying they do - quite the opposite.  Bernie needs to connect with African American voters, and this *is* a burning issue for them.  IMO, he needs to seize the opportunity to connect with them. 









 Agree about those protesters, but this was a moment for him to raise his profile with the  black community beyond these protesters.  He does need to get their support if he hopes to win. 




 Bernie's speech and the interruption is here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHhrvKlZyS4

When Bernie turns to address the issue, he immediately launches into economic issues.  This is *part* of the story, but it doesn't represent the burning pain that the African American community experiences.  Economics is too abstract. He was definitely off key from my perspective (and you can see from my posting history that I'm a huge supporter).  

What Bernie should have said is: "BlackLivesMatter is about the dehumanization of an entire community.  It's a continuation of a racist legacy in this country and we need to recognize that.  We need to recognize it, we need to admit it, we need to apologize for what was done to African Americans and we need to stop it."

He should then talk about why the Civil Rights movement mattered (and delicately mention his role and that he was arrested), and that we need to continue that same struggle for civil rights.  

Bernie needs to put that out there, and connect on a visceral level like he does on the issues in the rest of his problem, before he goes on to addressing his technical solutions.  His technical solutions are pretty good responses, but he needs to position them as addressing the issue of dehumanization.

1. We can reduce Police brutality by introducing community policing
2. An essential component of human dignity is being able to make a living, and that is why we should make a commitment to addressing chronic under employment in minority communities

 




 Totally different situation.  Ron Paul took positions against the Republican base (on military intervention, the drug war and surveillance).  Listen to him being booed at Republican primary debates:

It's the exact opposite for Bernie.  His challenge is to get the message out.
 




 I should do it [like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoethxOp5Kg )? 




 I had to upvote him for the sheer balls-out crazy of it all. 




 Awful.  Sounds like David Axelrod got to that guy.  "Remember to mention how she's relatable because she speaks about her grandkids.  Everyone can relate to that.  Don't forget to mention that you have grandkids too.  Because everyone can relate to that."

Tripe. 




 Thanks.  Strange - I didn't really see anything wrong with what my opponent said either in terms of civility. 









 I'm not sure what is inappropriate in the above comment. 




  So now we're talking about a different issue than the conflict of interest. Unless your point is that this was a bullshit excuse meant to cover the fact that Holder was unwilling to prosecute former clients.

Yes, this is my main point.

 Frankly, I think those are legitimate concerns. 

Ok. That  is the first time you've said that.  IMO, you're part of the problem if you think those are not legitimate concerns.  You gave that impression until now.

 Getting justice against the evil bankers who destroyed our economy, or however you'd like to cast it, 

So I see you're back to sneering at me.  The fact that you seem unconcerned, and a trifle amused by the demand for justice does make me suspicious again.  Crimes which go unpunished are repeated.  But, if you're on the side of the industry or the DOJ, I suppose it's much easier to just characterize critics as wanting some kind of absurd hippie justice.

 would be cold comfort for the people who would suffer if, say, Goldman Sachs was overburdened (let alone forced out of business) by fines and criminal liability. 

Well now, that does sound suspiciously close to Lanny Breuer's reasoning, the Too Big To Prosecute policy.  Should Enron have stayed in business? How about Arthur Anderson?  But I guess you've already said you think it's a concern, so I'll let it go.

 For one thing, setting aside for a moment whether I've watched the video, I think it's appropriate to say you are being unfair, to use your word, to tune me out, seeing as I think I've demonstrated I'm not an idiot

Idiocy wasn't the issue.   Lanny Breuer is probably a smart guy, but he's clearly part of the problem.  (Would you agree?)  I was tuning you out because you gave all indications (until now) that you supported his policies.

  But if you think your comments clearly prove that Holder's DOJ failed, perhaps in bad faith, to prosecute a bunch of individuals that it had a case against, I have no idea where you're getting that.

No, I think they failed in their duties to investigate so that prosecutions were possible.  They soft-gloved these companies.  That by itself is *the* problem.  That  Covington had numerous cases before DOJ during Holder's tenure and was keeping his seat warm creates a picture of impropriety.  Obviously, I'm not claiming to *prove* Holder's motive, but his associations combined with the clear dereliction of duty at his DOJ creates a picture of regulatory capture, and that erodes trust in government.   




 Flawed analysis.  It could be that Obama won because of a swing back from the far right politics of the past 40 years.  The author doesn't account for the fact that Dean and Bradley together never drew the crowds that Sanders is.  And he certainly doesn't account for how a Socialist drew the biggest crowd of any of the contenders in the Red State of Arizona.

 Do you have evidence that Sanders is doing it? 




   and I hope I've made my point that if you treat "Wall Street defense firms" as toxic,

Well, I conceded earlier that isn't really the heart of the issue.  The problem is that Holder's staff *refused to investigate*  and refused to prosecute based  on criteria like "how it would hurt innocent employees and shareholders".  (That is almost a direct quote, if you'd read what I wrote in my comment).

Luckily, you get to dismiss me as "part of the problem" and tune out anything I might possibly say, because obviously I'm just a shill who couldn't possibly contribute anything of value

Don't whine at me that I'm being unfair when you're too lazy not just to watch the video, but even to read the short blog post I referenced that gives a precis of the video, or even, obviously to lazy to read the text in my actual comment.  There's more than enough in there to make my point.   

If you're reflexively defending the revolving door, and refusing to even consider what someone is trying to show you, then yes, you are part of the problem.  




 Exactly.  And that is why nobody listens to progressives.  They'll just go and dutifully vote for whatever corporatist the party runs.  They'll say their "holding their nose", as if that matters.  Ultimately, that's why the Democratic party elites despise their base instead of fearing them.  They are such a pusillanimous bunch. 




 Ron Paul's core positions -- anti-militarism, anti-drug war, anti-surveillance -- were popular on reddit, but hated by actual Republicans.  Sanders' progressive positions are popular with the actual Democratic base.  In fact, majorities of Americans support him when polled on the issues.  http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2015/06/12/bernie-sanders-says-americans-back-his-agenda-and-hes-mostly-right/ 




 I think there's something wrong with you.  I'm done. 




  Matt Taibbi is a joke... He also has no standard of evidence - 

Good "argument".  Are you a joke too?  You've presented no evidence at all.

Failure of oversight is something that's very hard to put someone in jail for because you have no affirmative acts. You certainly can't blame the top executives who don't actually monitor individual transactions. 

http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-02-16/hsbc-bank-secret-origins-laundering-worlds-drug-money


Why did HSBC not terminate its links with the Al Rajhi in 2005? The answer lies in what was then put in place in Afghanistan to generate large amounts of cash. When it comes to opium/ heroin and offshore banks, Britain rules supreme. In 2005, poppy fields in southern Afghanistan began to bloom, and it became evident to the bankers and the geo-politicians of Britain and the US that cash to support the financial centers and the terrorists could be made right there.

http://www.forbes.com/sites/afontevecchia/2012/07/16/hsbc-helped-terrorists-iran-mexican-drug-cartels-launder-money-senate-report-says/

 HSBC actively circumvented rules designed to block transactions involving terrorists, drug lords, and rogue regimes.  In one case, two HSBC affiliates sent nearly 25,000 transactions involving $19.4 billion through their HBUS [HSBCs U.S. affiliate] accounts over seven years without disclosing the transactions links to Iran.

I get it that you're a big fan of banking sector criminals.  The question is why.  Are you an Obama zealot?  Someone who works in banking?  Or are you just a troll? 




 You're arguing for rationality, and let's assume for a minute that regional origin doesn't matter to someone's performance in the role, but that it does matter for elections.  Are you arguing that a politician shouldn't care that a poorly chosen running mate will reduce the chance winning the election?  That seems an absurd and self-defeating attitude.  Logic tends to eliminate candidates who think like that.

Second, it's not clear that regional origin isn't important to the role.  Politicians are connected through networks, and those networks, as for all of us, are likely to be regional.  The fact is that the regional advantage in elections is probably reflective of regional connections and regional connections are important to regional concerns  being considered.  That is "political" thinking. 




 Sounds like you are saying it's a difference in post-processing, not tetrachromacy versus trichromacy? 














 Are you serious?

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/16/foreclosure-fraud-audit-false-claims-act_n_862686.html

 The five separate investigations were conducted by the Department of Housing and Urban Developments inspector general and examined Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Citigroup and Ally Financial, the sources said.

 The audits accuse the five major lenders of violating the False Claims Act, a Civil War-era law crafted as a weapon against firms that swindle the government. The audits were completed between February and March, the sources said. The internal watchdog office at HUD referred its findings to the Department of Justice, which must now decide whether to file charges.

https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2010/2010-59.htm

 The SEC alleges that Goldman Sachs structured and marketed a synthetic collateralized debt obligation (CDO) that hinged on the performance of subprime residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS). Goldman Sachs failed to disclose to investors vital information about the CDO, in particular the role that a major hedge fund played in the portfolio selection process and the fact that the hedge fund had taken a short position against the CDO.

Just the tip of the iceberg.

  You walk into an arena and find 10,000 people looking at you . . .  he said in an interview, trailing off. Then he turned to Michael Briggs, his charmingly beleaguered press aide.

 How many RSVPs do we have now in Phoenix? he asked. 10,000?

 **The swell forced the campaign to move the event twice. The same thing happened in Portland, Maine, where he ended up speaking to more than 7,500. And in Madison, Wis., where he spoke to a crowd about 10,000. And in Denver, where he spoke to about 5,000.** 









 [If online tests for tetrachromacy are nonsense](http://www.snopes.com/politics/medical/tetrachromacy.asp ) why do I see something distinctly different from everyone else?

 It's time to write to the public editor.

public@nytimes.com

Bernie just drew another record crowd in Phoenix, AZ, again the largest of any Presidential candidate.  Why is the NYTimes politics section ignoring  these   events while covering Hillary Clinton at more than twice the rate? 




 Nothing in your quote answers my question.

Why should I answer your question?  The DOJ should figure this out.  They should do their job. But they didn't.

Here's an example.  
http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/outrageous-hsbc-settlement-proves-the-drug-war-is-a-joke-20121213


I don't know why I paste this here.  You won't read it, will you?

Seriously, I think all you've convinced me of is that you are part of the problem.  What is your line of work?  Do you work for the banks, are you a conservative or are you just a die hard Obama fan? 




 Didn't  you ask me this already?

 Elizabeth Warren worked at Cadwalader, one of wall streets' go to law firms. What does that prove?

  I'm curious, although it doesn't matter much to my stance, did he literally have an empty office with his name on it left vacant for years? That'd be kind of funny.
 

[He did](http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/eric-holder-wall-street-double-agent-comes-in-from-the-cold-20150708 ).

  If you don't want to hire people from a firm that could be called a "Wall Street defense firm"

There are lots of top firms that wouldn't be considered top Wall Street defense firms - WSGR, Fenwick, Orrick, etc.  They do financing with these companies, but they certainly are not packed with lawyers who defend them from prosecution.

 I think some oversight is required

 I agree, I just think it occurred.

I don't see how you can look at the evidence in that Frontline piece and come out with the opinion you have.  Honestly, you've only convinced me that you're part of the problem.



 




 I linked you to a video, a blog post summarizing the video, extracted the key bit of that blog post,  copied a statement from a DOJ attorney who explains their too big to prosecute policy... but your response is  "you link me to a 53 minute video".  

It's the job of the DOJ to figure out who to prosecute, not me - and they shirked that duty.  Your dishonest apologetics don't change that.

 




 I answered a very similar comment here:
https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/3dqkxu/elizabeth_warren_sends_hillary_clinton_a_message/ct7wqt0 




 I don't disagree with you.  I think Obama got the policies he wanted. 




 It suggests we should be suspicious of her if she tries to help Wall Street evade accountability for crimes, like Holder did. 














 Trump shows McCain what it's like to be on the receiving end of Republican "logic". 




 Off year elections always favor the opposition party.  So, not sure what left wing saviors have to do with anything.

 ... republicans win

Uh, yeh, I discussed that in my original comment

 




  Suggesting that liberals hold their breath until they get a perfect candidate is exactly what cost the Democrats the House in '10 and the Senate in '14.

Huh?  Off year elections teach us what exactly?  

This makes no sense. 




 Nixon won by the narrowest of margins and Humphrey was a supporter of Johnson's incredibly unpopular policy on Vietnam, so ... meh.

Reagan got elected on the back of stagflation caused by Nixon and cured by Carter.  

Yup, the reaction to Reagan winning was to elect Bill Clinton. Progressives abandoned populism and  got lost in a morass of identity politics that only mattered to children at coastal universities.

And yes, we got Bill Clinton, who is now apologizing for saddling us with NAFTA, giving us Wall Street deregulation, disastrous drug policies, trade policies that drove up drug prices, and giving us mass incarceration which has made us the world's top jailor.

Democrats were wildly popular when they championed progressive populist economic policies.
  




  As for failure to prosecute bankers, there have been plenty of investigations and settlements related to the wrongdoing surrounding the financial crisis.  But if you wanted individuals prosecute, I'd be happy for you to point out to me exactly which people violated which statutes in which ways at which times.

Sounds like your mind is made up, but if you want to learn something, checkout Frontline's coverage of this topic:
http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/untouchables/

[This blog](http://firedoglake.com/2013/01/23/frontline-exposes-dojs-failure-to-prosecute-wall-street/ ) has a good write up that talks about how Frontline reporters were easily able to find witnesses to the crimes that Holder's attorney Lanny Breuer claimed did not exist.  Breuer is the guy who articulated the DOJ's [Too Big to Prosecute Policy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gbcB5BRzXo feature=youtu.be t=19m30s ):

 We are frequently on the receiving end of presentations from defense counsel, CEOs and economists who argue that the collateral consequences of an indictment would be devastating, just devasting for their client.  In my conference room over these past years, I've heard sober predictions that a company or bank might fail if we indict.  That innocent employees could lose their jobs.  That entire industries could be affected and that even global markets will feel the effects.  ... In reaching every chargin decisions we must take into account the effect of an indictment on innocent employees and shareholders..."

If you don't think there's something wrong with that,  sorry, but you are part of the problem.
 




  The revolving door is a reality. It's really, really hard to change that.

That's an absurd, defeatist position.  That's like saying "the floor gets dirty, so why clean it?"  

The fact is, that things have gotten *much worse* over the past 40 years.  http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/28/books/review/this-town-by-mark-leibovich.html:

 in 1974, 3 percent of retiring members of Congress became lobbyists. Now 50 percent of senators and 42 percent of congressmen do. No one goes home anymore.


You make a good case for someone you want to have Holder's resume.  However, you're also ignoring the fact that this guy *did not prosecute people who were his former and future potential clients* while he was AG.  He did not prosecute them for what is agreed to be some of the greatest financial frauds the country has ever seen .  And this went on *for years* with Obama doing nothing about it.  When you have someone with an obvious conflict of interest --- like Holder with his empty corner office at one of Wall Street's favorite defense firms --- I think some oversight is required, or do you disagree with this?  Do you disagree that such a nominee ought to be carefully selected so that they are not in fact a crony of the system they have need to oversee? 




  He got the outcome he want, and employed effective processes to get it. If he'd wanted something different, he might have used different management tactics to get that. The failure was not of management but of values and process.

I completely agree with this.

 All questions of trust rely not just on saying we should trust but what should we trust

Or who we should trust.  I think that was what OP was arguing, and which I was agreeing with.  /u/TheRealRockNRolla was arguing that OP was unfairly criticizing Obama because what he's doing is "just basic management". 




 I love that you assume that insiders refusing to  prosecute their buddies for some of the biggest cases of fraud the world has ever seen is completely ok. 




 Get past the headline and listen to the actual interview.

 Interviewer: "[Your supporters] are afraid that Clinton won't give voice to issues that you care about"

... Warren talks at length about student loan issues.

 Interviewer: "Is Hillary Clinton the right messenger? Could she give a credible voice to give the middle class a fair shake?"

 I think we need to give her a chance to decide if shes going to run and to lay out what she wants to run on, Warren said. **I think thats her opportunity to do that.**

 Warren: "Everyone needs to be talking about, in every race and in every county how we need to be creating a future for the middle class."

That's hardly an endorsement.  She's signaling that Hillary needs to support progressive causes.  Warren is holding a stick to get Hillary to move the debate to the left.  That's smart politics.  

If she just got out and declared against Hillary, she'd just be cast as an opponent and the story would be "Democrats fighting with each other again".  Staying on the sidelines means candidates need to court her.  She shapes the whole conversation.  She can endorse at a later time (the pressure will build for her to do so).  If she times that endorsement correctly, she'll be able to push her preferred nominee to victory.  If she endorses Sanders for example too early, she loses the power of her independent voice.  Endorse now, and everything she says from now on will be considered just another mouthpiece of the Sanders campaign.  As it is, she keeps people guessing, and provides an independent force that drives the conversation to the left. 




 In the short term, a GOP win is terrible.  In the long term, a Wall Street Democrat win is more terrible because it strengthens their position.  If Hillary runs and loses -- because the base is disgusted and refuses to support her -- it strengthens the hand of progressives on the next election cycle.  Progressives are such weak kneed cowards who agree to support the leader no matter what --- as a result, Democratic leaders know they can ignore them.   Republican leaders are scared of their base, and tilt ever further rightward. 




 I haven't gotten the sense she's been rooting for Hillary at all.  She's maintaining distance.  I am disappointed she didn't run.   




 Unlikely .  Adding another New England liberal to the ticket isn't going to help, and Warren is going to be wasted in the VP slot. 




  You delegate to someone you trust to do the job. 

Eric Holder came from one of Wall Street's favorite defense firms.  They actually kept his office empty while he was Attorney General.  Not one Wall Street banker prosecuted under his watch.  He returned recently to his multi-million dollar job.  Should Obama have trusted him?  Does that count as "basic management"?

 




 This is such a clickbait title.   




 I was referring to Rand Paul.

 Another increasingly obvious danger of our current tax code is the empowerment of a rogue agency, the IRS, to examine the most private financial and lifestyle information of every American citizen. We now know that the IRS, through political hacks like former IRS official Lois Lerner, routinely abused its auditing power to build an enemies list and harass anyone who might be adversarial to President Obamas policies. A convoluted tax code enables these corrupt tactics.

What a loon. 




 They don't vote for them "because they're anti-establishment".

They want to hear someone who will explain what's wrong with the system - and who has a plan to fix it.  Both Paul and Sanders aren't shy to critique fundamental problems in our system.  The same people find that refreshing, and trust them.

Even though I'm opposed to Rand Paul and I'm a fan of Sanders, I don't see anything absurd about that. 




 If Hillsry loses because progressives refuse to support her, it'll mean that Democrats will have to cater to the left wing to stand a chance in the next election.  Republicans fear their base because they won't be pushed around.   Democrats despise their base because they are such pathetic spineless weaklings who will always support their party leader.   This is the reason our politics has gone so far right. 




 They're both anti-Establishment candidates.  People know something is deeply wrong and resonate with people who give an explanation and propose radical (in the original sense of getting to the root) changes. 




 Read the flat tax proposal on his site. He sounds like a raving lunatic. 




 I honestly don't see a huge difference between her and Mitt Romney.  She's saying a lot of stuff to placate the left right now, but from a policy perspective, how different is she?
Happy to be convinced that I'm wrong. 




 That's what they're counting on.  The problem with the reliable partisan voter is that the party insiders know they can ignore your opinion since they'll still get your vote. 




 You sound like me most of the time. 




   I would like a break from past administrations, he's still a very polarizing figure (I live in a very conservative state, bring up his name and watch the fireworks display)

I guess I still have a soft spot for him because of his technocratic insights --- global warming and funding the research that gave us the internet.  Those are pretty huge resume points.  Obama and Clinton have no insights.  They are merely politicians.

That said, I totally hear you --- Democrats that don't speak the language of populism are missing the boat, and sadly, Al Gore's personality just doesn't work for a lot of people.  

I'd be happiest with a complete break from the current party infrastructure.  My second choice would be Gore, though.  I don't view Hillary as a legitimate choice at all. 




 How is zero?  Is zero ok for you guys? 




  I don't agree with their assessment that Sanders is a regional candidate. 

Me neither. 




 I'm a big Bernie fan, but also like Gore.  He's a damn sight better than Hillary.  What are your objections to him?   




 Matt Stoler is misreading what the authors say.   There's a good refutation of his piece [here](http://neweconomicperspectives.org/2014/04/oligarchy-yet.html ).  

 And the darkest secret of the ultra-liberal world is that the most palatable alternative to a nominee such as Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren would also be Clinton. 

Thank you, that was truly Idiotic. 




  Or 15% of the voting public have dropped out of the process because they just don't give a shit about politics.

They don't give a shit because they know what political scientists have proven: [the US is an oligarchy](http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-echochambers-27074746 ).   Voting for a candidate funded by Wall Street gives you a candidate who serves the interests of Wall Street.  

 Because those of us who really need our politicians to guard the line effectively know that politics is too important to fuck around with fantasyland.

That is exactly the thinking that those who fund both parties are counting on.  The fantasy is that a corporate candidate is going to do something other than serve those corporate interests.  

http://www.politico.com/story/2014/04/wall-street-republicans-hillary-clinton-2016-106070.html:

 The darkest secret in the big money world of the Republican coastal elite is that **the most palatable alternative to a nominee such as Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas or Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky would be Clinton**, a familiar face on Wall Street following her tenure as a New York senator with relatively moderate views on taxation and financial regulation.

 **If it turns out to be Jeb versus Hillary we would love that and either outcome would be fine,** one top Republican-leaning Wall Street lawyer said over lunch in midtown Manhattan last week. We could live with either one. Jeb versus Joe Biden would also be fine. Its Rand Paul or Ted Cruz versus someone like Elizabeth Warren that would be everybodys worst nightmare. 









  Enthusiasm is an impossible thing to measure beyond anecdotal evidence

Disagree.   Social media metrics - likes, shares, followers - are well recognized measures of enthusiasm.  My company works with Fortune 500 brands, and I can tell you they are *all* concerned with these metrics.  They would drool to have a tiny sliver of what Sanders gets for free.  I've looked at the numbers, and he's killing on this front. 

 Ultimately, however, the amount of votes that will be reached and turned by that base is just not big enough to warrant a discussion in a primary like this

You seem certain, but supply no evidence to support that claim.  How would you quantitate that?  How big is that audience?  Why did Sanders rise from 2% to 15% in a couple of months, and with no funding?   Did your thinking account for that?  Why should I think that your current feelings have any more predictive power?

 Social Advertising may happen, but that risks over-enthusiasm (See many in Tea Party) and a resultant content exhaustion from other consumers.

This is just opinion masquerading as fact. One could easily say "advertising on traditional media risks over exhaustion and mistrust of consumers, who increasingly see paid media as untrustworthy.  Hillary's billions may backfire on her".  See?  Anyone can spout opinions.

 




  but the issue is that most of these people aren't going to have the experience or training at the level of the Field Organizers that Hillary will have, which is where her fundamental advantages lies. 

Agree - I think that's a big challenge for his campaign.  I just came across this  New Republic article asking the same question.  Someone  who's involved with the campaign says that there's a big launch planned for end of July.  It will be interesting to see how they manage:
https://np.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/3d9iqo/bernie_sanderss_grassroots_army_is_passionate_but/ct341xe

 There's already over a thousand events across the country scheduled, with more added daily. These volunteer coordinators will CC the regional coordinators on things. In a way, there is a top-down oversight they're working on, but it still depends heavily on volunteers. 

Sounds like lots of stuff happening, but "in a way/depends heavily on volunteers" suggests there's not much coordination (yet). 




  Crowds don't really mean anything in a Presidential election.

Crowds are an indicator of enthusiasm, and you later say that enthusiasm is important, so you seem to be contradicting yourself.

 People who go to a rally aren't going to do anything but vote for the candidate, 

For starters, they talk about the candidate on social media.  Social media is free and as advertising it's more effective.  To quantitate this, consider that even *paid* influencer advertising is estimated to be [4-10x more likely to cause a conversion than traditional media](http://branderati.com/the-age-of-advocacy-and-influence-26-stats-marketers-should-know/ ).  Sanders is winning social media hands down over *every* other candidate.  See [this piece in NYT](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/19/us/politics/bernie-sanders-wants-to-be-president-but-hes-already-facebook-royalty.html ).  

So Sanders is the hands down winner at the most effective form of advertising which also happens to be completely free.  


 Hillary's phone-banking, GOTV, and door-knocking will be an organized and efficient machine that Sanders cannot hope to touch, realistically.

Being able to pay workers is helpful. But what do you make of the 175K (as of May 4th) Sanders volunteers?  Obviously, not all will activate, but it goes to the point that enthusiasm means Sanders can do much more with much less.

It's not clear that Sanders won't be organized --- he's getting top talent joining his campaign.  Organizers like the head of the Communication Workers Union just recently joined for example.  But agree, he doesn't have the well oiled machine that Clinton has and her advantages in the mainstream media are matched by his deficits there.  Ad to this that Clinton and her supporters in key positions in the Democratic Party (e.g., Wasserman Schultz) are doing their best to tip the scales in her favor, and we can see that Sanders has his work cut out for him.

Still, it's far from a certainty where it will go.  The new media landscape and massive voter frustration are new variables. 




 This looks like viral marketing, and I was extremely skeptical, but the Amazon reviews seem to back this up.

Can an opthamologist explain how this works?  It seems strange that someone who is missing one type of cone can see new colors because of a lens. 




  Bernie Sanders most definitely knows that he will not

Is there any useful information in that statement?

Prediction markets currently give him 11%.

  The country is split basically 50/50 politically and the battle is for the increasingly small middle. 

"The battle for the middle"  is a Sunday talk show trope, which like many things they say, is not backed by actual evidence.  Elections are more likely won or lost based on the enthusiasm gap.  Here's [an analysis from Nate Silver](http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/04/enthusiasm-gap-was-largest-in-presidential-swing-states/ ) which pretty convincingly demonstrates this.

I.e., Battle for the Middle is nonsense.  Voter enthusiasm is key.  

(Who has been drawing the largest crowds of any Presidential candidate?)

  If you are the kind of person who would vote for Bernie Sanders, you are not the kind of person who is going to vote for Bush, Paul, or Rubio. 

Not clear - Bernie  appeals to voters who are frustrated by bad government.  Republicans win low information voters with a populist message about big government elitists.  Corporate Democrats play right into that messaging.

Sanders' thesis is that there are a lot of people frustrated with government who would be open to a populist message from the left.  That hasn't happened in over 50 years, but the last time it did, Democrats won huge majorities and were competitive in all 50 states.   




 What are you basing that on?  

General election voter participation rate has been trending downwards since the 80s.  In 88 it was above 75%, now it is just breaking 60%.  At the same time we have the Congressional approval rating in history.  

So 15% of the voting public have dropped out of the process because they don't believe their elected officials actually represent them (an idea [verified] (http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-echochambers-27074746 )  by political scientists).

That's a huge number of new voters that  might be reached by the right campaign.

 




 I literally face palmed when I saw Abrams cast Cumberbatch as Khan.  As [this post](http://bitchmagazine.org/post/the-race-of-khan-in-the-new-star-trek-into-darkness-movie-0 ) puts it, continuing "a tradition where complicated, sympathetic villains are white guys, whereas garden variety angry bad-guys are more likely to be people of color."

Pure gold. 














 Toronto is like the Boston of the North. 




 Webb seems to be trying out for the position, staking out a position to the far right, defending the Confederate flag and saying that "Youre right, the party has moved way far to the left.

 Search for Bernie Sanders' volunteer page.  (/r/politics blocked the comment where I posted a direct link to it).

 I didn't know what to expect.  That absolutely floored me. 




 Is that a leonberger pup? 




 The only reason you provide for the data being invalid are the source --- how is that not an ad hominem attack 




 But he is also unknown amongst man of those voters.  Remember -- he was at 2% when the primaries started.   As voters start to understand what he's about, they will flock to him. 









 His only arguments are [ad hominem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem ) attacks.  Ignore. 




 Rather than ad hominem attacks, how about some data?

Polls from other sources come to a similar conclusion.  For example, this recent WaPo piece: ["Bernie Sanders says Americans back his agenda  and hes mostly right"](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2015/06/12/bernie-sanders-says-americans-back-his-agenda-and-hes-mostly-right/ ) 




 A few reasons:

1. Opposition tends to win in off-year elections
2. Obama's lost enthusiasm by tacking right immediately after getting elected
3. Seats in play were primarily Democratic, that year, if I remember correctly
3. Gerrymandering meant that Democrats had to win more votes to get elected 




 LOL. 




 Hey guys --- we found one !!! 




 Prediction markets give Sanders a [10% chance](http://www.predictwise.com/politics/2016demnomination ). 




 Very common to see that in developing countries. 



















 Sample size required for 5% error and 95% confidence is only 126.  I.e., this study is 44 times higher than that.

The margin of error with a sample size of 5K is .79%.  The confidence level is 99.99999999999%

 Statists is actually a hugely misleading field.

Uh huh.... what exactly are your qualifications?
 














 Or brain freeze. 









 TIL the field of statistics is false because a guy on reddit said so. 




 Uh... [sampling](http://www.surveysystem.com/sscalc.htm )? 




 ... and angry 




 The funny thing is that if they actually read what I wrote above it concludes that laws cannot fix the problem.   



















 Wait - why am I getting downvoted for that? 




 Rand Paul. 




  My neighbor bought those 9 mm I mentioned earlier, and one night a pickup truck parked across the road and blared music at 2 in the morning. He went out there and opened fire.

Wow.  That sounds like exactly the kind of person they're describing in the study. 




  That's pretty much the problem. Most of this is not angry people running out, buying a gun, and shooting, nor is it mentally handicapped people, so it can't be stopped.

Yet other countries don't have the problem.  Why? 




 So given that they don't have a criminal record and that they may just be angry impulsive people *in general*, is there actually any way to keep the guns out of their hands?

I.e., with criminals you can mandate criminal background checks.  If it were people with diagnosable mental disorders, it might be possible to regulate based on mental health history (though, obviously, lots of issues in how to handle that).  If it were people who got angry suddenly and committed acts soon thereafter, you could have a waiting period.  

BUT... if it's a population of people who are constantly angry and impulsive, neither criminal background check nor psychiatric check nor waiting period is going to fix the problem.

(On a side note, I think the gun nuts have found this thread, and are downvoting facts, which you are guilty of providing.   Have an upvote from me.)

 




 Oh, right, yeh, I guess it's not a problem at all that angry, impulsive people tend to buy lots of guns. 




 I think he's referring to this: ["Clinton's campaign sets $2B fundraising target"](http://www.politico.com/story/2015/05/hillary-clinton-fundraising-goal-2-billion-118183.html ) 









 What is the right size sample? 














 Agree - he seems to be also have the regular Republican voter in mind.  He has talked about the [50 state strategy](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/sanders-dems-insane-to-ignore-red-states-wants-primary-debates-with-republicans/article/2567646 ) (that Howard Dean initially championed).  I think he has the message to do it.

 




 He actually hits the Republican Party pretty hard.  Have you heard his push back on "Family Values"?

**EDIT**: "Republican" = "Republican Party" 









 I keep seeing anecdotes - here on Reddit, and in the news (see below) - that otherwise stalwart Republican voters like what they hear from Bernie.  Ideologues are still going to hate him... but it may be that a lot of casual conservatives care more about authenticity.  Bernie gives an unfiltered explanation of why America isn't working for them and a clear plan to change that. 

So is there a population of Republicans who'd switch if they heard Bernie's message?  I'd love to see numbers on this.

http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/06/23/1395700/-Republicans-for-Bernie-Sanders#

Team Sanders seems to understand this already, given the recent ad.

 




 Stellar letters.  It would be good to ask the ombudsman to take a position on the coverage of Sanders.

**EDIT**: I meant Public Editor, not ombudsman. 




 I keep seeing anecdotes like this.  I'd love to see some numbers on this.

The reason Democrats lost so many people in the middle of the country is that we've run inauthentic Washington liberals. To the extent that Obama has tacked right and failed to be a progressive, his numbers have fallen.  Washington insiders argue that the country is center right, but I think the opposite is true --- on issue after issue, Americans are much further left than our actual politics.  The problem is that neither party gives them what they want.  Democrats give a watered down version that people don't know whether to trust.  While Republicans mislead them with lies that explain why they are held back economically (Big Government! Washington Liberals!)

Regular folks want straight talkers who don't hold back, and who give them explanations of why America isn't working for them, not carefully parsed talking points.  GWB gave them a manufactured authenticity.  Sanders, on the other hand, is genuinely authentic, and I think the public is hungry for it. 









 Which hasn't got much circulation.

 How is this an editorialized title?  

The only thing I added was the date to signal that this is in fact an old post. 




 Mismanagement is mismanagement.  It doesn't matter how you get there.

Bible Belt doesn't have its own currency, so the only way it can survive is by a massive injection of Federal dollars.

Greece can't debase its currency (making its exports cheaper) AND it isn't getting funds from the wealthier parts of the currency union.

Either you have a currency union and there are cash transfers to keep the failures afloat (like here in the US), or you have separate states with separate currencies.   




  Instead of childishly keep asking for other countries to be the responsible ones, to keep supporting a child that refuses to take responsibility for it's actions and choices.

You mean like we do here in the US, where wealthy liberal states support poor conservative ones?
