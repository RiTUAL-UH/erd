 I have the Hogwarts crest, Always, and the dark mark  




 I have tattoos. Like three so far. And more on the way. That's how I rep the wizarding world!!!  




 Maybe post a link to it? I can't find it.... 




 Why is r/Hogwarts private?  




 I was just wondering if there was a sub reddit for Hogwarts.  




 In the audiobooks, it's pronounced Voldemore. In the paper books and movies, it's Voldemort. Someone help?  




 Not true, they die in the reverse order.  




 I actually started at 24mgs because that's the amount a real cigarette has. It's actually better than the patch in my opinion because you still have the hand to mouth, which is what did me in so many times. The hand to mouth habit is the true killer in smoking, and vaping really helps with that. The patch won't satisfy that feeling, so you're more likely to go back to smoking.  




 One nice thing about vaping is that you can progress down!! I'm currently on zero nicotine, but I like the flavour I use. So I continue to do it anyways.  




 So I don't know how to post how long it's been for me, but it's been over a year now. The e cigarette is a joke. I tried one for a while, and I fucking hated it. What you want to do is go to the nearest vape shop. Look it up, google can tell you where it is. Go in and tell them your story. They will help you out. I have a regular shop I go to, and they are some of the nicest, most supportive people I've met (besides my girlfriend of course.) 

Keep it up!! You can do it!! 
























 I'm willing to bet JKR realised that her faithful fandom would bring this point up, though. Hence the reason that Harry became a horcrux.  




 I feel as though the Room of Requirement was a perfect place. In plain sight, however, for close to 50 years he was the only one who knew what it looked like. Incredibly smart in my opinion.  




 He used the blood of a foe (that for being Harry Potter, his 7th and final Horcrux) 




 Bacon, coffee, clean hair, and beer 




 In my opinion, reboots are inevitable. It's gonna happen. My only hope is that the reboots do these movies justice. Otherwise, I don't wanna live on this planet anymore.  




 I'm with you. Never read a single comic. But I love the movies. Like no other.  




 You and I not only have something in common, then, but would also be excellent friends.  




 Cloak and wand. 

The only people I know who have passed, are at peace. I don't want to disturb their peace. They are waiting for me on the other side of the Veil. 

The cloak and wand, they just seem like the logical choices.  




 Ah yes. Some of those plot lines were missing. However, I still believe it was the best. The final movie haas too many disappointments for me.  




 What issue did you have with the third movie? I thought it was the best done of the series.  
























 I don't think I ever noticed that!! You, dear potter head, are awesome!!!  




 And I would be honoured to be among those numbers alongside good brothers and sisters  




 Oh yes. It's real to us.  




 So I'm rereading the fourth book for the 400th time. And I'm at the graveyard with Harry. And I noticed something. One of the trees mentioned is a yew tree. And voldemorts' wand is made of yew. Thought it was an interesting little tidbit!!  




 Welcome home, friend!! 




 I like this idea. This one seems like the most likely to me.  




 Is anyone else curious as to how a howler doesn't explode en route? Like, what kind of magic is used for that? What if a howler had to be sent to somewhere like Bulgaria from England? Just thought of this!!  




 Not all the trials are present before getting to the sorcerers stone.  




 And this is what I was trying to point out :) thank you.  




 Think about it. JKR says that the process for making a Horcrux is difficult and time consuming. If we hold this to truth, then how was Harry "accidental"? Voldie would've had to have had this planned out, correct? Share your thoughts!! 
























 I'm 21, and I've rather recently discovered that I have early onset arthritis in my right knee. So I definitely know your struggle. It's not easy. I usually just use either a compression brace, or a full on DonJoy knee brace, depending on the pain level. However, there are many days I can go without one. But on bad days, I can't really seem to cope with it. I get really irritable, and my closest friends and family can't really seem to be near me. The only one who has been able to stay by me is the wonderful woman I'm dating. She always seems to know what to say or do. My biggest recommendation is to find a good brace, and an even better support system. Because otherwise, at least in my opinion, the pain may just over take you. 

Also, lots of ibuprofen. Always a big help when it comes to inflammation, or any sort of pain. Hope this helped you!! You are not alone!!  




 ......Can someone please tell me what video this is? I've actually never heard of it..... 




 That's not pathetic at all. It's never easy to lose someone you're close with, and when something like this happens, it's completely natural to want to make amends. Don't think that it's pathetic that you want to talk to your grandfather again, and tell him how you feel. 




 As far as the Miranda Rights being read is concerned, they only need to read them to you before booking you. So they have from the time they arrest you to the time they book you to read them to you. Otherwise, anything that you have said before that won't count against you. 

After you've been read them, then the only thing you should say is "I want to speak to a lawyer."  




 First off, congratulations on being clean!! My father ended up kicking meth, so it's always amazing for me to hear of others that are also doing well!! I love hearing about how others can kick those kinds of habits to better themselves!! 

Second, it sounds like your parents don't really deserve your time. (Now that is just my opinion, but I've also had to cut toxic people from my life, so I know the struggle.) It sucks to write/hear, but sometimes that's what's necessary to building a happy and healthy life.

I'm honestly curious, you said the help of NA, and I know that one. Who is the "Bill W" mentioned in this post? 




 This. This is the reason Ron would never join Voldy. He's way more afraid Mrs. Weasley than of the Dark Lord.  




 That makes total sense. Her character feels to forced. And (at least, this is how it feels to me) she is always going on about how she's a lesbian. It almost feels as though the writers just want people to know that, rather than focus on making her a hunter. That's just my two cents though. 




 I never really thought of Charlie in that sense. In fact, I never really think of any of the characters in that sense unless it's a situation like when Sam or Dean has a female guest over. Other than that, to me, they are all just people who hunt the things that go bump in the night. So I guess I'm saying that I personally have never had a problem with Charlie, however, I can definitely see where you would have a problem with her. And kudos to you for pointing this out :) 




 Everyone keeps saying Tony. For some reason, I just can't see it being him. I can, of course, see it being Fury. I, too, feel it needs to be him.  




 That's the best thing about this fandom. Everyone helps everyone else.  
























 My 10 is probably about a 7-7.5 for most of you. For others, it would probably be considered higher, and for the rest, it could even be a 3. Pain tolerance is dependent on the person, and I know for me, a 10 is when I can't walk (Early-Onset Arthritis.) My knee is in so much pain, I have to judge just how badly I need to use the restroom before getting out of bed just to walk across the hall. My SO has on more than one occasion had to go to the kitchen for me just to get me some water because I'm at a 6 for me. A 6 cripples me, a 10 just means that I can't move at all, for fear of passing out. 

Unfortunately for me, if I'm having a day when I reach a 10 and still need to go to work, I have to push through due to the fact that my job requires I be on my feet all day. Those are the worst days for me, because no one at my office knows that I have arthritis in my knee.  




 If there's a chance the treatment won't work, I think you should try the surgery. No one likes to be in pain all the time, and I for one would do anything I could to help the recovery process. I'm willing to put down good money that your insurance would cover this kind of surgery. I say go for it, OP!! 




 So that "foreign" language looks and sounds Enochian to me. That would be the language of the Angels for anyone who didn't already know. Those are very dangerous spells, OP. Be careful dealing with those. 




 Yeah, I pressed it. Couldn't stop myself. AMA!! 




 I currently have a Turtleship Brass, but it's getting old, been dropped one too many times, and it's just overall time for a new mod. However, I'm broke as all hell. Can someone suggest a good mod that's fairly inexpensive? I'd like to spend $150 or less if possible. Thanks guys!! 




 I honestly can't read the books or listen to the audiobooks without feeling like this. This universe is just expansive and including that I always feel as though I'm a part of it, and it's so well written that I just get sucked in and have a really difficult time leaving. That being said, NO REGRETS!!!! 




 All demonic entities have a dark side. That's why they are considered demons. That being said, not all are pure evil. In fact, some try to do good, and bad things happen as a result. Some try to help, and things just go awry. Try to focus yourself on what he wants, OP, and remember this. Maybe he's trying to help. Maybe he's trying to rectify his sins of past. 

Always acknowledge him when he wants it. It's when they get angry that the bad shit really goes down. That's when they strike that hardest, and the strongest. 

They are always there watching, waiting for the right moment.  




 Can you ask this "site" why the shadow people only went for those with souls? I feel as though those without souls (such as yourself and myself) would be of more use. We could cause destruction, mayhem, and chaos.  




 I also work at Starbucks, and I must say, being burned by coffee is usually the least of my worries in a day. I usually burn myself a good three or four times a day. My hands and wrists are so used to it, I just don't feel it anymore xD 

ANYWAYS!!!! I digress. Honestly, I feel for you :/ It's really shitty when you burn yourself at work. Did you supervisor at least let you go to the back to take care of it? 




 Simmons. The chick that plays her is fine, and the accent, oh god the accent...... 
























 Can anyone tell me where these woods are? I want to do some research on the Whistlers. To me, it seems as though they are just people that are driven to this primal place in order to survive these woods, and then are drawn into a war they had no idea was taking place with this creature out there. This creature is the true problem, the reason that people may die. However, if the Whistlers can get to the people first, then the people would be safe.  




 Keep us updated as to whether or not it's Tommy!! And stay safe, OP. Seriously, the supernatural is not something you want after you. Ever.  




 I just won't tell anyone about her :D Then she can't kill me, can she? 




 So I'm curious, and a little lost, OP. What does cracking your knuckles do?  




 First, I want to thank everyone here for your support :) you're a great group of people, and I'm glad I have this sub. 

Second, this isn't a work related injury. It's just pain brought on by my arthritis. I appreciate everyone's concern, but this isn't the first time this has happened. I'll get through it, I was just hoping someone would have some advice on pain management :/ 




 So some background first. I work in an office as a facilities assistant. That basically means I'm the Break Room Fairy. I stock up the break rooms in the morning, check/set up the conference rooms, deliver mail, that sort of thing. This typically means I'm on my feet all day. As someone with early onset arthritis in one of my knees, this can become quite painful. 

However, today was different. I was delivering some packages, and went to turn around on my heel, a motion I have made thousands of times around here. The only difference? I somehow twisted wrong, and my knee explodes into an instant ten on the pain scale. I couldn't move, nor could I call out. My coworkers don't know I have these knee problems, and letting them know would be bad, as it's only my fifth week on this job. After a few minutes, the pain subsided to an easy seven, but has remained there since. This happened about an hour ago, and every time I go to turn, instant ten again. I just don't know what to do, I'm hoping someone can help? Maybe a couple of pointers, other than not turning on that leg? As I work in an office, it's incredibly difficult to not move and turn this way and that....

Sorry for the long post!! 




 I haven't started season ten yet!! Don't tell me anything!! I tried to start it on Hulu, but Hulu is really dumb and only streams the 5 most recent episodes. So I haven't started it yet. 




 Do you know what House she belongs to? Because that could be a very big gift op there. 




 Are you Sirius with that? That was a very Harry joke. 




 Honestly, I want them to go back to the roots of the show. Start bringing in new monsters like the first season. Or even repeat a few monsters we've seen before. We've seen a few episodes with Shapeshifters, and Vamps of course. But only one werewolf, one woman in white, one Wendigo, etc. However, over 100 demon episodes, plenty with angels, and the like. Honestly, I want some new damn material.  
























 A) I'm pretty sure it's a continuation, and B) why was it removed? It was a good story. 




 I just went to my GP 




 .......The fuck? 




 I don't have the books in front of me right now, so I could be remembering wrong, but isn't it stated somewhere that McGonagall told all the teachers about Hermione's time turner? If so, Lupin could've seen both, and just realised what was really happening.  




 I just want to know, why did the turtle have to die? 




 He sounds like a good man. Music is one of the most important things to hold onto. I wish you the best.  




 I'm sorry for your loss. What was your father like?  




 I would see myself living with my girlfriend, having become my wife, pregnant with our child. We live somewhere far away from here, whether it's Portland (we've both expressed great interest in living there) or abroad. Only seeing our somewhat messed up families on the big holidays. Surrounded by friends close enough to consider them family. 

Money and status mean incredibly close to nothing to me. Those things buy comfort, not happiness. So the house we live in would be big enough to support the family, but it wouldn't be overly extravagant.  




 So i actually figured it out.... but i know someone on here would've greed, for which i am grateful..... 




 So i have no idea how to create a post on my reddit to go app.... i made this post on chrome, btw... can someone please tell me how to create a post on my app? 
























 Soooo.... Is anyone else as worried as I am that there hasn't been an update? 




 Your "boyfriend" seems like a total fuckwad. 

You definitely deserve to feel special on your birthday, and your 21st no less. Honestly, everyone here is right. You should definitely get yourself done up, and just go treat yourself to some breakfast, or brunch. If you can, definitely do a movie as well. Always a good help, and there are great movies out right now. 

We may be internet strangers, but you can always turn to us to be there for you. 

And your kitty really does love you. They can sense emotional stresses, and will help you through this. You're awesome, OP!! And happy birthday :) stay strong.  




 .....isn't it the three eyed crow? 




 It's count of how many have found this place and died. It's keeping track of how many people have perished in the chamber with no air. Soon it will read 12,109. 




 Soooo..... It sounds like you should move. Like now. Maybe move in with Anna somewhere new? That seems to be the only thing that would help. Unless they follow you.... As for any new owners to the house, well they can deal with the Ghosts or Demons, or whatever they are. Just be sure you're careful when moving.  




 Soooo...... My name is Will...... Shit.... Please don't come after my family.....

On a side note, I love that all your stories seem to have some sort of way for you to resolve them. You clearly care about all of your friends and family, and I respect that a great deal.  




 Is anyone else worried that we haven't heard from either OP or /u/solotopvladimir in a while? Because I'm starting to get really worried about them..... 




 As far as FU's go, this one is pretty mild. I agree with some of the others here, just make this your NoSleep profile, and make a different one for your personal account. That's what I did, I have a NoSleep profile, and this one. It always works out great. 




 .....did you castrate him at the time?  




 I actually kinda expected them to be awake and say she owed them money for staying in their BnB.... Like maybe she didn't realise what they said as she was so drunk... But hey, good things are good!!  
























 It makes too much sense that this world we inhabit is not meant for human souls. There is too much pain and suffering here. 

I feel for you OP. I'm sorry you had to endure that, and I hope Tamara either forgets her hatred, or forgives you with time. 




 Will second. Join in, and just have some fun ;) 




 .....and now my eyes are dry.... 




 Will second this statement...... What the actual fuck did I just read? 




 Salt the living hell out of that thing, then burn in with sage, then take the ashes, and mix them with salt. Then burn that shit too. Clowns are the creepiest things known to mankind. 




 But they can migrate from the couch.... Makes it sound as though they could be anywhere..... 




 If you can, try to get a look at it. Try and describe it for us so we may help you better. Other than that, though, if sleeping under the bed has worked so far, why fix what ain't broke? 




 You should find out what you can. If the police are there, then obviously the problem isn't gone. You need to know how to defend yourself against this thing.  




 .....How did the lady know that he had to sit down and close his eyes? How did she know he was standing? Who is she? What does she know? Who was the entity outside the window? And why are there more police patrolling the area now? 




 "But I love a good mystery too, my darling Lucy."

The sentence that chilled me to my core. Definitely a well written account of what is happening to you OP.

I will say, however, that if it is Lucy, she's a much better actress than you may have every thought possible. Just watch your step. Always remember, keep your friends close, but your enemies closer. See if you can get the sick bastard to bring up another box. The part that gets me is the fact that there were Lucy's hairs with the evidence.

Tread carefully, OP. 
























 When I read about the pictures, all I could think about was how some victims feel like they aren't good enough, or that they can't face their families or loved ones. But your explanation makes more sense now. 




 So tonight is the new moon. They will be going down the rabbit hole tonight. Keep them in your thoughts, everyone. 

Isiah, Holly, and Caleb, we are rooting for all of you. 




 Soooo......... Do we get another update? At least one explaining why you're immune to the mold and to Hadwell? 




 This is the only one that gives me pause. The use of the radio. Only because in GoF, Hermione explains that there is too much magic around Hogwarts, and it would interfere with any sort of electronics. I'm pretty sure that the cameras they are using are older models that don't have any electronic parts. As to why they haven't incorporated any other Muggle tech into their world is because their homes would be too infused with magic (as similar to Hogwarts) and they would fry the electronics. The Hogwarts Express is a steam engine, one of the first trains invented, and therefore has no electronics. 

Hope this helps!! 




 They could've used the spell that either Crouch or Amos used in the beginning of the book as well. It would've shown them the last few spells Harry used, and then they would've seen that he didn't kill Cedric. 

Honestly, I think that even the Ministry couldn't find a way to justify Harry being the killer. They knew that if they did that, the rest of the Wizarding World would've known Harry was telling the truth, because he's the Boy Who Lived. 




 She's my girlfriend and she's a small part of the problem. I need to talk to her about it, and I will. I just don't want to .

As to why I don't want to exist, I couldn't tell you. Again, I'm not suicidal, I just don't want to be anymore. Like I just want to be empty. I already feel like a living shell of who I once was, and I wish I could say it was the first time. 

I laid in bed last night, and all I could think about was how I wanted to be anywhere but there. But then I thought about staying at my girlfriends place, and that thought was also unappealing (that one being a first, I've never not wanted to stay with her). So I started thinking about other places I could go to crash, and nothing sounded good. So I opted to stay in my own bed, but it just felt wrong. It didn't feel like the bed I've slept in for the past few years. 




 I wish people would give me random HP quizzes.... I have an arm completely devoted to HP (tattoo sleeve) and no one ever asks me anything. 




 I just feel like I don't want to exist. Not suicidal, just like I don't want to be anymore. I want to be numb, to not feel anything. But I also don't want that, because then that would still be existing. I don't know what to do or think, or feel. I need a lot of help right now, and I feel like I can't turn to the one person I used to be able to turn to, because I don't feel like she would actually care. But I know she would, and that she would do anything to help me. I just can't bring myself to talk to her about it. 




 So I feel like there was an update between this and Holly's 40 Nights in Hell. Can anyone link it for me? I feel like she gave us an update wherein she details when Jude told her about the portal. I could be wrong, and if I am, please let me know. I'm going back and rereading everything to see if I can pick up clues to help them. 




 I would actually suggest rock salt versus sea salt. Much more pure, much stronger at keeping evil at bay. 




 Hope you and Holly are still safe.... I know we are all worried about you. 




 Yeah. He was always really creeped out by them. We found like this dead animal down there back when we were kids, and he swore up and down it was a human body and made us leave. Thats why he would never go with me again.
Thats.comforting. Wow.
Relax. It was just a dog or something that fell in and got stuck. I felt bad for it but it definitely wasnt a dead person.

Guys, Caleb knew what this was.... This is why he freaked out so much. He knew way more than he initially let on. 

Caleb, if you're reading this, sorry to call you out like that.  




 Guys, all I have to say right now is be careful. I know the new moon is coming on soon, and I don't want you guys to end up hurt or dead. 

Also, Holly, be careful the next time you meet up with Lucifer. He seems somewhat trustworthy from what I've read so far, and all the lore I've ever read about him seems to state that he doesn't lie all that much. He does on occasion, and I do know that most true Demons don't lie. They may leave some stuff out of their deals with humans, but they don't lie. Angels lie. A lot. Just tread with caution. 




 I had to swipe on either the top or bottom of my computer to do so, but I have a touchscreen. I don't know what you have, but maybe try googling it?  




 Everyone knows that reddit reaches across the veil to the other world just as easily as I'm typing this out. We've all seen the ghost stories :) 




 Isaiah, when can we get an update from your time gone? I know I'm curious as to what happened to you for sure.  




 How long ago was this? 




 What the fuck is in your car with you?! Update us quickly, OP!!
