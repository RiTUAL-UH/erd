 Glad they took him out second half.  




 Ya I did seem he slap his legs or just get pissed if when someone made a small mistake. For example someone passed the ball to the other team he got pissed and just walked away instead of getting the ball back. 









 He didn't do so well tonight he seemed lazy and didn't try to run the ball even tho the ball opportunity wasn't gonna happen he still needs to make the runs. It seems like he doesn't believe in his team.  




 I did, I was great game to watch my first soccer game too!! 




 I am in millersville md if your going to the game we can meet there maybe?  




 Are you serious?! 




 I just wanna watch the game for tonight you can change the password after tonight willing to provide identity info.

 What if we take what our body produces and enhances it? 














 What do they say? 




 Even then the pace of the European game is much faster then the American basketball  









 Sims and fifa 




 Time won't be wasted tho since they have extra balls that they throw in regardless. 




 Not really trying to steal one just let the stadium allowing to take one 




 A good ball once in a whole never hurts 




 And how much do they pay for those balls I doubt it's 200 dollars and if so is it not about the fans. The whole point of the game is let the fans enjoy themselves and have an attachment to the game and the players. What's not better then a free ball from their favorite footballer to keep that fan hood? 




 I say about 3 -4 balls go into stands every game to the billions of dollars fifa gets yearly.  




 Usually fans throw the ball back on the pitch and then there's two balls on the field which makes a delay either way time will be wasted. I believe we should be allowed to keep a ball for memory of the game like other sports do it's kinda unfair that we have to return and only have a cup with a team name to show for it. 




 Wasting time? There's ball boys that have extra balls. 




 That's what I was thinking  




 To hell with rules if a famous footballer kicks a 200 dollar ball to my face hell ya imma keep it  














 If it's approved when will it finish? 




 I will be excited when I piss in their toilet so I know it's real

 That's exactly why  









 Did he actually say that? 



















 I'm American and go to a public high school with very little blacks, they're racist here and I can't go a day without hearing a negative tone towards my skin color and I live on the suburbs. I used to go to a very big high school with many blacks and they are just as racist because I'm darker than most.  




 I'm 100% sure it will, but there's no proof, yet.

 Thinking about saving up one day and buying it, how much are they?  




 They refuse to switch mine out for security reason which I understand  




 They have hung up on me twice so far and it's been 3 hours I wouldn't be so mad if it wasn't a waste of 100 dollars 




 I bought a 100 dollar psn code from 7-11 and the code didn't work so I went to get a new one and the refused because of security reason and so I'm on the phone with sony for about a good 3 hours and they refuse to refund me because thy can't validate my code.  














 My mom is trying to figure what the name of this movie is and she can't get. It's about twins one not and one girl and the boy is evil and the daughter is apparently an angel. She says there's a cliff hanger at the end and that there is a second movie out or coming out finishing the story.

 A simple Atwood's machine is shown in the diagram above. It is composed of a frictionless lightweight pulley with two cubes connected by a light string. If cube A has a mass of 4.0 kg and cube B has a mass of 6.0 kg, the system will move such that cube B accelerates downwards. What would be the tension in the two parts of the string between the pulley and the cubes?

 Racism is racism, we should not tolerate it at any level. If we do we are teaching our kids racism is ok. 









 Regardless it doesn't matter if he was black it didn't add to the story he literally said it for no reason.  




 I've had a black admin in all my schools with less than 25% black population.  




 How many schools have you attended for your assumption that blacks aren't principles?  









 I just asked why mention he's black I did not once mention I was black. I'm saying don't ignore the problem just because you don't see it doesn't mean it doesn't happen.  




 Because it doesn't matter 




 If he was white he probably wouldn't have said anything. It's small things that create racism. Sure mentioning he's black was harmless and maybe he was just being descriptive but he probably just mentioned he was black because it's not a generally a black profession and it's isolating blacks as whole. Who cares if he was black or white there was literally no point in saying it. If he cares that much about how it looked he could watch the gif himself. 




 Why did you mention that he was black? EDIT: instead of down voting how about adding to the conversation instead of down voting.  




 My school has a iPhone group chat for every sport except football that I know of 




 They probably can afford to buy them but just so you know I only know about 5-6 people who still actively uses Facebook out of about 100-140

 I'm considered a jack of all trades, I pretty much try ecerything but don't fully commit. But the one thing I am set on is joining the navy. I want to be a senator one day, so I thought of becoming an ambassador but that doesn't seem likely.
