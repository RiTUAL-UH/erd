 Ok thanks so much. How long have you been riding for? 




 i live in North Vancouver. i would do my riding here http://www.bikepirate.com/dh-trails/mount-fromme/. i have ridden here before with my norco (bigfoot? haha i forget exactly which model) but that bike got stolen. 




 Also, i would use the bike for general use(but mainly for mountain biking). 




 Thanks for the help. i am looking to do some trail riding, as you can tell im  not all that experienced ( with types of biking, i am confident on a bike). which bike would you suggest for trail riding?

 Kind of relevant, I worked in a place that served waffles for brunch, which we ran out of one day. Chef from head office happened to be there that day and what does he decide? 86 the waffles? Nope, he tells us to the store and buy fucking eggo waffles. We served 2 eggo waffles with blueberries and whipped cream for 12$. It really pissed me off.

 I just started playing destiny so I'm only level 5, but I've found a few times that I'll start a mission and some of the enemies are way to high of a level for me to beat, and they're immune at all my attacks. How do I avoid this?
Thanks and sorry if this is a stupid question 




 Those words have never stopped me before 




 I love you. 




 I hate when people complain about a shit post then still proceed to comment a huge reply.
