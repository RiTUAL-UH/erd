 I went with the 300mg advice. I felt absolutely nothing, except a little floaty feeling in my hands and legs. 




 I did a 50mg test dose. No adverse effects.

 Okay, it's my first time ever taking Adrafinil. I have looked up dosages and stuff but nothing says anything about first timers. I capped my own powder, just 2 caps, both were 600mg. Is this too much for a beginner? Any help is appreciated!

I weigh 122 lbs or 55 kg. If that helps at all. 
























 I never abused in the sense of addiction. Just in the illegality part.

I don't currently have moda (no script) but I do have Adrafinil, is this suitable? 




 I'm no professional, but I know my way around customs and drugs. I'd say just bring them in your bag, not in any container, just in the carry on/suitcase. Suitcases aren't checked as...precariously. 




 I have an incredibly bad work ethic and focus on work, I've taken all sorts of CNS (Central nervous system) stimulants. even Amphetamines, and recently I've came around to Afinil's. do you guys think these are viable option for it, if so which ones would be the best. All advice is welcome!  
























 I had the same issue with Adrafinil... I have no clue what to do, and I don't want to turn to amphetamines again... 




 i'm saying in a suitcase that you dont carry on should be pretty safe. 




 Does moda do the same thing? Or is it more of a stimulant? 
























 What do you mean what about them? 









 I've heard caffeine helps. But I had the same question. 
























 I know right? I'm not Communist and I understand that it's a "oath" but really? A felony, with a minimum of 1 year! That is straight up bullshit. 









 Doesn't mean those are things he SHOULD try.. I was wondering what else there is too... 
























 I mean of course it is. But I heard 300mg of adrafinil is about 50mg of modafinil, I took 650mg, so about 100mg of modafinil, only effects were a light body "high" i.e. my legs and hands were a little floaty. Other than that nothing. No focus no energy. 




 Does it have a come down and is there solid research done on it? 




 It does for sure. But I took 600mg of adrafinil and 18mg of caffeine 3 hours ago, still absolutely no affect. Should I try modafinil once I'm out of adrafinil? And should I continue to take my adrafinil even with no effects? 
























 That's why I was asking if they are a good alternative to things like amphetamines, which do help, but have a strong chance for addiction. I was asking for help, not a shitty analoge. But thanks. 




 First off, you only got 1 down vote and being whiny it will not help. Second,you are in a VERY biased subreddit, all idelaogical subreddits are, what did you expect? 




 This law was added in 1998... 
























 No law is truly "unenforced." 
Good evidence, glad you commented. 




 Happy? 




 It wasn't used as a gender slur, you sjw. 
























 How is it mysogonistic though? 




 I gotta find something. I really don't want to turn to amphetamines. 




 Fixed again. But I still don't quite see how saying "bitch" is an oppressive word... 
























 So here's some context. I am in highschool (I am 18) and i was staying a friends house, safe place to smoke, one of my buddies just got an RDA rebuildable ecig. I had some dabs and thought hell these would work on the ecig. I took one huge rip, then 2 decent ones. I pretty much collapsed on the bed and instantly at a [10]. After a short period of time everything started warping and I got dizzy. At this point it's about 8pm and like 30 minutes after the dab, I started tripping, straight up tripping. I saw dinosaurs that were like holograms and rainbow static there was also a screen of sorts that had some alien looking language on it that was controlling with my hands. That happened for about 30 minutes, then the worst thing happened, I vomited up everything I had eaten all day. Including Indian food. I am currently still high [4 ] over 12 hours later so my typing may be all crazy. 




 I need concentration not energy. But I'll look into it. 




 I had an Adderall script for a while. But I'm trying to avoid another one. 




 Well I've taken 600mg 2 days in a row. Still no effect. 




 I'm a student. And you think I want to be lazy? I'm trying to find a way to solve it, by asking who I thought had some concept knowledge on the subject. 




 So it doesn't matter how the word was intended to be used, but only how it was perceived? 




 5 hours now. Absolutely no effects were felt. 




 What are site confirmed to have fake adrafinil? And what exactly does adrafinil really look like?
I bought 5 grams from powdercity and it's a very pale pink color. The reason I ask is because I didn't feel anything after 600mg dosage. 

Any help is appreciated. 




 Concentration and being more alert
