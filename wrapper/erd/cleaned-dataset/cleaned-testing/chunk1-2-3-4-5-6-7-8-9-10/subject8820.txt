 No its not about the type of potatoes, it's because has to be hand made , takes 4 min to make about 20 potatoes if you wanna get nice puffed once .... 




 No I use Idaho potatoes  




 if you fry them right they stay crispy just right after you fry them touch them, if they are hard just leave them in towel to absorb the oil than they can stay crispy  




 oh cool sorry i will try to edit the link 




 pomme souffle ( puffed potatoes ) one of the expensive potatoes and you can only find it frozen ... why not make your own fresh ?
