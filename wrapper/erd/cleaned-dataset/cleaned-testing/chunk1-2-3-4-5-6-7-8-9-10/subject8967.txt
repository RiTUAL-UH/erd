 I go to college in PA, I live in Maryland when I'm not at school, and I plan to get involved in the campaign in PA and try to get others involved on my campus. 


































 Bernie a few days ago on NPR (these quotes are taken from an article written on The Hill):

 Talking about cultural divides in this country, you know, it is important for people in urban America to understand that families go out together and kids go out with their parents and they hunt and they enjoy the outdoors and that is a lifestyle that should not be condemned...if anyone thinks that gun control itself is going to solve the problem of violence in this country, you're terribly mistaken...so, obviously, we need strong, sensible gun control and I will support it. But some people think it's going to solve all of our problems. It is not."

Here is the article I am referring to:

 I was thinking the same thing, that the blood looked like it was kind of fresh. If you watch on the second time he is shot you can see the blood and it doesn't look like the blood had been soaked into the floor yet. 




 I figured this would be good to post to this thread. It is a video about marketing and what Apple does that makes them so successful. I am part of a fraternity and we use this method when recruiting, it is very helpful and I hope you all watch it if you have not already.

 makes it more unpredictable? 





























 The mask was in the passenger seat of the car driving Casper. 




 I remember in season one Marty had the horns above his head in the poster, and I looked back on the promotional posters from season 2 and found this.

The crow in the middle of the road has to be a reference to the Birdman, right?

Edit 1: By Birdman I mean the bird mask that has been shown/worn in both episodes of season 2. 
























 the world may never know then. 




 yeah I'm not a bot, just a bored college student. 





























 why was he not searched before they took him out? Is it against his rights (I'm not lawyer or a cop)? 




 There was a post like this earlier today, Donna Edwards is running in Maryland, she is a progressive. There is someone else, might want to look back and see if the post is still there.

 I am probably going to buy a few things from the store in the next few days, probably a shirt and few buttons, I was curious about shipping times? I have seen that people on here having been posting that it has taken 4+ weeks and I go back to college in a little over a month and was curious if it was still taking that long so I could know where to ship my order to (my college address or home address) 



























































 the guy Ani's father mentioned is the mayors father, that is the mayors last name (I was confused for a while too) 




 True Detective summed up: the viewer has no idea what is going on but people keep dying in the most gruesome ways regardless. 




 this might be more popular among the college voters. 
























 I agree with this claim, from personal experience. I could not go to my top school I wanted to due to cost. The school I wanted to go to was higher ranked and had tougher admission standards than the school I am attending now. Yes I was still able to go a university, but the cost was why I chose a university with lower admission standards and a lower academic rating. 









 also, I think they are more put off by the term socialist. 





























 I love this. Reminds me of the JFK quote about being a liberal. 

"If by a "Liberal" they mean someone who looks ahead and not behind, someone who welcomes new ideas without rigid reactions, someone who cares about the welfare of the people-their health, their housing, their schools, their jobs, their civil rights and their civil liberties-someone who believes we can break through the stalemate and suspicions that grip us in our policies abroad, if that is what they mean by a "Liberal", then I'm proud to say I'm a "Liberal. 




 this is a little excessive, but I think the point that u/MrFactualReality is trying to make is that Bernie has stood by his policies for his entire career. He marched on Washington with MLK, he has fought for LGBT rights since the seventies, he was/is against the Iraq War, he is against TPP. Sanders stands by his views and does not flip-flop. I think Hillary with TPP is what definitely sold me on Bernie, she took awhile to respond to it (and still has not?), while Bernie came out against it since the whole debate started. I also see her more as a moderate than Bernie, which is why Bernie appeals to me more, as I am more of a progressive. One last point, the whole 2 billion dollar fundraising goal by Hillary is not something I am a fan of. I think these are the points that u/MrFactualReality was trying to make, but was taking a much more rash stance against her. 




 is this not a form of doxxing, and thus illegal? 




 black glove Ray is the best.
