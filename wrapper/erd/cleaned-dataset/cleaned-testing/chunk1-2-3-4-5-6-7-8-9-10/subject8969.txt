 Hey, I think what you are doing is really cool, and I just recently bought the game (about two weeks before it became free) and wouldn't mind getting a free weapon/item. I normally play as sniper/medic, and sometimes heavy/spy.

Steam ID: juliusc01

Edit: Thank you so much, I really appreciate the strange sniper rifle! 
























 Happy coupon and 3 coal! 
























 Thank you for clarifying which one was saying neigh and which one was talking, otherwise I would have been confused. 
























 If you are not in, and still want to watch, I will be livestreaming at http://www.twitch.tv/anon_agon
Edit: Fun time on the server. Thanks guys! 
























 Looking forward to playing and live-streaming another match! Twitch.tv/anon_agon 



































































































 A runescape friend of mine sent me this list. Some people in my clan chat asked if I could post it on reddit so they could use it. My ingame name is An Idol. It's quite possible you are the one who sent me this.

Edit: In fact I'm guessing its you from your response. I hope you didn't mind that I posted it here. 
























 I hope you don't either man. I just have run out of ideas. I wish I could find some magical cure that can make me happy but I don't think there is one. And unfortunately, it doesn't give me much hope. 




 I know exactly what you mean. An accident that resulted in my death sounds terrific. I want to fade away into nothingness 




 I just want to be able to laugh, you know? I want to be able to play video games and go outside and have sex and be happy while doing those things. I want to be able to find things enjoyable, and when I dont, I don't get the point of living. I would give anything for the meds and therapy to work and make me better. I would sell everything I have and become a monk if that somehow got rid of my depression. I would do anything 




 Hey! Would love to join. IGN: Anon_Agon 




 I didn't compile the list myself, and it's quite possible some items might be wrong. 




 True! I didn't make this list, I just posted it on pastebin. Good catch. I can't edit it because I posted it as guest on pastebin.
