 I do wish the CBS Sports stream would quit crapping out. ROLL TIDE!! 









 Pffft we will be in the ACC long before then. :P 




 Good article. I asked a groundskeeper if they got hazard pay for football games. He said no. :(

Everyone did get holiday pay, since it was Thanksgiving break. 




 Me either.

 According to someone on Facebook with a police scanner, they apprehended a suspect before they gave the all clear.

 Our final NCAA appeal was denied, so I don't see how we can unless some bowl committee just decides to be a rebel. 




 I see what you did there. 




 [I'm partial to this for the Championship](http://i.imgur.com/To8hyMm.jpg) 




 Alright then. Rings all around, gents! 




 I think when we were FCS we only had rings made for our 6 National Championships, but I could be wrong. I can't find a link anywhere that says one way or the other.

 "Undefeated Sunbelt Champs Celebrate Season with Pizza Party, Cosmic Bowling" 




 It's our first season in the FBS.  




 Yes Fritz did really well. Our kicking frustrated me, as well as the whole 'drop back six yards to gain two' thing our QBs kept doing. He did awesome, and I could tell he was invested in the boys. But we cannot afford complacency.
 




 Why thank you :) 




 http://gseagles.com/news/2014/12/2/FB_1202141600.aspx 




 Georgia Southern fans travel VERY well (the University often sponsors bus trips) so that is not a legitimate argument against them playing. 

*kicks stupid rule* 




 Because we miss waaaay too many extra points. 









 In your own defense, it was a subtle taunt engineered to target only GaState fans. :) 




 *sadly kicks pebble around* 




 Source for this? :( 




 69-31 was an impressive win IMHO. :P 




 Another reason I'd like to see Southern play a bowl: Matt Brieda. 

He's a finalist for the Doak Walker award and more game time can only help his chances. The guys he is competing against all get that extra game. 




 Plus, Georgia southern has no transfer players in their roster. 




 Yea you're right, got confused. 




 Georgia Southern was barred from postseason FCS games last year because of the transition, but that was a team wide application. 

This page has some good info for individual athletes.

http://www.athleticscholarships.net/college-transfer-4-4.htm 




 I believe that just such a situation is what the rule was created to prevent. 

However Georgia Southern has zero transfers and significantly less scholarships than other sunbelt teams, which is why we are appealing. 




 Yeah, the stupid rule thing is my main argument. We have met (and exceeded) all the FBS qualifications. We wouldn't have made the transfer if we didn't. I'm bummed out that we are the only conference champs whose season is (probably) already over. I'm bummed out for the senior players who stuck it through the transition, beat Florida in the Swamp, earned an undefeated conference championship, and now have to watch teams they beat go play on the national stage instead. Give me a ONE MORE TIME!!  :) 




 I'm not sure what our chances are, but it would be nice. Our boys played their hearts out this season. HAIL SOUTHERN! 









 Nope, just a tech fan but thanks for playing slugger! 




 Lol thanks much. It does suck :(  




 Yea poor GSU ball :( 




 No worries, different approaches. :) 




 Lmao that would be the boyfriend I credited my post to. Too funny. 




 This was my boyfriend's suggestion.  









 Yes. Yes it is. 




 We are in a transitional season since we moved up from the SoCON last year. It's a NCAA rule. We put in a waiver request but we're denied. We have appealed the decision. We are 8-0 Sunbelt Champs and 9-3 overall in our first FBS season. Teams we squished will be going instead of us. :( 




 Lol 




 http://imgur.com/8s4MPqp 




 http://imgur.com/8s4MPqp 




 Yea I noticed that too hehe but we have had that blue and white uniform style since Erk brought the program back because it was all we could afford. I think it's very classy.

 It was really nice to see Youyoute get some good ball time in his last game. :) 
























 We made it to the table of 32. But still... HAIL SOUTHERN 




 [Next year we get the Cure Bowl in Orlando against an AAC team](http://curebowl.com)

The fifth bid starting in 2016 is actually gonna be on a rotational basis between a handful of conferences.  




 Sun Belt gets a fourth bowl bid next year, and a fifth after that. But Georgia Southern and CrApp State will be eligible so Texas might miss out again. :P 




 Yeah Georgia Southern is just buried in that article. :( 




 Lol Georgia Southern went 9-3 in their first season in the FBS and came within a score of beating both our ACC opponents this season. We ain't no cupcake team. 




 Aww sorry Sam Houston Bro. :( We are taking good care of him! 




 HAIL SOUTHERN :) 




 LOL I never thought about it that way but you are right. :) 









 Ooh that's neat! I like the buddy ticket idea. I'm sad you can't sit on the hill anymore though. :( 




 I work for UA Museums. Love it!  




 When I was at Georgia Southern (I graduated in '12) the football games were free if you paid your athletic fee (about 150? but it included other things like renovation costs and the rec center access too).

I work for the University of Alabama and they run a fac/staff season ticket lottery based on seniority. You have to buy the whole season. 




 Why not State of Georgia University Panthers? 




 [Here this friendly PSA should clear up any confusion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=putYM15zC0Y feature=youtu.be) 




 [NO](http://mylolface.com/assets/faces/angry-no.jpg) 




 I get so sad that people still get confused by this. :( 




 Overall an exemplary season for the Panthers. They do a good job keeping Paulson North warm for us. 




 Hey they did their best to only win by one point. Don't be too hard on em. 




 Awesome. That makes me happy. 




 GSU AD actually reached out to the NCAA about doing it. Betcha can guess what those bastards said. :( 




 NCAA- Not Controlling Athletics Association /s 




 Kleinlein is a stand up guy. 









 All of them. The answer is all of them. 




 I bet someone down Auburn way might take him. ;) 




 I'm glad we could help you guys reach 15,006 average attendance.
 




 OK I'm gonna use Alabama, because I work there. [They had eight players drafted in 2014](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Alabama_Crimson_Tide_players_in_the_NFL_draft).

Their starting kicker, Cade Foster, was not among them. He is now a free agent. 

Players like that, who don't get drafted yet expected to. What kind of a future can they look forward to? What's the likelihood they will get picked up? Do they have skills they can fall back on if not? I'm legitimately concerned. The graduation - employment rate is low enough as it is. I should know I am a (gainfully employed!) recent anthropology grad. :) 




 If their coaches are not properly educating their players about what a long shot it is (about 3% according to the NCAA website, but that's across all divisions) then they are doing those kids a disservice. I'd really like to know what happens to the kid who stakes all his hopes on getting into the NFL and prepared for no other option. What does he do? Flip burgers? 




 Yeah but they're not all gonna get drafted.
 




 I enjoyed the analysis of this article and I'd like to see the data from other Universities. I feel like this should all be public information for any public institution. 




 I always implore our defense to squish 'em, but I never claimed to not be weird. 




 GREATEST THING 




 Georgia Southern was the first team to be undefeated in conference/outright champs in the first year of transition since the rule was made. 

Still sad panda. :( 




 I read somewhere that ODU wasn't eligible either because of transition. 




 I think you got down votes because most Georgia Southern Fans don't think very highly of UGA even though we can't really be considered football 'rivals.' A lot of it goes way back to when Erk Russell left UGA to start our program. Some of it has to do with how hard they fought to block us becoming a University as well. We like Tech though. 




 HAIL SOUTHERN 




 YES 




 Yes, that is also a good one because it shows us being classy in our celebrations. 




 So we should change it to mountain goats, or what? 




 LOL @ CrApp State Sheep and Sad Georgia State ball. :)

 I would attend this game.

However wouldn't Georgia Southern get in trouble? :( 




 The difference is Georgia Southern went 8-0 in conference play and holds an outright championship.

EDIT TO ADD- And we are the first team to have done so since the rule was implemented. 




 Almost like they are rewarding certain conferences for having an actual championship game... Hmmm ;) 




 Those boys are not giving up... LOVE IT GO JACKETS

They have a cold bar that everyone has access to and then a nice looking menu you order from. The cold bar has some shellfish, cured meats and cheeses from Scandinavia. There are some wonderful sounding Scandinavian entrees as well that we are excited about! I should mention that Akershus is a Princess meal.

 Important question re the new Bluray edition: Did they get rid of Morrison's Boba Fett redub? :/ 




 *claps* 




 Yeah, that's what my W2 says, not counting SS/Medicare. 




 What? No wai. ;____; 




 It says 969.63. I'm beginning to suspect my W4 is not right, and I got lucky last year. 




 Alright, just me then. Thanks! 




 I changed jobs in 2013, but there wasn't any space between them. That is an awesome tool! Our accountant at work advised me to redo my W4 and I will definitely be using that. Thanks! 




 Can you claim yourself as a dependent? I have never found a satisfactory answer to that. I just learned I can get tax help through my employer so I will go that route too because I don't know how much information I feel comfortable putting on reddit. :) 




 Oh, okay. Thanks for explaining. 




 I have more student loan interest this year, because I just rehabilitated them (yay for me!). I haven't finished filing yet, but I did not pick dependent. 




 What else do you need? I'm new at this. 




 I have excellent health insurance provided by my employer, which I pay a small amount for each month. Does that cover me? 




 That's a good suggestion. I'll try that when I get home! 




 Credit! I'm sorry. That's my bad. My only CREDIT was student loan interest. I did take the standard deduction. 




 Background: I make less than 25K, single lady with no kids. I am not in school, I work full time for a public university. GREAT benefits. 

I owe $470 on my tax return. This is a substantial amount of money for me, and it's going to decimate the small savings I have managed to put by. Last year, I got a small refund. My income and withholding, as stated, has not changed. I'm confused and sad. :( 

I just put everything through a Federal Free Edition on Turbotax, and my only credit was for Student Loan Interest. 

TLDR: ELI5 why it's different so I don't get pissy and mail off a bunch of pennies. Please and thank you. 3

Edit- Changed deduction to credit 




 You have to cancel these at least 24-48 hours in advance, so maybe someone is sitting on a reservation until it gets closer and they have to really decide which they want. Keep trying! I was able to make one last week for breakfast on May 6 so it could definitely happen! Keep trying and May the Force Be With You. 




 I like this idea.

 All of them. You can get GBA ones and play those on the Lite. Start with Fire Red or Leaf Green.
 




 Thanks for the tip. I think that's what we have decided to do. Better safe than sorry! 




 I appreciate the tip! :) 




 Awesome!! I didn't know you could try more than one thing. :D 

It is a little pricey, but I keep telling myself how many awesome benefits there are to it. :3 

How was the food? 




 Awesome, thanks. We really just wanted to bring the hilts to wear around, since our blades don't collapse. That's an awesome story about the sonic screwdriver! :D 




 That's awesome to hear to hear! I've never done a character meal before, but we are so looking forward to it! Thanks! :) 




 Does anyone know if there is a policy on this? My boyfriend and I are going in May (and we have the Star Wars Character breakfast reserved!) and we were wondering if we could wear our sabers. Thanks! :D

They are high quality dueling sabers, but we would leave the blades in the hotel of course!! 




 So if we booked yesterday, the price shouldn't change, right? First time bookers here, Thanks! 




 Thanks I managed to arrange something and will use that next time :) 




 Hey guys, I have an extra samurai from set 13 that I'd really love to trade for the fencer. Please let me knew if anyone would like to do this trade! :) Thanks!

 I think it has more to do with certain State fans thinking their football program was better because it jumped to FBS after one season. We never played each other until 2014 and apparently that made us Eagles look like we were 'scared.'

This was then further exacerbated by clueless announcers calling Georgia Southern Georgia State on multiple occasions. [Friendly PSA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=putYM15zC0Y) 




 Disney has shown the Boba Fett portion of the Holiday Special at special character dining events at WDW. Stranger things have happened.

 KICK TO WIN 




 Yeah, kickers are not usually sought after recruits with a tight scholarship budget. Fritz knew what we needed though. 




 I dont know if there will be a ramp-up to buying for Star Wars,' Iger said, with most merchandise tied to a film typically selling around its release.

LOL that's not how Star Wars works Bob. If you sell it, they will buy. 




 I'm excited. We have had a few seasons now where the kicking has not been stellar. I'm talking about regular missed PAT. 




 Hail Southern! We can kick football now! :D 









 Good to know, thanks. 




 I am going to try at Midnight EST, fwiw. 




 I already have an alarm set to remind me to try for lunch reservations for my trip. *fingers crossed* 




 The boat rides were my favorite part. Also the cute cute architecture! I also enjoyed how the bus stop was nice and shady. The Gurgling Suitcase bar was also very fun! 




 Adorable! 




 They look like tsum tsums! :D 




 Mine's 500, just like the student card I screwed everything up with. It's my second card ever, so that probably has something to do with it. 




 Capital One has some cards for rebuilding. My SO is helping me rebuild for the same reason. I got one (with a tiny limit) immediately approved from Capital One so now I can start on the right path. Good luck!

I also bank with Capital One 360, so this may have helped me out. YMMV

 Do you think I am defending her or something? I am confused as to why you are taking this so personally. 




 Thank you for dramatically correcting my opinion of a person neither of us know anything significant about beyond OP's post. I really appreciate your guidance. 




 No, but that's where it began. She found out something she didn't like about her boyfriend and let it fester until she did something drastic instead of talking to him about it and letting him know how she felt and also trying to see his side of things. I agree that it is a selfish way to be. 




 Coming from a chick here- She's overreacting and does not know how to communicate about what bothers her on an adult level.

Sure it hurts you now and don't let anyone tell you it shouldn't because that's an important part of the healing process. But you will be much happier being with someone who respects you more than that. 




 Good advice. I definitely think the breakfast will be one of the highlights of our trip. Getting the TS Fastpass sounds like the safe option! Thank you! 




 I'm sorry to hear that! I think I have been convinced to get the TS FP! 




 Thank you! Y'all have convinced me! 




 I really appreciate your in-depth reply. I would be more upset missing TS than RnRC, not sure how my SO feels though. It sounds like I should stick with Toy Story! :) Thanks! 




 Hello friends. I am trying to determine if I am making a HUGE mistake. I think I have decided to risk NOT FP+ing Toy Story Midway Mania. I know, I know! Let me explain.

We have an 8:25 AM Galactic Dine In Star Wars Breakfast Reservation at the Sci Fi Dine In Restaurant for May 6. The park opens at 9. Since I can either FP+ Toy Story or the Rockin Roller Coaster, I think I am going to chance it and take the Roller Coaster since we are so close to Toy Story in the park. I don't want to rush through the breakfast either though so I guess my question is, how soon after 9 AM does the line become unbearable for Toy Story? I have done it before, and it was WONDERFUL and my SO has never done it (and I know he would love it). 

What do you think? Thanks in advance and may the force be with you! 




 You can team up with a partner on Star Wars: The Old Republic. My boyfriend and I are paired up and playing through the Knight/Consular story lines together. It's awesome and you get two story lines at the same time. We also have a Bounty Hunter/Imperial Spy game going. 




 If your party likes movies/Star Wars/Pixar/Muppets then HS. Epcot for international flair! Shopping, food, and awesome fireworks.  




 Thanks! 




 Crossing my fingers for May... 




 Etsy is great too. I just got a set of Chewbacca ears there. Find a seller who makes ones you like, then ask if they will do a custom order. 




 The only special thing is that HS has tiers for their fast passes, so you can only make reservations for one A ride and 2 B rides. 

Toy Story Mania and Rockin Roller Coaster are both A.  




 Sorry to hijack but do you know when Pirates will be down? Thanks. :( 




 That's pretty much how Teavana makes their money.
 




 The first time I saw it it started just as we were getting to MK from Epcot after watching Illuminations and we saw part from the Monorail and that was awesome! We watched the rest from the plaza near the ticket center. 




 Or crepes... 
























 I always thought this was why guys pissed standing up. 




 I just got a new windows machine (Dell XPS 13 '15 edition) and I LOVE the snapping feature.

Prior, my primary machine was a 27 inch iMac, so never really hurt for screen space hehe. 




 An app would be awesome.

Besides that, I stopped playing in Nov. 2012 and only just picked it back up this month. NOTHING HAS CHANGED. Even the popular NC items are the same.  




 Yeah, but I think it's more socially acceptable for us ladies to tell people to stuff it for commenting about what we like. 




 Yep yep yep 10000x yep.

This is my biggest grammar pet peeve, because I feel like when people use 'I' when they should use 'me,' they are incorrectly patting themselves on the back for 'remembering the rule.'

 The one wearing shorts must start the conversation and wax poetic at length about the awesomeness of shorts. 




 There's speculation elsewhere in the thread that may answer your question. 




 Ambiguous 'natural' flavors in some flavored teas. 




 That was Arvel Crynyd. The female A-Wing pilot who was redubbed was Sila Kott. It's an easy mistake though because they look similar in their gear. 




 [Yeah she was awesome.](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Dine_Ellberger) 




 An excellent point! 




 Porkins bein porkins. 




 AND the guy who gets Indy to go find the Ark of the Covenant. Dude gets around. 




 In the Outer Rim, I'd rather be dead than maimed to be honest lol. 




 Natural flavorings can still be ambiguous. There's a natural flavoring in one of their raspberry herbals that doesn't agree with me that in no way comes from a raspberry. That said, Adagio is my preferred tea retailer! 




 I'm not sure. There is one reference to a female pod racer by Anakin in an EU novel, but it's to describe how horrifically she died.  




 Nope. None whatsoever. :( 




 [She was. Then overdubbed with a male voice](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Sila_Kott)
 




 I have never had a problem with Adagio and their customer service is quite good. I think they use less artificial flavors than Teavana, although they are not completely 'clean.' 




 So useful. Go for it. 




 There were some in the Battle for Naboo! :) 




 The comments in that article make me a sad panda. [Also](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Sila_Kott) 









 Thank you. 




 "It is very likely that at least some degree of Ebola virus transmission currently occurs via infectious aerosols generated from the gastrointestinal tract, the respiratory tract, or medical procedures, although this has been difficult to definitively demonstrate or rule out, since those exposed to infectious aerosols also are most likely to be in close proximity to, and in direct contact with, an infected case,"

Yep so people will be fear mongering with this even though the scientists admitted it was impossible to control for.

Also

Thursday's study examines the idea that minuscule droplets of body fluid containing the virus could hang in the air and be inhaled by others, providing an unrecognized, if minor, pathway for the virus.

Not the same thing as an Ebola mutated to be airborne!

 Archaholic alkeyologists 




 In my experience, I have observed that we get a lot of questions about what it is like to be an archaeologist. Which tells me that like most scientists, we are not so great at communicating what it is we do exactly with the general public.

As a general rule, archaeology is not sexy and I have never seen it portrayed accurately in a film for this reason. For something closer to accurate, think "Scrubs" except with shovels. Most archaeologists work project to project, usually on something related to infrastructure. These projects are conducted in advance of construction projects making use of federal funds. Very rarely does anyone go looking for something in particular (because of confirmation bias for one thing) because archaeology is EXPENSIVE when you do it right, which includes proper excavation and reporting techniques. There is no quick way to earn respect but shitty excavation practices and bad ethics is a hell of a way to lose it.

I'm fortunate enough to be salaried at a major American university, but that also means I no longer do much digging. My main focus is on public education. 

Best of luck with your project!

Also, we as a whole have zero fashion sense. Jeans, a button down and boots with most of the dirt knocked off is professional attire. I love it. 




 Your home scale might not be calibrated the same as the one at the doctor. If your clothes feel the same you did not gain ten pounds.

 42 hours last week, 38 hours this week. It works out, but it's shifty. 




 No worries. I'm an archaeologist and I understand taking a shit job early career on the other side of the country to get your foot in the door. Best of luck. 




 I really like Atlanta. The area around GaTech is pretty cool and they have a lot of music festivals in the area. Some great museums as well. Can't comment on the dating scene though. Oh and the bars in Buckhead are EXPENSIVE.

 Are you in the US or Europe? That will help us narrow down which programs are available near you.

In the US, generally your bachelor's will be in Anthropology. 




 What a magical family moment that I guarantee will not be brought up repeatedly at your wedding. 




 The only thing that bothers me about 'pre-Clovis' is that the nomenclature presupposes that these earlier occupations eventually became the Clovis culture when they have just as much possibility of being something else entirely. 




 Stone tools didn't necessarily have a long life, no, but I like to think that if someone broke their big lovely spear point that they might reuse part of it as, say, a hide scraper. :) 




 Cahokia (and all other Mississippian polities) lacked a system of writing that we know of so *technically* not a civilization (although it meets all the other criteria). I tend to leave it at complex society and call it a day. There are many problems with the current definition of civilization, especially the implication that cultures that don't meet the criteria are 'uncivilized.' 




 The person who wrote that article knows jack shit about archaeology.

It is an intriguing find, however. 




 I am an archaeologist and my boyfriend and I have talked about getting tattoos on our ring fingers for when we are not wearing our rings. I definitely don't want to damage mine while working! 




 r/highschoolproblems 




 Yes. Do this. 




 fuckfuckfucfuckfuckfuckfuck 




 I'm considering the same, so I'm just gonna lurk here lol. 




 I vote for infected ingrown hair too. 




 Move relearner would do it I think. 




 I'm playing Pokemon Green now. It's hard because it's in Japanese lol. 




 CM says yes!

Now I have hope! I think I might get a new camera. We only have two park days, so $169 for pics makes me sad when I can get a new camera for that money, take my own pics and ask CMs to take pics of both of us. 




 I will not have Memory Maker though. I had been under the impression that you didn't need MM for these meals because the photos were included in the price.  




 Hi everyone, I have a couple character meals that traditionally include photos (whether you have MM or not) and I just read on a different forum conflicting reports about whether they stopped this at the beginning of the year or not. The ones I have booked are Akershus and Star Wars Galactic Breakfast. I'll be so disappointed to not get photos. :( 




 Huh, I didn't know that! Thanks! 




 Snap is the game I always wanted to play as a kid. Finally got it and a used 64 a couple years ago and was so happy. 




 Someone above said you could get the R/S one on the WiiU 




 Sadness! 




 Blue table FTW!

I never beat HAL's top score lol. 




 I would so buy a Gen IV pinball game!
 




 Yeah it took up premium space in my case lol. 




 The rumble on my cart stopped working. ;_; 




 The gameplay is very similar. The graphics, 'mons, and physics are updated of course and there are a couple more things to interact with on the table. Also Spoink shoots your pinball so you can control the speed of the ball, something which the original version lacks. Two thumbs up can recommend.

Does not rumble though. :( 




 Mine too! I saved so much for it and loved how it vibrated.

Actually I may have more hours on Diamond now that I think on it.

But back in the day, definitely. 




 Blue table for life. 









 Awesome :) 




 Wow how is that even legal? 




 The whole website was broken. I bet they are not all gone. 




 Mine is showing up in MDE now yayayay 




 I wonder if the poor cast members were all dreading today. 




 I got mine for when I wanted, but it's not showing on my reservations. I too am believing that my confirmation email means I am good! 




 If I was the random lady, I'd check the item in my trunk and try to contact the owner if the instrument had any contact info on it. 




 My boyfriend and I are going for our first trip together in May! 3 (70 days!!)

We are staying at POP Century and checking in on May 5th. Our first night there we are having dinner at Boatwrights at Port Orleans Riverside. Following that, my plan is to head over to the Polynesian for a Lapu Lapu at the Tambu Lounge while we watch Wishes from the beach. Then back home, since we have an early day the next day!

May 6th we have booked the Star Wars Galactic Dine In Character Breakfast at Hollywood Studios for 8:25 AM! I am SO EXCITED about this! My fastpasses for HS will include Toy Story, Tower of Terror and Star Tours. I'd also like to see the Indiana Jones Stunt Spectacular and MuppetVision 3D.

We are then park hopping to Epcot where we will drink and snack our way around the world showcase and flower and garden festival. Hopefully we can also ride Spaceship Earth! We have dinner reservations at Akershus after which we will find a spot for IllumiNations. RIGHT AFTER IllumiNations we will beat it to the Monorail and head to the Magic Kingdom. Hopefully we will arrive in time for Wishes! Seeing it from the Monorail height is pretty awesome. Finally, we will catch the Electric Parade then call it a night.

May 7 we will get up SUPER EARLY for EMH at the Magic Kingdom! I plan on filling myself with Mickey Waffles at the POP restaurant. Then we will try and get to the park in time for the opening show! My plan is to FP+ Peter Pan, 7 Dwarves, and Buzz Lightyear. I plan to head to Space Mountain first thing, do Buzz, then turn around and do Pirates, Haunted Mansion, then spend most of our time in Fantasyland getting all the major rides. We currently have lunch reservations for Tony's, but I am crossing my fingers I will be able to get Be Our Guest tomorrow! We will finish our day in the Magic Kingdom with the new Fantasy Parade.

After that, we will head back to Hollywood Studios! We will do any shows we missed the day before, Rockin Rollercoaster, Star Tours AGAIN! Then, we have dinner reservations at 50's Prime Time Cafe after which we can hopefully grab a seat at Fantasmic! Then finally we will head home and get to sleep in a little hehe.

May 8 we have a late AM breakfast reservation at Olivia's at Old Key West. Then we will take a boat to Downtown Disney where we will look around and shop. We have a late lunch reserved at Fulton's and dinner reservations at Raglan Road. We also have tickets to see Nightwish and Sabaton at House of Blues! :D

May 9- Checkout day. :( I want to walk over the bridge to see Art of Animation and have breakfast or lunch there before we leave.

We are celebrating our 1st Anniversary as a couple and are so excited. 3 




 Absolutely. Although, I must say I only use Photoshop/Illustrator/InDesign out of the suite, so I can only comment on those. I was working at home on a magazine layout for work recently and the XPS navigated the file better than the 6 months old 27 inch iMac I have at work. I missed the big screen though hehe. I have not tried processing HUGE raster files with the XPS yet though. Just edited a batch of photos here at work and the response time was great. 




 I got it directly from Dell and upgraded the solid state to 256 mb. I have 8 gb of ram and the i5 processor. No touch screen. It's my first PC after being Mac only for 5+ years and I am very happy. 




 One looked like an abrader to me. 




 I do a lot of Photoshop/InDesign etc. at work and have downloaded CC for my XPS and the first thing I noticed is how FAST the programs open up. That's the solid state! I have never had my fan kick on when using the Adobe suite (yet). My fan kicks on only when I am using almost all of the CPU power. 




 In the US, most archaeologists have an anthropology degree because pedagogy over here follows Boas and the four fields approach. 




 So none of those look Paleo to me. They look Archaic/Woodland but it really depends on the part of the country they came from (context context context!) See if the historical society or one of your professors will help you get it recorded in the state site file. Or even better, perhaps there is a nearby professional firm that can help get it recorded. 

The thing is, the actual stuff you found may be cool and all, but it's a lot more useful to the scientific community when we can study the relationships between the artifacts and any features that may have been present. Remember, you can't put it back once its excavated! 




 Mine does it (ordered from Dell) but the fan only kicks on when I'm gaming, and I tend to have a headset on so I don't really notice it. 




 Actually not funny. 




 Nice 




 Starting Wednesday they will be taking lunch reservations for BoG. You should give it a shot! 





























 I want an AR Pokemon Snap for the 3DS. It could be so cool! 




 *cries* 




 I didn't think about making backups! Awesome. 




 I am not a good enough person to loan out my Pokemon games lol. But I do like the idea of a game card for it. 




 Ooh the PokeBank looks cool! I'm definitely going to have to check that out! Thank you for such an indepth answer :) 




 I'm leaning towards the new 3DS since it has better everything compared to the other models you can get new, although the colors don't excite me. :/

I think I am gonna go for Pokemon Y to start with although I eventually want Alpha Sapphire too.

Are there any bundles I should look for? Is it better to get the cartridge or download the game digitally? [I would cry if my pokes became corrupted]

Also, how easy is it for me to send mons from Diamond or HG or Black?

Thanks y'all! 




 I spent less than half that on two degrees. I suggest you find a less expensive college or get some scholarships. 




 Girls like that go to football games too. No really, I LOVE having your shrieks permanently damage my hearing. I'm sorry you feel threatened by the fact that my big muscly boyfriend is wearing the other team's shirt. 




 Those are tiny! :O 




 Why thank you. :)

Yes the garland is NC, it is from the first festival of neggs iirc.

Soo cute! I love how they are hiding in the flowers. :D 




 Aww thanks! :3 




 Aww congrats! :) 




 Yeah that does sound complimentary. The difference for me was that my minor was required to graduate and therefore took no additional time since I worked on it at the same time as my major classes. 




 Thank you :3 




 Well, my minor was very complimentary to my major and has resulted in making me stand out in the job market because of that additional skillset. 




 Thanks! She is wearing the Dark Faerie Eye Shadow. It was a random prize during the Faerie Quest event recently. 




 I feel like your Draik would make an awesome meal from the fruits of her garden. :) 




 Aww he looks so dapper! :) 









 I had one that I bought in the US and it had Japanese characters too so IDK if that means much. 




 My period always makes me ravenous.
 




 Yes! That describes my booty exactly lol. Do iiiiiiit! 




 I think it has been breaking my flash in Google Chrome (I'm on a PC). 




 Jadzia is my favorite Dax. 3 




 [It's this doll](https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3331/5733577662_229f3a6ddd.jpg)

John Smith from Pocahontas 




 OK now I feel old. *cries*

Love those games... 




 I broke my tailbone when I was younger, and it healed at a bit of a different angle. That combined with the fact that there is not much junk in my trunk means that when I sit on my boyfriend's lap wrong, he is jabbed by my coccyx.


He calls it my ass dagger. 




 I would play this. It would probably be the straw that finally made me break down and buy a 3DS. 




 That's pretty low. :/ It's not up to him what you look like, only up to you!

I'd suggest getting single serving stuff or focusing more on veggies and things he can't sneak sugar into. Also, the best diet tip is drink nothing but water so it would be pretty hard for him to sabotage that. :) 




 Had to google fupa... kinda wish I didn't. ;_; 




 I would just ASPLODE if I got to meet Anna and Elsa at Akershus! 3 We have dinner reservations in May so PLEASEEEEE Disney! 




 Sure go ahead. 




 Do y'all do anything with Star Trek Online as an RP vehicle? My fleet RPs with the in game chat, but it's kinda flaky so my boyfriend and I have been exploring other options. 




 No, not at all. Good luck OP. :) (and yes he is amazing!) 




 I've been attacked by someone I trusted. The only person I have told (until now I suppose!) is my future husband, because I wanted to make sure he didn't feel hurt if I had to pull away during intimate moments that became overwhelming. I told him I had something important to tell him. I cried. He held me. I felt better. 




 My ideas are checking your paystubs with your employer or looking at all the deposits into your bank account. I do not know if this will work for your particular situation, but it is where I would start if it was me. Good luck OP that sounds really scary. ;_; 




 So does that spoon come in a cereal box or what? How do acquire? :D 




 You need to decline Delina's quest by clicking the X. 




 I did not read the article because the authors failed to differentiate between biological sex (the word female) and gender (the word man) in the first paragraph and it made me a sad science panda.

 




 Fair enough. 




 ^That's ^what ^analgesic ^means. 




 He could chew on the cane and acquire nutrients. Also it provided a natural analgesic. 




 Yoda's cane (gimer stick) was also nutritional.

EDIT- Denis Lawson is Ewan McGregor's Uncle. 




 healthy, -to-2 pack-per-day smokers

I LOL'd. 




 Thanks! :) 




 It sounds like your family could use some happy news. It sounds tough, but happy things like weddings usually lift everyone up. *hugs OP* 









 I am super impressed! :D I thought it was an actual service Lego offered. 




 Anybody hear anything about Space Mountain refurb in April/May? Folks on a different page have reported fast pass cancellation. 




 Aww thanks. :) 




 Probably. I was trying to say that without directly accusing the OP of being abusive. 




 Her name is Treek and she is in the Cartel Market and is a tank/healer. You can use her for any class either Imperial or Republic. Kind of pricey if you don't catch a sale though. But it's totally awesome she swoops into battle on one of those little hang gliders, summons bees as a taunt, and stabs herself in the leg with a healing dart when her health is low.  




 It sucks dude but it is absolutely her decision to make. Chalk it up to a life experience and apply these lessons to your next relationship. 




 Thank you. Leia was a badass. 
























 That's pretty cool! :D 




 Yes, thank you! I had a looooot of time between knowing I wanted to get the band and finally getting it so I did a lot of research.

I'm glad you like it! :D 




 He must have been so excited :D 




 I think it comes from the same part of my brain that wouldn't allow any connection with my college students on social media. Educators have to treat these things differently. 




 I work at a museum and I bring my 3DS to collect steps for playcoins on my lunch break basically (and that Pokemon Shuffle fix) and I noticed when I got home I had a streetpass from one of the kids I gave a guided tour to today. SO now I feel a bit creepy but hey at least I got an Eon ticket out of it. xD 




 Aw! Thank you so much! :D 




 Aww gosh thank you so much! I used metallic temporary tattoos I found on Amazon and sealed it with base coat nail polish.

3 




 Thank you! I bet yours are in the mail then eh? 









 I'm bringing a rubber Darth Vader keychain :D

I heard they trade you pins sometimes. 




 Ouch that sucks :( 




 Definitely file a claim with etsy. They are pretty good about getting your money taken care of.  




 It's not broken. It has a superficial scratch that screen protectors would have prevented. 




 Try repairing your download from the eShop settings. It fixed the issue for me! 




 You see the icons on your desktop and think about how to slide them to make the best combo.

Add yours! 




 Sitting on my Diamond and Platinum carts hehe. I have JPN Movie Darkrai, US Movie Darkrai, and the Pokemon Ranger Darkrai. 




 Because I like Munchlax too. It's so hard to choose between favorites! D: 




 Yes Darkrai is awesome! I'd love to see pics of your collection. 3 




 Pokemon X/Y is glorious. You would probably enjoy Omega Ruby or Alpha Sapphire too. 

I am not a huge fan of Black/White, but I do heartily recommend Heart Gold/Soul Silver and Diamond/Pearl/Platinum. But you don't need them for Pokemon X/Y to make you happy. 




 Yes! :D Darkrai is awesome! :D 




 Dem cicada hands doe.... 




 Yes I did like it, thank you! :D 




 Darkrai FTW :3 I actually used to have two of those holders. Can't find the other one. :/ 




 That's a really good manga though! :) 




 Pikachu actually :3 




 Thanks :D 




 Hehe yeah I was wondering who would notice. 




 Thanks. That would be a nice addition for when Darkrai wants a snack. 




 Eh, not so much. 









 Poke Mac n Cheese always tasted better. My bro and I were convinced the cheese sauce was different, but my adult logic knows that the shapes just held the sauce better than the elbows. 




 Hah you have those little cutouts from the Mac n Cheese boxes. 




 I have heard that having a big combo multiplier helps with catchability. I have not progressed far enough in the game to get to Groudon or Kyogre though. 




 I'm planning on bringing mine to Disney next month :) Good to know I will get lots of passes! 




 Totally! 




 You could use Pokemon for things like that in the Ranger games. It was great. 




 That would be beautiful. :O 




 Definitely. Black was such a let down for me after Diamond. 




 This is adorable. 

^^^My ^^^biological ^^^clock ^^^is ^^^going ^^^CRAZY 




 I've put the most hours into Pokemon Diamond and thought that was the pinnacle of Pokemons, but I just started X and basically it's the Pokemon game I have wanted since 1998 and is amazing. 




 I was tempted to make a throwaway, since the institution I work for is dealing with a potentially hairy NAGPRA claim right now but I have to say that yes I do. I don't know if NAGPRA is the law you are referring to (and I don't have much knowledge of legislation in other countries) but I do support reburial. I also support scientific study of remains. I know from personal experiences that compromises can be made that allow for study and documentation prior to repatriation.

Also, I can't think of a single example where remains in a historic context were not reinterred as soon as practical. Historic cemeteries are always moved if the archaeology is done right. I don't see why this same attitude does not get applied to prehistoric remains that lack a cultural association. They're still people! 




 That's awesome! :D Thanks! 




 Wait wait... I just started Gen VI and you can breed into specific balls now? O_O Too cool! 




 I've really been enjoying Wondertrade. I just got a Helioptile named H-Dawg lmao 




 The bug is usually the one thing I DO evolve haha. 




 Nido FTW 




 I like to keep my starters cute for as long as possible lol. 




 That's a nifty challenge! :3 




 Haha ouch yeah that would be difficult. 




 Yeah those games turned me off too. I'm grumpy that I need to finish my Black that I haven't touched in four years to get Pokes from my Diamond/Platinum/Heart Gold sent up to my new game.  




 Aww :3 




 Nice! Yeah I do the leveling thing too. It kinda threw me off in X when my happier Pokes started getting boosted XP.
 




 And I miss out on Raichu because I refuse to evolve my Pikachu lol. That's pretty cute. :)
 




 So waaaay back in my first Pokemon game (Yellow) one of the members of my team was Nidoking. I didn't have any water types on my final crew I guess so I taught my Nidoking Surf because he could learn it for some reason. Ever since, in FR and HG and just today in X my Nidoking on my team has known Surf. 3

I think my first team was Pikachu, Nidoking, Scyther, Charizard, Articuno ... and someone else. I can't remember the sixth pokemon. ;-; EDIT- Haunter. I think it was Haunter.

What sorts of things do you carry over game to game? 




 They are Banpresto prize plush from 1998 and SUPER RARE! They are called bell plush because they have a tiny jingle bell on them. Laptop for scale. I loves them so much. 3 
























 [Here is an article I wrote about good apps I use](http://thesga.org/2013/07/ten-essential-mobile-apps-for-the-archaeologist/) 




 They have it at Disneyworld too in Hollywood Studios. 




 I think anthropology is a wonderful discipline, but I got into the field knowing it was not a moneymaker and jobs were hard to come by. However, I do know a couple single moms who are badass archaeologists. 

Anthropology is very complimentary with many other fields, including business and sales, because of how it teaches people to better understand other people. Perhaps you could minor in Anthro and use it to complement something else that you would enjoy if you are worried about employability. 

If all else fails, many states and cities in the US have archaeology societies that welcome avocational (people without degrees) and professional archaeologists alike. These groups have regular meetings and presentations and often organize volunteer excavations. Perhaps finding a group like this in your area can even help you with your decision. If you're in the southeast, PM me for some leads on these groups. 

Best of luck! It's a hard road, but if you know what you are getting into it can be a rewarding journey. 




 I would probably "kill them with kindness," by being really nice about it but thinking vindictive things to myself about how much money they are spending and how much extra calories I don't have to worry about. :x 




 Hey you Pikachu? 




 How do you get flaired? I'm new here. 




 Yes they do! :) 




 We mainly get 4th graders here, and yes most of them are adorable. :) Also thank you! 




 People don't fit into neatly defined boxes on a census form, no matter how much sociologists wish they would. 




 People are people.

I am a museum educator at a Mississippian site in the US, and children ask me all the time things like "Why are they dressed like that?" I usually turn it around and ask them, "Well why did you choose that shirt today?" And then their little brains go "oooooh," and we get one step closer to cultural empathy.  




 I called 10 days prior and then asked again when we checked in. All we wanted was a King size bed and they made it happen. 




 We were at WDW celebrating our anniversary last week and I wore my anniversary pin everywhere. One of the castmembers at the Fiesta de Jardin booth at the Flower and Garden festival was commenting how the 1st anniversary should be extra special and gave us an extra flan. I think it helped that we were talking in spanish! :) I loved having everyone wish us a happy anniversary. :) 




 I came. o_o 




 Why thank you :) 




 I'm not sure what that means, but I can say they were goooooood! 




 The weekends haven't gotten started yet so Darth's Mall wasn't open for us. :( They start the character meals on May 4th. 




 Thanks and you're welcome! It's a great pin. :D 




 Haaaaaah that's awesome! 




 Definitely! 




 I was kinda sad they didn't have that going last week, but it looks really great! Have fun! 




 That's awesome! I'm super grateful to your cousin then! 




 It was a really intricate costume! His helmet scanner even flipped down. No voice, but somehow that made them even more menacing. 




 We had an awesome time!! The character interaction was wonderful (I have to say though I think it depends on how into it the guest is- you gotta give them something to work with people!), the food was AMAZING, and the atmosphere was spectacular (Sci Fi Dine-In).

We arrived for our 8:25 reservation with a few minutes to spare, checked in, and mingled with other guests while we waited to join the rebellion. Once your rebel cell is called, you join the line to meet [Darth Vader and Boba Fett](http://i.imgur.com/1mcxNdb.jpg). As you can guess from my outfit, I was not too popular with them! Fett liked my boyfriends' shirt though of course. Boba scanned me with his helmet eyepiece and tried to collect my bounty. He was also not impressed by my ears! Darth Vader went as far as taking my Chewbacca plushie, holding it up for the crowd to see, then turning back towards me and slowly and deliberate wringing his neck before dropping him on the floor while staring directly at me. Evil!

After you get your picture taken, the cast member hands each person a mini Lightsaber that can go either red or blue depending on which side you are on. At the table, (which are little cars from the 50's) you get your menu and the server goes to get your pastry starter. A pastry tray, fruit, beverage, and entree are all included in one price. The [pastry tray](http://i.imgur.com/wBRwqgi.jpg) had chocolate muffins, puff pastry Lightsaber sticks with red or blue sugar, Darth Vader Danish things and Princess Leia sticky buns. All delicious!
The fruit salad or parfait that you get next has a little melon Yoda on the top. The entrees all have cute Star Wars names, but the only one that looks special are the [Vader waffles](http://i.imgur.com/QG1TZyu.jpg) which were amazingly delicious! I washed everything down with a blue milk (kinda blue raspberry flavored). The cast member who checked us in at our hotel mentioned we could keep ordering as many entrees as we wanted, but we found that one entree was plenty of food.

The screen at Sci Fi was playing Star Wars clips the entire time and whenever the cantina band music came on, the jawas and Stormtroopers all danced. [I traded with the Jawas](http://i.imgur.com/3VKH1zS.jpg] (they swindled me!), convinced the [Storm Troopers](http://i.imgur.com/yAGUrPJ.jpg) we were not the diners they were looking for, and [apologized to Greedo](http://i.imgur.com/qBpxvVp.jpg) for the incident in Mos Eisley so he would take a picture with me. When we left, Boba Fett almost followed me out the door to make sure I left. All in all, it was an amazing experience that I am so glad we were able to do. 




 Lol thank you :) I had a lot of comments on my ears (which came from etsy) so lots of people liked them! 




 I traded a rubber Darth Vader keychain and got a pink usb cable in return. My boyfriend said mostly what he saw in the trade bag was candy. 




 It really was! Have a nice time. 




 That's right, it only goes partway through June.

 Thanks! That's too bad :( 




 Wow it really does O.O 




 Good luck bud. :( 




 Thank you :3 




 I know right? Great value! 




 A USB cable would, but not the AC adapter. 




 Haha yes I did! I've been looting for about a year now. :3 Thanks! 




 Glad to help!  




 I love having the shoulder strap. I think the case looks great too. I might have to get some patches or something to brighten it up some. I just like color! 




 I would think so. That case looks really similar to the one I have on mine in the photos attached to my review. 




 [Here's my review, thank you!](http://www.amazon.com/review/R1948J6WYDGGS0/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm) 




 Hey if you remember [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/3DS/comments/3474zi/10_free_new_3ds_xl_cases_in_exchange_for_honest/) post from a few days ago about the case, you might be interested in my review of the product [here](http://www.amazon.com/review/R1948J6WYDGGS0/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm)

I really recommend the case! :D 




 Oh snap there will be OVER 9000 pokemon to finish the dex! 




 Yes that is the face tracker. 




 /u/Trollabot test_subject9096 




 I have a TN screen one. It doesn't bother me. Mine is black and I got it about five weeks ago. 




 I think so too. IDK why neckbeards insist on downvoting. XD 




 Gimmefreestuffers are everywhere on the internet. 




 [This case perhaps? Looks nice OP!](http://www.amazon.com/TakeCase-Carrying-Accessories-Protect-Nintendo-Guarantee/dp/B00UG63VDG/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top?ie=UTF8) 




 Pokemon black looks like crap blown up so I play it on the smaller resolution. 




 I always turn off my nn3dsxl before I insert or remove a game card. Do you not have to do this anymore? :O 




 It has a C-Stick, yes. 




 My New 3ds XL has a TN top screen. 




 As stated above I used metallic temporary tattoos I found on Amazon and sealed it with base coat nail polish. 




 I know right? I realize of course that it's fairly harmless but that doesn't mean I can't feel a lil creepy. 




 Yeah I should do that. 




 Yeah I never considered the possibility and my Mii is pretty recognizable. 
























 That article is really interesting! Thanks for all your comments. I understand much better now. :) 




 Or SNES for that matter I suppose.

Thanks!

ETA- Thanks for all the insight everyone! I have a much better understanding now. :3 




 FUCK YOU OLLY 




 NICE getting Mario and Luigi when I get home. :3 




 This looks like the game I want. :D 




 Yeah there is one for the university I work at. It seems to be geared towards students but maybe they would see me. I've been trying to figure out how to make an appointment without using the phone but I guess I'll just have to call them tomorrow. Thank you for your insight 




 The only medical person I have a relationship with is my OBGYN. Never got a GP since I moved here. : Gotta take care of the ladybits tho... 




 Nah. We didn't see bodies did we? 




 Which makes them main characters then, right? 




 DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG HE CARRIED THAT WATCH? EVER SINCE NAM, AND IT WAS NOT IN A PLEASANT ORIFICE. 




 ... really? 




 Crying for you ;-; 




 Uwaaaah that Ekans chu. 0-0 




 Black NN3DSXL, Blue DSi, Pink DS Lite, Cobalt GBA SP, Arctic Purple GBA, Yellow GBC. All still working just fine. :3 




 Her hair and clothes burnt off and she was entrapped in fire to the point where everyone thought she was dead. That was how I as a reader interpreted it. 




 ADWD Chapter 52 disagrees. 




 I feel like someone as attentive to detail as you would really get a lot out of reading the novels. 




 Ew. That sounds mighty unpleasant.  




 Daario.  




 The only reason the Chief ever lost a round of darts. 




 Oh that's a great suggestion. And thank you I will!  




 I was totally going to get them that until my bro said they were not going to Dublin. That failure prompted me to ask here. :) 




 He suffers from Gout. This is mentioned a couple times in S4, but not really made a big deal of like it is in the books. I bet lots of people were wondering. 




 White Walkers probably can't freeze the ocean but [ADWD](#b "wights can SWIM"). 




 Those are some great ideas! :D
 




 They will be in the southwestern part of Ireland for 13 days starting about August 5th. 




 Getting info from my bro is like pulling teeth but they aren't planning on going to Dublin apparently. :( Thanks for taking the time to make a recommendation and they definitely sound like awesome things to do! 




 Thank you that sounds awesome (to me, but then I like tourist trap stuff ehehe). I'm definitely considering that. 




 Hey that sounds fun! Thanks! :D 




 They are flying into Shannon and want to visit castles and such in the Southwest area. 




 Thanks! Will do. 




 My brother is getting married in a couple months and he and his fiancee are honeymooning in Ireland.

They have asked for wedding presents to be monetary contributions to their trip.

I'd like to keep to their wishes, but in a way that will make my gift be more memorable and meaningful than an amount of money going into a pool. I'm looking for museum tickets or special excursion passes that I can pre-purchase for them and give to them at the wedding. 

Please share recommendations! Thank you! 

Also I have been informed they intend to stick to the southwestern parts of the country to see greenspace and castles. 




 Wow! Glad you're doing better! 




 I'm sorry to hear that. :( Hopefully my body will! I have never tried anything but combination pills before so here's hoping. 




 Good news! Thanks. :) 




 I suffer anxiety too. It's never as bad as we think it's going to be and always better if you come clean sooner.  




 Thanks 




 LSH? 




 Oh no ;_; 




 Definitely! 




 He told me I had to make extra sure to take the pill at the same time each day.

He switched me because my blood pressure was a little higher than it was a year ago when I was first prescribed the pill. 

Thanks!

(Also how bout those new guidelines saying get a pap every three years if you're over 26? Heck yesssssss) 




 Pokemon Conquest maybe. I never hear anybody talk about it and it's so much fun. 

Also, Pokemon Ranger.  




 They didn't have to build campfires. Ramsey did that for them. 




 Well probably that it was sooooo up close and larger than life and she was riding it. That's what I thought at least. 




 Stannis' face in that show was that of a broken and desperate man. I knew right away what he was going to do. 




 Didn't he and Jorah glimpse a dragon briefly when they sailed through Valyria? 




 I'm guessing it has something to do with LP size records first coming out in 1948. That probably made it easier to distribute songs for home listening, like say at a holiday party. 




 He's a person and his name is Chewbacca. 




 It's my new favorite movie. I thought it was incredibly inspirational and one of the most creative movies in a very long time. 




 I mainly research Civil War POWs, and there were a few anecdotes in this podcast that stuck with me.

1. German POWs in Aliceville had so much food they buried the extra to get rid of it

2. American officials treated the German POWs so well because they feared retaliatory treatment of American POWs (but then continued after they discovered how American POWs were really treated).

It's amazing how 80 years, a World War, and an important treaty changed ideas towards POWs in this country. For those interested in reading a modern historical perspective on POWs in the American Civil War, I recommend [While in the Hands of The Enemy](http://www.amazon.com/While-Hands-Enemy-Conflicting-Dimensions/dp/0807130613). It's very critical of both sides and their treatment of POWs.  




 My Japanese DS games (Jump, Taiko) play on my NN3DSXL. 




 37 




 I think that looks awesome! 




 That would be so 90's throwback, especially in clear light purple. :D 




 If you go to the game in the Eshop and click repair, that may fix it. It did for me. 




 It's beautiful inside and the meal (lunch) we had was delicious. :) It made me happy to be there!

 A really nice metal tool box is an AWESOME gift for an archaeologist. I love mine. 3 




 [I always recommend Death by Theory](http://www.amazon.com/Death-Theory-Tale-Mystery-Archaeological/dp/0759119589)

It is a great way to introduce yourself to archaeological theory and how attitudes about it changed over time. It's also a quirky mystery novel! 




 Aww yay anthropology :) This was my first post in this sub!
