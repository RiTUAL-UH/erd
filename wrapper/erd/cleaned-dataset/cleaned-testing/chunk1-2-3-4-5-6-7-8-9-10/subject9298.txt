 I don't understand why so many women feel like they need to make a baby. Everyone wants to experience pregnancy. 
Why the fuck would you want to go through that kind of pain? Stretch marks, weight gain, all kinds of complications during the pregnancy, and then of course, labour. Not to mention, raising a newborn is a pain in the ass. 
Yeah, I'd rather adopt.
For me at least, I really couldn't care less if my child looks like me or not. I feel like a much better person knowing that I'm going to hopefully be giving some child's a better life rather than making another useless human to take up more space. 
























 My grandpas both died before I was born, but my little brother talks about them all the time. Apparently, he goes to his grandpas house and does all kinds of cools things, and sometimes he cries because he misses his grandpa. 
























 Lots to do. Can't do it.

 Sometimes I sit down and re-watch a few episodes of Avatar: The Last Air Bender, just to feel nostalgic.  
























 My dad was in the living room. I walked right past him and then slipped quietly out the door. Three hours later, at about 4:30am, I walked back into the house and passed my dad again. He looked at me and said, "Hey, you going to bed now?". 
It was then that I learned that my parents really don't give a shit. 
























 I used to believe that my mom would actually cut my pinkie off if I broke my pinkie promise.  
























 I have a really good memory and I'm great at understanding concepts really quickly, making school the simplest shit ever. But I'm too lazy to actually try 
























 Futurama is my six year old brother's favorite show to watch, which makes me happy because I've been watching it since I was around his age too 
























 I'll try that, thank you. Sounds like exactly the kind of thing I need 




 The biggest problem is actually building up the courage to even try.  




 I didn't hear anything so I have no idea, but there were definitely a crazy amount of emergency vehicles running around right afterwards  




 My mom just came in, talking about how she thought she heard fireworks. A few minutes later, all kinds of emergency sirens were sounding from all directions. Did anybody see anything? 




 Ren and Stimpy scared the shit out of me as a little kid.
