 You really don't want to fake it. If you feel you absolutely have to, you have to be careful so you don't get caught in a lie. But really, it's best to use your real experiences and just make it sound good. You can tweak small things. But don't ever put a job you didn't do! There are ways to find out if you actually did it or not. 

By honors I just mean academic awards/achievements. Like does you school have an honor roll (distinction for making good grades)? 

Those skills are a good start. Employers tend to want people who are excellent communicators and being able to speak multiple languages is a plus. 

You can definitely include sports, especially if sports are really all you have. If you did get most improve award, that could show you can learn new skills quickly and effectively. 

Think about the skills sports have taught you and how you can apply them to the work force. Were you punctual to all practices? Are you a team player / do you work well in a group? Did you learn excellent time management skills (having to balance sports with academics)? Are you dedicated / do you have a strong work ethic? Were you ever a leader - did you ever effectively communicate between all your team members? Did you ever have to solve conflicts amongst team members? Are you used to working under pressure? Can you work with all types of people? If any of these things apply to you, put them on your resume. Employers are looking for these things - they want to see that you can work with people, that you can solve conflicts, and that you are reliable.

 It's been a year since I studied conditioning, but I believe an unconditioned response can be replaced by a conditioned response. An unconditioned response cannot be created. Instead, it is a reflexive response elicited by a stimulus without learning. For example, whenever dogs see food, they salivate. The salivation in response to seeing food is a reflexive response, thus making it an unconditioned response. 

Now, a conditioned response is a learned response, and that can be changed or unlearned. In /u/tossedidiot's example, before the experiment the girl probably responded to the bunny with either indifference or by wanting to pet it - this is an unconditioned response. But then experimenters added a loud noise (a neutral stimulus) which would make the girl cry. Pairing the loud noise with the bunny made the girl learn to cry whenever she saw the bunny. The crying is now a conditioned response (NOT an unconditioned response). In this instance, the conditioned response COULD have be unlearned if the experimenter's were to repeatedly present the bunny without the loud noise OR they could use positive reinforcement (such as giving the girl candy whenever she went near the bunny or whatever).

**TL;DR** An unconditioned response is a reflexive response to something, but it can be changed in that a conditioned response replaces it.

 Ah, resumes. What fun! My husband graduated from college in May and I helped him with his resume. I took a class that helps with finding jobs, so I'll post some tidbits from a handout I received. 

**TL;DR** - Objective is 1-2 sentences; Use standard fonts like Times New Roman or Arial; Include information that pertains specifically to the position for which you're applying (don't put in useless information just to "fill" your resume); Describe activities in terms of results and accomplishments; Show you're a "doer" by using action words such as "accomplished", "initiated", "established", etc when describing your activities; Make sure your resume format is consistent; Read the job description/advertisement for the job and use any words the employer used to describe the job; Grammar and spell check!; You can put a "spin" on things to make yourself sound better, but never ever ever EVER lie on your resume. 

**The Objective**
The objective is a concise, one- or two-sentence statement that appears as the first major section of 
your resume. It communicates two things: what sort of job you are seeking, and what skills you have to offer. 
There are many different approaches to writing a job or career objective. Most styles focus on elements such as 
the position, the field, or the job-seekers particular skills. You may also choose to create an objective that is 
made up of a combination of those elements. Your objective may be oriented to: 
* The position  for example, A position as a social worker providing services for the aged. 
* The field  for example, Desire a position in the social service field working with youth. 
* Your skills  for example, A position utilizing counseling, research, and proposal-writing skills. 
* A combination  for example, Seeking a position as a public relations officer in a medical facility. Wish 
to utilize skills in communications, needs analysis, and photography. 

Another option is to write an objective that states both a starting position and a long-range goal. Therefore, your objective may be written to focus on: 
*Results  for example, A sales position utilizing strong organizational skills and the ability to work on a 
self-directed basis, where I can develop a sales territory and generate new business. 
*A long-range goal  for example, To secure a management trainee position with a large department store 
with eventual goal of becoming a store manager. 

**Font   Format**
Font choices should be classic: Arial, Times New Roman, or Tahoma are traditional, professional, and easy-to read. Font size should range between 10- and 12-point, with the only exception being your name, which is usually written a few points larger. Bolding, italics, underlining, and all-caps can be used effectively to emphasize headings and create a visual break between information. There is no prescribed way of making these choices, but be consistent.

When printing your resume, use high-quality stock paper of at least 20-pound weight that is available at most print shops and office supply stores. Conservative white, off-white, tan or light gray are generally acceptable colors.

Your resume should be crisp and clean looking, and visually appealing to the reader. Use white space effectively. Avoid cramming and crowding. Use spacing to accentuate sections 
and headings

Normally a one-page resume will be sufficient. In virtually no instance should your resume exceed 
two pages. Make sure your descriptions of your work experience and/or extracurricular activities are results-oriented. Describe activities in terms of results and accomplishments.

Make revisions, and make sure there aren't mistakes.

**Experience**
Don't worry if you've had limited or no experience. By customizing your resume, you can present your accomplishments and experiences in an effective way in  relation to the position for which you are applying. If you have difficulty expanding upon your work experience, or are concerned your jobs werent glamorous or relevant, the following may be helpful: 
* First, describe your responsibilities using action words such as created, planned, analyzed, or 
initiated. Show you are a doer. You can probably find a list of words online, or I have one if you want it.
*Next, think about the transferable skills you gained from each experience. Examples of transferable skills 
include oral or written communication, interpersonal skills, working effectively in a team, leadership, and 
research or analytical skills. They are transferable because you build on them and carry them with you as 
you move from job to job. Employers often value these abilities as much as, if not more than, technical skills. 
* Finally, ask yourself which of your job duties and accomplishments will matter most to the employers you 
will be pursuing, and place those most prominently on the work experience portion of your resume. For each 
job, develop (typically) two to four phrases or sentences, using your lists of action words and transferable 
skills, which describe your key responsibilities and achievements. 
* You will also benefit from considering the description or advertisement for the job to which you are applying. 
Look for keywords that the employer uses to describe the skills and qualifications being sought for the position. Identify overlap between skills you possess and skills the employer is seeking, and be sure to emphasize those phrases and keywords in your resume.

Remember to include any honors you've received.

 I still have hope that we will see LSH on the show, and let me explain why.

Did anyone watch How I Met Your Mother? While the show was still on air, fans had a theory that the mother was dead the whole time. Then in an interview the actress who played the mother debunked that theory, saying it was just a ridiculous conspiracy theory created by fans and that the mother is not dead. Guess what fucking happened on the last episode? So, the actress lied about the show's ending!

What is the moral of this story? Trust no one. People who are involved with making shows lie all the time to throw off fans. Thus, I hope they haven't officially decided to not include LSH.

Edit: Stupid autocorrect. 




 My school's English club has had the same issue as you. Our member involvement has been very low. Last semester, we seriously only had about 5 active members. I know one reason why we've had low involvement is because very few people know we exist, and even fewer know what we even do. So first and foremost, I would say promote your club as much as possible! Hang up posters, ask professors in the English department to inform their students about the club, go where students hang out the most and hand out flyers, or even have tshirts made and have members wear them.

At my college, people love volunteering. I would considering finding a way to get your club involved with volunteer activities. For instance, last semester my club did a book drive. First, we had people bring in old books they didn't use any more, then we sold them for pretty cheap (anywhere from $.25 to $1 each) on campus. We raised about $500 and all proceeds went to our local children's hospital so they could buy books for their library. You could do some sort of fundraising event for local organizations that promote literacy. 

Another thing you could do just for fun is a book swap. I know people want to read books, but books are expensive to buy or they just can't find something good to read. So you could throw a small party or something and have people bring old books they don't want and they can swap books with other people. 

People love contests and prizes. You could hold writing competitions. My group is planning on holding a campus wide poetry contest and the winner will get something like a small gift card to a local restaurant or bookstore or something. So hold flash fiction contests, poetry contests, things like that and give away small prizes.

Our club also has it's own publication, a literary magazine which accepts and publishes the best analytical essays. We were able to get a grant to help with the costs of printing and whatnot since it's professional, but I guess you could do the printing and stuff on your own if you want to do it on a smaller scale. We accept submissions from late fall through early spring and publish the magazine late spring. Once submissions are closed, we read through everything and pick the best, then we do light editing (spelling and grammar). You could consider starting something like this, and you can publish any type or writing (creative or academic) you want. If you guys like creative writing, you could put together a magazine of poetry, fiction, creative nonfiction, novel excerpts, etc. People at my school love this. The group in charge gets to act as editors and students get their work published, both of which look good on resumes.

Hold open mic events. Invite people to come and read poetry or an excerpt from a short story they've written. Make sure to have popcorn or pizza to draw people in, or you could ask to hold the event at a local coffee house. 

Do you have a local company that puts on plays? We have a local Shakespeare company, and every year we get together as a group and see a play. 

People love free stuff, so offer free pizza or any free food or whatever at meetings.

That's all I can think of for now. In short, promote your club as much as possible and offer free stuff. Good luck!

As the title says, my parents called today to say they had to put our dog down. Sammie was 16; he would've been 17 in October. His health had been pretty poor for years now (he was blind and couldn't hear or walk well), but he was one strong pup. 

My parents gave him to me as a Christmas present when I was 5 years old. Today, I'm 22, married, and about to graduate college, so this dog has been around for a lot of major events in my life. It's like my childhood officially died with him. 

[A few pictures of Sammie.](http://imgur.com/a/0VvC0)

You were the first dog I ever had, Sam-Sam. Thank you for all the memories, for being a loyal companion, for teaching me responsibility, and for making me feel like I always had a friend. I am going to miss you.

Edit: Spelling 




 Thanks. I wasn't sure which place would be better... Perhaps I'll move over there.

 /u/sympathyboner is right about seeing the doctor and possibly getting a new pill.

I had a very similar experience with Lo Loestrin. I would have light breakthrough bleeding ALL THE TIME and I would miss my periods. My doctor changed my pill to Generess Fe a few months ago and everything is back to normal.

Also, since you mentioned that you were stressed, keep in mind that stress can screw up your period.

I hope all is well :) 




 "Irregardless" drives me insane. It's "regardless" you illiterate swine! 









 One day while playing Skyrim I traveled to the house where my family was living and my [adopted son was walking around in his underwear](http://i.imgur.com/mdPdVIp.jpg)

Edit: Sorry for potato quality, btw. 
























 I was a very laid back bride for the most part. I didn't care what anyone did as long as it wasn't drastic. My bridesmaid got a nose piercing before my wedding, but I didn't care because she offered to find a way to conceal it for the wedding (and she did). My sister cut her hair and dyed it a couple weeks before the wedding, and again I didn't care because it wasn't anything that would cause a distraction.

HOWEVER. The day of my wedding, my mother in law showed up with her hair dyed fire red. She flat out admitted she did it the night before the wedding. When we first saw each other that day, I was in my dress, waiting for pre wedding photos to start. She walked up to me and without even acknowledging how I looked in my dress she said "How do you like my hair?!" I was FURIOUS simply because she didn't ask if it was okay and because it was a HUGE change and therefore a huge distraction - EVERYONE was talking about it at the wedding. Whenever I look at the wedding photos that anger returns. She stands out the most in all the photos. Her hair looked absolutely awful with the wedding colors, including her dress color. 

The point of this is: don't do anything that will distract from and/or upset the bride. It is, after all, her and her future husband's day. She only gets to be a bride once, so don't let anything upset her. So, if you're sister is not okay with it, wait until after the wedding to make changes to your hair.  




 I really wish I had some advice for you :( I am  terribly sorry. But thank you for the warning. My husband purchased my engagement ring from Kay's in 2011. I was considering taking it to them sometime soon since the white gold has faded, but I definitely will not do that now. 

Also, I've read horror stories in which people take their rings to Kay's to be repaired and upon return they received fake rings or diamonds. If you do get your ring back, I would check to make sure everything is legit. 

Again, I'm sorry this happened to you, and I hope you get some sort of compensation. I would love an update in the future.  




 My husband and I ate dinner at Tony's while on our honeymoon last summer. If you're looking for something romantic yet casual I would recommend it. We got a picture of us almost kissing while eating the same piece of spaghetti like they did in Lady and the Tramp. We're are so cheesy! 




 I am living in Kentucky, attending a state university, can confirm that they can be god awful...

Despite my parents telling me I should choose an inexpensive Kentucky college, I chose to attend a pretty expensive university in Ohio and found the debt wasn't worth it for what I was studying (English and education).  Even with a large scholarship, it was fucking expensive. Also, all the professors and employees (such as in the financial aid office) and even some of the students were snooty and unfriendly. So, I switched to a school in Kentucky and found their program isn't too terrible. I was skeptical about switching to this KY school because I had heard people had so many issue with it: wayyyyy too many students, financial aid is fucking useless, parking sucks dick since it's a commuter school, there's favoritism, and some other random things (shit gets lost or mixed up by people in the bursar and registrar offices all the time it seems)... But I didn't find any of these issues to be that big of a problem. The professors in my department are AMAZING. It seems most professor through the university (not just in my own department of English) are pretty good. However, there are some, mostly those who are adjuncts teaching lower level courses or core university courses, are god awful and just don't give a shit. Also, a lot of the students are...well...idiots, and I honestly have no clue how they made it to college (one girl in my class thought Australia is in Europe...). But overall I'm happy with my decision to switch from a prestigious out of state school to a not-so-prestigious in state school. 

You should base your decision partly on what you plan on doing in the future. If you want a career that won't make a whole ton of money, you obviously don't want a lot of debt... That's one of the reasons why I transferred to my local Kentucky school. The Ohio school cost $30,000 a year (I, fortunately, after scholarships only had to pay $10,000). However, I was originally going to school for teaching which only makes $30k a year!

TL;DR: The Kentucky schools are hit or miss. People either love them or hate them (and it also depends on the school... I know people from every big KY school, so I can tell you what people have said about them). Think about your expected salary after college when picking the college...

Edit: Remember that if you stay in Kentucky, you'll get KEEs money if you're eligible... Free money right off the bat just for staying within the state! That's always a plus. 

And one Kentucky college I would recommend looking into is Murray State. My husband absolutely loved it there. It's not shitty like other state colleges.  




 As someone else has noted, this is nepotism. We had this happen in my university's English club before. The only way we fixed it was when new board members, who recognized that there has been problems with nepotism in the past, came to be in "power." We decided that all future board members have to run a campaign and be elected by other student members - so our club president doesn't appoint board members, as your club seems to do. We also have a professor who oversees everything, and she now has the power to remove people from office and appoint new people if things aren't working out. 

Does your club have a professor (or some other university official) who has authority over the club? I don't know if this is possible, but if there are enough complaints, is it possible to "impeach" the club president and have new elections?

It's up to you whether or not you want to do something about it. In my opinion, it's not right when people who don't deserve positions get them. Then again, the world isn't always fair, and you're going to encounter situations like this in the "real world" too, not just in college.

Edit: spelling 




 I am so terribly sorry you are being dragged through this situation. It sounds like your wife has issues, but has trouble figuring out what they are. All I can say, like many others, is counseling. I truly hope everything works out for the best.  




 Im sorry, I wasn't trying to speak of it lightly - didn't mean to make kids sound disposable like a puppy or something because kids are serious business. There are some people not meant to have kids, I know that. I'm just asking OP if his wife has ever seriously considered kids and if she has given a legitimate reason for not wanting kids... I mean, it sounds like she would try to take care of a child if she had one by accident so why doesn't she want to have a baby purposely? I'm also curious as to how she hates children since she, as OP claims, has had a limited experience with them (and what is this limited experience, and did the limited experience play a role in her not wanting kids?). I also feel that she's making an excuse when she says she doesn't want kids because she doesn't have maternal instincts since some women, at least as I've seen, can have the instinct kick in once they have a child of their own. I just want to know if there's a hidden reason why she doesn't want kids: saying she hates kids, especially when she doesn't have experience with them, sounds like a sketchy reason to me, but that's just me. 

In short, I want to know why the wife won't keep an open mind about kids, why she's so adamant on not wanting them when she hasn't had much experience. 

Sorry if I made it sound like she should just have one and pray to god she doesn't hate it because I wasn't trying to say that... 

Edit: rearranged things... 




 Just something I am curious about... You say that your wife has barely been around kids, yet she hates them. How can she absolutely hate kids if she hasn't has much experience with them? What about kids does she hate? Does she hate the idea of having to raise a child? Or does she hate how annoying they can be? Could it be that she hates kids because she's only been around other people's unruly or misbehaved children (meaning she's only seen the negative side of children/raising children)? 

Also, I know women who once absolutely hated kids and felt they had no maternal instinct whatsoever, but once they had kids of their own they love them as any parent would love their child. Sometimes maternal instincts doesn't kick in until you have your own child. So, you can hate children, but it seems people have different attitudes toward kids when it's their own child. I loathe other people's children at times - you know, children whose parents allow them to scream nonstop or run around and be all annoying - at times I worry I won't be able to able kids either. I also hate how gross they can be and worry I won't be able to handle diapers and whatnot... but at the same time, I feel my maternal instincts will be stronger when I have a kid of my own, making me a good mom. Plus, I also know my husband will be extremely supportive and will be a wonderful father.  

Has your wife ever taking that into consideration? That her maternal instincts will kick in once she has a child, and you'll both be wonderful parents?

 Two words: pocket pussy... 




 Wow! I am insanely jealous. I am happy they waived it  




 I'm terribly sorry you feel the way you do about your body. I would agree that a therapist is your best bet. Are there no services that offer any type of free counseling in your area?  I agree you probably have body dysmorphia - definitely search the internet and read about it. There are online support groups you can join, or you could just read through people's advice on how to overcome this. 

I am 5'9" and I weigh 140 and sometimes I feel overweight as well. But let me tell you what I'm beginning to learn: being skinny is overrated. At your height and weight, you're not overweight; you're probably curvy like I am. Some men (and women too!) absolutely love curves - they're quite sexy. You have to learn somehow to embrace your body, love it. Honestly though, if you're curvy, and not just skin and bones, that's a good sign that you're healthy, and that's what's most important. 

Also, you've overcome anorexia? Wow! I'm sure that was tough. That's something to be extremely proud of. That shows that you are strong and capable of getting better. 

I wish you the best of luck in feeling better with yourself. Be positive. And find some support from people who know what you're going through. 

Edit: spelling and whatnot.  




 As one user has said, colleges tend to care about the money. Often, they don't have souls and don't care about people. My husband took classes over the summer at a local community college a few years back, and he went to the registrar office and asked to have the classes dropped before the deadline. He assumed everything was fine. Then he got a notice saying he owed the school money. Apparently somehow his classes didn't get dropped - his paperwork got lost, so there was no proof he had dropped his classes on time. We were in financial hardship then (and trying to afford a wedding as well). Long story short, regardless of our hardship, he had to pay the school back in full. 

Meanwhile, I was attending a very expensive Catholic university. Despite having scholarships and loans, I didn't have enough to cover the cost so my parents paid $5000 out of pocket every semester. My grandmother died suddenly, sending my mom in a deep depression that caused her to stop attending work, which caused my parents to have a lot of money issues. My dad and I filed paperwork to get more loans or some sort of assistance from the university. They denied it. 

I'm sorry if this discourages you, but like I said, many universities just don't care. 

So here's my advice: try like hell to get the school to understand you are in hardship. Be polite and truthful, and do not accuse the college of being evil or anything. Tears could be beneficial. Maybe you'll get lucky and they will care. Be prepared for the worst though. If you have to pay the money back, try for a loan. Whoever said you should calculate how much those 3.5 hours of class time costs has a good idea, that sounds fair to me, hopefully they could go for that... 

Also, take this situation as a life lesson. Be sure you always know what you're getting yourself into, and always know and meet deadlines.

 My husband and I went to DQ last summer and most of the games   rides were broke... Would not recommend. 




 For some crazy reason, my first thought was "Oh, so Daario is Jon's penis?" 




 The high school I graduated from visits first graders every year and gives them "class of" shirts... No idea why.  




 Here is my two cents. Do not be afraid to talk to your girlfriend about things like this.  Don't be afraid to ask "What do you think about me getting you a promise ring?" I don't understand why men propose without ever seriously talking to their girlfriend about it first.  I guess men want the girl to be surprised, which is great, but you need to make sure that the girlfriend is on the same page and wants the same things. The girl can drop hints about wanting it, but that's not talking about it. 

Also, don't worry if it's "too soon." If you feel the time is right, then the time is right. My husband and I got engaged four months after we had first met and only three months of dating. I was 19, he was 20, we were both sophomores in college. My husband and I talked about getting engaged after only a month of dating. We talked about it, then talked some more, then talked even more. We talked the subject to death, making sure we were always on the same page - and we always were! When we got engaged, we got a lot of shit about it being too soon and everyone said we wouldn't last. We remained engaged for two years before we got married and now we are very happily married. 

So, don't let anyone tell you it's too soon. No one can tell if you the time is right except you and your girlfriend. So before you decide to take a step forward in your relationship, have a very serious conversation with your girlfriend, and do it only if you both decide it is the right move.

 Have you talked to your professor at all?

My husband was in the same position as you last semester. He was all set to graduate, but he could not for the life of him pass any of his tests in his language course. He had to get a decent grade on his final just to pass - he was averaging 50s on the tests and he needed close to a 75 or something on the final. In the final weeks, he asked his professor for help as much as possible, tried to show he cared about the class and was really trying but just couldn't grasp the content. He also told her that he needed to pass this course to graduate and that he had a job lined up after graduation, which obviously he would lose if he didn't graduate. He studied hard for the final, but he was confident that he failed. However, two days before graduation his professor emailed him and said he had just barely passed the class and he was graduating. I have no clue what he actually scored on his final, but he likes to think that talking to his professor is what helped. She actually was willing to work with him - she offered extra credit and was willing to drop his lowest test grade to see if it would help. 

So, if you haven't talked to your professor, I would highly recommend it. Seek all the help you can get. Best of luck.  




 I am in the same boat. I sometimes feel extremely nauseous in the mornings. I also have terrible stomach pains. The main thing that helps is having a bowel movement and my doctor prescribed Zofran for the nausea. If I don't have a BM or don't take the medicine, the pain and nausea just go away after being awake for a couple hours. 

I would definitely try exercise to see if it helps. I tend to feel better when I'm standing up and moving around.  




 We did this as well. For sex we came up with "taking the beef bus to tuna town." 




 This. Exactly this.

I don't understand why you want/need your parents' permission to return home. You're an adult now, you are free to make your own choices. If you feel so strongly about returning to your hometown, support yourself. Get your own place. If you can't afford to do this own your own, find roommates to help split the cost of rent.

It was so unexpected. My grandpa was absolutely dumbfounded.  
























 I've never heard of that before. Perhaps I'll look into it.  




 I have IBS-C, and I get really bad cramps and when I "go" it's just awful. I spent a lot of days in the hospital as a kid because I would get so backed up and impacted. I, too, have described the pain like giving birth. In fact, I often joke that child birth should be a breeze for me considering I've been dealing with this pain all my life. 

The fact that you have black stool is a bit concerning. It could be something as simple as something in your diet, but it could indicate something serious if there is blood in your stool. You could have an irritable bowel disorder such as Crohn's. 

You should definitely see a doctor, particularly a gastroenterologist. I know it can be embarrassing and scary - I used to have the same feelings. I would always lie to my primary doctor about my bowel troubles because I didn't want to deal with it. This led to a shitty (ha, pun not intended...) childhood - I didn't go to sleepovers, hang out with friends much, or really date anyone because of my problems. I kept myself sheltered. However, with some support, I finally buckled down and finally saw a specialist. Mentally, I feel so much better knowing I have a diagnoses - someone affirmed that I wasn't just making my stomach issues up. Physically, I feel better because I'm having less flares, and now I have more control over my life since I'm not always having bowel issues. 

So, yeah, definitely recommend going to a doctor. Hopefully /r/IBS will give you the support you need. 

I wish you well :) 




 ...and I put the coat on her! 




 That's what I thought... Highly frowned upon at least.  




 Wow, thank you very much. I am trying to be more proactive, and I refuse to give up this time. I have started a migraine log and I'm trying to be as thorough as possible. Thanks again for your input. I'll try searching for other (and hopefully better) doctors.  




 I went to a doctor about a month after my concussion, and she told me my headaches were from taking too much medicine and not from the accident. She refused to put me on anything. I was only taking Advil a couple times of week, if that . 




 He didn't offer any free samples, just told me to try my mom's first. It was so weird. My husband about lost it when he said pregnancy was a treatment lol. 

This guy is supposed to be a migraine specialist. People gave him good reviews on HealthGrade, but he just seemed a bit whacky to me.

I must admit that I was not very prepared for the appointment. I randomly decided to make this appointment one day, and when I called they said "oh, we had a cancellation so we can get you in tomorrow morning!" which means I had less than 24 hours to prepare. I'll definitely be more prepared next time. 

Thank you so much for your input.  




 This was the first time I've ever seen this neurologist. I haven't had much treatment in the past - I've only ever been prescribed two types of preventatives and the Relpax. 

And no, I've never thought about that option before... What exactly is a neuropsychologist?  




 I've lived in Kentucky my whole life, I don't know how to properly pronounce Louisville, and at this point I'm too afraid to ask.  




 I have an INFJ personality type, which is supposedly less than 1% of the population.  




 [Yoo-hoo, big summer blowout](http://youtu.be/lpzvS0ATxB4)

Btw, I am extremely ashamed this is the first thing that came to my mind.  




 Fack - Eminem. I like Eminem, but this is quite possibly one of the most ridiculous songs to ever be recorded.

 I tried changing my password to GameofThrones but the error told me it contains too many dead characters.  




 Damn. Now I wish I would've sent him one of our Marauder's Map wedding invites. Needless to say I'm so jealous! Congratulations!!!! 




 The lyrics for "By the Way" by the Red Hot Chili Peppers are "con job, boot strap." The first time I heard the song it sounded like he said "Cunt job, boob cat."  




 It's never stated for sure who that's supposed to be. However, if you google search Professor Aurora Sinstra this picture shows up. Additionally, according to Harry Potter Wikipedia, Sinistra has dark skin. It seems a lot of people believe it's her.  




 Michael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth. 

Edit: also, Heath Ledger as the Joker.

 Congrats on the upcoming nuptials. My husband and I went to Disney for our honeymoon in 2013. It was a great experience. I'm not a Disney expert like a lot of people here, but I'll put forth what I know from both my honeymoon and my research for our upcoming trip. 

We also decided to move to a Universal Hotel. We ended up just getting a cab, and I think it cost us $40 to get from Port Orleans to the Crowne Plaza on Universal Blvd. It cost the same amount to get to the airport from the Crowne Plaza. Not trying to keep you from switching hotels, but I'd like to mention that I was severely disappointed we didn't stay at the Disney hotel the entire time. I hated having to repack and move all of our stuff halfway through the honeymoon. Also, I really hated dealing with transportation to the airport when we could've just taken the Magical Express to the airport for free if we had just stayed at Disney. But that's just me; I'm sure others don't mind switching hotels, and I'm sure there are better deals for cabs than what we got. 

We went to DisneyQuest about two hours before it closed, when tickets were half price. Even then it was not worth it. Most of the games were broken. The Buzz Lightyear Astro Blaster is awesome, but we waited in line for a half hour...then it broke down. The roller coaster simulator is amazing, but I think - and correct me if I'm wrong - they have something similar at Epcot. So, overall, I would urge you to stay away from DQ and spend your money elsewhere. 

I would also suggest reconsidering Planet Hollywood. The food really isn't that great. 

Downtown Disney is a hit or miss for people. It's a lot of shops and restaurants mainly. They also have Cirque du Soleil, a movie theater, and a bowling alley. I love going there, but for me it's not somewhere I spend my entire day - just the evening for dinner and light shopping. The Lego Store is awesome for bringing out the kid in your. Check out the House of Blues if you're into music. And if you're chocolate and/or dessert lovers, try Ghirardelli. Two words: free samples. I have read DD can be nightmarish with the current construction but I don't know much about that - perhaps people who've been recently can comment on that. 

Have you looked into the Boardwalk? I've never been but I'm hoping to check it out when I go in May. It's similar to DD, but I have heard its quieter. It has Jellyrolls - a dueling piano bar - and Atlantic Dance Hall, both of which is 21+ and open until about 2am. 

Be prepared for a lot of attention! People saw our buttons and congratulated us. The driver on the Magical Express announced our marriage. When we met characters, the handlers made a big deal out of the fact we were newlyweds. I know some restaurants will do something special if they know it's your honeymoon. They made our table a little more romantic at Tony's - it was sweet. My husband and I got super super super cheesy and we got a pick of us eating the same strand of spaghetti like they do in Lady and the Tramp. 

Have you looked into the horse drawn carriage rides? I believe both Port Orleans and Fort Wilderness offer them. They're romantic and relaxing. If you end up going to Downtown Disney, you could take the boat to Port Orleans and do the carriage ride there. 

Look at websites with crowd calendars. I'm not certain which site is the best, maybe someone can suggest one, but I think easywdw.com is good. Crowd calendars break down which parks will be most or least crowded east day and basically suggests which day to go to each park. In general, steer clear of MK on Mondays (though I'm a hypocrite for saying that, I'm heading to MK on a Monday because my birthday is on Monday and I'll be dammed if I let a Monday stop me from visiting the park on my birthday!) 




 My husband and I will be at Pop Century at the same time! This will be our second trip together. I hope your first trip is magical! 




 I didn't even think about that... God damn you, Kev!!! 




 It's first grade! 




 We have way too much time on our hands when the show isn't on. Is it April yet? 




 He looks awful with blonde hair and absolutely sexy with dark hair. But he naturally has red hair! Crazy.  




 Yep, midnight EST 




 I love you! 




 Well then, thank you for helping my parents keep their jobs (both work for the post office) :) 




 I just booked Be Our Guest for my birthday lunch in May. I'm really, really, really, really hoping I can get in for dinner instead though! 




 Stay, with Ewan McGregor and Ryan Gosling.  




 A few days ago, a house exploded due to a gas leak near where I live. The house was blown to pieces, shockwaves felt for miles. Two people were inside, both lived without major injuries. After seeing this, I have no idea how they lived let alone walked away practically unscathed. 




 I can stand to watch almost anything. But the hair trap scene in Saw IV? Nope.  




 I thought I was the only one who does this. I started doing this hard blinking voluntary twitch thing a few years ago. I thought maybe it was a side effect of a medicine I was one - it seemed to start about the same time I started new meds - but after stopping the meds the hard blinks never went away. I also have bad anxiety so I've also thought it could be a coping mechanism for that too. I feel tension around my eyes and it only goes away when I hard blink. I've mentioned the twitch to doctors and they've never heard of anyone else doing this, so I quit bringing it up during appointments. Even though it is partly voluntary I can't seem to stop doing it.  




 The actors definitely were much too old, but it's never been a huge deal for me. I've been a fan for about 13 years and I only just realized that Snape, Remus, Peter and Sirius were only in the 30s. How it took me so long to realize that is beyond me; I guess the movies just made me "see" the characters as older while reading the books.

God damn you, seventh grade English.  




 One thing that struck me as odd is that you list your GPA as a 3.90 but you graduated cum laude... If you graduated with a 3.90 shouldn't that mean you would have graduated summa cum laude, not cum laude? Sorry if I'm incorrect. 




 The commercials are giving me too many feels. I didn't want to go on a feel trip today.  





























 I just started reading the first book and I'm already halfway through it... Can't wait to finish so I know what you're talking about!!! Ah!

Update: I JUST FINISHED THE BOOK. HOLY SHIT. 




 Is that a "That wasn't a fart!" expression?

Congratulations. She's absolutely beautiful! 




 True, but she got into a lifeboat for a second time (the one Cal and Jack put her on) and got off of that one too! If she would've stayed on that second lifeboat, maybe Jack would've had a chance.  




 Yay!! We got ours in the mail today. We are leaving May 9th, and I'll be turning 23 while we are there :) 




 I'm not a professor, but I had the same professor for 5 classes and I know something that always drives him mad. This professor teaches creative writing courses, and every week people turn in rough drafts of their work for the class and professor to critique. Far too often someone says things along the lines of "I finished this right before class" or "I completely forgot my work was due until the last minute, luckily I was able to whip something together." They say these things to fellow classmates and most importantly to the professor. Oh man my professor abhors it. He is extremely passionate about his classes and about writing. Whenever students say stuff like that he takes it as they didn't care about their writing or the class, and it makes him feel like they are wasting his time. I mean, it takes hours to critique the works for each week (for my novel writing class each manuscript was like 20+ pages long) so I totally understand why he is so upset when students act like they didn't care about it, and so blatantly admit that they don't care.  




 Yay! Congrats! 




 Just keep checking! I've heard that people double book and then cancel one of the reservations when they make a final decision.  People will probably cancel as the date gets closer. After obsessively checking for weeks, I managed to pick up a BOG dinner reservation for May 11 about a week or so ago.  




 For some reason, I'm thinking Liam. I really wish Sammi would die though.  




 We have "Better Call Paul!" billboards here in Northern Kentucky. I've been meaning to get a pic of one for weeks.  




 I cannot wait to prank my husband with this in May.  




 Yay!!!! I'm glad it's not completely impossible to get a reservation lol.  




 Hi all!

My husband and I are going to be in Magic Kingdom on May 11 to celebrate my birthday. We didn't get to experience BoG on our honeymoon, so we're going to this time around. When we booked our vacation, all that was left were lunch reservations, so I got in at 1:15pm. However, I wanted to see if I could get in for dinner because I kind of want my birthday dinner to be sit down and not quick service. I've been stalking the reservation site, but for weeks I've been getting the "Sorry, no reservations are available blah blah blah" message. Imagine my surprised today when TWO reservations appeared! One at 4:05 and one at 8:55. I nabbed the 4:05 time. Now I can't decide if I want to keep the lunch or dinner reservation (we don't we to do both at BoG in one day because that's way too pricey; our second meal will be a quick service, most likely Pecos Bill)

I've been weighing the pros and cons of each. I really like the idea of lunch being cheaper, but I like the dinner options a bit more and I really want to try to meet the Beast. I cannot decide, so I've decide to ask the experts. Those who have experienced BoG, which do you like better - lunch or dinner?  




 Just the white Red Heart Super Saver - nothing fancy since I was just practicing. 




 I am still relatively new to crocheting, but I decided to try my hand at a dress last week (I told my husband we can't start trying for a baby until I am a pro at making baby clothes haha). I found a relatively simple pattern that uses just double crochets and shells (2dc ch 2 2dc in same stitch). [Here is the link to the pattern](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/angel-wings-pinafore) on ravelry. Also, [here](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/e9/61/5c/e9615ca1910a65cfe58bbe0055b227f7.jpg) is a super cute dress that someone on Pinterest made using the same pattern. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/FyuhyTu.jpg) is my final version - I didn't try to gauge it or anything since I was just seeing if I could following the pattern (I'm still learning how to read patterns, but it came out alright. I used Red Heart. 




 I really hope it's not Morgan, and I've been trying to find reasons to believe it isn't. In an interview Robert Kirkman said it would be a huge misstep on their part if Morgan didn't meet up with the group at some point (though he refuses to confirm if he ever does). Also, last December, Scott Gimple said, "People want to follow that character; I want to follow that character. There's a Morgan story to tell. It's the beginning of something, but I'm not going to say what it is, or how involved it is." There hasn't been much of a story for Morgan's character so far, so hopefully they didn't just screw with fans and just killed him off.  




 They did it! They did the thing with the window!! Ahhhhhh!!!! 




 I hate to admit that you are be right and there may be new deaths... However, didn't they dig graves for Lori, T-Dog, and Carol (who they thought was dead) at the prison even though there weren't any remains to bury? If so, then that means two of those graves could still be for Noah and Aiden despite not having their bodies.  
























 [I don't know why, but this GIF instantly came to my mind](http://i.imgur.com/7IgWM.gif). 




 If Bronn dies, we riot.  




 I'm not sure if this belongs here... The actor who plays Edmure - Tobias Menzies - recently did an interview, which begins with him talking about GoT and his hope that they eventually tie up Edmure's storyline. I found it funny that he is just as clueless as the fans. [Here's the link](http://www.vulture.com/2015/05/outlander-tobias-menzies-on-going-full-frontal.html) to the interview for those interested.  




 Go Rand! Make Kentucky proud. 

Anyone have a count on how many times Sen. Wyden said "my colleague"?  




 My university is the same way. Graduation is usually on Saturday, grades aren't due until the Tuesday after.  




 I'm a day late to the party, but [I'll leave this picture here anyway](http://i.imgur.com/rYf60RB.jpg). 




 Currently at Pop Century, and yes there is a fridge but no microwave. If you decide not to use Garden Grocer, you could look into shipping items to the hotel. Like order online from Walmart or some other store and instead of shipping the items to your home, ship to the hotel. We ordered water and some breakfast bars from Amazon Pantry and shipped them to Pop - they accepted the package four days before our arrival without any problems and we picked it up at the front desk when we checked in.  




 I am now going to call the black end on a banana "butt nugget." 




 Touch. 




 Isn't birth control [supposed to be free under Obamacare?](http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/5888320) 




 Random question. I was just looking on the Disney app for wait times at Epcot. It says the wait time for Test Track is 300 minutes, or 5 hours... Pretty sure it was just a crazy error. Does that happen often on the app? 




 I hope you had a safe and wonderful flight! Have a great trip! So far Pop Century is awesome.  




 Woo hoo!! T-minus 24 hours until we board our plane :) 




 I just started packing today! Saturday can't get here soon enough! 









 Thank you! :) 




 Check out [this](https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/plan/my-disney-experience/bands-cards/) page over on the Disney website. That should answer your questions!

Basically, if you're not staying at a Disney resort, you'll receive a card instead and you'll have the option to buy a MagicBand online or at Disney World. If you are staying at a Disney resort, you will receive a MagicBand free. To customize your band, sign into your Disney account and under My Disney Experience you'll see "Magic Bands and Card" ([here's a link to it if you have an account](https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/plan/bands-cards/)). There, you'll be able to customize your band - there are various colors including pink. According to the Disney website, you have until 10 days before your arrival to customize your band if you want it shipped to your home. If you don't customize your band before then, you'll pick it up at your hotel. 




 Arriving May 9th, staying at Pop Century (my phone autocorrected to Poo Century... Really, phone?). Anyway, I can't wait! I'll be celebrating my birthday on Monday :) 
























 Are your in laws really going to be with you for 15 hours a day every day for a week? That seems like a bit much! A lot of people in this sub seem to suggest that visitors never visit for more than an hour at a time since new moms are exhausted and trying to learn how to parent. You shouldn't have to entertain your in laws all day soon after giving birth. If they stay in a hotel, they will have somewhere else to go if you ever want quiet, rest, moments of privacy, or are just plain tired of guests.  




 Hi all! I've been lurking /r/tryingforababy and /r/BabyBumps for ages, but I've always been disappointed because I don't belong to either. Needless to say, I'm glad this sub exists!

I'm 23 and hubby is 24. We have been together for almost 4 years and in August we will celebrate our 2nd anniversary. Over the years, I've realized that I want nothing more than to be a mom, maybe even a stay at home mom. I obsess over all things parenting - I'm constantly "pinning" things on Pinterest, reading articles about parenting, and I love reading people's experiences over on BabyBumps and BeyondtheBump. However, we haven't found the right time to TTC yet. DH and I both graduated college last year and we are in student debt up to our eyeballs. We are currently living in a crappy, moldy apartment and desperately want out. We currently don't have nearly as much money as we'd like to have before starting a family.

Luckily, DH got an amazing job right out of college, and he's already received a promotion and a nice raise. We are working hard to stick to a budget so we can be in a good place financially. After years of being incredible stupid with money, we finally got our shit together and got ourselves completely out of credit card debt. So all we have in terms of debt is student loans. We're currently focusing on saving money for a house since we NEED to get out of this apartment. Hubby calculates that we can have enough money for a good payment as early as January 2016. Currently, that's the only thing holding us back from TTC. I want a house first or at least be a little closer to buying because (1) I do not want to deal with the stress of moving while pregnant or with a newborn and (2) I do not want to raise a baby in this tiny, moldy apartment. 

Anyway, I decided to introduce myself finally thanks to the "Is anyone else not working  amp;amp; trying to find purpose?" thread that was posted the other day. I've been feeling that way for a long, long time. I haven't been working since graduating college due to some minor yet annoying health problems - I suffer from frequent migraines and I'm still trying to get them under control. I know that my purpose in life is to raise a family, and not having kids absolutely kills me. I can't find anyone who understands because everyone tells me that kids are awful or that I'm still young and have plenty of time to have them, and that maybe I should work so I'm not "bored." Ugh. I'm glad I found people who finally understand how I feel.

So anyway... Hello! 




 Aww, yay! Happy anniversary. Here's to hoping your stay at TryingForABaby is a short one :) 




 [This baby bird grown as shit](http://m.imgur.com/gallery/X4MTZbu).  




 I'm just a lowly lurker here... But I thought I would pop in and say the books are amazing. I'm only on book 3 of the series though. I absolutely love reading books with such a strong female protagonist.  




 I absolutely love the scarves Claire wears on the show, but haven't gotten around to making one. Beautiful! I'm jealous.  




 Shame 




 I agree with /u/SageOfTheWise, but I also think more than anything he is just praising the work of Tobias Menzies. Tobias is amazing on Outlander, and GRRM probably wants him to bring his talent back to GoT. He joked that he's jealous Outlander has more air time then GoT, so maybe GRRM is also a little jealous Outlander currently has Tobias's talent?  




 It's a race to see which will be released first: this or Winds of Winter. My bet is on this... 




 Stannis is about to lose his father of the year award.

Edit: aaaannnd it's gone.  




 Wow I see a few from Xavier. Go Muskies! :) 




 You are correct. My husband is in the financial field and just explained this to me a couple days ago. You cannot contribute more than you earn.  




 :) Were you there the same week as us? May 9-May 16 




 I was a little skeptical about staying there at first since it's a value resort - I feared it would have a cheap motel feel to it and would be too crowded. We stayed at French Quarter last time and I thought Pop wouldn't be as nice. I must say, I like Pop so much more. Despite being in a room on the first floor, it was fairly quiet (we were on an end in the middle of nowhere though so that might be why haha). The grounds were beautiful and the 50s pool was relaxing - a nice escape from the hustle and bustle of Disney. Absolutely amazing value. 









 This happened to us a few weeks ago, on May 15th. We had a fast pass for Space Mountain, but it kept shutting down throughout the day so I kept changing my fast pass for later and later. It ended up shutting down at like 7:00pm and never reopened. I went to change the fast pass on the Disney app and found that I had been given a fast pass I could use on any ride at any time. It was awesome. 




 "Well I don't want you to give him any grief about this, ya know, cause you could traumatize him and turn him into a serial killer or something."
"Well don't worry. How much damage could he do with only one free hand?" 




 Yeah but George RR Martin survives solely on the tears of fans. Diana does not. She cares about her fans' feelings haha.  
























 I'm in the same boat as you. My gynecologist stopped delivering babies a long, long time ago, so I'm searching for an OB. I've decided on the hospital where I want to deliver, and I've been searching for OBs that deliver there and accept my insurance. I've Googled some of the OBs and found reviews on other pregnancy message boards, which has been extremely useful. It seems highly recommended to not wait until you're pregnant to meet your new OB or midwife, so it's good you're starting your search early. Babycenter.com has a nice [list of questions to ask when searching for a midwife](http://assets.babycenter.com/ims/Content/Midwife_interview_sheet.pdf). 

Anyway... I believe you choose one or the other; you don't need both. There are practices out there that have both OBs and midwives though. You could also have a hospital birth with a midwife (there are so many damn options, aren't there?!). I found this information which is good to know:

Be aware that if you start out with a midwife and develop a problem down the road  such as premature labor or preeclampsia  or find out that you're having twins, your care will be transferred to an obstetrician or perinatologist. (Depending on your condition and the practitioners' arrangements, you may be able to have a midwife and a physician handle your care together, if you like.) 




 Best of luck. I found this little pre-interview pep talk that you might enjoy reading: [Link](http://i1123.photobucket.com/albums/l543/hercampusphoto/Lauren%20articles/career/peptalk.jpg). Confidence is key to a successful interview. I'm sure you'll rock it!

 




 Yep. The thought of him being an amazing dad is what originally gave me baby rabies. When I was first dating my husband, I was stalking his Facebook page and came across a post where he said his biggest dream is to be a dad. I think my ovaries exploded that day.  




 Except Monopoly almost always ends in rage quit...  




 So every B amp;N is participating?! Sounds so cool. I need to talk to people. My husband is getting pissed that I keep spoiling the books (currently on Voyager).  




 Are you and I the same person? I started a wish list about a week ago, spent 2 hours one night making it because I was so bored. I only ever talk about baby related stuff; I'm starting to worry if my husband things I'm insane. I'm always reading about how to raise kids and constant worry about being a good mom, which my husband claims is adorable and sweet. I have baby names picked out and often use these names when referring to our future kids (all names are husband approved). So far, I've crocheted 3 baby blankets and one dress in the last month or so and I'm itching to make more baby stuff. I have researched OBGYNs and already know where I want to deliver. I think I need an intervention. Please send help.  




 Fun fact: his costar on Masters of Sex played Janis Ian on Mean Girls.  




 Congrats on the marriage :) good luck! 




 I've had a pharmacist catch a potentially fatal drug interaction that my primary care physician completely missed when prescribing me medicine. Needless to say, I am thankful that pharmacists are so knowledgeable about drugs.  




 How are kids supposed to summon Satan if they don't know how to play Hot Cross Buns?! 




 I've spent the last two hours looking at stuff on Amazon and adding things to a wish list. This is all your fault haha.
 




 Aw, I'm glad I could help! Best of luck to the two of you.  




 I'm not early in a relationship, but I'm 23 and I was once in your shoes. I started dating my husband when I was 19 and he was 20. At first, I didn't have any urge to have a baby. However, after a month of dating we were already talking about our future; marriage and family and whatnot. I don't know what the hell happened, but one day I started thinking about babies and couldn't stop. I was so madly in love with him (still am, of course) and just could not wait to start a family with him. It hurt so bad knowing we weren't ready to have children, but it was true: we absolutely were not ready. For us, the timing was not right. We were only sophomores in college at the time, unwed, and barely had any money. Plus, my family could barely swallow the fact that we had gotten engaged after only dating for 3 months, they probably would've been disappointed if I had gotten pregnant. The thought of trying to juggle school and a kid on so little income without my family's full support terrified me. So, although we hated doing so, we were very careful to prevent pregnancy.

It's been almost 4 years since I first started dating my husband. I've obviously never stopped desiring to have a baby with him. Am I sad that we don't have a baby? Yes. Am I happy we didn't end up having one? Also yes. In the last 4 years, we got married, took advantages of opportunities while in college, graduated college with highest honors, and DH has gotten an amazing job and a promotion. We've been able to get out of credit card debt and now we are able to save money for a house. I know that everything we've done would've been so much more difficult and stressful with a baby, so even though I would love to have had a baby by now, I feel waiting was the best choice for us. Honestly, we kept ourselves busy, and these last 4 years have flown by. I can't believe we are so close to TTC. 

I've tried to not think about it so much by taking advantage of the time I have with my husband. One day it won't be just you and your SO anymore, so enjoy that time while you still got it. Also keep in mind that there probably won't be a time when you and SO will feel 100% ready for a baby; there isn't ever a perfect time to have one. When you accept that fact, you're "ready" for baby. 

Maybe you'll feel better if you and your SO have a nice talk about the future and set a time frame. If I didn't have a time frame for buying a house and TTC, I'd lose my mind. 

TL;DR: You're not alone. The waiting sucks, but at the same time, sometimes it's for the best, at least until you're more certain it's what you and SO want. Maybe set a time frame to give yourself something to look forward to, and keep your mind occupied so the baby rabies won't consume you. 




 "Take her to the moon for me, okay?"

God damn you, Bing Bong.  




 That's what I thought. Thank you! 









 My mother and sister both deal with endometriosis (not sure about fibroids, but it sounds familiar. I know Mom would always get cysts that had to be surgically removed though). Anyway, neither one had issues with getting pregnant. I hope this doesn't add any barriers for you.  




 And yet here we are, indefinitely, waiting on my husband's general feelings of not being ready.

If everyone waited until they feel 100% ready to have a baby, hardly anyone would have babies... 
























 It's good to hear someone returned to "normal" fairly quick!

The one thing I love about BC is that I don't get many period symptoms. I started BC because of terrible cramps. Definitely not looking forward to that again. Ugh! And why must PMS and early pregnancy be so damn similar?! 




 Thank you! I'll definitely check out the book.  




 I went with my husband in May. I was really nervous because I have bad social anxiety as well. We were seated in a corner where there were only two other tables. Our waiter, "Uncle" Dale, was amazing. He was a nice older gentleman. He didn't do anything that made me feel uncomfortable. He never called us out on anything, though we watched our elbows and we ended up eating everything. He commented on our huge appetites. The other two tables kept him busy - both of the other families had really intricate allergies so he spent a lot of time talking to them about food options. Anyway, he provided a really positive experience, no public humiliation whatsoever. I definitely think they can tell how much you want to participate.  




 This is the best comment.  




 Agreed. We put it back in a little longer after I took a pic because we realized the dough wasn't completely done 




 I'll have to ask my husband if he has the recipe 




 One thing that's really bothering me right now is when to go off birth control. I've been on the pill since I was 15, so about 8 years now. For most of that time I was on a pill where I would only have like 3 periods a year. Last year I switch to Generess Fe and started having periods every month for the first time in a long, long time. My brand was just recently switched to Layolis Fe.

I really want to go off BC because I want to start tracking my cycle. I don't know why, but I have a HUGE fear that my cycles won't be regular. I also think my BC is giving me acne - I started getting cystic acne when I switched pills last year, and my acne flares the same time every month (the second week on active pills, which seems odd?). I'm also curious if going off the pill will help my headaches. 

Obviously there are also reasons to stay on the pill though. For one, my prescription is free. I used to pay $25 a month, but as of a few months ago it's now free. If I go off the pill, we'd have to pay for condoms or we'd have to be super careful about preventing. Also, what if by some sheer luck get pregnant right away? I mean, I'd be super excited, but I'd really prefer to keep waiting until we're closing to having a house. 

Ugh. It's such a complicated decision!
 
So, how did you decide when to go off the pill? Are you waiting until you're ready to start trying? Or did you go off a bit early to start tracking? Also, is anyone willing to share their experience going off pill? 

Help me stop worrying about ovulating after going off the pill! 




 There's tomato buried somewhere under all that cheese... 









 Don't do it! I spent two hours on there one night just looking at baby items. It's addicting.  




  When has he ever been sickly and weak? Just because he lost a fight as a 15 year old boy to a 20 year old man? Because he's not built?
 

There is indication he was a small, weak, sickly boy. Littlefinger sees himself as a weak boy from a small family who ended up becoming powerful. Also, remember S4E8 when Littlefinger says "Sickly little boys sometimes become powerful men"? He wasn't just talking about Robin; he was referring to himself. 




 Mind absolutely blown. 




 Haha sorry I went overboard! I'm happy to help.  




 (oh crapthis ending up being SUPER FREAKING LONG. But I hope its somewhat useful)

Oh man, I love this topic! I cannot stop obsessing over finances. I've only been looking at the first year though, so many someone else can help with the rest. Oh, please keep in mind that Im not a financial person, Im just a normal woman who loves researching the shit out of finances. So take what I have to say with a grain of salt.

First off, stay away from personal finance. Some people there can be ruthless. I once saw a pregnant woman seek advice there for an unexpected baby and they all told her to get an abortion. WTF?

In 2010, the USDA estimated that the average middle-income family spends $12,000 in the first year of a baby's life. Yikes! But it's so tough to calculate the exact cost of a baby because it varies from person to person. 

[Here is a lovely baby cost calculator to help you figure out about how much you'll need for your baby's first year](http://www.babycenter.com/baby-cost-calculator).

I think one of the biggest reasons that number is so high is because of child care. It can be ridiculously expensive, and the younger the child the more expensive it is. For many people it seems most of their monthly income goes toward childcare. I've seen numbers as high as $2,000 a month (the fuck?!), but it depends on where you live. If you plan to use daycare, maybe look online, call around, or ask around to see what typical costs are in your specific area. Obviously, if you do not use daycare of whatever, you're going to save a ton of money right off the bat. 

The cost will also vary depending on whether you chose cloth diapers vs disposible. Someone over on BabyBumps just put together a [wonderful chart that compares the prices of diapers](http://i1265.photobucket.com/albums/jj513/elfer1/2015-07-14%2011_39_47-Diaper%20Comparison%20-%20Google%20Sheets_zpszpzwha9e.png). 

There are estimates out there on how many diapers a baby goes through the first year. [ToysRUs has a chart on their website](http://www.toysrus.com/shop/index.jsp?categoryId=10872434) that breaks down numbers. Estimates show you'll need about 2,788 disposible diapers for the first year, which costs about $550, based on paying an average of $.20 per diaper. For wipes, I've read it's best to buy bulk. People have suggested to never pay more than $.02 per individual wipe. 

I personally dont plan on cloth diapering, but it can save a TON. I have read that it costs about $381 to cloth diaper a child from birth to potty training. In comparison, it can cost $2,500 for disposable diapers from birth to potty training. Cloth diapering is especially useful if you plan on having more than one child. You buy all the cloth diapers for your first child and you can reuse the diapers for the second. [Here is a website that shows the price differences on cloth diapers]( http://www.diaperdecisions.com/pages/cost_of_cloth_diapers.php).

Formula... I cannot gauge prices on formula because it depends on what baby can tolerate. I've seen prices as cheap as $50 a month to formula feed, but I've also seen people pay ridiculous amounts (like $500 a month) because baby is allergic to things and needs a very special formula. Ugh. Breastfeeding can obviously save you a ton of money.


Hospital costs   doctors visits can be factors too I guess - will your insurance pay for most everything or are you going to have to foot a lot of the bill? Ive seen couples pay nothing out of pocket for the entire pregnancy + birth, and Ive seen couples pay $10,000 just for the birth. I recommend contacting your insurance in advance of pregnancy and see what all they cover so you know what you can expect to pay.

Then it depends what you want to buy for baby. Do you really have to buy all the toys for your baby? For some, an empty formula can will provide hours of entertainment and saves you money on toys. 

Does everything have to be brand new or are you okay with used and hand-me-downs? You can save a ton of money buying used. Some people buy things they end up not using and instead of returning them they just put the items on Craigslist or whatever  allowing you to buy things basically brand new at a much cheaper price. You know those mamaRoos that cost $200 brand new? You can find them on Craigslist almost brand new for under $100!


Anyway, the USDA says I'll spend $12,000 on our baby...but I'm calculating that we shouldn't need more than $5,000 for the first year (and even that sounds a bit high). The point is that the cost is different for every family. 




 You're not a downer. I didn't think about that before. Your comment is actually eye-opening and I like the brutal honesty. I know I need to work on actually making changes instead of just pushing through, and I'm honestly trying. I tried to get professional help in the past and it failed, which absolutely crushed me. I'm finally starting to find the courage again to try to learn how to actually overcome anxiety. 

In short, thank you for reminding me that "just pushing through" isn't enough. 




 I'm a long time lurker, never really introduced myself. I'm a 23-year-old female. I've been struggling with anxiety since my early teenage years, but it seems to have gotten worse since sustaining a concussion. Now a days it seems to manifest physically (headaches, neck pain, stomach pain/IBS, dizziness, lightheadedness, hot flashes, all that jazz). I am extremely on edge whenever I go out, so I like to hide away in my apartment, where I just sit around and dread my next social interaction.

Anyway... I currently volunteer with an animal rescue group by writing adoption biographies of the animals and posting them online, which in and of itself makes me nervous as hell. Last night though, the woman in charge forwarded an adoption application and asked me to contact the 3 references and interview them. Calling 3 strangers and actually talking to them? INSTANT PANIC!!! I've been dreading it for the last 12+ hours, but I finally forced myself to sit down and call the references. Happily, I executed the interviews without sounding like a complete idiot. 

I feel so stupid for being proud of myself for doing something as "simple" as calling people. More than anything, I'm proud that I'm finally trying to conquer my anxiety. This is a huge accomplishment.  




 Second this. I'm 23, been married for 2 years, still on parents insurance since it's currently the best option.  




 DH bet me yesterday that I can't go a whole day without talking about babies. It's not going so well :( 




 Congrats!

 I have chronic daily headaches and get migraines as well. I also have terrible anxiety. Magnesium seems to help people with migraines, depression, and anxiety so I've added a magnesium supplement to my diet. I feel like my headaches are less severe now a days. It could possibly help with bipolar disorder too. Maybe ask your doctor if it's worth a try.  




 How exciting! My college professor is a contributing writer. 




 Today, DH and I were texting while he was at work. Out of the blue, he sent me a link to a gun he was looking at (no surprise; he's always looking at guns or hunting stuff). In reply, I sent him a picture of [this onesie](http://i.imgur.com/sJPHyk8.jpg) one of the local hospitals is giving to babies born during the MLB All Star Week. Guess which one of us has baby rabies?
