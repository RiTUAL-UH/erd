 What if you're sitting on on right before the spikes pop up. Ouch 




 First of all... Those are counterfiet gummy bears. Disappointing

 Why does Sheldon look like a zombie 




 God dammit OP  




 Someone wrap him up and send him to my house.  




 Frobama 




 We must get Obama to say "Michelle, WHERE IS MY SUPERSUIT."  




 Twist; OP is a karmawhore 




 Faith in OP; restored
 




 Rape face 




 Matrix 




 Scooby looks high as fuck 




 TL;DR. I'd still think it's ironic  




 Adorable! 




 Well? Did she call? 




 Sweet bowl bro 




 Bro. Spiders are fucking scary 




 I'm so sorry, Toby looks like a sweetheart. 3  




 I was gonna upvote because you said to downvote, but alas, I have realized your tricks. Downvote for you sir

 Has Reddit seriously become Facebook?

 http://i.imgur.com/j5ZYK.gif 




 this is like when people post pictures like "step one: like this page. step two: comment the number 1 step three: watch what happens to the picture!" and there are ~1K comments only with the number 1.  




 TL;DR  




 repost.  




 oh my god. if you're gonna repost, at least wait A DAY before reposting. *cringe*  




 Thank you :) 




 This has always bugged the shit out of me. Inform me of your logic. So... nobody can have a bf/gf... ever?  




 r/pokemon with posts about Pokemon???? Shocking 




 It's funny how everyone is talking about this except for the fans themselves.  




 Goddammit Helen, pull yourself together 




 Thanks, Obama  




 Which episode is this ?  




 /r/ladyboners ;)  




 Am I the only one that knows this is repost? 
























 That's about the 4th repost I've seen today. And I've only been on here for about 10 minutes.  




 Your life must be so awesome 




 If I had a penny for every time I've heard or seen this phrase on reddit I'd probably have 14 cents. 




 Just as I thought OP was a cool guy 




 What has reddit become...  




 Fucking hell reddit, grow up! You all sound like a bunch if 12 year olds... When did it come to this 




 To be fair, OP never said the turtle was alive...  




 Stupid people piss me off 




 The fact that you claim it's yours when it clearly isn't makes me more mad than it probably should. 




 Would you rather I have a username such as "childrapist4004"  




 You're an awful boyfriend.  









 Why so much One Direction on reddit? 




 Repost 




 Galaxy * 




 Kill yourself  




 You mean.. there are other ways? 




 Repost. OP, you are a fag 




 you mean find this kids parents. 




 Happened to me way too many times...  




 What is this? A screenshot for ants?  









 I just saw this on my news feed and KNEW it would make its way to reddit. It's the little victories... 





























 Reminds me of the Emma Stone .gif 




 no you didn't.  









 Haha suicide jokes! Grow up 




 Where did he ever say he wanted them "off the Internet" I believe you're talking about Beyonce. 




 Alright bring on the downvotes, I'm just so fucking tired of people believing everything they see or hear on the Internet. He wasn't 2 hours late, it was 40 minutes. He didn't "insist on playing video games" when he woke up either. And even if he did, he's fucking human for fucks sake. I'm tired of seeing everything this guy does on here, if I wanted 24/7 Bieber coverage I'd join twitter. Get your fucking facts straight and stop posting about Bieber.

 That isn't funy at all. The girl in this picture in Jamie Foxx's disabled sister. What the fuck OP
 




 That reminds me, I should start my lab report. Thanks 




 you're * 




 Texting? Not likely. Playing a game on his parents phone so he won't be a bother? Most likely. 




 1) not real
2) repost
3) grammar

fuck you, OP  




 This isn't Tumblr. who is upvoting this? 




 If you don't want to watch it... then don't. I'm assuming nobody's going to force you to?  




 I lol'd 




 ^birthday 




 "double tap if you're on Instagram" ... seriously? 




 said the liar 




 all aboard the gold train. next stop: who knows.. 




 All my friends like 9Gag, its just me and another really socially awkward guy who are the only redditors in all my classes.  




 SECOND most dangerous ;)

 "My son" no OP, burn in hell 




 This dog looks like you did more to it than just yelling...  
























 You guys don't actually believe this do you...? 




 r/cringepics 




 Get out of here you bloody brown bastard! (read with Indian accent) 




 #just#me#in#my#room#2deep4u#swag#yolo 




 Will you be my swag 5ever? 




 Just like when the police went to my buddy's house because they didn't know his address. 




 TIL 




 I have kind if a similar story. The whole family went with me to the shelter to pick out a cat and one of them came up to us and just jumped into the baby stroller. I'd like to think she adopted us :)  




 Small town in Switzerland here... everything closes at 5 and nothing is open on Sundays. Consider yourself lucky. 




 Wow awesome. Thanks for this OP 




 They're reminders 




 Great post, thank you http://i.imgur.com/AQXhkNw.jpg 




 Wonderful cat, thank you

 Ahoy! 




 Proud of myself for still not having seen this. 




 I feel like shit knowing I missed this :( 




 I really don't understand this. How the fuck is your sexual preference interfering the way you play?  




 this gave me cancer 




 OP you're a fag 




 Could not agree more. I'm turly sorry for your loss man. Self medicating is not the answer. I think you just need someone you can talk to. Stay strong bro.  




 To clarify, that isn't me. 




 My hands just got sweaty. 




 You know it's gonna be a bad day when you've seen something on Twitter before Reddit.  
























 I posted this a while ago ... :/ 




 Nice repost, faggot. 




 Irony 




 that is awesome dude nice job 




 All you are is mean. 




 Reddit must love Bieber 




 Thought I was in /r/cringepics  




 Ugh not this fake gif again.  




 Most celebs have a blue verified check next to their name. 




 Oh really? I thought that was actually what it was saying, thanks!  









 Leave your wife, she deserves someone better you piece of shit 




 fake, reposted, trolling in the title. seriously ?  




 Demi Lovato? 









 Just waitin' for a mate 




 Karma 




 So glad i'm not the only one ..  




 Better than my "friend" who blames the illuminati...  




 yes , call her Jules aw i love that name. 




 Because everything on the internet is true. 




 I suppose you know this because you were there? 




 This is the exact meme my maths prof. has hung up in class... I suspect a possible redditor. 




 It isn't 
























 Yes because only MEN know math.  




 Pete Wentz?  




 fuck you mean "younger"  




 what a small world... that's my picture...  




 Mamrie Hart !!!  




 it was actually my information she was giving out... this is so good to hear. oh my god. (at least I think, a while back I got into an argument on tumblr with a SJW and they started giving out my info and it lead to a whole thing, police and everything) 




 Then I fill the tub up halfway then ride it with my surfboard surfbort, surfbort 




 She's also just made a movie, which came out yesterday called Camp Takota :) 









 All hail the glow cloud 




 Self respect isnt about rather or not you show your breasts, its about being comfortable with your choices. If you want to pose topless, thats okay. If you dont, thats okay too. Whats not okay is saying youre better than someone else because you choose one way and they chose another.
Telling women that they should be ashamed for choosing something that doesnt hurt them or others (and by hurt them, I mean like choosing to do drugs or something like that), you are contributing to the patriarchy and oppression 




 "To be fair, I think canned tuna is unsafe for cats unless you wash it thoroughly." - Chreiya 




 Such bullshit OP go fuck yourself 




 [F]emale 




 As a gay woman, I feel your pain 




 TIL "rigged" means voted according to the rules.  




 Lil Bub !  




 If I only I didn't have so much shit to wrap :(  









 I love the way your eyes pop out! Beautiful :) 




 Who the fuck upvotes this garbage? 




 It's been a year and I still don't get this meme 




 It's a fucking baby what did you expect.  




 I can so see this becoming a children's book.  
























 I really loved the book Forgive Me Leonard Peacock, anyone know anything similar?  




 As a teenage girl w/ clinical depression, I loved the movie. I actually found it the opposite of "triggering" in that I could really relate to it. 

Then again, it's different for anyone, maybe have her watch the trailer?  









 My brother too! And me! All hail the gay agenda!  




 When my grandma passed a few years ago, I would call her cell everyday hoping she'd pick up.  









 Smh 









 Just browsing r/all on mobile, haven't looked at this sub any further; I will tonight though  




 Wow that is amazing, you look great! Keep up the good work 




 I just took the test and got 94% for Bernie. I'll be honest I didn't know anything about him or his policies before this so thanks!  









 I hadn't, thanks OP 




 I'm so sorry for your loss.  




 I love how the title to 83% of posts in BPT are "white" translations of the image [7]  




 oh my god I love this  




 I was there last year too, spent 2 weeks in a hospital. Unfortunately I hadn't started smoking regularly yet so I can't imagine how great that first hit must have felt... keep your chin up! I'm always here if you need someone to talk to or anything Like that :)  




 where's my ring? 




 oh my god all of my teachers are wearing "keep calm and keystone on" shirts this week
