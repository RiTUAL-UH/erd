 Yeah I think it was captioned something like that but I thought it just seemed a bit random in comparison to the rest of the documentary. Wasn't sure if it was actually a younger family member or something.

Still, wish I was taken under Jack White's wing when I was that age!

 I did half-GOMAD about a year or so ago and it definitely did work. The biggest problem is trying to adapt to a normal diet afterwards - milk doesn't really stretch your stomach that much and I found that I actually lost weight when I tried to switch back to solid foods as I couldn't eat as many solid calories.

 Although I'm just a beginner I did read a paragraph on this in a gourmet shaving book today, the author said if a brush is still doing this after 1-2 weeks you should contact the seller. 




 I definitely will, I couldn't believe how generous it was! I want to shave 10 times tonight so I can try it all out! 




 He wrote a note that said "exceptionally cold" as well haha! Your warning has been heeded! 




 I just got given a sample of this but I'm totally new to shaving properly, should I be excited?? 









 Goodbye xbox live membership! 
























 Hi there,

Sounds like you're definitely experiencing some anxiety in your situation, perhaps a bit of depression aswell. I'm not a professional though so don't take my word on that.

It sounds like you're going through a really difficult situation right now and I'm not surprised that you're having these feelings - in fact it's probably quite a normal response. The problem seems to be that these feelings of anxiety aren't serving their purpose of motivating you, and have got so severe that they're having a negative impact on your life.

I imagine you haven't had any previous input from professionals as you mention that you've not felt like this before, but there are plenty of techniques you can use to help combat these feelings ranging from the professional route to the self-help route.

Perhaps the first thing you should consider is meditation, you'll be amazed at how quickly this can make you feel physically calmer (within minutes!) and there are loads of online guides that will help you get started. It's very difficult at first but it will at least be a first step of making you aware of how busy your mind is and hopefully help you identify the negative thoughts that are making you feel this way.

I hope this is a helpful starting point and please message me if I can help in any way! 




 I find they're really helpful. All of the unpleasant feelings that you have at the moment are based on what is going to happen in the future. If you practice meditation or mindfulness you can start to focus yourself to be in the moment, and speaking from experience this is a huge release. It helps you release that at any moment you can get away for these horrible feelings if you need to.

Do you have a smart phone? There's an app I could recommend, if not I can have a quick look for some online sources 




 Okay well that's a good start. TV is great at taking you out of the moment and helping you focus on other things. Have you considered trying meditation or mindfulness at all? 




 Being a person is the hardest thing you'll ever do, I've been in some pretty dark places, but it's also the best thing.

First things first, have you tried any coping mechanisms already? 




 I know that feeling, it's nice to stay in a comfortable, safe place after experiencing anxiety for a while. I think that doing this will only serve to increase your anxiety in the long run though. 

You've got to keep pushing yourself to leave that comfort zone and you'll get back to normal soon enough. Try and force yourself to go to the gym today, PM me when you've done it to keep yourself accountable :)

You're not alone with these feelings and they're definitely possible to overcome!

 I have a horrible feeling this is a cropped scene from The Walking Dead. 




 Brothers, sisters, thank you for showing me the whey 

Although I am but a few steps down the iron path, it has been well trodden by those who have worshipped before me. I have seen that whilst the path is treacherous, all those that walk it with devotion in their hearts are rewarded.

Today I gazed into the mirror and with great joy saw my first blessing - I beheld not a boy, but a man!

Now all that remains is to visit my temple and give thanks.

 Alas, you have paid the price for being tempted by Broki. But fear not, although the path may now be somewhat longer, it is laid out before you still.

 Hi everyone,

Tonight I am going to be Table Topics master for my local toastmasters meeting. I have come up with a seasonal theme for this and am feeling well prepared on that front, however I am unsure how to introduce table topics to the group, particularly if there are any new members.

Does anybody have any advice or key topics I should address when introducing this portion of the meeting? Any help would be greatly appreciated as I am still awaiting my Leadership manual - it is being shipped to the UK so is taking a long time to arrive.

Thanks in advance! 




 Glad to see this at the top, the very fact that the quote starts with the word "but" is a red flag.  




 Thank God you're here, to the top with you!  




 I always jerk off when I'm tired, helps me sleep. 




 I don't think anyone in the thread has said it was intentional, at least I don't think anyone was being serious.

I hope... 




 At my local club we do the CRC method - commendation, recommendation, commendation. Gives the speaker an area to improve in but sandwiches it between praise so they're motivated to do it again. 




 Last night our topics master had some pretty good ones that she actually used with her Primary School class at the start of year for ice-breaking. 

The questions we had were "If you could have any super power, what would it be?", "If you could speak another language, which would you choose and why?", "If you won the lottery, what would you spend it on?" and "Who (living or dead) would be at your dream dinner party?".

They were really fun topics to discuss and quite suitable for beginners too as they're all quite light-hearted. 




 Hey Alison_Hendrix,

I'm in a very similar position at the moment, just started a Masters degree and it scared the shit out of my when I first got here. I also used to be an overachiever and have found it a bit of a shock how much harder I have to work here!

Turning 22 is a scary age, I couldn't agree more. Everyone says your life will start to fall into place at this age but I can vouch for it not being that simple. You do have to work hard for what you want to achieve, but you CAN do it.

Take a step back from your situation at this very moment and try to stay calm. You're probably using these past couple of months to define who you are at this point in your life, and convincing yourself that you're a person who panics and can't get things done. Try to think of your life in the context of who you were before that as well. You've achieved so much already and with just a little bit of hard work you can achieve everything that you want.

Don't get too hung up on the past, focus on what you need to do in this very moment to succeed. 

Oh, and try meditation! 
























 The thing that I find interesting about atheism is that generally they don't believe in an all-powerful God. What if God isn't all-powerful? Perhaps there is some form of higher-dimensional being who is trying to help life survive in the same way that we humans try to make plants grow etc.

In my eyes it's not God vs No God. There are a lot more possibilities than that.

 Hey I get health anxiety too! Hit me up if you want to talk :) 




 I can't believe it either. It looks so simple and not like exercise at all but I definitely felt it in my upper neck! 




 I don't quite have the same problem as you, but I do have trouble with speaking a little too quickly. To be honest the best fix for me is that I now live with several foreign people, every time they mishear what I say it's a reminder that I need to speak more clearly. 

I'd suggest doing something similar. Every time someone in day to day life asks you to repeat what you said, use this as a reminder that you should be speaking more clearly.

 Was the peanut butter one just people mixing up jif and skippy in their heads?

Nah, probably just a higher dimensional peanut butter. 




 You make a good point about evaluations, I feel that people miss a golden opportunity to improve every time they are given a bad evaluation. Does your club use general feedback slips for each speaker? 




 That's an interesting concept and would definitely help you learn how to give a perfect speech. But personally I'm not sure if that prepares people for the real world where they will likely just give their speech once. There's also a risk of over-preparing a speech and making it sound less natural. I'd perhaps suggest repeated a speech once but no more. Maybe even giving it again in the same meeting after some feedback. 




 Ah that's something used at our club as well! It's nice to get a variety of feedback, especially on the occasions when you have an evaluator who's scared to give constructive criticism. 




 If you feel ready for it, volunteer as Toastmaster. We had a new toastmaster at my meeting the other week and he added in a couple of new elements which helped keep things fresh and interesting.

 I'd be interested to hear your views on this question as I think that whilst toastmasters has been incredibly valuable to me, there are a couple of areas in which it is lacking. I won't suggest anything yet though, I'd love to hear your unbiased answers! 




 If I remember correctly, is this the crash that circulated really quickly online and brought twitter into the limelight? 




 Hi Jstbcool

First of all, thanks for your incredibly well structured and thought out response. It's rare to see that on the internet!

I'm surprised I missed the effect sizes and it's definitely something that we need to be aware of, you make a very good point. In fact one of the things that stood out for me in this paper is the fact that they computed their required sample size a-priori in terms of power. It's refreshing to see people embracing the "new statistics".

I didn't mean to suggest that the participants played 8 hours of luminosity straight. However, having participated in a lot of Psychology experiments myself I felt I could speculate pretty accurately as to which of the two trials would be more tiring. Portal 2 is likely to be much more engaging and most importantly, fun. I think this would affect participants attitudes towards the testing as a whole, particularly with regards to motivation. Motivation is something we take for granted in Psychology a lot and I would hazard a guess that it will have had an effect even in the testing phase.

My third point stems from the reading I've done into the effects of nutrition on cognition. Nutrition is a pretty fascinating subject because there are huge pitfalls in a lot of the research and these are often worsened once cognitive testing is brought into the mix. It's not uncommon in this field of research for a cognitive benefit to be apparent on the day of testing, but to have disappeared once tested again a few weeks later. But, in defence of this study, it is a good starting point for further research to explore longer term effects. 

If this study can be replicated, it'd be interesting in the future to work out exactly what aspects of Portal 2 are causing the cognitive benefit. It's extremely difficult to break down the components of such a complicated game, especially as it wasn't designed to be a brain training device. I get the impression that dedicated brain-training games are simple because developers attempt to make them evidence-based. By jumping in with Portal 2 we've almost worked in the opposite direction; we have a game that may cause a cognitive benefit, but we have no idea what the mechanics are which make this happen. 




 There seem to be a ton of problems with this article and I highly doubt that there's really been any effect at all.

To name a few:

- When carrying out this many statistical tests you are almost guaranteed to get a couple of Type 1 errors (finding an effect when there isn't one). P values in this study were only reported to the extent of p  0.05 which gives no indication of what the actual p value is. With the 11 tests that they're carrying out in this study we'd want to carry out a Bonferonni correction and divide the significance level by 11 (0.05/11= 0.0045). 

- 8 hours of lumosity is going to cause a lot more cognitive tiring than 8 hours of portal. Lumosity is just not engaging enough to play for this amount of time. I highly doubt the participants were motivated to actually do the cognitive tests after all of the practice. 

- There is no follow up on these tests so we can't tell whether any effects (if they really exist) are apparent for a matter of hours or if they last for weeks. I'd wager that if you tested them again a week later you'd get null results.

 




 When they lost Modern Family it appeared on Now TV a day later. Maybe somebody just paid a higher price. 




 Sometimes it's awesome because if I stay calm I can generally transition from sleep paralysis into a lucid dream.

Sometimes it's just the most terrifying feeling, you can put all your effort into moving and nothing gives. You start to worry it'll never end. Luckily I've realised that sleep paralysis doesn't extend to my tongue, so if I freak out I start moving my tongue a lot and movement seems to slowly return to the rest of my body. Man, I'm weird. 




 As a 23 year old who has just had a cancer scare, this hits home pretty hard. Thank you for sharing this and I'm glad you've found meaning in your life, this message is something I'll be sure to look back on in times of need. 




 Is a black hole as big as it "looks"? From my limited understanding a black hole has such a high mass that light cannot escape. Is the material all condensed in the middle with a larger surrounding area that light cannot escape? Or is the visible size of the black hole also the size of all the mass it contains? Is it even possible for us to know this? 




 I agree, the thing that worked for me was to not allow myself any snooze time so that I just get up. 




 I can't give any better advice than everyone else has already, but you may find this article interesting.

 You have a completely valid point. But a good reason not to write God off is that it can be comforting to think that maybe there's more to life than what we immediately realise. Even if it's a lie that I tell myself, it's a harmless lie that only serves to make me happier. I understand that this is illogical and understand why many people can't make the same decision I have, but it works for me. 




 So I haven't switched to the complete polar opposite view, but I used to completely write off the existence of a God. Now I feel more agnostic about things - maybe there is a God, we have no idea what forms, limitations and capabilities a God could potentially have.

 If that is genuinely the case, then great. But that's a very easy thing to kid yourself into believing whilst you're in a relationship, after breaking up you often get a whole new perspective.  




 Well wait a second there, selfless and loving is a great thing and all, but letting yourself be walked all over most definitely is not. Not everyone is worthy of unconditional positive regard and a cheater certainly isn't.  




 I joined Toastmasters (a public speaking club). When someone stands up to talk in front of a room of people I feel it's like putting magnifying glass up to their social skills - you quickly learn what you need to improve on. For me it was eye contact, improving this has made a huge difference for me! 




 Condoms. They last for years anyway and it turns out my personality is much more effective. 




 Once you read the mindset of some of the guys on that sub you can see they've gone too far. Instead of excessive masturbation, they end up defining their life by non-masturbation and letting it affect everything they do. 




 If Curiosity was being covertly observed by martians they would have lost their shit when this happened. Hundreds of scientific papers would be published attempting to explain this lonely tune, which is ultimately meaningless.

 I can't comment on the scientific side of this, but anecdotally I have been in an almost identical situation before. I found it much easier to gain the muscle back, but a lot of that came from the belief that I could achieve my goal as I had done so once before.

 It's pretty tiring to be mindful at all times, but it's useful to be able to identify when you're going through a stressful situation and become mindful at that point. 

Also it's pretty great to become mindful when you're in a relaxing situation like sitting on the beach - everything becomes that little bit more satisfying.


Oh, and sex.

 I watched a documentary once about how the drug testing system works. You have to tell them exactly where you're going to be at all times, days in advance. I think one of the people interviewed said they had to work out where they'd be on certain points of their long-distance runs.

 I'm starting to wonder if the reason a lot of guys on Reddit complain about never getting a girlfriend is because they're so damn fussy. 




 The difficult truth is that you need to stop yourself thinking these thoughts. It's something that I've had to do myself and I know that it's immensely difficult. But this sort of thinking becomes a habit and it will become worse and worse if you don't take a stand now. 

From your meditation you've hopefully gained an awareness of what's going through your mind, you need to use this awareness as much as possible to identify these bad thoughts.

The next (and most difficult) step is to take a leap of faith and stop letting yourself think these thoughts. I know how difficult this is, and part of me was scared that I wouldn't be "prepared" for bad eventualities if I did this. However, taking this leap of faith will set you free completely.

When things get tough, think of it as habit training. You've trained yourself into bad thinking habits, you can train yourself out of them too.

Good luck!

 I don't believe in God in a traditional sense, but I'm open to the idea that there could be something out there akin to a God. It could have personality flaws, it may not be powerful enough to be aware of everything it created, hell, it may even be that our universe is a kids toy to teach baby aliens the meaning of life and death.

I simply accept the idea that there are so many things that I will never understand and maybe a God would be one of those things. 
























 Glad I viewed that on public transport! 




 Not quite, but Sports Direct are interested in buying out this particular store. 




 I don't think we do, but there's a store called Next that is infamous for its "sales". They actually put out entirely different stock than normal and say it's on offer, for some reason people go mental for this particular sale and queue up for hours before they open. It's like a mini Black Friday. 




 I think I heard somewhere that the products have to have been sold at the "was" price within the last 6 months. There are so many damn loopholes though I'm sure they'll get away with it, just like that DFS one.  




 I know of a store that has had a "sale" on for over 6 months now. People think they're making huge savings and it pisses me off so much cos the price has never actually been reduced. 

In fact, does anyone know if this legal in the UK? I'd love for Trading Standards to stumble across this one.

 Hi everyone,

My name is Josh and am the current Vice President of Membership at Reading Speakers Club. The club is part of an international speaking organisation called Toastmasters International (NOT the guys in the red coats, don't worry) and we're always on the look out for new members who want to improve their public speaking/leadership skills in a safe, supportive environment.

I personally joined the club last year and I can't believe the progress that I've made in such a short time - 9 months ago I was on the verge of being diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, but thanks to the confidence I gained at this club I'm now happier than ever. Its a very rare thing for a person to make permanent and genuine change in themselves, but every month I witness more and more people growing in confidence and becoming truly talented speakers at this club.

I just wanted to put the word out there that this club exists, as it is not always well publicised. Our next meeting is at 7:30pm, Monday 6th July at Salisbury Conservative Club (near Cemetery Junction).

Please feel free to come along as a guest and see if this club is for you. It's a great group of people who are all really fun, supportive and willing to go the extra mile to help you. 

PM me for more details or visit the website https://www.toastmasters.org/
 




 Fellow plane viewer here! Unfortunately I watched it on the way back from Australia and it made me want to book more travelling straight away, wish I'd seen it on the way out! 




 Got a one line email from head office saying "Good job" though. Worth it!  




 Two main reasons in this case. 1. This guy steals as a business and is a regular around my town, he'll head out with a list of requests and then sell them on to his buyers. 2. I was really fucking bored on that shift and I couldn't resist the adrenaline rush! 




 I stopped a shoplifter the other week and haven't stopped telling everyone about it, if I'd saved hundreds of kids you'd never heard the end of it. 




 I tend to get that with international students a lot who couldn't afford to do one at home. Always a bit of an awkward situation as somebody was convinced they'd spotted a tumour in their scan once and we got an angry phone call from their GP asking why we gave pictures out. 

It was nothing more than a spot of hypochondria though! 




 Mission accepted, I will report back to you!
RemindMe! One year "Are you big yet?" 




 Can confirm that we do this at Universities. However it's unlikely you'll be given much information about your brain, also there's no way we can tell how many neurons you'd have. Still, it's cool to have a picture :)

 173lbs? Damn I wish so wasn't so lanky, I'd look great if my weight wasn't stretched over  4 miles of gangly limbs! 




 Read this as "human torch". I'm glad you're not a psychopath. 





























 And the reality is that people are changing every day. Both people need to be prepared to support the other to grow as a human being but it doesn't occur to a lot of people. 




 I feel the same, but I think I'm just getting older.  




 Not if you're left handed with t-Rex arms like me! 




 I think that if you want further guidance that is written in a more accessible way you should read The Untethered Soul. It really put forward these concepts in a way I could relate to, as I found that Tolle comes across as a little bit too "out there".

If I could sum it up in one sentence, try to be the attention but not the judgement.  




 So if those two cops in The Other Guys had just done backflips they would have landed safely in the bushes?! 




 Who in their right minds would ban such a glorious bot? 




 It appears I have somehow summoned a bot. Strange that when I want them they're nowhere to be seen! 




 Ohh of course, I wasn't thinking about the bar as well! Thanks! 




 Why is it that 225lbs is such a big deal in weightlifting? 100kg in UK makes more sense as a landmark, 225lbs seems a bit random. 




 And is anyone else kind of, dare I say it, glad that those particular subreddits were banned? 




 Hey I think I have the perfect solution for you. I literally just finished this men's 30 day yoga challenge yesterday and absolutely loved it. It's only ~10 minutes a day and now I'm just excited to do more!

 Hey FluffleUffle,

I've had a similar experience before where I thought a symptom was a bad sign, by worrying about it I became hyper-vigilant and much more aware of even the slightest sensation. 

Headaches and anxiety go hand in hand - you probably don't realise but your anxiety makes your whole body cave in and hunch. This includes your shoulders, head and neck. Try and become aware of any tension you are holding as it is not uncommon for anxiety to cause tension headaches, which in turn feeds the anxiety.

Have you given any consideration to trying mindfulness? This might help you become more aware of these processes and help you to prevent them before they get to the point where you get a headache.

Personally I ruined three months of my life thinking I had cancer. When I finally found out that I was completely healthy I was angry at myself for wasting so much of my time being miserable. Go to the doctor if you think this one-off reassurance will help you. But don't let the Doctor's reassurance become a crutch.

Good luck, you can do it :)
