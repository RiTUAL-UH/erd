 Exactly! I don't know how you can get a job at a bookstore without at least knowing Faulkner 




 "As I stand before you today, I can tell you why we shouldn't change minimum wage. You may think I'm a rich man. This is a lie. I work minimum wage like a lot of you. Pleas don't expect people to pay more, so we may feed and take care of our families. Please don't ask my employer to pay me more... It's not like he can afford it. Please don't make me a burden to other's. I should be thankful to have a job, right? Is that what I'm expected to say? My children should suffer for the mistakes a younger me made. Because that will make them work harder? Make them get jobs as soon as they can, so they won't focus on school and resent me later for not being able to provide? So they will be stuck in this never-ending cycle of poverty due to not having the support to get a higher education? Yes, this is the life I've always dreamed of. As a child, I dreamed of never having a set schedule, never getting to go to school functions, having to miss my children growing up due to having to work more and more to support them, not getting holidays with my family, being terrified of illness because I can't afford not to work. This is the American dream, right? But please, don't make my employers pay me a living wage... As if I deserve it after staying late, coming in early, and never calling in. What more do I do? I could easily be replaced. I am nothing. Is this what I deserve? Is this what we deserve? Most of us "leech" of the "working" while working more hours than normal. They see nothing more than my food stamp card. They don't know that I work more than I sleep. They don't see me. They don't see you... Just leeches. But remember please, don't ask for more pay. Your CEO doesn't have that kind of money. Stop being so selfish why don't you? It's not like you have the right to spend time with your loved ones."

A man who's job was threatened if he didn't give a speech against minimum wage, give his boss exactly what he wants yet doesn't expect. 




 Anyone who likes Jersey Shore/ Snooki, people who are obsessed with celebrity gossip, the willfully ignorant, intolerance, people who like Miley Cyrus... I could go on forever... 




 I walked into a Books-A-Million and asked where the Faulkner books were. The worker looked at me completely serious and asked who Faulkner was... I walked out. So, who knows what schools are having people read now! 




 Some times you have implantation bleeding a few weeks after the sex. Some girls confuse it for a period 




 I would say you would be suffering from PTSD. I'm sad to say, you might have to deal with this your whole life. A good support system is a great way to handle it. From your post it seems you have good communication with your current boyfriend, so he most likely understands. Try to talk about why you feel that way and work from the core out! 




 I think that only time can lead to feeling comfortable in a relationship if a partner has an... interesting sexual past. It's self preservation. Sadly, I think, still, people are judged so easily by what they chose to do in private. It's still that taboo subject. Maybe if we brought it more out in the open and stopped shaming it, people would be judged less because it takes the secret out of it. I'm not in favor of flaunting, but civil, mature conversations is one of the few ways we can overcome this. 




 The book that has stuck with my is Loose Girl: A Memoir of Promicuity by Kerri Cohen. It really makes you think about why people act the way they do, and not to judge people by their sexual history. I have to pick it up once a year and re-read it. Anytime I see some one (boy or girl) acting in a promiscuous way, I think of that book, and it reminds me that despite their actions, he/she is a person and deserves respect (reasonably) and might just need some one to be in their life consistently. 




 Thank you! I really don't know where I would be without them! 




 It's ok to be upset. As long as, it isn't affecting your relationship. I've been with my boyfriend for about 7 months, and I still call him by my exes name sometimes. It's because he spent time with said ex and needs to get used to having someone new in his life. Just remind yourself that she's his ex, and he loves you now! :)! Hope I could help! 




 My mom isn't a Harry Potter fan, but I always bonded with my step dad over it. After he passed away, she helped me organize a Harry Potter Marathon in his memory with close friends and then bought me the Wizarding Collection despite the high price. Now we are going to the Harry Potter theme park (my last vacation with my step dad), and she's taking my boyfriend with us for support in case I can't handle being there. 
























 The Harry Potter references make this story that much better! I laughed so hard at the Golden Snitch line! 




 That's been my fear. That's why I haven't tried to talk to it. I don't want to open myself up to possession. I know the full history of the house I'm in now. The other was a bit more blurry! I don't even know if my town has a historian, sadly  




 I definitely am! Just glad to be out of the other house! Never liked it from the first time we toured it. 




 Thank you! I have thought about that. I really hope it's him. It would make life that much easier. :) 




 Thank you. I would try to talk to it, but I'm really worried that it might be something more sinister. Something  trying to lead me into false comfort. 




 I wasn't going to post my story because I thought my life was back to normal. That was before last night. When weird things started happening, my step father had just been diagnosed with Stage IV cancer. The only people in my house were my mom, my step dad, my boyfriend, and me. My step father couldn't go to the bathroom himself, and if my mom had to go, she would call me into the living room to sit with him. He was never unattended. Furthermore, my room was right beside the bathroom. I could hear anyone coming in or out.

Let me also explain about my step father, he was a police officer and where I live, police have to get extensive physicals every year to stay on the force. He also frequently got strep, so he had blood work done every time he had it due to the hospital visit. We had just moved into an older house, and I always felt uneasy in the house. There was just something off about it. Less than a year after we move, my step dad who has always been given a clean bill of health was diagnosed with Stage IV cancer. They said it had to have been there for at least 6-7 years. We had no clue where it had come from. I immediately thought of A Haunting in Connecticut, how the boy got sicker after moving into an old house. How else would I explain my step father getting so sick so fast?

When the weird stuff started happening to me, my boyfriend isn't living with me. I have always been deathly afraid of the dark. I've slept with my tv on for as long as I can remember. I can't stand the sounds houses make at night, so the sound drowns it out and provides light. I sleeping pretty peacefully when it was disturbed by a dream that wouldn't be scary to normal people. It was an older lady glaring at me. I've never seen this lady, but I had a deep feeling that she was evil and wanted to cause me harm. I woke up with a jolt and was overwhelmed with the same feeling I had in the dream. I can't explain how I know, but I knew it was her. Then I quickly noticed my tv was off. My mom wouldn't turn my tv off because she knows I need it. I got a horrible feeling of dread through me. I quickly grabbed my remote to get the tv back on. Needless to say, I didn't go back to sleep that night.

About a month and a half later, I was still getting that terrified feeling throughout my house occasionally, but I was starting I get used to it because my boyfriend started staying with me. We had been laying in bed all day because it was one of my few days off, so I would know if anyone had gone to the bathroom recently. When I got up to use the bathroom, I could hear water running, which was very odd because no one had been in there. It wasn't possible. When I opened the bathroom door, our bathroom was flooded because someone (something?) had turned our sink on full blast. I quickly called out to my mom who confirmed my suspicions. No one had been to the bathroom. As we cleaned the mess, my mom was comforting me, and I let her reason calm me, quickly turning away any thoughts of paranormal.

Sadly, the next part in my story was the worst time in my life. My step father had just been taken to the hospital, and the family had been called in. We were living at the hospital basically. My mom made me go to my grandmother's to get some rest, so my friend Molly drove me and My friend Robin to our respective houses. On the way to Robin's, Molly slammed the brakes and asked if we had seen something run I front of the car. Neither of us had, so we just assumed it was an animal because we live in a mountainous area. Animals weren't uncommon. Nothing happened the rest of the ride, until Molly dropped me off at the end of my drive way. As I was walking toward my house, I saw the figure of a man duck behind a car, so I took off at a sprint to get to the safety of home. When I turned around, I saw a black cat walking toward me from where I had just seen the man. I got into the house and locked the door. I texted Molly what had happened. She replied, "I don't want to scare you anymore, but I thought it was a black cat that I saw driving Robin home..." After a short conversation, I drifted off into an uneasy sleep. The next day, I went to my house to clean up some. I must explain that I lived in a high class neighborhood, so there were no stray animals around. When I got to my house, I saw a black cat sitting beside the door. After that, I quickly cleaned up because I didn't want to be in that house any longer. My step father died that night.

For a couple months after my step father died, everything was calm, so I chocked everything that had happened as stress. Then one morning as I was getting ready for class, I was brushing my teeth before I showered. I went to turn the water off, but I didn't turn the handle all the way, so I had to reach and turn the handle further. I got in the shower, but when I got out. The water was turned on full blast. After that, I started getting ready faster in the mornings, so I didn't have to be in the house. One morning, my mom was still home, so I decided to take my time getting ready. When I was in the shower, I could clearly hear my step father saying hello to me. I didn't get the terrified feeling I normally got. Instead I was filled with joy. The last thing that happened in that house before we moved happened around 3 am. I was working late shift, so it was common that I would be cooking at these times. As I was waiting on the oven to heat up, the coffee pot came on without anyone touching it. Now, some might think it could have been set like an alarm, but no one in my house drinks coffee. It was my step father's, so I went to investigate and the coffee pot wasn't even plugged in.

Finally, this brings me to the present. My mother went to the beach, but I stayed home because I had to work. One night, I heard growling coming from my living room, but both dogs were in bed with me. There was nothing in the house to make that sound. I closed my bedroom door and laid in bed, until I couldn't stay awake anymore. I was ecstatic when Mom came home the next day.

Finally, last night, the thing that made me post my story. I was going to get ready for work, so I walked through the house to get a towel. When I came back through, my mom asked what I was doing. I told her going to shower for work. She looked at me confused and said she thought I had already showered. She heard it running. My mom and I are the only ones in the house. I went to the bathroom to check out her claim. Nothing was out of place, no running water. I still didn't shower that night.

Please, tell me what is following my family and why it only affects me.

[Edit] Grammar and puncheon due to posting from phone. 




 That's so sad. Rape culture hurts men just as much as girls though. I just don't understand blaming a victim. I'm always horrified at those attitudes... "Well, she was showing cleavage, so she clearly wanted to have sex." What logic is that?! Most dressier women's clothing has some sort of cut to it. 




 I work at a small chain grocery store. In our store, anyone can walk into the meat department and from there the meat cooler. People leave the meat shop at probably 8-8:30 every night and manager leaves at 7. The problem? Everyone left is a regular associate. Regular associate's can't say anything to shoplifters, and if they would and something would happen, said store won't compensate because it's "not in the job description." Leading to a lot of stolen merchandise and workers getting yelled at by management... 




 Considering that you said it's lower class, it's kinda sad that it might have been nice to her. It might have been the best she could get, and she was just happy for it... 




 It could be PTSD. He could have been having a flashback to a military funeral where he was looking at the coffin of someone he knew and was saluting it... It's very sad. 




 I don't know if you looked at The Noble Collection online. They have a lot of cool stuff! 
























 This past week I went to the new Diagon Alley section of Universal Studios. I was not disappointed. Hogsmeade was amazing, and Diagon Alley only added to that.
Going through the park, you can ride the Hogwarts Express and walk through a brick wall. The only problem is that you don't know you're doing it. Other people can see it, but you just see yourself walking through a door way. After riding both ways, my boyfriend and I hadn't found the wall, so we decided to ask about it. We, not thinking, asked on the Muggle London side. When I asked, the worker gave me a very confused look and informed me that there was Platforms 9 and 10 and if I wanted, I could throw quarters at the wall. She also advised I not walk through a wall because it would hurt. I walked away no closer to the wall, and yet I was completely satisfied.
Later, my family (me representing Gryffindor and my mom and boyfriend representing Slytherin) were approached by a dark looking witch. Conversation is as follows:
Witch (W): "You keep good company, Gryffindor!"
Me: "I don't think so" with a grin.
Witch: "Where is your wand?!"
Me: "It's at home. I forgot it."
Witch: "You better be careful especially in Knockturn Alley. It isn't safe for a Gryffindor witch. Better hope your friends protect you."

It was an amazing experience! Delicious Cottage Pie in the Leaky Caldron. Amazing Deathly Hallows show. Wonderful ice cream! Everyone should consider trying to make a trip, but I suggest staying at a resort to get early entry. Escape from Gringotts was a 5 hour wait by the third ride! 




 I looked at her recent posts, and 4 days ago she posted about feeling like someone is watching her. Then 68 days ago she said she didn't feel safe anymore. That's really scary. 




 With this scam, I assumed the "scientific code" was the number to a prepay card he had already stolen, so when I would type it in, the money would go on to his card and not the one I rang up. Then I would need to cash it out to be activated. 




 It's a good thing that I work nightshift, and only have to see her an hour every shift 




 Sorry about formatting and errors! I'm on mobile! I posted a little while back about my douche manager and did pretty well, so I'm going to do another about the douche daytime supervisor... She's not even my boss

If you missed my first post, I work in a regional grocery store putting up sale signs and hanging price tags on night shift. Of course, my boss was on vacation. Bad things always happen when he leaves. We got a phone call to the store after hours. The person claimed to be the store manager and asked to speak to someone who could run a register. I was the only one there who could, so I go to the phone. He tells me that he's my boss (not the store manager). So, I'm already suspicious, but since they're both named Michael, I thought maybe the man that answered the phone misheard. He proceeds to tell me to grab a pay as you go money card, put money on it, and he would give me a "scientific code" to put into the register, cash it out, and put it and the receipt on his desk. I tell him that he should know I can't cash out a transaction without the customer being there, but he can call back when the front line boss comes in. He then asks when they'll come in. I already know this is clearly not my boss or the store manager because they would know when the morning shift came in. So I tell him at 6:00 am when the store opens. He yells at me and tells me that he's the store manager and knew when the store opened and that he needed the cards done before 6am. I apologize and continue to tell him I can't do said transaction. He hangs up on me.

When the day shift boss comes in, I tell her about the scam. She yells at me for doing the transaction. My mouth drops at first and I stare at her. When she's done yelling, I tell her I didn't do. She then proceeds to tell me I did a good job but never apologizes for yelling even though I told her at the beginning that I didn't do the transaction. Later, when I check my company email, it turns out another store in the area fell for the scam and lost $10,000.

Did she really think I was that dumb?! 




 Thank you! He was recently promoted to manager, and his head is huge now... He was bad before. He's unbearable now. 




 Please excuse grammar and formatting! I'm on mobile 

I work in a regional grocery store putting up signs and changing price tags. Corporate expects 1089 tags hung in 8 hours. My department manager was on vacation. I'm the only one trained to do my job and his, so I'm doing both of our jobs for only 50 cents more. My company doesn't allow overtime, so I had to ask the store manager to let me leave early because I had 5000 tags to hang in one night. Clearly, I couldn't get it done, so I was gonna go over. When I ask him, he seems confused about why I have so many hours. I inform him that since my boss is on vacation that's I'm working both jobs. He's still confused about why my department gets 40 hours a week. We hang every sale sign and make sure every price is right every day.

Fast forward to later that day, I'm walking around the store making sure all our major sale signs are correct. Up comes the store manager, he asks if I will clean the break room. He didn't seem urgent, and he didn't specify when. I agree assuming he means after I check prices which is more important. Not 5 minutes later, he runs back up to me asking if I cleaned the break room. I reply, "Sorry, Sir. I was going to do it after I checked prices." He proceeds to yell in my face and tell me we have "enough" signs. So I drop what I'm doing to clean the PRIVATE break room.

I'm finally done with the break room and go back to the floor. As I walk past the deli area, I hear douche manager yelling at them for not having a sign up that they had asked me to make, so I walk over, give him my nicest smile, and say "Sir, I was on my way to make that sign when you told me we had enough and that cleaning the break room was more important." He storms away because I didn't do anything to actually get in trouble.

Fast forward not even 20 minutes later, he comes to find me to ask if I'll make a sign for a bread rack. When I go to check prices, I realize they're all different prices, and I don't have room to make a sign for every thing. I tell my manager. He yells in my face again asking why I can't just do my job. I proceed to walk over to the rack and make a sign for the cheapest item on there so if anyone complains about the price of a more expensive item on the rack, they'll get it for the price of the cheapest one. Clearly, my manager hasn't a clue about my job!

Edit: Minor grammar fixes 




 Oh good! Hopefully it'll help! :) 




 My gosh! I can't imagine that. I've heard Alzheimer's is horribly hard to watch. Your stories just make me more worried about my parents getting it. I'm so sorry for you family. I'm not sure what else to say. 




 I'm sorry you went through that! 




 I'm a Psychology major, and one of the theories involved behavior of older people. We learned that older people who are mean and hateful are unhappy and regretful about their life. While happy, nice older people are generally content and satisfied with the life they've lead. I don't know which is sadder mental illness or being so miserable with your life that your mean to people. 
























 I'm getting him a baby sock for Christmas! 









 If you have a Twitter, follow Orlando Informer or just check the page. It was a Godsend for helping plan everything. Try to go as early as you can if you plan on riding Escape from Gringotts, don't know how busy it still is, but less than half an hour after early entry, there was a 5 hour wait not counting general admission times. The train is a must! Make sure to ride to Hogsmeade and back to Diagon Alley. It's a different ride. If I were you, I would go straight to the Studios side, before it gets too crowded. The butter beer ice cream was amazing, and chocolate has a kick at the end. The mixing station doesn't taste too well. Just flavored water. You must watch the Deathly Hallows show in Diagon Alley! Also, get an interactive wand and look out for places to use it. The chicken sandwich, Guinness stew, and cottage pie is delicious in The Leaky Caldron. The Three Broomsticks have wonderful chicken. Sorry it's so long! Have fun! 




 http://www.orlandoinformer.com/2012/harry-potter-butterbeer-recipe/

There's a lot of recipes on here, but my boyfriend and I love the first one! Apparently it's good if you add butterscotch schnapps if you're 21! 




 Well, thank you for that. Exactly you're question is based on what we don't know. 




 I had always assumed the egg still had the spell that made it impossible to obtain through the accio spell, so he knew he couldn't use the spell. 




 Hagrid never graduated. Maybe I should have said graduate. My apologies. As for the other part, I've never read or heard anything like that. 




 I think that Hermione would lead the way for more freedom for house elves who wanted to be free, but less cruelty for the ones who still work. I don't think Harry would live in a mansion. I think he's much too modest for that. As weird as it may seem, I think Neville might be headmaster. He's fair and brave, with Harry's influence it might be possible. I believe Luna would go on to be editor of the popular newspaper The Quibbler because of the fall of the Dark Lord, no one trusted The Daily Prophet anymore, and Luna lead the way to discover the creatures she always claimed existed. I like to think Hagrid ended up married the the Ms. Maxime and having children, who were the first humanoids allowed in Hogwarts. 









 I didn't even think this would ever be a question?! 




 I don't know how accurate it is, but while riding the Hogwarts Express. You can hear Ron ask Hermione to conjure food, and she says it's against the law of Transfiguration. That could be the only thing I could think would explain it. 
























 Like constantly walking around with a taser, or having my boyfriend accompany me? I do. The reality is. It can still happen. 




 Thank you! I'll keep all that in mind! I'll look through some of my favorite books and study up on the dialogue! 




 Thank you so much! I'll definitely try those! 




 So, I have a book lined out and ideas completed, but I have a horrible time with dialogue. I know the characters and how they are, but when they talk to one another, it seems like a bad movie or a cheesy rom-com. Any suggestions? 




 In the novel I'm writing, I plan on having the man in love with the main girl, and she kills him in the end. So many would-be da girls would throw their books across the room. I want to break that stereotype. She then goes on to rule the land without a husband or children 




 I would totally want to read something like that! 









 There was a story a lot like your's. I don't remember the name exactly, but she completely ignored its presence and it dissipated after awhile. Might try that. 




 I think that the pros just didn't like Reach and 4, so they quit because most of them came back for MCC competitions. 




 He is so beautiful! I will post a picture when I get his Christmas presents! Baby socks! Also, sorry about the deleted reply! I didn't realize I was on my boyfriend's account! 




 Sure will! :) 
























 I don't care about men forming clubs. I do care about the actions of a few of their members. I never said anything about other frats. Just one in general. 




 Thank you! I don't let it bother me. I understand that this isn't a problem and extreme worry for other, and it's okay that they don't understand. You have to be ready for that anytime you make a post! I'm just glad you've understood this and take it seriously. 




 Would you like me to on you the professors email so you can ask him yourself? 




 I never said it was reported. Most rape goes unreported, and honestly being accused makes me more than hesitant around them! 




 Thank you for being so nice and realizing that I am honestly afraid of this! I talk to my boyfriend about it, and he is super wonderful! I might go to the campus counselor and see if he/she can help!
 




 That is very true! I just try to be prepared and ready for any situation 




 One of the girls in my class was recently talking about how they basically haven't changed. That most girls in general try to avoid them because they are still being accused of rapes recently 




 I worry about that too. Just not as much. Maybe I'm a chronic worrier. Who knows?  




 Thank you! I don't really get a chance to talk to many peers at the college because I work full time and take classes. It mostly scares me because my apartment is located by all the frat houses, and one of the frats that was recently reinstated that was originally shut down for rape. Apparently, much hasn't changed, sadly. 




 It is 1 in 4 at my college. Our professors mention it at the beginning of every semester to try to get girls to better protect themselves. 




 I'm not trolling. I'm being honest. Nothing feminist here. I am a feminist, but I don't hate men. Never have never will. I don't want special treatment for being a girl. 
























 Sorry if I upset you! This isn't me. This was a girl in my class! That was the statistic and "proof" that she showed! I thought it was absurd, and wondered what others had to say about it! 




 Thanks for the advice! That's not me though, a girl in my class was talking about it, and I was curious if other girls felt the same. I think it's crazy. I said it was me because people say different things if you say it's someone else. Thank you for being kind! 




 Well, lucky for you! There's a more recent one coming out this year! :)!  




 Yes, future. That doesn't prove it hasn't happened. Also, no bragging. I wouldn't want to be one of the people who are accused of "asking for it" because of the way I was dressed 




 Have problem now that I provided statistics. Everyone knows that any school crime report only counts reported which doesn't paint the whole picture. 

https://www.rainn.org/get-information/statistics/reporting-rates 




 How do you know the last part? For all you know, I could have been. Had things said to me before, and now avoid it all.

 If I was "excited" to get raped, why would I try to avoid it? It's disturbing that you think anyone would be excited by rape. That's disturbing. 




 As i said to someone else, if you want the email to the professor who told us this, I'll happily pm it to you. I have no problem with you asking him 




 I'm not stereotyping people that get raped. I'm using questions that people actually ask when people get raped. Anyone can be raped. I know this. I don't believe anyone was "asking for it". If it ever happens, I would rather people that believe that have no room to talk. 





























 I've always figured that it was one of those things he didn't want people knowing he knew about for obvious reasons. That would just give the ministry more bs to post about him in the Prophet. 




 It's not like Dumbledore could just hand it to them, but if he planted it for them to find. Why would Filch take a random piece of parchment from someone? He would have no clue what it was.  




 Yep! It's a place for scary stories and experiences, but remember when commenting, you take everything you read as true no matter how outlandish it might be! 




 This might seem like a weird theory, but I always thought Dumbledore might have purposely lead them to it because he believed it would help Harry in the future. I always got the vibe that almost everything that happened to Harry at Hogwarts, Dumbledore had some hand in. 




 No, trying to make people made is riling people up. I wasn't trying to make anyone angry. Don't know why anyone would get mad over something posted on the Internet. 




 I didn't want to rile people up. I wanted reactions. Not everyone was rilled up 




 And curious. People might have responded differently had I said it was someone else 




 Good! Trust me. Everyone in class just kinda looked at her with an awkward silence 




 Sorry if I upset you! This was a girl in my class! I thought it was absurd and wondered what others would think if it was said 




 Sorry if I upset you! This was a girl in my class not me. I thought it was absurd and was curious as to what others thought! 
























 LoL! I don't think my managers and the police would be as forgiving this time of it happened. It would be horrible if it malfunctioned and went off tonight without me touching it. They'd never believe me! 




 My God! She is an idiot! I don't understand why someone would press it if they had already been warned about what it does!? Ugh. People. Thankful, no one got fined or anything because it hasn't happened before and we already warned them that it was malfunctioning! 




 Trust me! Had I known what it was, I never would have touched it! I had just never even been told there was one! 

Also, who's Carol? 




 Thank you! I'm working now, and I have no idea if it's working. I'm not testing it though! 




 Seriously! We're a college town, so the college has its own police force leaving the rest of the town to the others. Not much left in this town if you take the college away 




 That's what I thought. I didn't think we had one out there because the other jobs I've had showed me the panic buttons during orientation. My manager said he wasn't even sure where it was... It's surprising because they call our city Little Detroit because the drugs and crime. 




 Thank God it was my favorite manager there. Had it been the other two, I definitely would have at least gotten written up. They couldn't fire me because we're union! 




 That's what I thought! By the time they got there, I had completely forgot about the box! Yeah, my manager mentioned that it's a good thing that we knew it malfunctioned now. Apparently, it's been there since the place opened and was really outdated! 




 That would be absolutely terrifying! Thank God there were no guns out because it was clear once they got there that everything was fine!  




 I work in a growing grocery store that has a gas station attached to it. I was recently asked to work the fuel section while one of the girls went on vacation. I knew nothing about the panic button. Chaos ensued.

I was sitting in my room, and I notice this white box thing with a hole and something that looks like a suction cup in it. Ive never been told about it and never noticed it. I get busy and forget about the box. We die when my co-worker comes in to sit with me. I notice the box again and start looking around it, but there is nothing on this box.

So, me being me, I start playing around with to figure it out. I was messing with the black thingie and accidentally pushed it in some. When nothing happened, I figured it was some old, disconnected button for the pumps or something. About 25 minutes later, I see 4 cop cars fly into the parking lot.

One comes up to my window and asks if Im ok. I give him a confused look and tell him that Im fine and ask why. He told me the emergency button went off, so I asked where it was, and he told me around the register. Then it hit me what I had been playing with. I ask him how to turn it off, and he says to call the manager.

The manager comes out and asked what happened. We both tell him that were not sure. Then he pops the button out and says it should be off. About 10 minutes later, corporate calls to tell us the panic alarm is on, and to let the manager know. So we call him again, and he says hell be out there.

By this time, I tell Matt that I need to go pee. I go explain to the manager what had happened and explained that I just didnt want to say it in front of my co-worker. I didnt get in trouble because I told him before he went to watch the cameras, and he understood my embarrassment. He then walks out there while on the phone with support. It turns out the box had actually malfunctioned and couldnt be turned off. They suspended it and let the cops know. Tomorrow, maintenance is coming to fix the box... 




 My life has been quite hectic recently. I apologize if this is all over the place. My mind has been quite *different*. I can't explain what is happening, but I'm hoping you can. I'll start from the beginning.
I work at a growing chain of grocery stores that have gas stations attached. I'm normally just a stocker, but my department is also responsible for helping run fuel center. Since the main girl out there went on vacation, I was scheduled to close up by myself. We close at 11 every night. Never early. I expected it to be a great week. After 8, the fuel center dies, and we are allowed to play on our phones and entertain ourselves. I decided to bring my DS and play Pokemon to pass the time. I was quite excited to get so lucky.


Man, was I wrong.


My first evening was going fine, until my co-worker left, leaving me alone. The first hour flew by in a flurry of winning battles and catching Pokemon. Soon, it started. I could hear a woman almost  shrieking, so I looked out my windows to see no one at the pumps. I then look at my camera monitor, but it's blurry. I've never seen it blurry, but I put it off as a glitch. I stepped out to see if maybe I was hearing the song from our speakers outside, but there was nothing. I blew it off as my imagination and continued with my night. Soon, I heard what sounded like someone trying to get into my small office, so I look at my monitor again, and it's acting really strange. It will go blurry, glitch, and then go clear. In the moments of clarity, I can see there is no one out there even though I can hear the banging and knob rattling. I call my boyfriend, and he calms me down. Soon, I have to go out to lock down the machines and other merchandise outside, so I get off the phone and hurry about my business outside. I figured since I had been outside for about 20 minutes and nothing happened that I had imagined everything. So, I close the inside and lock up. On my way to drop off the key to the main store, I can hear a whistling, but there is no one around and the radio had been turned off. I dreaded coming back.


The next day I figured that since I worked with someone my whole shift, and it was during the day, that I would be fine since I had worked it a thousand times during the day. Everything is fine, until my co-worker goes on break. The camera started acting strange again, but there were no weird sounds, so I wasn't too worried. I got up to grab a water out of the back fridge, but as I stood, my radio changed stations without anyone touching it. I walked back to it, and it changed back to my original station. I was freaked out, so I just turned the radio off all together and sat in silence. The rest of the shift was fine.


Then, today was the most intense yet. I came into work already terrified of what awaited me, but I wasn't working alone until the end of my shift. Since things only seem to happen when I'm alone, I figured that I would be ok. Once again, nothing happens even an hour after he leaves, so I think that I'm just going crazy from the social isolation and being alone out in a room by myself. That's when I could hear the shrieking again, but no customers seemed bothered. I put it off as my imagination running wild. It was probably about 10 when I could hear something pounding at my door. I even heard the door open and papers fluttering. I got the courage to look in the back section, and nothing was out of place. I sat with only my phone playing music and looking around at the outside to watch for anything out of the ordinary. When it was time to close up the outside area, I kept getting the uneasy feeling of being watched, and I would catch glimpses of what looked like something in my room. That wasn't possible though. It was locked and I had the only key to it around my neck. I thought that it was only my reflection and hurried to get back to my safe haven. I closed down the inside and started my walk to the store. I got the feeling again that I was being watched, so I turned my head. I wish I hadn't I saw her "standing" in the shadows by the recycling dumpsters. I use quotes because I couldn't see legs on her, just the head and torso. She would have been about 5 foot tall. She had wild black hair with what looked like could have been red highlights, her dress looked like a sack and was dirty and ripped, and her eyes, oh her eyes. They were the only facial characteristic I could see. They were almost black holes. I kept my eyes on her as I rushed back into the store. I dropped the key off and rushed to my car. When I got to my car, I could smell what I assumed to be her. It was a mixture of rotting flesh and old urine. I got in my car and pulled out in a frenzy. I kept looking in my rearview mirror because I thought I saw movement in the backseat, yet there was nothing. No one could be back there because there were two boxes that take up all the room. I get to my parking lot, and I smell the same smell as I'm walking through the alley to my apartment. I then hear steps behind me, so I look... There is nothing again. I bust threw the door of my apartment and explain what had happened that night to my boyfriend. I went to open the bedroom door, but before I got it open, I heard the springs of our bed move as if someone jumped out of bed quickly. I think she followed me. I keep seeing movement by my window. I feel strange. Maybe I'll underssssstand. Maybe I could knnnnnow. Please, help me.

EDIT:

More has happened, last night my window air conditioner turned itself off and on over and over. Then, we woke up this morning to find that my hamster had disappeared. We have 2 hounds, and they would let us know if the hamster was inside the house. There is no way it got out of its cage, and there is no blood or bite marks by the cage. Finally, my job requires a box cutter, and we always put it out of the reach of the animals. We found it across the room behind my tv. Also, when I tried to resubmit this, Reddit had an "emergency maintenance". Just a coincidence?
