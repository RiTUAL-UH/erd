 I can't really see the Greeks wanting to be that rude about the Canadians though..... 




 I bought some wood by the metric foot last week. Gloriously archaic :-) 




 Yup, this is kinda why I've never understood the hang up that people have over the licence fee. If you assume its a mandated tax (it isn't, but hey...) then it's some of the best value you'll ever see for that money.

Personally, I see no reason to pay for satellite or cable - I'm not a big TV watcher anyway and find that nearly everything I enjoy watching comes from the BBC anyway, so I don't see the point in paying for a much wider range of stuff I don't want to see anyway.

Check out Luther or The Escape Artist, both of which are excellent drama series. We're also enjoying The Paradise, which is a more traditional costume drama on its second series now.

There's also a convincing argument that Sherlock is worth the licence fee all on its own... :-) 




 Yup, regions that don't pay the licence fee watch ads to help fund more telly. I have no problem with this. Same with the BBC's web content, I believe.

But on home turf, its strictly non-commercial and this is how it should be. I hate ads and 150pa is a small price to pay to be shut of them.

Interestingly, most Sky subscribers pay 2-3x as much and still get ads on every channel's. This seems a much stranger situation to me... 




 Operation Ouch on CBBC is worth the license fee on its own...well so the kids tell me anyway ;-) 




 Not in Blighty it doesn't. Check your facts please. 




 I enjoy quality programming from the BBC and don't like to watch adverts. 

I'm sure you can make a sustainable TV network without a license fee (note: it's not a tax) but it means watching 20 mins of ads per hour of TV. Oh, and still paying more than the license fee cost to a cable provider for the privilege to watch them.

Thanks, I'll stick with the Beeb. 




 What a bucket of bilge. 




 It would be easier to change the moon's orbit than to move the wife from Waitrose, I'm afraid.

Good queuers there too, BTW ;-) 




 Thank you. It's a strange thing, but if you asked them, I'm sure most customers would also be proud of it.


We Brits can be a strange bunch, but you can always spot us shaking our head at "5 queues for 5 tills" when travelling abroad. It just doesn't happen here...we'd automatically and without a single word being said, create a single master queue feeding all 5 tills in a fair and equal way.

Love it :-) 




 Fair point, but typically the frier cooks the food and neither serves it nor takes payment. He does however accept the initial verbal order ("two large haddock and a battered sausage please, mate") so he can be getting them in to cook while you're properly ordering and paying.

Most decent chippies have an order taker, a wrapper and a frier. 




 My local chip shop (Leeds, UK) has a very strict queuing system:

1. Enter shop. Place order with frier who starts cooking it immediately.
2. Walk straight to till, place order and pay
3. Walk to back of queue.
4. Wait.
5. You are served strictly in order and the best part is that while you're queuing you're food is being cooked, so you're not really being held up
6. Collect food and enjoy it.

Efficient, brutally fair, and all freshly cooked. I've been to many, many chip shops and found few that work like this. I've also found none that serve better food and cope with a lot of customers so efficiently. Shops that don't work like this actually make me stressed!

Queuing is culturally embedded in Britain and I'd have it no other way. 




 Give me back my fortress, you bastards! 




 I loved ad d (note username ;-) but my heart still lies with Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay (way before the battle stuff) and, even earlier, the wonderful Dragon Warriors series. I enjoy fantasy because of these two wonderful series.

Not sure how much light they saw outside of blighty though.

Love em still :-) 




 As a parent of two (5 and 7), I still read to them every night. For the eldest, we mix it up between me reading to her, her reading to me and her reading by herself, but neither of us is quite ready for me to stop reading to her - after all, it's fun :)

Stephen Fry reads Harry Potter to us all when travelling in the car. Does this count? 




 Yup, and that's also why they don't take off planes noise to tail. If they did, following aircraft would hit turbulence caused by the previous take off... which may be very serious indeed.

Check "wake vortex" for more info. 




 Indeed. Although when you realise that you've left your phone, the first thing you do is....reach for your phone!

In my case, I'd been dropped at a hotel so ran inside and borrowed the concierge's phone to quickly call mine. It just rang out and I started to panic then looked out of the window to see the cabbie waving at me from the drop off area.

Shock news! Most people aren't arseholes! (Well, ones in the real world anyway ;-) 




 I left my phone in a London taxi. After realising I'd done so, I called the number and the friendly taxi driver drove back and returned it, earning himself a nice tip.

The end :) 




 Wireshark. Unquestionably the most useful tool in any IT admins tool bag.

Not free, but I'd rather use a Mac than be without ALTAP Salamander. Any two pane file explorer would be better than nothing though :-) A few people mentioned windirstat, but the functionality is baked right into AS so I never miss it :-) 




 Fair comment on 3 hour play, but on a 30 minute sitcom...? 

The ideal format for a 30min TV programme is no bloody adverts at all! 




 It's really sad, but kinda inevitable, that the first and most earnestly discussed point of this thread is the cost of treatment. Coming from the UK, it seems /so/ strange that this should be so.

This is a really odd question, but what would have happened if you weren't insured? Would the medical system really have refused your son treatment because of something as silly as ability to fund?

Anyway, don't want to detract from your original post. Sincere wishes for a speedy recovery. 




 :-) 




 Rubbish!

A carefully, well reasoned argument there ;-) 




 Dunno, 30k miles a year, means you'll probably have done 1/2 a million by then.

The point is that cars kill kids. It's a shame, but it's the truth. Just at the point kids are at their most headstorng and at their least likely to listen to adults, we give them a 2 tonne killing machine and say "there you go, knock your socks off".

Kids think they are great drivers. They are not. They are rubbish. And they need this hammering into them. Realising that you are a rubbish driver is probably the one thing that will keep you alive long enough to stop being rubbish. 




 He's in high school. When he's got a dozen years and a few hundred thousand miles under his belt, I might revise my estimate. 




 Sorry, my friend, but he did noone a favour that day.

1. You were a rubbish driver
2. You were well over the speed limit
3. He effectively told you to "carry on, sonny"

This time you were lucky. Next time your inexperience might kill someone. 

Cop FAIL. 




 Check the in car footage from Nando's and Hamilton's cars - it was a pretty dangerous move from both drivers and a reprimand was a fair penalty.

Tough luck on Webber that 3 in a year means an automatic penalty, but them's the rules and it's hard to argue with them (even though, personally, I thought it about the best part of the race :-/ ) 




 you're a cunt if you only tip 10 percent

Or not from the US... Tipping 30 or 50% of the meal cost? Mental! 




 Couple of things to note:

1. I always start out writing a select statement that returns the rows that I want to modify, and then changing it to an update. Paranoia always wins :)
2. MySQL has a not well known startup flag that disables unqualified delete or update statements (i.e. where you've forgotten the "where" clause). Amusingly, it's "--i-am-a-dummy" :)

Otherwise, this made me spit my tea on my keyboard. Certainly, an IT guy's idea of horror - give me hairy monsters and vampires any day!

 I Am The Resurrection - The Stone Roses

Anything else and you're not thinking straight ;-) 




 My wife has had ITP for the last 3 1/2 years after she started bruising for no reason. Her platelet count dropped down to  10k when she was first admitted and bounced around for a couple of years, following her various treatments.

We've managed to avoid any serious interventions (it's /always/ possible to drag your feet instead of going under the knife!) so it's really been an inconvenience rather than a serious illness. As her doctor said to her: "You're ill, not dying."

For the last 12 months she's stayed above 30k unaided and has managed to avoid any trips to hospital for IVIG and, even better, she's just started mountain biking again (with a helmet!)

Best of luck to you and, from my experience as a partner of a sufferer, please remember not to let it own your life - even if it never goes away, you can live a more or less normal llife. Oh, and don't be too quick to have bits chopped out ;-)

Hope the financial aspect is OK for you. We're UK based, so at least we don't get a bill at the end of each month!

 Fair, but any company that's charging that much for such a small amount of labour would get grumpy customers. I know I would be pretty unhappy as I would be certain that I'd been ripped off on the installation charges! 




 On the day this was released, my then girlfriend and I noticed that the cover image was a painting held at a museum in Manchester (UK, to avoid confusion). We immediately skipped lectures and went to find it.

In short, it was in storage but the nice lady at the museum desk was slightly surprised that a few people had come in that day asking about the same obscure painting.

Still think fondly of this with my uni years. It's always been a favourite of mine and I still think it's Weezer's best album... 




 Interesting story, but $300k/yr for installing kitchens...? Are you quite sure they were making a profit?

My domestic kitchen cost me about $2k to have installed (in the Uk) and took a few days (big kitchen!)... Certainly someone asking that kinda money isn't going to be doing many domestic jobs here! 




 I challenge anyone placed in a situation where green means success to /not/ utter the immortal:

 I use Tasker to only allow specific apps to rotate the screen. Sorted for me.

Also, never rotate when powered - I read on my side in bed so this sorts that too as the phone is usually powered. 




 Kinda agree, but notice how supermarkets sell a 4-Pinter, but these are /always/ 2 litres from more expensive shops (convenience stores, filling stations etc) because 2 litres  4 pints so they can charge higher prices for less product.

If 4-pinters were banned tomorrow, no one would notice that we were paying the same for less.

Conti tyres (Germany)

Plenty of other options out there that you can use on your own doorstep, even in poor, third-world America where you don't have HopeTech on your doorstep ;-)

Buy local! Support these businesses! 




 Too much good to mention it all: the drunk odd couple, napkins, the world's greatest speech, plenty of real emotion and some awesome acting.

It takes a brave man to make the whodunit part of a Sherlock story incidental to the episode, but it worked very well. Top notch writing and a first class screenplay.

The best thing about Sherlock is that you never know what you're going to get each week. If I wanted predictability, I'd watch Murder She Wrote ;-)

 




 Depends on school - ours in uk has cheapest possible uniform that costs peanuts from the supermarket. Even the kit with the school logo on comes from Tesco and is super cheap!

School uniform FTW as both parent and child. 




 Not sure if serious, but my gym is silent (well, no music anyway) and most people wear 'phones so they can choose their own pain :-)

I have some custom moulds for my Etymotics that block out everyone else and allows me to curse and complain in complete isolation. Recommended. 




 Great idea. Thank heavens the UK only has one major city that we can stuff all of this great investment into, otherwise it might look like we're only capable of making major capital investment south of Milton Keynes...

Pah. 




 Ah, yes. That's very true. I'm making the assumption that in the US, "shoulders" work like they do on UK motorways - that is, they are reserved for emergency vehicles and / or breakdowns. They should not be routinely driven in.

Interestingly, on more and more busy sections of the UK motorway network, the hard shoulder (as it's called in the UK) is being opened up to flowing traffic by use of special signs above that clearly indicate when you can and can't drive in these lanes. In addition, refuges have been built so if you break down, you can park in one of these. Obviously, if you can't make it to one of these, you must stop on the regular hard shoulder, which is closely monitored by automated camera and will automatically switch traffic away from this lane to avoid the blockage.

Not ideal, but we have too many cars and not enough lanes :/ 




 Lot of swearing, anger and gun references, so not sure if you're rational. Still...

Yes, merge-in-turn does work. By having everyone evenly merge in whilst making use of all available road, the traffic backlog is kept in a smaller section of road, this avoiding it from backlogging to the next big intersection and causing a cascaded traffic jam.

Obviously it only takes a few muppets that think they know better to block the merging traffic and the queue becomes worse...and said drivers will always blame this on the merging traffic because they are always right, and therefore the others are wrong.

Grow up, chill out and expand your knowledge and experience on the road. There's no such thing as a fully educated driver :-) 




 Looks like you've burnt a fair few of those fake internet points, so not sure if "swimming against the tide" hasn't just turned into "being downright wrong" 




 Called "zip merging" and it helps to keep traffic flowing by avoiding stalls and minimising queues backing up into other parts of the network. Good practice :-)

Shame most truck drivers here (UK) equate this with pushing in front of their disabled grandma in the queue at the theatre :-/
 




 OK, hard shoulder is fair. But I've seen trucks do this when two (legitimate) lanes merge into one and they've decided that 1 mile from the merge, everyone should be in the inside lane so they block the outside lane.

They should read the bit in the book about zip merging...and then go fuck themselves too :-)  




 No, that was Piz Gloria on the Schilthorn in Switzerland. 




 Fair comment...except that by not liking iTunes (and I really, really can't stand it) this excludes me from both the iPods and iPhones, which both insist on using iTunes and only iTunes for updates and media activities.

So I have Android and I use other media sources (Amazon and Google) for music. Oh, and as I've not bought into the rest, I never bothered buying a Mac either.

Sorry Apple, my Android plugs into anything and is trivially easy to get stuff on and off it without the need for crapware. Your insistence on a closed ecosystem keeps me 100% outside it and thus it will remain. 

And this all begins and ends with fucking iTunes... 




 Your comments are fair but I suspect that you may have a biased view of things (sadly, like me, simply posting on this story gives this away :-)

My wife, brother and both parents were bored silly and while I enjoyed it (it /is/ doctor who after all!) I could see its flaws. 

The episode did jump around a lot and where others have said was because it was too short, I think was because they tried to do too much in a short time resulting in a flawed presentation (too rushed *and* too confusing depending on your level of series immersion)

All I'll say is that my wife has says that she has no interest in the next series and I've got a right bloody task ahead of me to persuade her otherwise. At least I've got a few months!

Perhaps regenerations should be either left out of the Xmas specials or (perhaps better still) done right at the start so that the new actor gets a good run at it. 

Ho hum, I like burning imaginary internet points :-) 




 Awesome. So, we've established that while he didn't invent The Internet (this was obviously done by The Elders, as everyone knows) we are in agreement that he was heavily influential in creating the mechanism that most people use to access it.

Now that we've cleared that up, what piece of mainstream technology have /you/ contributed to society...? 




 Sorry guys, but while it may have appealed to Who geekdom, it bombed in our house. Frankly, it was dragged out way too long and once it was apparent that Smith was on his way, I'd have preferred to see it dealt with and get a bit more time in with the new 'un.

Too much geek, not enough story. Is it too late to get Kylie back?

Looking forward to Capaldi though... Guess it's a few months to wait :-/ 




 Err, didn't Rowling's solicitor's wife drop the ball at a dinner party to show off? Not quite sure this should be bundled with mass surveillance...!

 Useful link but as mentioned elsewhere, hardly comparable. I can make a computer out of wood but I'm not really doing that...I'm just shoving modern bits in a wooden case.

Amazing that anyone can actually make such a thing. In fact, I'm amazed by my own (traditional) automatic watch that holds to about 3s per day using nothing more than springs and cogs and shit!

Worth noting that while quartz watches are usually "better" than mechanical ones, they are rarely as collectable nor as interesting. If I wanted a quartz watch, I'd just use my atomically-synced phone :-)

 Actually, much of Clue isn't actually made up on the spot and this line clearly wasn't, but it's very fair to say that those who think quickest do best and that the funniest bits are the off-script parts.

 Nah, they're on their way to becoming little adults. They know when they can challenge us and sometimes, frankly, they're right to do so. I want my kids to be independent and, these days at least, I rarely need to impose my will - they know what's right and wrong.

Exercising this judgement is one of the cool things about parenting.

That said, when needed, my authority is absolute. Rarrr! 




 Tough one, but:

"Bring them up to understand that: a) wrongdoing (even accidental) deserves an apology and b) Your parents' word is law"

I.e. refusing to apologise simply wouldn't happen.

My kids are awesome and generally wouldn't even need prompting in this regard. As a result, they get to do a lot more things with us as there's pretty much nowhere that we wouldn't take them. I love being a parent (most of the time, anyway!) 




 Rock Music Rule #1:
If your guitar solo isn't immediately preceded by "GEEETAR!" then it's not a real guitar solo. 




 True, but if you buy an expensive electrical item that fails in, say, 18 months, wouldn't you have a sensible expectation that the product didn't last a reasonable amount of time?

UK returns law is largely rooted in this concept. If you buy something that costs 10 you have a much lower expectation of longevity than if you bought something for 1000. So if that 1k washing machine fails after 18 months on a 12 month warranty, you'd certainly have a good case against the retailer (not: *not* the manufacturer - you're contract is with the person you bought it from) 




 In the UK, your contract of purchase is with the store you bought it from and it's their responsibility to resolve the issue.

That said, many do back this service off to the manufacturer, which is OK *if* the service is acceptable.... 




 Yes, I've noticed much the same in many (but not all) of the replies on this topic.

 Quick question: what's a "personal day"?

(From the UK - they do things different over here!) 




 I love OK Go's songs....

...but Of The Blue Colour Of The Sky has to be one of the most badly produced albums I've ever listened to. I'm no audiophile, but I actually contacted Amazon because I thought their rip was faulty! I also downloaded a torrent (bad too) and in the end, bought the CD thinking that it can't possibly sound so bad. I was wrong - it does, and I can't listen to it now.

Yes, I'm sure there are artistic reasons for it, but to my ears, it just sounded bloody awful.

Sorry guys. Love the songs, love the videos, but get someone else to produce your albums :-/

My kids (7 and 5) wake at around 7am and play by themselves quite happily or come into see us. We're usually all up having breakfast by 8am (sleeping my life away doesn't suit me) and the day goes from there.

 With a swipe card, steal it, learn to copy signature, use it. In fact, no one I saw in the US even checked the signature anyway, so you probably don't need to bother learning it.

 And they /chose/ to do this!?

Our wedding had the people we wanted at it. About 70ish with a mix of friends and family and I guarantee you that not a single person was there because we "had to invite them". Plenty of family were missing because, well frankly, we didn't want them there.

 My kids' school (UK) doesn't allow fizzy drinks, or sweets in pack lunches. Likewise they don't sell them on site. More or less unlimited fruit though.... :-)

(My kids do get sweets as treats BTW. I'm not running a monetary here... No fizzy drinks though. None of us drink them so they're rarely in the house. The kids would probably prefer something else anyway.)

3) If I'm riding on my own in a place where I deem it to be unsafe to be overtaken, I'll ride in the middle of the road and the car must wait until I say he can overtake. I then move in. I don't allow myself to be squeezed into the verge, and make myself as wide as I need to to prevent it.

And you know, I've had very few problems with (3). Most drivers are content to be told when it's safe to pass and I've possibly saved myself being shoved into the dirt any number of times due to "optimistic overtaking".

As evidence, I present....me! Not dead, too :-) 




 I think millions is probably more in the right area today.... 




 Amazon UK can deliver to a local pickup point (typically a fuel station or convenience store) and you can then pickup your item using ID and a confirmation code at your convenience.

Its called CollectPlus and is a marvellous system for avoiding the wait in all day blues.

FWIW, I only use it for Saturday deliveries - most stuff just goes to my office during the week. 




 I'm still astonished that anyone in the USA has patience enough to sit through the ads!

On the subject of cost, most people in the US have cable / satellite? The number is rising in the UK, but many people (strangely, more so in affluent areas) choose to only get free to air TV and for 150 vs twice that for a basic satellite service, its pretty good value. 

I'd be interested to see how much people pay in the US for a comparable service. I'd be willing to bet that 150 wouldn't go that far.... 
























 Sometimes I don't get geeks, even though I've been one myself for most of my life.

I loved both of the reboot films /because/ they were different. 




 On this subject, does anyone know what became of the cars after they were abandoned? Surely someone, somewhere took a picture (intact or otherwise)... 




 for private plates you have to renew every year and if you don't it reverts back to the original plate number 

Just to be a pedant, this isn't actually true. 

Private plates on /retention/ (that is, not on a car but rather on a piece of paper) have to be renewed annually, but private plates on a car remain with the car for life, or until the owner transfers it away to another car (or retention). If you sell the car, the plates go with it and, in fact, its been known for cheap cars to change hands at inflated prices so the buyer can transfer the plate into his Merc ;-)
 




 Yeah, but have they turned up again? 




 I'm guessing you don't travel so much. Or read. Or anything.... 




 Is it me or has Button's signature been flipped...? 

Can't be as sure about Fred's, but JB's certainly looks backward to me :-) 




 ...or she said no because he was daft enough to spend such a ridiculous percentage of his income on something so trivial! 




 Scots are, by absolute, incontrovertible fact, also British. They can deny it all they want, but it doesn't make it any less true! Scotland is part of Great Britain and (arguably, more importantly) also part of the United Kingdom. Obviously, a good percentage of Scots aren't tremendously happy with this, but plenty are and, as a country, they decided to remain part of the union. 

For myself, I was brought up in Scotland (though I be a sassenach at heart) and though I now reside elsewhere, I'm proud of what little Scottishness I absorbed in my time there.

I have spent many a happy day in Glasgow (in fact, the last time I stayed was in the very hotel being shown on these horrible pictures) and I feel deeply sad for those affected by this. I don't suppose it was anything more than a tragic accident, but that doesn't make it any less awful :-/ 




 How awful :-(

It sounds like the driver was unconscious at the time. Not sure of his condition, but if it were me, I'm not sure I'd want to come back... 




 Errr, it is.

Great Britain, typically referred to as "Britain" includes Scotland and thus Glasgow. Of course you could have also been referring to The United Kingdom and of course that too includes Glasgow (they voted for that and everything!)

Leaving this aside, nasty scenes in Glasgow that I don't think anyone, North or South of the border wants to see :-/ 




 3rd Jesus?

Oh yes, of course. The fat one balances the two skinny ones.

 I think I've stumbled on official Reddit idiot day or something. 

Did I miss an announcement? 




 Not quite sure that Rubens was quite as chilled out as perhaps he came across on the day. This gives a different take on it:

http://www.grandprix247.com/2012/05/10/barrichello-reveals-how-ferrari-forced-him-to-lose-2002-austrian-gp/

In effect, he argued with the team for 8 laps and in the end, they threatened to sack him if he didn't let Schumacher past. Rubens had no choice but concede and I'm amazed at his composure after the race! 




 I'd just like to say that very little of this applies to the EU for the majority of people. The US is simply insane in what people will accept as normal!

I work 40 hours (although I do oversee updates on evenings occasionally). Rarely work outside of normal hours IG I can help it.

I always smile when I see the US referred to as the land of the free...I think this doesn't apply to the inhabitants :-/ 




 Looked OK to me :-) 




 Excellent. Not seen that for years - great watch. 




 Charlie Cooks Favourite Book by Julia Donaldson and Alex Scehffler. I still know it off by heart even though it's been a couple of years since I least read it with the kids!

Highly recommended :-)

 Err, its the 25th November.... Early? 




 Did you notice Maldonado rushing to find an extinguisher to put it out?

No, neither did I... 




 I liked that too - obviously they too agreed that it was a suitable summing up of their season. 




 Have an upvote - Next time get your sorry ass up earlier! 




 Yup, and he's British too.

 Nope. Just nope.

 Well that's it - I'm sticking to Formula 1. At least there's no corruption there....

Oh. 




 There's also pressure building against energy drinks too.... Red Bull might be next!

  Her frustration is matched solely by the fear that this could happen to any one of us.

Nope, not even the smallest chance.

I'm still astonished by what you guys in the richest country in the world have ended up with for healthcare! 




 When "push to pass" meant afterburners!  




 I remember Top Gear talking about some Scandinavian banger racing series that worked to the same system:

You could spend whatever you like on your car, but if a competitor wants to buy it off you, you /must/ sell it for 500 (or similar). Such a system was self regulating, easily policed and kept the series low-cost for everyone.

I like the idea of Vijay walking into the Red Bull garage and buying their car for 250,000 :-) 




 F1 is not a sport. It's a business.

Simple. 




 Name calling? LOL

Here, have a downvote to help you see the error of your ways :-) 
























 I disagree 100% - I thought it was an excellent adaptation of a very challenging (i.e. massive) story!

Eddie's performance was excellent and I wish him many congratulations! 




 $1.5m every week or $43,000 per hour (assuming a 35 hour week - 2 hours every couple of weeks makes this number a touch higher!)

 Question: what rights have they got to terminate your service outright? I.e. if they decide that you are costing them more than you pay them, can they simply cast you adrift?

No trolling or shilling here (don't even live in the US) - just interested... 




 Good quote from British pop star, Robbie Williams when asked if he "looked" when his wife gave birth:

"Yes, it was awful. It was like watching my favourite pub burning to the ground" 




 Couldn't watch it. Gnnnnn, awful! 




 It's a strange thing, but while I was on honeymoon in NZ (I'm from the UK normally!), I popped into a large bookstore in Wellington and there in front of me was a brand new Matthew Reilly book that I didn't even know was coming! It was the first Jack West novel and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it during the rest of our holiday and on the way home. Funny how things like this stick in your mind nearly 10 years later!

If you could bring any under-recognised novel (or series of novels) to the big screen, which would it be? And no, you can't pick your own!

Best wishes from the UK! 




 Too many to mention, but here are a couple that perhaps you've not heard of:

Out of the Sun by Robert Goddard read by Derek Jacobi. Excellent book and superb reading.
(In fact, any of his Cadfael readings too!)

39 Steps by John Buchan read by Jack Davenport (nasty officer fellow from Pirates of the Carribean)

Life on Air - written and read by David Attenborough. Honestly, this is head and shoulders above any others that I have. It's truly excellent and informative.

The Belgariad by David Eddings read by Cameron Byerley

Where Eagles Dare by Alistair McLean read by ??? ( sorry, not useful, but I love both the story and presentation)

There you go...a few to be going on with :-) 




 I have his Hobbit reading - also excellent! 




 Needs moar three wolf moon:
http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B007I4HHOI
 




 Wow, Rosberg did 700km today.

Think about that: 700km behind the wheel of one of the fastest cars in the world...in a single day.

For those in the Uk, Renaults old F1 car broke Richard Hammond in just a few laps...!

Whatever else is said, these guys have the endurance sorted. 




 Heh, I've just reread your comment and that is indeed what you said!

Damn, just woke up and brain must have been addled.

Can I have a downvote for my OP please ? :-) 




 My (UK) grocery delivery gives me a one hour slot, so none of that stupid partisan shit can go on. 

Oh, and the drivers don't handle any payment, are super friendly and helpful and tipping simply isn't necessary.

Sorry, its an archaism.
 




 And the winner of the award for the first moan about engine noise for 2015 goes to....

Get over it. F1 has moved on. 




 Down doobie do down down... 




 Anyone notice that the linked website had a click-through ad before the article and then obscure half of the screen on my phone with another big advert.

Pot, kettle etc. 




 So then, how many teams that skipped the first test have gone on to do well in that year's championship?

Not many, I'd be willing to bet... 




 Hamilton fan. Upvoted.

Nothing like competition ;-) 




 Top tip: Using a cloth, clean the wiper blades with isopropyl alcohol - will smear far less. 




 The normal method is to have a spare set of wheels, so it becomes a simple wheel swap that can be done yourself at home. It doesn't take any more space in the garage either.

Personally, I run steel wheels with winters, so save a little corrosion on the alloys in the winter months. Others I know have bought alloy wheels specifically for the winters, but I'm not that vain ;-) (Also BMW do some really nice looking trims that look excellent on the car)

Recently bought a full set for my wife's Renault Megane - 400 for the set, including steel rims and the absolutely excellent Nokian WR D3 tyres. Highly recommended. 




 Yorkshire here, winter tyres on both cars. 

Why wouldn't you? After all, I just spread the wear over two sets of boots and the winters work better when it's cold even if there's no snow. Obviously when there is snow, you don't get stuck... :-)

Take the long view and it doesn't even cost you any more.

(Note: most of my colleagues run winters now - seems to be becoming more common, at least around here) 




 Interesting thread. Honestly, I think the solution for a lot of the problems on here is simple:

Get new friends.

I have a circle of friends that I've known for many years. When we eat out, sometimes we split, sometimes we don't. We always just know when it works and when it doesn't and its never been a problem.

Note: I don't drink myself, but others do. We just take this into account with a quick bit of mental arithmetic - I've never felt short changed.

Tipping is easy, of course: We don't live in the US, so aren't completely obsessed with it ;-) 




 Never watched Top Gear?

Break down and you'll be left behind. It's just how it is :-) 




 Standard practice would be having a spare tube ;-) 




 Yup, no tube or way to fix a puncture? Stuffing your tyres with leaves, moss or whatever else you might find is a pretty good way to get you home.

Sometimes necessity breeds innovation :-) 




 They were filming a segment for the new series near Skipton. Looks good stuff.

(Source: Me! Was sat with them about an hour ago ;) ) 




 The King's Speech, masterfully delivered by Colin Firth.

Oh, wait. No, the idiotic MPAA gave it an R rating for its language, even though in the UK it was a 12a. Gratified to read that the director refused to re-edit out the profanity for a more commercially acceptable rating.

You have a strange country, my friends... 




 You cynic, you! ;) 









 While the great man is still with us, read (or better yet, listen to) his excellent memoirs, Life on Air. I can think of no more relaxing way to be entertained than to listen to him tell tales of his youth.

Highly, highly recommended.

http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/aw/d/140846750X 




 Pork Scratchings. No question. 




 Or, to give a slightly more positive spin, they get to take some very well loved characters and place them into a different universe to allow us, the movie-goers, to experience how life might be for them if things didn't entirely follow Roddenberry's idealistic path.

Its an interesting idea and one I'm happy to watch play out. 




 Note: my wife saw both new films in the cinema, something that I really struggled with for the latter TNG films.

The hard core purists can hold out all they want, but they won't get it - what they'll get is nothing at all. A franchise cannot live forever without evolution and the recent reboot has, in my opinion, secured Trek for me for a few more years...

Maybe we'll get a new series too :-) 




 Wat.

I'm not sure that many others agree with you there judging by the steamingly high rating on RT (95%).

You are also aware that their choice of an alternate timeline as a plot device actually allowed them (and in fact required them) to make changes to the universe. No more pandering to Spock trying to come to terms with his human side on Vulcan any more ;-)

Anyway, I thoroughly enjoyed them! 
























 BBC:

1) Don't pay Sky is a basic principle

2) Sky Go doesn't work on modern browsers due to legacy Silverlight rubbish. IPlayer works fine.

3) Sky Go doesn't work on my rooted Android phone. iPlayer works fine.

4) EJ (OK, this one is arguable ;-) 




 BBC coverage starts at 7am, so race must be 8am local.

Its /still/ wrong on the official site. Honestly... 




 It bloody well shouldn't be so hard!

Yesterday f1.com said the race was 7am local time (I.e. 7am BST). Today it says 9am!

But it also currently says that qually was 11am to 12noon yesterday when it was actually 9-11!

WTF, have these people never used a clock before? 




 ...and maybe sinking the funds into buying F1 from CVC?

Red Bull F1 World Championship?

Works for me. 




 Why a nominal fee? Flog the teams at full whack and sink the cash into buying F1 from CVC - I see few disadvantages here.

My biggest request for them is to refocus on FTA broadcast. Sky can show it too, but it should be on the BBC too (in the UK anyway ;-) 




 Actually, I'm assuming that long term we'd see RB pull out of racing (Toro Rossi to Renault? RB to Audi?) and they'd be left just running the sport....like they do for loads and loads of other niche activity sports. The Red Bull Air Race series is properly cool and in case you've not checked, the city venues read like an F1 wishlist! 

Who do you prefer? The Red Bull F1 Championship run by someone who has proven track record in actually caring what the spectacle looks like, or the CVC F1 Championship, run 100% to make money for CVC, without exception.

I think I know which seat my backside is sat on! 




 Good for you. Personally, it sounds like a good idea to me. 




 Actually, they /did/ own it but sold to the BBC a couple of years ago... 




 Honest advice - don't worry too much about what everyone else thinks. Please don't crucify yourself every time your kid cries - some people might moan (or tut if they are British) but many will smile fondly and remember their own experiences and possibly even the fact that they were a baby too once...

I recommend books, toys and, if old enough, something to watch. Please /do not/ be tempted to drug your child. I would hope that the opinions of others are not /that/ important to you!

Parting words from a new-parent book I remember reading when we first started out: 

"When flying with young children, the single best thing you can do is have a double gin before you get on the plane. It won't help your child behave any better, but it will certainly help you to survive the experience!" 




 I have kids and the best job in the world isn't going to let me go and do bike rides with them, or let me build sandcastles on the beach. 

I like my holidays, I look forward to them and (because I live in Europe), I get to take them too ;-)

I also enjoy my job, but the job stays at work when I go on holiday. After all, if they knew where I was, it wouldn't be a holiday /anthony_hopkins 




 No, not too advanced assuming that he's up to scratch.

It's pretty gruesome though... Much more so than the film.

Why not read it yourself first? 




 Can't speak about Hammond but May and Clarkson were interesting people to have a drink with. Honestly, not that different to what you'd expect...

Oh, and he never hit me either :-) 




 Actually, I also have no idea of comparative tax levels either :-)

On a salary of about $150000, a UK citizen would pay around 35% tax all-in. 

I seem to recall reading that the US actually pays pretty much the same as the UK per head of population for assisted medical care only, but this is clearly way, way short of universal healthcare.

As a note, I have private health insurance...and if I'm seriously ill, I'd probably use the NHS instead as they are way, way better equipped! 

(Generally, private health cover is only used to skip the queue and avoid waiting times, which can be high on the NHS for some services e.g. hip replacements. Emergency cover is "at need" so if you need to be treated immediately, you'll almost certainly get treated immediately) 




 It's a fair comment, but I'm yet to see many advantages of the US system over the system here in blighty. 

Unless you are a private healthcare provider or drug manufacturer of course ;-)

Genuine question here: would you swap systems and, if not, why not? 




 God damn it your country has some weird priorities - you are one of the richest societies in the world and you charge kids for life saving medicines!!?

Kids pay zero medicine charges here and adults pay a fixed charge, regardless of the medicine.  




 "Ain't she a beautiful sight" 




 TIFU by getting up at 5am to watch the race when I should have just watched the highlights in the evening.

Honestly, you missed nothing by being knocked unconscious. This race sucked :-/ 




 The only thing that sucks more is being Fred.... 




 We had them at our estate in Jan filming a section that I guess will never be seen now.

They were out in the hills in rotten weather from 6.30am until 7.30pm, filthy, freezing and soaking and they had virtually nothing to eat all day until they had got back and completed the other filming that had to be done. 

And after all that, they still chatted to us after they had eaten and exchanged stories over a glass of wine.

If they had been told that there was no food that day, I suspect they'd have been pretty bloody pissed off then as well!

In short, we don't know what happened but I'd give him the benefit of the doubt. 




 Honestly?

Not nightlies. I'm back on stock 5.1 as I find the CM12 nightlies to suffer unbearably from slowdown and memory issues  24 hours after boot. 




 Number 1:

The Larch. 




 I'm quite comfortable enough with my sexuality that I can cope with getting changed in a "girly named" dressing room.

Are you? 




 I'm not quite sure what point you are trying to make here.... 




 Never knew this. 

Question: even though they don't need to, in your experience do they wear them anyway? 




 Actually, I'm semiserious here...

We threw EMC out and replaced it with Compellent about 3 years ago and have never looked back. Its cracking kit and does stuff that EMC are still dreaming about.

We've got about 800TB across 4 arrays now and love it :-) 




 I'd still buy a Compellent instead ;-) 




 Saved for reference :-) 




 Gutted, he's a hero of mine. Rest well. 




 Wow, that's some collection :-) 




 Yeah, read about that. I'm keen to understand what tools are available to me for monitoring my device.... 




 Hmmm, never been too unhappy with CM myself and I'd always prefer to fix a problem than abandon it and walk away.

Still, thanks for the feedback :-) 




 Running recent CM12 nightlies on Nexus 5, I've noticed that over time (24-48 hours) my phone's performance drops so much that it becomes unusable and has to be rebooted.

Like anyone, I've got a reasonable (but not excessive) number of apps installed and it would be good to be able to see if one app in particular is causing it, or whether it's something related to CM12 itself.

Can anyone recommend specific tools for monitoring long term health of Android, specifically memory, CPU usage with a particular focus on resource leakage that might not show up through normal avenues?

Thanks all :)

 Good post. Fancy repeating for Lewis's wins? 




 What elephant? 




 In the UK there have been multiple, upheld court cases where drivers have been prosecuted for crossing red lights (by automated cameras) to let through emergency services vehicles. 

Not our finest hour, and I'm sad to say that if I'm at the front of a set of lights with a camera and the choice is sit tight or get a ticket, I'm turning the radio up a notch... :-/

http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1204944/Driver-gets-60-fine-moving-yard-red-light-let-police-van-999-pass.html

(I'm so, so sorry that this is a Daily Heil article :( ) 




 The first year can be tough, but I promise you that you won't regret it, even for a moment! 




 Sorry, I disagree. This quote:
 "If we don't have a competitive engine in the near future, then either Audi is coming or we are out," said Marko.

...is pretty inflammatory and doesn't really need a whole lot more blowing up.

When did you last hear someone from Williams say this. Or Lotus? Or even Marussia, FFS. Not impressed with Red Bull this year. My six year old son handles defeat better than they do. And he can sulk like a champion too! 




 Note: In the UK, the chances of him driving again any time soon would be pretty much zip. Unsurprisingly, we are somewhat reticent about letting people back on the road if they might fall unconscious at the wheel. IIRC, 1 month if they can find a cause, 6 months (or more) if they can't and therefore can't be sure it won't happen again.

Tough love, but it would be for his benefit, as well as those about him. He could very easily have killed someone there...next time, he might find that he's burnt up all of his luck credits already :-/

Anyone know what the situation would be in the USofA? 




 Apart from me. I'm fucking awesome, me.

(Sorry) 




 Brit reporting in - I always apologise to my car if I hit too big of a pothole. 




 Britain: Damn, we're good at queuing! 




 True, but look on the plus side: UKIP only won one seat!

Every cloud has a silver lining :-) 




 Also works for checking for "live" fibres when wiring SANs :-) 




 33 a race is "not a bad deal"!?

I'd switch sports in an instant rather than pay close to this! 




 Meh, I have a recorder so just watch in the evening when the kids are in bed and I can have some peace and quiet. And, as a bonus, if there's a weather or SC delay, the fast-forward button works... :-)

Only races I watch live are the far eastern ones and only then if they are on the BBC. 




 I find a computer to be indispensable:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=043WEs_6TAo 




 Chris Pratt had something to say on this subject:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkVAAtC1mEA t=43s 




 Update: Lowden finished but was lapped three times by the leaders. 

Alonso was also competing but his shorts exploded at the 15th mile marker. He was, however, upbeat and said that Honda were due to deliver uprated shorts in time for Barcelona.  




 Don't let the internet hit you as you leave... 




 Woohoo! I might be on the telly yet :-) 




 Nope. So much nope. 




 Sweet baby Jesus!

Didn't some kid die after filming something just like this? 




 And I thought I was bad for telling my kids to "man up" when they tell me they are tired during a bike ride!

I reckon I'm the world's best dad now :-) 




 Didn't Kvyat manage to cross the line? 




 Is it me, or are those wheels just downright _wrong_ for the car? They look to me to be the incorrect offset, forgetting the obvious fact that they are clearly too big!

In the UK, at least, they would be illegal as the protrude from the wheel arches and would thus be dangerous to other road users, but especially "soft targets" such as cyclists or pedestrians. 




 Out of all of the terrible things here, this one is the biggest NOPE by a country mile. Given me the shivers just thinking about it. Gnnn... 




 Does anyone have any feedback on how good, technically, this kit is?

Looking at the raincoat and softshells, which are upwards of 100, there's very little information on what they are made from. If I was buying in a shop, I'd probably expect gore-tex or Windstopper type materials at that price....

Obviously, I'd expect the very best here, especially as they are being subsidised by the sponsors' logos ;-) 




 In the UK, never had to have a sick note for anything less than a few days off (honestly, I can remember how long and it's been nearly 10 years since I had more than a couple off in a row).

If I put my manager hat on, I perhaps would get a little grumpy at "Morning After The Night Before" illnesses. Not because of the time off, but more because of the diligent staff that have to pick up the extra work and cover for those who aren't as conscientious.

I'm pleased to say that for the last 10 years I've worked with a great team who wouldn't dream of dropping people in the shit like this, and arguing about the odd sick day here and there would never have crossed my mind.

Treat people like kids and they'll just return the favour... 




 Note: if you can come to work with influenza, you don't have influenza. 




 Quite right too, sir!

All I saw on Sunday was a team *and* a driver who were /so/ excited to win. It was great to see regardless of which team you support.

There were no losers this Sunday.

(Well, ok. McLaren, a little bit ;-) ) 




 *shrug*

I supported Lewis last year, but I'd be lying if I denied that a bit of me wants to see Vettel win with Ferrari.

Just because people support the sport and not necessarily a specific team or driver does not make them less of a fan... 




 Fait comment, but I must refer you back to the governing rule #1 in my original post ;-) 




 Have you tried it on the current release? It tells you that it will stop working soon. And in the dev release it's already disabled.

The problem here is that the rest of the world are moving away from proprietary plugins but Sky aren't. 




 EJ is a special, exclusive feature with the BBC. With a beard ;-)

I'm not quite sure why you bothered to ask the question as your response is basically saying that you've made up your mind anyway. 
























 Yup, I was there for the filming for the last scenes of the film you saw last night and I can't quite get my head around people complaining to the BBC about a promo voiceover.

Pretty sure that Clarkson and co wouldn't give the smallest imaginable shit about it either. 




 Seriously? 




 Nah, it's just a programme about cars where the three blokes who make it are moving on and some other bloke will start again next year. Stuff changes, and it really isn't worth over dramatising. In fact, I'm pretty sure that a BBC trail for Gardener's World or some such would probably fit well with previous comments made by the (now old) team regarding not over dramatising such matters.

Now if you want a /proper/ ending, try the last episode of Blackadder 4...they certainly didn't talk over that one! 




 There /was/ dinner and it was absolutely delicious, actually :-) 




 Woohoo! I was on the telly, albeit in the distance a few times and, depressingly, my thinning hair :-/

Still, was on the last "proper" TG, so pretty chuffed. 




 Good week for that comment, my friend. 




 I think I'd have to agree with his own statement:

He /is/ the best karaoke star in the world.

(Actually, that's not true judging by his Ian Brown-esque hitting of the notes) 




 Err, I have a 1TB SSD in my laptop and have done for well over a year now. Quite cheap now too :-)

Seriously, for general OS use, there is simply no comparison and if you do any "real" work (I'm a DBA) they are 100x quicker than spinning rust.

I get your reliability concerns, but spinning disks fail too and in a laptop are much more sensitive to shocks. Running a regular disk does not mean you don't need to run backups! 




 When you say "fixed", they've actually forcibly uninstalled it before starting the upgrade.... 




 Fair comment on capital, but Germany has a thriving manufacturing economy producing many of the high value goods in high demand in the rest of Europe.

I'm sat here trying to think of one Greek export, and I'm struggling... :-( 




 Question: do testing engines "count" against their allocation? 




 Nah, it was never owned by Lotus.

Lotus did, however, design the TG track layout that has been used since the start of the most recent incarnation.

Wouldn't surprise me if the BBC even had this sewn up tight however... 




 Well it's not on until next Spring, so he'll pretty much get that year.... 




 Looks like a hand-egg to my eyes...

 There's a huge difference in speed between 2G and 3G. Full strength 2G is still likely to be 10x slower than 1 bar of 3G, but on the whole, if you have fringe 3G coverage you are likely to be booted from the cell and thus drop down to 2G resulting in a large drop in connectivity performance. 




 Funny sticker, but why do people consider acquisition of wealth to be the ultimate goal of life?

Personally, I consider personal gratification and happiness to be orders of magnitude more important than wealth and I find that children help me in this. If you can do it without, then excellent too :-) 




 Great write up, ignore the idiots!

One thing that I will add is that 3G networks capacity manage differently to 2G and 4G networks. When a 3G cell manages its capacity, it will tend to kick off devices running at the highest RF output power, on the basis that these are geographically furthest away and therefore most likely to be serviced by another cell.

This works well in a city when there is a lot of overlapping cells, but when you are operating on the edge of a 3G area it actually means that you are more likely to find yourself being bumped to 2G even though your 3G service was acceptably good. 4G does not capacity manage in this way and is a superior network technology, regardless of the speed boost it might bring you. 




 Your explanation was both informative and well written. Please ignore the ignorant and accept from one that likes to learn: this was an interesting post. 




 Congratulations, you will never be more than you are now!

Would you like me to print you an "I am all that I will ever be" certificate to show to your friends? 




 Interesting to see McLaren testing their latest iteration in the background. 

Already looks quicker than the current car... ;-) 




 Glorious! 




 Last year wasn't too good either... 




 Hang on. So litigator sues and loses and the defender pays the lawyers...is that actually possible? 




 Translation: I live in the wrong place for road cycling so the rest of you guys should go to the gym like me instead. 




 Thoroughly enjoyed both the first album (Megalithic Symphony) and new follow-up (Run) from Awolnation. 

Strangely, it's one that the whole family like, so it's become a road trip favourite. 




 Don't mean to disagree, but while most cars in Europe /are/ manual, many premium marques are predominantly automatic. In fact, when I was shopping last year, finding a manual 5 series was nearly impossible.

(Bought an auto anyway - hey, the residuals are better :-) 




 Yup. Them's the breaks. 




 OK, run the sums on what I currently get:

52 x 1 (I assume that they included Saturdays at this time and I don't work Saturdays)
32 (annual holiday allowance)
8 (public holidays)

Total: 92 days
At 6 days per week, 15.3 weeks holiday

3 months? Pah - wouldn't even get out of bed for 3 months' holiday ;-) 




 It /is/ a gif. Accurate too.
