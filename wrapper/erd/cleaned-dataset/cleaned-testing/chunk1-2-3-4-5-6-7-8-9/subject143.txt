 Haven't encountered this issue on PS3 what system are you using? 




 It has updated for me on PS3, what console are you on? 




 PS3 update is now available to download not sure about other consoles? 




 Yeah not like he moved his stick to place his hip fire reticle perfectly on the guy or anything, sure it added a tiny adjustment but not exactly game breaking stuff. 




 I completely agree everyone here seems to be completely over exaggerating it don't know why you got down voted.

 Your laugh is contagious  




 You are actually informed when you are spotted, you hear a small sound to notify you that you've been spotted just throwing that in there. Obviously it's easy to miss it with all the explosions and gun fire though so.

 Ellie what have I told you! 




 Source? 




 Ah that's too bad, was looking to play a nice DT rush server :-( 




 Tried clicking the link for your server, says page doesn't exist? 




 It's interesting  
























 Thank you I'll have to do a bit if reading about it see if it's something I'd be interested in  




 I've thought about the army but I'm sure my girlfriend and parents would kill me before I joined hahaha but I am going to look into it, as an engineer in the army how long do you get deployed for if at all?  




 Thanks i'll have a look into some of your suggestions, also i'm in the UK so i don't think that codeacademy is much use to me here. 

 




 Basically i'm in a foundation year of an engineering course at the moment and i'm really, really struggling with all the maths and i'm dying to do some practical work and actually learn something, all this maths just seems like it's a waste of time and leading to nowhere, i feel like i'm probably going to fail this course, but the thing is i really enjoy the idea of engineering, fixing things particularly, is there a course out there that judges you based on practicals rather than maths tests?

I've thought about apprenticeships and gaining experience through work but i have no idea where to start, i'm young and have never had a job, but i really want this to work also i'm in the UK so if you can point me in the right direction on where to start looking that would be fantastic, i just feel all a bit lost at the moment.

Thank you in advance. 




 One more and it would be a dugtrio 




 This is just wrong man, why does that even exist, you have to be pretty messed up to make a subreddit like that... 




 Thank you i appreciate your advice, i think it's more her decision than mine but i'll be there for her either way, thanks this is making me feel alot better about how i can help her out and what she'll be going through. 




 Yeah i don't particularly like the fact that we have to do this but being young and still in university it would not be good for us or the child to be brought up in a situation where we have no time to look after it, and i will support her no matter her decision if she chooses to keep it, i will discuss it with her and if she still feels like she can't go through with it, i'll be there for her, and thank you for your out look and opinion it's nice to have another point of view :-) 




 Thank you, i'll remember that for next time. 




 Ah i didn't notice that i'll remember that for next time, and i've looked and don't think i can edit in a serious tag, lets just hope the people of reddit are respectful! 




 Thank you so much for sharing your experience, i'll show her this tomorrow and hopefully give her some peace of mind, i know it's going to be hard for her and i'm going to be there every step of the way with her, this is defenitly what we want we've spent alot of time thinking about it together, and yeah her family would go crazy if they knew about it and she doesn't need that extra stress, thank you again i'll show her this tomorrow (she doesn't use reddit) but she might PM you from my account if that's alright and again thank you so much!  




 Sorry it's my first time posting, not really sure how to add it?

 Thanks I'll check them out :-) 


































 I didn't down vote anything if that's what you're accusing me of? 




 Those fractal guides are really going to help me thank you! 




 Thanks this really helps I know an important part of he mesmerized in groups is reflects, thank you.  




 Thanks I'll go have a look. 




 That's an axe in his other hand, no idea who he is. 




 Thanks but I'm looking for more mesmer specific tips, not my first level 80 but thank you anyway :-) 




 Just hit 80 on my mesmer just looking for any general tips for dungeons, I've read the pve sticky on the gw2 forum, but any tips that are not well known that may help? 




 That makes it okay then she is registered with the NHS thank you I'll let her know today about it, yeah I've told her that myself, her mother especially though is very strict on these matters though, but like you said she wouldn't let her daughter suffer over it. 




 Yeah I know but neither of us have had any other sexual partners, so I'm not completely convinced either way STD or not she needs to get it checked and treated, just trying to find the right place to do that. 




 I didn't say it would be a bad idea just as she hasn't lived here long she doesn't have a personal doctor to go to, otherwise that would be our first option. 




 This does cost money though right as I checked the website it's pretty pricey, neither of us really have the money at the moment to be paying for treatments and tests and such, I'm going to have to try and convince her to see someone when she's home in Greece she's just scared of her parents knowing about it and would like to get tests and treatment before she leaves (Which I don't really think is possible given she's leaving Friday) but thank you for the suggestion, I will give it thought I don't want her problem to get worse because she's embarrassed. 




 I know that but i'm still confused by this, not sure how i can i apply this knowledge to work out how many more electrons than protons it has? 




 Thank you i found the equation for it earlier can't remember it off the top of my head 




 My girlfriend has found some small lumps on her vagina, she said it's itchy, and painful and she said it burns when she pees, not sure what it is, she's a student here in the UK and doesn't have a doctor to go to, also she's going back to Greece this friday, she wants to get checked as soon as possible, does anyone know where she can go to get this done for FREE? Really need your help reddit :-( She's in sheffield if that helps. (Not sure if this is the right sub for this direct me if i'm wrong)

Edit: Okay guys sorry i seem to have found a place we can go to, sorry to bother you /r/sex !

But just in case any suggestions would be nice as we will have to make an appointment and not sure when she will be able to get checked, do you guys know of any walk in centres? 




 also if anyone can help with this too If a heater uses 17kJ of energy in 5.2s, what power is it?  




 If the total charge on an ion of oxygen is -3.2 x 10^-19C, how many more electrons than protons does it have? Not sure how to work this one out. 




 Ah thank you so much the anwser is 2 it's simpler than i thought! 




 If the total charge on an ion of oxygen is -3.2 x 10^-19C, how many more electrons than protons does it have? I'm not sure how to go about working this out? Any help would be appreciated! Sorry if this seems easy to you guys. 




 What's your story? 




 http://imgur.com/4QiA1Go sorry about that hahah forgot to paste it in the original comment thanks.
 




 Hey just got my first lvl 80 last week, been saving all my mats to make Twilight :-)

Thank you so much it would mean alot to me to win this! Praise be unto Zommoros! 




 I don't know the horns do look like rytlocks however his armour looks different now, all leafy and mordremothy. 
























 Potion sellah i'm going into battle and i want only your strongest potions. 




 That's probably information i should add, well anything between 20 - 30 per person for a full course, no preference really on cuisine. 




 Somewhere that has some good food and a nice calm atmosphere would be perfect any suggestions? Maybe a place to go out for a drink afterwards too.

Edit: Lots of suggestions guys i'll have to have a good look at all of them thank you to all of you! :-) 




 Yeah but if this happens the drop rates would probably go down even more, and we don't want that now do we, Rotomaniac? 




 Ah thanks, i thought so, would be nice if it did change the appearance. 




 Okay so i equipped my new sight through the modify menu but when i get in game my M1G has the original iron sight still attached? Are the sights just for stats or do they actually change? 




 I thought he meant the camera was in the clock, and the dad found out by seeing it was dirty taking it down and cleaning it, only to notice a camera in there, i watch too many movies... 




 My school had a bomb threat, one of the students phoned up and said they have placed a bomb somewhere in the school, everyone was evacuated onto the yard (Which was about 50 feet from the buildings, what good that would do) the police were then called and they had the canine unit searching the school for the bomb, they found nothing everything was fine i think they found the student and removed him from the school this was in the UK, all in all i didn't mind, i missed all my classes that day, thank you bomb kid... you're the bomb.

Found a link here if anyone is interested, i don't go to the school anymore. http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/teenager-charged-over-broadgreen-international-3352147 




 Yeah I sent mine straight away as soon as I found out who my match was guess I'm just a little impatient and excited to see what I get! 




 I still haven't gotten anything :-( looks like tixx skipped my house this year. 




 Where did you get this information that they will cost 400 gems a piece?
 




 TittyAttack.com ... 




 I feel like this system could be easily abused, what if there was multiple scouts on one map by multiple i mean like 30, what if some player just likes making random markers at places for no actual reason, it is a tough issue to solve.

I was thinking something like the commander tag, but for scouts, the tag allows their text in map chat to show up in a different colour to the others, a scout tag, it would also allow people to see which towers have scouts, due to it showing up on the map much like the commander tag, not sure of the pricing of this tag tho, maybe 100g like the old commander tag? 




 Damn, I'm making those Oreo truffles later, thanks Kevin! (Who knew Asura were such good cooks) Amazing job guys! 




 I feel the elementals would be alot better if they were made permanently summoned until death then they go on cd, much like necros felsh golem, it would be sooooo much better, this along with the lesser elementals too. 




 You're right it doesn't feel like you're a plague cloud, probably the best way to do this would be to make the cloud much larger, the actual size of the aoe area, although this would make you a much larger target, it would still be very cool and feel alot more like an elite through a simple cosmetic change. 




 turns out it's a Sovereign - Victoria, Old Head and not a 5 hahah makes it alot easier for me to research now, thank you for your input really helped narrow my search i'm not good with coins. 




 Hey guys so my SO's parents have a bunch of these http://m.imgur.com/a/QyGJ2 I was just wondering if you guys could give me some info on how much they're worth today and who or where I should sell them to get the best price thank you! (If this is the wrong subreddit for this type of post please direct me). 




 Yeah I always check things for myself would never ignore something simply because it was down voted and thank you I didn't mean to accuse you of accusing me hahah. 




 Ah yeah I would never do that without first checking the link. 




 Don't have to worry about dungeons all classes are viable, while some may be better than others when it comes to damage or utility, you can be useful as any class if played right, so play what you enjoy, I had the same problem as you, I forced myself to level to 80 even though I was bored, can't say it wasn't worth it once I hit 80. 




 Thank you! 
























 I wonder what they look like without the black fur around the eyes. 




 You get about 7 levels per craft to 400, too lazy to work it out  




 No.

Source: I've checked 




 A pen and paper, easiest method. ;) 




 Yeah perhaps you're right about that, I do hope things work out for you two, and don't take advice from anyone who says "End it now" no one can understand the situation better than you or your SO do, although sexting with my GF does feel a little silly when I'm not in the mood. 




 I've had a period like this for about a month some time ago when I wasn't feeling good about my performance in the bedroom and my confidence in general when it came to sex got quite low because of it and anything to do with sex such as sexting and talking about it just brought me down because I knew I couldn't perform in the bedroom, I don't know if this might be the case with him but perhaps he's just not feeling as confident as he used to be?  




 Hahaha that sounds ridiculous thank you for the info I'll be steering clear of those two. 




 Thanks for the offer but I'm not really familiar with the Wirral and I'd probably end up getting lost just trying to find my way around haha 




 Finally looking to start learning how to drive, any one have any schools they can recommend, not sure of the reputations some have. 




 No, that's a tree 




 You've hit the nail on the head here i guess what it is that i'm most scared of was like you said the guy being better at this than i am, i feel like i would take that the wrong way and knock my confidence, it's not an easy decision to make, losing all control and allowing this to happen.

The part you explained about stepping back has really gave me a new perspective on how to look at it, thinking of it that way i don't get as angry as i would normally, i guess i picture myself in the point of view of the other guy and that's not the best thing to do.

I do need to work on my own insecurities and overthinking the situation and i think i can do it, you've helped me out more than you realise but i know i'm not going to change over night, but at least i have a new perspective to think about, thank you. 




 Admittedly i have had a bad day today so perhaps it seems a bit exagerated, but i don't think your comment is fair, just because i feel this way now does not mean i can't change my outlook by working on it. 




 Yeah i've thought about that but at the same time i don't want to hold her back from new experiences or myself for that matter! 




 Thank you for your reply, I'll talk to her about this later on, but i feel like she'll just think i'm simply asking for this for my own pleasure rather than to help with the jealousy, I will try to explain it to her as best i can and hopefully she will understand.

But what if even after my experience i still feel too jealous, i would feel absolutely horrible denying her the experience that i had, and i'm sure she would be upset if i did that after her allowing me to have a threesome with two girls. 




 So my SO is interested in group sex and i'm not entirely against it myself, but even just the thought of another guy touching my SO makes me angry, like shaking with rage angry, and even if she jokingly says something about another guy to purposely annoy me it REALLY pisses me off.

So i guess what i'm asking is how can I get over the jealousy so we can try new things, i know i'm not ready now but how can i make that first step? 




 Has there been any mention of what new weapon the necromancer will get? I know we've seen a few in the trailer what else haven't we seen? 




 Yeah it's good imo, I enjoyed it at least and found it a pretty interesting look into something people rarely think about when they go to Aquariums or Zoo's.  




 Source? 




 Rest In Peace in peace photographer 









 Lots of people i've talked to are reccomending this place, had a look myself it's looking like this might be the place!
 




 REPOST GUYS REPOST ABORT MISSION 
























 What are some of the red flags you talked about? 




 Turn off melee attack assist, promote skill target and autotargetting, they really mess with the gameplay! 




 I feel mesmers portal will be amazing for quickly moving supply back and spawn some npc's then quickly use the portal again grab some more, I think it'll be interesting seeing how everyone's playstyles will change and adapt to the new game mode and map. 




 Thieves, engineers and mesmers are the main ones I see roaming in most games. 




 Who would let such a small child ride such a powerful beast? 




 I did it once, my girlfriend stills laughs about it because it was so unexpected. 




 The cool down is tied to the ram not the player if I remember correctly. 




 Go to your bank and preview some armour find some you like and just Google where to obtain them easiest way to get a look you like. 




 You have to realise that not everyone is doing it to gain an advantage, some are just playing with their friends, but it can get annoying I agree. 




 I like to join groups with ele's, guardians and warriors so I can be sure that I'll get some might. 




 Woah that kid looks like Brad Pitt 




 () I want gerrrrrmmmss 




 Ah I see, thank you for the clear explanation! 




 Can you explain what the VIP system is/ does? 




 Last rank of what? Is this pvp or wvw or what? 




 AH, STAYIN' ALIVE!

 Created a new character after the update and was surprised to see the new lay out for the proffessions came with the update!

 Nice find looks like you could be right; I like the sound of the leaked skills i really hope the bow is a decent weapon. 




 As a level 52 you're at a major disadvantage, yes you get boosted to 80 but your stats will not be as high as an actual level 80 with full gear, you really have no chance until you're level 80 yourself and have your gear and traits, just run with the zerg try and stay out of the way and toss some grenades in there, also if you're getting chased Rocket Boots, turn around Net shot then run for your life and don't forget to use Caltrops on toolkit to slow them down and your block as you run away (If you think they can still hit you). 




 Some mini games would be nice, like the ones from that place i can't quite remember right now.

The firing range and shield/sword training, i mean they can help with reaction times, they could even make the trainer for sword training a giant golem that puts up a bubble shield so it wouldn't look silly with a few people doing it at the same time, it's relevant to pvp at least. 




 Was this kid called spongebob?
