 Watched a doc of a family using a pot with an iron upside down, with a pot of water on top of the iron to heat bath water (along with 2 coffee pots and misc other things).
 




 Gel medium? I thought they used mod podge for this, can I use hair gel? 




 If it means a lot to you - adtr
Stay out - hit the lights
Siren - the dangerous summer
Just stay - strange bacation
The space between, and probably a lot of other songs by Valencia
A lot of Brighten songs
Thing left to lose - transit 




 Hell yeah. Used to love this band but forgot about them. 




 Not my type but you'll do fine on a dating site. Pictures are fine. GO FOR IT 




 Yes! Saving this post. I know they'll say omega 3 and vitamin b rich food but curious for further input.

Side note: gluten makes me very depressed. 




 This is so intriguing and scary. Does he sound smart or like he knows algorithms? Heard he had an IQ of 110. Handwritting? 




 seriously, is it really that hard to just fuck Amanda ahhaha 




 Gonna start using this instead of Go Fuck Yourself. 




 I didn't pick up on her intentionally wanting a baby. The scene with Derek's sister is made me think she wanted to leave her family and move in with another family, like Derek's or something. But the theory here makes more sense for the show. Fuck, I hope not though. 




 So much always happens in an episode, I feel I have to comment while watching the episode to actually convey everything I want to say... But that's not going to happen.

Love Lip's stuff still, I really don't think they're going to get him caught in some way like the others... Unless this is the last season - interesting way to end the show for good is if they put everyone in jail or suicide. I think it's becoming more clear that his storyline will be to enter the professional world and succeed, even if his luck pisses viewers off

Definitely want to kill Sammi. At the same time, I thought she was going to kill herself after she told Ian he was great and going to be okay. Her, Ian, and Charlie could all be in the running for a suicide ending, hopefully not. I think there's going to be a crazy season finale of a very smart death brought upon by Mickey and Fiona, maybe the rest of the Gallagher squad as well.... BUT at the same time, like Lip said last episode, Carl going to jail was inevitable at some point, and Ian getting caught is as well. It was something they were responsible for, Sammi just bridged the gaps I guess.

Don't get Debbie pregnant. Don't. Urghh. Still, I do like the relationship and don't think having sex was wrong for her. Yes, she'd still young, but at least it's in a caring, healthy relationship, plus they seem to be best friends which is most important (i think) during teen sex.

Fucking Fiona, okay, the kiss was in a specific context but just... be a prude for an episode or something.

Hate commenting on Frank but he's so in love, even if it's a friend kinda love. This makes me upset, but happy at the same time. I think the doctor dies at the end of the season, showing that Frank can experience heartbreak and sadness -- I don't think she'll be cured or they'll call her with a fake positive or anything like that. 




 No question she's going to die. I bet it'll be in the finale, a long, smart plan by Mickey, Fiona, maybe even Frank and Lip. It's gonna be good. 




 a guy putting his dick in your vagina and thrusting, then cumming. then you both leave. 




 still have it?  




 aside from pills, eating right, exercise, melatonin, not laying around in bed or the room where you sleep, keeping TV and the phone away for a couple hours before bed, and try youtube meditation or night time sleep videos with soothing sounds.

This is easier said than done, I tend to just take various pills (ambien, a benzo, otc sleep aids, melatonin, and tylonel pm/nyquil). 




 Lol really cheap. Like $0.25/milligram. 




 Broke and friendless. 




 Don't really have a favorite band anymore. I mean, there are a few bands I like but I know they're nothing groundbreaking and their music isn't anything to move mountains. Haven't been to a show in forever either.... 




 Walls. So they could talk and move and kill people. 




 and assembly line. 




 and cotton gin. 




 Yes. The light bulb. 




 Well that's no good. 




 Why! I feel that'd be perfect 




 Okay I'll probably take the adderal tomorrow and hit the gym then write my paper ;) 




 What is your normal day like? How do you handle weather and physical strain/lethargy? 




 Really interesting thread, the comments completely show the opinions of the males and the feelings of the females. Emotionally, as a girl that's been through this, i would be upset too because I tend to have the "I need it all" mentality with guys and friends, and I can't always get over a hook up if it's not someone I met that night, and have to face as a friend/acquaintance. I know it's bad and not right to do it to him, but it's just my emotions.  Now on the practical side, I would love to say I can move forward and he should not feel bad about my interpretation and doesn't need to apologize. 

I think it's best to both remain practical and show hints of remorse for not being on the same page, as well as learning that girls are weird and emotional. 




 My goal is half bakery half community room--music, art classes, craft shows, etc. Midwest is a little far though 




 amen 




 Well, I don't know really. I think that's you're part, you have to get creative. Services don't really require much capital versus producing goods. Haven't you ever heard of the red paperclip trade? Maybe get certified in a trade, like software, design, etc and begin in that way. Good luck. I really say this because I fee the same way and really don't think working for someone is right for me and can't seem to find a company and position that I will work well with. I want to live my life combining all the things I love and be my own leader, I don't know how far working for a company will take me as far as natural fulfillment. I plan on (hopefully) opening my own food business, then expanding to greater things.

Where do you live? I could use a partner... 




 Be your own boss. Create a business, create things, help create. Travel. 




 It depends. Sometimes I'm in the room I grew up in for 15ish years or in a wide open area like a barn without any furniture. I never seem to be in multiple locations in the dream though, it doesn't change settings. Usually I'm alone or with one other person, although I have had a couple where I was with strangers.. When I say strangers I literally mean people I cannot recognize, have no idea what there name is and feel like I have never even met them in passing in my life. 

No. They feel like they last FOREVER which is terrible because most of them really scare me and I feel I'm trapped. ill fall asleep and then wake up after and see my clock only said 1/2 hour has passed. Feels more like 12 hours in the dream. 




 do you have any ties to St. Pete, Florida?  




 So do you like... Wanna be friends.. Or... Uh..
 




 Both sound right up my alley. Much appreciated. 




 I think i read this but will try again, thank your 




 Thank you. A lot of titles listed are books I've heard but never seemed to get around to. 




 Really? I've heard of it but figured it's script only. I'll search it.

You use it? 




 I just don't understand or believe in meditation. Isn't meditation just relaxing and trying to clear the mind for a while. I've tried that, I've done some YouTube videos, just doesn't seem like something that could change my life for more than half an hour. I don't know. 




 Yes! Just reserved both. Should be good. 




 If you're not covered in flour, you're not a real chef.

Or may it's the opposite. 




 Well well well, this is a great question and discussion. I have my popcorn ready. 




 Judging an animal competition for Legos. 




 See you there 




 You can't take out a loan? What about shadowing someone?

Seems like you're doing well and happy (to an extent). Good for you. Waiting wouldn't be terrible... 




 Yeah I love that little area in Snyder 




 I'd talk with them and learn if they have the same mannerisms and emotions as we do. 




 A weird feeling when you have what you think is a great idea and there are already a few similarities within the area. It's like discovering America only to find it was already discovered. 




 a tomato because i'm controversial and kinda sweet. 




 Just create a station on Spotify and you'll get all the related bands that are popular in the genre right now. I also really like Major League. 




 Probably french fries with mayo and ketchup. I could eat them for every meal, every day. Plus, there are so many different varieties and cuts of potato! 




 I love fiber one cereal so I understand what you're talking about. I think bars or those cookies would be the death of me so I don't eat them. I'd keep them out of your cupboard because they might end up harming you. Drink a lot of water though. I also know that if you always eat a lot of fiber, your body gets used to it and you stop shitting so much.

are you eating less and feel more full in general? if so, it's probably good that you're getting extra fiber. just cut back a little bit.

I love chips like corn chips or tortilla chips with salsa. I also have a very unhealthy obsession with bagels and french fries! Gotta cut those out completely. 




 Grab generic food from aldis or save a lot of something like that. Maybe a bag of chips for every 2 people. Cook something, like a homemade dip or brownies. Invite people to bring something if they'd like or plan on making smores in the microwave or something silly... like a taco party, or a nacho party.

games like cards against humanity, charades, apples to apples are cool. and of course drinking games like have you ever, truth or dare, etc. are fun (even if you're not drinking). 




 if you like pop punk:
transit, the story so far, state champs 




 I don't mean to be offensive or anything when I say this, but it feels like you're mentally retarded. At the same time, it makes me feel like I'm the world's biggest philosopher. You have short trains of thought. You will go through a phase of intense laughter and feel your eyes squish together.

Then I usually nap. 




 I'venever heard of that in my life.

I make amazing stromboli though. 




 Intriguing! Can you do a quick run down of what Ayahuasca is and what it's able to do? I feel I read about this once and someone posted it was the worst thing they're ever done but holds great power. 




 Stop trying to force something that isn't there. He's not the one, but a significant person in your life you should keep around. 




 Okay, I get what youre saying. I wouldn't market it as "art therapy" and i doubt we would get to the point with real therapists and correct procedure, etc. Art classes, yes, that is more correct. 




 I feel a lot of people have mixed feelings on indian dishes, which tend to be mostly vegetarian. Not sure about that. I want to stay away from pasta because I feel it's so hard to get right. The sauces are something I take very seriously as an Italian-American. 




 Yes and no. Maybe I should say Art AS therapy in this case. I was thinking more out loud and probably should have tweeked my wording before posting. My idea is simply to make art, do artistic things, get people engaged, give them something to do, maybe learn a new skill. I'm an art therapy minor and have friends within the program that teach classes that do not call it art therapy but hold the general idea over the classes they offer -- like shrines, mandala work, etc.

Writing this quickly on almost a dead battery so apologies for grammar and what not! 




 I haven't had this account for 2 months, yet I've gotten 2 months of Reddit Gold so far. I see no perks about it. If there was a better tradeoff, I probably would do it. It'd just me a symbol for our connection, this time and place, who I am and who you are. 




 whoa, that one is firey! Thanks for the knowledge! 




 Checked briefly his history and did a search that didn't show up with anything. Wasn't until now that I checked the universal block page and even though i scrolled down alphabetically, I did not scroll down ALL the way and see his name. Also now found more dirt on him. Filed a claim with Paypal and hope to get my money back. 




 Sports hold more meaning than... I don't even have an example what girls talk about because all I hear is blah blah blah. 

I'm a female btw. 
























 I think there's like 7 seasons... 




 My mind is blown. 




 construction, delivery men (food and furniture, etc), coutbound/inbound call center or telemarketing. sell drugs, underwear, flip free stuff you see on the side of the road for money, or thrift store flipping /r/flipping 




 I like answering questions too. I love posting here but don't get many questions. How do you relieve stress/anxiety? 




 3. 




 Mturk 




 Fourth wall? 




 Meds. They have me a little clearer view, enabling me to kind of "self help" myself how a therapist may.... If that makes sense.

Hated therapy. 




 3 




 I was obsessed with coffee, stopped drinking it when I started antidepressants and other pills. Sucked but now I don't drink it at all. Maybe once a month. 




 And your favorite? Love(d) opiates. 




 Depression, anxiety, mania. Low social interaction, body issues, abuse, drug use, alcohol use... All at the same time. 




 Not sure if feasible but my high school sells mattresses for their football team. Big profit compared to candy bars. 




 Just cut it out. You can do it and won't miss it.

Healthy eating works too (so I hear). 




 Already on ambien. Tryna get more blown 




 Humans are so unique! Sometimes killers become monsters in our heads . 




 Browse reddit. Search for threads about the zodiac killer. I did that the other day and was so intrigued. I just took an ambien trying to get freaky, I hope I can make it past the drowsiness and join you. I've been up since 4am. 




 Yes. It did result in a relationship which I guess I can't be mad at. He showed me different things and took me on the ride of my life thus far, even though we never really "dated."

Gut feelings hold a lot of importance. 




 I'm very sorry for the deaths in your family. It's hard but what a blessing to have had them in your life, to make it more beautiful.

It's reddit, time to spill how you messed up. I've been through a lot and I'm not one for preaching, but I do enjoy telling others my experiences and how I look at different situations. 




 No that's rude as fuck and weird. Seems like she's using you and you're better than that. Sorry. Just an outsiders view. 




 At least you can feel feelings. Even when I'm ecstatic, I'm not "high." 

Ask her out and be a 27 mature kind gentleman and get some ice cream in the park over homemade sandwiches and a picnic basket. 




 Happy birthday, very exciting but be careful. Welcome to the 21 club, friend. You made it 21 years ;) 




 Brand new-dj entendu
The dangerous summer - reach for the sun
Lydia-illuminate 




 You're in your 30s and live right in the middle of white collar and blue collar. You probably have one kid that you want to be a rock star. And a gotee 




 You smoke weed but don't do much more, yet you live a respectable life as a productive human being and are empathetic and compassionate to others.  




 Veggie burgers. 




 Do you have a dog? Take them to a class or day care and after, talk with the teacher or whatever and ask them to teach you.  




 College isn't worth it but having a degree is.

Learning is worth it. 




 Work hard and be nice to people.

My old boss (who was more like a parental figure) used to tell me "everyone has their problems." Not really advice but impactful. 




 Stolen money/gift cards. 




 Find Steve jobs and tell him to make the iphone 10. 




 If you told him a dark secret or something that is heartbreaking to you or difficult, would he try and comfort you and give a damn?  




 No just do khakis and the polo. Or dress pants with a fun print and cardigan. 




 Probably when someone dies.  




 Clients, equipment, a plan of action.

What are you going to do for the dogs and in what time period? Costs? How are you going to promote? How will you "transfer" the dogs? Things like cutting nails have serious health implications and should be learned by a professional prior. 




 Me too. so much for my one moment of wit for the day :( 




 Probably Jim Kelly or a famous sport coach. 




 That there are so many weird hobbies and obsessions I never heard of, and that there are people with the same sense of humor as me out there.. Oh and people are actually willing to share information and help if you ask. 




 Not unless it's something I may return or a big ticket item. You never know, but food and stuff like that, NOPE.  




 Bleachers-I wanna get better 




 The wonder years whole album called "the upsides." 




 Any update? I can't keep track of new posts here. 




 Want to date? 




 I probably have like $1 floating around on that site. I think there's a sub for it... /r/mturk ? 




 A few things as a manager for a quick service place (and of course past worker):

Don't let this get you down. Yes, it's mcdonalds but everyone has their struggles and although you may not feel anyone else will hire you, they will. You have something to bring to the table, whether you know it or isn't visible yet.

You supervisor shouldn't make you feel angry or upset. It's his job to LEAD you. Leadership is about bringing out the best in people and helping them towards their goals and growing.

If you're not happy, I'd say quit. I know this isn't always possible because of financial situations but sometimes you just have to go with your gut.

Also, I kind of skimmed this post, but I hope you realize there will always be hardships in life and in a career and need to be able to cope and reorganize yourself to work through these issues. 




 75% off hotels. 




 I thought that too and considered eating it again. I don't think that's why I'm depressed though, although diet is probably one of my main problems. I bet this is more of a humorous post, but if anyone has articles on depression and meat/non meat eaters, send them my way. 




 A few other bands posted a video like this, I think they covered a Brand New song, maybe TBS. Anyone remember this or can link me? 




 Not sure what that means.. 




 I don't eat meat so I'm probably not the best person to ask. What dish is served with these options? Chicken is probably the healthiest, and if I ate meat, I'd only eat chicken or turkey. Lean meat, great protein, plus all the chickens in the world are only alive due to human breeding for dietary purposes, so if you're worried about what is humane, don't worry -- we already ruined the species and I don't think they can become extinct anymore. 




 My friends 2 year old sibling. So funny. 




 No but I'll eat anything at any time. 




 Likewise. 




 To put story behind the post, I want to get away from my problems, not talk about them. 




 Or experience any real happiness. 




 It's a coverup for my inability to connect/learn/make friends with depth... I guess 




 Namaste 




 No I do not know how to relax, that's my problem. Why relax when you could be doing something productive? HOWEVER, there is nothing that matters more in the world than happiness, making memories and connections, and learning from others. IMO at least. 




 She really is a great human. Need to read Amy's autobiography next. 




 Never been near a tornado, what are you guys doing? Where do you go? 




 No but Tina Fey's bossypants made me feel feelings. 




 Stuff from home, your own business. Maybe housekeeping, paperwork, secretary 




 Message me to talk, I'm on mobile and it's difficult but can help. 




 But I can't cut it out of my diet =( 




 Statue of Liberty too. 
























 take a few hundred then turn it in. 




 Female? Khakis, black pants, or black jeans. Nice dress shirt or tank with a cardigan. Be friendly and treat it like a conversation with a friend. You'll be find. 




 Intelligence - 8.5

physical - 6

sexual abilities - 9 




 Take her to grab a coffee or ice cream before the party. Best of both worlds. 




 Yes, of course ask her! If you like her enough to post this, then do it! Don't text her. At least call her. Or text her to plan a skype date then ask her. If you want to spend a little bit, send flowers with a note. Or, just make the drive. 90 minutes isn't too far.

Just do it! 




 I can't answer this for you because it's all your feelings. forget about the girl moving or her sleeping around. Now which would you prefer? You said you're in love with number 1, remember?

Go with your gut. 




 Yes. Funny in a sarcastic, friendly or witty manner is very appealing. The kind of funny where you make fun of other people, are obnoxious, or make poop jokes is not attractive and quite annoying.

BUT, be yourself. Don't try and become a comedian, just be you. 




 Yes, they can most likely refer you to some type of counseling.

Just tell them how you feel and all your symptoms. What helps is to write a list beforehand so they know everything. That's pretty much it. I recommend a psychiatrist over your regular family doctor though. If you're still in college, they usually have free counseling and a psychiatrist on hand for your convenience.  




 A form of coping. Plus plenty of meterial. You look at the world differently because your brain lists things of importance differently. Making people laugh for me is one of the things that gives me self confidence and being sarcastic and witty is a way to stay sane for me, if that makes any sense.  




 He looks just like beckham to me.  




 No 




 A really bad paper cut wound. 




 Riding gave me sore thighs for like 3 days. Once I woke up with pretty bad scratches on my legs in all different areas, I think from a bunk bed. And of course bruised knees, which is a horrible cliche.

Man I miss rowdy sex.  




 I think this is the winner here. 




 French fries and mayo 




 All mom and pop, nonchains. I don't understand why people go unless you're out of town and unsure.  




 Interesting question. I'd have to do some calculations and see what tools were provided for me. I think $400,000 may be acceptable for the client and myself. 




 If she is actively trying to work on herself and an adult, then no, I'd let her try therapy and be just there for her. Talk to her first, say you want to say something to her parents and think she needs more help BEFORE making a big move. 




 Um, probably just a guy that can be my friend. When you're a friend, you give a fuck about them and can also shoot the shit with. 




 ask your neighbor. if he hassles, tell him you'll buy him mcdonalds.
Or craigslist.
Or call the local news for help. Or a radio station. Or yik yak.
Or be like the girl from that one college that said she would carry around a mattress until her rapist got expelled, which then led to multiple people carrying the mattress FOR her for weeks. 




 you sound like a fun friend. Your girlfriend as well. Keep it up. 




 was he gay? 




 I thought bets like this were just stupid jokes and nobody followed through, mostly because we all forget about it 5 minutes later. It sounds like you wanted it...

But seriously, I don't really find this a big deal. Is that bad? 




 I'd say keep a job and get a degree in something first (if you don't already). In the meantime, expand your horizons. Say "yes" more to people inviting you to do new things, take up a hobby, read something you find interesting. Then make a list of things you like to do. Not like "taking people's temperatures" but more of your character traits and what eases you/excites you. Discover who you are by what gives you internal pleasure or drive. 




 Maybe you should talk with someone to get past that. There's one thing to be naturally introverted, but this seems like something that's holding you back from greater things. I'm really sorry this happened to you. 




 Sex and killing people... but not in that order. 




 vegetables... what's really great is homemade veggie chips or fries. Basically just roast stuff in chip or dry form and pretend it's a junk food. carrots, zucchini, kale, turnips, etc 




 relaxing or not multitasking. I always need something to do, to work towards. huge perfectionist.

other than that, I cannot stand dishes in the sink!! 




 as fast as my heartbeat. 




 bossypants - tina fey 




 Eat fast food you have back home. Rob a bank, rape, stone a woman. Insult our military. Use racial slurs.

But other than that you can do anything. If you're asking what major sites are overrated and not worth your time, start a new thread. 




 One I love is I Wanna Get Better by Bleachers.

Gym class Heroes/Travie McCoy have a few but I can't remember the titles now.

Otherwise by Macklemore 




 Same At my schools. If your parent didn't call in the morning, you got a phone call home by an administrator, or if it was high school, you got a recorded message saying you weren't in.  




 I always just stayed home. once I went to a hockey game though. I wish I would have forged more early dismissal/late arrival notes though. I went to school far too often.

College is another story.  




 Until you get addicted.  




 I was going to post something similar but I didn't want reddit to judge me because I judge a guy by their looks. 




 Depends how it's done and by whom. If he doesn't cat call or say "yo mami", I think, "wow! I'm not that ugly! At least one part of me is nice!"

Other than that I just get uncomfortable and scared.  




 Don't be late or shy. Know when you can work.

I was like 10 minutes late and didn't plan my other jobs schedule to tell them my availability and fucked it up. 

Oh, and dress nice. 




 Shameless! Best show on tv.  




 Were you at a party or with other friends? If so, get them to hang out again and make sure she comes. From there, get her number. If it works well at the get together, ask her there if shed like to get coffee or a drink. 

Pretend Facebook never existed and it's 1985. 




 Yes of course. Did you think it's like the CEO or manager of something? If so, wear a pants suit. Other than that, wear a cardigan, nice shirt, and slacks. That works for most jobs. 




 Panty selling probably 




 Not surprised one bit. 




 Probably either be engaged or married. With a career. Would be pretty down on myself if I was without either. Definitely moved out as well.

As far as activities, I'd like to get my car inspected by myself. Travel oversees again. Volunteer in a different country. Rock climb! 




 No you can never please everyone, whether it be the countries people or other countries. However, like the other comment, Switzerland is inching there and I think Amsterdam is doing well. 




 Just like every day- wake up and say "today im going to be great!" Take a hot shower and grab a coffee and remain optimistic. Find something to look forward to! Like next weekend of an amazing dinner you're going to cook when you get out of work. It may sound cliche but you if you tell yourself you're going to have a good day, you'll start believing it. 




 i looked in here before watching but idc, she's dead?!/ yess! 




 I would have thought he meant standards. Like it's easier than you think.  




 tell me about the teachers lounge and any gossip about the teachers. 




 This is absolutely insane to me. I know people in NY that have their masters in teaching and can barely get a subbing job.  




 what site posts the quickest? I need to get to bed early tonight but want to watch ASAP. 




 Yeah I always need to be working. Just got 2 jobs for 60 hours a week. Because the job schedule, I still have afternoons free and I'm off all day Tuesday and I hate it. It's actually a problem, I always feel bored or lazy. 




 I think I had a mental breakdown in my lifetime, yes. But tonight (slightly dramatic) I have not. Hanging in there  




 I'm hoping my new jobs get me to slim down because I'm phat 




 Woohoo! I miss those early days, like my first 5 times having sex. Lots of nostalgia for that point in my life. I had sex last week and it felt like a daily routine, like brushing my teeth. *sigh*

Watching the walking dead tonight? 




 How old are you?

How many girls have you had vanginal sex with?

How do you handle sex? Like, do you just assume to not thrust so far in or what? I don't have a penis so that may be a stupid question.

Oh, and where do you live? I'm interested.... 




 Damn... 




 I love Belgium! I want to go back right now.
 




 What's the word, baby bird? 




 Literally everything. 




 I don't buy cheap canned foods there. I make sure if I buy canned food, I try and find low or no added sodium and/or sugar, possibly organic, brands which aren't normally carried by these stores.

I'll buy store brand names for pretty much anything. Mom says stick to popular brands for cleaning supplies.  




 Working in food service. Cooking, walking, serving, carrying stock. Plus you get paid! 




 Hahaha I've gotten similar. 




 Cholesterol and eggs.
Fat being "bad." 




 I personally believe in it. I know stuff is probably staged and cut to look and sound different but overall, I feel she is legit.

I might be in the minority here. 
























 I'm so excited for you! I wish someone would ask me out. If you're east coast, your have two hours. Will expect an update. 




 It's just how you view it. Embrace the whitey in yourself and all will flourish. 




 Fuck that. I praise the sun and take in all it's rays. 




 Thank you for this post because now I know what I'm going to make for dinner!!!

The answer is.......


French toast!
Wanna come over? 




 I've become a little more apathetic. I think this has to do with my ability to get 3.0 GPA (minimum) without trying AT ALL. I'm very good at playing the system, and my college is not hard in general. So, I really don't care about walking out of class or skipping or giving a fuck about what I wear, how people perceive me, how many friends I have on campus, etc. If i feel it's not worth my time, i won't show up. If I think a professor is ridiculous I won't show up or I'll let my voice be heard. I guess this is part of adulthood and synonymous with independence.

Also, I learned it's okay to think outside the box and your opinions actually ARE what professors want to hear. I've been lucky to take a handful of classes with professors that let you (and expect you) to be free with your thought. Some of the things I wrote seem like I'm high out of my mind, but it's really just me digging deeper and making connections that I've been forced to not look into in other classes. 




 I'll spin it tomorrow 




 I've been Into exploration as well and started metal detecting. Great way to see the outdoors and float around to new places/hidden gems in your area. 




 It's PEMDAS. Parentheses, exponent, multiplication or division (left to right), addition or subtraction (left to right). 




 The answer is 6. Parentheses first, then division and multiplication left to right.
2*3=6 




 Have you talked to your doctor about antidepressants? They often help with anxiety all together, rather than a quick fix like xanax. Same with your focus, really will help on a low dose.

I've been on my share of antidepressants that have changed my levels of anxiety. I've found when I'm on a pill that completely removes anxiety, I am unproductive and boring. Anxiety kind of forces me to multitask and complete things fully and quickly. I manage every little detail which is why I do so well, esp at jobs.
 




 Yeah I just got off from work and headed to some more spots today. Got too messy in my work clothes and shoes so headed home. Going big tomorrow on my day off though!! 




 I am definitely getting better each time I dig a plug! Luckily where I've been has either been my own property or land that's otherwise not well kept so I can hide my mistakes for now! 




 $loan $150.00 




 Thanks for the welcoming. Went out today for 2.5 hours, multiple place. just kept finding beer can and rocks! and 11c! I will not be discouraged, heading to the beach tomorrow! 




 Having trouble, can send you something via paypal if you have one. 




 dark net 




 garbage men 




 Yup. End of thread. 




 Been there. Look at /r/opiatesrecovery 
If you can't do it alone colt turkey, try lupe or kratom. If that doesn't work, get suboxone from a sub clinic.. Of course rehab is a possibility.

Get yourself to a counselor as well because issues aren't just on the surface.

You'll be good, stay positive. 




 It 100% pays off being nice! I will go out of my way for any nice guest and do it with a great attitude. For a complaining guest, I'll try my best to make you happy because its my job! And, I love the feeling of turning a rude customer to a nice grateful customer. I usually will not be overly nice though. And next time I won't be as happy as I could be.

physical contact is necessary. Plus, helen keller could get by, so can  i! 




 I've had mine dismantled and can reassure you.... it is. 




 I will dismantle your heart. 




 ARE YOU VOLUNTEERING YOURSELF AS TRIBUNE? 




 That's awesome. Artificial sweeteners have a similar effect on the GI system.

I want to try a chip. 




 Omg your answers are in sync with my brain. This is a hard breakup but I support your decision. 




 This is down the road from me. Always makes me smile when social media posts it around. 




 Chelsea smile.. 




 Oh and do you want to be my boyfriend?  




 Did you tell her what you told us? 




 What is your name? I feel like I dated you... (See below) 




 I want to live as minimally as possible but feel like this is a big step moving out. Thanks for the encouragement though. 




 taco bell veggie cantina bowl. my stomach right now... send help... 




 Worked for me once. I didn't really care either way though and my boss was a great pal. 




 it's like soured milk chunks 




 Canada's fries-- fries, gravy, cheese curds. 




 definitely recommend yak and yeti! WOuldn't go to Be out Guest. Just mediocre. 




 Ya I graduate in less than a month. Freaking out but trying to remain optimistic and stand my ground. Focus on right now, rather than finding a career for the rest of my life.

As far as motivation, maybe you'd like to talk to a doctor about getting on a mild antidepressant. I don't think you're necessarily depressed but rather in a rut going through an existential crisis. 




 Because I'd want to save it to make pinky promises.

And if want my left ring finger for marriage. 




 Probably a pinky on one finger and the ring finger on the other.

So 200k. 




 I think you new to do some soul searching. Explore, spend time alone, spend time with strangers, travel, take up new hobbies or volunteer. After this, Make a list of your positive traits and what you find you like or value. 

If you don't have a job, get one even if it's not a "career" and work hard at it to make you feel confident. Plus it takes time away from dwelling on your problems and puts your energy into something else other than anxiety.

Think about your "virgin" situation. Do you want to have sex for yourself or because you think it's what you NEED to do (just like you NEED to get a job out of college)? If it's the former, go right ahead and pursue that but know it's not going to solve any problems.

Other than that, someone once told me to not worry about what you're going to do to create happiness for the rest of your life but rather focus on what makes you happy in your current life. (I probably and wording this wrong) 

Good luck I've been there and overcome some of the problems that you've mentioned but still right there with you on others. 
 




 Whole situation is stupid. Don't pay her and ignore this train wreck of a person. 




 The song I don't mind. The intro video is what kills me. It's so long and pretty old now. They should just have a scene at the bar as an intro or something. 




 exercise. That's all I got. 




 amazing. As I graduate with a B.S. in Business Admin, I'm realizing I am more intrigued with a career along the lines of social work. Any advice? Are there any entry level positions you think I'd be qualified for without any social work background right now? Or, any similar career paths you think would suit someone interested in helping people, dealing with children and human science? 




 Yes, that's why we keep having sex. 

Gotta cut him out soon. 




 I'm a girl and would probably do it but not get into a relationship. It's his choice and I'm not the only one to blame. 




 No this sounds weird as hell. Not normal, tell her to stop. 




 Probably cost efficiency.

I actually live near next to 6 and think 7 is also a great place to live if you like heat.

You can get a job where I live as a waiter anywhere. 1600E is $2000+ America? That'd get you a pretty good apartment here with at least $500 spending money. But this obv changes by location in the US. I'd say the average where I like is $1000USD, so maybe 800E.

Up north, you don't really feel the racism. Down South, it's a little different. I wouldn't really say it's that racist or segregated, but people do have different views than what us in the North view difference races. What you hear about shootings happen, but no, it's not like that. There's rape and mugging but it's not something we should be known for. Inner cities you'll find more or it.

Don't live in Compton or NYC.

 




 No. My mom used to be just like yours and when I was too young to go to the bathroom myself, I remember her putting enough TP to clog the toilet on the rim of the seat. Now I just squat depending on the cleanliness. Most of the time if it looks clean and well maintained, I just sit right down. I don't care.

Once a year I put a cover on just to reminisce about my childhood and because they look fun. 




 Thanks for posting, you're giving me a lot of courage. Italy seems much more doable than the other places I listed. Sounds like a challenge planning and going alone but I'm certainly going to look into it. 




 $loan $30 




 He's probably the happiest guy I ever met, never once yelled and just so helpful and friendly overall. I for want to let him down or disobey him because he deserves respect and doesn't need my hassles or bullshit.  




 I just grab coffee in my car. 




 Spray poopouri or another perfume/febreeze in the toilet before you go and flush. 




 Sounds like you have an anxiety disorder. Maybe talking it out with someone, even a friend, will help. 




 Probably testosterone and ability to build muscle easier. 




 Why don't you ask the people you're living with how they feel? Id rather have the 3bdrm but I'm not living there. 




 Kinda just want to get high and converse. 




 It's much, much more acceptable than calling guys "boys." Just a synonym for me. I don't have a problem with it. 




 Wow this is extremely interesting. If I go to my psychiatrist and ask for your script, what do you think would happen? Would I need to do a tap? We've tried 3 antidepressants and I'm not doing great, I wonder if he'd give it a try. 




 Girl. I can be a grill if you're into that shit, oh yeah bb 




 You probably don't want to hear this but I 100% think it should be required to go to a community college for 1 or 2 years and take some gen eds right out of high school, then transfer. It saves money and gets you focused, both with the college atmosphere and your future wants and needs. If you wanna be away, you can always get an apartment, rent out a room near a college and be on your own. 




 Lmao thanks that's the one 
























 Offer to do something she wants. or a fetish.
only fair. 




 I'd rather share my opinion about the multitude of threads talking about the banning of FPH.
 




 Yes, 100%. My depression was based on not knowing how to communicate, cope, express myself, because of my upbringing. And other things of course (genetics, imbalance). But yes, that's why I started to use. Some others here may say they didn't start because of this, but continued to use because of depression. Slippery slope. Fuck depression.

Edit: opiates have been 10x better for my depression than SSRIs/SNRIs. 




 This happens all the time. They just changed the packaging. One is newer than the other. 




 12 steps 




 Left my penis in the car, one of them melted slightly.

 To rebuild again and learn from this. To realize the compassion and similarities in others. To try and find the "highs" in life. To meet me.  




 I had one, and we fell in love. Now we don't talk and really would like someone that is in the same boat as me. They should have a depression dating site. 




 Yes, there is more risk vaginally, but I would of course make them wear condoms, which obv is still risky (this whole situation isn't ever going to happen), but does cut down. I honestly feel BJs are more personal and I would be able to have sex with a gross guy but I probably would not be able to give a gross guy a BJ. 




 Doesn't matter either way, imo. I think you're safe with just the shirt. 




 I'm F and yeah, it's a turn on because it means he's going to eat me out which is literally the best thing in the entire WORLDDDD. 




 I don't even understand what your job or company is... 




 come on down im broke 




 $300 vag  sex, $600 BJ. 




 Well black is sleek but who cares? I like the white too.  




 Good for you, not just for realizing you have a problem, but for getting your wife involved and putting things on the table.  




 Well, it affects every single aspect of my life. It'd take me a day to write it out and there are multiple people that have already written articles/blogs on their own experiences. 

What are the biggest things for me (at the moment) have been school. I can't concentrate, I don't care about getting good grades, I don't go to class b/c I can't get out of bed, I feel sick when I get a bad grade or don't know something, I feel alone in the classroom, or i won't be able to complete a class so then i start thinking about my future and how i won't graduate because i can't complete the coursework, so i won't get a job, won't get a house, be broke, no one will want to marry me, can't provide for family, friends hate me, etc, the list goes and on and on it goes.

Then there's work. I can't get out of bed or bathe, so fuck it, I'll call in. Then I'll realize I should just quit because my brain says I'm useless. Hard to remain interested in a job or give a fuck or no get angry at the littlest things. then you start worrying about money without a job and then the wild thoughts run through your head like stated above.

And then socially - I feel like laying in bed all day, in pjs, unshowered. I don't want to talk to anyone. I see people doing things, having fun, excelling at work, and it makes me feel bad about myself. I think I'm useless or boring or a pain for others, a burden, etc.

This was based on depression, but there's also problems with anxiety and mania that are pretty much the same things. 




 shia labeouf, jennifer aniston, Fat Amy, Leonardo Decaprio, Florence and the Machine... 




 wow. Just wow.


wow. 




 Draw Lucille Ball on top of a pogo stick, hopping on the stomach of a 400 lb man with an afro that is simultaneously playing the violin. 




 Um, probably people believing in me, telling me i'm talented, "the best", interesting, funny, etc. Encouraging me to make something of my life, I like those people and their energy.  




 Please don't tell me I'm not depressed because I'm not acting the same way you were when depressed. Ye, I'm clinically depressed and have been since my diagnosis 1.5 years ago. I'm both bored and disinterested in my job, because I'm bored and disinterested with every component in my life. I feel no joy or interest in anything and this is certainly not y first time taking a mental health day. 




 this is really hot, actually. 




 Oxford, England. 




 THERE WILL NEVER BE ONE.

Seriously, I was you 6 months ago. Taking opiates because it was the only thing that worked. Some people get depressed and suicidal because of the pills, I was depressed and took the pills to stop the depression. It got out of control and I had to stop. Now I'm on antidepressants that barely help. They suck. Opiates are much better but I'm constantly debating if it's worth the risk. 

Kratom is legal and similar to opiates for me, in terms of motivation and interest. 




 Tell him and make your life YOUR life.  




 WOW! I've been researching ECT because meds just don't seem to be helping. What's your timeline look like as far as first med tried and last? I've gone through prozac, cymbalta, lexapro, and then wellbutrin and another one I can't remember. Getting discouraged, I hate going to my doctor and having to tell him "Nope, still want to die." I hope he doesn't give up on me or get frustrated. 




 Oh my god, so many feels. 




 I've been meaning to check that out, thanks for the reminder. 




 Education systems. 




 Depends. I mean, I don't eat meat so if someone asks for a recommendation like that, I usually state what others have told me and the reputation. I used to work at a juice bar, and when it wasn't ferociously busy, 90% of the time I had an in depth conversation, explaining everything, giving them recommendations. That was my favorite part of my job!

At the end of the day, though, we all have different tastes. I could like one restaurants type of sauce, and you may hate it, but we both like spaghetti sauce. So, it's hard. But to answer your question directly, no, it's not annoying to me AT ALL. I love it. I think a lot of bartenders are like this too!

I'm sure some people hate it, however, and these people are probably those that hate their job, menu, or products.

 baggy jeans. You don't have to wear skinny, tight jeans, but wear something that fits your body. Also, sneakers are something that bother me. Obviously, you can wear sneakers, but theres a certain type that screams "grandpa" or "dad" that creeps me out. 




 Construction or enter a trade. Work somewhere with room to grow, ex hotel. Take a career aptitude test.

Why don't you like your jobs? Rather than saying they suck, think of the specifics, and then generalize them. For example, I found I can't handle a job/company that doesn't allow creative freedom. 




 Thanks. A lot of information here. I should post in this sub more often because you're all terribly helpful.

I'll start by looking at my manuel. There's nothing specific I want to know, I just feel stupid when a guy pops the good to take a look, and I would have no idea where to start. 




 Original borrow of $150, pay $55 for 3 installments. Great borrower, very honest and trustworthy. Fully paid on time! 




 I'm a female but don't know anything. I could probably change a tire but I want to know what connects to what, what parts look like, etc. I feel there should be a minimum that we put men able to fix, but I think that should go for everyone. 




 Too much attention, feels like I'm showing off and the center of the universe which I don't like. Preconceived expectations about how you're SUPPOSED to celebrate, but never do anything exciting. And dislike of another year passing (usually in relation to feelings about not being successful/in a good place vs. what you think you should be at that age).

 Go on a site that switches letters around in a word or phrase to make a new word or phrase with the same letter. I can't remember what they're called right now... 




 Awesome! That's is exactly what I'm looking for! 




 Clitoris and your tounge. Kissing.  




 All parties need to get off before you leave 




 Honestly, if you like her is suggest waiting until dating. Things might get funny with sex, it happened to me.

Trim up decently. Make sure you're clean. Then start kissing her. Eventually feel and caress her then fuck her. Also, if you get off quick and then button up, you will be a dick if she got no enjoyment out of it. If you care about her, you'd get her off too.

I despise guys that leave after they cum after 2 minutes. Nothing more disrespectful. 




 Call people up for sex 




 This is why I've never visited old teachers.. 




 Nerve, Heavy Gloom, and How you are.

They all blend in and as of right now, they all sound SO similar. However, it's a really great album to listen to while doing something. Really pumped up and enjoyable. 




 Thank you!! I applied for the open nccc's open! 




 I want to do something similar, have a business degree though. What's your official job title and can others get in like you? 




 Stories of reddit stepping in and saving lives. There's been a few, one I remember about a runaway abused wife.

In a most shocking post, someone posted a video of a guy being decapitated and sliced all over, all his limbs off and then just beating the shit out of him. Really gruesome. 




 Are the nccc'a the 10 month, full paid rooming thing I was looking at? 




 Close you eyes and pucker up for a kiss. Now you know that answer. 




 Love and be loved. Be free and help others gain strength. 




 vagina, butt, mouth. we got this under control. 




 I haven't worked in a market but have worked at a place that does samples. The worst is people that just want something free and pick it up and keep walking. Or anyone that seems as if they're definitely not going to buy anything. If you take a sample, expect to stay for 30 seconds and let me tell you about the product. If you want to try all of them because you want to try something new and potentially buy, I have no problems with you. 




 We're on the right track! I'll do something like this. 




 Ill probably just text him to fuck the shit out of me.

And yeah, I guess people do t user stand my question ?

 Mierda is shit? Wasn't that girl from tangled named mierda? 
























 Crafts like bracelets. 




 What kind of camp are you going to? I'm old and don't know of any camps but I still want to go! 




 I've done that multiple times for school and work. If you get enough caffeine you'll get the over tired energy and be wide awake until you suddenly CRASH which is hopefully after the shift. Which hotel do you work at? (If it's a chain) 




 If you had the dope now you have wouldn't have to worry about shitting. 




 I'm fucked up so now I'm apathetic and act like an asshole. 




 For $600 in Cali, you'll live in a shitty area/apartment. Find a roommate, either someone near a college, via craigslist, through subreddits. You're better off renting a room for $400ish with a few roommates.

 Idk where you live. Get a sub and fries. Or Chinese

 Yup. Sounds like it. She's probably just used to fucking and not having much relationship type sex. She'll probably love it though. You'll have to teach her! 




 I have a few ideas that kind of make sense. One that is more nonprofit, the other is more art therapy. Ughhhhhh. anxiety. 




 I'm a bad planner and lack motivation and support. I have too many ideas and don't know how to center them. I think a large part of it is my depression. At this point, I'm just happy to be able to get out of bed and go to work in the morning. I don't even know where to begin and everything I read on /r/smallbusiness and /r/entrepreneur is overwhelming. Oh, and I don't know how to promote it. 




 either some kind of arts/craft/decor business or a nonprofit or organization for kids down the wrong path. Mixing both together would be ideal. 




 up! 




 I have the same degree, graduated in May. I've gotten offered sales and marketing jobs but fuck the man. I have business and refuse to contribute to the overwhelming consumerism. I don't care at this point. I'm secure at home for now and will wait until I find a good job. I don't overly care/worry about work, I care about life.

Oh, and I remember reading an article that was on the top 10 companies that hire new college grads. Google that! You're going to have to pay your dues if you want to work in HR, I think. 




 Only read the tl;dr. I think you're 100% normal and have the vegabond bug! You have to take action. Do what you love, continue exploring. This is who you are! Not stuck in an office, not stuck with these people that are doing nothing and are so closed off from the rest of the world, content with staying still. Own it, do it. You are who you are. This could be a career, this could be your life.

 Do it you pussy! (your words not mine)

Ever seen that one Shia Lebeuf film (can't remember the name). He draws a small picture of the girl, then when she walks by, he says "hey did you drop this?" and it has his number on it as well. I think it's cute. I'm a female. 




 I've only seen 37 of these. Don't tell anyone. 




 I need to see this ASAP! 




 Get in touch with the 2 murderers that escaped from prison in NY. they know how to do it. 




 Heroin actually is sometimes cut with ground cocoa puffs and similar cereals. 




 Rice, potatoes, Mac and cheese. Sneak into breakfast at a hotel, take anything portable home, like milk, bread, yogurt, fruit. I probably wouldn't eat the cocoa puffs. Fill a water bottle up in public places like a mall or library. 




 Pen, hair ties, pepper spray.  




 You need to detach yourself from these people, even if they are your blood. 




 I haven't heard anything but I applied early May. I would like to know because I don't want to start a new job and leave in February. For those that did receive anything, did you get an email or did you just keep checking the site? 




 I'll be honest here, stop crying about not having a cell phone. That's not your biggest problem and you need to step back and look at what you're saying. Get a track phone if you're so worried about it. Go to a library and apply for jobs. Ask for them to contact you via email. Go in person and hope for open interviews or an on the spot hire. You got this. If you can't afford a track phone (I think they're like $10/month), ask /r/assistance for help. Good luck, chief. 




 Its June 18 now bro 




 Maybe a kiosk 




 Okay, but sounds like you lived life and made some memories. Who knows if you would have had that opportunity when you were retired or something. 




 What did you spend it on?
 




 The time I fell in love. 




 I wouldn't do much of anything other than introduce myself. That and shovel their sidewalk, mow their sidewalk, take in garbage cans if they're not home.  




 Yes. It's a really dirty high though. Also makes opiates more potent and cures the itchiness associated with it. Or maybe you gave her an STD and her vagina is really itchy. 




 Head over to /r/opiates or /r/opiaterecovery. They can definitely help. I urge you to try kratom or subs. But right now you wanna get antidiarrhea meds. Take a lot and sickness will be bearable. Are you on any anxiety meds? Those help. 




 Mint chocolate and anything fruity and chocolate.  




 hit up a free hotel breakfast. 




 you know the rule, if you post pill porn, you gotta share! 




 Well you need to make some chances, but don't go crazy right away. I think you need to sleep on it. You may want to make a rash decision now and quit but tomorrow you'll realize it'll cause you more problems. You boyfriend is not your world. You are your own person and responsible for your happiness. Start looking at new jobs but most importantly, get active. Do what you love to do and dedicated more time to these things. Experience life and look at work as a small part of life.
 




 Either quit and work with your dad FT.
OR
quit and work at the new company.

Sounds like you shouldn't stay where you are. 




 I'd stay stick it out for a few more months, then look for something else and quit once you have a secure position. You say it doesn't challenge you-- how can you go above and beyond? Work outside your job description. Even if you don't want to be promoted to manager, you may keep your sanity. 




 Astray by let it happen.
Disintegration by turnover. 




 dump your girl and ask new girl out. 




 Well, I think your case is a little extreme. What kind of underwear do you use? Get some cotton or something extremely absorbent. I get ass sweat, but only when doing cardio. I think you have a problem. Certain dry is good for armpits, may want to talk to someone about something similar for all parts of the body.  Botox is known to be used but not sure you want to go down that route. 




 Work boots. 




 What do you do for money? Do you need money? What is the average income? Are prices higher due to seclusion? Do you like it? Is it beautiful? How can I become a resident? 




 you could get aluminum window covers 




 Damn that sucks, but I know what you mean! That's how my work is now. I slave away and do amazing, yet they don't really care.

Electrical would be good. Plumbers, linemen. You start at the bottom but they pay for school and can end up making a real decent salary. 




 he's on some criminal minds shit. He wants to learn women's fears, then make their nightmare a reality to haunt them until their death. 




 Crackers. There are so many different kinds these days.

 Oh, and try those dutch donut things from a stand outside. 
























 Yes because I was horny and stressed and bored. I'm in a private cube anyway.  




 You're right. I'm a female and wouldn't go home with him. 




 I'm Italian so im hairy. I pluck my toe hair 




 Thanks. Where is he?? 




 Because they're formal but here to get their hands dirty. 




 Requiem for a dream. Can I just get high instead? 




 Try gofundme then post to /r/borrow /r/assistance and your Facebook 




 I'm not sacrificing anything for a job. I can't let it get in the way of life. 




 Stuck their dick in someone's eye 




 Yes. Just as annoying as your face. 




 Utopia 




 New England is expensive! 




 Yeah you should get on that. You should poop every day. Get yourself 2 bottles of magnesium oxide and clean yourself out! 




 You sound very passionate and angry about sneakers. You should try flip flops. 




 Never thought about it but I agree. Isn't their skiing though? 




 Read this whole thing as if you were talking about brownies. imagine my confusion. Never heard of this show though. 




 I'm no bro. But I am a 4. 




 Well well well this sounds fun. 




 Nostalgia 




 That looks like something that crumbles off my wall. 




 No because there are no leagues below me. 




 My desk 




 You're going to want to get her to a therapist. You have to do so in a way that's supportive and shows how important it is to better deal with this, to make things like watching a movie easier. It's not because she's crazy, but anyone that has went through this should have counseling. I suggest you go as well. I feel like her mom needs to know. But you can't be the one to say anything. If she was a good mom, she wouldn't let her daughter feel uncomfortable with the man together. 




 Don't go to a dealership. 




 I think you're a cop. 




 Yes. Why do you ask? 




 I think you should take the new job. I don't support jobs that make you miserable, but the only problem it seems are the hours. I think you can arrange a way to plan your activities. Plus, laying off workers isn't a good sign, even if they don't do it twice. Just my personal opinion based on what I would do. 




 Tattoo someone. Graffiti something on public display. Have children. Visit Sicily, India, south Africa. Take my baby cousin and aunt to Europe on my dinner. 




 Yes. Better than me. I was top of my class, honors classes, took review courses, blah blah blah. Did horrible on the SAT. I think for SUNY schools, 1200 and 1600 get you scholarships. Take a few practice exams and retake your junior year. You'll be good to go! 




 Nope but it's slightly better. Sorry you're going through this. I don't wish how I felt on even my worst enemy. 




 This past year. Depression, anxiety, no self control, friends, interest, job. Fucking up and ruining good things.  




 Get another job or hobby. Say yes to anything if someone asks you to do something. Hit this girl up again. Hook up with her, you'll feel better. 




 Yes and no. I used to be really shy and when they stopped talking, I felt like a loser. Like I couldn't keep their attention or they didn't like me because I was boring. I mean, they have every right to stop talking but it made me sad when we'd just sit in silence. If you grasp at straws long enough, I'll open up. 




 Ask about something they love. They'll talk more because they probably like sharing. At work, I picked the role as the weirdo so I could make people laugh and ask them questions like playing the favorites game. Seeing me get silly loosened them up. 




 Depression. 




 They spotted you. You're doomed. 




 When faced with an obstacle, you probably think to yourself, something has to get better and I'm not the one that can do it, yet. It's when you lose hope in yourself and need something from the universe. If I say something to god, I am thinking of energy. Something needs to align. God should be a broad term, not one guy in heaven casting spells.  




 Something about the climate I'd suppose. 




 No. Hollywood studios and an all star resort. When I was there a Chinese cast member from haunted mansion got hit by a car outside our apartment. 




 Huh? 




 Well for a guy, its tighter and the "taboo" feeling probably gets you intrigued. 

As a female, I kind of liked it. You know when you release a giant turd and for a second it feels amazing? That's how it kinda feels but for an extended time. I think I said this during anal sex and it was probably a mistake. 




 The blue or black dress. 




 Apples to apples and cards against humanity are definitely fun even when sober lol 




 Can you link me? Or I can send paypal 




 Idk talking about sexx 




 No. Because. Is taco a sandwich? 




 Disney world lol. 




 I feel the same. So I don't put up a picture. Id say post something where you're dressed decently, at some kind of party, and crop out anything bad. Or get a plain room with a dress shirt and take a photo with a timer. 




 I say soda because I worked at a place with a lot of international travel. I think it sounds better.  




 what state are you in? Marriott by chance? 




 Maybe want to visit /r/asexual 




 Cut the grass. Everyone here says pop. Upstate NY. 




 Looks amazing! Don't change a thing (for now). 




 I see what you mean, I'm just more interested in obstacle courses and adventure. Maybe I should just start hiking and making my own workouts at the park. 




 I don't really like working out. I prefer strength training to cardio. What I don't like is making everything seem like exercise. I was to do natural things to make myself stronger, toned, and thinner. Like moving boxes, tires, carrying things. I like when I had jobs that made me physical because it felt natural. What should I be looking for? Is it called something? Any ideas would be great. 




 Naturally or artificially? Carbs and grains are amazing. Quinoa, kamut, barley, oats. I like sugar free jello too.  




 Yeah but the fact that this guy came out of nowhere was nuts. Just like something off of long island medium. I couldn't believe it. 




 I'm writing this from my new phone that seems to be malfunctioning so forgive me if it's hard to read.

He said I would move to somewhere with palm trees soon. (I was moving to Florida the following week). Said I would get into trouble with someone named ****. And that this guy was talking to other people and that would get me in trouble. (Not sure on this one. I had met a drug dealer with the same name, a month later I was supposed to pick up and the day of our plans he got arrested, lost big money. Then later found another guy with same name --all within the same week-- as soon as he told me his name I called it quits because of what the psychic said. Could have put me in jail for a felony). Hmm what else, he said I'd have to make a big move in march and id be deciding between 3 places. It'd be a big decision but the decision I would make would be the best one (I did end up moving mid march because something bad happened. Was deciding between living in Florida, home, or with a relative.) Also, said I'm one to "cover my mouth" and not speak up. But I will and it will get me to a better place. Well, what happened during those rough months was due to me speaking up to my boss, which may have been bad to say but it turned out for the best.

Basically said I'd be okay and that I was kinda fucked up be okay. 




 A guy that looked homeless (lack of a better word) came up to me while I was with my friend at a coffee shop. We were there gossiping about who knows what, never saw him come in or sit down. Then told me he was a reader. Then proceeded to read me, tell me my future. Everything has come true, including dates and names. He was very modest, left abruptly, didn't even let me say thank you (I was like WTF, what do I even say to this guy? Made sure to keep a straight face and not really respond to what he said to lead him on). He left. Just disappeared. I have no idea if he had a car or just walked in to talk to me. Very strange but cool. I've been a mess this past year so I'm sure I have a lot of energy and emit some interesting waves.  




 People with art majors are the easiest to pick out. It's a different breed. I loved my time as an art major. People are amazing but I can't describe them in one particular way. Not hippies, just floaty. 




 Better yet, eat shit so you clean and fuel yourself at once. 




 Stolen money/gift cards. 




 I work at an extended stay as well. It's fun to make friends with guests compared to a regular hotel. 




 ChapStick. Pliers. An exfoliant. Coconut oil. A foot scrubber for dead skin. I'm a bit so girly girl but these are stereotypical female items that I actually use/need. 




 Car charger too 
























 well, most people. 




 saw that coming from a mile away.  




 Why would you kill someone that 1) is willing to give you oral sex, and 2) is so concerned with your well being that will take you to the hospital when you smell bad? 




 I love working with my hands, putting things together, doing arts/crafts, etc. I need something new, something I can pick up fairly quickly with a little bit of research, and that will MAKE ME MONEY. Some crafts can be sold online but ETSY is oversaturated. I was thinking of making computers but I think that is something I wouldn't get the hang of, plus it cost a lot of money. I'm broke, my job isn't paying, and I do nothing all day, everyday. 

If you know a better sub that could help, please direct me! thanks!! 




 Kava, magnesium supplements, GABA. try these.

buspar is pretty good though, try it.  




 I just wrote this long response but it got deleted. Basically, yes it does take a while to build up but for me, its different than cymbalta or something. I can tell which days I do or don't take it, and recognize its effects. Other than Xanax, there is a very popular pill (I think a benzo) that is nonaddictive and often prescribed because of this. I can t remember its name off the top of my head but you can search for it and do your own research. Allergy pills can affect your brain like Xanax, so it could be used as a quick fix.  




 Good to hear. I'm thinking of coming off mine for the same reasons as above! 




 That sounds like something to bring to a higher up. Good for you for leaving, I would have told them to go fuck themselves. 




 Arms because I'd take that idiosyncrasy and rock it. 




 What's the job? 




 Yeah I love that they care and ask me if i need I talk but the only people that understand are people that have gone through it or are currently struggling. Everyone knows my dirty laundry, but not it's extent.

Giving you advice would be hypocritical fit me because I'm stuck in this cycle as well. I don't care about anything including myself and gave up on getting better. You need someone, done meds, and to push yourself to make memories and do things. 

Also, having a drink is fine, everyone gets through the day in their own way, but it's a depressant. Alcohol makes me want to kill myself and everyone I know that has depression (not many open people) feels worse when drinking. Just food for thought. Msg me if you'd like to talk. 




 Kratom. It's legal. 




 Witness protection? 




 To find our purpose in life. 




 Thanks :) it's the truth too. 




 Yeah I learned this about myself, i need/love physical work but who's going to hire me? I don't look strong or helpful. Idk where to look. 




 Sometimes the universe shits on you all at once. Repair yourself one by one. Check /r/assistance  




 Side note: The word "ugh" singlehandedly describes depression. 




 WTF are we going to do? Ugh 




 A critique. 




 Have you thought of digital design or communication design? My high school counselor suggested I make my own major and mix music and art. I forgot what it's called 




 Is this Canada? Just guessing because there aren't pennies anymore? 




 Used to call my own cell phone and let it vibrate. Repeatedly. 




 Did 3/4 




 And all sell dope 




 Can you send it to me 3 




 Well Friday in my case. It's still awesome. Who doesn't love money being put in your bank account?!?! 




 Message me when you find an answer because I'm right there with you. 




 Any antidepressant will have people that say good or bad things about it. It depends on the person and what they respond to, and other factors in their life. I'm on it now and gets me out of bed, no anxiety, but makes me feel nothing. But, in a way I'm back to my old self, as far as personality. It's the best out of the 3 I have tried, but do not feel happy at all. I was prescribed welbutrin in addition for energy and getting my emotions back but I feel it makes things worse and stopped. 




 Can I have a picture of said butt? 




 You're not going to know unless you ask. 




 Baby momma. It's not really known as one of the best comedies and gets pushed over but I love it. Amy and tina together are the best! 




 Cookies because every cookie is awesome.

Otc meds. If you read the label, it's usually the same chemical and dose, just store brand vs name brand. 




 There is an online community that hosts online overeaters anonymous meetings, like 3x per day. I think they have other ED online meetings for various types. I wish I wasn't on my phone and could find it.. But it's out there! Please seek help! 




 "Dad." 




 Mingle with your coworkers. Even if you don't love them, it's still is something to do, they can introduce you to people, force you to get out, and improves morale. Be friendly with your neighbors in your apt and see if they're your age. Go to a bar, even if you don't drink, and talk with the bartenders. It will help with the loneliness. Join a gym and see if they have classes and you may meet someone. If you tell them your new they may assist you and will give you something to do. All these things will ease loneliness and make you feel at home. Maybe volunteer a day or two a week somewhere like a music venue or something you're into. 




 I know someone that does. She said she doesn't love it but has been there forever and gets paid a hefty amount. Monday through Friday she is traveling, weekends she goes home. Obviously this isn't every job in the industry but something to think about. 




 Damn. All I knew was about drugs. This sickens my mood. 




 Nice. I'm going to be moving from the east to west coast next year. Idk. I believe you should take chances and do whatever makes you happy. I think a lot of people say that but don't act on it... 




 Yeah. Scariest thing is when a dealer sees you and tells you to stop buying. Stop while you're ahead. Seriously. Make a change. 




 Yes!! I saw part of it and it was so relatable but uplifting at the same time. I didn't finish it all but it's another way to look at things when life goes in different directions. 




 I barely felt anything. It was my first time and wanted to be safe. I felt the weed/alcohol high people say it feels like but wasn't too strong. But yeah, I checked the dosing and for my weight that's right in the phase 1 dose. 




 Oooh. Sorry. Misread. You can try welbutrin alone but I take it with an ssri, I don't like it but MOST people swear on this drug and call it legal crack. Give it a try 




 Never did it 




 Did it. 




 Did it 




 Ask about welbutrin. Eliminates side effects from SSRIs. Or try a lower dose. Or just get off them all together and control your anxiety naturally. You may not need. 




 Because in these movies the actresses are skinny little things and can't produce breasts, but it's also modest because they look like a guys chest.  




 I've always used WhatsApp and Facebook messenger to communicate. And then just googled "bar near me" or something and it will give you a name and directions for getting around. Are you using public transport? They may have an app for their system or site you may want to save to look at after.  




 Used to be a coffee addicted. Now I drink it once or twice a month. Doesn't pep me up, but does taste like shit now. Tastes like rotten seeds and dirt were brewed. Which is somewhat accurate. Can barely get it down, where u thought it was the best flavor EVER a year ago 




 Message me your pay stub/proof of employment and license and I'll help ya 




 Um yes. You do. I live right by the peace bridge. You say these things. 




 Not me 




 My grandpa 




 I think they were roxis. I called to get like 5 pills. He was in a rough spot and kinda fucked up that day and I ended up paying 2x what I wanted to spend, but getting 25 pills. He as like "do you just want my last ones?" Okayyyy 




 Right now he doesn't come again. 




 You should look into a parks job in your town. Or YMCA. You may be young but next year you could do something.  




 I don't train myself. I am who I am and let myself be attracted to whoever! No restraints, just intelligence. 




 Same with my niece. We limited the juice and changed to water or milk so she would start eating more because it filled her up. Didn't work too well. I'm worried, she hasn't grown and doesn't eat. :(  I can understand people that like feet and think they're attractive or like them being rubbed but some shit is cray. 




 How'd you get the job? I think bartending would be awesome and I'd be great at it but I don't drink so don't know combos and not the best conversationalist/looker. I love concoctions though and remember stuff quick! 




 Ooh some have raise hundreds of thousands of dollars. Some raise 0. Try it though, its easy to set up. I could even do it for you and the money would be sent to your account.  




 I hope he comes soon 




 Darien lake campgrounds. 




 Savings. Good job. I would never buy a 300k house at my age. I could buy a house but that sounds ridiculous. Around here, the nicest houses are 250k, anything above we consider luxurious and unnecessary. At this point, I dont plan on buying a house unless I plan to live there for 10+years starting a family and career. Sounds stupid to me but I'm a minimalist. Id be more than happy with a 1000ft house for 120k IF I knew I'd live their for a while. 




 Hey there's more than just being a vet! What do you like to do? Like, let's get to the bottom here, do you like planning? Meeting people from over the world? Entertaining? Conservation? Nature? 
























 Or, go to the professor and talk and tell them what had been going on and how to pass. Professors will help you and even pass you if you're willing to improve and go to their office hours. 




 Try and get a leave of absence due to your depression. I did this and it was very easy. My psychiatrist just wrote my diagnosis and that I should take a leave. Good luck 




 Criminal minds! It's great because its always on TV ha 




 Hmm. That sounds really interesting to me. I've been on an epistemology/spirituality/quantum physics train of thought lately. Every time I try and watch it though, I turn it off because it bores me. 




 It was a great movie and book. I have cried while reading all his books. Paper towns and looking for Alaska are next on the big screen and will have the same effect. 




 Neither are necessary. 




 Yeah but it sounds like you know what to do and have a plan. And you're motivated. This is just a hiccup in life. Dogs can be great for healing and company so think about that... Produce dopamine. 




 Uh not really 




 Twilight or kings crossing by Elliott Smith.  




 Thanks! Steppenwolf looks awesome 




 Ooh yeah. Well you need to get her to understand the changes in mood and potential of harm she can do. But, shed not going to listen to you if she's impulsive and unhealthy, that's on her and you can't really change that because she'll resent you and then rebel. So, it's kind of something she needs a therapist for. 

Since you're her big brother, she will take what you say and how you act with more emphasis than a parent. You're close in age and did it to. What she's doing isn't all that out of ordinary for a HS  student, but you may need to worry because she was a higher chance of addiction and risky behavior.  




 Good choice 




 Drugs and alcohol with mood disorders (or similar) do not mix. She'll end up feeling worse, it keep chasing the high. 




 You need to figure out yourself and who you are, not just the job you want. What you need in life should be found in some ways within your job.

A trade school or a life coach may help. 




 Two were surprising to me, still is but who cares. The other 2 I kind of l smelled something fishy, I was right. 




 Yeah, definitely. I enjoy it when we embrace and its more than just thrusting and I feel involved. I love sitting on top of him while he's sitting up against a wall or chair and riding. Same intimate feelings as missionary. 




 Really. I hate this question because they're all good. Can't be too picky 




 Mental marathon is a perfect description. This happened to me on independence day and I felt so sick, like the kind of lethargy after a panic attack. I don't have anyone to talk to anymore either. I try and people do like me and care for me, but never to the best friend/lover/first person I talk to extent. One inch at a time I will improve. I will go out. I will experience life and not take the backseat. I will think it and I will do it. 




 Oh, and as far as saint chappelle, I liked it and it was pretty quick. 




 Paris was crazy. I literally ran around the city to to each big landmark to make sure I fit it all in. Usually I'd say this doesn't work and not why I travel, but idk, I'm glad I did it. The only thing I'm mad about it not taking much time in the Louvre. That was on my bucket list but skipped through. 

Basically, its up to you. Is the culture or the landmarks more important to you, how do you feel about skipping many major places like the love lock bridge, arch, Louvre and other museums, a few awesome churches, etc. 




 Figure skating. What the fuck 




 Ask someone who has done it themselves. If you don't feel comfortable contacting an owner of a bar around you, ask around Reddit to pick some minds. 




 Yeah, my first thought as well.

But I see his point obv. 




 I bet 12% take something. 




 Because they have different priorities which changes their outlook (in theory). 




 Go on stumble upon or okay Yahtzee with buddies on your phone 




 That makes a lot of sense. 




 I hate this keyboard and autocorrect. 




 Yeah they're from my hometown and making headway across the US. Theyre one of those bands that are respected no matter if the person likes their music or not.

They told me theyd do another AMA here once their album comes out. 




 Damn. Chaturbate is going to get me into all kinds of trouble. 




 Yeah I thought it was a bent knee for about 30 seconds.  




 Got fucked over in about $250 in drug deal money through out my time. Blame it on the police 




 They have a product, I think it's called monkey butt or something similar. Made for your ass swear but works the same 




 High on what? 




 Yes, ruined my life.  




 I like Ohio. This is probably not someone's first choice but I do. 




 Reminds me of the babadook... And brainwashing. 




 And most places here will accept Canadian money. 




 I kind of think of it as my country too. I can hop the border for lunch, see the Falls anytime, and go to a specific store to pick something up for half an hour. A lot of Canadians come here as well, mostly to shop, so we integrate well. 




 As a person, how would you describe yourself? 




 Be prepared to out in more effort and work. Do participate in class, ask questions. One if the biggest things I regret was doing this and not going to a professors office hours to form a relationship. Definitely will help down the line with recommendations, plus networking is always a necessity. 

Oh, and as much as grades DO matter, if you pass you're okay and no one will care. 




 Free to be insane. Free to be unique. Obviously we have laws, but as a white female, I hide in the cracks. 




 Nope. Oatmeal could work though. 




 So what do you like to do? How do you have money? 




 Similar to any public service, I thought they were unfair until I needed them. I support it, but also believe in limitations. 




 Can't upvote enough! 




 Yeah I was hoping one she touched the memories at the beginning and made them sad, they'd make ALL them sad because that's how it feels. I looked too far into this movie psychologically  




 Love Pixar, had high expectations on this and felt let down because I was trying so hard to relate it to my brain. How did you feel about it? 




 I've had my leg hair look like that before. Winters are long and lonely. 




 A true man right here. 




 Download some podcasts or audio books 




 I like your outlook 




 Have him try this:

 Both are in the wrong. If the workers said that they should have been fired. The lady sucks though. 




 I mean let's review 




 Where's Picasso's? 




 So good.  Post pop punk is my groove. 




 No one knows my band either. Mostly because I don't have a band. 




 Not him but I am! 




 True. Theyre not my thing but it's sad how fast they faded after the hype from the song with soupy died down. 




 Only heard a few songs here and there but listened to their full albums today. So good! 









 $paid 




 $paid 




 Apparently I'm the only one that did not like this.
