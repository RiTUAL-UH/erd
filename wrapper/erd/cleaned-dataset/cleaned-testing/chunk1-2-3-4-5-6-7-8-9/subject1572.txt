 If you fly within Europe you should try ryanair.com, which is way cheaper than all the other companies in Europe  




 The beat is cool, but I think you should change the notes of the organ that comes in at 00:27, because the 3rd note doesnt seem to fit with the rest of the sounds 





























 Minigolf (If that's the word, in Dutch we call it midgetgolf) and bowling.   




 What lives in a group of berries under the sea? 




 That's why they say 14 countries, and give 16 answers 




 That was my initial thought too, but they do share a border, even though it's tiny: http://maps.google.com/?ll=42.147114,132.121582 spn=3.144103,7.064209 t=m z=7 




 Is it me or is there nothing wrong with the answer? 
























 I am working at it right now, even got the premium edition

These will keep you busy for a while 




 At the top of the step sequencer click the arrow next to pattern 1 (if your pattern is called that), and select split by channel. This will put every sound in a separate pattern, which you can then arrange in the playlist.    




 I can't believe this isn't higher up in this thread 
























 I wanted to type how he laughs but i couldn't figure out how so here is a relevant video:

 Skyline is such a bad movie, it's not even fun to watch when you are watching bad movies on purpose 




 I found an article about the bunker, are you in the picture?

It's cool though, now I know where to go when the zombie apocalypse begins :) 




 Yeah they announced it in 2011, i really hope they will release it soon. On the other hand, I still have to beat the labyrinth so i do have time to wait :) 
























 That's true, although it is suggested that  bloodtypes omit certain markers which a mosquito can detect: 
Blood-type markers are chemicals released by people of a specific blood type  so if someone with AB blood emitted a marker, it would be different than that released by B. One study found persons with Type O blood suffered more mosquito landings because of the odorant markers they emit than any other blood type, making their juices a hot commodity for blood banks, as well as Asian Tiger Mosquitoes, which carry West Nile Virus. Not only were Type Os more likely to be landed on, but the study found that for any blood type, people who secreted a chemical marker about their blood type through their skin (both blood type and secretor status are determined by genes) were bitten much more than non-secretors; 24 percent in the case of the Type Os. Other researchers estimate about 15 percent of the population, based on their genes, dont emit chemical markers of their blood type through their skin and saliva, so something else has to be calling the mosquitoes to them.

 The bowl should probably be heated to body temperature, to mimic the warmth of the human body.  




 Just keep in mind, your adjusted penis size is Length times Diameter plus Weight over Girth divided by Angle of the tip squared 




 We got kampers in the netherlands, which is pretty much the same as White trash in the states. For a very funny, over the top illustration of their behaviour watch New Kids nitro http://m.imdb.com/title/tt2043932/
Or turbo: http://m.imdb.com/title/tt2043932/
i hope there's a version with english subtitles, but both movies are definitely a good laugh 




 This is the video that taught me how to solve it, took me about half an hour the first time: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=609nhVzg-5Q
 
























 Is this for real? It seems that this is just a description of a movie. I can't find any information about it anywhere else...

Watch out, this might melt your brain 




 Although we cannot really be sure, there were people who considered doing it: 

"We do know that a supply of smallpox-infected blankets was available, since the disease had broken out at Fort Pitt some weeks previously. We also know that the following spring smallpox was reported to be raging among the Indians in the vicinity."

 How do I do that? Can I just zip the save file and upload it somewhere? 




 Initially, the hour glass shape was the mob farm, but it didn't work because it was too low (monsters would spawn in the caves below, not in the farm) so I made another mob farm on top of it, the upper most part is the chamber where they spawn, with 4 8-long and 2-wide canals that lead to the hole in the middle. And yes, sorry, everything was done with vanilla minecraft.

EDIT: Monsters spawn within a range of 144x144 according to the video I watched, but they only move when you're in range (about 32 blocks). Yet if you are to close, they don't spawn, I think they spawn when you're 24 blocks away. So I made sure that the floor of the dark room on top was 30 blocks above the floor where you can kill the mobs. Because it is so high up (the collecting floor is 72+ above the ground, to prevent monsters from spawning below) and I put torches on the ceiling and the collecting floor, they are forced to spawn in the room. 

In the room, there are 4 canals leading to the hole in the middle, which are 2 blocks deep, in order to prevent the mobs to escape. At the bottom of the tunnel, i put slabs in order to kill the monster and prevent spiders from escaping. 

This is the video which helped me a lot: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liYHNsXTcBc  




 Thanks :)  





























 Well thanks :) 




 I think you forgot that grammar is a language's logic, but downvote me all you want
