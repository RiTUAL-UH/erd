 As I said Earlier: I think that Alfred Willowhawk would really dig that response. This response is great. I have cross posted this to a couple of subreddits, and this is one of the most astute answers I have seen. Kudos and gold if I had it.

 




 /u/ChairmanMaoffin had an awesome thing to say on this 
 Evidenced-based medicine has been proposed and accepted as a more accurate name for western or conventional medicine because it describes what we do- utilize the most evidenced-based preventions and treatments for patients

I think that Alfred Willowhawk would really dig that response. What I got from this article was less about what types of medicine work for who, and more about how our terminology is aggressive and detrimental to the goal of finding the best method for treating each individual.


 




 As we close on this flu season; a word on the Conventional Medicine v Alternative Medicine, and how those terms can subconsciously break down our trust in medical procedures not labeled "Conventional". Really enjoyed this article.

Abstract

Gethin G, Cowman S. Case series of use of Manuka honey in leg ulceration. Abstract The historical and current literature reports the successful use of honey to manage a diversity of wound aetiologies. However, only in the last 40 years is research on its mode of action and contribution to wound healing being investigated. The challenge of managing chronic non healing wounds generated interest in researching non standard therapies. The aims of the study were to gain insight into the practical use of Manuka honey in wound management. The objective was to test the feasibility of further rigorous research into the use of honey in the management of chronic wounds. Instrumental case series were used to examine the use of Manuka honey in eight cases of leg ulceration. To collect the necessary data, photographs, acetate tracings, data monitoring and patient comments and observations were used to add greater reliability and validity to the findings. The wounds were dressed weekly with Manuka honey. The results obtained showed three males and five females with ulceration of different aetiologies were studied. A mean initial wound size for all wounds of 5.62 cm(2) was obtained. At the end of four-week treatment period, the mean size was 2.25 cm(2). Odour was eliminated and pain reduced. The conclusions drawn were that the use of Manuka honey was associated with a positive wound-healing outcome in these eight cases. Arterial wounds showed minimal improvement only." 




 This is correct. The idea of the article was that the lable of "alternative" has unfairly garnered the co-definition of "ineffective". Manuka honey on a staph infection heals it.  Even science agrees with that,  but its considered "alternative" because they can't patent honey and sell it for an exorbitant amount of money. The thing that I most agreed with was this assertion that our terminology may be out of date.  




 They call medicine that has worked for thousands of years in Asia "alternative" here in the west.

 An article for the perusal of the Pagan community who are interested in, or study, or would like to take sometime reading about Egyptian based Wicca and Theology. Reposted from /r/wicca 









 I thought you all would enjoy seeing this cross post from the Wiccan community on /r/wicca who are interested in, study, and revere the ancient gods of Egypt.   









 Another article for the perusal of the Wiccan community who is interested in, or study, or would like to take sometime reading about Egyptian based Wicca and Theology.  









 I think the pressure made it impossible for him to grow and perform in Cleveland. a more laid back atmosphere and time to learn without being under the microscope might produce a great QB. We have learned that Weeden does not turn into a Diamond under pressure, he crumbles. Maybe if he is allowed to age like cheese, he will ripen to a very strong and mature QB. 




 And you would be a crappy Cowboys fan if you thought differently. Huzzah and good luck on the road to that Ring! 




 I have been trying to find a place on reddit to post these wonderful articles on the items being created for Spring Mysteries Festival (www.aquatabch.org) auction. If it gets good up-votes, I will post the rest as they come out. If not, I hope you enjoy this one for it being created by the God of Craftsmen, and I will find another place to post them. blessings and I hope you enjoy :) 









 No problem, friend :)

You saw him in college. Did you think he had the goods to be a starting NFL  QB? 




 My honest reply is "No. I would not be excited to have him." His stats dont paint a whole picture. Yes he has broken passing records. Has he broken playoff records? Also: he can spend a whole game knocking down receivers (hence his stat numbers) and then the last play of the game, the one to win it all, he throws an interception,  or a really bad throw. We have Greg Little. We would need no help choking on the final throw/catch of the game. Lol Do I hate Romo?  No. I just think he is more in league with Andy Dalton than Tom Brady.  




 I am not here to change your mind about Romo,  just to talk about Weeden. 




 Weeden is indeed a low budget choice for quarterback.  Romo is not an elite QB. I'm sorry. I've had him on my fantasy team more than once, and he has let me down time and again. I don't dislike him,  or the Cowboys,  mind you.  




 Im sure he picked him with the same "I like him. He's a good 'ol boy" mentality he keeps Romo around with. I can honestly think of no other reason he would hire him. 




 I am equally as sorry that you have to deal with JJ. 




 I apologize for having to leave the comp after I started this AMA. It seems to have been the single ruining factor. I am a minister, and I cant always predict how much time I am going to have to spend on a given appointment. I'm sorry, again. Good luck with Weeden. I was hoping to be able to shine some light on him for anyone who had questions, and mishandled the instant nature of the AMA experience. Sorry to waste your time /u/Cowboys. Maybe next time. 




 Sorry.  I'm a Minister,  and my job called.  




 Fried, Floppy, Weeden Scramble 




 That's funny right there, I dont care who you are. ;) 




 My eternal apologies. I am here and hope to make amends!
 




 All of them. :) I work in Prison Ministries on Tuesday and it had me out of the house for a couple hours. 




 He needs to learn meditation and inner peace. Once he isn't afraid of the line coming at him, or the velocity of his throw, then he will have what it takes to put it all together to be a starter. 




 Weeden has a long progression, and he gets spooked easily. Many of his drops come from him throwing it too hard. (which is only half his fault. He WAS throwing it to Bess and Little, who are not the best at actually catching the ball) His sack record has a lot to do with his inability to get rid of the ball in time, and then panicking. He had Joe Thomas, Alex Mack, Greco, Schwartz. He had some good protection. He could be really good if someone could teach him. That 2012 game was a BARN-BURNER!!! 




 I had not looked into him at all. He was NOT who I, or anyone else expected to draft. I watched his college play after the fact and have always thought that we never played to his major strength, which is the Shotgun. I have felt that we hired a polar bear, and wondered why the hell it wouldnt fly in our eagle formation, and have punished the poor dumb animal for being a polar bear who cant fly. 




 I would take him over Brady Quinn, but I would take Thad Lewis over Weeden. He has a gun that he uses too liberally when a normal throw would do, and he fluffs it when he needs to drill it to a receiver. Maybe you guys can do something with him now that he is a backup, and no longer a high profile flop. 




 The game with the Dippity-Do-Underhand-Pass-Interception on first down. It was hands down one of the top 5 worst plays in Browns History.

 I have watched it all, and I will answer any questions you may have, as honestly as I can.  




 I have been working on this project! We just found out it was the 30th year anniversary when we located all the old print copies from 30 years ago, late last month! It was like looking into a time warp, and then we saw the publish date and realized we had to stop production on a myriad other things, and produce this months worth of material on Panegyria itself.  I hope you guys like what we put out here, and I hope you learn a bit about a part of pagan history 30 years in the making. 




 Im right over the mountains past Stevens Pass. There is a  HUGE Backers group that meets in Seattle at the World Sports Grill, too. Good Luck! 




 Oh yes, fuck dem birdies. 




 I bleed Orange and BROWN. That being said: Cincinnati did right by Paul Brown, and for that I respect them. Funk dem Stillers, though. 




 I say we trade our #4 pick for a first rounder for next year (to get the QB from Oregon), and then start our draft with the sec9nd first round pick, and choose any of the WR that are filling this draft. 




 I'm not your hombre, champ 




 This morning, at around 4:30, I jumped out of bed because I had some super important stuff to do, that I was obviously late for. We sleep outside in a seperate building from the house. When I got outside and looked around the twilight yard in the darkened rain pouring on my head, I realized I had nothing to do, and was wondering wtf I thought I needed to be doing, naked in the rain, at 4:30am. This has never happened before. I have Algonquin ancestry, as well. Which I just learned is a home for the some odd the Wendigo legends. Now this comes up on reddit.  Weird.

 The Official Browns App is the single most frustrating Browns news app I have. I use Fanside, Flipboard,  and b/r (bleacher report) the only thing I like about the Official Browns App is the "Breaking News" feature. It sends an alert when big stuff happens. LomBanner firing, DeQwell being let go, etc. I mean, you cant click the alert to go read an article about the alert because the app is pretty much useless, but they still send you the alert . 




 Rev. Terry Riley of March on Ft. God fame, had many doors closed to him until he was able to affirm his training through Seminary Certification. His experience and outlook is really interesting, and may help those with questions about Seminary Training vs Coven Training.  









 This is a really cool book about European Shamanism.  This author is really thorough, and more people should enjoy Mallory. What little of him I have read I have really liked. He is very scholarly in his style, and that can be a little dry for some, but for info hounds, he is great. 









 Yes,  the parent comment to yours makes very little sense.  There is no body within Wicca that can tell anyone else how to worship.  We don't have gun toting covens going door to door kicking altars over and demanding to see your ID Card, and your depictions of Aradia and Cernunnos, as
sanctioned by the Brit Trad Collective.

 Hello, everyone. I am sharing this article here because for better or worse, for those that love Pete, and those that do not, Pierre Claveloux "Pete Pathfinder" Davis changed the face of Wicca, and these may well be his final written words to the community that he loved very much. Pete has written Menhir News even before Panegyria's inception. I hope you all enjoy what might be it's final edition. 
+Blessings 









 I am a very close and personal friend of Rev. Terry Riley of SDCW. This will be the first year since I started going to Mayday that I wont be there 




 Have we met, before? 
 




 I didn't know you knew Alfred?! He's an amazing priest 




 Gotta love the ungrateful. Bye Weeden. 




 I think that Love is the Law, and we tend to withhold love from ourselves before we withhold from other people, and this makes us victims to the one person we cant fight way. This article by Alfred Willowhawk, a 3rd Degree Gardenarian from Wite Ravyn Metaphysical Church in Missouri, is a great article tackling just that concept. Happy Imbolg, everyone.

 I bet he feels like a guy who just got a chance to race the Kentucky Derby at all. Farmer seems like the kind of guy to be grateful for his chances,  and he's going to do way better than Lombardi 




 Well with Banner at the helm, you can bet he wont make it easy to resign him. Mack is worth money, and Banner historically doesn't like to pay it out. This is worth being concerned over. 




 My grandma got me this gnome for Yule and He told me his name was Gnomar Lewzing. He says he's got this. 









 As a Die Hard Dawg, I just want to say: Ravens, I'm sorry. I cant like you. I would say "Nothing Personal" but it totally is. I would say "No offense" but I cant help it if you get offended. I CAN say: I love your coach, and I think he is the best one in the whole division. Pettine might make me proud, but Harbaugh is a good guy. You also got the better of the two brothers.

Steelers. Steelers Steelers Steelers. I dont know what happened last year. Aging team, too comfortable coaching staff, karma, I dont know. I see a serious dropping in your AFC North standings if you dont make some serious changes (which I see that you have started with the coaching staff) I think you have the dirtiest coach in the AFC North. It's true. He cheats. Boo on cheating. You know, I could go on about how I am a Browns fan and hate the Steelers, but instead I am just going to say: Good luck on the rebuild.

Bengals. We share a heritage. You took in a wonderful man whom we kicked out unfairly and finished his legacy with honor. Thank you for helping immortalize Paul Brown. You guys have a chance to make it to the Super Bowl, but you are going to have to shake the rust off that Red Rifle. Not to mention I dont even know most of the people on your O-Line. (that might be my fault for being stuck up the Brownies Butt all season) Get a better secondary receiver and maybe find the Law Firm in contempt. He didnt do much to help you last season.

The Browns are ONCE AGAIN the question mark. Maybe they will dominate with a new coach, massive cap space, and 10 draft picks with 2 in the first round. MAYBE. Or will it be same post 99 Browns, different year? I dont know. We're a mess. I think Hoyer can win, but can he? He seems to get hurt easily. I think Gordon can be a game changer, but can he? We didnt win any of the games he broke records in. I think Pettine is a good coach. But will he actually be able to lead the Factory of Sadness?  

Well, thanks for letting me bitch and posture about how I feel about the AFC North. And I will leave y'all with this: I can talk trash about the AFC North, but if you aint following one of our teams, then shut yer mouth. 

Peace, All

 So many hours into Final Fantasy VII...poor Aeris. There is just so much to do in that game, and the replay value is amazing. 




 Yes! I almost never remember what I say to people in those situations. We do a ritual called The White Goddess Ritual where the priestess in the center is veiled in white, and invokes the Bright Mother. Then everyone has a chance to come up to, hug, and get an interaction with the Goddess. This one time afterwards my partner Bella had been the one invoked, and this little girl came up and said "Can I have another hug?"

And Bella said: "Okay honey, but it wont be the same. I was invoked with Goddess last time"

Then the little girl hugged her, and kinda smacked her lips like she didnt like the taste of the tea, or something, and said: "Nah. That's not right. And you had blond hair then" and just wandered off with her mom. Bella's hair was red :) 




 Someone mentioned: ["Until you started posting your blog here I wasn't really aware of how Eleusinian the Aquarian Tabernacle Church was."](http://www.reddit.com/r/Wicca/comments/1wo46e/searching_for_the_kore_by_regina_cagle/cf3uxx0), in an earlier post. LOL Sorry about the lack of context before I started posting. We just happen to be in the middle of rehearsals for Spring Mysteries Festival, so many of these posts are blogs of what each priest/ess is going through as they work with their God forms. It's a way for people to get to see the kind of transformations that occur within the people that hold these monumental energies. I have done invocation and psychodrama for 10 years, and the changes and growth that happen through the process of working these energies is really amazing sometimes. Like Anansi says when he shares a story: "This is my story as I have told it. If it be sweet, or if it be not sweet; take some with you, and let some come back to me". One of the things I was hoping to hear from people was their experiences holding energies in their own psychodramas and rituals. I'd love to hear stories from anyone who would like to share. :)

 You're very welcome. We are moving in directions that are not nearly parallel to the ATC of the past. Are we still trying to break ground for Wiccan Rights? Yes. Are we still trying to put out the best resources we know how to? Yes. Are those resources, and ground breaking going to be done in the same manner as the past. Most likely not. We are pretty much only ATC in name and possessions.

Talking about the Seminary: The Seminary has been staffed by hand picked teachers (many of which are not a part of the ATC Mother Church in WA, but by teachers from all over the country, and some not associated with the ATC through anything except the Seminary) by Bella for the past 5 years. Not only that, but the Seminary doesnt teach a tradition. We teach what are the Sacred Sciences behind magic. We leave it to the individual group leaders to teach a tradition. We also do not Initiate through the school (because it is mostly online) though a student has the ability to find a local teacher because of the scope of the ATC affiliate network.

The ATC cant decide to not use it's name any longer. The disaster that would come in the wake of such a decision would be apocalyptic. It's not just us in Washington anymore. The dissolution of the ATC would effect thousands of congregants world wide. The name (as besmirched as it may be in certain circles) is connected to Governmental infrastructures that would disenfranchise dozens of groups that depend on us if we were to not maintain the Umbrella Document as it is written.

It was only through all of the infrastructure the ATC built that we were able to get legal churches in the Mid-South. Tennessee Religious law is INSANE. It is made to keep non-Abrahamic religions out of the loop. It's actually only because of the legitimacy of the seminary that The Jenny Jones Show (I need citation on the actual show. Might be Sally Jesse Raphael, might be Maury Povich. Terry Riley knows) said they would be willing to call Terry "Rev. Terry Riley" and not "Self Proclaimed Witch Terry Riley". It's a crazy story that I would love to get my hands on and post here. 

At this stage in the game, the only hope I have is by changing a complete culture that some people see within the organization that I love. There was a time when it was run my a closed fist. We could not do things more differently if we were an open hand. Love is our law, and just like the reputation that I have learned of, was built brick by brick, action by action, so shall it be disassembled. The ATC was ever only supposed to bring legitimacy and resources to the community, and as I sit here and tell you now please believe me: That is how the world will see it when I am done. 

Blessings to you, and I hope I have done some to help you have, maybe, a glimmer of hope that the Aquarian Tabernacle Churches future will make you far prouder than anything that may have existed in the past. 




 Even if you believe Pete Davis is not Brit Trad, Belladonna Laveau is and she is the Archpriestess and Pete is Retired. Not that it matters, but Pete is initiated into the Kent Tradition of Wicca, as well as by Raymond Buckland, as well as Gypsy Ravish. Also, our 501 (c) 3 is not the same as a regular one. Its a common misconception that even the State offices make when we are affiliating new churches. Every time they talk the new affiliate into not filing the correct paper work, because not even the clerks are familiar with it. Its a rare classification, I can understand the confusion. 

On the topic of Woolston Steen Theological Seminary: @ $39.00 a month when compared to any other college that offers Associates through Doctorate (Cherry Hill is a Masters and Doctorate program only) WSTS prices are almost free at less than $500 a year. Cherry Hill costs $95 a unit hour, which ends up being far more expensive per class, as well as being inaccessible for people without a Bachelors degree. 

 The ATC is not the same that it was 10 years ago. It's not the same as it was even a year ago. 

There is a world of bad blood that we are cleaning up from Petes time; many blockages that the community has placed in the way of the ATC because of whatever it was that Pete did/said/acted like to upset those around him. I invite you to get in line so that we can do our best to patch up any wounds that you may have from past experiences, Bella and I have been spending the last year doing just that with the other community members who have the same issues. All we are trying to do is be accessible to the community, build our local communities (both magical as well as mundane), and help empower others to be successful. 

And I would love to talk to you privately if you would wish to write me, but thought I should address your concerns in the same forum that they were raised. I don't know how the Aquarian Tabernacle Church was done before, but you might want to check us out again before you decide what we are and aren't. The times they are a changing. Blessings.

 I wonder if this would hold up in American courts? 









 This series of articles is supposed to follow the Egyptian Wheel of the Year. She told me she had not seen the content elsewhere, and wanted to make it available as the wheel turned, this year. :) 




 That may be true wherever you are from, but from the moment they stepped off the boat to escape religious persecution, Pagans have been political in America. Wicca may be 60 years old, but Americas Pagan roots are hundreds of years old. In America, if it wants to be relevant for another couple hundred years, then we need to make sure our voices are heard. 




 SMH. That's not hostility. All I've tried to do is participate in this community. I've only been here for about a week. People have voted every one of my posts up to #1 status, post after post. Dozens of people vote them up, yet the comments from 3 or 4 of the same people, over and over, seem to be disparaging, critical, or made to put a person on the defensive. I dont know what I did originally, but I'm sorry. I never meant to flare that nerve. And I'm sorry for pushing back instead of being receptive from the get go. I have not had a chance to peruse through the content here. I help run a huge church (in size, not wealth) that takes up a large portion of my time. I am working on learning the lines for a 4 day long play, in which I'm playing Herakles. Not to mention there is the Boy Child who has to be taken to school every day and picked up after band. It was never my intention NOT to contribute. I talk on Facebook all day. It was only ever my intention to contribute. I hear that it's important to add to the dialogue. My only objection has ever been that I have a natural 'push back' against being told what to do. I'm an Aries. LOL But I have a Pisces Rising, and an Aquarian Moon, so I am super sweet when I'm not cornered, and my friends are more important to me than just about anything. I want to have the people here to be part of those friends, and if we can move forward, I would love to make that happen. 




 (I am being sincere) Is a self populated rss feed the same as a multi-author website?
 




 I was on WifeSwap. If anyone has any questions about that, I would be happy to answer them. 

My personal favorite Witchcraft in the media was the episode of Charmed where they went back to Salem, and their powers didnt work. They had to use the craft of the day, because their powers didnt exist yet. So they had to do a protection spell, and so they cut an apple in half, exposing the pentacle in the center, and held a piece of Basil against it, and it made a protection spell. It was TOTALLY magically sound. Apples are immortality magic. The pentacle  in the center is the same as a pentacle in a circle which means "All four elements and spirit in perfect harmony" which makes things manifest. Basil is used to dispel negativity. So Immortality magic+Dispelling negativity+a manifestation circle(pentacle in circle)=Protection from evil. I was impressed. (both with the show, and my training. LOL) 




 The ATC is a 33 year old church, and the only one in the world with an "Umbrella Tax Exemption" which means that affiliates can get legal status through us, instead of the Fed. It is a REALLY rare classification that not even all the Christian Churches have. It is why we have as many rights, Wicca wide, as we do. The ATC and their status with the government enables ALL WICCAN CHURCHES AND PRACTITIONERS to be seen as legit. I hope that helps :) 




 I will do NOTHING to prove you wrong. "I reddit because I have things to share". Not "I reddit at your behest." I have read your past posts, and if people lived according to your weird views of life, I would be afraid of who I am, and hide my faith to protect myself from ridicule. You have suggested to new pagans to hide the symbols of their faith:

"I know, we have just as much right to wear a symbol of our faith as any other. And being out in the public helps fight the hate. If you know us, you don't hate us.
The person spewing bigoted remarks is entirely responsible for their hateful behavior. But knowing that these confrontations will occur while wearing the symbol. One has to ask one's self why they are wearing the pentacle and if they should continue.
I stopped wearing mine because I realized I had a chip on my shoulder and was begging the world to pick a fight with me. "

I think your attitude IS the chip on your shoulder. Dont blame your pentacle for people picking a fight with you. If you treat people irl the way you treat people online, I cant imagine you get much purchase with them. 

Further delving into your posting past shows that to follow you is to believe that Wicca is a club of intelligent solitaries, and megalomaniacal group leaders. 

"Covens can be a more structured environment to learn Wicca and see it in practice, but in my experience getting involved with a coven is a crap shoot. The best covens function as a group of friends, whereas ones made up of the public, or acquaintances can break down rather dramatically. Internal drama and megalomaniacal personalities are likely issues. "

I especially like where you speak for all of Wicca (which you seem to get REALLY bent about when you read what you perceive as people doing just that)

"Wicca is a highly unstructured religion."

The reason you enjoy the benefits that all the other major religions enjoy is because of the Highly Structured Churches of Wicca fighting for your rights. All you are doing is lying to new Wiccans, implanting your own psychosis and fears onto people who have come to this site looking for help, info, or support on their path, and driving away established churches/groups/people who would lend credibility to a number of the discussions that you are regurgitating on. Every page of your history has at least one comment where you are trashing someone and telling them to buy ad space for reddit. THATS spam, sir. You. You are playing the reddit police, and it seems by a few deleted OP's accounts, that you scare some of them. Bully on you. I cant believe you havent been reported yet. 

So anyone reading: I am a 3rd degree Gardenarian. My lineage is through Ed Fitch and Janet Farrar. I cant speak for anyone else but myself, and myself is a Wiccan with STRONG lineage who works every day to further Wicca. You speak for ALL OF WICCA and you tell untruths. 

You constantly rail about how you are Wiccan, but dont follow the major beliefs: "As I have so frequently said in this forum, I am Wiccan and I don't believe in magic"

Well Patricia Crowther details in "Covensense" that if you feel the need to change the BOS, then you arent Wiccan, so think on that when you're telling all these new people that they dont need to be Wiccan to be Wiccan.

So: You want dialogue? We're having dialogue. Lets start one about how you make /r/wicca a hostile environment for new people, and how that's against reddiquette. 

 




 I find it fascinating that the God forms of Spring Mysteries manifest in their priests/priestesses, in ways that go hand in hand with the archetypes. But Magic doesnt work, right? ;) 









 This sounds like professional jealousy.  We are rocking it with front page worthy content, and it seems to not be sitting well with some. Also: we don't profit off of traffic to our site. All of that content is put there for the community, not to line our pockets. I'm going to keep posting until I break a rule, (speaking of which the rule about posts/replies needing to be constructive might pertain to your post, as all it has done is trash a Wiccan news source and try to shame it into not posting on an open Wiccan forum) and thanks: maybe I'll buy some ad space to show my support. But the last thing I will do to "support reddit" is discontinue posting. Bless your heart.  




 I dont think the Gods understand "Next time" I think they are stuck in a perpetual cycle. As soon as Persephone has returned and begins making flowers, it is like she is the Kore again and has never left. Demeter would never think "I cant bear to lose her again!", because she never HAS lost her to that point.  




 I think that's an awesome idea. Maybe an amendment to the site posting rules? Also: more than 75% of my posts will be from Panegyria.com just like certain people only really post from Patheos, or any number of other pagan sites. I work at the Aquarian Tabernacle Church in the social media department. Our social media has been nonexistent for many years. I am changing that reality :) My point of posting is to share with the rest of the Wiccan community the amazing people that post through our online magazine. (to which we are always looking for spirited contributors) Though we do not have an Original Poster clause, 99% of our content cannot be found anywhere else on the net. My point of sharing it here is to give the community the best possible chance to have access to this content, and to create discussion about the topics there-in. If you would like a little write up before each one though, I am happy to do such. :)  




 It's pagan content from a Wiccan church. I didnt know I had to post a reason with it. I've been all over the site rules and the reddiquette, and nothing says there has to be statement of reason for choosing to post. I dont really have a problem posting why I am posting. I see that you are a moderator. I read over all the rules before I began posting, and have adhered to them. If anything anywhere had mentioned that we needed a reason to post something, I would have been doing it from the start. Is this just a personal thing, or is this a site wide known thing that is an "unwritten rule"? 



















 I came away with much to say after a good debate of ideas on an earlier thread. 














  The ATC doesn't represent all of Wicca. If the writer is referring to ATC, then they should make that very clear. All of these issues could have been fixed by using words that don't generalize us all. "Most Wiccans," "Some Pagans," "We at the ATC."

I can totally understand why the above remark generated inside of you. The ATC doesnt speak for all Wiccans. And since Wiccans by definition are 
(supposed to be) self responsible it can turn some folks off if they think people are trying to be their voice. When it comes to the Government the ATC is who they listen to about Wicca because it is the ATC that has been the engine behind almost every inch of ground Wicca has gained in their eyes. Even if The ATC doesnt speak for you directly, their contributions to you help you every day. 

There is just too many folks attacking us from the outside for us to bicker and play King of the Hill. We are all helping each other out. Many people have done much. The Author of this article is an ATC fan. He credits the structure of the church for making it possible for Pagans to exist in the open, in the Mid South. The Arkansas/Missouri/Tennessee area is very volatile, and have a lot of criteria for churches that only the unique structure of the Aquarian Tabernacle Church was able to meet. Also, when marched against a whole City, and  it was do or die, he sent out letters to everyone he could think of to help him. Only the ATC responded. It ended up being one of the greatest victories for Wicca that no one knows about, so is a bit of a cheerleader for them in that regard. 

It's nice to meet you, btw. I saw that you are a Super Virgo. (I looked at some of your posts) I have No Virgo anywhere in my chart, [Aries/Sun,Pisces/Rising,Aquarian/Moon] but it is nice to meet you, and I hope we can continue to have really enjoyable discourse. We dont all have to agree, but I hope we can all get along through the process :) Blessings 




 The Aquarian Tabernacle Church and Pete Pathfinder Davis have done, as far as I can tell by looking at history, far more with far less scandal than the Frosts. Veterans Tombstone Pentacle, only .edu sponsored pagan seminary, umbrella 501 (c) 3 which just by the ATC having it, it gives all of Wicca privileges that other pagan religions don't enjoy in the eyes of the government, prisoner rights for incarcerated pagans, and a myriad other accomplishments from the making it safe to be open in the Mid-South, to defending churches from all denominations (Pagan to Christian and back again) from unfair laws levied against home worship. I think few people throw Pete's name around in the circles of Pagans changing the world, because his ministry has always been behind a desk and not in front of a camera. The video of him posted earlier in the month was the first video of him I have ever seen, though I have enjoyed the benefits of his accomplishments every day I have been a Pagan. Which is every year of my life since I was 5. I think that Pete has always been an administrative Pagan. Raymond Buckland called him one of the most influential Pagans in history. His life before Paganism was one of political service. He was the mayor of Hanover, NJ. No democrat had been elected as mayor in that town for over 100 years, until he ran. He kept the job until he decided not to run again. Wicca may not seem political, but as Wiccans we are charged with keeping the balance. The People in here may or may not be correct about there being/not being a conspiracy concerning Christians and the government, but we are woefully short of Pagan politicians on either side of the isle. That's an imbalance. Pete has always told me (because I've been lucky enough to know the man) that you get more done in a tweed jacket and leather elbow patches than you can get done in a cape. He means that we need to get out there into the real world and make our lives and beliefs a parallel to the places we live in. Its no longer shocking that were Pagan. Now that we can get past meeting someone workout them freaking out about our beliefs, some of us are ready to have a say at the school board, or in city council, or on higher levels of government. 




 One must also remember that the writer of the original post is located within the Mid South in the Jonesboro, AR area. The author in question also led one of the most violently protested (by very angry Christians) marches in Wiccan History:
[ http://www.childrenofthecircle.com/videos.htm ] I am happy that the post has made people talk. I personally cant see Wicca as NOT a nature religion, since everything we do is based on the cycles of the seasons. Sabbats fall on Astrological dates (0 degrees Aries is Ostara, 15 degrees Taurus is Beltain, etc.) that coincide with harvests, livestock and planting schedules. All the creatures of the Earth are the voices, heartbeat, and children of The Lord and the Lady. In my humble opinion.  














 Hello, all! I work with The Woolston-Steen Theological Seminary (WSTS) @ WiccanSeminary.EDU We are a college offering degrees from Associates to Doctorate in Wiccan Ministries. We do not offer Degreed Elevations DIRECTLY. We have teachers from all over America, in Canada and in Australia. Teachers have the right to take on any student from the school that they find to be appropriate for training with them. So through the school, you are able to not only acquire your legal degree, but to find the teacher that is right for you. We do online course work through Second Life, which allows us to have tangible, virtual, classrooms in which you attend your courses.

In keeping with tradition as much as is possible while still keeping with the forward thinking needed to navigate an increasingly cyber world, none of our degreed elevations are done online, and must be done in person. You can attend the entirety of the College online, but to obtain your ordination through a High Priestess and High Priest, it must be done in person. This is the benefit that WSTS has in being sponsored by the ATC, which boasts a myriad churches around the country: It is increasingly easy to pair you up with someone local to you.

Our .EDU domain was entrusted to WSTS directly from the US Government to denote the validity of our school, and that anyone who was searching for a valid Wiccan seminary, would be able to do so at a glance. We are incredible reasonably priced (less than $1000 a year). We also have work scholarships for those who meet the financial requirements. I hope this helps anyone who has been looking for something like Woolston-Steen, and if you happen to need something different we wish you blessings on finding your path, and we cant wait to see you there as we walk it ourselves. Peace, Love and Light. 














 I see all the people who habitually surrender out of their games posting here, and I understand that you wouldn't want to be penalized, but the game ending and the lobby popping up before the game is over is penalization for those that dont have endless time to play. Some of us dont get to get home from school/work and just veg on smite. The people who want to play a game through to the end are already copping a punishment, so why should the people who cant make it a whole game be off scott free? If there was a penalty of some sort, people would think before casting a vote 10 minutes into a conquest match before anyone has even lost a tower. And people shouldnt be penalized for not surrendering. The point is to PLAY  the game.  




 I have been in too many conquest games where people vote to surrender as soon as it gets difficult. More than half the time no one has even lost a tower, or our team is actually ahead in position, but maybe behind in total gold and levels. What's more: more often than not we end up winning the matches that we stay in. It makes me think poorly of my teammates when the surrender is used like a reset button, willy nilly. I think the peraon who initiates the surrender, as well as everyone who votes to uphold the surrender, should incur a goodwill loss. It doesnt hurt their bottom line, its just a reminder that its unsportsmanlike to constantly leave games before youve seen them through to the end. 




 Just want to point out that through Woolston-Steen you can get a legal Associates through Doctorate degree, as well as have the opportunity to meet a dozen possible teachers that WILL take students down a 1st-3rd initiatory path. Those Degrees are not charged for. The only money charged is for the College itself (because it is a real college with a .EDU website and license from the state to award legal degrees.) Blessings, and I hope that helps! 





























 Yeah,  because I was confused,  too. Thank you for the explanation! 




 We might need to highlight this post as it gives twitter handles for people to send suggestions to with ideas on improving the Browns fan experience. This is a powerful thing that I don't think many teams have. *EDIT: spelling* 




 I think your text length was just fine. I have no problem with off field antics that dont hurt anybody. People live life and they make mistakes and people deal with pain and recreation differently. I think in the grand scheme of things we have a guy who likes to party hard when he's not succeeding at football spectacularly, and a relatively low key guy who smokes weed and blows it up on the gridiron.  I dont think either of them are being detrimental to the team, currently. I do have a bias: I live in Washington and am witnessing how benign the transition has been of legalized marijuana. One day I think this will be a highly antiquated conversation. I think it will be within the next decade that we will see major changes, and probably sooner than that. Now IM sorry for the text wall! 




 I personally think that the NFL marijuana policy is the part that is out of line, in my personal opinion. Even Goodell knows, I believe. Neither of them is doing anything that I see as detrimental to their game, or others, yet. 









 Thank you for your diligence  




 I appreciate your diligence in learning the unfortunate truth that I myself learned: He doesnt exist.

 I feel about the Steelers the way Vegita feels about Goku (Dragon Ball Z reference). He can hate him, but you dont know shit about him, so stay back. If anyone is going to dis the Steelers, its us. We have to play them 2 times every year, forever. There is a hidden honor there. We hate them the way brothers who have had a falling out hate. If anyone else trash talks them, I get offended and think "They dont have any right to trash talk the Steelers. I have a right to trash those bastards, but your Charger lovin' ass can stuff it." With that said, we have to honor our opponents that deserve honoring,  and celebrate their lives once they pass. They put up with our bickering, and they understood us better than anyone else in the league. And for that I honor a man who took his team to 4 Super Bowls. Be at peace,  Chuck. Steelers Heaven is undoubtedly welcoming you in grand style. 














 Remove the teachers and make them Mentors. Demand excellence in Math, Science, Social Studies, Sports and the Arts, but dont force a curriculum. Give the children choices and allow them to create the education they want. Make it a forum where the kids choose the direction they want thwir studies to go. Have American History, but allow the child to decide what parts they want to learn. If they dont care about the Dust Bowl, but spend 4 years learning about Ohio Railroads, the only thing that does is make them a walking resource on a subject that they are passionate about, instead of wasting 4 years teaching them a little bit about everything they dont care to remember. Don't make them read "The Wind in the Willows", make them have to read something that interests them. Be there as a guide to help them find knowledge for themselves, and ditch standardized testing. Train the Mentors in how to give a written assessment,  and then give the kids a real grade that isnt attached to a letter, but to a document that details their attitude and accomplishments and if they have learned the fundamentals to move to the next level of resources, then syart suggesting things that seem to flow with what they already seem to be doing. Every reading assignment is from a famous American author? Suggest some Tom Wolfe. The student seems to gravitate toward modern sci-fi? Suggeat some classic Asimov to round out their education. That is the difference between a Mentor and a Teacher. A Mentor helps you discover the world in which you can flourish and find things that bolster your knowledge. A Teacher stands in front of you and helps you learn a set of knowledge that is pre planned by someone who makes curriculums for a living. Also, as a parent of 3 "No Child Left Behind" age children, I would ditch it so fast. 2 of them dont read well, and the third only does because he plays video games. That program is "Leave All the Children Behind and Forget About Their Whole Generation" but that might be a little political there at the end.

 I see in the news that the balance is further exerting itself, today. All 3 running backs, now? I hate it for, y'all. 




 I was homeless for a good part of my tween and teen years. I am also from Ohio. Well, it's cold in Ohio, and being homeless doesn't confine itself to when it's warm. This makes for a lot of cold winter nights; lonely and alone. I used to talk to the Moon and Orion every night in the winter, that they were out. The problem is Orion is only out in the cold months,  and I was homeless and in need of someone to talk to all the time, so when I turned 18 I got him tattooed in dots and lines on my forearm. This way I had him with me always.  I got the idea when I saw a friend at a festival with him tattooed on his ankle. My friend is a Sagittarius,  and so his Orion is the Archer version.  Mine is the Lion and Club version.  




 Wow...the Gyro...womp. Good call. 




 As a person who loves the Browns, and as a native of Kent, Ohio (Kent State Flashes) my favorite is my flair: #16 Mr. Joshua Cribbs. A walk on, home town, Special Teams, sensation that many believe caused the new blocking rules on kick returns; forever letting it be known in Cleveland as "The Cribbs Rule" because of how it dramatically decreased his effectiveness. But this does not change how I feel about him. He would have been a shoe in for Canton if he had won a ring, and may still, but either way, Cribbs is my boy.

 Posting it to /r/Browns because its the gospel, not the votes.  









 The Ravens were created after Baltimore made a deal with the Devil. So many angry  prayers smoldered through the earth into the bowels of the Devils play place. Day and night he was assaulted with the lamentations of the lost souls, pining for their Colts. Finally the Son of Light heard a call that would end his suffering: Art Modell was weak, and was begging for release. So Lucifer, that wily old devil, whispered into the ears of each of the most powerful people in Baltimore and within the Browns, and a deal was struck! That deal included 2 SB, and safety from any lasting harm that may come against any of his players and original staff that took part in the move. In return the Browns would move to Baltimore, and in a seperate trade for his immortal soul Belichick obtained his own deal, but that will be a story for another day. And so it was that a faithful and historic football city the likes of Cleveland was stripped of their team, and Baltimores prayers were answered. But oldschool fans know in their hearts which side answered their prayers that day.  It is within each true original Baltimore Colts fan. That seed. That knowledge that it was not a godsend. It came from the other direction. And they know when he came to collect. The Super Bowl in the Super Dome. That light failure was no fluke. That was the Prince of Darkness showing up to watch the final moments of his deal. You won. And so did he. And now that Devils deal Baltimore made has come around to the other side, as all deals eventually do. I have a feeling that you will be seeing much more of this as the balance exherts itself. Safe travels, friends.

 I like Grossi 




 In 1983 my grandparents were friends with the equipment manager of the Browns. He left with the Ravens and is still their equipment manager. He had me decked out in Browns gear from the crib onward. Let the fair weather fans come out. More orange and brown for er'body! 




 I was going off of the news report that I read earlier about them telling him that CLE is a working town. It reminded me that few people get anything handed to them in NE Ohio. We make people who become presidents and astronauts because we know that hard work and dedication breed success. We want Johnny to be a success.

*edit: its not about "Making him pay for it". That was really thrown around by the media.  Its about learning. I understand lineage. Manzeil isn't just sitting on the sidelines, he's learning from Hoyer, who learned from Brady, who learned from Belichick. This is putting Johnny into that lineage and is part of what has the chance to take him from "Possible Great" to "Amazing"* 




 The media wants Manzeil to pay the Gold Price for his spot on the roster and to shine like the football savior of Cleveland. The Browns want him to pay the Iron Price and to work hard to become great, like a lump of fine metal forged into a powerfully sharp razors edge. 




 He can't get fucked because he's eating dirt while we are here to talk about him. His basic perpetual removal from Canton runnings is his well earned legacy. *EDIT Spelling* 




 Those things are the s*it

 I just found this sane and informative article by a news source so far removed from Ohio that they can only be considered "National". Lets leave some positive comments on this one. You can only read 5 of their articles in 30 days. Go Browns!

 I see where you're coming from,  and I personally think they are mosquitos,  but just because someone is into art and design doesn't automatically mean they are doctoring photos. Maybe a life long love of photography was the thing that inspired this person to go into arts and design.  Chances would be they had taken a lot of pictures in their life,  probably more than the average person. Just a question of odds says they have a better chance of capturing an anomaly due to the sheer volume of pictures taken.

 Has anyone been keeping up on his crusade on Wikipedia? He has made some pretty high level computer hacker type enemies through it. I dont know if there is a correlation. I just know that he has been attacking right wing anti-pagan Wikipedia editors who have been systematically getting pagan pages taken down, through the abuse of the rules system. It even caused one of them to get their real life persona outed, and themselves banned from Wikipedia. Planting pictures on someones computer doesnt take Anonymous level hacking skills. Did someone actually do that *shrug* I'm a bit of a conspiracy nut, so maybe/maybe not. This is just something that went through my head.  *edited for spelling*

 ###"Never Date a Writer" inspired by the works of "xstephens"

Never date a writer,    
no just never date a writer.    
It's been spoken at least once before,    
I know this;    
I'm inspired.    
If it's their ire you inquire,    
then you might just catch on fire    
In some sultry sleazy novel    
that goes screaming down the wire    
They'll start writing    
and just writing    
Diatribes that are so biting    
Of your hip size    
and your thigh size    
of that surprise between your thigh size    
Oh he's right!    
that writer writes    
about his libel barks and bites    
and as I sit here quite a quiver    
at this feeling he's delivered    
of his maddened observation    
that has taken hold his liver    
and contrived his consternation    
That has brought me such Elation!    
For it's true    
I say it's true    
as a peddler of my whimsy    
that at times a writer can be trite    
Our ego's may be flimsy    
So our hero's in our story    
tend to hint at lusted glory's    
we may wish we had the livers    
to stand proudly and deliver    
And our villains may resemble    
those that made us shake and tremble    
And so I ramble on the merits
of this Shakespearean Degenerate (that's 'day-djo-nare-it' for the non bourgeoisie)    
and you have grinned and bared it    
So there's one more thing I share:    
The street it goes two ways    
as the pen it streaks the paper    
Not always are the ones close by    
the Mobster or the Raper    
you're the ones who create the sonnets    
the inspirers of Romances    
You bring about our ecstasy    
as our paper and quill dances    
so thank you for your sacrifice    
Our art exists by you.    
You light our fuse    
You are our muse    
We love you.    
I swear we do...     




 A wonderful poem about the Mother. 









 Ive been reading your post history to find out if you are as aggressive and attacking to others as you have been to me. Turns out youre worse. You say some of the nastiest, meanest, and unhelpful things and you do it all over reddit and you do it thinking you are correct for trashing the folks you do. You trash people who think differently than you, and your posts are often just mean and belittling. "GTFO"? Why would you cuss that at someone or attack people, period? I thought that was against reddicate and against most subreddit rules. I think a long walk and maybe some medical marijuana might help you. Good luck. I know you'll most likely lash out at me, as is you M.O. or tell me that medical marijuana has no positive studies and that I'm an idiot. Thats okay. Ive gotten used to you and I now see that you cant help but be combative, and reddit is probably how you discharge all that negativity so that it doesn't effect your walking life (if you have one, because the level of negative interactions you have daily on reddit suggest you may ONLY  have this outlet to relieve yourself of the poison that your personality creates within you.) Bless your heart, it must be hard to have to force feed your opinions with a sledgehammer to those that dont think the way you do. Good luck, again, and may reddit protect its charges from the worst of your aggression. 




 A wonderful poem about the Mother. 









 I dont know if you are American or not, but I learned on a recent trip (my firs) to Canada how subliminal words can be. In Canada they have the same red circle and white line through the middle "Do Not Enter" street signs, but they do not say "Do Not Enter" on them. They just assume you know what it means, and they don't add that added line of, what I learned after not being subjected to it for 2 weeks is, aggression. I found this article to be saying the same thing: "Our wording is detrimental" I haven't said anything, and I don't believe the article said anything about any medical treatment being wrong, or inappropriate. the main point I saw was the need for a change in our verbiage, and I agree. 




 I'm not saying it isnt "profitable", it's just not "cornerable"; Which I should have been more clear on. And here are a couple links about case studies on Manuka honey and would healing.
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16722850
http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1742-481X.2012.01082.x/full (Though to be fair you have to subscribe to read this one)
And this more illustrated and nsfw link: http://www.medline.com/media/mkt/pdf/Therahony-study.pdf 




 I think much of the problem is you cant patent manuka honey. It just kills staph infections, and theres no way to capitalize on it monetarily. Same with reiki, chiropractics and homeopathy; iteslf around since the 1800's with 100's of positive case studies. You just cant patent and control the medicine. 
























 Yes we lost, but we lost with 24 unanswered points in the last 4 seconds to a field goal. Yes we have things to fix, but our receiving corps isnt really one of them in the way that we thought. With Tate down the Ground Pound that is West and Crowell was AMAZING amassing TD's and Yards against the vaulted LaBeau DEF like they were a collegiate team. HOYER THE DESTROYER broke bad in the second half in a serious way. This isnt a bullshit team, and it's gonna get easier from here. *EDIT: Spelling and GO BROWNS*

 




 
Yes
 




 No. That was as a flop, or being scared, or actually being payed by the Steelers on the sly.  Did you SEE how fast his head whipped around to watch the play unfold? That play has "sketchy weirdness" all over it. Either by him not really wanting to play football for a living, or by him throwing this game.  




 I cant even tell they are happening. 




 Like how people still talk about Big Ben and his sexual improprieties? Yeah. Some people just dont shutup. 




 I see you DROPPIN' his name.  




 You're a good man for trying!
 




 Thank you!
 









 I'm there with ya.

 You seem like a man who can find things. My girlfriend has agreed to a Browns Emblem on the car. I want a Chrome Brownie so bad I can taste it, but they are nowhere to be found. Can you find it, sir? Can. You? *edit:spelling*

 




 It's awesome. It's huge, hard to get a table and FULL

 If it makes the Yinzers waste practice reps and brain power to prepare for something that (I hope) doesn't happen, then "more's the better" *EDIT: They will be ready for it all game, and if we don't give it to 'em, then we just caused them extra stress before every play, all game*
 




 I forget that not everyone has the same way of dealing with problems by using humor, that I do. Some people are really hurt by the losses and the problems,  and I don't want to upset them.  I just travel a lot. A lot.  You have to have a good sense of humor, and thick skin, being a Browns fan on the road. And we are Shakespearian in our comedy of errors, sometimes, that I cant help but see the humor.  




 I would have voted for one of each, had there been an option. 




 Right on. I'm just trying to be goofy and bring some levity to the forum, but I am NOT trying to be disrespectful. This place rules and I love being a part of it. I can message y'all if I'm being inappropriate. *edit: SP*

 




 And yet the down votes pour in. LOL. Go Browns. *EDIT: And thank you*
 




 It's a deep level of 'funny' that we didn't fill out the score and place the lone 'W' next to the Bears. We are quick to put the losing scores in, but we subconsciously worry about claiming our victories. Probably because we all think the Browns are the only team in the NFL that could blow a 19 point lead a week after the game's over.  




 I totally stole yours this year

 I personally already think he would look good in that pass rush of ours,  and we already are a media storm,  so....

 I think that after seeing another "Indians go 6-3 probably higher than most Browns scores by halftime" posts on twitter I just snapped a little this morning, and it was early. I have since learned who he is. /r/Browns is the place to learn whatever you dont know about the organization. He seriously just has never really come across my feeds. I'll have to search him out actively for a bit and check him out
 




 Nah, I don't work in sports.  




 Maybe he's just learned how to use Bleacher Report (LOL joke) 




 That is surprising as hell, to me. I live on social media. It's my job. I never see this guys name. I see Plain Dealer, ESPN, Beacon Journal all over my feeds. I never see this guy.  *EDIT: upvoting /u/brownielf for the heads up*
 




 There's always the Titans. 




 All of the sudden this chuckle head has a lot to say about the Browns. All bad. Never heard of him. He just shows up a week or so ago and is just running his mouth. Is he a newspaper reporter? Blogger? Candied Apple salesman in the Muni lot with an ignorant and public opinion? At least Mike Freeman constantly talks shit because he is actively scouting the Browns to find our faults. This guy Tom Reed comes out of nowhere like an "old hand" spraying cat shit. Blarggh. 




 I was good for 3 of those B4B pics. Nice compilation :) 




 Its also titled "Allegedly caught". I can see that SOMEONE doesnt WANT TO BELIEVE.
 




 No, this is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIwgnpTNUkQ 




 Boobs were great during the Reddit Growth Drive, and I will upvote any new submissions, but I am all about it being a seasonal thing. It is like Christmas, or Taco Tontos being closed on Sundays: It keeps things fresh and doesnt allow us to just totally run something awesome into the dirt. 

TL:DR
1: Will upvote boob pics
2: Thinks keeping Boobs 4 Browns seasonal is the way to go
3: Will upvote new boob pics
*edit: grammar* 




 Did you read the part where I said I was a Hoyer fan? You sound like the clown, yinzer. 




 I think he might actually be the Personification of Brownie. Brownies are helpers who thrive on chaotic situations, *like the story of the brownies fixing all the cobblers shoes*, and he seems to only get better when things are falling down around his head; which makes him almost TOO powerful while playing for Cleveland. 
*edit: spelling* 




 I am a Hoyerastafarian. I think he is the right QB to lead this team. With that said: How the hell is Johnny so accurate on the run, throwing across his body, with feet jumbled around like a river dancer?  









 As a Buckeye fan, this constant butt kicking we get from the Steelers makes me feel like Michigan....I am ready for the turn around!

 Browns fan for 31 years, my family are personal friends with the Equipment Manager from the pre '99 Browns (who is still the Equipment Manager for the Ratbirds) and I have been wearing orange and brown singe I was in diapers, but no: this part of life has eluded me. I feel a completeness.

 He is a local,  and he is schizophrenic. He had never talked to me before (I'm new in town) and today he came up to me and told me about "Sound and Light Terror Grids" he says they are compressing light and sound within these grids, and that it is an attempt to make us blind and deaf. He says that only special breathing patterns,  and REALLY clean water can help prevent it. He also told me they have been working these things on us since we were little. I don't discount crazy. I do however run it by reddit. 




 Its true. My exploits on reddit often take me to making fun of Ravens fans, which is a celebrated pastime in Cleveland. Since it doesn't get me just over flowing buckets of upvotes, (as you can see on both your post and this one) maybe I'm just doing it because I enjoy sharing, and not because I am garnering some kind of up vote support. I get my life fulfillment from traveling, my job as a minister, and having sex with my wife. This is what I do for fun, not validation. So drop the down vote. Ravens suck. Lol. 
*edit spelling* 




 This is not Rallying the troops. This is sharing. Rallying would be if I was asking you to do, anything. Sorry if I offended your reddit sensibilities, /u/chuckyjc05 I'm really just sharing exploits of a Browns fan on reddit with the subreddit for the Browns. 




 I made a comment on the fact that the Ravens are in 32nd place for Reddit growth. I just wanted to share the exchange. Heres the link: 

http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/2ei4v1/subreddit_growth_results_after_the_third/cjztgvu 




 I made a Raven boohoo on this thread because I said "LOL Ravens suck" his only response was "Says the guy with no flair" leave it to the Ravens to bitch about flair usage. 




 I'm also impressed that 4 people other than you don't hate Baltimore. That's a negative Karma score that truly, truly impresses me. 

*EDIT: Since the posting of this, people have upvoted my original from -4 to 0* 




 No. Thats why I hate it.
 




 I'm a Browns fan. Cant wait to see your throwback jerseys, son. 




 The one that really grinds my gears is when I hear a Steeler say "Here we go Steelers Here We Go!"
 




 Lol. Ravens suck.  




 Well, now it's roached.

 Does a DUI count toward substance abuse? It's a substance based breaking of a law, but it wasnt him failing a drug related NFL rule. I'm still confused on that.

 "Conner Shaw-nuff you right he had a 151 passer rating" I'm still working on it.
 




 I agree with you. I also have been a big fan of him as a pickup since the Draft. My prediction was that Hoyer would get bumped out for Manzeil, then around game 8 I see him getting creamed on a scramble, and then they bring in Shaw and he lights it up not only that game, but for the rest of the,  year. He starts in Johnny comes back at the beginning of '15, plays 2 games, they bring Shaw back, he takes us to the Super Bowl. 
 




 
That's fair: Now I downloaded it to my computer and it froze my whole system up after the 2 hour download and made a weird little window that wouldn't go away, or even let me open my Task Manager, sooooooo now it's confirmed on my box to be a bunch of crap, and a large site doesn't denote a safe site. Gratzi.
 




 I don't know about on your computer,  but on the mobile it takes you to what looks like a phishing page.  Went to real Google Play and downloaded the actual app it asks you to get? Yeah,  doesn't work to open the game up. It still takes to to the same "Download this app to proceed" page.  If you have better luck on your desktop/laptop,  let me know.  




 As a matter of fact, there is even a bar on the SIM. If its connected to the Browns Reddit, we might even be able to get players to make avatars and come talk. They do that with musicians all the time. Trent Reznor will come on play a live show and have his computer set up in the room and it live relays his performance. We could use FRAPS and record the interviews and throw it onto youtube and feature it here. It would be cool to have the first Second Life Browns Backers group. *spelling* 




 So,  Second Life is considered its own country. It has its own currency that is traded on the stock exchange (The Linden Dollar '$L') and it's public, free, and online. Not only that, but I have access to an entire parcel of land that would be all about us meeting there. Just a thought  




  the NFL is a SFW hobby

Yeah.  What with all those role models getting shot, beating their significant others unconscious, battling drug addiction, and murdering folks. 

 




 The OP shames herself by posting naked pictures on an open forum,  and it's not my intention to shame her regardless.  

Uhhhh, That's shaming. You just said she is a shame unto herself,  and then you said it wasn't your intention to shame.  For shame. I'm a left wing hippy (gun toting). I am disappointed.

 Well, she IS a Steelers fan...and are you saying he was acting like a "LaBeau"? Huh? Huh? Amiright?  




 Im also wearing an all orange shirt today, and she had on her Steelers jacket. 




 I walked into the bank today, I live in Seattle, and there is this blonde girl that works behind the counter who is a Steelers fan. The very first time that I saw her I joked "Aren't you say Seattlite? Why the Steelers gear?" She looked at me and said 

"I don't give a f*** I like the Steelers they are a good team they win I don't care about the Seahawks I mean I'm a fan I guess but I'm a Steelers fan first."

 After that she wouldn't look at me or wait on me at all so I just went in there today and had to put in a deposit and she was the only one there. I walked up and I said "I'm sorry I give you crap about being a Steelers fan." And she said

 "I don't give a s*** you're just mad cuz we have six and you have one!"

 To which I realized she thought i was a Seahawk fan, so I replied "I'm a Browns fan." Her demeanor instantly changed; a big smile crossed her face and she said 

"oh, well you got 0." 

And I said "yep we've got 0 but I guess we can at least hate the Ravens together"

 and she said "f*** the Ravens" 

and I said "f*** the Ravens" 

and she said "and the Browns" 

I said "hey f*** the Steelers" 

and we both laughed and we said "f*** Cincinnati" 

and then now we're friends and she smiled as I walked out the door. And that is what it means to have the best rivalry in all of the NFL. And I got to cuss in the bank.

 There is a bus that had a water gun attached to it,  and they soak the new people and they walk by. My grandfather was like: "Stop. Look at the water. Where do you think it came from?" I looked at the bus and it sprayed this huge stream out.  It was awesome. 




 It would be wrong of me to give it away. You should make the pilgrimage sometime!
 




 So you've decided to be a Browns fan? Well, there's a couple things that you need to know to successfully navigate wearing the Orange and Brown. 
 
Number 1: "Don't worry, there's always next year." Now I know what you're thinking: "Why would he be saying there's always next year? We haven't even started this year." This is part of the sacred Tao that is being a Browns fan. It is a mantra that many of us have prayed over, because we know, possibly more than anyone,  that there is no such thing as a sure thing.

Number 2: "We are the hipsters of football fans" I said it. We as Browns fans only support teams that won championships before the institution of the Sellout Bowl. I mean Superbowl. *dons orange and brown flannel shirt, horn rimmed glasses and knit cap*

Number 3: That being said learn who Paul Brown, Jim Brown, Lou Grouza and Otto Graham are.

Number 4: If you're one of the new fans who is going to have the pleasure/privilege/luck of attending home games at FirstEnergy Stadium, be ready to be part of a stadium where you cant have glass bottles! That's right Browns fans like to throw bottles onto the field and the stadium banned their use after one such incident. We are rowdy.  Its fun. 

Number 5: You also can't bring in items from outside, into the stadium. After we could not throw bottles somebody decided to throw batteries.

Number 6: If you get to tailgate before the game in the Muni lot, and you see a large bus. with the ground completely saturated with water in front of it, just keep walking forward and don't contemplate the situation.
 
Number 7: Cornholing is no longer just a sexual slur.

Number 8: F*** the Steelers. (Like for real. We dont like those guys. Ravens[ratbirds] either)

Number 9: Its a Brownie, not an Elf

Number 10: All contributions to televised football aside, we know that Art Modell is actually a multi time failed business man who is the only person to ever bankrupt a football team. 

Number 11: The plain orange helmet is sacred. 

Number 12: Next Year Is Coming. 

I'm sure others may have more to add below, but this is a gift from me, 31 year Browns fan, to you as a bright eyed new dawg ready to get a bark or two out in the pound this year. Welcome. 




 Ummmmm,  no. Aquarian Tabernacle Church marketing guy, yes. (You can check us out @ www.aquatabch.org and our legally recognized seminary at www.WiccanSeminary.EDU The ATC, serving Wiccan needs in 7 speaking nations.) And I hate BP so much I do my best not to use aluminum, because BP controls Lions shares of the aluminum produced in the world. I'm appalled at what they did. My spirituality is one of deep connectedness to the living organism that is our "planet". That being said: I want other opinions so I don't stagnate. And this ish is bugging me,  so I asked y'all. *edited for spelling because my phone is a champ* 




 I had heard that BP was looking to recoup some of what they had to pay out because they believe they over payed. I was wondering what you all thought? 
























 Just making sure the record is straight on who went to who. Good luck on your season.

 And this got downvoted to heck. Case in point. Thanks for the side bar. looks great. Also, That dude on the other thread who deleted all of his posts, yeah, that guy was spouting off about reporting everyone to the Browns mods, and to the reddit mods. Good luck with the rest of your season, all. 




 I think the Green Bay Packers and the Bears might be longer, but ours is far, far, far more brutal and almost as long. 




 And most of the trolling I saw was on the thread that was named "At least I can feel my Browns hate again" which made me think it was a place for some trash talk when I saw what folks were saying. And I went total brat-mode, but I wasnt derogatory.  




 Browns fan here. Totally bantering, but as a rule I try not to ever vote on other teams lists, and I havent thrown a slur, but some really aggro people from this list go to instantly accusing folks of "Vote Brigading" (which is a cool term I had never heard before) even though some of us follow reddiquette. Not saying I havent voted, just that I vote consciously and not to just punish a post, and I reiterate: I try to follow a rule of not voting on other subs. But are we really telling on each other and getting in a twist? We are telling the REDDIT MODS? Really? We are supposed to be like Goku and Vegita. (We're Goku) and we love to hate each other, and we take our lumps from each other, and we do it with pride and honor. *EDIT I can hate you, but I actually tell other teams fans when they get shitty about you guys, that they need to shut their mouths, because they dont know you well enough to hate you like that.* Come on. Brothers who kick the shit out of each other, but going to mom and tattling? We're better than that. Let's handle things in house and just duke it out when need be. Buck up. You've done this 18 of the last 20 times. That being said: Why isnt the sidebar changed for our bet? *Edit: And I upvoted this thread* 




 I just tried it out with some of the Pork I am cooking, and it got done in around an hour and a half at 350. Redux was chardonnay. Mirepoix was carrot, garlic, and mushroom (onion allergy coming to the event and didnt have celery) and then did a Bouquet Garni of thyme rosemary and sage. It turned out amazing.

 Check out the thread entitled "At least I can feel my Browns hate flowing again" Very funny, and somewhat heart warming to have a rivalry REALLY happening over there.

 Because folks say he seems like Brady in the way he dissects a defense, but he is the polar opposite of Brady in that he connects with a SHIT TON of long passes. imo 




 Dont you guys have a sidebar bet to deal with? I think our Mods have probably figured out what they want. Good game, y'all! Welcome back to the rivalry.

 Oh my god and goddess this is amazing. 




 He's on my team and my name needs to reflect his awesomeness. Totally scabber ChristianMingoDOTcom, but I run Hoyer every week, and I never run the CLE Defense. Suggestions? 




 I think Williams just got hurt stopping Brown. 




 This. ^^ 




 *Sips his iced vanilla soy latte with no whip* There just isnt enough of a sample size to truly say that Brian Hoyer isn't a fluke. He just doesn't have the arm strength to be anything but a game manager. *burns his lip and spills his latte on his lap*

 Nice try, Leon. 




 The kitchen has a full steam pan serving area, and my plan is to have it come out right at 20 minutes before doors open for dinner. 




 I like this idea. I am guessing Braising is going to be the way to go. It will be my first venture into braising, which explains why I didn't know how to do this without help. I like this idea. I have to keep it soy free and gluten free, so it will be a corn starch or arrowroot thickener. Wine might be a good idea. It was going to be Rosemary for one, and Thyme Parsley for the other meal and then all three for the third meal. (Keeping it as simple as possible for on site cooking) 




 The beef is top round, and the pork is whole leg. I have access to steam tables. I want to get it done as close to serving time as possible. And thank you for y'alls time. *edit spelling and thank you* 




 We are doing a harvest festival and I am in charge of the kitchen. Instead of cutting the meat small, I have cut the meat in large, rustic chunks of about 2-2 1/2 inches cubed. I want to serve 4 or 5 on the plate with the meal. My question is: What is the besy way to cook the meat? Roasting? Stewing? Pan cooking(which sounds very time consuming)? Or what? Im not sure. I have 3 meals to make like this, so I have to do this three times. I am a really good cook, so I can do just about anything needed, I just dont know what is the best way to do this. Please help. (Oh, there is a full industrial kitchen on site. No broiler available)

 I hate the Steelers. I REALLY dislike Bradshaw. This hurts my heart every time I see it. I wonder if Bradshaw would be less looney if this play hadnt happened?

 This much of the season is equal to the 40 game mark in baseball. It's when you start looking at the identity of a team. Also we are on the other side of our Bye. I thought maybe somebody had put something together.

 I have Rogers. Hoyer and Rogers should be fine  




 The Destroyer is holding strong over his mentor this season in Fantasy. I have Hoyer AND Brady on my team. So I was trying to figure out if I should go with Hoyer as the beast he is, or Brady as the beast he is supposed to be but hasnt been at all this year? So I asked [The Guru] (http://imgur.com/VbOlabc). Das Guru doesnt even have Hoyer ranked (BS) and he has 6 fantasy points on average more than Brady on the year. And their suggestion is Brady over Hoyer. The lack of a ranking is mind blowing to me.

 I think its a bad look for the Browns,  who historically fielded some of the first non white players in football history,  to be dropping racial slurs. It makes you look ignorant. Better to keep your mouth shut and be thought a fool, than to open it and remove all doubt.  I want you to say the word "Jiggaboo" in front of Jim Brown,  and see if he wouldn't just cold cock you.  *edit: players* 




 You just called people jiggaboos....that is some racist hate speech,  sir.  




 [Boo.](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/BooThisMan.gif) 




 It was a nice gesture because he is a Raven, and if you dont get that, you dont get your history. 




 Seriously, if you are one of the many new Browns fans this year this will give you a lot of what you need to know to be on point. 




 My Grandfather has been a season ticket holder FOREVER.  Muni lot patrons know him as Big Den. We were tailgating before we beat Carolina at home a number of years ago, and he said to me with tears in his eyes:"If Lerner would just come down here and see this. If he could just see how much we support this team, maybe it would help them" This makes me happy for my grandpa like I can't even quantify.  




 Guess so. 




 *EDIT: Cleveland has good fans, thank you. We are not good to the Ravens. Sorry-Not-Sorry* 
We fucking hate the Ravens, we hate their fans, and we hate Art. And didnt give his punk ass a moment of silence when the rest of the league did after his stupid ass croaked. We revel in your legal battles, we love that you have the reputation for being thieves, murderers, drug addicts, and adulterers, and we like it when you have to play without your stars.  (Other teams play that game too, but you guys make it into an "Art" lulz) And it was a serious sign of respect that you should recognize, because in a different time, Pita would have been covered in broken bottles, and D Batteries to put the cherry on top of his injury. Know this, and accept our acknowledgement of showing you respect.  




 Knew this was coming. When you call it "The Cundiff Factor" its time to move on  




 Anyone else feel like they are developing angina? 




 #socrow 




 On another thread: http://i.imgur.com/rrljMZB.jpg you're welcome  




 For real. Good job. 









 Yeah, totally not worried. Just relaying some trivia. I didnt know 6 games is what a player had to play for it to count against their contract. I think he'll stay, too.  




 I know that when I shared that I thought that the Ravens and Art Modell sold their soul to the Devil for 2 Super Bowls and now they were paying the piper I got a lot of flak, [but](http://reactiongifs.com/?p=2370)  




 I found out from a friend today that 6 games is the minimum a player has to play for it to be considered a contract year. 




 Thank you. I just saw that the link broke. Just as well, it was from a Ratbird source. I always keep up on the team we are playing next week. If you want the real 411 on how your team is improving, and where your team scares other teams, read your opponents sources the week before the game. 









 Totally worked that way. Gratzi. 




 Done! You are wise. 




 WTF......? 




 I hope Hoyer saw this.  




 Eeeeeeeee.....I don't like any of them 




 Yeah.  I have Devin Hester on fantasy.  He was sitting at 29.20 when I went to bed.  




 Anyone know where I can get a copyable version of his response?

 Bless "you're" heart. 




 I recognize your statement as true, and reply with: "I know. I'm only talking about the one who might become the NFL Commish" 




 **T** 




 Any hater of the Steelers is a friend of mine, unless they're a ratbird. Sorry T-West. 




 Fuck the Steelers in their fucking face. I hope Cam wipes the floor with them and their stupid, stupid, terrible towel. From the Browns, Go Panthers! 




 Well, She IS part of a cabinet of politicians who have been accused of being war criminals. Whether you like that fact, or not, it's true.  









 That was a great great great post. I love being a Browns fan, right now, who has been a Browns fan forever.  




 *WOOOF WOOOF* 




 Accepted.
 




 Brady threw a 15.45 in my league this week, and Hoyer finished with a solid 20.00 




 I just think thats the classiest thing! "You know, we have a storied history with, and have always stood up for murderers and spousal abusers. In that spirit we would like to dedicate this game to Ray Rice" Even if you support Ray, THAT is not the way to do it. THAT is tactless, imo. 









 We shouldnt have to increase the minimum wage, because it should have gone up in concert with CEO pay all along. Then it wouldn't seem like a financial burden when we have to move the common worker out of poverty wages and into livable wages. 




 Someone was going to. He's good.
 




 So on the field we are nameless,  but in the media,  we have a name. His name was Ifeanyi Momah. His name was Ifeanyi Momah. His name was Ifeanyi Momah.. 




 What's his name? *EDIT, His name is Ifeanyi Momah* 









 Thank you for the correction  




 Okay, [I did.](http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2013/01/10/ray-lewis-baltimore-ravens-atlanta-murder-2000/1566198/) He wasn't acquitted of anything he was found guilty of a lesser charge on a plea bargain *edit added*

It says: *Only Lewis pleaded guilty in relation to the case: for obstruction of justice, a misdemeanor. He originally was charged with two counts of murder but struck a deal with prosecutors in exchange for his testimony against two of his companions that night, Reginald Oakley and Joseph Sweeting.* 




 Ray Lewis killed that fool in Atlanta. He was never found innocent. The charges were dropped in exchange for testimony.

 I [told the Ravens sub](http://www.reddit.com/r/ravens/comments/26mas5/ravens_4th_round_draft_pick_rb_lorenzo_taliaferro/chsepzu) when their people started getting in trouble (specifically this was about Lorenzo Taliaferro) that it was Karma. I even wrote a story, and was downvoted and told I was a stupid Browns Fan, and then I was accused of "Running to my sub for upvotes" (which I was too new to know that was a thing). I am reposting my story here, again, in light of Ray Rice, and the Raven fan-base can Dawg my Bone if they dont like it. The truth stings:

**My Story of The Ravens, Art Model, and the Devil**:*The Ravens were created after Baltimore made a deal with the Devil. So many angry prayers smoldered through the earth into the bowels of the Devils play place. Day and night he was assaulted with the lamentations of the lost souls, pining for their Colts. Finally the Son of Light heard a call that would end his suffering: Art Modell was weak, and was begging for release. So Lucifer, that wily old devil, whispered into the ears of each of the most powerful people in Baltimore and within the Browns, and a deal was struck! That deal included 2 SB, and safety from any lasting harm that may come against any of his players and original staff that took part in the move. In return the Browns would move to Baltimore, and in a seperate trade for his immortal soul Belichick obtained his own deal, but that will be a story for another day. And so it was that a faithful and historic football city the likes of Cleveland was stripped of their team, and Baltimores prayers were answered. But oldschool fans know in their hearts which side answered their prayers that day. It is within each true original Baltimore Colts fan. That seed. That knowledge that it was not a godsend. It came from the other direction. And they know when he came to collect. The Super Bowl in the Super Dome. That light failure was no fluke. That was the Prince of Darkness showing up to watch the final moments of his deal. You won. And so did he. And now that Devils deal Baltimore made has come around to the other side, as all deals eventually do. I have a feeling that you will be seeing much more of this as the balance exherts itself. Safe travels, friends.* *edit:formatting*
 




  I have a feeling that you will be seeing much more of this as the balance exherts itself. Safe travels, friends. 

You hate being right all the time

 




 End of his career, but it was the beginning of his HoF push, which he will probably NEVER see now.  




 In the Browns fan-fic I have going on my head,  Haslam unveiled them with the Elf Ear cuts during a team meeting from under a white blanket. A loud "TA DAAA!" and everyone "ooooooooo"ed. *Slow close up on Brownie smiling  mischievously* Then we cut to the boys in the tunnel with the side view of the helmet. 




 Because I think that shit is nice, and I like it. 




 Have they just added that recessed bit around the hole that looks like [Brownies Ears?](http://imgur.com/D7KBC0b) 
























 "Now that's what I call a sticky situation!" 




 Called it. Hit the Bricks. The whole "Me first" mentality was the opposite of *Playing like a Brown*. He has been consistently negative and he can get glad in the same pants he got mad in.  He can just do it somewhere else. 




 I didn't have a red one, all I could afford was a BIIIIG yellow one. 




 Nice try, *Johnny*. 




 Let's look at someone comparable to Gordon: Megatron. They have this figured out with Megatron:

*"If you were watching ESPN Sport Science last October, you saw what a freak of nature Calvin Johnson actually is. Between his 6'5" height and his 6'10" wingspan, he has an 8'8" standing reach. Add in a 45" vertical jump and you've got a guy that can cover over 4,000 cubic feet, all from a standing position. Add it up: Calvin covers an incredible area, more than an average two-car garage."*

Well Gordon is 3 inches shorter with a 36" jump and a 6'8" wingspan. I would put that somewhere closer to 3500 cubic feet total access to teh ball when thrown to him. He totally will have more chances to catch the ball than the 5'10" receiver corps. 

ALGEBRAIC!

And Hoyer fucking rules. Today included. *Snoogins* 




 What's up with Johnny's scary little hand? 




 For the sake of argument would you say, perhaps, Browns? 




 Either way would be good. 




 Where did you find that picture? 




 I trust Farmer. Dumpeda-bump-bump-buM-bUM-BUM. 




 They have all the Twitter accounts of the teammates, reporters, and coaches that represent the Texans. That's a cool resource, especially for people new to the fan-base. 




 We might start getting to draft for depth and development......*mind blown* 




 Browns fan,  here. O'Brien is 6-2 in weather under 40
*EDIT: O'Brien just had to be different with his name spelling. Fixed* 




 Just ordered me a Haden Jersey. Also got a Cribbs jersey a few weeks ago, and my first jersey was a gift from a friend. A retooled Hillis jersey that my boy stenciled my last name on. He even made the stencil in the exact font of the Browns Font. Where are you buying it from? 




 Brown face mask is cool. Grey uniforms is so ugly.....so, so, ugly.

*EDIT: It's official color designation is "Seal Brown"?*

 




 Please Gods, No. Please dont make our Uni's grey.
 




 I think this is the most likely scenario.  




 Respectfully,  why is it so bad?  




 I'm so glad to read this! I have been saying the same thing for a while. WE are America's Team. There are so many people that don't like the Cowboys that calling them America's Team is completely inaccurate. Everyone in football is happier when the Browns do well.THAT should be the hallmark that garners such a nickname.  




 Boobs for Browns is an r/Browns institution. We should never talk bad about it, and we should promote it during every NFL subreddit members drive from here until forever. 




 Mike Freeman is an asshat. He hasnt been saying any of those things all season. I even got in a fight with him on twitter this summer about how damaging his type of journalism can be to the mentality of a team that is struggling. *rant over* 




 Frakkin' brilliant. Thank you SO MUCH! 




 I used to live in Atlanta. It's like going to the Panthers sub and finding out they are rooting for the Ravens to win.  




 It was a sketch that had a machine that made you smart. Someone goes into it and they reverse it to make the person stupid, and they come out as a Steelers fan. I have looked for 3 years and cant find it. This is the only place I can think that might be able to do so. 




 I was just commenting about how much nicer our header is than the Steelers, Bengals, and Ravens.
 




 Holy shit, I know the redhead kneeling down in front of the dude in the purple shirt. I went to Highschool with her. I bet she knocks the fire out of people. 




 Yeah. I have always considered the Bengals to be like playing our brothers. Sometimes we hate each other, and sometimes we have mad respect, but at the end of the day I never throw your name in when I say Fuck the Steelers and Fuck the Ravens. One more time to go, boys!
 




 1st place at game 10?!??!?!?! **WE DEY!!** 




 **MOTHERFUCKING N**
 




 Wow. Browns are in there a bunch.  









 If you have a Hoyerection lasting more than 4 games, please enjoy it.
 




 The completion to Hawkins that he made as he was getting destroyed by the Bucs D? That was outstanding.  




 That puts his total to 4 on the year in 8 appearances.
 




 Lou Groza and Phil Dawson. The Toe, and The Other Toe. He is the second highest scorer in CLE history. The Automatic. *EDIT: Content*

 Today at 6pm Pacific Time, Pierre Claveloux Pete Pathfinder Davis was taken across the veil. He was surrounded by loved ones, and went peacefully in his bed. Today, on our most holy day, when the barrier between the Worlds was at its thinnest, and on the 35th anniversary of the founding of his lifes work, The Aquarian Tabernacle Church; our Grandmother Hekate, Patron Goddess of our Order came across and brought home with her one of her most devoted sons. Founder of the Aquarian Tabernacle Church, Panegyria Magazine, Spiral Scouts, The Pagan Information Network, and Woolston-Steen Theological Seminary, Petes contribution to Wicca, and Pagan rights can never be overstated. From prison ministries, to Veterans rights, and his ability to standardize our faith through the Government, Petes legacy, and the freedoms enjoyed from his actions will be felt throughout the duration of Wicca on Earth.

Pete Pathfinder: Born on Ostara, 1937. Crossed into the Summerlands on Samhain, 2014.

Please hold your phone calls until Nov. 2nd and give the family and church time to grieve. If you would like to post your condolences for the time being, please go to: [The ATC Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/ATCIntl)  




 At least someone really gets what it means to have to rely on Brandon Weedon. 




 I agree with "/u/tits" in the messages. 




 CC all day. Was totally safe. 




 Sorry! I used [Top Seller Jersey](http://www.aliexpress.com/store/1066076)

 I totally wear an XXL. I have a 38in waist, and really broad shoulders,  and weigh in at 225lbs. Mine fits really well.  Not too big,  not too small. Goldilocks.

 I upset some folks by posting something from my twitter account earlier, about Joe Haden being my favorite #23 over Lebron. (which made some people get really upset. said it messed with the integrity of the sub to post from personal twitter accounts) Then they assured me the downvoting would end when I removed the post (which is a little like a reddit gestapo) that it was only because of the twitter association. So now I post this, and the downvoting continues. Browns fans use the down vote as a punishment, as well as an opinion. *shrug* It's okay. I'm stoked for my new jersey and I love the Browns :) *EDIT: As proven by the the post below about not wanting knock off jersey posts, even though every other post about people getting Browns gear at a good deal has been uproaringly upvoted*
 




 Growing up in Kent, all the crime that came into town was from Akron. Yes, its a depressed and yucky place. I have lived in Atlanta (which is far more dangerous) and Seattle (way higher homeless population) and I do have a bruised opinion of Akron. It does not sway my opinion about LeBron, but this article on this Family Foundation is. 




 No, I do know what I'm talking about. "His mere presence is estimated to be worth $500 million a year" That's not for schools. That's private sector earnings. Some taxes might make it to the schools, but that's not the same.  I did find something about the Lebron Family Foundation that I will read up on. Thank you for making me dig deeper. I dont want to dislike him. I just havent seen anything that makes me feel differently. Maybe this will.
 




 It's not his fault that they had them. He was 15. It's the responsibility of us all to make it easier for those coming up behind us. You say he does a ton for Akron. Tell me so I can change my opinion.  




 Everything is awesome. It is a little old, and there is some yellowing on the edges of the lettering, but it's a 2012. Every other thing about it is great. My only complaint is that Washington has some rule about not letting money be put into escrow when ordering from overseas, and so I had to get it mailed to Georgia, and then have them send it to me in WA. Totally buying a Haden jersey next. 









 Shitlord. Nice.
 




 Your entitlement about policing the websites allowed to be x/posted from is killing me. 




 We should downvote the content, not the site. People use the downvote in this sub as a weapon. We just got in trouble for going to other subs and using the downvote as a weapon. So, I wont post any more from my twitter. I also wont agree with the outlook. 




 I'm not stunned.  




 It was all local media reports. St Vincent was not the school he was in district for. He got a scholarship to attend. And the school he was supposed to attend had an expose done on them where they found they were still using text books from the 50's and they showed these holes in the ceilings of the class rooms with black mold in them. Akron is a cesspool. I can understand him wanting to never help out the scummiest town I have ever been in, I just think it's wrong of him. He's part of that scum, even if he did float to the top. Kent for Life. *EDIT: Sorry I dont remember the exact reports from 15 years ago.* 




 Really? Because every post about Hoyers lack of skill reads JUST LIKE THAT to me. So weird.  




 I repeat from my "twitter post": There is no rule about posting from your twitter, facebook, tumblr, or anything else. Our rule is "A community for Cleveland Browns Fans" I think the downvoting because of it being from twitter is ridiculous. The voting isnt a popularity marker, it's supposed to be about content. If you dont like me telling LeBrown, on a Browns reddit, that I like Haden more than him, then downvote the hell out of me. If you dont like that I linked it from a website that you dont approve of, then downvoting is just shamevoting and should be against our rules of good conduct.  




 I never link to my twitter. Maybe twice in the history of being on reddit. I use twitter to talk to famous people who have twitter, because I can link my post right into their feed. I wanted to show that I had told both LeBron and Haden my feelings. There is no rule about posting from your twitter, facebook, tumblr, or anything else. Our rule is "A community for Cleveland Browns Fans" I think the downvoting because of it being from twitter is ridiculous. The voting isnt a popularity marker, it's supposed to be about content. If you dont like me telling LeBrown, on a Browns reddit, that I like Haden more than him, then downvote the hell out of me. If you dont like that I linked it from a website that you dont approve of, then downvoting is just shamevoting and should be against our rules of good conduct. 




 If that's how you want to hear what I said, then bully on you. 
 




 Also that /u/rsipp512 would rather hear about all the topics we cover day in and day out, than to hear anything new or an opinion that might be from a fans personal media. Unless it's his perspective, and his media, I'm sure. Himz an enforcer. So I am complying and posting the same thing. Just like everyone else all over the web. Hoyer v Manziel conjecture. 24/7
 




 This is the problem. Browns fans refusing to hear what is right in front of them. Obviously we need way more posts about this to help you understand. 




 I disliked him before he went pro. I am from Kent, OH. I watched LeBron grow up on my local television networks. I constantly heard the reports about him getting Escalades paid for by the school he was being scholarshipped into, while the school he left was using books from the 1950's and kids were being removed with black mold sickness. I've never heard article one about him putting his money back into those school districts. Maybe if he used his money to help the people that he left behind, then I would have a change of heart. Coming back to CLE and promising a championship is like going to the sun and promising cotton candy. It's no given that it is going to happen. He stepped all over the people that manicured him and removed him from poverty, and now he is back, and It's all chill? I just need more from him. I need him to use his leg up to create a new standard for the kids coming from the same place he did. If he has done that, and I missed it, (I do live in Washington now) I am all about changing my tune. I just think he's kind of a selfish brat. 




 This is a reddit for all things Browns. My opinion about Haden falls under that category. I'll try to post about Hoyer conjecture in the future to keep things normal. 




 Lol. 




 I do not like LeBron. Hadens the only 23 for me. 




 Yeah! Downvotes for Joe Haden!  




 A typical overdose from cocaine: There is a membrane between your nasal cavity and your brain. This bit of flesh keeps your brain fluids in your head. Eventually,  its different for everybody, cocaine will eat through that lining, all the goo from your brain will fall out of your nose, and you'll die. You know in the movies where someone does a line and their nose starts bleeding uncontrollably and they die? That's pretty close. 




 Haden. Nice. upvote for you, sir. 




 You, **FIEND!!!!** *NOOOOOOOOoooooooooooOOOoooo!!!!* I'm upvoting you on principal.  




 I have called "Moving the Chains" on SiriusXM and told them this idea. They pretty much blew me off, but I still think that it's a good idea. I think bringing in as many of the old Browns players that want to mentor and work with the team as possible is a goodt idea. I realize some people cant teach, or coach, and that it is a totally different skill set than being a player. I also think it will bring the energy of "Play Life a Brown" further into fruition when these young players begin finding some new favorite players in the Browns of Old. Wanting to prove yourself in front of people you respect is a great motivator. *EDIT: And Thank You* 




 I dont know about your downvotes. I do know that it's equally important to consider WHEN you say something, as WHY you say something. That being said, McCoy  Weeden. You are correct. Upvote for you. 




 Considering two of those TD's involved GREAT hands, I'm glad to know all of our receivers are that clutch. 




 I would be all over Cribbs as an Assistant Special Teams Coach 




 I can get behind that, mostly.  I don't see him as a game manager, *EDIT: I think he's an outright good QB*,  but I think a sample size of a whole season will tell us a lot.  




 At what point does it become a well educated following? 




 Yes. This. This rings with all the truth. I feel like a grok it now. Thank you. *EDIT: Gold for you, sir. This has plagued me for too long* 




 I understand it has something to do with the long rebuild of the Browns, but where did it start and what are the details around it. I want to understand. 




 McCoy  Weeden 




 McCoy is SO MUCH better than Weeden. 




 *"The Cleveland Browns beat the lowly Oakland Raiders to move to 4-3, which in itself is a massive accomplishment.*

*That's not meant to crap on the Browns, but the coaching staff in Cleveland is doing an amazing job coaching up the talent on the roster. Brian Hoyer at quarterback, no Alex Mack, a rotating backfield, no Josh Gordon and yet they're competitive in a loaded AFC North. Let's get Mike Pettine and Kyle Shanahan on some Coach/Assistant Coach of the Year ballots.*

*The rest of the season won't be easy, given the schedule and talent issues, but I'm past betting against this team. ***The Browns are one of the NFL's grittiest teams***, and winning ugly, cold, muddy football games in November and December seems very realistic."* 









 Nice try, Johnny. 




 **A** 




 Im not acting like you hurt my feelings. Im pointing out that you are agressive. I reallynliked Colt McCoy, and if you looked at my messages from the game the other night, my friend was keeping me up to date on the game, because hes one of my favorite Browns QBs. No need to be grumpy. 




 I never minimized his health. Your anger is pushing you to make assumptions. I said his dad was the nail in the coffin. You are arguing that Colts injury is what made us cut him, and THAT seems highly unlikely that a concussion will cause a team to let you go. A raging parent that you wouldn't have to deal with had the person not been on your team? That makes sense. Oh, and [this from 2012.](http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2012/05/03/report-brad-mccoys-comments-sealed-colts-fate-in-cleveland/) Blessings on you and Go Browns! 




 I'm sorry. It seems like you dont want to have a civil discussion. I am sorry that this is how people have treated you, and that you feel that it is okay to be so aggressive when you perceive that people are wrong. Is this how they treated you when you made a mistake as a child? I can imagine. Parents and adults can be really cruel. Lots of people have played through a concussion, and plenty of peoples parents havent come into the locker room like it was a Texas High School and yelled at the coaches. We have lawyers for that sort of thing in the pros. Again, I'm sorry for your need to be so mean, and Go Browns! 




 I saw him get knocked out, and then his dad came in and yelled at the staff about taking care of his boy, and then Colt stayed Benched, and then we traded him. I am all about learning more if there is more. 




 Awesome. I'm not wholly sold on the debunking, but I'm not wholly sold on the validation of existence, either. I havent had a chance to study about it because, obviously, I had the wrong name. Thank you! 




 She has food allergies and the kitchen has never taken them into consideration like I did, before. For 20 years she spent hundreds of dollars for a weekend and couldnt eat the food she had paid for. 




 Blew my mind. 




 I think Colt McCoy's daddy ruined his career in Cleveland. 




 OH! I see what you mean. I said I braised them with salt and pepper. Yes, I SEARED them with salt and pepper, then mirapoix, then braised them in Wine and Apple Juice. Thank you for pointing that out to me.
 




 I was instructed to sear it in the pan, make a maripoix, and then re-add the meat and fill just about halfway up with liquid (wine and apple juice for this one), and then bake. Sorry if I was unclear! 




 On the entire weekend, for 120 people, I spent right around $2k, which was $2.5k less than the previous year.  




 RODS!! Yes. Thank you. 
 




 Everyone can celebrate with me! We had a blast and it was in part because of this wonderful sub! Thank you all, and Karma for all the wonderful encouragement!
 




 Okay, First off I will disappoint everyone, but hopefully I will make up for it with the story. I didn't get pictures. I was so busy this weekend that I got 10 hours of sleep from Thursday to Sunday, and 5 of them came from Saturday to Sunday. I have [this picture](http://imgur.com/8GIvVbZ) that I took. It shows the concept, but I tried to upload it before the event, and my phone wouldn't let me. My menu was really simple. I'll tell you the entire production for the final nights feast. 

We had what I named Harvest Feast Pork (not very original, but it went with the theme)  I took my trimmed, 2-3 inch cubed pieces of pork leg, and braised them with salt an pepper. Then I added used olive oil, and garlic instead of onion in my mirapoix (so celery, carrot, and garlic). To deglaze I used white wine (chardonnay) and apple juice. I then added a rosemary/parsley bouquet garni. I put it in at 350 for 4 hours. When the meat came out, I used corn starch as a thickener.  Earlier in the day, my morning crew had peeled, cored, and sliced into quarters, 5 bags of apples and pears. I then panned them, covered them in cinnamon, and made a slurry of apple juice, water, cinnamon, and sugar. I poured that over the top and set to cook it for 2 1/2 hours at 350. I also learned how to use convection ovens this weekend (that was cool) and I made near to 90 squash that we served in quarters. I had also made a "Hobbit Stew" earlier and put up in the freezer for the feast. It was a homemade Veggie stock (carrots, celery, leek, garlic, ginger, rosemary, thyme, parsley) and then I used it as the base for turnips, parsnips, rutabagas, yellow/purple/red potatoes, sweet potatoes, purple yams, and Asian yams which I served a ladle of to everyone. Then corn on the cob cooked in water with a little sugar and apple juice, as well as pretzel rolls were the sides. It was an amazing feast. We had pumpkin pie (store bought) to accompany everything and southern style sweet tea to beat the band. 

We had 2 other dinners that were made in the same exact way except they were beef, and the bouquet garni was rosemary, and then thyme on the second one.  It was wonderful and I could never have done it without you. I will scour the pictures coming out from the event and see if anyone took pictures of their food. Since that is all instagram seems to be used for, I am hoping it is inevitable that I can find some. Thank you again and I am a life long follower of /r/cooking from here on out!

 




 Yeah. My main goal is to find the video. 




 So you have the video?  




 Thank you for  all your help with my dilema. (huge chunks of meat needing to be cooked for many people) Someone literally cried because they had never had such good food in the 20 years they had been attending the event. Thank you /r/cooking, you rock. 




 They were called "Tubes" in the video, and they were caught on a Nat Geo documentary (I think) about base jumping into a giant hole in a jungle somewhere. They were caught on the video, but were unseen by the divers. Anyone? 




 I'm an everyday, off the internet witch, who does very little in the actual pagan community. I'm just out of my element, here. Sorry guys.  




 I just called to get Cable set up in my business, and the lady I talked to was a in Cleveland, so I of course said "Go Browns!" and she said "Hell yeah 'Go Browns'!". After an hour long call that was 40 minutes of Browns fandom, she gave me an extra 10$ off my package! "You're a Browns fan, so I'm going to do what I can to help you out". The world she is a-changin'. :) 




 Most pit bull breeds are smaller than a golden retriever.  None are big enough to be what you're describing.  




 AND you called me a twat. What is that? LOL. We call folks derogatory names in this sub? Or is that just how you roll? Is that how you "engage" folks?
 




 You did exactly that, earlier. You crossed your arms, stuck out your tonge, and told me I had "unmitigated hubris". I'm not talking to the mods, I am talking to the person who doesnt know me who told me to take it to /r/nativeamericanspiritualists when they arent even PAGAN! I'm not gonna drop my d ^k on the table and tell you my lineage or my degrees, but I has 'em, Jack. I'm wondering why you are here? Why are you preying on /r/pagans? Do you have a lot of friends here? You get a lot of upvotes for telling pagans they should shoot, or run over Coyotes that they see?  




 /r/heathen says what? Nah, I'm just kidding, you're a peach. Seriously, though. Why are you here? To tell Pagans they are stupid? I'm totally engaging you now. I'm engaging you on the fact that you are a square hanging out with circles and yelling about our number of degrees. LOL 




 Wait a minute....You're a Heathen?!?!?! LOLOLOL You're whole argument is invalid. I thought some pagan was being a jerk to me and being an antagonist, now I see it's nothing more than a heathen, acting normal. /r/heathen kick you out? You dont understand us. I totally get it now. You are excused for your ignorance, but I do wonder why you're monopolizing /r/pagan? Seriously, did /r/heathens kick you out? Happy Samhain, sir. LOL
 




 You're an antagonist.  




 The fact that I was raised Native American Spiritualist is enough for me. You win, though. This subreddit is not for me. 




 I find your lack of faith and your trash talk arrogant and off-putting. It's a bad look for r/pagans to take a post from someone who is like "I dont know if I'm pagan, but this was the only place I felt safe to share my magical experience" and then tell them not everything is magic, and it's probably a rabid coyote and not anything worth anything. 
 




 I think maybe you meant to be in r/skeptics. This is r/pagan. *EDIT: Also, Everything IS remarkable and significant. Life just rolls like that. MORE EDIT: It's important to live an examined life where you realize that the world creates itself in your image, everyday. I once read a great sentence: "Religion isn't just what you think about things, it's what you do about things, and how you do it". This is what it means to understand your spiritual path, and to understand that the universe is creating itself for you every moment.*
  




 This was the correct place to post. Goddess speaks to us through her messengers. It takes living a deliberate life,  actively believing in the magic around you, to hear the messages of the divine.  Coyote is totally on the payroll and carries a strong message when you cross paths.  




 It plays on the fact that they are part of the Dawg Pound, and it plays on the idea of the "Ground and Pound" in MMA fighting. They just pound the hell out of everyone with their Ground game. And thank you :) 




 The Ground Pound 




 I personally was taught that every time you see an animal in such a manner, that it is deliberate. Maybe you need to focus on someone trying to trick you, or maybe Coyote is telling you to learn how to take a joke, or to be aware of your surroundings? It could also be telling you that you need to sing with those that are of your same kind. It DID lead you here. Just sayin'.  
























 Dude, Johnny gets SOME blame. The idea that he doesn't is silly. 




 It was,  but I was moving to Atlanta,  and missed the whole thing.   




 Bad form. Go Browns. 




 This year looked rough on paper, and then playoff calibre teams' seasons tanked and we beat 'em. 




 Yeah, historically he sucks against the Bengals. 




 [Can't tell if I am being down voted by Hoyer fans for saying I am sure Manziel will get better, or if I am being down voted by Manziel  fans for saying he threw interceptions...]( http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/131/399/fry.PNG?1307468855) 




 The people who are calling this season a "Sinking Ship" and that we "screwed up all season by not playing Manzeil" should read this. This has been the most exciting season of football since 95, for me. We have made some great steps forward, and we get to finish off the season letting Johnny get ready for next year. I dont hate it. No more controversy. Go Browns. *edit: I spell like a Steelers fan* 




 Only a Browns fan calls 7-6 after 14 years of 5 or less wins, a sinking ship. I'm not calling for a QB change, but I am hoping that we can keep in perspective how much better we are, and let that be a building block we are proud of. Todays game sucked. Now to next week. 




 Sorry. I was downvoted to hell and told this is how we think on this sub, so I am just holding the line that the fanbase set down. It's our fault, not the refs, sorry. Go Browns. 




 He did throw 3 (2 were upheld) Interceptions. *shrug* I'm sure he'll get better.
 




 Did you think this fanbase, with the way it treated a 7-5 QB after only one other winning season in 15 years, would give Johnny a break? 
 




 I agree with this. It would have been nice to get the same for Hoyer. I am all in with whoever we pick, I just think the infighting over the QB makes me yearn for Connor Shaw.
 




 To quote what was said by /u/slapdog238 : "As a Browns fan who has lived all over the country, I can assure you, every. single. fanbase. thinks the very same thing. It's a copout. Our team is simply not playing well." Though I agree with you. Go Browns 




 To quote what was said by /u/slapdog238 : "As a Browns fan who has lived all over the country, I can assure you, every. single. fanbase. thinks the very same thing. It's a copout. Our team is simply not playing well." 




 Do I look like I'm jumpin' nimbly pimbly from tree to tree? 




 TEAM NFL. I dont even think thats an NFL company anymore.
 




 Because the signature of a ghost is more easily imprinted magnetically onto film?  




 I lurk here pretty hard. This is awesome footage.  




 [As a Ravens fan, you're technically a Browns fan, anyway.]( http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130303064521/glee/images/6/6b/Tumblr_m69gmgBqVj1rskeexo1_500.gif) 




 They are probably the crown jewel of my Browns collection. Good looking out! 




 Inherited them from my uncle. He's only 13 months my senior, and his dad (my Papa) is a long time season ticket holder, and his buddy used to be the equipment manager through '95 and the Ravens kept him on. But that's a long story for a pair of shoes. I'm just lucky as hell to have 'em. Thanks again. Go Browns. 




 Rocking out the vintage TEAM NFL kicks, and my Battle of Ohio towel from the 2012 home game with no advertisers marks on it,  and to celebrate wearing the vintage kicks; My new Haden jersey. Go Browns! 









 I say this with all sincerity. I want to be excited. I have been so disillusioned by the Hoyer Hate Vs Manzeil Hate on the sub that I am having a really hard time being getting there. I'm Brown and Orange till I die. Heres to getting excited, and a unified fan base. Go Browns. 




 Does anyone know where they are dumping the raw files? 




 Very true. 




 Indeed. I've always liked old school Seahawks fans.  




 I'm a big fan of Hoyer's. I know better than to buy a Cleveland QB jersey. 




 [Top Jerseys Seller]( http://www.aliexpress.com/store/1066076) 




 Yes 




 A little tight, but I suggest if your player was on the team in 2012, look for one of those. They rock and are super comfortable. 




 It got to me in 3 weeks, my child. Though I had to ship it to GA, then have it shipped to me in WA, because of some thing about keeping the payment in escrow while it processes. You might get it in 13 days. I have had quick turnaround on both of my orders. Blessings on your Secondary from my new favorite nickname: Interception Jesus. 




 Also, owning a Reebok jersey and  Nike jersey, I can officially say the Nike ones are not as stylish. 









 This is why The Haden Jersey is in the mail.  




 Thanks for the consideration, this was a powerful evening for me and I thank anyone who gives this picture a shot, in advance. 









 Totally understandable!  




 I am LBQT, so if I could please post this picture, that would be perfect.
 




 I knew it was Lil John when I read the headline "Fox sends little person to Cincinnati press conference" Epic. I would sport that flair all day. 




 Love me some Little John! 









 Totes fake. I was about to say: "I hope Hoyer knocked Johnny the fuck out" because this crap would be the ugliest, least mature move, ever. I'd stop watching the season if my man acted like that. 




 I'll upvote once for ya, Professor. 




 All I'm saying is: I get it. He pawned a ring. Now let's move on and get back to the rest of the library of songs by Sublime. All of which are amazing. It breaks my heart that there is a song that I dont like.
 




 So, 'Yes'. It's okay. You'll chill, and gel, eventually. 




 Pawn Shop by Sublime  




 New Browns fan? 




 Go Browns 




 Pettine's awesome. 




 He's usually clutch. If the only time he hit the field was a clutch situation, then the odds are in his favor of being really good, plus, (and I am officially excited to see him play) Johnny's GONNA get hurt with his style. It's not 'if', but 'when'. He was lucky to not have gotten hurt on that TD scramble. He took a crazy hit to the side during the play. Plus we know that Hoyer is better than any backup or starter since we got back in '99, so he's a safe bet. If he can't get a starting job somewhere, I hope we sign him as a backup. 




 He had a good run. I hope we keep him as a backup QB. Heeeeeeeeeerrrrrrreeeeeee's Johnny. Cundiff should retire to Baltimore. 




 This is actually full of truths.
 




 They should change that jumbotron THIRD DOWN graphic to any other color combination than the current Yellow and Black. 




 Yeah, or when the Big Brown D gets pentatration to stuff the tight end. Big fan. 




 I say we bring in Manziel to kick. He has college experience.  




 That honor is reserved for that slack ass Raven in a Browns uniform. I swear to Christ that Baltimore is paying him to miss kicks, on the side. 




 /r/skinwalkers 




 Wow...this is trash. 




 
I think this is the closest to what will actually happen. 




 I've been pretty much addicted since I found it. [Nice to meet you.](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/hi.gif)  




 Ahhhh, snarky insults. A rarity on reddit. It's possible that this is a couple months old. I searched the sub before I posted it because I work a lot and dont always stay abreast of my string and two cans. I'll just go back to reading the posts on this sub. Thank you. 




 I was not hip on the all nude spreads, penetration, or more hardcore posts. I respect and hold (somewhat) your opinion. I dont want people to make a job out of filling our sub with woman-flesh. I can-not, however, as a warm blooded North-East Ohio sports fan, turn down a girl when she has Cleveland Browns Pasties on and tells me she is proud of us beating the Falcons, and would I like to reward the sub with her ample chest? I'm probably going to take that picture and post it every time. Not because it's pornographic, but because we all earned it, and deserve to bask in the gifts given to us by our supporters. You will PROBABLY not see any more pics from me on the subject, but I also cant promise that another girl from my church isnt going to be like "Hey! you beat the Colts! Lemme take a boob picture in a cowboy hat for your sub!" I wouldnt have the heart to not take and share the unique bounty that being a winning Browns Fan on this sub generates. I'm sorry if you are offended. And I'm not annoyed by your opinions. I'm simply down hearted by the energy that has swept over this sub, recently. People attacking other subs, attacking our own members, and a general air of "We are a serious ball club sans shenanigans" has me a little down, but your opinions are sacred, because they are your opinions. Go Browns 




 This is akin to saying "I like presents,  but save all your gift giving until Christmas. Don't give any gifts until it's seasonally appropriate." But that's just my opinion.  I can look at harlots on the Web all day,  but bare breasted Browns fans only exist in certain places,  and I want to see them whenever our female fans are ready. 




 They aren't mine. I only captured them on film. I agree with people not asking for boob pics, but if a female Browns fan can't take a picture of her ample bosom in celebration of a win, then I dont know how we can call this THE Browns subreddit. If people were hounding folks for pictures, I could understand, but freely given Brownie Boobies being down voted when it's part of our history, dare I say, part of the very lifeblood of our membership; like beer and bad memes and down voting to punish people that are different. It's part of us. Dont hate. Participate. 




 These were the same boobs that can be found [in this pink bra](http://i.imgur.com/DUd72BT.jpg) These were a gift for beating the Falcons last week. Go Browns! 









 Just posting the news coming through the wire. It's not my job to prove or disprove, only to populate the sub with conspiracies, and that being said, yes, more evidence. 









  Tim Tebow won a playoff game for the Broncos. Does that mean they shouldn't have replaced him with Peyton Manning?

And as of right now, the only thing comparable between Manzeil and Manning are that they both start with M-A-N. 




 Yeah, splitting the energy of the fanbase isnt my favorite idea. I would rather have the conversations here. I'm all in on Hoyer, and I wouldnt want to spend all my time with people who just wanted to talk about him. *This in no way is an endorsement for either QB. We Bark Together* 




 [Do The Money With Me!](http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/wic.gif) 




 I was really happy to see this happen when it did. 5 ints and no tds over two games is the right time to put someone on the bench and make them  watch their replacement. He did better than I thought in certain cases, and worse than I thought he would be in others. Good stuff from him though, and I'm glad he got his start. I do not, however, think they will keep him in next week. Just a hunch. We'll see. 




 But you did say this:

 Ahh, the victim complex. Classic!

Which is the same as

 you're too much of a homer to see it.

in that we dont need to trash each other on this sub. We're supposed to be the best fans in the NFL. Let's do that. We dont need to blitz each other when there is so many boobs, beers, and dogs with hats to make us the envy of /r/nfl. It's all irie.  




 Not everything is about you. Jeeeesh!  




  you're too much of a homer to see it.

We dont need to call names. I'm one of the most chill fans out there. I'm just commenting that I saw a lot of busted calls. I DONT usually see or say such things. You generalized me on a single opinion. Again: We're all on the same side, here. 




 And you are being all aggressive, attacking and mean. I'm not the thing you're mad at. I'm on your side in this sub.
 




 He says as I watch illegal block after holding call not get called against the Red White and Blue. 




 He says as I watch Orton Draw the D offside by illegally shaking his head and arms and not being called.
 




 He says as I watch the yellow flags increase to 8 vs 5 for the Bills 




 I just want to know what they have to do to get to wear those black and white stripes. 




 In the KITCHEN!!!! Ishmaa'ily is a MONSTER! 




 When did being a smoker start being called being an "ent"? also, where does "ent" come from? 




 Hendrix, Joplin, and Morrison were all found dead with white lighters in their pockets, and then Jerry Garcia coined that they were bad luck. Also, historically, black and white were the only colors of bic lighter, and you could more easily see the resin from the pipes you smoked with it, making the cops more easily recognize your pot smoking.  




 White lighters are bad luck. Retake with a new lighter.

 




 **E** 




 A flea. 




 They've played 11 and it's 12 weeks in. 




 "The Browns are still the Browns"? That's racist sir. You're racist. 




 Best division in history is the current AFC North. Never have all the teams in a division been 3 games over .500, 13 games in.  




 I don't have that problem and I am subscribed to a bunch of subs 




 I can't upvote this enough. 




 Gotta admit that this doesnt happen to Hoyer, Thomas, Haden, Gipson, Dansby, Whitner, Dray, Pettine, or anyone else on the Browns. 




 Johnny Manziel might not be a trouble maker, but trouble sure finds him. Cant wait till he's the starter and is still doing BS like this. This junk makes him look like a thuggish child. Who let's their crew beat the shit out of folks? Plaxico. Next thing he'll be shooting himself in the leg and wearing sweat pants to night clubs.  




 Most of those mistakes were to Gordon, to be fair. I bet the rhythm is way better next week.
 




 Browns. 




 Going Browns in 3....2.....*holds single finger up quietly and points to you* 




 Nope, people on this sub sometimes use the downvote and a lot of ugly talk as weapons when they dont agree with you. Not just your issue. 




 **O** 




 *Insert lecture on knowing and/or repeating history* 




 I can appreciate that you feel comfortable likening an interception in a football game to the genocide of a people. I'll keep that in mind for next time. Also: "Downvote for likening an interception in a football game to the genocide of a people" 




 Because its Browns History, and its in the current news stream. 




 Thank you for noticing. I have been all over reddits nfl pages, and we totally compete for best put together and aesthetics. *EDIT: [Case in point the Arizona Cardinals Subreddit. Sketchy neighborhood for sure.](http://www.reddit.com/r/ArizonaCardinals/)

 Nice try, Josh. You should just be happy with the reinstatement. Dont try to get free Omaha Steaks from people.  




 I agree. I'm just sharing the news on the wire. 




 As my colleague above stated, as shown to us by the Large Hadron Collider experiments, all signs point to "Go Browns". It was more important than finding the Higgs-Boson. Surprised you didnt read about it.
 









 It's WAY worse than Hoyer, who is in the 70% range.  




 Johnny Jamboogie is the savior of instagram, not Cleveland. That's the Destroyers job. 




 Hoyer-wut? 




 I hope you enjoy that low hanging fruit! Also, his win percentage is 40.6% L33t4shure 




 Ooooo! Now post his win percentage! *This is fun!* 




 Since this is obviously just fan fiction, I burn it, or turn off my computer. Then I go get my free health care checkup. 
























 Johnny is nothing more than the 21st QB since 99. He'll be gone soon 




 I'll do my best. 




 I'll own the hate I perpetrate. 




 Yeah, I was responding to ManChild goop gobbler saying it was posted already. I DO think he needs bad Manziel press shoved down his throat. I did not know it was posted already. 




 I'm from Kent. I love Cribbs so much you'd think it was /u/740Buckeye sucking off ManChild. 









 Not an intentional repost, but the link is broken. 




 I'm sure you are. 




 *Edit I didn't know, but out of everyone* You need to hear it twice. 




 Here's hopin'. 









 Fantasizing about two at once? Johnny acts like he has a small dick , I understand with a gaping wide ass like yours, that you would long for a good fucking from me. Well I'm gonna give it to you. I'm in process. 




 His cock is so far inside of you, I don't think you could disengage with a crowbar. Also, fuck ManChild. I'd rather have Weeded back just to spite you. Quinn 2015! Thigpen for life! 




 GTFO already. Your opinions are fine,  your delivery is bullshit and you have single handedly become the voice of fools on this sub.  




 GTFO 




 STFU and get out of this sub.  




 I wouldn't be surprised at all is your pussy ass can't take the type of bullshit you spew on this sub.  




 Here, I'll give it a try.  F-U-C-K M-A-N-Z-I-E-L A-N-D F-U-C-K Y-O-U Y-O-U M-A-N-Z-I-E-L D-I-C-K S-U-C-K-I-N-G F-A-N-B-O-Y W-H-O-R-E 




 This is the first thing you've said that I didn't have to decipher though a mouth full of ManChild dick and balls. I didn't even know you could talk without them in your mouth . 




 Here you go talking about busting. Im sure he busts on your face every night while you fantasize about him talking you to town from behind. Is it the alcohol content of his spooge that has you addicted?  




 You sure talk about ManChild and sucking ALOT. Freudian much, Gargle Balls McBuckeye? 




 Yeah,  and Manziel has run his crooked little pecker down the mouth of a /u/740Buckeye and the rest of the sub has to smell the cum breath he left you,  because you insist on wagging your cum soaked tongue all over this sub. 




 Welcome to your new life on reddit 




 If by half motivated you are talking about how his cock filled filed you up while he paid you to stick his dick all over this sub, I'd say is half hard motivation got you screaming his name in bed,  and by bed,  I mean this sub. Every post your cock sucker waggles about Manziel fills this sub wroth you Manny cum breath. Floss and pick a new topic.  




 Defending Manziel and gobbling his goop are two different things. You can't defend when your eyes are filled with tears and you have cum seeping out your nose. 




 Read the rest of my posts you baby fucking cock whore of a human being. Context is important. I want anything to happen that fucks you over and gets rid of Manny the jack fuck ass hat. I pray for Shaw to win strictly to prove you wrong.  I also now have a new reddit mission. Good luck.  




 I used to like him. Now I don't. You are the poster child for why I don't. He brings fools in his wake, and it's not good for the culture. This is a team,  he's an island. A loser of an island that can't get off my Browns fast enough. I pray that he does something so inappropriate in the off season that the front office has no choice but to fire him. Shaw takes the helm and  takes us to 3 super bowls. We only win one, but we beat Denver for the AFC title each time.  I also hope it makes you see how horrible he is. I also hope he goes to Oakland.  I also hope you have a dream tonight about having sex with your grandma. Sorry to be so vague about my feelings. 'Nite. 




 I can't wait until he's cut. Strictly because of you /u/740Buckeye. Fuck that guy, because fuck you, and no other reason. You have sucked all over this sub for weeks. Your fan boy outlook is the worst kind of fandom. You HAVE to be a better person in real life than you appear online. To quote John C. Reilly from Guardians of the Galaxy *"I don't believe anyone is 100% a dick, ma'am"*  




 I do, because it shows he really isn't thinking about anything but the moment he is in.  




 Because of what /u/Ihateloops said, below. It's a valid point. 




 He's a Brown. This is a Browns sub. Oh! We are supposed to not talk about him now that he has a negative spotlight  on him for his actions. 




 Today is a fine day to party. The season is over, but it proves he has no couth. 




 LOL. 









 I work at home! Wooooooo! 




 I like "In the style of Watership Down"  




 I am an hour and a half from Seattle.  I am so freaking jazzed. 




 Just moved to Seattle. Very excited.  




 I just moved to Seattle......Yiiiiisssssss. 




 That's the same play,  I think.  




 He looked like he got speared in the sternum. That would have had the ability to mess up his throwing arm.  




 I really think he got hurt on that sack by Houston. It coincides with his oddly drastic decline. 




 Or on his mobile phone.  




 Let's not give Manny a chance to change that. *EDIT: Hoyer has a winning record, boyo. Manny is a 2 time loser.* 




 He hasn't earned the right to not pay attention.  His actions all season have made him a target.  Thomas could live tweet the whole game and no one would bat an eye, because we know he gets it done on Sunday. We don't know that about JFF. All we know is he fucks off and loses games, so when he fucks off,  it makes us remember that he has been losing us games. And cussing beligerance from fan boys wont change that.  




 That's fair. 




 You Are A Ball Of Sunshine. 




 No downvote, but a boo for you, sir. 




 When a team plays like a Brown, they don't have a name. Once they score, they do have a name. His name was Jordan Cameron. 




 Aren't the steelers the bubble blowing babies that ran to the reddit admins (not even the Steelers admin, but the fucking reddit bosses) because of Browns fans going into your scummy ass sub and making these types of posts? You all act the same online as you do after a live game. If you win, you are insufferable, if you lose, you are entitled whiney bitch babies. If you bring this shit to our sub, don't expect us to keep quiet on yours. Treaty broken. 




 I've been on this train since the draft. Never had seen Johnny OR Shaw play. Watched their highlight reels and said "The moment this Shaw kid gets on the field for a team, he is never getting off until he retires. I bet Johnny and Hoyer both get taken out, and Shaw takes us to the Super Bowl" Well, some of that didn't come true, YET. But we will see. This is my "Johnny gets his start". I am PSYCHED! 




 I can't believe I have this many feels for a one year player. He has been so solid. Here's to him getting on as a coach somewhere in the Browns organization! 




 I am so fucking excited. So. Fucking. Excited. I have been a Shaw fan since the Draft and I called him ending the season. I hope he lights it up and wins a spot on the team, permenantly. 




 If her puss was dripping wet, and she ground it into your pants to the point that it made your cock wet, then it is theoretically possible, since it would have been body fluid contact on your genital skin, then yes. You could technically get it. More likely you got something from actually having sex, or a girlfriend cheating and then giving it to you. Either way, get tested. Reddit can't help you, a clinic can. Good luck. 




 That is amazing...... 




 This is the first I have heard of this,  as a fan living in Washington.  




 In sweatpants. 




 I love The Draw Play.  




 ruru22 




 He's my favorite coach we have had since 99, and I was pretty young for the pre-95 Browns, so he is pretty much my favorite coach we have ever had in my lifetime.  




 So, you would say that the single TD of the Season for Manziel wasnt a dangerous "take the hit" sort of drive where he got clobbered in the side? He was lucky that one didnt take him out. I dont think Johnny avoids contact. 
 




 He is going to keep getting beat up and hurt until he is physically unfit to get on the field. RGIII for example. I think Manziel was a panic pick, anyway. He might be worth a LOT in trade bait if we can stop him from getting chewed up and broken. 




 If Hoyer had been hurt and taken out, Manziel would have gotten an earlier shot. As it stands, Manziel is getting the same shot. He got hurt. shot's over till he's better. #ConnorShaw2015 




 Because he isnt fit for the NFL, and what's up with the name calling? Last bastion of a failed defense.  




 More than Johnny has. 




 You heard me. I said reap it. 




 So not Manziel, then? 




 Hoyer has scored more points as a backup in his two games on the bench than Manziel has.  




 You're just part of the very problem that you are railing against.  You might be THE POSTER CHILD for that which you attack in this post. This proves the old adage: *When you point a finger you have 3 pointing back at you* Be the change you wish to see. When you make that change in your self you will see it mirror in your world. We only see the bad in others that we see in ourselves, and you kinda exemplify that with this thread. 




 This is why a winning season is now a losing season
 Annoying because I'm not blinded by the first glimpse of hope. We shouldn't be happy with an "okay" quarterback, because an "okay" quarterback is going to cost us games by doing stupid shit like throwing balls into the chest of a defender and throwing into triple coverage...teams know that Hoyer has accuracy issues, and they load the box and FORCE us to attempt to air it out...
 




 I think you're just getting the same reaction to your Manziel ultra fanboydom that you spewed all over the Hoyer fans. You are part if the crap ass fan base that called for the head of a 7-6 season. You sewed this shit. You reap it.  




 Oh, no you're  not.  You say things like
 I'm not sucking Manziel's dick, I'm just saying that Hoyer has the mobility of a 450lb hamplanet confined to a wheelchair.
also known as a steelers fan



 




 You a Hoyer fan, bro? 









 I am sure that is true. I am sure a good number of the "I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU WOULD NOT SUPPORT JOHNNY?!" folks are also. 




 I think maybe we are missing each other due to each of our definition of "calling for his head". I remember the throngs of folks making fun of others because "You don't draft a QB at 22  and then run a perennial backup" and the throngs of all caps posts about just that subject, we're pretty vitriolic.  




 Miked1be, you are a moderator. You see all of this. You know that people have been calling for Hoyer's head since before the draft. 




 We don't know that. 




 Down voting this isn't fair to you,  but boo  sir. Boo to you. 




 I'm not rooting for either of them,  anymore.  I'm rooting for the Browns as a whole, however that may look. Shaw, Hoyer, Manziel, Mariota, mother fuckin' Jay Cutler, a walk on who I don't know and have never heard of. We aren't a cult of personality, we are a team. So I'm rooting for my team.  




 He is getting the same support IN THIS REDDIT *Edit: While losing* that Hoyer got.  




 Just giving him the same consideration Hoyer got.

 The front office said they will  probably draft a QB every year, and that they will field the people that give us the best chance. I truly think if this office thought Mariota would do the job, they would pull the trigget. 




 I guessed the real question you want answered would be "Why do humans get repulsed at the smell of a rotting corpse?" 




 To attract the things that will eat and dispose of it. 




 Lucas oil additive. It really works.  




 Mariota is Farmers guy. *shrug* 




 Just heard what was going on, today.  The source is what blows my mind. The first I have seen of any of this was in an article about how Uber was over charging people  to get out of Sydney.

 God: My child, I use evolution to create that which I want to come into existence. Time is an operating principle of the universe that even I cannot escape. It takes time and intent to create. When you want to create something, you have to get the tools together and work with the materials to create that which you have imagined. I must do the same. So do not fear it there bones under the grass, or that there are stars above with the promise of other races. I have many pallets, and many tools and I take my time to make everything perfect. Because every creation I make is special, and important. Just like you.

 Germany can take the blame for some of it. Though they can take the blame for the current surge in Polands economy too, so there's that.   




 Well, Poland remembers what happened last time they were told that things would be fine with Russia. 




 I had to see if it was just me. Literally the reason I opened up the comments on here. Why, indeed? 




 Our colors and concept are CLASSIC. Jim Brown referred to our jerseys as "The Yankee Pinstripes of American Football" Most Browns fans know that in our bones, without having to be told it. This is why most Browns fans are scared about the change. *edit spelling*

4: I am a vet of reddit secret santa, but I have not done Drafts for the Draft.

5: After getting really drawn into the craziness of the new Browns energy, I had to find a bigger community. Being a displaced Clevelander is hard. 10 years in ATL, and now I live (hopefully forever) outside of Seattle in the mountains. I am wearing a Browns shirt and orange shorts in San Fran in China Town as we speak.



 




 When his heart is true, all luck's his. 




 I was recently having a conversation with a friend of mine about this. He was upset that Trestman went to the Ravens. He was talking about how he should come home to the Browns, the history of Trestman in Cleveland, and eventually why we cant get those guys to come back. It finally hit me during that conversation. As much as I hate the Ravens when you ask the old timers to come back and help the Browns, their friends arent in Berea. When they think of the old times, they think of Ozzy Newsome and the staff of the Browns Pre-95. All of Trestmans friends from the old days are in Baltimore. One day we will be back to being a contender, but I fear that we wont ever be what we were.

 As a Browns fan who lives in a culture that can't seem to find a QB in any round,  especially the first round, I just can't help but wonder how Belichick found a person at round 6 of his calibre? Can anyone with a better knowledge of these things explain it to me?

 I was pulling for Trestman to be our HC. I REALLY think we lucked out with Pettine, but think we have a spot on our roster for him to be the OC or QB Coach. I like him, his history with Cleveland, and his resume from the CFL. We could use some of that old school Browns energy back in the building. Especially when it has left and had success abroad..
 




 Do it through selective breeding.

 Pettine's might have made 2 or 3 mistakes all year. You can't mess with Pettine. He is the best coach since 99 and maybe even back into pre-relocation a ways.

 I feel the same way. Weird. 




 No. Totes was MadLibs. Check it out "You can *Verb* my *Noun* and run your *Noun* around the rim of my *Noun*".

All jokes aside, I just thought it was interesting. Hence the part where it says
Coincidence? Yes. 




 This is the thought that has me caught up. I really like the white ones too. I think they're sharp. I'm just a nostalgic goon and love the Seal Brown. Maybe I'm not looking at things correctly, and I should realize the white uni's aren't safe and may be gone next year, too. 




 True story. We have 2 Joe Ha(y)dens on the Browns. They are also arguably our 2 best players. Coincidence? Yes. 




 I am going to get one more jersey before we change to the new style. I already have a Seal Brown '40' that was given to me with "Hillis" scraped off and my name stenciled on as a gift (First Jersey) I then bought a Seal Brown Cribbs '16' and a Seal Brown Haden '23'. I pretty much know that I want a Thomas '73'. The question is, do I want to go Seal Brown again, or do I go with my first White Jersey? 

I want the Seal Brown because I worry we wont have them next year, and I think I will still be able to get a white jersey next year. But I dont have a white jersey, yet, and I think Thomas might be really sick in White. 

Suggestions? 




 I have heard from a buddy in Nebraska that he wasn't dirty at all in college and in fact had a large and positive following online. He surmised that there might be someone in the Lions staff that has coached him to play dirty. I don't follow middle America CFB, or the Lions, so I don't know. Just some insight. [Also, not everyone can be as cool as Spencer Lanning](http://imgick.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width620/img/browns_impact/photo/16359131-mmmain.jpg)  and that's something we just have to learn to live with. 




 This. 




 I live in Seattle and another win would mean another [huge ass, polite, party](http://youtu.be/Qo4z77OvznU) 




 I am the most badass epic legendary neighbor. Here is my story:

I moved into the most beautiful neighborhood near Atlanta, GA. Historic Druid Hills across from Emory University. My house was perfect in so many ways. I had my own room with attached smoking porch, a gourmet kitchen, roommates that I loved, music, fun, parties, pets. It was perfect. Until 10pm every night. I lived next door to this horrible old woman and her 90 year old mother. We shared a driveway that split at the end into each of our yards. Once noise ordinance set in, the police calls would begin. It was a never ending, revolving door of police visit after police visit.

Listening to classical music and cooking a late dinner? Police. 

Laughing at a game of Apples to Apples and watching Craig Ferguson? Police. 

But the night that changed me was the night I came home from working 3 jobs at 11pm. I was, in this order, a Lumberjack, Mexican Restaurant Waiter, Gormet Pizza Chef for Everybody's Pizza  and my day started at 6am.

All I wanted was a milk shake. Sometimes all of life's problems can be solved, at least in the moment, with a milkshake. All of the sudden I hear the 3 hard knocks of an irate police officer. I answer the door holding the blender.

"Hello, Officer. What is it this time?

He points to my blender. 

"Your blender"

I must have looked at him in a really messed up way, because he gave me this 'Don't shoot the messanger' look with his hands up, and said

"Look. Just be quiet over here. I sat outside and you aren't doing anything technically wrong, but she is going to call us every time she hears you and we are 
going to have to respond"

So, being at the end of my rope, I asked a question. 

"What time does ordinance lift?"

"5am" he replied, and turned on his heel to leave. I nodded, closed the door, hand stirred the rest of my milk shake, went to bed, and set my alarm.

5am came slower than Christmas. Once my alarm went off I sat up, combed my hair, brushed my teeth, got dressed, and removed my trumpet from its case. 

*it should be mentioned here that OP played one quarter of a year of trumpet in 5th grade.*

I made my way out to where the split in our driveways began. Standing just on my side of the property, I faced her house, and began the most discordant, obnoxious, sonically discombobulating, racket I could muster. After a solid 2 minutes, the meanest, morning faced, most mad, vile, fist clenched, woman you have ever seen comes charging out of her house at me. I can tell that she has probably just gotten off the phone with the police, and has been informed that noise ordinance lifts at 5am

"STOP IT STOP IT STOP IT!!!! YOU STOP THAT RIGHT NOW"

At this point she is stomping and spitting and her hair is starting to unspring from her head, and I put my trumpet politely in her face and blow it as hard as I can while attempting to play as close to a 26/33 cadance as I can get. She runs back into the house and a few minutes later comes back outside. I like to imagine she called the police again to tell them what happened and they  politely told her to flake off, hung up the phone and laughed to each other about the field this lady was reaping from her actions.

Once again she beelines over to me and tries to take my trumpet. I pull it away and jut my face towards hers.

"If you touch my trumpet I'll have you arrested. You want to own the night. I own the fucking day"

And for a solid week my trumpets calls could be heard all the way to the CDC.
*EDIT Spelling* 




 I live in Washington. It's true. You have to get money from the ATM for the dispensaries.  




 I did not expect such an amazing reaction to these!  Maybe I'll share my Batman comic I wrote. Not doing me any good since I can't get anyone in DC to look at it. At least someone would read it. Lol!

 I think you mean the top 3 teams that need a QB have the 1st, 2nd, 12th, and 19th pick. 




 Everyone is behind Manziel, giving him the D. 




 LOUD NOISES!  




 Biggest flop in the NFL is Manziel. 




 We are in desperate need of a quarterback.

 It's from his rookie year, and I think it looks pretty beastly too. 




 I think that this article nails it on the head. This front office/coaching staff is amazing. The movement to ManChild was perfect in its timing. We had enough time to see what he could do. Even after that shutout, the choice to play him again was the right decision. Connor Shaw was the correct decision for the Ravens. I'm more than satisfied with our infrastructure and the choices they have made. I trust, for the first time in modern history, that they will field the best decisions available to them.

 Totally. 




 Steelers and Stealers, indeed. 




 I am not buying a new style jersey until they make one with a 5 on it. Fucking Spencer Lanning. 




 Do you think they would stay on to coach? Starting as an intern on Special Teams and working to create a true culture of veterans, rookies and alumni working together to coach, lead, and play the Browns into a perennial winner? I hate to say anything ever about the Stealers, but Ozzy Newsome is amazing, and he is amazing because of his love not only for the game, but the organization he works for. They win because everyone still works together to make things happen. From the newest guy, to the most seasoned HoF-er, they still work with the team and add their energy to make it strong. I would love for either Joe to become a coach and stay on with us.  




 I really hope we get people like Ike Taylor retiring from our team. His article on BR about his outlook on moving into the next arena of football (coaching) is inspiring. "I never wanted to be anywhere else. Yes I'm retiring, but that doesn't mean I'm done. My next job for the Steelers can be without cleats. In an office. I can start at the bottom and work my way up. Just being here to help these guys become great is what I live for. Seeing my guys go from 4-5-6 on the depth chart to 1-2-3 is an amazing feeling. Do you need something? I'm the guy. Can I run to Walmart and grab it before the game? I'm 
 that kind of person" 

It's that love for his team, and the desire to be part of what makes it great, that has melted the black and yellow when I see him, and reveals the kind of player I want on the Browns. 

Here's hoping that the culture within First Energy has sweetened and tightened up enough that we begin breeding players with this outlook at the end of their careers. 




 [Hmmmmmmm.....]( http://www.meh.ro/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/meh.ro6390.jpg) 




 They look a lot like the 1946 jersey numbers.  




 Have they given designations to the new colors? We used to be Seal Brown, Pumpkin, and White. I know we have a pantone number for the orange that was referenced in an earlier thread, but do we know if they plan on naming them?  




 Oh my gods and goddeses and all that is holy and unholy and may get you to stop;  Stop. Just stop it. S. T. O. P. For the ever love of shutting the hell up.  




 I love them all,  so we will go with base 8 on all of them,  with the all white and all brown being 10's love them. The complimentary stitching is so sick, and the carbon fiber brown stripe on the helmet is stylish A.F.  




 I love them. F$^ #*g love them. The White on White is sick. The drop Shadow is a throwback to the pre-NFL days. Cleveland on the Chest is cool. Browns up the legs is cool. I love the juxtaposition (seems to be the word of the City right now) of old and new is there, and beautiful, and I can get behind my team looking this way. Brutal. And the minimal change to the Helmet was masterfully done. Classy, and Edgy. I'm sold. 




 Could it be possible that it has more ability to break up the color of the ball, so that it is more in line with the jersey color rule? 




 I like the Orange numbers on Brown. I really do. 




 Brown with orange numbers is awesome.  




 That's a stupid rule.  




 Beer is more expensive out here in WA. I spent the same amount of money, but I included 2 really nice 22oz bombers that were pricey, but DELICIOUS!

But flanking the Goddess, Herself, [are the two cans of Bernie Beer](http://imgur.com/vUozM3e), because obviously my man knew I would want to keep one unopened, and would also have to taste its Kosar-ie contents. Great trade! Thanks again /u/ohheyeverybody I hope you like what you have coming! 









 I am so ready. I have some great drafts in my fridge as we speak. I have such good beer in WA. Thanks for putting this together Pabsty. 




 I would replaced the blue with Brown. Because we're the Browns. Edit: Nothing personal.  Hate the Idea of adding grey.

 I'm a big fan of them both. I think that Crowell will be our goal line RB because he can always find 2 yards, where T-West will have more overall yards, because when he does break one off, He. Takes. Off.
 




 786yds, 9 rushTDs/2 receiving TDs. I see him as a goal line guy.

T West will have more yards, but less TD's. Prolly 950yds 4Rush TDs, 1 receiving TD. 




 All I know is a random Pro Football Focus article says that it happened, and all of the sudden it's everywhere as fact. I just want a link to someone in a front office saying that wither they the Browns, or they the other team offered or was offered this pick for that QB. I cant find it and would love it if someone could confirm or dent the existence of such an article.

 Ha Ha! Only someone who didn't do their homework could come up with an article as far off base as this one is. No research!

#1 Johnny's parents are extremely glad that he was drafted by the Browns. Not only has he gotten the help he needed but the Browns have set up a support system to surround him upon his release. Jimmy   Dee Haslam are oil people   so are Johnny's parents, they are friends that have a lot in common. The Haslam's are looking out for Johnny's best interest   the quote that backs this up is Coach Pet saying that, JM the person is the first thing that needs addressed. Imagine that, an organization that actually cares for the health   welfare of their employees. Not to mention that Coach Pet has taken time to go visit him. Being there for him   not turning his back on him in his time of need   surely the HC   QB are going to become close after this.

#2 Going through rehab myself I know what the things are needed upon his release   first   foremost is a great support system. The Browns have done that in both areas, work   personally. 1.They assemble an offensive coaching staff with the ability to transform these college spread QB's into the NFL. This is proved by each coach's history of developing QB's. Coach Flip called his offensive staff an all-star staff as his phone was ringing off the wall during the period he was doing coaching candidate interviews. Do your research like I have   you will see this, just read negative articles written by others that don't understand what is going on   we get articles like this. Whoever is the Browns QB is going to come to us from college   if you have the ability to transform a college spread QB into the NFL you will have a bigger selection to choose from as most college QB's are spread QB's   this won't change anytime soon so the NFL better learn real quick on how to coach them or they will have a T-shirt with 20 some QB's listed on it as well. This basically is a cutting edge staff put together with a whole lot of thought. Each area in a QB's development has a specialist that will work with him in that area. Plumber's do the plumbing, electricians do the electric, labor's do the grunt work etc etc. They have JM covered in all areas pertaining to football. They even have come up with a 24/7 plan for his week. How he will spend his time off the field as well.

The next part of the support system is a sponsor, someone he can call when he feels like he could relapse. Someone who cares   has his best interest at heart. Someone he can relate to   tell his deepest darkest secrets. The sponser is never a partner in crime, not one of his party buddy's would qualify as they weren't really friends, but friends just wanting something from him. Enter Josh McCown for a 3 fold purpose. He has the ability to be the bridge QB temporarily on the field, the desire to go into coaching when he lays the ball down is a plus for him as he is getting on the job training so to speak that is going help him when he does retire. If you heard Josh's comments about his desire to work with Johnny   when it's time for him to turn the ball over to Johnny or another QB he won't have a problem doing that. His own ego being put to the side for the best of others comes right out of the Bible. He is an example for Manziel on how he needs to feel. The perfect sponsor for Johnny is what Josh is. Not only that, but their home towns are only about 30 miles a part, they can relate in more areas then one   those jet ride homes with party boys will now be filled with the McCown family rather then his bling family. This goes deep sports fans   well thought out by a team that actually does care for not only his well being but others as well. Take note Josh Gordon if you are reading this. Johnny is leading you   providing an example for your good as well. Listen to his play call as once Johnny has gone through it, his next step in rehab is to sponsor others   help them get through it. The whole situation is looking good   the Browns are trying their hardest to be a team that can handle any type player. Whether they be on the wild side or the goody 2 shoes side, they will now be able to not be guided by fear in the draft, but rather could develop players like Dorial Green Beckham. Fear has lowered his draft stock   the Browns could benefit from that like the Bengals did with Vontaze Burfict who fell completely out of the draft because of the fear associated with him. The Bengals had a mentor for him in place that got his attention. That is what separates the AFCN from other divisions, they actually care about their players   don't care what ill informed writers have to say.

As far as surrounding him with receivers, that is not the first thing you do when building a team. When building a team you start with a plan. The Franchise QB has strength's   weaknesses that can become strength's with the right coaching in it's due time. But once a QB or your idea of a QB is established then you can draft according to their strengths. As the QB grows you may have to tweak your style   New England is a perfect example of this as their offense changes pretty regular. The OL is the most important area to support your franchise QB   the Browns have that, may need tweaked but the core is place. Then the running game follows,   the WR's after that, drafted or traded for or a FA, basically they can come from anywhere.

For Pete's sake this is only March   we won't know who is destined to come to the Browns until September, then we won't know how successful they were until the end of the season. Some of us can look at that vacant lot   envision the mansion on the hill. Then again, some can't   that results in articles like this guy wrote!

Meet Johnny's sponsor here! QB, Josh McCown, "My Heart is to Please God" Don't forget, Johnny is in a faith based rehab program.

 That would be "sir", but I appreciate it none the less. [Edit: Dusty Dionne is my legal full name] 




 No one is doing any such thing. Unless it's against the law to be afforded the same concessions under the law, as Christians.  




 Thank you, /u/zunjae

 So, I will tell you what I told a good friend: *"If the bill goes through, this will be part of what we will be coaching Wiccans to accept as part of their rights, and then we will start dealing with winning the court cases, and that will cement our rights. Change can be made, and if they give us a framework of law that they think is going to give them exclusive religious rights, then what we are going to do is set our beliefs into that framework, and we legally should have the same expansion of our rights.* **[EDIT: Forgot this part and it posted without me getting it put in:]** *Wicca has full government recognition because of the umbrella 501(c)3 that the ATC holds. What the ATC is doing, and does, is inform the legislature and our members of what Wiccan rights will be under their new proposed law changes. It is outside of the scope of the ATC's 501(c)3 to try to create new legislature or endorse or denounce existing legislature"* 




 Thank you. I wrote every, single, senator in Georgia and shared the original link to the [original article](http://www.panegyria.com/news/the-aquarian-tabernacle-church-outlines-wiccas-new-rights-under-the-georgia-religious-freedom-restoration-act). Makes sense for them to all know what rights to expect. Thanks again for the suggestion. Took me all day. 




 The ATC is pointing out where the new rights will expand into Wiccan territory. If the Government passes the bill, then new rights open up. Including rights surrounding marriage, taxes, and worship. Much like what the Christian Right thought would happen with allowing prayer in Louisiana public schools. They didn't realize other religions would have new expanded rights under the law allowing them to host public prayer, as well. 




 Totally a troll tactic. The link back was correct.  




 Thank you, [and this is to the exact post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/2yrfuu/the_aquarian_tabernacle_church_outlines_wiccas/)

 They are a pretty huggy people as long as you ask nicely. You could totally get that wish granted. 




 SB 129? I am in total agreement. 









 Well.... his arm is strong enough that when he throws it as hard as he can he knocks himself on his butt. I guess that's positive, kinda. 




 I called him a "Ding Dong" on twitter. I could have been nicer, but I don't think he deserves it. 




 Eeeeyyyeeeeaaahhhhhh...... We don't trade picks like that. Farmer has been nothing put a draft pick wizard in his one appearance pre season. [Still not convinced the 6th and 22nd pick were his ideas, even though he swears they were] 




 Farmer would never hook anyone up with a first round pick for someone with an injury track record like Bradford.  




 Come take a trip with Brianna Misenhelter as she speaks with Gabriel Matson on the ADF, his work with plants at Bastyr University, and his work with the ATC, Spring Mysteries Festival, and his role as The Dark Lord, as we walk down Pagan Paths! 









 I like Revis, but IS he still an island? Have the years dug a canal through him? This is serious. I dont know. 




 I love that people have downvoted this. Here, I'll be the person! "Let it go, man. You're making us look like a bunch of babies. When we start winning maybe we can have an opinion. He's dead, let it go. Stop having the rivalries that make us proud to be Browns fans, already. WTF." How'd I do? 




 I cant believe it actually went through! Now that posts from this account have been unFUBARed, expect a lot of good content from many great authors and hosts as I start bringing you podcasts from the Pagan Information Network [www.atcpin.com] and articles from Panegyria Magazine [www.panegyria.org] Blessings all, and happy soon to be Ostara! 














 You seem to be under the notion that they don't throw MORE OFTEN to Skrine so as not to throw it at Haden.  




 Thank you. I was in no way going to remove the possible piece of history, myself. I am going to take it to the Seattle Museum of Art, or the U. of WA. Thank you for the heads up. 




 How would one tell? 




 We run a non-Abrahamic denomination, church. We have just had our founder die, and the torch has passed. We were cleaning the church after he passed, and found this framed picture wrapped in a blanket in the back, often locked, closet in the bathroom. After showing it to our archivist, she came to the conclusion that it was real pencil and real watercolor, and the "foxing" on the paper would denote that it would be from around the 40's or 50's. Her next suggestion was to take it to the University of Washington. I brought it here, first.

 I have found a framed graphite and water color sketch framed in the closet of our new house. I will post a picture in the comments. 




 I found what could possibly be a Picasso sketch/painting. How would I best post for info on that?

 Tearing up Harrison (Harris-ment), which is even more awesome. 




 I appreciate the info! He looked like his work ethic and his in the locker room personality were above board. He spent the combine working out, and he talked about how important it is to be friends with the team and the coaches. Gratzi, again! 









 As much as I would like to think he will come back all better, as someone who came off of rehab with a girlfriend still using, it broke us up. If it hadn't, I wouldn't have stayed sober. It was one of the hardest decisions of my life. Since his drugs of choice are alcohol and social media, it would seem like his GF isnt going to do him any favors, unfortunately. 




  Pantone 2028 C

There we go. So then my next question: Who makes the official named designation of these colors? Such as 'Seal' Brown and 'Burnt' Orange? And do they have the plan to name this new orange, as well? 




 Huzzah  




 No.  It's iconic for classic football.  




 Do you know why that's considered 'a stock helmet picture? Because we made it iconic. The stock photos  are  copying us.  




 That's awesome.  




 I don't know if you're correct, but I like it. 




 Burnt Orange and Seal Brown were the old guard. What is the technical new designation of this vibrant, new, orange? 




 It should show people how important a decision this is based solely on how much this has encompassed all of football. It's the Yankees changing to polka dots. It's gonna be weird. Does that mean 'bad'? No. 'Change' and 'Pain' exist in the same region of the human brain. It's gonna be different, but that doesn't mean bad. 




 Thank you!  




 You are absolutely correct. Even our own solar system is actually moving in a three dimensional spiral, but that is a much more in depth conversation.  Good call, though.  




 So let me understand this. [The Cavaliers use a 'C']( https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/542030215027781632/BrO34cMY.png) and [The Indians us a 'C']( http://content.sportslogos.net/logos/53/57/full/006wvt6wf3g02vqhx7yofazqv.gif) and now The Browns? Fuck copying the Bears, we are copying ourselves copying ourselves with that one. [No sir, I dont like it.]( http://www.meh.ro/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/meh.ro6390.jpg) 




 It's one of the best things about the medium of online text, in my opinion. Since there is no inflection of tone, and no distinctiveness in ones handwriting on the web, it stands to reason to find the best way to do that within the medium. [For example: On reddit it would have looked like this](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/double-take.gif)
 




 ALSO, it is an imaginary equator that runs through the galaxy, much like there is an imaginary line through the middle of an Astrological Natal Chart. Our sun turns around the center of our galaxy the same as the Earth turns around the sun, and a person could map that two dimensionally on a piece of paper as a circle with 12 pie segments. Our earth moves through 3 segments every season in a circle, eventually coming back to a starting point. In the western world, we consider this January 1st. The same exists on a macrocosmic level for the galaxy. Only instead of it taking 30 days per segment, it takes 2100-2600 years. And instead of calling it a 'month' we call it an 'age'. [I'm sure there is a leap epoch in there to make up for the math.](http://media.giphy.com/media/10yeJtpwWcFrAA/giphy.gif) 




 [Our sun moves around the enter of the Milky Way much like our planet moves around our sun. Like in this picture.](http://en.es-static.us/upl/2011/01/Milky_Way_face-on_edge-on-e1342743292482.jpeg) We move through ages (Like the Dawning of the Age of Aquarius) every 2100 years or so. Aquarius is the beginning of spring in the Astrological sense. *Edit: I have changed the article to reflect that I am speaking of the Galaxy, not the Universe. Thanks for pointing that out /u/longducdong. also, Awesome name*
 




 I wrote this article based on my own decade of study in the world of metaphysics. Come learn a little about the end of the Mayan Calendar, and what I think Galactic Spring just might bring about for us here on Earth. I hope you enjoy, and I hope it brings forth discussion.
