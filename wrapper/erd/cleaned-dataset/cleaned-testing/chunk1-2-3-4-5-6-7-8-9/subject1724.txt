 Just got one, and it was setup in under 5 minutes. 

(StillGoing) ChicagoVPS - 2048MB RAM, 50GB Disk, 2TB Bandwidth, 2x IP address $40or$30/year - 4 Location Choices
ChicagoVPS is now offering a 2GB VPS for $40 per year, this time with 2 IPv4 addresses and now offer an additional location option (Atlanta)

UPDATE: The wiki went bye-bye, don't know why. Look at post 5 for most of what was in there.

UPDATE: I just found a code that seems to give you almost the same deal at $30, 2GBYR 
More info from Kevin: 
to clarify about the $30/yr deal. It is valid for the "Enterprise" plan listed here: http://chicagovps.net/openvz.html. It only includes 1x IP, and is only valid for our Chicago, Buffalo, and LA location (Not Atlanta). The $40/yr STEALOFADEAL offer is separate order links like I gave you earlier, and includes 2 IP addresses. It is also available in our new location Atlanta.

This is not technically a repost, because the other thread about this particular deal got deleted. The STEALOFADEAL offer actually costs $10 more than the previous deals, and it comes with 2 IP addresses. 

2048MB (2GB) Dedicated Ram
50 GB Diskspace
2TB Monthly Bandwidth
100Mbps Port
2x IPv4 Address with STEALOFADEAL
1x IPv4 Address with 2GBYR code, but $10 less, but no Atlanta
SolusVM/OpenVZ
Instant Setup (most of the time)
Free Backups
3 or 4 Location Choices: Los Angeles, Chicago, Buffalo, (Atlanta on the $40 code)

$40/year with promo code "STEALOFADEAL"   2 IP addresses
Order in Chicago, IL - https://billing.chicagovps.net/ca...dd pid=160
Order in Buffalo, NY - https://billing.chicagovps.net/ca...dd pid=161
Order in Los Angeles, CA - https://billing.chicagovps.net/ca...dd pid=162
Order in Atlanta, GA - https://billing.chicagovps.net/ca...dd pid=163

$30/yr deal. with 1 IP address and no Atlanta
http://chicagovps.net/openvz.html - Choose Enterprise, 1 year recurring


The promo code to use is STEALOFADEAL or 2GBYR- over $200+ in savings Just be sure to select the 12 month billing cycle when ordering then on the next page you will find the option to enter in the promo code. This price doesn't go up after the year is up either.

When signing up, use an easy password, and change it later. Some folks had trouble with complicated password during signup.

Disclaimer: I don't work for, nor am I anyway associated with ChicagoVPS. I have one VPS with this company, and I paid $40 for it. They aren't giving me anything. Yes, I know they should, but they haven't. 

What is this, you may ask? It is an online Linux computer that you have root access to, and can install and run practically anything. Read the TOS, 'cause that doesn't include P2P sharing, folding, bit coin mining, seti stuff, and anything else stupid like that, that might kill the performance for everyone else. 

Anyways, like I said, you get root access to a Linux box, and when you screw that up, no problem, they give you a control panel that lets you reinstall a new OS in minutes. Pretty cool. With a small effort, you can even vnc into it with a full GUI.

Don't expect the world from this, you get more than you pay for. Think twice before you bet your business on this, although I think there are people that do.

 Cool! 




 I guess NewsBlur changed it from 64 to 12 free feeds due to the incoming traffic? 

 




 I think because FeedDemon relies on Google Reader for synchronization. 




 The few times I requested support he responded. 




 Nick Bradbury, the author of FeedDemon is closing. See http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2013/03/the-end-of-feeddemon.html

That was the nail in the coffin for me. I hate to say goodbye to FeedDemon after a decade of working on it, but it's time to say goodbye. When Google Reader shuts down on July 1, FeedDemon will also disappear. 




 Same here. Most of those have disappeared over the last few months but I also went premium.  




 If you are concerned about privacy then I would look into a self-hosted solution like  http://www.feedafever.com/ ($30) or http://tt-rss.org/ (free) maybe. 




 Yes, I like it as well. Seems to work well and it looks like it imported most of my feeds in one shot.  




 http://tt-rss.org/ is back up but it's a self hosted solution (free). 




 Same, I am most likely going to go with a self-hosted one like http://www.feedafever.com/ ($30) or http://tt-rss.org/ (free) as those seem to be the best for me right now.  




 This is probably from the crush of traffic? Mine updated automatically before all this.  




 I had trouble with some feeds on import. But then again I can't be sure if this was due to the load. It was simpler to manual subscribe to the ones I had problems with.  




 I'm using http://theoldreader.com/ now to test. I also need to check out and recommend looking into https://www.newsblur.com/ http://www.feedafever.com/ and http://tt-rss.org/redmine/projects/tt-rss/wiki

 Yeah, looks like you have 90 days. Via http://blog.reybango.com/2013/02/04/making-internet-explorer-testing-easier-with-new-ie-vms/

Time Limits on the VMs

All of the VMs have a time limit before the images will become either limited or unusable. Heres what they are:

IE7  IE10: 90 days of total time from the moment you first use the VM. Basically its 30 days usage with two 30-day rearms.
To rearm, go into a command prompt and type in slmgr rearm
IE6 on WinXP: Will expire 90 days from the time we upload it to modern.IE. Theres no rearm it but well keep this refreshed when the 90 day kill date nears.
At the end of the 90 days, heres what will happen:

IE7  IE10: Youll be able to use the VM for an hour before it shuts down
IE6/WinXP: Youll be prompted for an activation key with no way to get past it 




 So do these still expire after 90 days?

 I don't think you can run the game or let alone install it without Origin. Like Steam, Origin needs to run while you play Origin games as far as I know.

 Summary:

If /lib64/libkeyutils.so.1.9 or /lib/libkeyutils.so.1.9 exist on your server, it is very likely that your server has been compromised. Removing this file appears to be a temporary fix, but since the attack vector is still unknown, that is not guaranteed to be a permanent fix.

Based on community input, it appears that RHEL-based servers are the only ones affected so far. Servers with control panels such as cPanel, DirectAdmin, and Plesk are also affected.

From Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crane_fly

 Contrary to myth, crane flies do not bite humans, nor do they consume mosquitoes. The larvae of some species are carnivorous on other small invertebrates, sometimes including mosquito larvae. **Many adults, however, have such short life spans that they do not eat at all.**

Stuff in bold makes me sad.

**Futuristic War Reporter**

Hey guys, here is something I did recently. This is something I wanted to try for a while after seeing all of those awesome futuristic sci-fi close up shot of a military personel from Maciej and all the other amazing artists. But I didn't want to do the exact same thing, a military lady with guns and body armor. So I did a little spin off, a front line reporter, someone who bring you the news from the war zones.

 Not sure about breaking a bone. But having had cancer and had to declare bankruptcy a year later I can tell you that it was expensive. I think I still have a picture of my $135K bill from the hospital and I was not done yet after 2 1/2 months of treatment.  




 When cancer comes back... 

Having had cancer and survived it. This scares me the most. The possibility that cancer will return in a stronger more lethal form is something that keeps me up at night.  




  Its time to call America what it is: a kleptocracy, run by corporations and governments with only cosmetic distinctions. It is full of good people whom the kleptocrats keep fighting against each other, as they have for over 150 years, and will until the good people drown in rising saltwater or epic storms, or simply die, exhausted and used up. 




 Looks like you can buy it from iTunes or Amazon and get your money back. See http://recode.net/2014/03/15/warner-brothers-to-veronica-mars-backers-ok-ok-use-itunes-or-amazon-if-you-want/ 




 I was just going to say this as well. Sounded to good to be true.  




 I know this breaks rule 2   3, but you should read his story as it pertains to cancer and insurance.

It wasn't until a few weeks ago when the formal denial letter came through that the gravity of the situation really hit home: because I hadn't lied when I saw my first doctor -- because I'd told them that I'd had stomachaches at any point in the past five years, whether or not I'd gone to a doctor for it -- I'd fallen under a fine-print pre-existing condition clause that said that any signs of illness that could possibly have led a doctor to a diagnosis since 2008 were cause for denying any compensation for any ailment of pretty much my entire alimentary canal.

 Taken from this awesome comment @ http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1v48v3/supercomputer_takes_40_mins_to_calculate_a_single/ceom6lx 

 Very important correction - this is the original article and the computer simulated one percent of a human brain.

EDIT: As /r/terkala points out, if we follow Moore's Law out then we get to realtime in 24 years.

1 (percent of a brain)/2/4/8/16/32/64/128

Realtime simulation of a human brain in 2053, by a computer which is super-gigantic and consumes just under 10 MW. So to get this down to the size of a human brain, we'll need to keep pushing Moore's Law out.

The K Computer uses over 80,000 SPARC64 VIIIfx processors, so it's about 10,000 times the size of a human brain (leaving out the cooling systems and wiring and so forth).

10k/5k/2.5k/1.25k/312/156/78/39/19.5/10/5/2.5/1.25

SO: Viable android brain in 2080, if wild and dubious assumptions can be taken as fact. 




 Thank you!

 The Role of the Monopoly Game http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_(game) in World War II.  




 This was years ago, not sure if it's an attack.

Someone in HR god fired but they did not inform IT, well not at least till the next day, even then late in the day. :(

When this person went home after being fired in the morning they connected to Sharepoint and started to download all sorts of documents like payroll   salaries, contracts, expenses, bonuses, agreements, etc. and then proceeded to email them to everyone in the company. In no time everyone knew what everyone was making, how much they received for bonuses and raises, etc. 
 




 This is what I do as well. I have a few low-end servers via Rackspace, DigitalOcean, and AWS distributed in multiple regions.

  The Columbine massacre was an event that would change lives across the United States, including Ledonne's. Within a few years of the shooting he would be at the center of a fierce media firestorm, demonized in the press by Columbine survivors, and the target of open abuse and death threats. While countless others publicly came to terms with the shooting by making films, books, plays or music, Ledonne dared to use a different medium: He made a video game.
 
 He made Super Columbine Massacre RPG!

 PIL - The order of death is my favorite track from the movie. Closing credits I think.  




 One of my favorite movies growing up. 




  The poison in question is temozolomide, a chemotherapy agent thats specifically used to treat brain tumors.  I once read the label, with its biohazard trefoil, and stopped when I saw the word cytotoxin.  That means cell poison; it attacks cells that are dividing, as cancer cells always are.  But it attacks all dividing cells, not just malignant ones.  A growing five-year-old has a lot of dividing cells, and we are poisoning them all.  We just hope that were poisoning the cancerous brain cells more than other cells.

 A reimagining of the Star Wars prequel trilogy edited into a single compelling movie, based on the structure conceived by actor Topher Grace.

 According to http://rev967.com/how-much-is-your-kidney-worth-on-the-black-market/ a Kidney is $262K on the black market.

Assuming the rumors are correct then this drive depending on model will likely be between $9,999   $12,999 range.

 All of the others you've listed are either stateless REST services or places that want small pieces of structured data.
 
 EFS is NFSv4 which means:
 
 * Stateful (authenticate once, probably kerberos)
 * Mountable AND shareable (EBS can only be mounted in one place, S3 can be shared but not easily mounted)
 * Actual directories. No S3 doesn't have actual directories.
 * On-the-wire operations (I don't have to download the entire file to start reading it, and I don't have to do anything special on the client side to support this -- it just looks like a normal POSIX file handle)
 * Shared unix permission model (S3 doesn't do actual unix permissions. EBS does, but can't be shared).
 * Tolerant of network failures (UDP IIRC with plenty of retry logic) So I can actually open a file remotely, seek around all I like, and if there's a network problem it will just wait for the problem to resolve rather than forcing my client to deal with exceptions (configurable, of course).
 * Locking! Clients can actually correctly lock files. Let's see S3 do that.
 * Better caching than S3 -- clients can actually see what all of the other clients have been doing and make informed choices about whether to use a local cache or refresh the cache from the network.
 * Big files without the hassle (no multipart upload / multipart download, 64 bits for file size = potentially huge files)
 
 There's probably more I'm forgetting.
 
 EDIT
 
 Who says you don't have to mess around with mounts? EBS makes you mess around with mounts. Maybe not if you use a pre-made AMI, but if you go right now and add an extra EBS drive to an existing EC2 instance you definitely have to mess around with mounts.
