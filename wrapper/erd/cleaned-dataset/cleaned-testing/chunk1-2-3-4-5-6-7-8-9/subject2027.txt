 Welcome everyone to GTSIM. It has been just over two weeks since I started this sub and it has grown rapidly. We have 996 subscribers as this is posted and I expect it to pass 1K by the time most of you read this. 

First of all, I want to thank all of you for upvoting and subscribing. There isnt much interaction in terms of comments and submissions, but that will change soon as we grow. Most of the posts are mine, and I am fine providing content while this sub grows. If you guys think I am submitting too much or not enough,  let me know. 

Secondly,  I want to thank /u/dontgive1011 for his css contributions. If you guys have any feedback on the look of the sub, send a modmail or post on this thread. 

Lastly, please start contributing more content. Even if its just a picture you see on another sub or website and think "thats a gtsim shot," feel free to xpost it here. And if you find a discussion out in the front page subs where this sub is relevant, name drop it, even as a joke. It seriously helps. For example, many new users hear about /r/gonewild from someone making a joke about it on a default sub. Try dropping those hints but with /r/gtsim if it seems relevant.

Together we can grow this sub.

I'm still a new mod and I am learning so if you have any concerns,  advice, suggestions, hate, or love, let me know. Even if it is just to let me know about a typo on the sidebar or something. 

Thanks, test_subject2027. 






















































 This happened two years ago. We were having a bbq before a game and he prepared some veggie burgers and I made some meat burgers. He mushed his veggie burgers up real good and it actually looked like meat after we cooked them. We put the leftovers in the fridge and went to the game. 

When we got back I was a little bit drunk and was hungry so I opened the fridge and grabbed what I thought was the left over meat burgers. 

It was a mis steak.

 What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? Ill have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and Ive been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills.

I am trained in gorilla warfare and Im the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words.

You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. Youre fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and thats just with my bare hands.

Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little clever comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue.

 I changed the sub default.  



















 I made the sub nsfw for default. Although there isn't nearly as much porn as I was expecting. I'm considering making it normal and just tagging individual things.

 There was this forest beside my school and I would go there and build forts. 

One of my friends, lets call him caleb, because thats his name, would go with me sometimes. We usually worked during lunch or after school since we both rode our bikes home and our parents got home late. But sometimes we just skipped school to do it. It started out small, with carving paths between these short palm trees. Four of them made a nice "room" area and you could carve paths between 2 to form "hallways." We worked on this for months. 

But the entrance was near our recess area and one day someone saw us going in. They of course told everyone and the next day at recess, dozens of kids are trampling over our fort. It hurt. It felt like an invasion of privacy. It was our hard work and they were trampling all over it. 

Well, as the administration does for harmless things  they over reacted and banned us from going in the forrest. A couple weeks later, caleb and I got a detention for being back there. 

That didnt stop us, that made us more determined. We would rebuild. We went further back into the forrest and found this place where someone dumped house construction scraps. Plywood and 2x4s and miscellaneous things. We started making a huge fort and using these things to build. The trees were taller further back and it was a heck of a challenge, but two kids with some determination can do alot over 2 years in middle school.   
























 That the world doesnt exist and was all made up around us a la Matrix style. Or even like The Truman Show. Imagine that the world really is a stage and everything is fake. Every friend you have is an actor, every place you have been to is a set, every road or plane flight you have been on has just been circles you drove in. What if the maps were wrong and that road trip you went on was just a loop that kept you in something the size of your state? What if every interaction you ever had was orchestrated by a producer of a show pulling the strings.

How would you know?

That is the biggest thing about this. The most appealing. How could I prove it, that it is all a lie. I used to think about this a lot in high school. We really would have no way to prove it. I ended up realizing that there is no point in thinking about it because there is no way to prove it sufficiently. 

And suppose it was matrix style. What if we were on a computer? Our brain is all electrical signals anyways, what if we were a brain in a lab being probed and every smell, image you see, thing you feel, idea you remember is an electrical signal coming from a computer putting it there. 

How can you prove that the world actually exists in the way we think it does? What if we were just some game, some 3rd grade martian's science fair project? We wouldn't know any better than a sim in your video game would.

 My bro and I used to be really close even though we were 9 years apart in age. His dad left our mom before he was even born and he never met him. My dad left when I was 2 and he was 11 and I barely remember him. Because of this my mom had to work two jobs to support us. One of those jobs was at this engineering company where she worked as a cleaning lady. She worked from 9pm to 5am as did all the cleaning staff so that they wouldn't disturb any of the engineers. 

Because of this, my bro and I would spend a lot of time together. We became really close and even though he had a decade on me, it wasn't like a weird father-son relationship where he had to take care of me. I bet I had to take care of him just as much as he did me. We would do whatever to calm the boredom of being alone so much

When we weren't getting in trouble, I remember we liked to play on a used n64 my mom got from one of her friends who's kid got a PS2 for christmas. We would play the crap out of it. We liked to play either mario64 or donkeykong64 and we would play on the same account to try to complete as much as we could as quickly as we could. When he couldn't beat something, I would, and vice versa. We also liked to jump this fence right next to our house that blocked off a canal. He would always have to help me up but once we were over we would play around over there. It was fun finding abandoned stuff like washing machines and other trash. We also would go in the forest and make forts. One time we found this place where someone dumped scraps from a house construction. We had a bunch of oddly shaped plywood boards and some 2x4s and made this huge fort. 

We would hang out there a lot until my uncle told me there were snakes over there and I was too afraid to go over again. 

Our song was Kyrptonite by 3DD. We started liking it when his friend got a playstation and we would go over and sing on singstar. We were always good at that song and put our entire effort into it. After a while we would just start randomly singing that song and it became *our song*.

In 2006 he went to college and left me. When he first left we would talk on the phone like every other day and he would fill me in his classes and tell me how different everything was. After enough time he started making new friends and our calls became weekly, then monthly, and when exams came we barely got to talk. His sophomore year I bought him the *The Better Life* CD for his birthday. I shipped it to him because he wouldn't be able to come home for his 20th birthday. 

He got it 3 days before his birthday and called me and we talked for hours. We hadn't talked in couple weeks so catching up was good. He was getting into the core classes and was learning VHDL which is a hardware description language that EE's use and he had to design a processor for a class. He was swamped with work but still talked to me. After so many years of listening to this song, we never had gotten the cd. 

He was going to college to become an Electrical Engineer because of the stories our mom told us about the engineers from her work. She would always describe the labs and the work on their white boards with us and always told us she wanted us to go to college. She wanted us to have a better life. The better life. The CD was perfect in every way. He wanted to help my mom move into a real house. He wanted to help pay her back for all what she had been through for us. He wanted her to never have to worry about money again. 

He told me about the processor project and about a solidstate class he was taking where he learned about the physics of transistors. He told me about the people he met at his school's IEEE club and about a design competition he wanted to enter. His team was considering something on placement aware devices. The idea was that if your phone could know where it was, it could change setting such as ring load if in a bag or vibrate softly if on a table. 

It was good to talk to him but that call, like all others, came to an end. 

Everything was normal for two years, we would talk occasionally, he would fill me in on the awesome things he was learning and I wouldn't have much to tell him about middle school but he would still listen and give advice. 

Two years later we got a call.

At 11pm an officer called. My mom was at work so I had to take it. He told me that my brother was in an accident and to notify my mom. I froze. I didn't believe him. I wanted it to be a joke. I hung up and collapsed on the floor crying. It felt like I was hit by a brick wall. I couldn't swallow, couldn't breathe, couldn't move. I felt cold and had no idea what to do. After I managed to stop crying I called my mom. She asked me if it was a small accident, if he was ok, or what. I repeated what the cop said, that he was in the hospital. That was all I knew or managed to understand from the cop. 

My mom got someone to take her work and my uncle drove us 5 hours to my brother's school. We had no idea what was happening in the mean time. My mom called the hospital a couple times and they updated her but didn't want to release too much over the phone or something. When we got to hospital at around 6am, a doctor told us he had died at 4:56. I remember it hadn't even been an hour so we must have gotten there a bit before 6am. A girl was leaving a party and was drunk and ran a red. My brother was on his way home from a lab and she crashed into him. The cops said she was speeding when she lost control and barrelled through the intersection. She had been ejected from her car and landed off to the side on the pavement. My brother was crushed in the car. 

After a couple months she recovered fine and was sentenced to probation. The judge said some bullshit about how she was a good student and this was her first offense. "The knowledge that you took someone's life was enough of a punishment." I was so mad that she got off so easily. I followed every news article relating to her, tried to get as much info about her, basically stalked her. She seemed so happy, had no remorse. She ruined our lives and gets to forget about it eventually. 

Thats what it is like to be 13 and lose your best friend. 

I eventually got over her a couple years ago. I finished high school last year. Life goes on. I got into my brother's college, started last semester, and I am going to be an Electrical Engineer too. There isn't a day I don't think of him. I want to get my EE degree for him. Do what he wanted and help my mom. 

To live a better life. 

I can't even listen to that song anymore. 

I will always miss you, superman.  










































































 Honestly, if you are still not like sub 1:00 to like sub40 consistently, the cube wont matter. I suggest getting a decent cheap cube on ebay, like a 5-10 dollar. I just checked canada ebay and there are a few decent ones. The important thing is learning all of PLL and OLL, and getting fast at F2L. I used a broken in rubiks brand with lube until I was sub 45 consistently. Then I switched to a zhanchi and have had it for a while.  




 Can we talk about this for a second? Why are M and E slices on the secondary faces? Why just those two? Why couldnt everything just be relative to RUF? This always bothered me but I just learned it "cuz thats the way it is." 




 I used his page to learn. It is a wonderful resource. Also check out his algorithm changer if you try to make your own algs using cube explorer or something. And if I remember correctly, he has a eoline scrambler that you can input the number of bad edges you want and it will return scrambles for that. 

And for last layer stuff, also check out [petrus' s site.]( http://lar5.com/cube/index.html) The last layer stuff and the last block stuff is relevant, as well as subsets of the general block building stuff. He has a neat 2-alg 1 look LL idea. 

E: cant find the EOline scrambler that I mentioned, but I found this on the speedsolving wiki: [eoline solver]( http://rubiks-cube.c0.pl/inne/eoline.html). I havent looked at it because Im on my phone though.  




 I do zz and once you get past eoline, it is blazing fast. I am currently learning COLL and that is comparable to OLL in amount of algs anyways, so if you dont know OLL (which I never learned full OLL either) then this might be an option. Also, COLL is useful if you do K4 on larger cubes or roux or a couple other methods and is a good precursor to full zbll if you wanted to go that route. 

Also try roux or petrus. They start out with a lot less structured block building so if you have difficulties with that, ZZ is the way to go. I seriously considered petrus before settling on ZZ. The last half of your solve is similar in petrus and zz anyways. You just orient at a different stage and your first block is more intuitive 

EOLine will be the biggest hurdle for you when starting. If you decide to go that route, I suggest taking eoline slow. Dont do eo+line because you will get in the habbit. Just slowly plan out eoline and do it with your eyes closed then check it. After a couple weeks you should be good.  




 Give me your password and I can find it for you.  




 If you want to be friends, just be friends. Fuck what everyone else says. And if more comes from it then so be it. Unless you really really want a friendship or dont see her like that. Then establish some ground rules about what is happening and what can happen.  




 Why though. If you decide to ignore everything everyone said and claim it was a conspiracy, then why? Letting it run its course is enough of a test. A 20 minute outage is not sufficiently a test because plenty of people would not have seen it.  




 Maybe you can get on tv. Chris hansen has a new show comming out.  









 People that "made" the months did it a long time ago and kind of estimated. A month is about the length of a lunar cycle, for example. And you will find that a lunar cycle is actually a couple days short of a 30 or 31 day month. But a long time ago it was "close enough."

Also, they used to use seasons for crop growing and didnt need to be dead on. A couple days off was ok. You will find that throughout history, the length of a year, amount of months, and all those details have changed a bit. 

The issue comes down to relating a precise system based on astronomical events, and a system that humans use and can remember. It would be confusing if a year was 365.25 days and that was divided into 12 blocks of 30.4 days, etc. Weekends and holidays would be weird every year and stuff like that. So we kinda adapt the traditional stuff with the stuff we know is accurate today, and every couple years adjust the calendar (leap years).

It is possible for us all decide to shift the year and say, have summer start on the 1st of june and stuff like that, and we have shifted the calendar before in human history. But today it would take so much effort to coordinate that between 7 billion people and fix all the software issues that come from it and all that. 

So the short answer is: its not aligned because our ancestors didnt align it centuries ago.  




 TL;DR  I ducked up.

FTFY
 




 Am poor, plz halp 




 It would further strengthen my disbelief 




 Thats it?.. 




 Yea, checking your tubes is a 3rd date kind of thing.  




 My penis is fully erect from this coversation, I'm caressing it just like I would to what would be left of your penis if you were here with me. I can just imagine it, blowing my load on your face. Your stubs (I'd make you an amputee and tun the hole in the stubs into mini anuses, like any good owner would) clawing at my crotch begging for more of my hot mayo. You're searching for something aren't you anon? The reason you're so angry and have one night stands with the wrong people. Once you come with me you'll become a part of me, no wait, an extension of me. I'd do whatever I want and you'd just roll your eyes back into your skull, arch your back and beg for more. Trust me anon you'll love it, they all do. 




 Actually, I wouldnt be surprised if it was cooler inside now that you mention it.  




 Brojob!  




 That would be doing the friend a favor.  




 Your body yearns for those temptresses, but does your heat? My penis is fully erect from this coversation, I'm caressing it just like I would to what would be left of your penis if you were here with me. I can just imagine it, blowing my load on your face. Your stubs (I'd make you an amputee and tun the hole in the stubs into mini anuses, like any good owner would) clawing at my crotch begging for more of my hot mayo. You're searching for something aren't you anon? The reason you're so angry and have one night stands with the wrong people.

 Eww 




 Blue. Because red is my favorite color and I always get a red toothbrush, except I didnt this time so I remembered.  




 Did she like them? 




 And a couple weeks ago, and a couple more weeks ago, and a year ago like it is done every year, aND OH SHIT I JUST REALIZED MOTHERS DAY IS THIS WEEKEND!! FUCK, I need to get something.  




 Same thing 




 I never bought any of that "size matters" crap until my junior year in college. I lived in the dorms with two roommates, David and John. David was a pretty ordinary looking guy, kinda quiet - but John was tall, lean, muscular and (according to him anyway) was hung like a bull. He used to joke about it a lot - even around my girlfriend, Amy. Amy was a sophomore and was petite, shy and somewhat quiet. I didn't like it when John would make his "big dick" comments and jokes around Amy, but she told me she didn't pay any attention to him and truth be told, she really couldn't stand John.

I have a 5.5" dick and with Amy being so petite, it always seemed to do the trick. I was only the third guy she'd ever been with and only her second boyfriend - maybe my guard was just down but who knows.

Anyway, one Friday night, Amy and I were hanging out in my dorm room drinking, smoking some weed and watching TV. David and John had both gone home for the weekend - or so we thought. At about 1AM (Amy and I were pretty toasted by then), John walked in. He'd ended up hanging out with some of his friends off campus and had decided to just drive home in the morning since his parents only lived about an hour and a half away.
He could see that Amy and I were both pretty hammered. He grabbed a beer and sat down and we smoked somem more weed with him. Amy was pretty drunk and started giving John shit. John seemed to get a kick out of it and I could see him kinda flirting with Amy. Then I noticed (and hoped that Amy wouldn't) that John wasn't wearing any underwear.

But Amy started massaging my dick through my jeans and being so fucked up, I just laid my head back and enjoyed it - I couldn't believe she was doing that right in front of John! I heard John get up to pass Amy the joint we were smoking and I heard her gasp, long and deep and she suddenly stopped stroking my dick. I opened my eyes and saw John standing righ tin front of Amy with a HUGE fucking bulge in his pants - just inches from her face. The room was so quiet you could have heard a pin drop.
He just stood there and I could feel her hand tremble and hear her breathing quicken. when she slowly looked up at him, almost in awe and respect, I could feel my heart start to pound in my chest. Then she softly whispered "ohhhhhhhhhhh" as she gingerly reached up to brush her finger tips across that massive knot in his pants. When she touched it, it throbbed - shit I could see it throb thorugh his pants - Amy just gasped again and looked up at him.

"What?" John asked her and just kinda laughed. Amy did NOT laugh. Instead, she softly asked "can i see it?" John stopped laughing, looked at her very seriously and told her to take it out. Amy never even hesitated - or looked back at me for an "OK" - just just obeyed him and began to open his jeans. I coudl see her nipples rock hard under her t-shirt and I could tell she was practically panting.

She opened his jeans and his big thick dick just fell out...and he had NOT been kidding. That cock was strong, thick, heavy and muscular. The head was a big purple mushroom that sat on top of the thickest shaft i'd ever seen. He was semi-hard and was HUGE compared to me. Amy just gasped and kept whispering "ohmygod..ohmygod...ohmygod". When she wrapped her hand around it, her brow just knotted in disbelief and she almost laughed at how thick he was - her fingers couldn't even touch.
John just stood there watching my girlfriend worship his magnificent cock. Slowly shaking her head in disbelief, she two-fisted him - one hand next to the other...and there was STILL a few inches left - and he was getting rock hard, too.

Amy smiled and patted the couch next to her and John sat down, his cock standing straight up. Honestly he had to be almost 10" (judging from the size of Amy's hand). I opened my pants and took my own cock out. Amy took my cock in her left hand and John's in her right - but there was little doubt whose cock was getting more attention. She couldn't take her eyes off his cock and her hand only occasionally stroked my dick...but John's she pumped with long, purposeful strokes until she finally couldn't help herself any longer and knelt in front of him, kissing his cock and rubbing it against her soft pale skin.

She sucked his dick until SHE came - just from sucking him! I stroked the whole time until he pulled her toward him, peeled off her pants (she didnt even make the slightest attempt to stop him) and sat her on his lap, her back to his chest - the two of them right next to me. She just rolled her head back to kiss him as he squeezed her tits through her shirt. Her hands went down and pushed that big cock against her pussy and she groaned so loud when it touched her that I thought people outside would hear.

John's dick was so fucking big that he easily penetrated her from behind with her sitting on his lap. She arched up so she could take as much of it as she could and they started to fuck right there next to me. It shocked me how easily her petite little body accomodated that horse cock of his. John pounded her in positions that i physically CANNOT do for over an hour - I have no idea how many times she came - she was even in tears a few times (though she never once told him to stop).

He asked her if she was on the pill and when she said she was on the patch, he told her that he was going to cum inside of her to mark her - which only made her cum again! when he finally came, he had Amy on her back, her legs shaking violently as they both came together - and true to his word, John dumped his seed deep up inside my girlfriend's pussy right in front of me. But shit - he didn't even lose his damn hard on! They fucked for about another 40 minutes and he came twice more. Amy was a wreck by the time we all went to bed.

I will never forget the look on her face - like she was afraid of him and in love with him all at once - the whole time they fucked. She later told me that there were no words to describe it - it was incredible but even that didn't seem enough. To my knowledge they never fucked again and Amy and I dated for about another year before we finally broke up. I always wondered if she ended up with him or some other big dick guy.
But one thing I know for sure - she NEVER fucked me like she did John and the things she said about John - the way she looked at him - and the way she was around him after that night (almost shy and meek) convinced me that a big dick makes a difference.

Amy told me that she "HAD to respect him" even if she didn't like him...and that she almost felt like he "had a right to her". So there ya go. 




 Why do we care about the button at all? I mean it's an interesting game of keeping the number away from zero, but other than that, this sub is devoid of content. Nothing beyond 6 colors and a timer. Yet why do we care so much about this program which in reality doesn't affect our lives at all?

(btw If you don't like reading, go read the TL;DR at the bottom)

I have watched this sub ever since the day it was born, and it has been interesting seeing the masses get so "excited" about this april fools joke. (Just to be sure I'm not saying that this whole sub isn't *nothing* but an april fools joke, the users have definitely turned this sub into something of meaning for themselves). But there shouldn't be this passion for the button. There is literally no earthly reason for there to be factions of colors and "discrimination" between them. And yet there is a community for it.

This whole brouhaha is very reminiscent of twitch plays pokemon. Yet the difference between twitch plays pokemon and r/thebutton is that watching a character being controlled by thousands of people in a game that almost everyone inputting commands has played is much more compelling to watch and to be apart of than watching a timer. And so the people who were a part of twitch plays pokemon *had* *a* *reason* to sit there and watch the screen. But watching the character get on and jump off a ledge became repetitive. So repetitive in fact that they gave personality to the pokemon (Abby, bird jesus, the false prophet). Those who watched created a religion (Praise helix). They tried to create reasons for why certain things happened (why they looked at the helix fossil so often). They were confronted with a void, and subsequently tried to fill it. And it was wonderful. It was arguably one of the greater internet sensations of this decade. And those who were *in* on it from the beginning had pride in what they were a part of. They felt like they belonged somewhere.

Now, once again we were confronted with something that is community based yet devoid of reliable entertainment. Many recognised this and tried to recreate the magic of TPP. The same thing could be argued for the Orangered/Periwinkle april fools. Hell, this sub was probably inspired by that.

 But this isn't TPP. There is no reason to stay in this sub beyond literally watching a timer. It was soon apparent that it was difficult creating any meaningful OC, so we turned to something which worked before, factions/religions. Only this time, it was artificial. It grew too quickly, and was simply too forced to be anything like TPP. But we ignored the elephant in the room. We closed our eyes, put our hands over our ears, and shouted about how much fun this was.

Every person is desperate for a sense of belonging. We want to feel like they are a part of the group. We all want to be accepted. We all want to be able to say something, and have someone else back us up. Some of the actions on this sub can be attributed to this need of acceptance, but can you seriously argue that this many religions and factions can be created so quickly? For something that is so meaningless? 

This whole sub is a circlejerk. Just social masturbation about how awesome we all are for choosing to take sides over pressing the button. We are all self aware about this situation. No one is seriously thinking that red's are better than purple's. They just want others to think, "woah those guys are so wacky, they created a whole RELIGION. They are so dedicated for something so meaningless. They are sooooooo interesting and funny". 

This whole sub, down to it's very roots, is fake. And by saying that, I'm not saying that greys don't hate purples (not only because it's so freaking obvious), I'm saying that the very reason for typing in the words "filthy pusher" isn't *because* of the community. The people who type in "filthy pusher" are trying to *create* a community. They are trying to create a community that wouldn't have ever come about on its own. That is what is fake about all this. Its kind of sad in a way.

This sub is great as an idea, but everyone is so freaking self-aware of what they are doing. I know what this april fools joke was supposed to do. To create divide between people just like the Orangered/Periwinkle did. Except this time everyone knew how to act, and overemphasized the factions despite there being no reason to be on this sub at all. The Orangered/Periwinkle thing worked because it was the entirety of reddit, people had a reason to go on reddit that was much greater than simply bashing the other color.

Now this may not matter to you, but for me, I really hate it when people try to indirectly steer a topic/community/conversation/idea/etc into a direction it would have never gone to if we all would have just called out the bullshit. Call me cynical, but let things grow naturally on their own.

TL;DR 

**This sub's community is not 'real' in a sense. It has never been honest. People realized that, and forced it in anyway. The only reason why this bastardized community exists is because we all want to be a part of the next TPP or Orangered/Periwinkle.**

 Why not? If someone is willing to buy it, you could polish a turd. The commenters are the ones that are buying this polished turd. You are right that it was forced and the analogy to a polished turd is excellent, but just like gold, a worthless rock, it has value because people give it value. 

Once the button runs out, I dont think they would put it in the code for, say, "innitiate the launch sequence" or "send this command to that specific server." That would give it away. There is probably something monitoring it or one of the mods will do something once it runs out. To say that "because the code doesnt give it away, then nothing will happen," is a little bit jumpy. 

And how is the button not emotional? The factions wouldnt have formed if someone didnt feel anything about it. Yea we cant vent the same amount of steam as running 4 miles during a soccer game would allow us to, but we still get to vent some. The small victory we get from watching the button survive another day is something. The arguments like this are small football games we play with each other. 

You keep saying that the button is not as great as life or sports, and I already said the analogies are stretching on my side, sure. Yea the button is not the next great sport we will watch on payperview, but that doesnt mean that the elements are not there. That doesnt mean that the small victory of a small three pointer is meaningless. You called it meaningless and im saying it isnt. Yea there are way better things we could use as stimuli, but there are also worse. 

The button isnt the "next best thing," but it is still "a thing."  




 Wtf seriously?  




 You are right that the comparison to life is a gross oversimplification, but I dont agree that the button brings nothing. It brings the excitement of the unknown after the inevitable end when it reaches 0. It brings the conversations like this. It brings the ability to waste time. While it is not as rich as life or other subs in the stimulus it could bring, it still brings some. 

The factions that formed and the monitoring and stats that people collect is like a sport. You could argue that basketball or soccer is pointless. You chase ball around trying to complete a menial task like putting something in a net or pressing something. All for what? To affect a counter? And we do it over and over again and people devote their lives to it? People get so good at it we pay them millions to do it. 

While button pressing doesnt require the skill of a pro athlete, back in the day sports werent as organized or at the high level we are now. The button is like the birth of a new sport or religion and its still forced, disorganized, and sloppy. It looks pointless from the outside like it looks pointless for 22 guys to run around with a ball. 

The beauty of this all is that it shows that humans can take nothing and make a sport out of it. In the quest for entertainment, we can formalize any simple task and make rules and follow it all seriously like we have the button. Beerpong, football, hopscotch,  writing, are all simple tasks that we make complex rules (or in some cases not so complex) and follow and play professionally or at an amateur level just for entertainment. And beautiful things come out of it. 

The slight bit of adrenaline that we get from pressing the button is comparable to the adrenaline from racing. The competive nature that came out when factions formed is not unlike fans following different teams. 

Life can provide many stimuli, and the button is one of them.  




 Who is to decide what has a point? The point of a thing is the reason its users give it. You could attempt to use the same logic to diminish cell phones, the internet, or life itself. 

What is the point of life? We are born cold, crying and naked, then the majority of us struggle every day, and we all die in the end. The whole process would be much easier if we all died now in the same way that the button would be much easier if we all ignored it. 

But what is the fun in that?

I keep working a 9-5 and doing what I do, despite the inevitably of it all, because occasionally I derive pleasure from the flowers or from the sun or from my frend's laughter. We continue to come to the sub because we derive pleasure from the mindless clicking and the community and factions and inside jokes.

I respect your opinion even though I disagree and I do think it is awesome that you are sticking around and replying even though everyone agrees with you. But the button and its pointlessness is an extension of reddit and its pointlessness, and of the pointless inevitable nature of life in general. 

If anything, this discussion has made me realize how much deeper the button really is.  




 And there are a bunch of people that enjoy this site without the button. Whats the point? 

Some people enjoy being karmawhores, and some people enjoy pressing buttons. The preference of others (on how they enjoy a site) does not diminish the way other people use the site (especially when so many use it in those ways). 




 I completely agree with you. I changed the post into a karma copypasta in my other reply to show how OP's ideas can relate to anything. Im from the United states so let me drop another example. When we were a young colony, everyone laughed at the rebellion and the "cute little colony" actin' up. You could say it wasnt a real thing, it certainly wasnt a "real" country yet. But in a way it was a thing because the group of people, the founding fathers, everyone that lived here, wanted it to be a real thing. They made their own laws, own states, own rules and traditions. And after a while it became a thing. 

We make new subs all the time. The need to belong aside, a sub isnt any less of a sub than a default because it is new. If there is a community that contributes, then it is a real thing. A "circlejerk" isnt any less real because it is a circle jerk. However rushed or forced it may be, close to a million random people have come together to press the button, and millions more have come to form a community and everything that comes with it. 

The factions and silly politics, if anything, reinforce how much of a "thing" the button really is. 
 




 
Why do we care about the karma at all? I mean it's an interesting game of keeping the number away from zero, but other than that, this site is devoid of content. Nothing beyond 600k subs and a counter. Yet why do we care so much about this program which in reality doesn't affect our lives at all?

(btw If you don't like reading, go read the TL;DR at the bottom)

I have watched this site ever since the day it was born, and it has been interesting seeing the masses get so "excited" about this joke. (Just to be sure I'm not saying that this whole site isn't *nothing* but a joke, the users have definitely turned this site into something of meaning for themselves). But there shouldn't be this passion for the karma. There is literally no earthly reason for there to be factions of linkers/commenters and "discrimination" between them. And yet there is a community for it.

This whole brouhaha is very reminiscent of twitch plays pokemon. Yet the difference between twitch plays pokemon and karma is that watching a character being controlled by thousands of people in a game that almost everyone inputting commands has played is much more compelling to watch and to be apart of than watching a counter. And so the people who were a part of twitch plays pokemon *had* *a* *reason* to sit there and watch the screen. But watching the character get on and jump off a ledge became repetitive. So repetitive in fact that they gave personality to the pokemon (Abby, bird jesus, the false prophet). Those who watched created a religion (Praise helix). They tried to create reasons for why certain things happened (why they looked at the helix fossil so often). They were confronted with a void, and subsequently tried to fill it. And it was wonderful. It was arguably one of the greater internet sensations of this decade. And those who were *in* on it from the beginning had pride in what they were a part of. They felt like they belonged somewhere.

Now, once again we were confronted with something that is community based yet devoid of reliable entertainment. Many recognised this and tried to recreate the magic of TPP. The same thing could be argued for the Orangered/Periwinkle april fools. Hell, this site was probably inspired by that.

 But this isn't TPP. There is no reason to stay in this site beyond literally watching a counter. It was soon apparent that it was difficult creating any meaningful OC, so we turned to something which worked before, factions/subs. Only this time, it was artificial. It grew too quickly, and was simply too forced to be anything like TPP. But we ignored the elephant in the room. We closed our eyes, put our hands over our ears, and shouted about how much fun getting karma was.

Every person is desperate for a sense of belonging. We want to feel like they are a part of the group. We all want to be accepted. We all want to be able to say something, and have someone else back us up. Some of the actions on this site can be attributed to this need of acceptance, but can you seriously argue that this many subs and factions can be created so quickly? For something that is so meaningless? 

This whole site is a circlejerk. Just social masturbation about how awesome we all are for choosing to take sides over shitposting the new queue. We are all self aware about this situation. No one is seriously thinking that linkers's are better than commenters's. They just want others to think, "woah those guys are so wacky, they created a whole RELIGION. They are so dedicated for something so meaningless. They are sooooooo interesting and funny". 

This whole site, down to it's very roots, is fake. And by saying that, I'm not saying that commenters don't hate linkers (not only because it's so freaking obvious), I'm saying that the very reason for typing in the words "filthy karmawhore" isn't *because* of the community. The people who type in "filthy karmawhore" are trying to *create* a community. They are trying to create a community that wouldn't have ever come about on its own. That is what is fake about all this. Its kind of sad in a way.

This site is great as an idea, but everyone is so freaking self-aware of what they are doing. I know what this joke was supposed to do. To create divide between people just like the Orangered/Periwinkle did. Except this time everyone knew how to act, and overemphasized the factions despite there being no reason to be on this site at all. The Orangered/Periwinkle thing worked because it was the entirety of the internet, people had a reason to go on the internet that was much greater than simply bashing the other shitposters.

Now this may not matter to you, but for me, I really hate it when people try to indirectly steer a topic/community/conversation/idea/etc into a direction it would have never gone to if we all would have just called out the bullshit. Call me cynical, but let things grow naturally on their own.

TL;DR 

**This site's community is not 'real' in a sense. It has never been honest. People realized that, and forced it in anyway. The only reason why this bastardized community exists is because we all want to be a part of the next TPP or Orangered/Periwinkle.**

Except this time everyone knew how to act, and overemphasized the factions despite there being no reason to be on this site at all. The Orangered/Periwinkle thing worked because it was the entirety of the internet, people had a reason to go on the internet that was much greater than simply bashing the other shitposters.

Now this may not matter to you, but for me, I really hate it when people try to indirectly steer a topic/community/conversation/idea/etc into a direction it would have never gone to if we all would have just called out the bullshit. Call me cynical, but let things grow naturally on their own.

TL;DR 

**This site's community is not 'real' in a sense. It has never been honest. People realized that, and forced it in anyway. The only reason why this bastardized community exists is because we all want to be a part of the next TPP or Orangered/Periwinkle.**
 




 Why do we care about the button at all? I mean it's an interesting game of keeping the number away from zero, but other than that, this sub is devoid of content. Nothing beyond 6 colors and a timer. Yet why do we care so much about this program which in reality doesn't affect our lives at all?

(btw If you don't like reading, go read the TL;DR at the bottom)

I have watched this sub ever since the day it was born, and it has been interesting seeing the masses get so "excited" about this april fools joke. (Just to be sure I'm not saying that this whole sub isn't *nothing* but an april fools joke, the users have definitely turned this sub into something of meaning for themselves). But there shouldn't be this passion for the button. There is literally no earthly reason for there to be factions of colors and "discrimination" between them. And yet there is a community for it.

This whole brouhaha is very reminiscent of twitch plays pokemon. Yet the difference between twitch plays pokemon and r/thebutton is that watching a character being controlled by thousands of people in a game that almost everyone inputting commands has played is much more compelling to watch and to be apart of than watching a timer. And so the people who were a part of twitch plays pokemon *had* *a* *reason* to sit there and watch the screen. But watching the character get on and jump off a ledge became repetitive. So repetitive in fact that they gave personality to the pokemon (Abby, bird jesus, the false prophet). Those who watched created a religion (Praise helix). They tried to create reasons for why certain things happened (why they looked at the helix fossil so often). They were confronted with a void, and subsequently tried to fill it. And it was wonderful. It was arguably one of the greater internet sensations of this decade. And those who were *in* on it from the beginning had pride in what they were a part of. They felt like they belonged somewhere.

Now, once again we were confronted with something that is community based yet devoid of reliable entertainment. Many recognised this and tried to recreate the magic of TPP. The same thing could be argued for the Orangered/Periwinkle april fools. Hell, this sub was probably inspired by that.

 But this isn't TPP. There is no reason to stay in this sub beyond literally watching a timer. It was soon apparent that it was difficult creating any meaningful OC, so we turned to something which worked before, factions/religions. Only this time, it was artificial. It grew too quickly, and was simply too forced to be anything like TPP. But we ignored the elephant in the room. We closed our eyes, put our hands over our ears, and shouted about how much fun this was.

Every person is desperate for a sense of belonging. We want to feel like they are a part of the group. We all want to be accepted. We all want to be able to say something, and have someone else back us up. Some of the actions on this sub can be attributed to this need of acceptance, but can you seriously argue that this many religions and factions can be created so quickly? For something that is so meaningless? 

This whole sub is a circlejerk. Just social masturbation about how awesome we all are for choosing to take sides over pressing the button. We are all self aware about this situation. No one is seriously thinking that red's are better than purple's. They just want others to think, "woah those guys are so wacky, they created a whole RELIGION. They are so dedicated for something so meaningless. They are sooooooo interesting and funny". 

This whole sub, down to it's very roots, is fake. And by saying that, I'm not saying that greys don't hate purples (not only because it's so freaking obvious), I'm saying that the very reason for typing in the words "filthy pusher" isn't *because* of the community. The people who type in "filthy pusher" are trying to *create* a community. They are trying to create a community that wouldn't have ever come about on its own. That is what is fake about all this. Its kind of sad in a way.

This sub is great as an idea, but everyone is so freaking self-aware of what they are doing. I know what this april fools joke was supposed to do. To create divide between people just like the Orangered/Periwinkle did. Except this time everyone knew how to act, and overemphasized the factions despite there being no reason to be on this sub at all. The Orangered/Periwinkle thing worked because it was the entirety of reddit, people had a reason to go on reddit that was much greater than simply bashing the other color.

Now this may not matter to you, but for me, I really hate it when people try to indirectly steer a topic/community/conversation/idea/etc into a direction it would have never gone to if we all would have just called out the bullshit. Call me cynical, but let things grow naturally on their own.

 I remembered it being only 1 so I looked it up. Its dimensions are 24,00040,000 km east-to-west and 12,00014,000 km north-to-south. Earths Diameter is about 12.7k km so I probably remembered that it was 1 in the North to South direction. Two to three can fit overall as you said. Also, if words alone dont make you feel small, check out [this comparison]( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/Jupiter%2C_Earth_size_comparison.jpg/1280px-Jupiter%2C_Earth_size_comparison.jpg )

Also kinsmed is right that it is decreasing in size.   
At the start of 2004, the Great Red Spot had approximately half the longitudinal extent it had a century ago, when it was 40,000 km in diameter.

 Mike drove out there and he is dead now 




 Hmm, checks out 



















 That mike guy lol 




  almost all

and I never said I wasn't obsessed with anything, I was just pointing out the hypocrisy of calling out someone for being obsessed with the button. 




 Im not saying that, im saying that it already popped out. Once it is there, they can either choose to have mods or not have mods. If they dont have mods, they dont make more money. If they do have mods they can make money, and deserve to too. But should they get greedy on that money? Even if they ask for 1%, they will still make more money than before. I dont know where the line should be, but the issue everyone has is that 45% for bethesda is a little bit past the line, wherever the line may be. Especially for something that adds to their game.  




 Does that mean its fair though? Yea they bring a lot to the table for a modder, but do they bring in 75%? I dont think so. Yea sure they deserve a cut, im not saying the modders should get 100%, but dont be greedy with it. Especially since at the point that the mods are made, valve takes on no more risk. The platform and game are already made at that point. The mod is just like icing on the cake. Valve isnt putting in any dev risk, any time, or any money into bringing mods out. Other than what they already do. 




 Automod deleted trolla's comments because the cruel humans programmed him to remove any reddot/facebook/twitter links. He was just doing his job and got hate for it.

 Similar to gold, it is in the ground. People dig it up, crush the rocks it is found in and collect it. Only a few countries do it. Once it has been collected, some other guys make sure it is pure enough and that it has the right amounts of the right isotope. Once that is done, they form it into pellets and ship it off to the power plants.

I look forward to the day when all bots are treated this fairly.  









 But at that voltage, taking into account the resistance of human flesh, not much current will get to you. 

When they talk about amps on batteries, they mean the max amp draw or they say amp-hours which is a measure of capacity. 

A circuit will draw the amount of current it needs. A gigaohm resistor will not draw much current, but a motor (which is basically a wire coiled up) will draw a lot more. Your flesh has a very high resistance that varies with humidity and other factors,  and if the voltage isnt too high, you wont get that much current through you. Its not like the battery just forces 30A into everything it gets connected to.

 Not unpopular at gay bars 





























 I think thats a lovely thought. Throughout the history of the universe, everything conspired against the collection of atoms that became you. How improbable is it that this galaxy would form the way that it did, and the solar system, and earth, and the continents. How improbable is it that we would all evolve. That your parents would meet. That they would have a kid. And of billions of sperm, the one that resulted in you is the one that made it. And we get to have our blip of time in the universe before dying and going back to starstuff to wait for the inevitability of the violent death, or not so violent death, of the universe. The earth will fall into the dying sun and the dead sun may be swallowed by a black hole and any mark of humans will be gone forever. Even if any other life exists out there, they wont know about us probably.

But through all that and before the inevitable,  we get to be here today to share this random moment on the internet. We get to live our share of a half dozen decades and make friends and have experiences and be happy and sad and feel. 

I think its rather lovely that we get to ponder our existence, for however brief the moment may be.  




 I bet their guestrooms dont even have a guestroom for their guest's guests.  




 I think its rather nice

 /u/preggit 




 Yea thats true. My reply was really snarky.  




 Cuz I saw that dick pic you posted and it made me so hard. I just imagined stroking it while my hard cock throbbed under my underwear.  I want to suck you off untill you cum all over my face and then when you do I can bite your dick off and swallow it and feel your hard black cock in my tummy so you will always be a part of me. And then I will stretch out your new hole and stick my dick in it. And I will start fucking you with our bloody lube while you squirm and scream and it will be so hot. And then when I cum I wanna go down on your hole and suck out our bloody cum mixture while it drips down my chin. 

 




 And that sucks but you are just unlucky. Statistically there is a correlation between things like smoking and lung cancer,  or wearing sun screen and skin cancer. 

Yea yea its "risk factors" but it still reduces your chances and if you dont take statistics personally, there does appear to be some relation.

 Estimates though.  if I said 5k that is also technically wrong. And 4k is in the range of "give or take"

Also, you replied to yourself, not me. So, you h8 yourself? 




 Yes 




 When a small business is starting up they arent profitable for the first year or so. And for the next year they may be just about cutting even. A small increase in costs would hurt. 

Where as a large corporation can shift around a few million here and there when shit happens and not bat an eye.  




 Yea, we need more tax laws 














 20 bucks give or take, so 20-5k is negative 4.98k, which means they give you 4k.

 Because it is an extension of humans and humans are dicks. But humans are also nice and very sweet and you will find that on reddit as well. 




 Woah, they will give me 4k to do it? 




 And large corporations will find ways around it like firing people and cutting other things. The small business cant afford to let go of their one or two employees.  

Small family run businesses would get screwed harder than it seems on the surface.  




 Sounds like a good start 




 I bet your dad takes bubblebaths though.  




 Just like feminism and many other "movements."

The edgy 13 year olds are more vocal and annoying and end up becoming the face of the movement because the serious ones arent forcing their opinion on people and trying to do something about what they believe. 

The same with religion, many people think a lot of Christians are like the Westboro baptist church but in reality the ones I have met are nice and make a difference in their communities. But WBC gets media attention because they whine the loudest. 

And I have met good athiests too. And I have met decent feminists too. 

But you are right, it is comical how the image of all these movements is what they tried to fight.  




 Or you got a lot of bullets and a good vest 




 People tend to wait for their turn to talk about their opinion than to actually listen to your argument.

Her look of "wow this idiot" makes me cringe and die a lil every time I remember, which, the way my mind works, is every 5 minutes.

 Many of us identify as the nerdier types. This show is based around mocking the nerdy types.  Thats offensive. Also, many of the things in the show are dumbed down or just plain wrong and thats annoying if you actually understand or know about what they are talking about. So while it appeals to the majority of people, the vocal majority of reddit is not exactly its demographic.  




 Stick to your username.  




 Also, walking too close to people. Close enough to slam into them if they stop suddenly.  




 Chewing with your mouth open. I work with a lot of foreigners and it blows my mind how that is ok in oyher parts of the world. It is obnoxious, gross, and annoying.

 Depends on the delivery method. Rudy once dared me to snort it and like hell I would turn down a dare. Well, I couldnt see for a day, had a headache for 3 days, and tasted apple juice for the next week.  




 Nothing. 

You will get ugly houses from the outside and they turn out to be nice on the inside, and vice versa. 

I met a kid in elementary school that was so sweet and softspoken. He always shared everything and complimented people and was polite to teachers. But when we hung out we would ride our bikes around outside or he would come over to my house. But we never went to his house. 

One day someone brought up this and they kept pressuring him to let them in. One kid even followed him home a couple times. It was weird. Anyways, a couple years later after we are friends for a while he let me in his house. 

It was gross in there, his mom was a hoarder and had trash everywhere, he had three older sisters and two of them had their own kids living there, his grandma and his dad and apparantly an uncle who just moved out had lived there. It was like 12 people in a small 2 bedroom house. The walls and carpet were dirty and it was all messed up. 

But he was always clean, his nails cut and hair in place. The outside looked good and I had no idea that was inside.

His mom had some mental issues and wasnt working and his dad was supporting all of them so they lived so poorly because of that. And I remembered years before when we made a big deal cuz he didnt let us in. I wouldn't let me in either. Kids are cruel. 

And im sure the reverse happens where unkept looking houses look ok in the inside. You cant judge a house by its outside and you cant judge people by their houses or their families.  




 Because you dont hear about it plastered all over the news.  




 You can be, if you use it right. 




 Marry them 




 Talk to them and tell them they exhibit this behavior and that it is annoying. Tell them you are happy for them when they win and would like for them to be happy for you every now and then too. And if that doesnt work than they might be a bit immature and you have to start xonsidering if you want to be with that type of person or if everything else that they bring outweighs one small, or not so small, flaw.  




 Just come out the closet man. Theres a support system for you.

 Apples dont grow all the time so when they are in season they harvest a bunch extra and store them so that they can steadily distribute them throughout the year. This is why you always have a fresh supply of nice apples where as other fruits and vegetables are always out of season. The way that they keep the apples so long, in addition to selecting seeds for long lasting apples, is that they can control the atmosphere around the apple. Its oxygen for the most part that causes an apple to ripen and change colors and eventually go bad. 

So they store crates of apples in this huge wharehouse with a low oxygen, high nitrogen and other gas mixture. 

Now, the way OP's pic happens is that over the months of storage as the gas levels drop and humans enter and all that, some gasses escape this wharehouse and the nitrogen levels drop. You will get on the top crates apples that start aging much quicker. I have seen this happen, I play an apple engineer on reddit and have absolutely no idea what I am talking about. 

The apple in OP's pic must have been at a boundary of the nitrogen and other gas mixture and the top half was exposed to oxygen and started aging and the bottom half was in this cryogenic life preserving gas and didnt age at all. You can trust me. I swear.  




 Thanks lol. And I googled before posting, and that guy was wrong.  




 Here's the thing. You said a "pelican is a seagull."

Is it in the same class? Yes. No one's arguing that.

As someone who is a redditor who studies pelicans, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls seagulls pelicans. If you want to be "specific" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.

If you're saying "aves class" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of aves, which includes things from shoebills to sea eagles to toucans.

So your reasoning for calling a seagull a pelican is because random people "call the white ones pelicans?" Let's get grackles and blackbirds in there, then, too.

Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A seagull is a seagull and a member of the aves class. But that's not what you said. You said a pelican was a seagull, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the aves class pelicans, which means you'd call blue jays, ravens, and other birds pelicans, too. Which you said you don't.

It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?

 Yea I agree with you. It was sarcasm. That is the usual excuse the government gives in these cases and it is stupid but some people still eat it up and that is incredibly dangerous as you said.

 But reddit imgur, amirite guise? cuz imgur only exists cuz of us so their community is baseless and not allowed to be their own.  




 Your normal user that wants to download that one lizzie maguire album and just read a tutorial from 2007, yea. Just because you know how to use a different DNS doesnt mean the "average" garden variety one off torrenter knows how to.  




 Then if you arent doing anything illegal why dont you just use a normal browser so we can track you and use it against you later? If you arent doing anything illegal then you dont have a reason to hide. Only criminals hide really, so clearly everyone on tor is a criminal.  




 While google's and Microsoft's policies may not be the best, there are still laws in the US. I doubt a judge would allow that on the off chance that they might be hosting tpb. It is akin to a judge granting a search warrant just in case you might be breaking the law. There has to be some evidence that they are actually using one of those servers, the same way that there has to be some evidence of you doing something or some reasonable suspicion that you are involved for a search warrant to be granted. 

Now, that doesnt stop the possibility of a idiot judge letting it through or the government using shading NSA tactics and then making up a paper trail later to say it was legal, which they arent unkown to doing. 

But with that said, I doubt it would be all that difficult to trace if one of your users was hosting a certain site, but im only a lawyer and web dev on reddit and have no experience with either in real life so im just talking out my ass. Tpb guys are smart and have a complicated system of redirects going on so its not like google can just check and say "oh this user is sending a lot to this ip that belongs to tpb." And for the same reason it is hard to track from the website to the server it is really being hosted on.

 Dont worry about it too much. Just stop thinking about them watching you because they arent watching you, they are busy worring about you watching them, which you arent, because you are too busy thinking about them watching you while they are not watching you. Savy?

And you dont have to mantain eye contact every second.  Thats actually weirder than watching someone eat. Just look at your food and eat, and occasionally look up to make eye contain and verify to the other person you are still engaged.

 When you move things you require energy. the faster they move, the more energy they need. When you make your car go faster, for example, it burns more gasoline. Well, the math says that if you wanted to make your car move at the speed of light,  you would actually need infinite energy. 

You cant have infinite energy. So you cant go the speed of light.

The people who type in "filthy pusher" are trying to *create* a community. They are trying to create a community that wouldn't have ever come about on its own. That is what is fake about all this. Its kind of sad in a way.

This sub is great as an idea, but everyone is so freaking self-aware of what they are doing. I know what this april fools joke was supposed to do. To create divide between people just like the Orangered/Periwinkle did. Except this time everyone knew how to act, and overemphasized the factions despite there being no reason to be on this sub at all. The Orangered/Periwinkle thing worked because it was the entirety of reddit, people had a reason to go on reddit that was much greater than simply bashing the other color.

Now this may not matter to you, but for me, I really hate it when people try to indirectly steer a topic/community/conversation/idea/etc into a direction it would have never gone to if we all would have just called out the bullshit. Call me cynical, but let things grow naturally on their own.

TL;DR 

**This sub's community is not 'real' in a sense. It has never been honest. People realized that, and forced it in anyway. The only reason why this bastardized community exists is because we all want to be a part of the next TPP or Orangered/Periwinkle.**


 














 Ive never done it before in a speedsolving sense. I l've played around with roux before but never really done serious solves. I was dumb and didnt review some stuff before I began the solves or practice or whatever. I ended up figuring out to place DF and DB, then orient and then permute. And I knew the orientation algs from bld and I use [MU] algs for H and Z perms but the second solve I got a U perm.  I completely froze and then messed up. I ended up figuring out to use MU2M'U2 which is a 3-cycle I use in bld, and then just setting up the U perm to be solved with that alg. 

Once I figured that out and got the hang of it, the last 3 solves went ok.

 This seems like an excellent method.  I was doing zz before but I might switch to this. Do you have a website with algorithms or something?

Step 6 looks a little tricky, but I guess its comparable to Eoline or something.  




 Dude, the yellow cross. its done already. Thats it. Then you move on to step 2.  




 Im not a cfop solver anymore, but here is some motivation for [multislotting]( http://cubeloop.com/?page_id=327). Also check out badmephisto's [advanced f2l]( http://badmephisto.com/f2l.php). 

Note that the most improvement can be found in first moving your normal f2l algs into muscle memory (so practice on not intuitively breaking up the pair and doing sexymove) and also on getting good at look ahead (while doing the cross start tracking the first pair and while executing each pair start tracking the next pair). Some thing that will help with look ahead is to slow down and plan ahead as far as you can, speed will come with time. 

That said, on to multislotting. Something you can do is when you get a scramble, redo the scramble multiple times and try to solve a different f2l pair first each time. By mixing up how you do them, you might find that after execution, the next pair is lined up perfectly. When you see this, stop and undo what you did. Check the pattern and try to memorize it. Write it down somewhere. Then later on when you are solving, see if you can fit the pieces into some of those patterns you found.  




 http://cube.crider.co.uk/algtrans.html 




 But for things like k4 or a jumping off point to zbll, they are good to have. And with practice it can get close. After COLL, 75% of the time you will have a U perm or a skip. I think that makes up for it.  




 Ive read that about sune cases. Everyone seems to hate them. The recognition is not too hard. At least not as bad as people make it seem. Look for a pair of opposite stickers on the top layer. They will either be diagonal, horizontal, or vertical. Once you found those two stickers, you only need to match one more. 

For example,  for sune (do antisune on a cube to set it up now so you can see what I am saying) you have the diagonal case. U of UFR and U of UBL are opposites. I like to match with L of ULF and so I check and find that U of UBL matches L of ULF. So that is sune. 

If, instead UBL and LFU didnt match (do R U2 r' F R' F' r U' R U' R' U2 to set it up) you see the diagonal like for sune, and then you see that UBL and LFU dont match, so you know to do the other alg. 

For the vertical bar case (UFR and URB are adjacents) you have to make a slight modification and compare URB with LFU because UBL isnt part of the pair. 

Niklas is a horizontal bar (UBL and URB adjacents) with no match (UBL and LFU are different)

It takes some practice but I find that its not much more difficult than the bowtie cases. 




 **2x2**: 10.48, 15.81,9.48,19.51,12.08 = 12.79

That spread on [MU] lol. 




 Im a couple days late, but I want to add something and you might appreciate it. When you have a corner and bottom layer edge paired on the somewhere on the cube, some times the other corner is 1 or 2 moves away from being placed with this 2x1 block. So you end up with the 3x1x1 block and if you are used to cfop insertions, you will have to break it up. Or you can learn the 3 cases and solve an entire f2l block in a 7 move alg or so. That is just an example of the freedom of blockbuilding everyone else is talking about.  




 Oh ok, I understand. Sorry. 

On ebay canada I saw some Zhanchis for like 10-15 bucks, some moyu's for the same price. On auction you can save a couple bucks if you have the time. 

But yea, hit up the general discussion thread and Im sure a canadian can help you out more with cheaper cubes in canada. 









 Lmao M2 OH 




 Lol 100 in an hour (on the high end) is reasonable too. That would be insane.  












































 This is on the way up to the angel trail head on the south rim.  




 [Album]( http://imgur.com/a/5DLCr). It was a 24 mile rim to rim hike last week. The weather was actually really nice when I did it. It was my first time seeing the Grand Canyon and it was amazing.  









 For real doe 



















 Yea exactly. And I had hulu for a while but like netflix more. The newer shows on hulu offset the commercials because it is cheaper than cable and the commercials are shorter. You have some control on commercials. 

I get it when people complain about "paying for commercials" but hulu is the lesser evil between cable and itself. Assuming you dont also have cable.

 Aww you caught me.  




 Best I can do https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Chew_%27Chewie%27_Chan 









 Reddit is a link aggregation site. The whole point started out as linking other people's stuff. The truth is that /u/gallowboob posts high quality and relevant content,  so what that he didnt create every single picture himself.  




 And he contributes a lot of shops on /r/photoshopbattles and /r/birdswitharms. He also posts sources for most gifs. 

Yea he occasionally reposts, but for the most part its crossposts and original stuff. And he interacts with reddit and spreads content. I would honestly be less entertained by reddit if he and other linkers werent here. 
 




 Yea I havent had cable for years either. Too cheap/poor to buy it when I moved to my apartment at school.  And then after I moved out I was used to no tv. And splitting a netflix account costs me a couple bucks a months.  




 Chem to EE for me. As hard as the engineering circlejerk goes on reddit, some of the other majors are so much harder.

Its my second highest comment 




 I ran a candy business in middle school 




 Cant find the video that im thinking of, but he got a call from a telemarketer and set them up saying the account holder had to talk to him and it would come to the phone in a sec. He then muted him, and called a scammer. Told the scammer a similar story but gave the other guys name. Then said to both of them "ok here he is" and switched them onto each other. 

They introduced each other and then talked about "the account" for a couple minutes before one was like "why are asking me all this" then the other guy was like "you called me."
After a couple "nuh uh you"'s they fought and hung up.

 




 I found one. https://youtu.be/021GfNuhrRY 




 There was a prank caller on youtube that would do this. He would call a scammer or telemarketer and set them up by saying sonething like yea let me get the owner for you. Then transfer them to each other. 

I think tom mabe has done it and so has ownagepranks. I'll look up some videos in a sec.

 Isnt that the country that doesnt exist? 




 I always thought it was a a fake screen cap, I never knew there was a video and the troll went deeper.  




 I appreciate your appreciation 




 /r/catslaps for more cats being jerks 




 Bruh 




 just hire some undergrad English student to proofread.  

Yea at the minimum wage of whatever country that kid works in? 

And offering free stuff to do it or opening up the doors to anyone to edit it allows the possibility of vandalism. Think of wikipedia and how often it is vandalized. The power of wikipedia is that there are millions of users that quickly correct or revert things, usually within minutes or hours. What you are proposing doesnt have any checks in place. 

Imagine if reddit wrote a manual. We would add a bunch of inside jokes and easter eggs and trolls and how would the manufacturers know? They already suck at english as you said, so how would they know to correct vandalism.  




 The general idea is you bring in something valuable and they hold it for you to let you borrow money.  After some time you can come back and "buy" your thing back for what they borrowed plus some fee. Normally people want their shit back and pay. That is a self supporting business model if everyone came to get their shit back.

But when people dont get their shit back because they can't afford it or dont want it, then the shop will sell it. Usually at enough of a markup to regain the loan money, fees, and price of storage. Yea its not a lot of profit they make, but it is enough that there are so many pawn shops springing up. The other way is that the person will explicitly say they dont want it back, then the shop will buy it for less in an attempt to maximize potential profits. 

What you have to realize is that once they have a shop, storing one extra piece isnt all that much more cost. Once they are able to cover rent/mortgage costs, they can store as much as will fit in the shop without extra cost. 




 Documentation. Yea I know its necessary and sharing your ideas and work is super important and required and all, but its just so boring.  




 Prolly cuz she hasnt wiped in a month.  




 Mmm, cheese on hotdogs 




 And some of them are young... seriously, who likes old coke. 




 She seems like a jerk 




 Yea and when the dog finally gets to the bathroom he licks his owner clean.  




 the one I had in middle school only showed us pics of stds and said we would get that if we played with each other. 

You get the cunnilingus briefing in the highschool sex ed talk with megan under the bleachers at a football game.  




 But for a breif instant, one was capable of placing said cheese on the animal in question. The actions that the animal took did not deter from the act of placing cheese, only the amount of time the cheese remained after being successfully placed. Therefore we must invalidate your answer and it remains that "nothing" is the correct reply. 

Srly, cheese is good yo.  




 But, tits are always good. 




 Because jb's sensitivities got butthurt.  




 oh. I wasnt.  




 Yea thats slightly different too 




 You'll remember this once in a lifetime experience forever! 




 It was over the top horrible that it was actually ok. I think the first one was trying to go for that, they just never admitted it.

 Some say it made his hole weak, wait..

Wrong joke.  




 Yea yea, everyone sucks at driving but you, another sentiment reddit shares.  




 Thanks man, you too :) 




 Im not taking anything away from you, im just stating what our machine intellegence can reliably do at this point in time.  If you are so insecure you think any ol reddit comment is a personal attack on your driving ability then IDK what to tell you bud.  




 None. The human aspect messes it up. But being such a human thing, we need to make the best of it and try to change our governments for the good in the best ways we are able. 

Every form of government works with the right checks and controls, with the right people,  and in the right time. 

There is no "best" government, not because they are all bad, but because they are all good in the right circumstance. 

We can find perfect governments on paper that fail in real life and we can find terrible things on paper that work in real life. And of course, we can find anecdotes that support either cause. Socialism can work in real life the same way that capitalistic democracies can fail in real life. Humans are too unpredictable to choose a "best" government and so each instantiation of each form of government should be treated individually as its own case, not with these blanket statements. 

Theres a reason this is its own (large) field of study. It wouldnt be if it really could be summed up in a single reddit rant.  




 Is this ladybugging you?  




 Im covered in bees! 




 My motivation is to do better than my parents and make them proud of me. They are both immigrants and struggled to raise my sister and I. I want to take advantage of all the opportunities I have and all the work they have already done for me so that I can be in a position to help them when it comes time for that. I want to finish college and get a good job so that I can get things they never had and share with them. my motivition is to thank them wity more than words.  




 Just like reddit! 




 The movie Click 




 Dude BC ftw 




 I'm covered in bees!

 I have dabbled there. 




 Dat wiggle doe, still made my day.  









 Oh I see it now,  I'll try that next time.  




 But who was the first pic? 




 Not completely,  a lot of driving is predictable paths in good conditions. Rain and snow and unpredictability of other humans is what robots have trouble with, and that isnt all of driving.

 Dat asian lady cant make up her mind doe 




 Oh, I didnt know that.  




 Your body plays with legos. And it has a set of plans for legos called dna. Well, every now and then it will rebuild a part of you to keep you up to date. But sometimes it accidentally copies something wrong. Scientists call that a mutation. Sometimes that mutation will grow uncontrollably and do some nasty stuff like take resources fron the good cells. 

This does really bad things to your body. 

Thats the best eli5 I got and disclaimer that I am not a scientist.  




 Mmm, metroid larva.  

 




 What my sister and I did was we made fake notes and they had the other's phone number as the office's number. So when I would get a call, I would oretend to be Dr. Ramos's assistant and go through our records and then confirm that, yes, indeed /u/test_subject2027's sister was here yesterday.  




 Like I would tell you 




 We did it reddit, arrest him!

 The finger is over extending to lift the hotpocket. Plus, it takes you out of the game for a second. If we can add a small motor and have it automatically raise up when the hotpocket is too low, then this could revolutionize the world.  




 The turtle is a metaphor for cheating 









 They did high res 3d imaging so it really is exactly how they move 




 Yea the colour is shifted 




 The video said "the researchers captured the footage through high-resolution 3D time-lapse multi-colour imaging, making use of both spinning disk confocal microscopy and lattice light sheet microscopy. These techniques involves capturing slices through an object and stitching them together to provide final 3D images across the whole cell."

TLDR:  No
