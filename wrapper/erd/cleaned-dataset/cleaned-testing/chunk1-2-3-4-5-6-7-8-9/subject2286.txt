 Depends on how we would handle drug addiction as a health issue. If we handled it as a personal responsibly issue like cigarettes and alcohol, it would cost us a lot less, probably even generate income in tax revenue.

 Just pointing out that a little over half those suicides in the U.S. are also gun deaths, so saying that there are more suicides than gun deaths isn't exactly accurate. 




 A gun shot is thought to be the most common and effective way to commit suicide, and accounts for 53.7% of all suicides in the United States.

http://www.suicidemethods.net/suicide-methods/ 




 and yet in your past you did not have school shooting.

The earliest known U.S. school shooting was the Pontiac's Rebellion school massacre on July 26, 1764, where four men entered the schoolhouse near present-day Greencastle, Pennsylvania, shot and killed schoolmaster Enoch Brown, and killed nine or ten children (reports vary). Only three children survived.

 If your options are

a) Your child must quit school and work or they will not eat and will always be employed in a low paying job because they are uneducated and their children will also not go to school because they too must choose working over an education.

or

b) The community will pay for your child's food so that the child may remain in school, receiving an education which will allow them to make more money as an adult and not have to choose between having their children working or getting an education.

Would any parent say "No thank you, I would like my children to remain uneducated and poor"? 




  low illiteracy 

would mean that more people in those countries had received an education and could read, low *literacy* would mean fewer people could read. Is that what you meant? 




 Actually, the family is incentivized to produce educated children who will be more prosperous in adulthood and not need welfare, than children who work instead of becoming educated and will always be employed in low wage jobs.  




 Countries with low rates of literacy, have high rates of poverty. 




 Unless that family lives in in a county that provides public assistance, which was my point. 




 Compare [this map](http://www.glpinc.org/High_Literacy_Clusters/world_literacy_map_unhd_2007_2008.png), with [this one](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/Percentage_population_living_on_less_than_$2_per_day_2009.png).

Why would they if

If there is nothing to to gained, what's the point? 









 In the 12 months since the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., almost every state has enacted at least one new gun law, according to a database compiled by the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Nearly two-thirds of the new laws ease restrictions and expand the rights of gun owners. 

http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/12/10/us/state-gun-laws-enacted-in-the-year-since-newtown.html

If most of the new laws enacted were at the local level and "eased restrictions and expand the rights of gun owners" seems like NRA would have had more of a motive than the government. 




 My problem with this is motive, I don't see how the government gained anything in Sandy Hook. What right do you not have now, that you had just before Sandy Hook?

People who refuse to buy health insurance screw over the rest of us when they run up huge medical bills they can't pay by causing the hospitals to charge the rest of us higher prices to make up the difference which leaves insurers no choice but to raise our rates. I'll be glad to see them voluntarily paying higher taxes that they could have avoided by simply buying something that they needed to buy in the first place. They're no better than people who build their house in a floodplain and expect FEMA to bail them out every ten years.

 Saying that someone would be an excellent office holder if elected and saying that you endorse that candidate for that office is two different things.  




 I feel like we need another Truman or LBJ, so Hillary Clinton. 




 The threat of incarceration even though it's a non violent offence? 




 What President wouldn't say their former Secretary of State would be "excellent president"? It would be news worthy if he had said he didn't really think she was up to the job or something.   




 Would not paying the ticket count as a "nonviolent crime", would they get another ticket for that? 




 Nonpayment of child support is a victimless crime? 




 Ten lines in
"The government ought to leave non-violent offenders alone," said Paul. "If a guy is selling loose cigarettes and not paying the king's ransom in taxes, couldn't we give him a ticket instead of throwing him to the pavement?

Maybe you should read more than the first paragraph. This about more than drugs, he even mentions people being jailed for nonpayment of court ordered child support. 




 And selling untaxed cigarettes and not paying court costs and not paying student loans. 




 And what do we do if he doesn't pay the ticket worth billions? Write him one for trillions? That'll teach 'em. 




 "Even with child support, its a good example of how unintended consequences come about," Paul said.

Clearly he is talking about more than just drugs here. 




 Literally.  




 Look up Chain of Fools and Run Through the Jungle. 




 Y'all realize that the Banksters and corrupt politicians count as "non-violent offenders", right?

 You're paying your own way and not receiving a handout?  




 Several candidates are claiming that they'll dismantle Obamacare on day one if elected, for purely ideological reasons, despite the fact that it's lowering the deficit. I would call that relevant.

 Jeff Beck does use anything but his thumb. 




 

From the actual poll

For each of the following pairs of statements, tell me which one
better describes your perfect candidate, even if neither is exactly right. 

The candidate shares your views on all major issues 51%

The candidate may not share all of your views on major issues, but
belongs to the party you prefer and has a good chance of winning 47%

No opinion 3%  




 And there we have it Ladies and Gentlemen, proof that the GOP really is racist. 









 Thus whites aren't at any significant threat from blacks who mostly live in different neighbourhoods and mostly self victimize one another?  

Which raises the question, why do you care what the percentage of crimes committed by blacks are, if it's mostly black on black crime?

Are you a black Democrat?   




 Betteridge's law of headlines is an adage that states: "Any headline that ends in a question mark can be answered by the word no."

Will they just refuse to vote on judicial nominees until the voters give in and vote the way the GOP wants them to? 




 The CNN/ORC poll found that about 46 percent of Americans view Clinton favorably while 50 percent view her unfavorably. While 50% maybe more than 46%, it's still only half, not most. 









 I second this motion, don't underestimate the kid. 




 But, the fact that they were going to be "coronated" was proof that the system was broken. Does this mean the system isn't broken?  




 We never had poll questions like this till Nixon. No Pollsters ever asked anyone if they trusted LBJ or Goldwater. Just which one would do the better job or which one shares your beliefs.

 Like Duggars and Hastert? 




 Well she couldn't possibly be qualified to be President if her husband wanted her to look at his penis, could she?  




 At the end of the day, you're still putting stock in the opinions of a Penthouse centerfold as to the quantifications of a Presidential candidate. Did they ask any other Penthouse centerfolds their opinion of Clinton? Did they ask this Penthouse centerfold her opinion of any other candidates besides Clinton?    




 In a world where no one cohabitated this would work, but a world in which on one raises children or lives with the elderly or infirmed, isn't a sustainable world. 














 Has there ever been a problem for which the solution **wasn't** more U.S. troops on the ground as far as McCain is concerned? 



















 At this point Senators Santorum and Graham and Gov. Jindal would be out and Donald Trump and Ben Carson would be in. 









 Mine did. 









 If that's a fact, then you shouldn't have any problem providing a little proof? 














 Could you please name just one action that could be taken by Zimmerman or by anyone else, for or against him, that would increase or decrease the amount of rights you currently enjoy as a citizen?    




 How is the Zimmerman story political? He'll never hold elected office and nothing he does and nothing that might be done to him will result in a rewrite of the constitution or set a new legal precedent.   














 I always thought it was sad that OTR died out just before FM broadcasting, transistor radios and multi-track recording came along. I say why tie one hand behind your back. We don't ask Hollywood to make B W silent movies. 




 Randy

I like this, let's continue doing this. 




 This is like saying you left your children $300,000 in debt because you left them a mortgaged house with 3 $600 payments left. 




 when a president of either party asks, you say yes. 




 If the media treats a candidate like they're relevant, it's because they're a threat, but if the media treats them like they aren't relevant, it's because they are a treat.  




 I get that, I just don't think that a pedophile is going to stop molesting kids because they have contracted an STD and the penalty has increased. I also don't think child molestation should've ever been just a class 3 felony in the first place.   




 I'm guessing this works on the assumption that someone who's willing to molest a kid is willing to do 3 years for it, but wouldn't do it if it was 10? 




 Right now there are [U.S. soldiers in Japan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Forces_Japan) who weren't even born when Pearl Harbor occurred. 




 And still got mo' money than you. 




 Well one of them is still going to be elected whether you're impressed or not. 














 Secretary of State is a lot more important that Vice President, unless the President dies. 




 I say it time we consider putting something other than  people on our money. 





























 Does he even have a cat? 














 A more accurate headline would have been 

Court Rules Cellphone Tower Data Belongs to Your Phone Carrier, Not You 









 Do you believe that anyone fit for jury duty is also fit to be President of the U.S.? 




 Hell Nixon would be today. 




 Yeah, they're treated as bad as Gays are in Russia! 









 Why is politics the one profession that people feel an absolute novice should be able to start at the top of the field?   




 Did you notice that the story was about Carly Fiorina, who seems to be incapable of either? 









 First time I heard this song was in the late sixties on a Roger Miller album, can't remember the name of it, cover was of him sitting in a porch swing with an acoustic guitar, for a while I thought he had written it. 




 How long will every fourth headline in /r/politics have "Carson" in it, even in links like this one, that isn't even really about him? 




 While details about the gunmen, including their religion or their motive, weren't immediately known,

How do we know that this wasn't just a personal vendetta and has nothing to do with Islam and Free Speech? 




 A rehearsal where the protesters got what they wanted, the government wasn't able to control the information coming out? Sounds like a bad rehearsal.  




 No one has identified any of the shooters as Muslims. They know who did it, they shot and killed them. Is it possible that they weren't Muslims?  









 [Rated Mostly True by Politifact](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/apr/19/bernie-s/bernie-sanders-says-99-percent-new-income-going-to/). 




 Did he declare marshall law to stop 'em declarin' marshall law? 




 And Fox News backs warmongering, racist, homophobes 100% of the time. 




 Harvard University is a private Ivy League research university in Cambridge, Massachusetts, established in 1636.  




 Jeffrey Dahmer was murdered in prison, should that have been factored in when considering whether to bring charges against him? 




 Don't know, ask Reuters, it's was there headline before they changed it. 




 Maybe they will come out during the trial? 




 Not by compromise. That's the whole point of Sanders. 




 And yet you assume that this officer wasn't driving at a high rate of speed and his prisoner sustained serious bodily harm while he drove slowly and carefully? 




 According to conventional wisdom on r/politics, everyone except African Americans who voted for Obama, now regret that decision and wouldn't vote for Clinton either and will stay home and vote for none of the above unless Rand Paul gets the GOP nomination. So if Reddit is any indicator, it should be a cakewalk for Sanders. 




 I never used the term "High speed". Are your are trying to incite people to lynch me? 




  shit birt?

 




 They'll still get their day in court and the best lawyers their gofundme campaign can buy. 




 And without casino owners or super PACs. 




 This has been covered in this thread already and addressed by the mods, OP posted the original headline just as Reuters had ran it, then Reuters changed their headline on the article.   




 A "lynch mob" is when you aren't given your day in court because someone kills you before that can happen, much like what happened to Freddie Gray. 




 No, he needs to keep being Bernie. 









 After having clicked the link, I'm thinking more like Pam Grier.  














 [List of charges for 6 officers in Freddie Gray's death](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/05/01/baltimore-police-charges-freddie-gray/26701383/) 









 Yes. The rest are being charged with like negligent homicide or something.  




 When a defendant commits an act even though he knows his act runs an unusually high risk of causing death or serious bodily harm to someone else. Like doing doughnuts in a paddy wagon with a shacked, but unseatbelted, detainee in the back. 




 As the mods have already pointed out in this thread, OP posted Reuters original headline   then Reuters changed their headline.  




 Shaft?

 Or he could choose option B, win spending less money.  














 Thank you. 




  prosecutor

noun

a person, especially a public official, who institutes legal proceedings against someone.

nothing gets to court unless someone is charged. 




 So maybe some white people should go down to city hall and protest against them being charged? 




 I wonder if white protesters will show up to protest against them being charged? 














 But we had all those veterans fresh from the SpanishAmerican War (1898) and the PhilippineAmerican War (18991902). 




 That's like saying only those with blood on their hands can stop the violence.  









  make America safe again.

When was that, when was America safer than it is now? 




 When a pot calls a kettle black, it's still true. 




 Will Cruz be a unifying force? Will he be able to explain to African Americans why there is a perfectly good reason they're more than twice as likely to be shot in the back or put in a choke hold by a police officer while unarmed for selling untaxed cigarettes or driving with a broken tail light, than white americans are? 




 Funny how this was basically the norm for the first half of the twentieth century.  




 Check out the guy's channel on Youtube, he's got The Shadow too. 




 Looks like the one on the Atlanta Highway in Montgomery Alabama, before it was remodeled. 









 Look, y'all gonna have to find a narrative and stick to it, Obama can't be a Cheese Eating Surrender Monkey one week and a warmonger the next.   




 That's like saying that since freeing black slaves would hurt the job prospects of Irish day laborers, we shouldn't free the slaves. 




 If someone works hard, will they be guaranteed financial success?

Is religious belief necessary to live an ethical and moral life?      

If your neighbor physically assaults their SO, is that any of your business?     




 Pretty sure whoever the next President is, the White House Correspondents Dinner won't be as much fun as it was under Obama and Bush. 




 And pointing out his ethnicity and/or his religious beliefs is the best way to communicate his political beliefs? Like, if he was Afro-American, you would point that out to show that he is a democrat? Or if he was LDS, you would point to that as proof that he supports polygamous marriage? 

   I have no doubt of Adelson's support of right wing Israeli foreign policy, but Perry and Cruz prove that one need not be Jewish to hold such opinions and I'm pretty sure simply being Jewish doesn't automatically make one hold those opinions.    




 Why is it always necessary to note that Adelson is Jewish? If Barbra Streisand donated money to the Clinton campaign, would the headline be "Hillary Appeals to Jewish Donors"? 




 http://www.ontheissues.org/senate/hillary_clinton.htm 














 Unless you wanted to have sex with her, what difference does it make? 




 Bush plead guilty to DUI. His daughters were caught trying to buy beer using fake ID's. 1963 Laura Bush ran a stop sign in the Texas and killed a guy. Bush was not only nominated, but was elected and reelected. This means nothing. 




 Just ask Rush if he thinks you're hot. 




 Well there you go kids, you no longer have to face the prospect of having to hold your nose and choose between Jeb or Hillary. You can vote Waka! 




 Can confirm, haven't heard any of them proclaim that they're the only one who can defeat Martin O'Malley.  




 So is singing Uptown Funk. 




 So would they make them a wedding cake as long as they agreed to never adopt any orphans?  




 But do the hetrosexuals that don't support homosexuallity, support the homosexuals that don't support homosexual parenting? 




 Considering that a large number of right-winger who wouldn't find this unconstitutional, would never go to HuffPo for fear of having their information bubble burst, I would say it is.   




 Like Adam Walsh and Etan Patz? 




 But now with cloud storage.... 




 You realize this means labor union bosses pay more income taxes than right-wing radio personalities? 




 Actually, there's very rarely black only events. Outside of "Miss Black America", I can't name any. 




 Anything found

 through the ramblings of Jean Shepherd.


is gonna be good.
 




 This is one of those show like Easy Aces, that mostly only appreciated by those who are smart enough to know when to laugh without being told.  




 Overall a good job and a good idea. You really do have a good voice for the medium. You should look in to an audio editor, like Audacity. It's free and easy to use and would allow you to record your show without the music and then add it in after to improve the audio quality. 




 So, your telling me that rich, bootstrapy job creators don't move to red states and cities with less taxes and less regulations? 




 So, if I go to Texas, I can open carry firearms in the House of Representatives?  




 Remember when /r/politics was crying that Obama was back peddling on his promise to get us out of Iraq?

RingoPendragon remembers. 




 I'm sure an endorsement from the former host of "The Man Show" will help Cruz with both Evangelical and women voters. 




 Complaining about the quality of a free public school lunch is like complaining about size of your apartment in in the government run housing project, isn't it?
