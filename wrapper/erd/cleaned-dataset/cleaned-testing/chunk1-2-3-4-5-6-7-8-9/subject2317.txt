 Lovin' the "TE-DDY!" Chants at TCF. Skol! 




 What each person thinks their spirit animal is. It's a light hearted way to learn about each other's personality. 




 I'm studying to be a PA as well. 6 months in, just passed Pharmacology. Great answer! Our faculty always scoffs at self diagnosis, but I had a buddy who saved his life by researching on line. I feel the patient knows their body better then I do, so it is definitely worth a listen. 




 Yup. 3 years, 4,000 comment karma, 2,000 link karma. Had to get rid of it because my username was not appropriate. 
























 Hey all, anyone know of a good simulator to practice with? Something that has a patient presentation and you need to gather history, perform an exam, give meds and the simulation will respond accordingly? 




 Sorry to butt in, but this is obvious.  




 Subtle. I like it.

 Haha, that was what I was hoping for. It would be a warning sign to anyone who knew some anatomy that it was all bull. 




 Sports medicine professional here. Emesis in football is actually more common then you think, but not at the professional level. Do you see the way his head jerks slightly right before emesis? It almost looks like a double take. This is known as the "Callaway" sign, it signifies emesis is likely about to occur. The anatomy goes like this: due to the strange squatting position and repeated supination and flexion of the dominant arm, the esophagus is repeatedly retracted into the fundal gastric region. This stimulates baroreceptrors in the pouch of douglas. Sort of like how tickling makes you laugh, it is completely idiological. But the reason this occurs to pros less often is they don't pull your leg. Sorry. All BS. Not a professional, I just know fancy words. 
























 Samesies with you guys. Bears are my least favorite, because Cutler.

 Thanks for the reply. Wow that is an awful, terrible rule. I feel bad for the Packers. What is the reasoning behind that? 




 No stream access, what was the play and rule that ruled it a safety?

 Did they run that double move for this throw? 




 Honestly if you told me before hand the game was going to be this close I would have been ok with it. Obviously I wanted a win, screw off everyone who wanted the vikes to lose. You aren't true Viking fans. Teddy made some rookie mistakes, but wasn't awful. Running game never found rhythm. Defense looked great until they ran out of steam. 

It was a fun game to watch, Skol Vikings. 


































 Ah yes, the [ol luggage a roo!](http://www.reddit.com/r/bigdickproblems/comments/2rubmg/guy_claiming_125_inches_does_an_ama/cnklb6r?context=2) 




 Reddit has changed. The top comment of an article was almost always the counter argument to the link. This would allow the reader to get a full perspective on the topic. Now it is usually occupied with circle jerking reinforcement (i.e, all the anti-Muslim posts over the last 36 hours).

I am not taking either side on this issue, I am just disappointed I had to scroll this far down for a counter argument.

Inb4 "le noob month old reddit account talks about the good ol days hue hue hue", I deleted my old account because it had an offensive connotation.

I read it on a bathroom stall once 




 "16 other discussions" well reposting this turned into a thing 




 /u/DMRage, It seems you have found yourself in the Vikings Bridgewater circlejerk! Welcome my friend! Here we believe... no... we know Teddy will be the greatest Viking since Leif Erikson (hinga dinga durrrga). All posts denying our bridge over troubled water will be mercilessly down voted by delirious Vikings fans who have nothing to do but root against the Packers, and scan all forums for talks of how great Teddy is. So grab a Grainbelt, serve yourself some luttefisk, and get ready to put what little hope you have for football enjoyment into the T man himself. Because we just can't take another dissapointment.

 Hahahaha, this happened to me! Also I had a hot ultra sound nurse examine me... That was awkward. 




 Also going to go ahead and call some troll will respond to every out-of-sub reference with /r/FeelsLikeTheVeryFirstTime 




 I always knew it as just 'telephone'. Is that irony? 




 Not sure why you are being down voted, Mallory Weis tears are a probable diagnosis. Although I think they occur with more severe initial vomiting such as alcoholism.

 No recess reference here? Dang. This is obviously swing kid all grown up. 




 I'm sorry to hear that. That sounds excruciatingly painful. Was it an LFT? That is a common liver test that can be indicative of gallbladder problems. Have they talked about having the dumb thing removed? 




 Meh, been better. I did well on my test this week (I'm in grad school), and got to go climbing tonight. But I was blind sided-ly broken up with by a girl I'd been seeing for 3 weeks. Things were going great until she went on a double date as a favor for a friend and decided to date the other guy instead :( Sorry to hear about the gallbladder attack, may I ask what is wrong? I am in the medical field and am naturally curious about this stuff.
