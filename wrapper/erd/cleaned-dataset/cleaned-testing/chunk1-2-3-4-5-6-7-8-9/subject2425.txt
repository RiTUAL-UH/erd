 If he's gaming, he won't see the 30$ difference in the 6000 series.  It performs about 3% better in games than the 4300.  Also,  in response to not witty, the gtx 760 is nearly equivalent to a gtx 670. Your CPU is probably bottle necking your 760 slightly, but it's nothing that would be noticeable and I wouldn't go buy a new CPU over it. 




 Pcpartpicker.com is probably the site.

My general rule is:
CPU: if your using a gtx 760 or above go intel (4670k or 4770k are great CPUs)

If you go with a budget CPU anything up to a 660ti, go with the amd phnom ii x4 965 be or fx 4000 series.

Gpu:  if you are going to do 3 1080p monitors or go with one 1440p monitors, go with 2 gtx 760s in sli. If you are using one 1080p monitor, something from amd should suffice.

The gtx 760 has the best price/performance ratio at the moment and you can sli 3 of them. They also have a very high frame buffer so you won't notice microstuttering much. 2 gtx 760's in sli perform better than a gtx Titan for 500$ less.

Storage: Samsung 840 pro series for ssd.  Western digital caviar black for hdd.  I personally go for raid 0 hard drives over one ssd, so I have storage (2tb vs 128gb-256gb) and some speed to go along with it. 

Monitors: yamakasi cat leap. Find it on eBay, best value for a 120hz monitor.

If you need more help, go to the forums on pcpartpicker and go to partlistopinions wanted. I'm a regular on that sub forum and a lot of other people would be glad to help you :)!

 Yes, there are hardly any IDE interface ssd's and at that, it does not utilize the full speed of an ssd. You will have to buy another sata3 cable. 




 Just search on google for windows 8.1 ISO. You can download it straight from the Microsoft website and load the ISO file into bootcamp. This is good until January. 




 Windows 8.1 is free right now. 




 As an AT T customer, i get a constant 20mbps down speed on my uverse line. Also with wireless, i enjoy having the ability to use data while talking on the phone simultaneously. Something other carriers can not provide. (try to call somebody and then go to google if you are on verizon and make sure your wifi is off).  I live almost right under an at t tower and get 35-40mbps lte data :). 




 Belmont? 




 You can say all you want but it is inconsiderate of people around you that have to get up and go to work in the morning with less than 5 hours of sleep. The mother and the person that used ignorant words like "fuck and hell" in his story length paragraph is unacceptable. If you have a child with mental disabilities, you should think about people around you. 




 It's called boot camp. And you get windows 8.1 for free until January.

 The pentium being a dual core, yes it would put a good limit on the 760s capabilities. I would go with at least a 3220 (it's a dual core with hyperthreading) if you are on a tight budget. 
























 Stuff like that takes a crazy amount of time to render on consumer class desktops.  




 Pickles are cucumbers. I found this out 2 years ago. 




 Is it me, or does it seem like gaming companies are taking advantage of reddit for cheap advertising? 




 Am I the only one that is amazed at how well he said that guys name at the beginning of the video?

I have yet to get a response. 




 Hey reddit, i have just started trying to learn after effects. I downloaded a template on youtube and played around with it for fun. But my question is, how can i get the rain to continue through the whole video? It cuts off when the text appears. Thanks for the help, it really means a lot to me as a beginner.

 Yeah, definitely go with the 7770ghz. Go to pcpartpicker.com and filter the gpu selection out and it will find you the lowest price. 




 What is your budget? The best value for a gpu right now is the gtx 760 for the 200-300 dollar price range(if you SLI 2 of them together, it is a great deal more powerful than the 780.). If you want something sub 100 dollar range, get the 7770 ghz edition. The ghz edition ironically goes for less most of the time than the regular 7770. If you aren't looking for cuda cores for programs that will utilize them (adobe after effects, photoshop, fireworks, etc.) or are wanting to sli 2 or more gpus together then go amd. The 7770ghz pulls about 60 fps on high on battlefield 3 with buffs like anti-aliasing turned down. Hope i helped you out. 





























 What happened to the mega box project Kim said would be out Q2 this year? I was really interested in that music service and I really wish they would have released it.

 Yeah it's bold and it's good. Att next and other pay monthly per device plans are actually a good thing that has been implemented. They are a good deal. Websites say it isn't because they are factoring in your monthly bill for service and data, but you can not count that because you would be paying that any way.  




 As a samsung fan, I feel disgusted. First it was the fake benchmark scores (geekbench being one of them) and now fake web comments. I know all companies do it a little but for samsung to be caught in the act, means they were doing a lot more than their share. Samsung makes a much more powerful phone than anybody else, but where is the backbone?

 Michael from vSauce, is that you? 




 It might not sound like much to you, but instead think about 999,999 playstation 4's.  




 I just wish they still had the service for $7.99 a month. 




 There is actually a way. It is very simple now because apple removed DRM from all of their songs about 2 years ago. All you have to do now is plug in your android to the computer, find where your itunes songs are stored on your computer (if they arent downloaded, download them first) and just click and drag to the music file of your android device. Album art and metadata comes with each file as well. 




 How do the cars park/drive off (second picture)? 




 That FPS Master controller, it actually seems like it would help. 




 I am learning this program by myself. But i have a question. [Here is the image im trying to reproduce in cad](http://i458.photobucket.com/albums/qq304/gwidas2000/steeringbush1kk9.jpg)

I made the 54 line, but how do i make the 36 line perfectly centered in between the 54 line?
I'm going to add the circles later after i get the lines made. Thanks.

Edit: you don't have to be in a university to use this, it also works for k-12. The only downside is that it expires in 3 years.
studica.com sells perpetual licenses (they never expire) for design suite and entertainment suite ($22,000 combined) for $500. 
























 I guess i'm the only one that actually uses and likes airdrop. 









 [Douchebag gallantly bursts through blaring his garbage music.](http://youtu.be/BrUhRa_QBHI?t=5m32s) 




 I'd actually think about keeping the processor and just going with a 780. No single card solution past  780 should bottleneck the 8320.  




 The last one should be wing dings. 




 Funny how this guy is trying to scam walmart. iPad mini ( non-retina edition) retails for 299.99. This guy has an iPad mini retina box, but iPad mini with the retina displays retail for 399.99. If you look at the front of the box, if the iPad mini has iOS 7 icons it is a retina version. If it has iOS 6 icons, it is the regular iPad mini. What a low down scum. 




 Whenever i rarely change the tv to the military channel, there is always a 6-7 year old top 10 tanks countdown on for about 3-4 hours.

 I heard about a tweak the first week of the iOS 7 jailbreak on r/jailbreak that enabled everything going to the a5 processor on the iPhone 5s to be routed to the m5 processor instead. This in turn is supposed to make the phone a little bit laggy, but give amazing battery life. About two weeks later, somebody asked the same question as i am asking here, but it went undiscussed. Does anybody know anything about it?

 Legion Commander! Nice loops, do you use cinema 4d to do this? Doesn't that require some pretty powerful hardware?

 Multiple people at my school have iPhones and it is nice to be able to share a gif or photo/link without having to know their contact/number. I use it a ton. 




 The fingerprint scanner has never worked for me, I've always looked at it as a gimmick. But apparently, it works for 98% of the people at my school and on /r/jailbreak. The only way I'm using it now is with the new touch home app. It sends you to the home screen or multitasking switcher by just placing(not pushing) your finger on the home button, no touch id required.  
























 I bent the ones on my z97n wifi motherboard by putting the usb 3.0 header from my case in the wrong way. It will bend the pins so bad if you dont line it up because there is a blocked off pin on the cable to "prevent" it from going in. I tried a straw and it was a bit to big, so i used the mini straw off of some canned air and carefully bent the pins back. Luckily, they work perfect now. 




 Go check out the Dell inspiron 15 non touch. They are on sale on the dell website for $249 which is the cheapest laptop i have seen in a while (besides a chromebook). 




 Most of the people I have talked to that wanted to go into the game industry (quite a few) changed their mind very quickly. Just because you like to play games does not mean you will like to make them. That field is a big money maker for the small "ITT Tech" schools and they know that. So many people want to go into game design that you have to be the cream of the crop when it comes around to getting a job, or you have to hit it big as an indie developer. If I were you I would seriously reconsider your job path.  




 There is on gas station that has it for $3.17 here in South Carolina. I live in North Carolina, but i am so close to the border (gastonia) that its cheaper to just drive to South Carolina to fill up. 




 Your CPU is running a bit hot, even on idle. I would clean the CPU with isopropyl alcohol and reapply a good thermal paste like arctic silver. 

That should be the cause of the temps, or either your CPU cooler is not making good contact with the CPU.  




 We have the next best where I live, and that is Cookout. Cookout milkshakes are so good, it makes the milkshake in that picture look like a garbage Wendy's frosty. 




 I think the gpu they decided to use is underpowered for an almost 4k resolution display. Even a single gtx 780ti/titan black has trouble playing games at 4k, which is what this computer is marketed as. Laptop gpus are much weaker than their desktop counterparts.  The only game that i see running at 4k maxed out on this laptop are source engine games and various others. (counter strike, dota 2, team fortress 2, etc.) 




 Exactly, you hit the nail on the head. I have built "gaming" computers, but when I tried my first macbook pro with retina display, the OS just sold me. That influenced me to build my hackintosh, and it was the best decision i ever made.  
























 Im using the 960 just for premiere pro at a resolution of 2560x1600. I have gamed with it before, and it does run games like dota 2 and league maxed out at around 45-60 fps maxed out at native resolution. Triple AAA titles, not so much. Battlefield 4 is really only playable at 1600p at low/medium settings. 

tl;dr: 1080p gaming: 960 would run all games (with a few exceptions) at ultra settings 
         1440p or higher: 970 (would run all games at 1080p on maxed out settings easily). Turn down some of the graphics settings if you are playing at 1440p.


 




 plug the battery back in after doing so (if you didn't). unplug the machine, and hold the power button on the case for 15 seconds. Plug it back in and turn the machine on.  




 Try to find the BIOS battery and disconnect it. This will reset the BIOS settings (that battery still has power even after the power being off for a year). 




 I love them, my type of shoes. I really like the small logo on these type of shoes, [Just like these](http://www.endclothing.com/brands/new-balance-pre-orders/new-balance-m1500sb-made-in-england-m1500sb.html) 




 This has been happening to me too, couldn't find anything on google so I gave up on it. 




 There is a difference between recording 4k video, and recording quality 4k video. Check [Blackmagic Design Camera's](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/cinemacameras)

 




 Reddit users jump all over things like this, but in actuality comcast has all the power to fine this person. He most likely moved while he was in contract for tv and internet and they served him the fee to finish out his contract. 




 You can build a piratebox! It is basically your own personal cloud that requires no internet service to connect to. It uses a wireless router that emits a wireless signal (~$70), a storage medium (usually a flash drive around 16-128gbs) and a rechargeable battery. Once you have it all set up and flashed the bios, you can set it up with or without a password for people to connect to. When you turn it on, it should emit a wireless signal that most devices can connect to (the same way you connect to a wifi signal) and upload or download files that are stored on the hard drive. It is definitely a nice addition if you want to start a little intranet at your school for people to get answers to homework, or listen to that new song everyone has been talking about it and it happened to be uploaded by somebody around the premises. 

edit: Also, there is no app the devices have to download to upload or download files. You go to the internet browser on the device and the page that is pushed out by the piratebox automatically loads so it is web based. No downloading required. [Here is more information on what a piratebox is and what it does in more detail](http://lifehacker.com/5746102/build-a-pirate-box-for-mobile-and-secure-file-sharing)
