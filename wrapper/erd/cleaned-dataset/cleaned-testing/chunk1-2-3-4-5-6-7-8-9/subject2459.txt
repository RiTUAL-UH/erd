 Ok well the common answer is free will...

Ok I'm not gid (surprise!) So that is a great question since he would be right there unless of course the answer is free will. 




 Okaay... 




 Ha, ha I can imagine what that would be like :) 




 Ok. I'll pretend to be god...

Because if everything was perfect then no one would be human. Our experiences make us so and we must get into heaven, if everyone was perfect no one would be human. 




 Ok it's a bit rude but too each his own. 









 I'm not God (obviously... stop starring at me, I mean it!) I'm sure you will :) 




 Oh and I hope you enjoy the rest of your time in the navy and good luck at med school :) 




 Well since I was young I've wanted to be a doctor but I've also always loved history and just recently I've been inspired and I want to persue that or medicine. 




 Aaw that's nice. I like that more than anything I've seen so far. Just the reassurance :) 




 Sad, the cancer not your question. 




 Maybe, why don't you try and see, you never know... 




 Ha, ha good luck at med school (that's what I plan on doing, well either that or archaeology. It's always been medicine but now I'm questioning that). 




 Okaay... 




 Interesting :) 




 Okay I'll pretend to be god in two scenarios and answer with what you'd say:

1. You go to heaven, if you're good and hell if you're bad, in heaven you can get what ever you want whenever you want. See dead relative's and friends and live in eternal peace.

2. You do essentially just rot but you still have an overwhelming feeling of peace. 

What do you do? 




 Ha, ha sorry about that :D 




 Yup, I mean it would be nice but I guess that's just the way it is we could try and change it, people have but I don't think people can go without having conflict. 




 Ha, ha I can guarentee if you ask that to God you'll have sex with God :D unless he said maybe. 




 7, 4, 17, 32, 34, 27 




 Just joking I know what you meant :) 




 ?? (Sex talk time :) ) 




 Ha, ha inney? 




 That would be nice but I doubt that we will ever see it happen. 




 Aaah, well lets just say he is tired and wants you to simply ask him :) 




 Ha, ha what would *you* do? 




 Well with every answer comes more questions so it'd be nice to know so we can search for more answers. 




 I think he'd say something like "me"... I think 




 I wonder what he'd say 




 Lets just say you won a raffle and he wants you to ask him :) 




 Ha, ha, simple :s 




 Ha, ha! :D 




 I'd like to know that too :) 




 Ha, ha "still under development" 




 Ha, ha :) 




 Why? Nice, I guess it would be cool to hear the answer :) 




 I would love to know that too :D 




 Lots of people could *probably* answer that but God would answer it better, obviously :) 




 Cool question? 




 Wow guys! You have all asked some really awesome stuff! Keep 'em coming and I will talk to you guys and maybe answer (even though I'm not God, I mean it stop starring... I'm not!) :D 




 I see what you mean. Well I guess others would feel, shocked? 




 Also I just did a quick google search and tons of results came up from last week to last year to 2012, this has been posted a million times. 




 Okay but it **was** on the front page just the other day. 




 Don't get me wrong I love science, I'm acing biology and chemistry and I don't force my beliefs on anyone but I do have a religion: I'm catholic. 




 Actually they did it made the front page not too long ago. 




 Well religious people (like myself) would have reinforced beliefs and others would feel stupid for not believing. I think it would  be simmilar and maybe stop all the stupid internet arguments. 




 Man bear pig, South park! :D 




 This is a repost!  




 No I love dogs and everything to do with them :) 




 Good luck! Here's what I do:

I answer most questions with yes or no. Am I going to get my work done now instead of procrastinating? Yes. Am I going to fap? No. Am I...? Yes/no.

I'm also doing it to have a better outlook on life and change my views about certain things and for religious reasons. Good luck! :D 




 http://www.yourbrainonporn.com 




 You numb your dopamine receptors and it makes sex with real people less pleasureable and fun things in general but only with excessive masturbating. You **CAN** become dependent. It can lower self esteem and make you lazier (and more but this doesn't happen to everyone, like me I chose to stop for personal and religious reasons). 




 Slugs! (Or snails) 




 South park! :D 




 Cause it's easier to sing like that and sounds nice but many still sing in their home accents. 




 Hey good luck and meditation helps a lot! :) Oh by the way I think you should reset your badge.

Anyway don't think of this as bad it's actually great now you can learn from it. :) 




 Hi, I'm 15 so I obviously haven't had sex yet and I don't want to... well not yet, not for at least another 3-5 years and I would only do it with a girl I really care about. Anyway I want to know if there's anyway to get rid of sexual frustration? Since some of you have sex you don't need to worry about it but what kind of things could I do. (Oh and side note, don't know if it's important, I was never addicted to pmo but I wanted to stop anyway for a few reasons). 









 So I'm fifteen years old, I tried nofap a while back for a few reasons. Religion (I'm catholic), for myself, I wanted a better out look on things and to change my view. PMO made me feel like women all fake orgasms and that they're whores (if they're in porn) I shouldn't have judged them. 

I made it to four days last time and decided I would fap, I've never been addicted to it, because I said if I balance it, it's healthy and I don't need porn I can use my mind. All was going well but then I thought ok one porno isn't so bad so I watched some cartoon porn, I was watching it around 3 times a week then I went back to real porn. That's when I said no! No more. I'm gonna do nofap and I'm going to do it right this time. Tomorrow I go from a smiley face to a number 1. It isn't much but it's a big step for me. I've thought, over the last week, you're still early in just do it once, no big deal but straight away I said no. It'll be nice then but what about after? So I always said no and focused on something else. 

I read a post that said always say yes or no for things you're unsure about. Not maybe, not if this happens then, just yes or no. And so far no has been great here and yes has been great in other parts of my life. I know it's early and I have no huge results yet but I can do this and so can you. Good luck. 




 Thanks guys all of you seem to think it's fun with a friend, I'll pick it up :) 




 Hi I'm Devlin, I'm 15 years old and I'm from Scotland. AMA!

***Short Bio***

 I live in a city called Glasgow and I'm going through high school. I play a lot of xbox and I love to read, be it books, comic-books or short stories. My favourite genre is Science-Fiction but I'm open to read any genre. I love to write and I spend a lot of time studying. 

***Update***

 thanks for all of the questions guys/girls! Keep asking and I'll keep answering. I think I should answer this since a lot of you have asked if I like haggis. I've never tried it, I know that's strange but I do love other scottish foods and drinks like lorne sausage, shortbread, tablet, porridge (with milk and sugar) and of course irn bru (I'm drinking some now). :)

Oh and if any of you want any proof just ask and I can link my facebook :) 



















 **EDIT** It now shows me the percentage, it's been around half an hour and it's only at 3 % help! 




 Well I started nofap as an experiment, of sorts. Now I never went long like some of you have and that's fine with me. This is because 

 I was never addicted to porn 

and 

 I learned what I wanted from this.

What did I learn? That nofap is not for me, however, I'm not just going to go and watch a ton of porn but what I am going to do is moderate what I'm doing. I used to fap at least once-twice a day, I would occasionally miss one but I digress. Anyway now I'm going to only do it once-twice a week and maybe miss it every now and then. I think this is perfectly healthy, I won't be consumed by fapping,I'll have more time to spend on other things and I don't have to fight urges like I did these past few days. 

I do owe thanks to nofap because now I know what I want to do. Thank you all.

Who knows, I might want to try nofap again someday bt for now goodbye and thanks :) 




 **EDIT 1** Thanks every one for answering, don't worry I won't be expecting the stuff from porn in real life and I probably won't even use it but if fapping starts to have any kind of negative on me I will stop and come back here also I will only be doing it once, maybe twice, a week. 




 Hi, I'm relatively new here and I haven't relapsed since I started, actually it's been pretty easy. Now, however, all day I've been getting urges. I've been able to put them to bed but now it's just... It's getting to difficult. Even when I get rid of one boner another one isn't far away, and it's not like I'm thinking about or watching porn. I don't want to start again,I know if I make it through the first week I can keep going and I know I'll be disappointed if I fail, HELP! 




 Okay so I want to make it to ninety days and see where it goes from there. I heard the early parts are the hardest, no pun intended, and these first few days have been easy. I've kept my mind busy and when I've thought about fapping I just say no, I don't want to and I focus on something else but today I've had more boners than any other and I thought to myself it's fine because I'm only a few days in but I forced myself not to.

Do any of you have any tips on how I can stop urges when they arise? 









 I was playing games when I was 3 and first completed a game, gta vice city, when I was 4. I completed the  story in a few days and got 100% within a week or two. Then I went back and did all of the previous gtas before continuing on to tomb raider and halo etc 









 I know it's a bit unrealistic but anything can be done. I've been reading up on some tips. Do any of you have any that might help? 














 I just started here and went to add a badge, I thought you mailed them your birthday so I, apparently, haven't fapped since '99 :D 









 Hey, so I recently started meditating and I asked someone (who had been doing it for nine years) if I was doing it right and when I explained what it was like they said that it sounded like I got pretty close to jhana. He then said that that usually takes years for people to achieve. So I did some light reading on it but I don't fully understand it can someone who knows what it is or has experienced it explain it to me please.

**here is what I did the first time**

http://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/2ssn39/am_i_meditating_properly/ 




 Hi. I recently started meditating which is making me feel great and I've known about lucid dreaming for a long time. I hear the best way to have them is to train yourself by you know doing something like trying to put your finger through the palm of your hand or holding your nose and still breathing but I've never been able to stick with them. You know getting into the routine of doing them naturally.

I have a few questions...

* is this right? Training yourself?

* if I do do this how long, roughly, should it take before I can lucid dream

* I hear before you can lucid dream you get sleep paralysis and must go straight back to sleep. Is this true?

* does the sleep paralysis happen to everyone?

Answering any of these is greatly appreciated. Thanks. 




 Hi everyone. First off I don't and never have smoked pot but my older brother does. To be honest I can't stand the smell of it and I'm against drugs in general even ones that don't do harm like pot. 

Anyway you all probably know that in school you're told 

"People do drugs to get high... drugs are bad"

But in my school they tend to make a point of it being a personal decision. So they explain it in detail that I know some places in the world don't but of course the teacher hasn't done the drug so...

While I don't smoke it I'm interested to see the appeal of it to those that do. How often do you smoke? Why? When did you first do it?

**EDIT 1** thank you all for your answers so far, keep em' comming. I'm still against smoking it myself but I have found it interesting to see why others do it.

**EDIT 2** Thanks for all the answers guys/gals. I have a different oppinion on weed now. I still don't and won't smoke it, I'm still against drugs in general, but I'm not going to lie I was pretty judgy to those that do now I see that there are a ton of reasons people smoke and I respect that. 




 Hi, I am very new to meditation, seriously I just started today. 

So my first try only lasted a few minutes. I stretched before hand breathed a bit then sat down with my legs crossed. I had my back straight and simply focused on breathing in and out. I imagined a flower opening and shutting with my breath. Then I started 'feeling' (not touching but actually feeling) my body. I started with my toes and move  onto my feet and heels. Then I worked up my legs and into my torso untill I could feel my stomach. After this I started focussing on my breathing again. Then I pictured myself in a beautiful and lush green forrest. I heard birds, smelled flowers and saw a deer. It was beautiful but I only saw it for a few seconds or so. 

Finally I stopped. I felt incredible, so relaxed. To be honest I only did it llike half an hour ago and I still feel great. My stomach feels 'funny' I don't know how to describe it. My hands also feel funny but for them it feels like I'm shivering even though I'm not cold. 

I'm just wondering if this is a good start? I'm definitely intrigued and I'm going to do it again the morning but I'm worried about the possability of an out of body experience. I've heard people can have horrible visions and some feel connected to their hody through a thin chord. To be honest I feel fine about the visions but the obe scares me. 

Is it possible to have one through meditation? If so is there anyway to prevent it? Finally am I doing it properly?

**EDIT 1** is it weird for me to feel this happy? 




 So I have a friend on the internet (through xbox) who recently lost a friend to cancer. He said his brother was a Buddhist monk and taught him how to meditate. He seemed to be dealing with his friends death pretty well although he was obviously saddened.

Anyway I've heard him speak of meditation a few times now. I've done it once before but I was like half asleep and never knew what I was doing. 

I was intrigued so I read up on some basic mediation. I stretched. Felt my body parts. Breathed calmly. I took my self to a forrest in my mind and just relaxed. It only lasted for a few minutes if that but it was really nice feeling and I'm catholic, I've been told meditation is good for religion which I'll definitely have to look into but this looks promising for me. 




 I loved 'psycho' so I was worried that they made this. Season 3 starts soon and I read some reviews which say it's very good. I was worried that it might ruin psycho for me. Anyway is it worth watching? 









 Hi, I'm from Scotland, UK and like I said above I'm fifteen. Go ahead ask me anything! 














 When I play my xbox it will randomly freeze in game or on the dashboard.  This is happening alot! Seriously it just keeps happening, I've tried doing a power cycle but still it keeps happening, any suggestions? 









 I watch a lot of US tv shows and movies but what do they miss out that would be weird compared to the way I live? 









 It seems like we hear a lot about cancer nowadays but why did we not hear about it in say in medieval times or quite as much in the fifties etc? Was it due to fear or just that it has been mutating more in recent years?

EDIT: Thank you everyone for your answers you've all been a big help :) 




 Edit: thank you everyone for your great answers! :D 









 I've been seriously considering teaching as a career. I love kids and I would love to be able to imoact them and make school fun while still teaching them what they need to know.

I'm from Scotland, UK so the education system might be different where you're from but I have a few questions...

1. Is it rewarding? I like to think it would be but I don't want to go into it and be disappointed

2. What don't you like about it?

3. What is your favourite thing about it?

Also I want to either teach at a primary school age (elementary) or as a history teacher in a high school.

 




 Please don't get angry at me for asking and if this question offends anyone I'm sorry. Im catholic so I don't understand why you wouldn't want your prophet shown, please explain it. 




 He was looking at pictures of women in thongs were spiderman was walking behind them and he said:

"Yeah, I have a whole subreddit for superhero thong shots"

Other people wouldn't have got that joke. After the episode aired I checked and someone had already made a new subreddit for superhero thong shots...

/r/superherothongshots 









 Okay so I'm from Scotland and I'm in high school. In two weeks time I have prelims, they are essentially practice exams but they're still important cause, well I won't get into it but failing them is bad.

Anyway I'm a pretty smart guy and I never really fail tests but when it comes to exams my mind kind of blocks. I really don't want to fail.

Also I play way to much xbox, I know this but when I have to choose between studying and xbox 7/8 times out of 10 I'll go with xbox even though I know it's the wrong choice.

Anyway I need to know how I can force myself to study and not sit on xbox/reddit.

P.s please don't tell me to pull out my xbox plug I've tried that.
 




 Ok before you answer please don't say that we wear kilts, we only wear them at formal occasions and only some of us do it, they're normally only worn at weddings and funerals. 




 Hey everyone, I'm a HUGE xbox fan. I've had the original and 360 since their launches. I was going to get the xbox one on launch day but decided to wait a year because that's when the games I wanted came out. Anyway I know about the ability to video gameplay and upload it to skydrive and youtube but is it easy to use? 

Can you... add in music?
... make and intro?

Also can you tell me any cool features that you can use with it? 














 Okay so I'm 15 and I've wanted to be a doctor for as long as I can remember. My twin brother has cerebal pulsey (I think that's how you spell it) and slight autism. He can walk and talk and do everything everyone else can do to some degree but when we were young he was in the hospital for an operation and I knew after that, that I wanted to be a doctor.

Anyway I've been well on track. You know highest grades in all my classes and getting great reports but I don't think I'm up to it. I've always been a gamer, seriously I got the original xbox when I was 5 and before that I had the ps2 anyway I've always been able to balance school and gaming but now I find myself on my xbox and writing fanfictions more than anything. 

My grades have started slipping and I know if I stopped gaming I could probably get them back but I don't want to stop completely. Also I have pretty severe asthma so I miss quite alot of school during the winter when it gets bad which makes catching up hard aswell.

I still want to be a doctor but even if I put in the work I don't think I could make it so I would rather focus on something else and pass rather than try for years and fail.

I love writing and I love history. I've considered becoming a history teacher but I don't know if I would enjoy teaching the same stuff over and over again for years. So I thought about becoming a writer but I'm not sure if I would like to write a book or work for a company or anything else. I've started stressing because I don't know what my future will hold and to be honest I'm scared I'm going to mess up and get a crappy job.

Does anyone have any ideas on what I could do? I want to do something that makes me happy but I don't know what that is yet. 





























 Hi everyone, I have an account with everything on it but my sister doesn't. She has only just started playing and I was wondering if anyone could help her out. She doesn't use reddit and she asked me how I got my stuff when I said through reddit she asked if I could get her some. If you can please comment or message me.  














 Ok so I need one that can, as the title says, run both the Sims 3   4, my budget is 400, please leave a link to one that I can buy that I don't need to build (if it's a desktop). I know it's alot to ask but if anyone could help it would be much appreciated, I can  also add delivery charges if I need to. 




 Hey everyone, so I've always been more of a console gamer, only using my laptop for the Sims when gaming on it. Anyway it broke and I need a new one that has the system requirements for me to play both the Sims 3   4 with expansions for 3. Please help. Leave a link to one that I can buy but I only have 400. 

















































 I know a lot of people like that, me not so much I don't spend that much time on them. 




 Oh that's too bad, a pretty young age to start, you should ask your doctor about ways to quit. 




 I think a lot of people have that :) 




 Me too :) 




 That's not so great, maybe you should talk to her about it or get some kind of help. If you don't she might leave you and you'll regret it. Hope everything turns out ok. 




 I love gaming, I don't really exercise but I game a lot!!  




 That's not so bad, I love music too :) 




 Ha, ha okaaaay. 




 Not drugs or alcohol etc 




 Yeah, I mean you don't have to do it for ***everything*** I know I don't but it helps with quite a lot. It actually wasn't my idea, I saw it on another post and used it from there :) 




 I've always wondered about this, if it is Earth where are other planets and/or stars. Why is only Earth visible? 




 No, I think you're thinking about call of duty. Halo doesn't get all those 13 year olds spamming the chat. 




 Oh my god!! That's awesome as a huge halo fan that ring makes me want to kill someone for it but that's great for both of them. 




 Hey welcome to nofap. You're in a good position that you have college to keep you occupied and a girlfriend who you have sex with. Anyway it won't be easy but good luck, here are some [tips](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/2vrsoe/wow_times_flown_by_nine_day_report_and_some_tips/)
 




 No, the guy in the picture is from an episode of south park and he says:

"... your gonna have a bad time" 

Throughout the whole episode. So I made it for south park fans. 




 Okaydokay 




 Thanks :D 




 Okay, the guy in the picture is only in one episode and he constantly says your gonna have a bad time. 




 Thanks for all the tips, 15 here, never been addicted to PMO but wanted to quit cause I don't like what it does to people in the long run. 




 http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/2vrsoe/wow_times_flown_by_nine_day_report_and_some_tips/

Here are some tips to help you through, good luck!! :) 




 No matter what don't have an affair. Either leave yiur wife if you're un happy or stay with her and her alone. 




 Cbc? (Conspiracy?!!) 




 True. Do you like south park? 




 Okay. 




 I'm 15, almost 16, hang in there. Just think if you do it right you can lead a virtually porn free life!! :D here are some tips I poste  yesterday, hopefully they'll help.

http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/2vrsoe/wow_times_flown_by_nine_day_report_and_some_tips/ 




 Ha, ha I'm sorry but that's funny. I saw the post that inspired this sub, I highly doubt we would all lose the ability to sneeze. 




 I think it would just be another forgotten website. 




 So it's some kind of joke?  




 Sure...

* Less anxiety

* more do less talk

* more motivated

* less procrastination

* Better view of women

* more confidence

* better self image

* control of your body

* deeper voice

* more time

* less embarrassment

* not having to worry about clearing search history

* and tons more! :D 




 I mean I get /r/nofap (I'm a part of it) but why /r/nosneeze? 




 I love it on christmas day when I look around at my family, just for a few seconds, and I look at their huge smiles.  




 Dying light. It has really fun co op with friends and a huge map you'll likely have way more fun on that than on evolve. 




 http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/2vrsoe/wow_times_flown_by_nine_day_report_and_some_tips/ 




 Hey welcome to /r/nofap!! Good luck I hope this sub helps you out I leave a link to some tips I posted yesterday that might help you out.

Good luck!! :D 




 Good luck! We can both make it there!! :D 




 Me too :) good luck!! 




 Good luck! 




 I'm at ten days too! :D great job and good luck. I'm having all these benefits too. I'm more of an indoor/gamer type person but I'm going out more, seeing friends that I normally only see at school and the dreams have been great, a lot more vivid but of course Istill play a ton of xbox :) 




 Happy single awareness day!! :D

Good luck :) 




 Nice picture (I like how you added the fapstronaught :) ) 




 That's not what anyone here thinks. We decide not to fap for a ton of reasons:

* More time

* Better sex (actually able to finish unlike a lot of people who watch porn)

* more energetic

* more confidence

* better outlook on life

* in control of our bodies

* and a million more!

Research this sub before you talk crap about it! 




 Great job so far! So close! :D 




 Sorry, what? 




 Wow great job making the ring! And congratulations on your engagement I hope you two have a great wedding, a wonderful honeymoon and a fantastic life together :) 




 Nah don't reset I mean that's different when you're awake it's different but it was still just a dream. 




 Hey I'm 15 so I don't think it makes it mored difficult. In fact we're lucky because we can actually live a porn free life, good luck! :) 




 Ha, ha :) 




 Ha, ha :)


"By this point she'd been dead longer than I knew her"

I guess him and Mona got kinda close. 




 Ha, ha Randy is great I loved it in season 18 when he was Lorde :D 




 Do you mean in ways of an affair? If you do, don't it's wrong. If you mean you want to move on then just go out meet people, ask friends to set you up, try online dating. 




 Final fantasy has some great love stories. 




 I know right! I love it, what's your favourite episode? 









 I know right! :) 




 I hate uncharted, more of a TR guy but I get why people like it :) 




 Nice choice, I loved them together :) 









 I liked it, it was exciting... I just realised how sad I am. 




 I know!! :D 




 I'm 15 so I really don't want to... yet. 




 Were I was attacked by Freddy Krueger. You all know the movie right? Well I've watched it a million times and it's still never scared me (lets be honest who has it scarred?) and to be honest this dream was awesome!

So I was in the dream and he was in my kitchen, I grabbed a knife and tried to stab him, knowing it wouldn't work, I ran outside with him still chasing me. I met a girl I knew and he had been tormenting her too so I gave her the knife and said:

"Hurt yourself! Cut your arm, feet something!"

She said 

"Why?!"

And I replied

"If you can hurt yourself in the dream you'll wake up but just don't make it something that can kill you!"

So she did and all of a sudden she vanished so I picked up the knife and tried to hurt myself, Freddy still getting closer, but it wouldn't work no matter what I tried, the knife was like plastic now. Eventually he caught up and started suffocating me while laughing. I managed to get him off and ran for the hills. I don't remember much else but it was amazing!! (Because you know I love movies and the first nightmare and elm street is one i have a soft spot for). 




 I made it to get /r/freedonuts for the simpsons tapped out and then I realised there were a billion and one other things to do here so I decided that I would check it out and use it, now I love it! :)

My username is xbog4mer because I'm a gamer that plays xbox also I like the number 4. 




 I'm 15 but I turn 16 next month :) 




 Ha, ha nice question.

Searching amazon for masquerade masks and ball gowns.

Their porn would be a woman undoing her hundred button boots

Searching for the nearest carriage number.

Checking how much it costs to travel to the new world :) 




 Ha, ha thanks :) 




 Nah, I prefer xbox but you can't deny how awesome they'd be. Sure they copied her, then she copied them but still it would be nice. 




 Oh by the way I'm a HUGE xbox fanboy and prefer Lara but I hope everyone can appreciate how cool they'd be together. 




 That's why I want to stop, it's not a problem so this has been relatively easy for me but I want to stop before it becomes a problem. 









 http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/2vrsoe/wow_times_flown_by_nine_day_report_and_some_tips/

I wrote that earlier, there's some tips if you want them. I love dragon age. Bioware are great I can't wait for ME4 




 A slug! Or a snail! 




 Yeah I feel great and yeah gaming I'm doing it now while I'm talking to you :) How's your nofap going? 




 No but it brings you closer to orgasm which is basically setting yourself up to fail. 




 Yeah. If I don't thay stay in my trousers and it's kinda painful. 




 Bill Gates 




 If you want. I wasn't addicted or anytbing either but I decided to try it and it's going great! You seem like you have it under control so if you don't want to that's cool but it will only work if you really want to stop. 




 Awesome, I love playing classical, romantic and modern (I like everything really but they're my favourites). 




 Good luck to you! :D 




 Thank you, good luck! :D 




 No cause then I wouldn't have learned from it but I think this sort of stuff should be taught in schools so that people don't fall into it.

Anyway good luck to you! :D 




 Thanks! I've never been addicted or anything but it was making me lazy and I was thinking things like all women fake orgasms. I know that's not true but when I do have sex it'll be with a girl I care about (at least 3-5 years from now, I don't want to have it too young). It will be much better than fapping. Anyway good luck to you :) 




 That's great! What's your favourite song to play? 




 This shouldn't be in /r/gaming it should be in /r/gambling 




 Do the small things. Volunteer for a charity. Donate old things. Give a homeless person a nice hot drink and a sandwich. 




 Don't give up you can do it! Here I wrote a report an  some hints earlier, hopefully they'll help...

Good luck!
 




 I know most people do these on their tenth day but hell I'm in a great mood.

I've been studying more, playing less xbox but still enough for fun and of course I don't waste time fapping. I'm only 15 so obviously I'm a virgin which made me think:

"I don't know if I want to quit cause I won't have sex for years"

But it's worth it. It feels like I stopped yesterday and sure I've had alot of urges but this is fun and I'm already seeing some benefits!

Good luck to all of you out there. I'll leave some tips for those of you that feel like you can't make it.

* Say "YES" or "NO" to everything. Am I going to fap? NO! Am I going to study now instead of procrastinating? YES use this and it really helps.

* Use the 10-10-10 rule. If you fap now how will you feel in 10 minutes? In 10 hours? And if you quit nofap how will you feel in 10 years?

* A lot of men on here say they have trouble "finishing" during sex because of how much they've fapped, I'm only 15, like I said, but I don't want that to happen when I do have sex. Do you?

* Think of the fact that porn is just filmed prostitution. No one wanted to be a porn star as a kid. 

* If you want you can meditate, I do and it helps.

* I'm religious so that's a motivation for me.

* Think of the regret you'll feel later.

* don't try and stop urges just acknowledge them and then say ah well now I'm going to go and... (do something else, basically acknowledge it and move on)

Good luck guys/girls!! :D
 




 So true but many people in porn actually enjoy it I remember a few pornstars doing AMA's a while back. Of course most of the time what you said is the truth. 




 I'm 15, porn got me when I was 11/12. I was never addicted but I have a few ways to stop fapping when I think about it.

1. Think that porn is just filmed prostitution and that it is wrong 

2. Break questions down into yes or no. Should I fap, no. Should I do my homework now, yes. Should I...

3. Think about all the guys on here that say they can't cum when they have sex due to PMO. How horrible it would it be if you lose your virginity (if you haven't yet, I haven't and I don't want to for a few more years yet) and you can't "finish". 

4. Think about the 10-10-10 rule (yes I got that from another post). How will you feel in 10 minutes if you fap now? How will you feel in 10 hours? And how will you feel in 10 years if you quit nofap now?

Good luck :) oh and try not to thibk about porn or sex so much, I never really have but who knows everyone is different. When porn/fapping/sex comes to mind acknowledge it and then send it away and think about something else. (Meditation helps too, I've been doing it for a bit now and it's really nice). 




 I know right, hopefully this will stop at least one relapse. 




 No don't reset it but learn from it and try not to do it again, good luck. 




 ...Filmed prostitution. Would you have sex with a prostitute? Would you watch someone else? That's all porn really is. It's disgusting (even if it doesn't seem like it when you watch). Think of this if you consider relapsing, you're about to be part of the reason that there is a demand for "filmed prostitution". Instead don't be, even if you, yes you, alone don't take part in it then you will know that. It might not make a difference, it won't make porn go away but at least you won't be part of the problem. 




 I'm 15, I started when I was 11/12. I've never been addicted but I just don't want to be a part of filmed prostitution, cause that's all porn is. 




 Okaaay  




 Ha, ha mine too (next to milk, not together... obviously) 




 Hey no problem :) good luck. 




 Hopefully not too long. 




 Ha, ha never :) 




 Ha, ha my sister and her bf of 6 years recently had a kid, she's almost two. Anyway she asked "what's that?" Talking about her vagina when she was getting changed so my sister told her "that's your wee lady" (we're Scottish so imagine the accent). Then the next day she's naming and pointing at my body parts when she's visiting me. Eyes, nose, ears, mouth, hair, wee lady. I'm so happy I wasn't in public but I burst out laughing! :D 




 I like your thinking! :D 




 Oh god, that wasn't even funny embarassing, I hooe your husband was ok :) 




 I don't know I'm not god. I can't answer this but I still have faith. I'm going to stop here cause I don't want these comments to turn into a religious battle (ha, ha battle with swords and stuff) but if you want to talk feel free to pm me. It's up to you :) 




 Ha, ha that must've been bad :) I mean do you laugh at it now (even though it was likely embarassing at the time) or do you still try and forget about it? 
























 I just relapsed today, don't worry about it. I'm just going to pick myself up an  learn from it. Here, good [luck](http://imgur.com/cU848GQ) 









 The last time I started nofap I made it to twelve days and decided ah well... I guess you can guess what happened. Now I'm resetting my counter for the third and last time!! If anyone else is really serious message me and we can help each other stay on track but if you're not serious please, don't waste my time. 




 Hey no problem :) 




 I'm a guy, I do. I think it looks nicer going bald for a number for a number of reasons. It makes you look bigger, if you know what I mean. It looks cleaner. Feels nice and smooth. And a million other reasons. 




 I understand about most things being drugs but I'm talking about illegal drugs. Even if it became legal though I wouldn't go near it just like I don't smoke ciggarettes. 




 Cause it's a drug, I would never go near it but I'm not against those that do. To each his own. I dislike the idea of it cause it seems to dumb down those that take it and it stinks worse than anything!! 




 But I grabbed his arm back, then a monstrous creature arose from the drug. It turned out it was a super scary homogenous sassy Hasidic Jewish snow yeti... 




 It turns out uncle Ben, yes old uncle Ben who is always so kind and collected, was part of an underground snail racing club and they were feeding the snails steroids. When I bailed him out we went home. He laughed about it, even back then. When we got home we walked into our tiny, tiny apartment and we couldn't believe what we saw...

 Hi I'm scottish too :)

I...

* Get up

* eat

* wash

* Get dressed

* watch tv

* go to school  




 I'm not done with it by my face has gotten longer and I look a lot better.  




 Yeah, I love his videos. I've been watching him since he only had a few thousand subscribers (I'm not a hipster :) ) but yeah his videos are supercalifragilisticexpidaliotious. 




 Can I ask, do you watch Matthew Santoro on YouTube? 




 Jesus Christ!! Yes! Tell someone and help get it dealt with. 




 Exact same for me I have a big family my mum has it better/worse depending on how you look at it. She had 7 brothers and 6 sisters and  5 of the boys are dead. 




 I know right they foreshadowed what's going to happen to poor Glenn, Mwahaha, mwahahahaha!! 




 I know I'm not him but a lot of celebrities make reddit accounts so they can do AmA's I mean look at /u/boogibs she did her Ama, posted one more thing and left. She might not be a big name but it's still the same. 




 Did you like the way you died on the Walking Dead? Do you think Tyreese deserved better or do you think it was his time? 




 Ok thanks (I'm so I don't have a wife yet). 




 You're welcome, good luck again :) 




 I've done (am still doing) nofap and it was/is very helpful but I was just wondering if masturbation is a sin. 




 Hello, first of all thank you for not just assuming that all religious people are "bible bashing idiots" and taking the time to form your own opinions. I have many reasons for following my religion. Jesus was alive, that has been proven, now people might not believe in the virgin birth or in the miracles like we do, however, I think that even if it turns out that every religion on Earth is wrong it is better to believe in something, anything, and have a chance at going somewhere better. Now that's not why I follow my faith. I follow it cause it's a nice way to live life. Sure even non religious people can lead great lifes and most do but it's nice having some guidelines. Also I feel like we have added emotions. When we feel like we've done something good that will please the lord it lasts long and if we sin the guilt is immediate. I also wonder how people can look at our  universe and not believe in god. I don't believe everything in the bible for example Adam and Eve. I think that story is used to show why there is sin and suffering in the world. When people ask why a god would allow such horrible things like rape and murder to exist the answer isn't simple. I don't know it. I don't. I'm having trouble wording this but religion is there and I would be willing to die for mine. I know that sounds extreme but it's true. I have a million and one thoughts in my head but I can't word them so if they come to me later I will return and re write/word this post. Good day and god bless. 




 I'm not saying there is but don't you think it would be better to say nothing than say something mean? Or at least try and say something nice. Obviously you have an opinion and I respect that but I don't agree with how you voice it. 




 All done, good luck with your project. When you get an A+ come back and let us know :) (no but seriously I hope you do well). 




 Thank you, so I should stop. Whenever I "finish" I feel horrible. It's like I know I've sinned but I chose to do it anyway. 




 I know how you feel, I lost my dog. I'll say a prayer for you just now. I do think that animals get into heaven. I don't believe God would create them simply to send them to hell and I definitely don't believe that they just rot. So that leaves me with the conclusion that they get into heaven. 




 I'll add you to my prayers :) 




 I'll pray for you :) 









 I'm not the best looking or the worst and I'm not saying looks aren't important but I would much rather spend time with a girl who was a bit ugly but had a great personality than a girl that looked great but had a not so great personality. 




 Ok so if someone isn't great looking you make them feel bad by swearing? If you thought they were ugly you shouldn't have said anything cause it hasn't made you or them feel any better. 




 I know a ton of people my age that party, I just don't really enjoy being around people I don't know (I'm kind of introvert but happy and confident around friends but put me in an uncomfortable social situation and I become a weird version of myself. If I like someone though I will ask her out after weeks of forcing myself to just say it). Yeah a lot of 15 year olds party just not very regularly. 




 That's horrible. They went to a dance and had fun people's looks don't matter and I wouldn't say either of them are ugly... [this](http://www.bing.com/images/search?q=fat+and+ugly FORM=HDRSC2#view=detail id=AF9B62FE4D44CEB1E87FEE2D874F29F5B93C03EA selectedIndex=116) is ugly!!

(By the way I wasn't joking neither of them are bad looking). 




 Good for you two, hope you both had fun :) , 




 I never go out to parties :) 




 I know right!! (I used a kind of crappy app cause I was bored) 




 I want to be an archaeologist and I'm lucky cause I live in Scotland which still needs archaeologists. Failing that I want to study medicine and become a medical doctor. I also want to meet a girl, get married and have tons of kids but that can wait for a while :) 




 Dogs by far. They listen, play with you, spend time with you and will stand by you. Cats just sit there. I spend more time with my dogs than I do with people. 




 Thanks I found something that works for me :) 




 Although I'm not going to take it as a negative. I was twelve days though and as a teenager my hormones are already a mess so I was getting a lot of urges, for the most part I was able to fight them but then I said:

 I know I'll feel crappy and I know this and I know that but I want to...

So after I did it (don't worry I never used porn) I said:

"Okay no big deal, just get back up and start again"

And that's what I intend to do. This time I'm going to beat twelve days. I'm going to get up dust myself down and try again. This is actually good because I learned from it and that's why I'm not going to get mad or angry at myself. I got overly confident, the first ten days were fine so I became cocky, no more. So I'll see you all when I get another (1) in my badge and then a (2) and all the way up. For now I'm going to take it one day at a time. 




 Nice post!! :D 




 I love(d) scrubs but I feel like it got pretty bad when J.D wasn't there for the last while. I mean they referenced him but it wasn't the same. I still loved every season. 




 I want to be an archaeologist, I guess here it's different. I don't really know many people that consider themselves "photographers". 




 I know what you mean. I guess I just never noticed it before but sex is everywhere. I love the movie bad teacher but when I watched it again for the first time in a year or so last week I got so turned on. There's a carwash scene that I used to just shrug off but it's weird to see just how sexual everything actually is. 




 A lot of people say that it takes 90 days (+-30) before you see any real benefits so you have two options.

* Quit and try and moderate it but just don't watch porn

* push through for one more month and take it from there.

Good luck :) 




 I can back this up, as a socially awkward "nerd" I had few friends and in one of my first classes in high school I was made to sit with some guys. They became my best friends and we hung out all the time. That was just by chance.  




 Thanks you two :) 




 Do you shave? Which moisturizer do you think is best? 




 Great review, you just got a new sub!! :D 




 I loved that game, still do I've completed every tomb raider made (besides the crappy game boy ports) :) 




 Are you just finding this out? Ah well pretty cool huh? 




 Ha, ha that got on my nerves!! :) 




 I have long hair so for me I couldn't do that but kudos!! :D 




 Yeah go for it, just don't let your parents find out and if they do tell them you like her and want to go out with her. 




 So the past 11 days have been kinda easy for me so I checked nofap frequently and constantly reminded myself why I wanted to do this. Then today I never really came here and I was fine through most of it. You know the saying:

"Sex sells"

Well because of porn I never really noticed this and when I was watching tv there were so many hot things that I used to just shrug off. At first I was fine I did the usual, remind myself why I was doing it and said will I fap? NO! Then did the 10-10-10 rule. I was fine but it got worse so I edged onced but stopped midway and said:

"Do I want to throw the last eleven days down the drain? Do I want to feel the regret later?" I stopped and listened to some music. I now know 100% why I'm doing this. So I'm happy to say I don't have to reset my counter today and I've learned from this. Thank you all for the motivation here on nofap. 




 Ok thanks :) 




 How short do you leave it? I shaved it but I'm fine with letting it regrow to a certain length. I do think that if it's short it looks like you're just starting puberty. On the flip side I have something that's stopped all itching, nivea men 48 hr for sensitive skin, it's stopped all itching. 




 Do you shave? 




 Nah but I just got sick of my pubes getting caught on my boxers is all. 




 Good luck!! :D 




 I can imagine what are you studying. 




 Do you shave? 




 I know right :) 




 Okay that's what I did thank you :) 




 I've already shaved. I did it in the bath. Shaving cream, stroke, under water and then repeat. 




 Don't worry I'm 15 I don't plan on sex for another few years 




 Oh... thanks anyway. 




 Ok thanks. 




 Ok do you/have you shave(d)? How can I prevent an itch? 




 ***UPDATE*** can I ask, what do girls prefer? I don't plan on having sex any time soon but I'm just wondering. I know it varies from girl to girl. If you are a girl what do you prefer and if you're a guy what do you do? 




 Yes but it wasn't in this sub. I've always wanted to be a doctor but I love history too and I spoke to an archaeologist and she really inspired me now I'm studying that and I'm very grateful to her. 









 I found out today someone even made a sub called /r/yesfap just to oppose this!! 




 All done, I'm 15 so I'm obviously a virgin 




 Don't reset your counter, dreams don't count :) 




 I love Jenna Marbles she's hilarious!! 




 Check out /r/nofap if you want to quit the masturbating. 




 Ha, ha there's a few reasons say it like this:

Fap-stro-naut sounds like fap so not. We won't fap.

We're doing something most people won't

And if we stop fapping our life can finally take off (like a rocket) we get more self esteem, energy etc, etc. 




 Good luck!! You can do it, here are a few [tips](http://m.imgur.com/cU848GQ) that might help you out. :) 




 I agree. 




 If I were you I'd go to a doctor or you could try /r/nofap that takes away anxiety and gives a lot of benefits. Still I suggest you see a doctor incase something's wrong. 




 I know that's true. I had a dream were I failed it was awful but I woke up and couldn't believe that I was still going I was happy and it reminded me how bad it could get if you give in. 




 Ha, ha great job, good luck aswell you can do it!! :D If you want them here are some [tips](http://m.imgur.com/cU848GQ) that might help you. 




 Hey I like your attitude. Here are a few [tips](http://m.imgur.com/cU848GQ) that might help you out. For music wise I suggest Clean bandit, they play instruments beautifully and when they work with Jess Glynn it comes out amazing!! Their songs 'Real Love' and 'Rather Be' are great. Good luck. 




 Ha, ha :D 









 I played it, I loved it and I never had to deal with them. 




 Ha, ha :) 




 Thanks :) 




 Aaaw :) 




 I see what you're saying.  




 If it did you wouldn't be able to move around your house. 




 I love jurassic park!! 




 No I'm not I wanted to stop because I saw on here all of the negatives and I didn't want become like that, before I started I was only fapping once or twice a week.  




 Things like gaming can be considered addiction as the it exhibits the same withdrawl symptoms as drugs, chocolate and coffee contain caffein and porn has negative effects on the brain. 




 I love music and learning too :) 




 Well I love halo :) 




 I play the keyboard, piano, drums and glock :) 




 Maybe it has nothing to do with nofap I would go to a doctor if I was you and take it from there but do mention nofap to him/her. 




 Oh well waters good for you :) 




 Ha, ha you are excused :) 




 I love music too what instrument(s) do you play? 




 Cool well happy hoarding. 




 Oh that's too bad I couldn't live without milk. 




 I LOVE chocolate milk I drink it everyday!! :)

 Milk's nice and oretty good for you I drink a lot of that. 




 I love the justice league!! :D you should do the next few after the suicide squad. 




 I'm not fat but I drink more milk than anyone I know and I love chocolate!! :D 




 That's good you can still drink them but just do it in moderation, it will be good for you too since they both contain tons of sugar and sweeteners. 




 Cool but really 13TB oh my god you must have a lot!! :) 




 Ha, ha I think that's the strangest I've heard yet but if you enjoy it who am I to judge :) 




 Me too, I'm on here a lot recently. 




 Ooooh me too :) 




 Ha, ha I buy xbox games to play them although I must admit I do love the smell of new shoes. 




 Ha, ha :) good luck  




 Ha, ha I don't think I will. 
























 Ok, I don't have any spare codes but if you give me code I'll send you a link to a website for your xb1. On it you can play classic arcade games, app store games and other similar titles. 














 Are the codes together (both games in one code or desperate codes) 




 Thanks :D I was thinking of waiting till I see what days I'll be working. So if I was to work Mondays, Wednesday's and Saturdays I would come home and do revision/homework then leave for work and go to the gym on Tuesdays, Thursday's, Friday's and Sundays after homework/revision. The reason I don't just do gym or work is cause I dont want my parents to pay my gym membership since they pay for my Netflix, xbox etc so a job would let me pay it myself and get a few other things. I'll figure it out, thanks for answering. 




 I know it's been removed but force yourself. Just make yourself do it. In my old school I liked a girl, this was two years ago. I was too late when I finally went to ask her out. By the time I went to ask her she had gone with someone else and they're still together. I moved on and later found that I really ***liked*** my friend Chelsea. We had been friends for years and I said screw and asked her. She said yes!! I moved away not long after which really upset me but at least I asked her. Just force yourself before it's too late. 




 Me too. I have friends outside if school who I lobe being with and friends at my old school.  It the people I talk to in school aren't going to be people I'll talk to when schools done or in the summer etc I'm just kinda ***that*** friend too. 




 We play xbox. Watch movies. Go to the cinema. Go to the comic-book shop and walk around when we're bored. 




 Hey guys. I turn 16 this month and I'm going to get a part time job. I also decided that I would start going to the gym. How can I balance school, homework/revision, work and gym? Do any of you do this?  









 Let's do this!! 




 I love it too and I've re-read it a few times but nowhere near fifty!! :D 




 Oh that's too bad. You should definitely re-read them. 




 I love the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy!!  




 No problem :) 




 I love the the Harry Potter series. I'm re-reading it now in fact. 




 Oh I loved the Harry Potter series. I've actually just started re-reading it again for like the fifth time. 




 For book tips I suggest you read:

"GONE"

 By Michael Grant l. It's a six book series and I absolutely loved it!! I became so attached to the characters and hated some and so never found a second of any of the plots to be dull or slow moving. Definitely worth your time. Just a tip they are read in this order:

* Gone

* Hunger

* Lies

* Plague

* Fear

* Light 









 I never hack accounts. I know how to but I would never do that. I also never mod online games. I will only ever mod so how player games or sections of games because I can make things more fun. I do it for my pc games and sometimes for my xbox games. Like I said though I would never annoy someone with nodding or hacking. When I rarely take mods online it's with my friends and we just mess around. For the most part I just prefer to play the game without mods because I think it's better the way it came. Gta Iv and skyrim are great for mods. 




 My top 5 in no order:

Tomb raider series (old and reboot)

Halo series

Gta series

The walking dead (telltale games)

Mass effect series

(Some honourable mentions: Elder scrolls and fallout series, and the Sims series) 




 I'm starting to workout and want to see how far others have made it. Though I won't be working out obsessively. I'm going to start the gym in March/April but right now I'm just doing it around the house. 




 When I started nofap I made it to around two weeks (I'm a teenager and my hormones got crazy) now on my second try I made it to 3 days. I know it's not great but I've learned from it. 

In the time I quit I've started going outside with my friends... a lot. I used to never go outside I would only talk to them at school and through the internet. 

I'm a typical "nerd" so I don't have giant muscles etc but I started working out.

I've stopped procrastinating... as much and I only play my xbox for an hour or so a day now (I used to play for at least 7). 

All of this is great and just because I relapsed isn't going to stop me from doing them. Even if I was fapping regularly I could do this but nofap helped me realise it. 

All of this could just be a placebo effect because I read about other people's benefits from nofap. Even if it is I don't care. I don't because I feel more energetic and alive and I owe that to nofap. 

I'm going to start again today and hopefully make it. But untill then I'll just go a day at a time, learn from my mistakes and keep the benefits. 




 Finally!!  




 Hello everyone. I'm a 15 year old guy. I'm about 5'6 tall and I'm pretty skinny but not underweight. I'm wondering if I'd maybe look weird with abs and noticeable upper body muscles since I'm so short.   Also I have asthma which is another reason I want to start, to help improve my lungs. I kind of look like a typical geek (which I kind of am which makes posting here weird for me since I never work out) Can any of you give me any tips on how to get upper body strength, abs and a good work out plan. I don't want to take protein shakes etc but I'm willing to eat healthier.  









 I'm from Scotland and when I saw this on the news I found it kind of annoying. He isn't a pervert or anything and he makes kids happy. 




 Not a theory. Read the books. In them it's heavily, heavily hinted at. 




 Exactly. It wasn't the people's fault and the children were indoctrinated so much so that they worshipped Hitler right up untill their death!!  




 I agree with you 100%. The people were going through a tough time, to say the least. They were desperate Hitler, a great speaker who had won medals in the war for bravery offered them away out. He would defy the treaty of Versailles and lead them back to power and happiness. That's how they saw it was just that he was a cunning deceitful man who managed to gain power. Like you said though it might not be the best time to release it but I agree that we should learn from history, move on and not repeat it. 




 I agree (not as an American, I'm scottish). The people were going through a tough time, to say the least. They were desperate  Hitler, a great speaker who had won medals in the war for bravery offered them away out. He would defy the treaty of Versailles and lead them back to power and happiness. That's how they saw it was just that he was a cunning deceitful man who managed to gain power. Like you said it could happen in any country. 




 Leave it doesn't matter if he's the "best man ever" when he's sober!! No matter what call the police and leave him. 




 Post this on /r/relationship_advice 




 Exactly!! I do think it was necessary to start with due to Hitler's indoctrination of the young Germans of that time.  




 I agree take something away and it makes it more desirable. I do think it was necessary to begin with though due to the fact that most of Germany had been indoctrinated by Hitler and the Nazis but the fact is Germans of today don't agree with what happened.  




 I agree with you one hundred per cent. People seem to have a mind set that Germans are all Nazis because of what happened 75 years ago.  




 They're great!! :D 









 Stop masturbating. It's often cause of the fact that you have left over sperm in you urethra. 




 Yeah they're good together :) 




 Actually no I'm not. I have very high marks in all of my science classes which I love and history, music, maths and English. I just don't believe that dinosaurs existed. I do believe humans have been too the moon but I don't think it was when they said it was. I'm not into conspiracy theories but I just don't believe it.  




 I love them together!! :D 




 I don't believe that dinosaurs ever existed and I also think the moon landing was fake and it was a way for the Americans to win the space race (I'm not Russian) but I do think that it has been landed on since. 




 Okaaaay... 




 I don't know I've never really liked Jackie Chan but I see why you'd like them a lot of people do. 




 Me too they have great chemistry on screen and you just know that they're friends offscreen too. 









 Great!! :D when you get it if you need someone to play just pm here and I'll add you :) 




 Yeah archaeology. I know it's tough but I know archaeologist and I'm from Scotland there is still a place here which actively hires archaeologists. Thanks if I have any questions I'll message you!! :D 




 I want to be either an medical doctor or an architect (I'm still undecided but I've wanted to be a doctor since I was 3 and been thinking a lot about archaeology for a while now). So I'm going to volunteer at a dig and help out at my local hospital but both are voluntary and I want to be able to make my own money during the summer :) 




 Do you remember what it was like when you were dead? 




 Aaah the invention of the wheel... I remember it well. 




 How old are they?

I suggest you take them out too the movies and buy them a nice meal that they wouldn't eat on a regular basis so something like a McDonald's if they don't get them a lot. Then before you come home buy them a movie. When you get there build them a couch fort, lay out a ton of candy, ice cream, biscuits and cake etc then put on the movie (make sure they pick which one in the store). Let them sleep down there and wake them up in the morning with cartoons and pancakes. It's a lot of work but they'll love it!! 

That's if they're a bit younger basically not teenagers yet. If they're older just say and I'll give you some tips :) 




 Hi, it really depends on you. Both have some great exclusives and great players. I'm personally more of an xbox guy but I'll list the pros and cons of both

***xbox one pros***

It has a great interface

Ability to "snap" apps which means that you can play a game while watching a movie or skypeing etc

A lot of amazing exclusives and timed exclusives like tomb raider, sunset overdrive and halo

A great company ( MS) 

***Wii U pros***

Great exclusives like Zelda, Mario and a bunch more I honestly think it's one of the most under rated consoles ever!!

It's unique with the controller I like having the pad.

It's a nice slim console

It is backwards compatible with Wii games

It is free to play online

It's cheapei

It's good for families

***xbox one cons***

If you buy one it will cost you more than the Wii u

It is pretty big (not as huge as people make out but it takes up some space)

You have to pay a monthly subscription

It's not backwards compatible with previous xboxes

***Wii u cons***

It doesn't have as many online players as xbone/ps4 but it's not a huge deal

Even though it has a ton of great games and exclusives it doesn't get some of the best games like gta.

It can't be used for things like tv unless of course you're using netflix etc




Both consoles are great so either way you should be happy. Happy gaming, when you choose let us know what you pick and I'll play with you :) 

 




 Hi reddit, I turn 16 in March and I'm still a student. I'm wondering if any of you know of any types of jobs I could do part time. I don't mind if it would only be for the summer or if it would be year round. I live in a suburban area of a city so I can easily get to malls etc. Any help would be appreciated. 




 Because I have a lot for 360 and mainly only dlc  for the one. 




 Ok cool if you want I have a halo MC collection dlc and some gta money and as for games (I mainly have physical copies) but I have a few codes. What type of games do you like? 




 Oh also if you don't like the games I say later if you're in the UK I'm willing to post them to you and I won't ask for the code untill you get the game in the mail. 




 Hi, do you want a game code for 360 or one. 









 Oil isn't all we have. We have tourism, agriculture, whiskey and about 50,000,000 other attributes, people only seem to think about oil. 




 Ha, ha!! :) 




 I'd sent them a postcard :) 




 While we're technically together Scotland has a lot of its own laws, it's on education system and by politicians I meant where they're from.  




 I'm not going to get into it cause I'll just rant. I don't so much hate the English people (well I hate some English but not cause they're English, I don't judge people cause of where they're from). Anyway I hate your government, politicians and a lot of English people (but like I said not cause they're English).  




 Still you touchy for me too. 




 Hopefully there will be a next time. 




 I know it's weird but I like our weather. If you put all Scots in the heat for too long we fry 




 :) I agree 




 I agree we don't need the union. 




 I agree :) 




 I agree 100% 




 Yup scottish here. I don't like being called Brittish so I guess you can figure out that England isn't exactly my favourite place. 




 Why?  




 Has your opinion changed since the referendum?  




 Ha, ha true. I occasionally watch the river side show on stv Glasgow but not often. 




 I would remove Scotland from England and move it (Scotland) and Ireland slightly closer to Norway.  




 Actually all the UK has done is made people ignorant about us. We have a ton of tourists visit here year round and that has nothing to do with being in the UK. It's to do with our land, the people, our myths and a ton of other things. Being in the UK is simply a drain of our resources. 









 In Scotland we have [stoor worm](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoor_worm) which is the equivelant of the Norse midgard serpent which, was also called the world snake. 




 I love Scottish culture but hate that we're part of the UK. 




 I guess xbox, science, books, music, movies and shows. It depends on the person. 




 I will, I hope she gets better. I'll say a prayer now and at mass tomorrow (if I make it). I' 




 I don't know if this will work but try /r/donate or /r/donations hopefully one will work  




 Ha, ha Hail sithis!! :D 




 How so? 




 Actually they are. People need to pay companies like Amazon to sell anything on their sites, then you throw in people that advertise there and, if I keep using Amazon as my example, they sell things like the kindle. 




 Shave or trim "down there". If done correctly it feels smooth, looks nice, stops you from sweating as much,  stops odour, protects against crabs for those of you that have a lot of sex and a bunch of other positives. 




 I made it for motivation not to discourage anyone. 




 Thanks, sorry it turned into this.  




 Well at least we now know reddit masturbates.  









 Hey you were the one who started this. You saw and said you would report me get over it!! Not everyone is religious, is there for those who are! 




 No, he'll is for the worst of people and as long as they haven't committed any seriously immoral sins (like murder, rape or anything along this  lines) I believe they will go to heaven. 




 I'm not forcing them on you. Simply by saying I have them is forcing them? If someone doesn't have a religion that's fine, to each his own but simply because it's there you started.  




 Look I put it in there for those that are religious, don't like it then leave. You can't complain about someone else's beliefs. Ok not everyone is religious but like I said it's there for those that are!! This really isn't a big deal. You're making mountains out of mole holes. No one else here has complained, look at the other comments that have stemmed from yours. Two other people agree with me. It's not a big deal. 




 /u/Poropopper don't worry about it I'll add it cause I know that a lot of people here do meditate and it might give them a boost :) 




 /u/decisionmadetoday you are basically saying someone can't even mention **their** religion without you getting all hissy pissy about it. Everyone has a right to their beliefs. I respect yours, please respect others. 




 I do it for myself and just cause even though no one gets all the negatives many do get at least some and I don't want that also I'm religious so that comes into play. 




 Thank you :) 




 Coolio that gives you a cool reason to keep going... untill you decide not to. :) 




 I never felt tired after fapping and during my last streak I definitely had more energy Infact I still do because I said I wasn't going to let myself lose it and I haven't!! :) I still prefer being on a streak than fapping. 




 Exactly :) 




 What did I do? All I said was that I added it for those that are. I made this to help motivate people and if you don't like it then go away. 




 And I'm the weird uncle that for whatever reasons lives in your basement :) 




 Thanks :) 




 Thank you :) 




 Sorry if you guys don't like it. I made it cause these are all things I've heard people say have happened to them and I thought I'd put all the negatives vs all the positives. 




 Ha, ha ***hillarious*** 




 Ha, ha :)  




 Oh well that's up to you. 




 Yeah a lot of people in puberty say that. I think it has something to do with their testosterone levels. 




 That's good then cause you don't have to go through what some others will, good luck :) I added all the other stuff for those that get it since I've seen a lot of posts mentioning these things. 




 I think I might add something about meditating since a lot of people do it. Yeah in fact I'll do that soon :) 




 Hey, I'm not saying everyone's going to feel any or all of these but I made it for motivation for those that do :) 




 Ha, ha I ***should*** add that :D 




 No I mean that a lit of people that watch too much porn come to disrespect women or think that their penis should be like 10 inches. Also I put religion in there for those that are religion. If you're not I'm sorry if it offended you. 




 I see what you mean. I'm not trying to say someone's going to get all of the negatives and/or all of the positives but this is what people have reported (all different people) so I figured it could be used for motivation. 




 Some people are religious. Some aren't. I put it in for those that are (like me).  
























 "Come play with us" :D what is the name of that hotel?! :) 




 Ha, ha I hated frozen. My twin absolutely loved it so all I ever heard was let it go and it just made me hate the film, also my niece watches it on repeat. I can't escape the evil!! :p 




 It's amazing to think that life is being created right now. I know we've never met but we don't have to its just a great thing that you, a stranger over the internet - - to me anyway, is going to have a kid and you can watch them grow and be there for them. Congratulations again 




 I enjoyed that film, it was nice to watch. I also really liked the message :) 




 I think mulan is mine to. She is such a strong character and I love how she manages to break few  of what's expected of her so she can be happy. 




 I love the lion king I remember the first time I ever watched it. What a great movie. 




 Oh I love Aladdin!! I love how Aladdin and Jasmine both have troubles yet they fix each other's, he gives her a sense of freedom and she gives him the freedom to live comfortably (no more poverty). Plus they both love each other which is great. 




 Well I'm taking part in /r/nofap so I could handle the masterbation part, I'm pretty young so I haven't had sex yet but as long as I could still have kids I would take the money but I would donate a lot of it since money doesn't buy happiness, I would however leave enough for me and my family to lead a comfortable life. 









 Come back here when your child is born and let us all know if you have a boy or a girl :) (if you want too :) ) 




 Ha, ha :D  




 Thats good, hopefully things will only get better for you. 




 That's terrible, I'm sorry you felt the need to do that. I hope everything's ok now? 




 That's great to hear! I'm sorry about your husband but at least things are good now :) 




 You're welcome, everyone's important, even if they don't know it. 




 Your welcome :) 




 Like I've said to a few people already I'm sorry you felt that you had to do it in the first place but know that there are people that care about you. I hope everything turns out ok. 




 I know I'm just a stranger on the internet but if you need someone to talk to I'm here.  




 I hope things do/did get better for you, I hope you got/get the help you deserve and I can tell, from that one sentence you love your parents. They love you too and if you ever need any help ask them. Things can change in an instant and they might be the ones to make that change. I hope things are good for you now and if they aren't I hope they get better. 




 I'm sorry that you felt like you had to do it in the first place and I hope that things in your life take a turn for the better. 




 I don't know what you've went through that made you feel like death was the only way out but you have people that love and care for you deeply. Please if you ever come close to it again, ask them for help. It might seem difficult, whatever is happening to you but you can beat it. 




 You might not be religious but you'll be in my prayers. I'm not qualified in anyway but if you ever need anyone to talk to my pm box is always open. You don't even have to say your name but one talk can change everything. 




 It's nice to hear that things are better for you. Hopefully you won't have to go through anything like that again. I hope things keep getting better and better for you. 




 I'm happy to hear that, stay strong.  




 I'm sorry you went through it to begin with, I hope things get better for you. You shouldn't have to adapt. You might not be religious but I'll say a prayer for you today. 




 Don't blame yourself. Maybe some help would've stopped it from happening but from what you said it sounds like stuff was already really messed up for him. 




 I hope everything's ok for you now.  




 How are things for you now? 




 I'm sorry that you had to go through whatever you went through to begin with but at least you're here now. 




 God bless, congratulations on becoming a dad. I hope you two have a smooth pregnancy and you have a happy, healthy boy or girl :) 




 Same sex school? That's too bad you should try going into a nearby town. 




 Ha, ha I get that with the amiibos :) 

Well I guess to start you should buy a starter pack. I take it you're getting 2.0? If you are then I reccomend either the avengers starter pack or the merida and stitch toy box pack. Then you can buy other characters. 

You probably already know this but you can get power discs which give you new toys, paints etc and some are rare so there's a lot to trade and collect. 

You can buy characters from the first game and they work just fine on 2.0 but don't buy any playsets from the first one since they don't work on 2.0

Most stores that sell characters do deals on them. For example the ASDA (I'm in Scotland) near me sells 2 for 15 and they sell packs like the girl power pack which gives you violet, rapunzel and vanellope for 13, so look out for deals and also check eBay and Amazon etc. Some characters there are overpriced, like Elsa for example in store she costs 10, online she costs between 20-50. You can get really good deals online though, for example you can get some older characters for 3 when they normally cost 10. 

If you have any questions just ask. 




 Thanks :) 




 Hey sorry I'm all out, I've given them all away :( 




 Your welcome :) 




 Sorry I'm all out now but I'll make another post when I get new characters 




 Hi, I'm going to give you the code :) 




 Hey I'll message you maleificent :) 









 Scotland - I find family very important, even though I argue with my brothers and sisters I love them more than life itself.
 




 Can you link them please? 




 I really want aladdins flying carpet and I'm willing to give 5 power discs for it. 




 Hey, don't mention it, I don't use them since I don't play it on ios or pc so I may as well give them to people who can get some use out of them. Like I said though I might not be able to find them all but if I fin maleificent or venom they're yours :) 




 Here's hopping. They're pretty good at delivering what people want. A lot of people wanted Aladdin and Jasmine and we got them. 




 Awesome!! :D 




 It would be great to have star wars imagine the possibilities, we could make our own star wars worlds!! 




 Hey I've edited the post, can you give it a read since so many people want stitch and merida I'm going to pick someone at random.  Yeah that's what I bought when I got the game

 I love Alice!! Have you ever played Alice: madness returns? 




 Is it normal for parents to freak out like that where you live? Don't worry you're not in any trouble she's over reacting. I'm from Scotland and whenever I start dating my parents just say things like 

"Ooooh do you kiss her?"

And stuff like that in joking voices, I've only had two girlfriends but they're really cool about it, I mean they joke about it and stuff but when they've met them they've been great, friendly and not at all embarassing. Plus they only do those joke voices for a few days. 

Anyway good luck keep us posted. 




 I think a fuppa is a weird way of saying pubes? If it is I shave, best thing to do is shave with the hair, down, untill your skin gets used to it, then after a few weeks if you keep it up you can shave against it for a closer shave. You should buy nivea men 48 hour anti-perspirant. I no longer need it but when I started shaving it made it stay smooth and I never once itched, eventually you get used to it and it won't itch.  




 I agree they already have a ton of gravity falls themed items so we should be able to act as some characters. 




 Oh he'd be great 




 No problem, hope you enjoy it :) 




 I know me too but I wish they would ad  more story, I know a lot of kids play it but it's mainly older people so they could make some more stories for the playsets. I would love to see Alice. 




 No problem :) 




 Yeah no problem, it also comes with rapunzel :) 




 Ok no problem :) 




 No problem :) 




 Hey no problem I'll message you now :) 




 Ok no problem, I'll message you now :) 




 I would love to see Mulan, lilo, maybe in some shape aeriel they could make underwater worlds which could let normal characters have breath metres and let characters like aeriel, or nemo explore under the sea.  




 Hey, I'd love to help out but I have a three week study period comming up soon so I will only be able to write once or twice a week, is that ok? 




 I might have to find a couple but here, in my hand I have: 

* ~~vanellope, rapunzel and violet (one card, only takes one of your codes away so you can pick another)~~

* ~~Aladdin~~

* ~~Jasmine~~

* ~~Falcon~~

* ~~Maleificent~~

* ~~Gamora/Star Lord~~

* ~~Merida/Stitch~~

I have more and I'll add them when I find them :)


EDIT 1: I'm glad I've been able to give some away, I've crossed out the ones I've given away. I was going to do this on a first come first serve bases but since so many people want stitch and merida I'll pick someone at random tonight. When I find them I should have maleificent, venom, hulk, gamora and around 4 more but I can't promise those ones since I'm not exactly sure where I've sat them but if I find them during the week I'll make a new post. I hope the codes I've given away so far are being enjoyed, I'll keep you all posted :)

Edit 2: I've given away every code I can find now, sorry if you never got one. I hope you all enjoy the codes that I've given. If I find any more I'll make a new post, sorry again if you never got one. 




 I have both, they really are great games. I did enjoy the playsets but to be  honest the missions are fun but not amazing. You can unlock some awesome things and do some really cool stuff but some times they are pretty repetitive. I think the incredibles, lone ranger and toy story playsets were the best and you can get most pretty cheap on Amazon. For the second one the playsets give some awesome maps like New York city.

I suggest you buy 2.0 since you can pretty much buy everything from 1.0 for the toy box with game currency (sparks), don't worry you don't pay for them you collect them. Plus the characters from 1.0 and the power discs can all be used in 2.0. Some of the best characters in my opinion are:


Violet (incredibles) she can go invisible and has some nice moves and force fields


Maleificent - when you get her wings she is amazing, her magic is strong but slightly slow which is a disadvantage but she is a great character


Stitch - he can't fly which is too bad because I've become so used to that but he can climb on walls, roll around in a ball and he is just an awesome character


Vanellope - she is unique because she can glitch around she says some funny stuff but I might be bias since I loved the movie


Alladin and Jasmine - both can jump pretty high, both look great and have decent voice acting, both have good projectile attacks and alladin can get a second costume if you buy the power disc


Merida - definitely bias here but I'm scottish like her which makes me absolutely love her 


Spiderman - I love his web swinging and wall climbing


Dash - his running is fun but a bit hard to control sometimes

Elsa - she can freeze enemies and is surprisingly strong 

I like basically every character except for the cars so I could go on for ever but a few honourable mentions go to 

Mrs incredible

Rapunzel

Gamora

Tinkerbell

Iron man

And hulk 









 Oh that makes a lot of sense, thank you I've been wondering about this for a while now. 









 I drink a lot of milk 




 ***F***ight ***A***gainst ***P***orn ***Z***ombies 




 Right now it's 20.14 




 I don't know if it'll be your thing but check out clean bandit, their songs: real love and rather be are both very good. They're not trance music but it's worth a listen. 




 Awesome!! I wouldn't call that doodling though. You have real talent.  




 Who is he? 




 Actually we now know who he was, he turned out to be a polish man. 




 1).  I kind of hope he does but I'm happy that they never took away ricks hand.

2). I agree  it could be a while but I'm excited for when we finally do.

3). I loved Carol and Daryl going to get Beth but the premier an  midseason finale were both amazing. 









 Thanks this actually helps. The main reasons I want to do it are that I love history and I would love to be able to inspire people, get to know them and like you said see them learn.  




 I suggest you wear black or grey dress trousers and a white shirt (maybe a tie) and some leather shoes. 









 Thank you I'll go there now. 




 Here everyone is paid the same. For example a male doctor would be paid the same as a female doctor and a male chef would be paid the same as a female chef, presuming of course they were at the same level in their career.  




 Wow sorry about your brother.  




 Here there are equal amounts of all teachers to be honest. Say for example there were five English teachers then there would be five-ish (although some subjects might need a few more if a lot of students tend to take it like biology and chemistry) for maths, Spanish, history, modern studies, music etc.  









 Actually they were always very anti-semetic. The people who created the KKK were bitter that the south had lost the civil war and that the slaves had been freed. So they made their robes and tried to scare recently freed slaves by telling them that they were the ghosts of dead generals from the war. As time went on they gained and lost popularity but they were at their height of power in the 1920's. Kkk parades were a common sight and they had thousands of members over the US. There was one incident in a small town, I can't remember the name right now, where almost every white man was a member of the klan and as such they could commit any form of racial crime without consequences since even law men had become members, this made life hell For pretty much anyone that wasn't a white Christian. 




 Do you enjoy what you do? I love history (I'm 15) and I've aced every test. I'm seriously considering going to university and training to become a history teacher. I have a few questions, if you could answer any I'd be so grateful:


* Do you enjoy it?


* What grades do you need to get into a university? (I know every one is different but what did you take? Also I'm in Scotland, UK so that will likely make a difference).


* Have you ever had a student that you truely liked (inspired you/you inspired them) or one that you just hated?


Anything else you could tell me about your job would be great!! thank you

 You too :) 




 No, don't worry about it. Edging is when you fap but don't orgasm but people on here who say they edge also say it normally leads to them having to reset their counter. 




 Hi, I'm 15 too!! :) (almost 16) and I've had a few good streaks but I left for a while and I came back yesterday. For me it made me more active (which was weird since I'm an indoor gamer type person), I felt more confident, procrastinated less and I'm just happier in general. Again I was a bit socially awkward. After I stopped I swore to myself that I would keep doing these things and so far I have. Even though it was hard I've forced myself to only game at weekends cause it was taking up too much of my time and study during weekdays, also I go out with my friends a lot more now, I used to only go out once in a blue moon. It is difficult and I don't know if we "need" a sexual release but going without one was fine with me (even though it was hard at times). If you do happen to fap don't get down on yourself, just learn from it and start again. Also if you decide that you don't want to do nofap just don't watch porn. Seriously if you think about it, its just filmed prostitution and you're watching other people have sex, finally read some of the horror stories on here, some guys watched so much porn that they ended up with erectile dysfunction. Good luck in your decision. 




 Oh I should mention thay I think it's total crap but my sister keeps saying it's not a porno and I want to settle an argument. 




 Post on /r/books 




 Yeah we have a different education system. 




 Thanks that's actually a big help. 




 Oh I like that I hope the op picks that one. 




 Hi, I'm from Scotland and I will be going into fifth year after the summer. When I leave School I want to go to university and train to become a history teacher and I was wondering what qualifications I would need to do this. I understand that I'd need history, maths, English etc. I'm doing fairly well in all of my subjects, besides maths. In all of them I am NAT 5 but in maths I'm NAT 4. Will this be enough to get me into a university to train since history doesn't really require maths. So basically I'm asking:

* What qualifications do I need

And

* Is a NAT 4 award in maths enough or do I need to continue it?

Please help, anything is appreciated. 




 They said 1 though :( 




 Kim Kardashian!! 




 Yeah I have halo. I'll send you my gamertag but I won't be online till at least Saturday or Friday because I have exams all week. 




 I normally put sugar on it and oh my god!! Try it chocolate porridge is amazing!!! 




 Do you put anything on it like salt, sugar or maple syrup and have you ever tried chocolate porridge? 




 Here it's 7.30pm exactly and I'm dreaming of it :) 




 Mmmm I actually can't wait till tomorrow now, I really want porridge. 




 I normally always eat cereal with a glass of milk or orange juice. If not that then I have porridge or a piece and sausage or egg and toast or a fry up. Most commonly cereal or porridge though. Oh and I live in Scotland. 




 Aaaw even though the surprise was ruined your having another kid!! :D Good for both of you, congratulations. 




 Well yeah but I mean like simple physical pain. Obviously crying if you seriously injure yourself is different. 




 Depends. If you cry when you get physically hurt e.g falling it's a sign of weakness. Cry emotionally e.g after the death of a loved one and it's a sign of humanity, love and strength. 




 I don't get it. It's just a picture of a door 




 I don't care about al Gore and who he influenced I make up my own decisions and I understand the science behind. 









 I'm nit American I only know who al Gore is through reddit. That guy has done nothing to influence me. 




 I never heard that it would happen in any of those years. It's just a fact maybe if you wouldn't be so ignorant and researched the science behind it you would understand. 




 It's hardly bullshit. 




 Humans simply because it would be better for the entire world. Wings = less planes = Less CO emissions = healthier earth. (I know the  should be down the bottom but I'm on my tablet and can't put it there).  




 Like Pac man, flappy bird, racing games and tons more. 




 Teacher, life guard or gynecologist. 
























 That's a quote. I read it years ago but who said it alludes me. 









 It's a great university and its definitely worth your time if you can get in. Good luck. 




 I know this is late but I'd say before they turn 10. Just take them down and both parents talk to them just explain to them. They will likely understand but it depends on the situation.

If the kids birth parents died then that should be explained to them and say that you love them very much and then co.fort them for a while. When they grow up they'd be grateful that you raised them.

If, however, the kids parents abandoned them explain why they did it if it's known. Like they were very poor and couldn't raise you. If it was something like they never wanted kids then you could tell a white lie.

 




 1) ok if it doesn't bother you fine

2) this ha  become a reason in many recent divorces. I'm not saying they're all down to porn but you start expecting a new women every time which makes sex with the same woman boring and repetitive.

3). Ok that's fine

4). Learn how to use grammar and then we'll talk.

5). Thank you

6). Ok that's fine with me I respect your opinion I just don't like the idea of watching others have sex right even if it's considered the norm and also prostitution is wrong in my eyes but if your ok with it I won't judge. 




 You can't. It only works once it might look like your pressing it but  it's someone else 




 Porn doesn't show real sex. It shows a guy and a girl fucking for money. Not pleasure or love. 

It teaches people to expect someone different people every time.

It makes any women that don't have pornstar bodies look "disgusting"

It makes you think all women like hard-core sex like anal or gangbangs. While some might most don't.

It has almost no benefits but plenty of issues. 

Not to mention that it's basically just filmed prostitution. 




 Is that were south park creators got the idea of a gay fish? 




 It's a sort of social experiment. Everyone only gets one push and we aren't to let it reach zero. If we wait till it was at one then pushed it once back to sixty it could last over a year but people have pressed it so much it to be done in a month. 




 Depending on how things go in May we could have one in five years. A lot of people who said no have now said they wished they had said yes. If we don't get it within the next decade there's no telling how long it could be if ever. 




 I like, like you. I'm weird. 




 Ha, ha Obama's my home-dog. No but in all seriousness I hate having to be part of the UK 




 I like you. 




 But you don't know that it's easier, I'm not circumcised and I find it very easy to clean it takes literally less than a minute. 




 The university is amazing. It's a bit expensive but it's defined Italy worth it and st Andrews is a great place. 




 Sounds pretty good, how many seasons are there? 




 Sounds interesting I might watch it and see what I think :) 




 What's it about? I don't think I've heard of it. 




 Let's talk about why we love our favourite shows and try and get other to watch them too. 

Who are your favourite characters?

Why do you like them so much?

What is the main story about? 

 




 I don't see the point in the button can someone explain it please? 




 Ha, ha he's an ass. 




 Ha, ha oh sorry :D 




 That's sad. It really is a reminder of how there are people who suffer from war that have nothing to do with it. 




 And America should recognise the mistakes they made in WWII. I do know that Japan did some awful, awful stuff during the war (I'm not Japanese) Some of it was, indescribably disgusting but that was almost a century ago. We shouldn't let the past go but we should remember, learn an  move on to our futures with a little more insight. 




 What was your favourite serious? Mines was the original one, with ti and Matt etc 




 I love the clarinet, it has a great sound. If you know how to play it still you shouldn't let it slip away. Buy one and just play when you have time then you won't lose your talent. 




 I want a woman who is funny, kind and caring. She wants kids and is also pretty social. I hope she gets along with my family. As far as looks go it's not a huge deal but I like long brown hair, Brown eyes. Race and skin colour etc isn't an issue. I'd like her to keep herself clean. I mean most people do but when people don't wash it's just disgusting. Weight I prefer skinny but I don't mean like girls on tv skinny that's just wrong I mean a normal real life weight that's healthy not an eating disorder. 




 You should come to Scotland I've seen women like that. 




 I used to love Digimon, I actually researched the entire series last year :) 




 My friend, let's call him Bob, stayed one time. He always said he had night terrors. I always thought he was joking since he's pretty funny and always laughed when he spoke about it. Anyway he stayed and after he fell asleep he woke up but his eyes were shut and he was crawling around my room screaming then he tried to crawl downstairs. I didn't want him to get hurt but I also didn't want to wake him because it can be dangerous so I tried guiding him back to my room before he just kind of collapsed back in to sleep. It was only about two years ago.  




 Ok here's what to do:

1. Set aside time, a lot of time over the next two weeks

2. Get past papers, either from school or online

3. Make a time table to follow.

4. Start by trying a past paper. Study for a while (a few days) but make sure when your studying you take regular breaks and don't get to worked up. Then after studying try the past paper again and see what score you got compared to the first time. Let's you know if/that you are improving and where you need to work one. 




 I love their songs. I don't really hear of them here but I found out about them through the theme song for the big bang theory about eight years ago an  I've loved them since. 




 I like saying random stuff which just confuses people before they laugh because what I said was so random or over the top that they can't hold it in but I'm not a hilariously funny person, however, I do get quite a few laughs. 




 Ha, ha /u/SketchyJJ berta lovejoy is hilarious! 




 I personally play the piano, keyboard and drums. I enjoy playing lots of songs on each but here is my list:

Piano - I enjoy playing the caprices of paganini.

Keyboard - a whole new world from Aladdin.

Drums - mostly rock songs from the 80's but I don't have a favourite.  




 Ha, ha by mentioning it, like everyone else has, we can expect it in half a century. 









 Boom. They were dead  




 Gets remastered. Then... 




 I've heard it happy but I like the sad version. I like the bagpipes but even as a Scotsman I don't hear them too often, normally only on special occasions.  




 Hey so jefe, Scottish guy here. The bagpipes are Scottish you were right and some of us did want to be independent. He'll I hate having the English anywhere near me. There were videos of our votes being rigged and still they wouldn't do a recount. I fucking hate those bastards, please do some reading before assuming we just turned it down because every person I know wants independence! 




 Ha, ha I just saw this and felt drawn to it since I'm scottish. Yeah amazing Grace sounds beautiful in a sad way. 




 Book: 

Harry potter and the chamber of secrets when Harry and the others are in the wrong place at the wrong time

Gone (my favourite book series):

In book 5 when Diana gives birth to gaia and she becomes a killing machine so fast.

Hunger Games catching fire when katniss fails to show her love to peeta to snow. I prefer the book series to the movie but the movies were pretty good.



Movie: Finding Nemo 

When marlin drops the mask.

Game: Telltales the walking dead. ***SPOILERS***

When, in season 1, Lee gets bit. I have played a lot of games, I mean a lot and these are the only two that have made me cry.

Also in season two when Rebecca dies and she tries to eat her baby and then the Russian gang attack and we don't know untill episode five who lived and who died!!

Tv series: Buffy the vampire slayer season 1 finale

When Buffy died for like two minutes and then she had an amazing sequence where she was walking with a smile on her face to the theme song before killing the master.

The walking dead show: ***SPOILERS***

Basically every episode but to be specific season 3 episode 4: killer within. Lorri goes into Labour right when a bunch of walkers try and attack the group and then she later dies :) 




 Don't worry about it I'm 16 and I've never drank alcohol. I've never been high either but that's cause, not to judge you but, I'm against drugs. Of course alcohol is a drug of sorts but back to your question. Anyway if you really want to try being drunk don't get pressured into it and don't hide it from your mum and dad. In December my family had a kind of party, my mum has lots of brothers and sisters so there were a ton of us. She said to me:

"(Insert my name here) if you want to have a couple of beers tonight don't get embarrassed or ask anyone else to buy you one. Come to me and I'll get you them". 

I never did it but I liked that I was aloud. She said to me soon after if I want to drink I can have some friends over, not  a party or anything (I really don't enjoy parties so that's fine) but just you and your friends (she said their names but I have around 4 close friends here outside my twin. I have others but they're the ones I always talk to.

I went off subject there, sorry, anyway my point was if you want to drink try not to worry about it to much. I suggest you say to your parents or whoever you live with, let's pretends it's your mum:

Hi mum, is it ok if (just say a couple, three at most, of people's names) come over tonight and have a couple of beers?,

She might say no at first but just explain to her that it's better if you have a drink at home where she knows what's going on rather than walking around the streets drunk, that should make her come around.

I've worried to that if I drink I'll say something I regret but I guess I'll try it when I'm ready but since you are ready, good luck.

Also I know I said  it but don't be pressured into it. 




 Wow! That was beautiful. I never expected anything like that. I really have to applaud you. The ending was sad but with a re-read there were hints and the fact that it seemed so *real* is a great bonus. If I never  knew that you had just written that you could put it in a history book and throw a name or two on it and I'd certainly believe it was from the time. 




 Ha, ha I love south park!! :D 




 He was hired 




 Good luck man, I'm doing this for myself, my future and religion. Everyone here's pretty supportive good luck. 




 Because they felt 




 A smaller bear

 Wrecked. 

I watched wreck it Ralph. 




 Ha, ha thank you? I guess. I love writing but every now and then I enjoy doing little joke stories like this and I couldn't help myself but I do like the idea of Ronald and the burger king. 




 Just incase you misunderstood I'm setting this during the Irish potatoe famine. 




 Ha, ha sorry about that. What do you think was wrong with my version? Was it all the farting, oh or the ending? 




 There once was a land that housed a man,

The man was a king, a burger king.

This man was loved by all,

Which would lead to his eventual downfall...


Our tale begins in the land of resturantante in the year of 1397AD. The land was happy and the king was beloved by all. One day King Burgerton the sixth was at chess with his beautiful wife sal-ad when his young, promising jester Ronald of house McDonald strolled through the door with a grin on his face and a twinkle in his eyes.

"Ah, young Ronald" said the king

"My Lord" he replied with a slight hint of laughter in his voice "m'lady" 

"Might I ask what's so funny young Ronald?" Ask the king

"Why yes, you may" then out of nowhere young Ronald leaped from where he stood and farted on lady sa-lads face, a little bit of crap came out too.

Ronald held his side with laughter

"Aaaaaugh, aaaaaauuuuuuuuugggggghh!!!" Screamed the queen

"Ronald!! My queen are you ok?" asked the king

"I shall never be clean again!!" She stood from her seat and ran to the window before jumping to her death.

Soon after the king became a ruthless and unjust man. He banned all cola and wouldn't allow any extra sauce!! He tried to kill young Ronald himself but the lad escaped.

Ronald went on to form his own kingdom of monopolyow. Through time it grew, they struggled at first attacks from dragons were a regular occurrence but before Ronalds 300th birthday his kingdom was striving. King budgeting heard of this kingdom and he wondered how a young, immature jester had accomplished such a feat. Straight away he declared war against the kingdom. 

The war was long and unforgiving. Winters dragged on and summers seemed to span a lifetime. Yet the war continued. Eventually young Ronald came up with a cunning plan. He had a wicked sorceress temporarily disguise him as the king from the distant land of pizzerianton, Lord hut. He arrived and king burgerton greeted him happily before Ronald, still disguised farted on his face and chopped of his head.



The end. 




 Ha, ha I'm sorry ;) (but seriously I'm sorry) 




 Ha, ha don't worry when I said it was rare I meant very rare like very, very rare. Don't worry you won't be using your mouth as a butt anytime soon :) 




 Yes, it's very rare. When you swallow food it goes through the process of peristalsis which is basically (the very short version) going in one side and comming out the other. This rare disorder waits till your food reaches the end of the process and basically turns around fixing EVERYTHING back up. It will likely never happen to you but if it does it will only happen once.  




 Ha, ha I was going to say this has been posted a million times. My username is XboxG4mer because I love xbox!! :) 




 And reverse peristalsis is just shitting from your mouth :) 




 Nice :)  




 Great question! I would make it... a diamond, I think since they are very difficult to break and I would likely hide it in a desert or a Forrest. I would kill my father (I'd rather not say why). 














 I love flying. It's great to look out of the window and see the ground hundreds of feet beneath you.  I lov  taking off, landing and everything about it. You don't get any special feeling but I reccomend you try it one day. 




 Sorry but what is this. 




 It would vary. Before nofap at some points I would do it a few times a day or just once  or twice a week. 




 I'm not in anyway saying that she represents the entire culture but they are very heavily oppressed but know no other way of life so simply accept it. 




 That was an interesting read, I'm not from the US so I never knew that they never taught that over there.  




 Ha, ha you're happy because you can be but you're unhappy because you shouldn't be able to be :D 




 I have spoken with a north Korean woman, she said they have almost no freedom and that's the way they were brought up so they don't understand the concept of freedom, therefore they can't value it. They are taught that the authorities are in charge, what they say goes. No one would dare speak out against it or rebel in anyway because they have no way of doing so and no one would ever speak of such things.  




 I understand that completely. I love having my views challenged, cause like you said it strengthens them or opens you up to new ideas. Again, like you, I love science. Especially biology and chemistry but for whatever reason people don't always like science and religion being paired but I've  never had any trouble in that department, well at least not anything serious.  




 What do you mean the freedom is going away? I'm from Scotland and I understand why you would care about freedom since its something virtually everyone values, at least those that have it do. I can't imagine people in north Korea valuing their "freedom" very much. 




 Good luck man that's rough but at least you're not going to binge or mope over it. Failure doesn't have to be bad as long as we learn from it.

 Repost! I wrote this yesterday!! :( 




 Not really, that's when we were conceived not born and we track the days from birth. I guess you're right in a sense. 









 Yeah we all know this is a repost. 









 No, I feel like it would drive me mad trying to prevent it or worrying about how close it is or isn't. I'd rather just leave it the way it is. 




 Ha, ha oh my god I have to make another variation of this and stick it in every bathroom I know of! 




 April fools! 




 So those who help keep reddit going can't use it? 









 So, Cinderella, do you deny the charges of murder of Sir Prince Charming in the 1st degree set against you here today' asked Far, far aways Totalitarian ruler the queen of hearts, who was foreseeing the case... 




 I know it's April fools and all but I wouldn't wear that even if  you paid me!! :D 




 'So, Cinderella, do you deny the charges of murder of Sir Prince Charming in the 1st degree set against you here today' asked Far, far aways Totalitarian ruler the queen of hearts, who was foreseeing the case... 




 Wow! I never thought about that before. 




 Damn!! 




 Damn it! The only flaw in an otherwise perfect plan! 




 Oh my god you actually did this!! Yay!! What do you think the general reaction will be to your new movie, especially after the success of the original? 




 Ok here goes:

Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there was a boy. A boy just like any other, except for one small difference. He was an egg. His name was humpty. Humpty lived with his mother and father, both loved their son very much, however, his parents were human. This made humpty feel very self conscious and confused since he was the only egg in the neighbourhood that people wouldn't eat, of course this was a positive in his books. He didn't want to be boiled, mashed or scrambled.

One day humpty came home from school and when he walked into his house he saw something that made his eyes yolk. His mother, snow white, was lying on the floor with blood oozing, slowly, from the back of her head. Behind her stood Doc, an enraged, heroine addicted dwarf. He stared straight at humpty, there could be no witnesses! Doc threw himself towards humpty who narrowly dodged doc and his incoming hammer, the same hammer that had just beaten his mother.

Humpty ran from his home and into the deep dark forrest. Doc was still following him, he threw the hammer straight into humpty's back. Yolk began pouring from humpty's bumhole.

 ***6 months later*** 

'Do you Doc, dwarf of house white, understand the accusations put forth against you by Prince, Wilfred charmingDumpty the third and his son Humpty Dumpty?' Asked the queen of hearts who was judging the murder trial which had unfolded after snow whites death.

'I do and I deny each and everyone of them. I would never murder snow white! She was my friend, and sometimes more if you know what I mean' he winked this last sentence which enraged Prince charming who soon tried to attack his wife's killer

'Order! Order I say!!' Yelled the queen. After things settled down the queen continued.

'Doc, can you explain the giant crack on this poor eggs anus?' She asked while she held back a laugh.

'I, eh... are you serious?' He replied

'Yes, quite serious'

'I don't anything about said crack'

'Doc, by denying the charges put forth against you, you are proving not only that you are terrible at lying but that you...' doc sniggered

'Excuse me' said the queen 'might I ask what you find so funny?'

'Yes, ha, ha' he said grabbing his sides 'you said but, ha, ha!!'

'Fuck this' she said agitated 'doc, you have pissed me offer you silly little junky, we have indisputable proof that you murdered snow white, by denying it you have angered me. Off with his head!!'

'Shit' said Doc as he was carried away.

Humpty and Prince charming walked out of the court house victorious.

'How do you feel knowing justice has been served?' Asked Cinderella of Fairy news 5

'I feel supercalifragilisticexpidaliotious' said both of them at the same time.





Sorry I never included more characters but that was fun.

 









 True but his name is Harvey dent 




 Lara's doppelganger from tomb raider underworld. She was made to be a villain and had no power over what she did, she was eventually freed by Lara though and managed to kill natla so she kind of redeemed herself. 




 I can't drive either, take a bus or train. I'm from Scotland and the buses and trains are a pretty good quality but I hear that's pretty bad in the US. 

To be honest I'm not a love expert, I'm kind of a nerdy guy but just ask her. I know it's easier said than done but force yourself to do it. 




 Great! Please, whatever you do ask her in person. Don't do it through text, it makes you look scared. 




 Just try hanging out with her first. 









 Ok, see I was worried that if she said no then her friends would find out and I'd be made fun of. Just do it. I wanted to for so long, it took me months but one day I woke up and said:

"Today's the day! I'm going to do it"

Just force yourself but no matter what don't do it in front of people and don't put pressure on her. If you do it in front of people she could get embarassed and say no.

Just say:

Hey [insert name of girl here] Do you want to hang out later? 

Or even just ask her to the movies. 

When you two are alone ask her. If she says yes don't brag about it, be happy obviously but don't ruin it by telling everyone straight away, wait till you're both ready. If she says no just ask her not to tell anyone.  




 I'd say don't force it. My old girlfriend and I were friends for years and one day I noticed how much I actually liked her. I was to shy to ask her out but eventually I made myself and she said yes. Ha, ha I remember after she went home I jumped around for ages screaming

 "yeeeeeeeeeeeessssssssssssssss" 

Anyway don't go out with a girl just to have a girlfriend, make sure you like her in that sense. 




 Computer programming?! Great! It's a growing industry, there are only going to be more and more jobs in that department. Follow it, if you think you can do it. Make sure you do enjoy it though, you don't want to be miserable doing something you hate. 




 In school what is your favourite class, what do you look forward to. 




 Well I don't have a gf right now because I moved a while back so me and my, at the time girlfriend had to split up. 

To stop playing games I found something that would motivate me. History. I want to be a history teacher and I would rather have a nice future than a lifetime of games. 

Just find that thing that motivates you to stop.  




 Ha, ha the day after I could barely keep my eyes open :D I do want to go places in life though and playing games won't get me there, studying will, so even though it was hard I'm happy to do this but during the summer holidays I'm going to play again :)  




 I would occasionally (during holidays or weekends) do 24 hour game sessions with friends. Now I'm happy with just a few hours because I know it's better in the long run. 




 Now I'll play for maybe an hour or two on Saturdays and Sundays but I used to play for a minimum of six per day. 




 I still play my xboxes but only for short periods of time, not like my old hours a day. 




 Oh, I hate CoD. 




 I'm doing 5 subjects next year and they're what I'm going to study. An hour and a half of each subject per day means around 7 and a half hours a day. With a break or two of course. 




 Oh me too I'm a much bigger DC fan than Marvel 




 I haven't quite finished it yet but when I submit it I'll come back here and tell you :) 




 Who? 




 I built agrabah from Aladdin. I made my INterior look like the palace and I even built the cave of wonders. Inside it is a big platforming challenge, at the end you can save genie and get some treasure. I built the marketplace and even Aladdins "home". Remember his place where he looks at the palace. 









 You have to want to. What do you want to be. I used to just lay around playing xbox, I always wanted to be a doctor but I stopped and asked myself what do I really want out of life? I decided that I wanted to be a history teacher since I love the subject and for other reasons. Any way now I study way more, I used to study for a while each night now I'm going to study for six hours a day for the next 3 weeks. Set a goal and work towards it. 
























 [This!](http://www.ratemypoo.com/) 




 I like it. Then there's the issue of obscurity. The aldmeri dominion is the only "alliance" which remains after the interegnum. This is easily dismissed as it is known that the alliances fell apart when Talos took control but why were they never, ever mentioned in any lore book? Surely someone would have written about the pact or covenant. 




 I always here about full moons and new moons etc and yes the game does have a lunar cycle and from what I can tell it increases their chances of spawning but they can and do spawn no matter the moon phase. 

I am a werewolf and was bitten by an npc wolf the night after a new moon. I have seen countless wolves and blood fiends virtually every night. Lunar cycles don't matter! 




 For example, it was said that Cyrodiil used to be a jungle province until Tiber Septim reigned and leveled it during his conquering of tamriel. Yet in the game it is just as it was in oblivion.

 




 Don't get me wrong I love eso and I love the entire series but zenimax did screw up some of the lore, sure they tried to explain it but the only people that buy it are those that have never played any other games in the series. 

If you played and completed Daggerfall then you will remember that there were multiple endings to the story, Bethesda made it so they all happened, technically. Using a dragon break they made it so it was possible that any of them could have happened. 


Any way Bethesda could use a dragon break to explain the faults in the lore in the next game.
 




 Do you believe that we are better than other species? 




 I wonder, if you believe in evolution, if web will evolve any further as we no longer have a need. When animals change climate etc they evolve to survive there but we don't. We, rather than say growing fur, build a house and put a heater inside. 




 I maybe wasn't clear. I mean are we above other species or equal? Read [this](http://www.scottishpoetrylibrary.org.uk/poetry/poems/basking-shark) 

The poet questions if we're justified in thinking that were above all others and wonders this because we have done so much damage whereas animals, like the basking shark, don't cause any trouble yet we think we're better than them. 




 Do you think we're above all other species? Do you think we're too arrogant? Do you believe in basic human goodness? Are we all "evil" inside? Tell me your thoughts. 




 I am young but since I was younger than I can remember I always wanted to be a medical doctor. I was inspired by my doctors who I saw regularly because of asthma and my twins doctors as he has cerebral palsy (only slightly). 

Anyway I truly believed that's what I wanted untill only recently when I sat and really thought about where I was headed in life. I considered archaeology as history is my favorite subject and I could talk about it forever. Then I spoke with archaeologists and spent time in their company it was... enjoyable but not for me. Then it occurred to me - - history teacher. And I'm now working towards that goal.  




 ENGLAND! 




 There are 10 types of people in this world: those who understand binary and those who don't. 




 "There are many fates worse than death". This can also be said for murder and crimes. 

Take rape for example. Let's say a woman is raped she will likely have a very difficult time recovering from the physical and mental trauma and even then she will have a tough time getting intimate with someone. It can often ruin lives.

Then again look at child abuse-be it physical, mental or sexual. I read a book once about a young boy in the states. The name currently alludes me. I don't generally read these kinds of books but it came recommend to me by a family member and it was relatively short. 

It told the (true) story of a young boy who's mum started abusing him. He stressed how she and his father had once loved him and his brothers but the father began to drink and the mother began to abuse only him. She would beat him, starve him, force him to do things no person, let alone child should have to do. 

This is evil. To do this to anyone is wrong but child abuse is simply evil.

 




 I don't care it doesn't hurt me but it gets annoying all of the shit on tv and the internet.  




 Oh I loved her this season. Especially when she was writing "space hump chronicles" :D 




 Oh, sorry never thought of that. Of course I'll do it now. 




 Oh I agree, I always wondered about her. 




 Victims: 

Tell us what happened. Who bullied you (avoid real names). Did you and your bully ever make amends?


Bullies:

Why did you bully people? What happened? Did you ever make amends?
 




 Awesome, I never even thought to check for that sub reddit. 




 God this has been asked a million times! I like xbox. 




 I actually haven't checked, weirdly cause I absolutely love it!! 









 Is it ok if I roofie you? 




 You can't play as them in the standard edition so it's more of a status thing. 




 Well they're special because they were playable in all past games but due to the storyline they're kind of different due to the fact that the three alliances are fighting for control over their land -- Cyrodiil.

As for you wanting to go to borrowings you will have to reach level 50. Since you chose the Daggerfall covenant you begin in their controlled area. At level ten you get cyrodiil and as you progress you get more of your own controlled land but at level 50 the entire Mao will become traversable. 




 Hey all, me and my friend play on the European server and would love some players to play with. We're both from scotland and are open to voice chat. Both of us have played plenty of elder scrolls in the past so we know the lore.


We play in the ebonheart pact. I am a female dark elf and he is a male nord. I mainly focus on magic (dark magic, daedric summoning and storm calling). He is a nightblade who focuses on close combat (siphoning, assassination and shadow). We would like a cleric of sorts but we honestly don't care what you play as or focus on we just want to have fun completing the dungeons and playing the game. Also we don't care what level you are.


If you want to play with us feel free to message me on Xbox:


Devlin Fr3w99


I hope some of you get in touch but if not I hope you have fun playing anyway. 









 Don't reset after a wet dream. You can't control them but don't continue after you wake  up. Just let them pass and they'll stop. 




 s. puedo cambiar mi acento cuando hablo en lnea con amigos que viven en otros lugares , por ejemplo en Xbox 




 You too friend :) 




 Ja, ja , eso es gracioso cuando la gente no entiende . A menudo sucede debido a mi acento 




 Escocia. De donde eres? 




 Buenas fiestas a todos! 




 Tres bien merci. Qu en pensez-vous? 




 Ha, ha I love how you guys can have bbqs year round. I have family who emigrated there around ten years ago and they absolutely love it. 




 Ha another scot happy eater :) 




 It's up near the top right. It says start a conversation. 




 Ha, ha oh my god that's bad. Good luck explaining to him. 




 And to you! :) 




 Hi, I can give you a pretty great one, in my opinion anyway. I was a kid when I heard of this and it scared me for weeks but not so much anymore.

It's called: "Kuchisake Onna". It's an urban legend about a woman who's husband became increasingly jealous of her infidelity, he thought she was cheating. So he decided to take her beauty away from her by slitting her mouth from ear to ear giving her a permanent "smile", much like the joker in batman. He then killed her and she became a ghost.

I read about it in detail when I was younger it's kind of interesting.

I won't write the whole story but if you think it sounds good you can read it [here](http://creepypasta.wikia.com/wiki/Kuchisake-Onna) but that version is pretty short. 




 Wow we like a lot of the same areas of history. I suggest you go down to your nearesg library and go to the history section. I still love doing that. You can find some great stuff on almost all of the areas you listed. If you want me to list books I will happily. 




 It's Easter here in Scotland. 




 Aaaw but at least she learned how to lock pick. 




 Even though this is funny your forgetting that 2013 was a prequel to all oth e  games so she's is older on the right and is looking at the left and saying it's hideous. 




 Ha, ha! :D I love tomb raider and don't get me wrong this is funny but it was not fast! She changed gradually and her peak was around underworld but in 2013 and rise of the tomb raider she looks amazing! 




 Ok that sounds like fun. 




 Or Passover or whatever you celebrate at this time of year. I hope you enjoy your day/week.  




 Wow. I hope everything turns out ok OP. Update us soon, if it's not to inconvenient. I know you have said on multiple occasions that you have renounced god and Jesus but, if it's ok with you, I  like to say a prayer for you and your daughter? (Don't worry I won't write it :) )  




 Thanks for that but I don't think it's that since that headache was very short and according to that they last pretty long. 

I think I might've over reacted cause today it's not nearly as bad as it was. When I shake my head now it hurts a bit but I think it'll go away. If it doesn't go away within a couple of hours I'll go to a doctor just to be safe. 




 Why get the money in gbp? 




 Ha, ha I was sorted into ravenclaw on pottermore and every quiz and reading the books I always related to ravenclaw more than any other house. 




 That way you'd make it to 65 at least. 




 Northeast Africa, southwest Asia. 




 If you give up ten you would live up to at least 75, not bad. 




 So I woke up and I never noticed immediately but my left I was pretty sore. Yesterday I got a very short headache (incase it's related). 

I can't stand up fast or move my head fast without pain. It's at the back of my eye and its pretty painful whenever I move too fast. It hurts the back of the eye and the top of my head. 

Also earlier I saw some parts of my eyesight as blurry, kind if hard to describe. I had to really focus to see certain things. For example look straight ahead then very slightly down and to the right. I couldn't see there. 

I haven't been to the opticians in a while but I'm going soon please tell me if this is serious. 




 No, I meant after giving away one year you get a total of one million after giving up two you have a total of two, not three if you know what I mean? I understand how you thought I meant what you did.  




 Ha, ha :) it would be hard to end your life younger than it should be for something as, fake? As money but you have to admit it's importance in our world so I'd give  up maybe one year. 




 That makes sense you get 4m and still reach 80 years or so. Pretty decent. 




 That's reasonable. 




 So what would you trade knowing you'll love to 85 before you gave away any years? 




 Yeah let's just assume you will at least reach 85 and you will still be ignorant to the date  and year 




 Ok that's reasonable. 




 45 is still pretty young and fifteen years is a long time. I don't think I could ever give that up. 




 It's absolute so you can't like invest it then buy extra years and still be to h. When the trade is done its done. 




 Let's just say you will reach age 85 before you make the trade. 




 Do you mean 3 years or 2 million? 




 I think I'd say that too. So much can happen in a year but maybe I'd give up one  of my older, older years. 




 Yeah sure, half a year = half a million. Not to bad. 




 Wow, that was... disturbing? 




 ***EDIT 1*** Lets just assume that you will live untill you turn 85 years old and then after that you can die at any point. So you could die straight away or live another 20 years. It is absolute so when you make the trade it's done for good. 




 Not black per say. They weren't white or black they were a dark tan shade. Closer to black than white but kind of middle eastern looking, which makes since they live in the mid east.  




 I believe so. During the Scottish wars of independence William Wallace fought for our country (please don't take  everything you know of him from the movie braveheart as it is very historically inaccurate). Here he was considered a hero. He helped rid the country, temporarily, of English rule. However, in England he was considered a terrorist.



So to answer your question I think yes but it's very dependent. I do think it's rare however as most terrorists are unjustified and cruel but then again it depends on what you consider a terrorist. 

 




 I think smart phones. Using face time or even just calling someone would amaze them. 




 They've all had pretty terrible deaths, sad. 




 Half of us (Scottish people) are gladly run by fucking English dicks! I hate the English government and want to be  independent but we're the only country to have turned it down while others die for it. 




 Look at the people in the background, it's a painting. 




 I know what you mean but everyone should be able to love their country without shame. When I leave my country for long periods I start missing it a lot. It's this love for a country and everyone deserves to have this. I don't run around shouting woohoo Scotland!! But I do like knowing that I can be and am proud to be from here.  




 Easter :) Enjoy your week  




 The other day I wrote a post which someone reposted an  I see stuff like this all the time. Why do you guys do it? 




 Yeah cause this isn't a repost 




 That's horrible. You've lived quite a life and I wish you many more years of happiness and joy. 




 I'm sorry you all have to feel that way for what happened in the past. It's not your fault nor your grandmas. I hope one day soon Germany will get its patriotic pride back. 




 That's sad. I've read of people losing their entire life savings. Can I ask, if you don't mind, what he felt, thought or said when the new rentenmark came to be and he knew his money would never be worth anything again? 




 Not German but I've studied this in depth. Her answer will be better if they get a chance to answer you since there are so many comments.

Many people were against Jewish people even before the war, they were thought of as "the old enemy of Germany". Hitler, being a master of propaganda, used this hate for his own good. He made the Germans and anyone who opposed him look weak, greedy and selfish, only caring about themselves rather than the greater good of Germany.

Hitler was also very good to the German people. He provided free day trips and helped end poverty in Germany almost every person of age had a job of some sort. 

People never saw him as evil because he did things that were good for them and his speeches were very hypnotic, in a sense that he was a great speaker. You also have to remember that he came to power during a very tough time for Germany so they got on board with some of his more radical policies. 

Many people were ok with what was going on with the Jews because of their pre existing hatred for them and the propaganda that they couldn't escape. That's not to say some people weren't opposed to what was going on but speaking out was dangerous.

There are detailed cases of people being against Hitler's ways. One woman who's name alludes me made brochures of sorts and handed them out but she was only one woman and brochures took a long time to make. Communists were against him but like the Jews they were imprisoned and anyone else who had any doubts kept them mostly to themselves for fear for what would happen to them or their loved ones. 

If they wanted a peaceful life in Nazi Germany they wouldn't speak against anything. They would hail Hitler when they passed in the streets, they would have a copy of his book "mein kampf" on their table when they were having company and they would make sure their children attended the youth programmes put in place by Hitler. 




 Your grandma seems like a great woman. I only have a couple of questions:

Did she join/was she forced to join the league of German maidens

What did she think of the state of Germany post wall street crash 1929? And then what did she think after Hitler rose to power and provided the country with his new social, economic and political policies? 




 Wow. Great job she sounds like a real bitch. I love how you handled the whole thing. 




 I think your dead... to your wife.

Just kidding go and talk to her and see why she did it. 




 Wow. What a beautiful painting. 




 Are you from the US cause it's supposed to be very, very common there. 









 What the fuck! Jesus Christ that's just wrong! Tell them no. 




 Prostitute 














 Yes!! I knew it. I knew I wasn't a sleeper agent! 




 I've the idea but I think th  game would be better with your story and character creation etc but with maybe 4-8 player co-op rather than a full blown mmo. 




 I see a map. 




 I say bith. I just kind of say them as they happen but I think most commonly I say day-tuh. 




 Happy Passover to all of you who celebrate it :) 




 How do I know I'm not a Russian sleeper agent??  




 Ha, ha now I'm scared. How do you know I'm not a Russian sleeper agent? 




 Wow! They are so lucky to be alive. Hopefully they'll learn to drive a bit slower. 




 Ha, ha I guess I never thought about where you live :) 




 I always thought they were like earth popping a spot. 




 Oh yeah! I never noticed that before. 




 Not necessarily. If I saw you now and said goodbye then died on my own in my house it would likely be a family member who would see me dead first. 




 Ha, ha don't worry about it :) 

I've always wanted to visit the US since I've  been all around Europe. I'd like to go to NYC, California (LA), Florida and a few other states. 

Have you been anywhere outside of the US 




 It will never happen were they are all immune to antibiotics but if it did most of humanity would die out and the ones who survived would have stronger immune systems than ever before after years of adapting but still life would be a pretty huge fight. 




 No I just say a prayer at night time, oh I meant pray ha, ha autocorrect. 




 I go to chapel when I can but I don't force it, I prey in times of need and thanks (I normally prey every night). Online I try not to say or do anything I wouldn't do offline and then the rest of my day is just a normal day by all standards. 




 Those that know binary and those that don't! 




 Well quite a lot of them are younger gamers who weren't playing games when they were released and so they never played them. Then they see people doing it on the internet and they've heard of the game so they just go along with it. 




 I don't know any racists per say. I've heard people say a racist remark every now and then but they've straight away apologised and you can tell it is a genuine apology. I'm white but I have many friends of different races. Skin colour isn't a choice, the way you act is. 

It's pretty incredible to see how far the US has come. This time 50 odd years ago black people were considered to be disgusting sub humans. I mean it should never have been like that but at least the problem has been mostly rectified. 




 Wow that's a great find. I can't imagine how horrible life was like for most African Americans in those times. It messed many of them up socially and economically for life and for their generations to come. 




 Yeah I love it here. Like most people my country is the best in the world ;) in my opinion. Yeah it's nice, good cities nice countrysides and it's a generally friendly country. 




 Yeah but when shortened it is common to put WWII for world war two as the II is the Roman numeral for two. 




 You are inconsistent. 




 Ha, ha apparently so. I'm from Scotland it's not nearly as common here. 




 Sorry that is terrible but why did you put IIWW rather than WWII? 
























 I agree. But I loved the cross-over episodes! I just found Angel to be to brooding. 




 Ha, ha my first name is Devlin but I figured that I'd put my username. 




 Okay, thank you :) 




 So what does this have to do with the mandela effect? 









 When I was a kid my family and I moved to the countryside. For the first four years we lived in a small town which was fine but we eventually moved, quite litterally to the middle of nowhere. It was this one street town with like 4 houses. It was ok because I spent most of my time indoors anyway (I've always been indoors-ey).
The house we were living in was big, much bigger than anything I had ever stayed in before (before we moved to the countryside we lived in a suburban area of a city with a pretty big home, then a small town, then the middle of nowhere). Most of the bedrooms were upstairs but there was one down stairs. Everytime you went in it it was cold, when I say cold I mean it felt like ice, you could always see your breath. So, as a rule, I stayed out of there. The rest of the house was awesome and my brothers and sisters and I had a pretty cool time living there but I started getting horrible feelings whenever I went near the cold room:
My eyes would water like I was going to cry, I would get a sore chest. I always tried to keep myself calm by explaining to myself that it was just me, I got a sore chest because of my asthma, I had watery eyes because of some other reason I'm sure I found less than convincing.
The part that gets creepy was when our kitchen was being remodeled. Because of the layout of the kitchen we had to move the fridge into the cold bedroom untill the remodelling was finished. I couldn't stand going in there and eventually I straight out refused. You see I spend a lot of time with my two dogs (who were younger at the time) since I'm almost always inside and whenever they went near that room they would show their teeth and raise their hackles, which they virtually never do.
One night I fell asleep and had this nightmare. In it I went into the room to get something as fast as I possibly could but then the door slammed shut and I couldn't open it for the life of me. On the other side my brother was trying to force it open. Then this man appeared he was clothed in a huge black cloak and started mumbling words I couldn't make out before he started choking me. I woke up coughing like mad and had, what I call, a "mini" asthma attack. I told my mum the next morning and she starred as if looking through me not at me. Then she said:
'XboxG4mer I had the exact same dream'
She never wanted to freak me out so straight away she comforted me by telling me it was just a dream. I kept having the same nightmare and I never asked her but I think my mum did too because after a couple of months we moved away.
The man in the dream was old but looked wholly evil. I don't know what happened in that house but there was something about that room. Nothing could warm it and the eery sensations I got when near it were stronger than any I've ever felt. 




 The protagonist(s) survive the impossible. 









 Eeh that's the subreddit for the show. 




 Ha, ha okay 




 I like that too. I don't live in the states so it's nice to speak to others that do. Or anywhere else really. 









 I used to bite my nails a lot. The best thing you can do is cut them with scissors or nail clippers and keep them short by cutting regularly that way you won't be able to bite them and eventually you won't want to because you'll be used to keeping them short using other means.  




 Awesome I'll check it out :) 




 Awesone I just messaged you :) 




 I'll invite you too a group and we can meet at the shrine in the rift. 




 Awesome if you're on now I'll do it :) 









 Orange is the new black. Oh my god amazing show can't wait for s4. 




 Love it! What did you think of the ending? I called it years ago and when I was right I felt kinda sad. I did like the ending though it was realistic. 




 Angel isn't nearly as good imo. I always found him to brooding. 




 Ha, ha one month! Amateur, week and a half here. I watched them wiithout stopping except for the wee hours of sleep that I got. 




 Username: DevlinFr3w99 

I'm up for talking about xbox, gaming, books, music, tv and movies.  




 Awesome! You're so lucky! 




 It's a matter of opinion. It's a difficult game which is good imo but the world doesn't pull me in like other games. I had fun with it but in my opinion it's not that great but I can see why some people like it. 




 Not buried, I read it :) 









 Try and draw a a sexy female poo, with long brown hair, glasses and a little black or red dress.

***EDIT 1:*** So a few of you said I should look into it and see what I can find. When I did a quick google of the street it turned up nothing and gave me the names of nearby locations. I'll update again soon.

***EDIT 2*** So I found it on the googs (sounds weird, google sounds better). However it only spoke about how the "village" once had a larger population, a school and a train station etc but after the coal mining industry in the area was done many people moved and full streets lay empty. I knew all of this and when I say full streets I mean like 15 houses maybe 20, barely anyone lives there today. 




 Wow. That's an awesome story. Kudos to you and your brother for keeping calm. Is he still serving? Have you since gone camping in that area?  




 How many steps have I taken in my entire life? 

How many people have there been since the dawn of time? 




 Don't ever talk about tucking snails! They're evil and terrifying! 




 Free will. I wondered about this a long time ago and aske  my self even though I technically could do anything I want is that my fate? To end up wherever I do because of what I do. So for a while I just did completely random, out of the ordinary things. I don't see any special results. Nothing monumental, good or bad happened and I don't see how it could lead me to my fate. We can do whatever we want. 




 It's a choice you can make just tell her your views on the matter. 




 I don't know about where you live but here it's a choic you can make when you turn eleven, regardless of what your parents say. 




 This is just a re-post of that post that said the same thing about the tallest person. It's kind of sad what people will do for karma. Also they might not have been since they may have been born fat and never experienced a skinny lifestyle. 




 No he wasn't. There would've been babies who were born that were smaller than him at birth. 









 How about we get married, in Summer, in a church in Antarctica? Then we jump into our sled pulled by dogs and go on a magical ride to Hawaii where we can enjoy our honeymoon? 




 Woohoo! We'll get married in winter in a church. You have to make me feel loved. 




 I'll do it for free in exactly 13 hours 24 minutes and 16 seconds if you're on the EU server 




 Marry me! 




 History. I could talk about it forever. I'm also deeply passionate about books and gaming. 




 It sounds really dangerous. Microwaves aren't safe when they have faults. They can cause various problems. I don't know exactly what's happening with your microwave but I definitely recommend that you get a new one.  




 Get rid of it and buy a new one, that sounds extremely dangerous.  




 Good for you, I never used socks but I now have tissues since joining 




 Aaw, that's too bad. 




 You are a good man. 




 I just want to say, I don't intend on trying it but I'm just curious. Please don't say 2/3 times. 




 After you eat anything wash the bowl/plate etc. It stops dishes from piling up.

Empty the trash frequently and taking shoes off at the front door is a good rule if you have carpets. 

Set aside a couple of hours one day a week and wash your windows and doors etc.

I realise they were more about keeping it clean. As for organisation:

Keep things in certain places. You keep your clothes in your wardrobe and dishes in the cupboard so do the same thing and set certain locations for certain things. 

A good I dea is a coat rack. Some can be bought that are pretty nice and they stop jackets from piling up.

 




 It is Harold. 




 Good for you man. Society does justify it way to much. Just cause it's "normal" doesn't make it good, slavery was once normal and so was burning people for being witches. I'm not comparing these three things just making a point. I've had a few times were I've made it for weeks but as far as porn goes I went months without it... untill recently. I still don't regret it though because I now know more than ever that I don't enjoy it or want to see it. Good luck friend. 




 Im a vorarephiliac. It involves people being eaten etc. You can read about it [here.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vorarephilia) 




 I think I was around ten. We enjoyed the entire day and in the night she came to see us. We were playing with our new toys and she asked if we had a good day? We answered "aye" (from Scotland :) ) we spoke for a while about how fun they were and then she told us gently. I can't remember exactly what she said but she did it right cause weren't upset or angry. At the time we were beggining to question Santa's motives for bringing us free stuff (kidding but we were at the age were you question his authenticity).  




 Yeah, I'm in a large group of people who roleplay as werewolves, we take it pretty seriously. There are even larger ones that do all sorts of things you just have to find them. 




 Green. Or bumpy. 




 When she figured we were getting to old my mum sat me and my twin down on christmas night and explained gently to us. It went really well and we understood. She did the same thing with my older siblings. 




 My sister's friend's cousin's girlfriend's mum's friend's nephew was in a photo of some sort that was used to represent some sort of product somewhere. 




 Yeah people on the internet always lie, I also have a 11" dick. Really!


If everyone that had said that did then the average would be 11" and it wouldn't be so special. 




 I saw it in a Matthew Santoro video on youtube. 









 Yeah, fun game. Don't get me wrong I like pc gaming but I just prefer consoles. 




 You are an extremely gifted writer. Most TIFU post with anything even remotely similar are people complaining or trying, and failing, to be funny. You made me laugh so much while I was reading. I hope your, eh little you, gets better fast. 




 Well it's better than playstation and I don't enjoy pc gaming. 




 I see them as a people with a nice cultural background who are often taken advantage of by other ethnic groups. 




 No. Even if the answer was yes, I would say aye. 




 Ha, ha oh my god that was great! Did you make it? If so well done. 




 All the time on xbox. I'm Scottish so I'm always asked if I wear kilts, have ginger hair, drink whiskey etc. 




 By British you probably mean English. I'm Scottish (technically British) and I can't stand those people or their terrible jokes. 




 What you have to first understand is that the government cannot just print money as it needs to have a value. Here in Scotland our money is worth sterling. So if we wanted we could go to a bank and request sterling (but no one does). Instead of everyone carrying said sterling we carry notes to represent them. 


So the government, here can print depending on the amount of sterling we have. If they print beyond what we have inflation occurs and prices rise. This was a major issue in Weimar Germany 1923 and again in 1929. 

So to answer your question: Governments can and should print within what they have, depending on what the currency represents.  




 Around a decade ago NASA sent a space probe, called new horizons, on a journey. It is now closer to Pluto than any man-made object has ever been and can take much better photographs than our current technology allows via the use of telescopes.  




 I do this but don't suck in too much :) 




 The breeze (Brianna) from the "GONE" [series](http://www.michaelgrantbooks.co.uk/gone/) by Michael Grant.


She and I were around the same age when I read it (14) and she was everything I liked in a girl. Long(ish) Brown hair, witty, smart, a little bit cocky. She was just an awesome, well written character and then...

***SPOILER ALERT***


































They killed her off in the most inhumane way possible! I still cry at night. (Joking) but seriously she was awesome.
 









 There's a very good theory that bypasses all of that. It's a bit far fetched but possible. 




 Good luck OP. Maybe it has something to do with your old arrowhead shaped rock. If you still have that I wouldn't throw it away. I would go back to the tunnel you mentioned at the first chance I got and leave it there. Either way stay safe.
 




 Wow, weird. To me it sounds like she was killing them and taking different parts of each mens body together to make one "perfect man". 




 I know it's late but I made it to the front page of askreddit and got over 10,000 messages and I can't clear them all or read my actual messages from other posts! 




 I know right! 




 I know I'm late but hopefully you will read this. First of all I'm sorry you guys can't have children. I think you should tell your mum to stop torturing you and your wife. I know it's not an easy thing to do, trust me it's not, but maybe you should give her an ultimatum. Tell her it's not Claires fault she can't have children and if she doesn't give you both a sincere apology and stop upsetting you both then you want nothing to do with her. I know that sounds like a terrible thing to say to her but she will most definitely choose you and I know it will cause friction and tension but another option is that you sit down with her and Claire and explain that adoption is in no way evil and tell her she needs to stop, this is no one's fault. 




 I love these so much!!!!!!!! 




 Aaaaagh Felix!! :D How much? Honestly how much?! 




 Ha, ha she's gorgeous! 









 Wow, all I can say is good luck and I hope you do complete it and manage to compete. 




 Ha, ha what a great and inspirational man. 




 I saw it. I like that one. 




 Ha, ha nice one. 




 I would replace it with [this.](https://m.youtube.com/#/watch?v=76RrdwElnTU) 




 Jafar from Aladdin. Sure he seems evil but if you think about it he is trying to save the kingdom from the idiot sultan who doesn't even notice the widespread poverty and famine in his own kingdom... and he's also trying to become an evil dictator but what's a little dictation amongst friends? 




 Ha! :D 




 That's a nice quote. You might've been late but I still read it :) 




 Yeah, no. 




 It doesn't have to just be in eso it can be from arena-daggerfall-morrowind-oblivion-skyrim-eso (also redguard and battlespire). 




 Yeah, no. 




 Either way I love him. He was so funny and during the planemeld he wanted to stop it, not to save nirn, but to "save" coldharbour from getting to much like tamriel.  




 I remember reading that post, sad for the guy but at least he probably inspired others to not make the same mistakes. 




 Me too :) 




 Ha, ha this made me laugh. 




 Wow good job :) (Not being sarcastic, seriously nice words). 




 I honestly can't remember who said it but I remember reading:


I am not a a pessimist for they look at the world with negative views and thoughts. Nor am I an optimist for they look at the world and often try and see the good where there is none. I am a realist. I am happy when things are good and face the hard times when they arrive. 


It wasn't that exactly but it was something like that. 




 I'm actually studying history and I love that quote, along with:

"History is not history, unless it is the truth":- Abraham Lincoln. 




 Ha, ha I used to, scrap that, I do love Rugrats! 




 WT?! 




 Ha, ha the end made me laugh :) I like that quote too. 




 Ha, ha this made me laugh. 




 I'll be back... to write some more Arnie quotes with you later and you better do it! 




 I like that :) 




 Okaaaaay. 




 Wai- wait what?! I blew up?! AAAAAGH!! :D I don't really use facebook. I have it but... meh. 




 Okaaaay. 




 I ***LOVE*** Mass Effect, great games, great quote :) 




 I think that's also the Nike slogan :) 




 I like that and I have to say, as a fellow gamer, I don't think it's wasting time. You're socializing, having fun and even though you might not realize it you learn quite a lot from videogames.  




 Ha, ha I might not have the power but I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't do drugs... I play video games aswell! As a fellow gamer with virtually no right to say this... I declare the above quote to be under permanent ownership by /r/Lizardizzle 




 Aaa thanks! 




 ***EDIT 1*** Wow! I just woke up and this post blew up!! Thank you all!! :D 




 Life would look bad since we see in much higher "fps" (of course life doesn't have frames but you know what I mean) 
























 I stayed lucid for, what felt like, hours. That's not a problem it's just control the dream and the environment. 




 Eviiiil!  




 In general, when you're at school or shopping or basically anywhere out of the house. 




 No, there's vehicles, you can explore pretty amazing maps and the areas aren't linear as you can tackle most using different means for example you could drive in and be loud or sneak in and be quiet. It's really fun! 




 Generally yes. Some people take 90 but it can take between 60 and 120. 




 How big of an inconvenience has having diabetes been for you? 




 YES! Halo has an incredible storyline and great characters!! One of my all time favourite games! 




 Kanye west, he'd make a HUGE deal about it!! 




 Ha, ha :) 




 Ha, ha if you look you can still see some people's faces!! 




 I never made the picture, just saw it online and grabbed it :( 









 Lets agree to disagree. 




 Structure yes, plot no. Structure- like you said smart and dumb physical and weak outcasts and have to work to get back on top yes but they have a different storyline and you're confusing that (plot) to be the same when it's the structure. 




 Like the lion king, frozen and the hunger games then. They aren't the same but have similar structure. 




 Ha! 




 Back then women were seen more as objects than people. They were there to feed the family, keep the house inviting and raise the children. Nothing more, they were essentially second class when compared to men. So it was thought that the younger the girl the more children she can have. 

This goes back further, if you look at ancient greece women were not to dabble in mens affairs (yet at the same time in troy women were living the life of luxury!!). 

Of course society progressed, things like medicine and science with it. It was realised a girl should be able to grow before birthing a child. Almost 100 years ago there were many womens rights movements like the suffragists and suffragettes. They campaigned for a womens right to vote. When they eventually gained this many continued to work after the war, even though many men thought they should be at home. It eventually became the womans choice if she wanted to work or if she wanted to give birth or both. 
 




 Not really. In MU they go to university because they're that age. In 21 js they go undercover. 




 Literature, ha! I never found that in-game, funny that they added it. 




 It's upbto you. To be honest I wouldn't get it permanently done. I pressume you're a woman? (Correct me if I'm wrong). If you shave I'd just stick with that cause you might want to grow it back in the future. But again, it's up to you. 




 Ha, ha! What game is this... eh I don't want to pl- play it. A friend asked me to ask you. Yea- yeah that's what happened a friend asked me to ask you. It was a friend... not me. A friend. 




 There's going to be a million "dick size" comments here. 




 Do reality checks throughout the day (I cover my nose and mouth) if you keep doing it you get in the habbit then if you do it in a dream you'll know you're dreaming. For example, I cover my mouth and nise but in dreams I can breathe when I do that so I realise I'm dreaming.

This [wikihow article](http://m.wikihow.com/Lucid-Dream) might help you. 

Keep a dream journal and when you wake, lie for a few minutes and think about your dream then write as many facts as you can remember down this will make future dreams more vivid.

Enjoy LD they are awesome!  




 Hey, I wrote a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/3ds0j8/i_want_to_lucid_dream_but_im_terrified_of_sleep/) yesterday, explaining that I was terrified of SP so I just wanted to say thank you to everyone who answered, I feel a lot less worried about it now.

So before I start I want to say I used to LD  as a child but never really knew how I was doing it or what was going on.

I had my first DILD (in years) last night. It was pretty cool, I was in water and realised I could breathe with my hand over my mouth and nose (my favourite reality check). I knew I was dreaming so I could now control myself but i couldn't control the area around me or do anything (like flying etc). Then I started doubting that I was dreaming and my mind kept going back and forth but I knew I was when I realised how weird my location was and that I could still breathe with my hand over my mouth. No other reality checks that I did worked (e.g putting my finger through my hand). Any way the dream lasted for a pretty long time which was cool but I was wondering how I can better control my environment in dreams and how I can do things like fly. I read that you just jump and imagine you're flying or close your eyes and imagine then when you open them you will but that never worked.

So how can I better control my dream environment?

Fly?
 




 Thank you!!  




 I actually managed to have a DILD last night when I did a reality check (covered my mouth and nose and could still breathe) no sleep paralysis!! Can you get SP through DILD or just WILD? I couldn't fully control the dream however. I could control me and knew I was dreaming but I couldn't change my surrounding (very easily) or fly etc. 




 Ha, ha!! :D 




 I managed to have an LD last night infact (no SP!!) But it was strange, I knew I was dreaming and could control myself but I couldn't controk the area around me or fly etc? 









 If thay happens you can forcefully wake yourself or make it change (difficult). 




 Lucid dreaming is when you realise that you are dreaming and can go on to control what happens in your dreams. People can train themselves to lucid dream by doing "reality checks" throughout the day. 




 r/casualconversation great bunch of people, very friendly. 




 Try taking a cold shower. I know it sounds taboo but it wakes you up, energizes you and makes you feel aware. Definitely worth trying but be careful if you have any breathing conditions. 




 If they gave consent before hand I don't see why not but if they have to get permission from their lawyers or they just do it it's unethical since the actor or actress may not have liked the project. 









 We aren't prepared. We aren't prepared!! What if they use a hoover?! Those damned feline fanatics might wish they were like our brethren but they have wits! We mustn't underestimate them! 




 Damn it! Get me dogfort we need to organise before an attack of this magnitude! 




 Wow. Sounds like there's something else. You handled it pretty good. When she cools down talk to her and see what she says. 




 But still what you're saying is wrong. 




 Honestly well done! You could have fapped and you chose not to.  




 Good post but there are many other types of people and reasons for joining nofap around here. I get that you're making a point but still... 




 Maybe you shoukd see a doctor. I don't want to sound mean or rude but I don't think nofap alone will help this. 




 Ha, ha I thought that was it but I've seen a lot of people complain about it while on hard mode 




 Yeah, the US tried to stay out of it. It was mainly a European conflict but of course the US and other countries got sucked in. 




 From what I know the flatline is when you have almost no libido. So should this not make this period easier? Unless I'm wrong and it's a period of high libido then I don't understand why so many people find it to be a period of difficulty. 




 I once fell in a pile of cow shit! Having a huge phobia of germs I ran home and showered for hours on end, got out bathed, showered again and then dried off. Even though I was fully clothed when it happened. Needless to say the clothes went in the bin. 




 Yeah it's like what happens if he gives him a hug or whatever. They're meh, derp. 




 I saw this a long time ago and laughed my ass off! 




 Walking. When I feel an urge, for the last few days I've got teady and taken the dogs for a walk. They enjoy it and it stops me from doing anything I'll regret. 




 That's to bad. Maybe you should try going back to warm and then in a week or two try cold again? 




 Awesome, count me in! 




 You too, stay strong. It's good that you stopped.  




 Hey man, good job. It's not easy to do that kinda thing. It'd be cool if you could post another picture (along side these two) in two months and show us your progress :) 




 Okaaay.  




 Did you "finish" if not I wouldn't reset, it's called edging but don't do it again. It's one of the worst things you can do since your basically teasing yourself. 




 Glad to hear it. Stay strong brother. 




 Ha, ha I'm literally just out of one. I think that's going to become my new norm. 




 Sure is, I heard it years ago but figured I'd post it anyway. 




 The Scotsman opens his lunch and says:

'Fur fuck sake if ma wife makes this pish again am gonnae jump aff this buildin'

As he looks at his ham sandwich.

Then the Englishman exclaims:

'Oh bloody hell if me wife makes this rubbish again I shall jump off of this building'

As he looks at his pickle sandwich.

Then the Irishman opens his lunch and says:

'If I get this again I'll jump off this building'

As he looks at his cheese sandwhich.

The next day they stop for lunch:

The Scotsman exclaims:

'Dumb bitch made this shite again, see yees later' and he jumps to his death.

Then the Englishman:

'Bloody hell, cheerio ol' chap' he waves to the iriishman and promptly jumps to his death.

Then Irishman:

'Ah well. It had to be cheese didn't it?'

And he jumps to his death. 

The three wives are friends and decide it's fitting to have a joined funeral.

As the Scotsmans wife and Englishmans wife mourn their husbands the Irishmans wife walks past them laughing in fits of hysteria.

This confuses them so they ask what's so funny to which she replies:

'My husband made his own sandwiches!!' 




 Ha, ha funny (I'm scottish) :D 




 Ha! Sick but ha! 




 Most people think it takes anywhere between 60 and 120 days, the most common being 90. 




 And you (yes you, I'm going to call you Mrs Pennyapple (I don't care if you're a guy you are now Mrs pennyapple)) are trying to fix that problem

I'm not going to try and say something inspirational, there are a bunch of posts there that we can all use but I am going to say well done. If you were to ask any guy to stop masturbating they'd probably laugh in your face (poor Mrs pennyapple) and if they did give it a shot they'd probably last a day and then give up and make a joke about how heavy their balls feel. But you, Mrs Pennyapple have realised and are trying to better yourself. So even if this sub is considered "weird" or "gay" or "culty" it doesn't matter because you are changing yourself for the better and they aren't. Well done Mrs Pennyapple.

Yes I posted this last night but I thought I'd add to it. Some of you aren't just struggling with PMO. You might be trying to quit weed, or videogames or maybe you want to lose weight. Yes this sub is called r/nofap but you, Mrs Pennyapple, have realised the issues affecting you and your family and friends and even if you fail at least you are making the effort to better yourself. So if you don't lose that extra belly fat, if you do play a videogame, if you do smoke a joint, if you do fap. At least you can say you tried. Yes you might fail but if you do pick yourself up and try again. Don't let it hold you back. Almost everyone here has relapsed at one point or another. Do you think those that have made it too 800 days just did that? No! They struggled and fought and made themselves do it and so can you. Keep going and you will get there, if it takes 90 days or 900 don't stop untill you reach your goal, whatever it may be. 




 Catholic here, hey. You're making the right choice. There are a few ways that can reassure you when you think of porn:

* Think of what a lot of those poor women have gone through. While many do it "for fun" a lot of pornstars were abused or are very poor. It's not nice to watch a woman struggling through life have sex on camera.

* it's essentially filmed prostitution. Would you have sex with a prostitute? Hopefully the answer is no, so why watch others?

* Sex should be private not something for the whole world to see. 

These make me think of why porn is so bad. If you do get a serious urge there are a couple of ways you can get rid of it:

* Meditate - This is VERY useful. Meditation can help you become calm and relaxed and get rid of stress (and urges). Here is a [wikihow article](http://m.wikihow.com/Meditate) that explains some basic meditating techniques. 

* Do something. Urges normally come when you have free time so take that time and use it constructively. Read a book, learn an instrument, exercise do anything to get your mind off of it. 

* All else failing install a porn blocker and randomise the password then when you get an urge put some ice cubes down your pants (this is only good at home not in public or at anyone else's house). The coldness really helps get it down. Finally if everything else has failed tell yourself you don't want to watch porn and then go for a cold shower. Seriously it helps.


Good luck.  




 I know but who cares?  




 Ha! 




 It's a website (obviously). You subscribe to subreddits which interest you (like r/gaming or r/baseball etc) there is a subreddit for virtually everything! 

Here you can talk to people with similar interests as you, trade things, ask questions (as you have done so eloquently yourself) and more!

 




 Wow! Congratulations!! That's fucking awesome! 




 You have to try them! I've heard people talk about them since I started nofap in January and last night I said fuck it. It was a pretty cold night so I wasn't sure it was a good idea but I went for it. Holy shit. It felt great, freezing, but great. Definitely try it if you haven't already. 




 No. A lot of people here have SO's. It's only an issue if you want to do "hard mode" (no porn, masturbating or sex). If you would like to do that you could tell your SO about nofap. But if you decide not to it's perfectly ok to have sex. 




 Craigslist is evil! 




 Oh my god 1.5tb of porn!? Well done for deleting it. Good luck on your journey. You did the right thing to delete all of that shit.  




 Ha, ha! I came here to try and tell you to stay strong or harden up etc but you got me! :D 




 When I get an urge I do one of two things:

1). Meditate. I use breathing meditations. It clears your mind of all thiughts (including urges) and is very effective. It's a very basic begginers guide but if you'd like to try it you can [read this wikihow article.](http://m.wikihow.com/Meditate) Like I said, it's basic but it can help you get started. Visualisation is also very useful. Lot's of people imagine that there problems are a balloon or a rock etc and they let them go or throw them away. It sounds very silly and childish but it does work.

2). If I can't meditate I change the subject in my head immediately! I don't care what too, straight away I think about school, tv, my doys! Anything that works!

Good luck, the fact that you've gone an entire day with it in your head and bot done anything about it is an achievement in itself. Just keep going.  




 Ha, ha 

 Her shit smells as bad as mine and no one's too good for me.

I like that. Thanks for the encouragement. 




 Ha, ha good luck Mrs Pennyapple! 




 I think it's because it's the social norm. It's often encouraged and people say it's healthy. Which I suppose in moderation (1-2 times a week, without porn) it could be. Peopl think because something's normal or acceptable it's ok or healthy but, like I said in the pist, I bet more guys have an addiction and don't even realise it. If they stopped I doubt they'd last. 




 Wow. Thanks!! :D 




 But you (yes you, I'm going to call you Mrs Pennyapple (I don't care if you're a guy you are now Mrs pennyapple)) have realised that you have an addiction. 

I'm not going to try and say something inspirational, there are a bunch of posts there that we can all use but I am going to say well done. If you were to ask any guy to stop masturbating they'd probably laugh in your face (poor Mrs pennyapple) and if they did give it a shot they'd probably last a day and then give up and make a joke. But you, Mrs Pennyapple have realised and are trying to better yourself. So even if this sub is considered "weird" or "gay" or "culty" it doesn't matter because you are changing yourself for the better and they aren't. Well done Mrs Pennyapple.  




 Thabks for answering. Enjoy work!  :) 




 I mean legend, anniversary and underworld. 




 Or oblivion or tomb raider  




 Almost everyone loves McDonald's but there is a definite stigma (in some areas) for people that work there. Do you feel there is a bad view for employees? 









 I like a "natural look". Skin coloured foundation and lipstick (I hate red lipstick on a girl). I also like dark eyeliner. 




 Ha, ha! 




 I know right. 




 Thank you. I did go outside and I'm going again soon. It's just walking my dogs instead of my brother doing it but it's a start. Ive played xbox today (playing it now) but I liked that article. Today I got up first thing, cleaned my room, ate breakfast and went a walk. As far as real life friends go, I had a great group but moved a while back. I have friends here but... meh. I don't know it's not the same. Plus when I did hang out with them after school one of them always wanted to talk about porn, gaming and masturbating so I think it's best I stay away from him.

I'm going to start writing again (I used to write fanfics). I don't think I can get rid of my xbox(s) but I'm going to play them less and less.  




 Hiya!! I'm Devlin, I'm 16. I love writing, tv, movies, books, gaming and music but I have a passion for history. I could talk about it forever (but I won't). I'm on kik:

DevlinFr3w99

Just send me a message here or there and we can talk :) 




 Bow and arrow. Replaying every game in the tomb raider series (yet again) and I'm on the reboot so I guess I'd use the signature weapon. 









 Hey, it's great that you're trying. I'd say the best thing you could do is 'cut out' these friends or tell them that you're trying to quit:

(1) Cutting them out:

This is extremely difficult and a hard choice to make but you should ask yourself a few questions:

A). Are they toxic?- - -Is there any possible way I can be around them and not smoke weed?

B). Are they really friends? - - - I don't know how far back you guys go back but ask yourself if they're really friends. One way to do this is to think if they've been there for you during hard times.

C). Would your life really change without them?

(2). Tell them you're trying to quit. If they're your friends they'll understand and won't get high when you're there, maybe they could quit with you?

I know better than anyone how hard it can be to make friends (past experiences) but it's possible. I don't know how old you are. If you're in high school try joining a club or finding people with similar interests as you. If you aren't in school or college try going online and meeting people in your area, this one can be a bit awkward but it's possible. 

Also pot isn't actually addictive, it has no addicive properties other than the fact that you enjoy it but it doesn't have addictive properties like heroine. 

Good luck and you're doing great quiting porn and going even further by quiting weed. Great job so far!! 














 Ha, ha someone else already asked but sure go ahead :) 









 Maybe it's not for you. That's fine, you can continue fapping but if you do I'm asking you not to watch porn. It sets unrealistic standards for what men expect, many of the women were/are sexually/physically/emotionally abused (I know lots aren't but you never know what people have gone through). It's someone's daughter, if you have one really think about what you would feel like if someone was fapping over her. Of course it's up to you but those are the negatives to porn. 




 Don't get me wrong I am not depressed. I love life but I've taken a look at it and I feel empty. I don't know if that's the right word. For context I'm in my teens, high school, and I feel like I've wasted this summer holiday. I've lain around the whole time on xbox and I've done nothing that'll make it memorable. I love gaming but I just find it so boring (I have for the last two days). I've never felt this way before. 

I keep saying I'm going to go outside a little more each day (since I spend a lot of time inside but I have asthma and it got pretty bad the other week to the point were I could barely breathe. I know I'm using that as an excuse since I feel much better now. I'm going to go outside tomorrow 100%

I can't really describe this but I feel angry since I know I failed my exams. I haven't had the results yet but I failed the mock exams which should've been a wake up call but... here I am. I can still pas  if I really focus next year. 

I realise this is just a rant but I don't know what to do. For the first time in years I'm really, really bored. Xbox normally keeps me happy and failing that a good book or movie but nothing's working! 

I have to thank nofap, however. I started this In January and have had some pretty good streaks but then I've quit and came back a few times. This is the first I've felt like this and even though I don't like it now I'm glad I do because I can see that I need to get my shit together. I've also meditated on and off but I'm back on that, thank you nofap. I intent to fix all of this crap. Tonight I'm turning off my xbox, going to sleep and waking up fresh and ready for whatever I decide to do first.  




 Ha, ha awesome. I wonder what he went on to do. 




 Ha, ha prove it! Marry me?! 




 Ha, ha female humans, do you enjoy this "subreddit" on the internet machine at the domain which your species calls "reddit?" 




 Yeah, I did. I really just said "gals". 




 So-so sometimes it's organised an  fun others not so much. Cyrodiil is also a great place to quest but also dangerous. You don't need a group but I recommend one. 









 When in pvp stay with other players. If you go off on your own you will likely fie. Th  larger the group the better. Try and fight others around your level, that's not to day don't figbt back against a higher level but don't actively seek them out. 

Use all of your offence and defence abilities. A good idea is to have your main hand for offence and your second hand (unlocked at level 15) for defence. 

Practice makes perfect. Th  more you play the better you'll get. 




 I'm the youngest of 6 children so my mum was in her early 40's at the time and my dad his late 40's. I honestly don't remember most of the dream that vividly but I remember the fear the room gave me and when my mum told me she had it too. I mainly remember the cloak and choking. 




 Yeah, I'm flattered. I never really thought much of it. Use a head. 









 This is my exact post from r/paranormal can anyone tell me ***anything*** about what this could mean?

When I was a kid my family and I moved to the countryside. For the first four years we lived in a small town which was fine but we eventually moved, quite litterally to the middle of nowhere. It was this one street town with like 4 houses. It was ok because I spent most of my time indoors anyway (I've always been indoors-ey).
The house we were living in was big, much bigger than anything I had ever stayed in before (before we moved to the countryside we lived in a suburban area of a city with a pretty big home, then a small town, then the middle of nowhere). Most of the bedrooms were upstairs but there was one down stairs. Everytime you went in it it was cold, when I say cold I mean it felt like ice, you could always see your breath. So, as a rule, I stayed out of there. The rest of the house was awesome and my brothers and sisters and I had a pretty cool time living there but I started getting horrible feelings whenever I went near the cold room:
My eyes would water like I was going to cry, I would get a sore chest. I always tried to keep myself calm by explaining to myself that it was just me, I got a sore chest because of my asthma, I had watery eyes because of some other reason I'm sure I found less than convincing.
The part that gets creepy was when our kitchen was being remodeled. Because of the layout of the kitchen we had to move the fridge into the cold bedroom untill the remodelling was finished. I couldn't stand going in there and eventually I straight out refused. You see I spend a lot of time with my two dogs (who were younger at the time) since I'm almost always inside and whenever they went near that room they would show their teeth and raise their hackles, which they virtually never do.
One night I fell asleep and had this nightmare. In it I went into the room to get something as fast as I possibly could but then the door slammed shut and I couldn't open it for the life of me. On the other side my brother was trying to force it open. Then this man appeared he was clothed in a huge black cloak and started mumbling words I couldn't make out before he started choking me. I woke up coughing like mad and had, what I call, a "mini" asthma attack. I told my mum the next morning and she starred as if looking through me not at me. Then she said:
'XboxG4mer I had the exact same dream'
She never wanted to freak me out so straight away she comforted me by telling me it was just a dream. I kept having the same nightmare and I never asked her but I think my mum did too because after a couple of months we moved away.
The man in the dream was old but looked wholly evil. I don't know what happened in that house but there was something about that room. Nothing could warm it and the eery sensations I got when near it were stronger than any I've ever felt.
EDIT 1: So a few of you said I should look into it and see what I can find. When I did a quick google of the street it turned up nothing and gave me the names of nearby locations. I'll update again soon.
EDIT 2 So I found it on the googs (sounds weird, google sounds better). However it only spoke about how the "village" once had a larger population, a school and a train station etc but after the coal mining industry in the area was done many people moved and full streets lay empty. I knew all of this and when I say full streets I mean like 15 houses maybe 20, barely anyone lives there today. 




 Wow. In my dream I lost my breath in the room aswell and he, I call him he but most of his face was covered by the cloak, just began relentlessly choking me. I wonder if they were to do with the house?  




 Could you link me to the app? 




 Awesome. Enjoy it and stay safe out there. 




 Ha, ha good one :) 




 Can I ask: how did you do that? Drawing? Computers? Either way thank you so much!! 




 Oh my god that is so fucking awesome, thank you!! :D 




 I've started looking into it, I'll keep you all posted :) 




 Ha, ha I doubt it'd be very interesting just an old house with a cold room and some creaky floors :) I'll see what I can find out about it though.
 




 No. Not since I moved. She never had it blessed and while she doesn't talk about it a lot I know my mum's had some paranormal experiences. I checked and the house was built during world war 2.
 




 I could check. I know some people that live near there. I never really thought about it. I've wondered if I maybe caused it. At the time I was maybe eleven? Twelve? One of them and I ha  been reading (quite a bit about astral projection). I decided (because of religious reasons) not to go through with it but I tried one day. Maybe it's related, maybe not?
