 I am trying to submit Youtube videos of some of my favorite songs that I think others might enjoy. When I click "submit" it throws up an exception in red text  under the that says "that reddit only allows text posts" I don't understand. The sub is filled with Youtube videos, and I thought music videos were the preferred posts there.  


































 She left her ID near the MoneyGram Kiosk, and found it lying there later.

 Ed and Bob had just landed the biggest sale in their firm's history. Ed knew he had to hurry home to his pushy wife Mary, but Bob persuaded him to have a drink or two at a nearby tavern. Being a lightweight, Ed vomited all over his shirt and tie after only a few. 

"Aww man, Mary is going to kill me Bob. You know she doesn't want me drinking or hanging out in bars." 

Bob, feeling overly confident about their recent victory was sure he had the solution. "Don't you worry about her.  Just put this crisp twenty in your shirt pocket. When she sees the vomit tell her that someone else puked on you, and gave you the twenty to pay for the cleaning." They continued to drink until the Tavern closed and each took their own cab home. 

When Ed arrived, Mary was waiting, furious at the hour, and his obvious state of drunkenness. 

"Where have you been!" Ed was already unbuttoning his shirt. "You're drunk... and covered in vomit! What is wrong with you? I should have listened to my mother you worthless sack of... "

"Now hold on one minute, woman!" Ed drunkenly interrupted while Mary tore through and examined his things. "I can explain that vomit! It wasn't me! A guy down at the Tavern threw up all over my shirt. Look in my shirt pocket, there's a  twenty dollar bill. He was honorable enough to pay for the cleaning." He was already crawling into bed, and pulling the covers over himself. "You see, I'm not always the bad guy." 

Mary held up two twenty dollar bills. " Ed, there was $40 in your pocket." 

Ed lifted up from his pillow, squinted one eye, and tried to focus on her. "Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you. He shit my pants too." 


Apologies for submitting from a mobile device. 




 The CS2X caught my attention on eBay. I read some reviews and it sounds like an underrated instrument that can be extremely useful. Anyone play and/or have one? 




 I understand this wasn't a very popular virtual/sampler synthesizer. I can understand some of the gripes I've come across on forums. Support being discontinued being the biggest. But, I am impressed by some of the sounds this thing can produce. I like that it can be programmed and then disconnected from the computer. I was wondering if anyone had any advice with programming the thing. I've spent a few hours with it, and I'm amazed by the number of parameters and controls the thing has. The multi function seems really powerful. Does anyone have any experience with uploading patterns? I've noodled around with many of the presets, but still haven't found a clear path toward making my own patches from scratch. Is that possible? Any other general advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance. 




 I would like the sequencer on the Microbrute to sync up with the Venom. I have both MIDI cables amd USB. I would prefer to be able to sync them without using a DAW as I would like to jam free of the computer. I understand how to use MIDI to control one device with another, but I'm not getting anywhere with sending a clock signal between two. Can anyone help me with this? 









 I have a Arturia Laboratory, a Microbrute, and a Boss Dr-550mkII. Two interfaces , Berhinger Q502USB and a an old Tascam US-122L. Tascam has an in/out so I've been playing with it. I have plenty of cables. I am trying to sync these devices without using the USB connection on the Microbrute. If I use more than one USB connection for audio, the noise becomes unbearable. I want to use these devices separately without one ever controlling the other. Just sync. The Laboratory has a Midi in/out. The Microbrute and Boss have an input only. Is there any way that I can make this happen? 




 I am going to keep this as short as possible. Whenever I have my computer plugged into my mixer via USB, I get a loud, high pitched buzz.  It went away the other night, and came back tonight.  I tried isolating every appliance and florescent bulb in the house with no effect. I'm wondering if a failing HDD could cause this? Maybe the power supply fan? I really enjoyed combining my analog gear with my soft synth. Now the frequencies of both are affected. This noise is driving me nuts!

edit: first I tried lifting the ground on the PC, but that only helped when I used my best cable. (I have several music USB cables) I realize that the cables were in the inductive field of my stereo.  Moved the stereo box and everything went away. Sweet silence. I then reapplied the ground to protect my machines and house. Sorry if I wasted anyone's time. I feel like this has been a useful thread. I learned more than a couple of things. Thanks to everyone who commented. Y'all helped me get into critical thinking mode. I don't get enough of it. Thanks again.  
























 Let me first say I'm open to any input as long as it is budget oriented.

I recently acquired an Arturia MicroBrute, and I naturally would like to expand the capabilities of the instrument with some simple effects (and later some complicated stereo effects). I was looking at Zoom effects first because of the value of their entry level line (and the seemingly ancient Reznor endorsement). 

My question mostly involves the frequency processing of bass and guitar effects. I know there is a distinct difference between these instruments. How confined are these pedals to these frequency profiles? I am a bassist by nature (bass guitarist), but I intend on using the full range of the MicroBrute through looping and sampling. I just don't have much money.

I can shoot some sexy pics of the MicroBrute and my Laboratory 49 if necessary.

 Is it not common knowledge that more than 90% of the veteran's walking around are not active duty or retired and therefore do not currently hold a military ID of any kind? I'm posting this because my university sent out an email inviting everyone to a special football game. The email explained that veteran's and active military get in free with an active ID. Only people who are active, retired, or disabled get an ID. In fact not all disabled have an ID. All of these offers just end up being a slap in the face.

 Did I say they weren't a threat? No, I didn't.

I was simply pointing out the ridiculousness of your assertion that they "almost won". 

Please tell us more about how they were winning before the allies decimated their entire empire. Tell us about how these competent leaders dragged their country and citizens into an unwinnable unsustainable military campaign that ultimately resulted in the fracturing of their country and the nearly total destruction of its infrastructure. 

Tell us how it was an entirely competent decision to wage an invasion against the Soviets. Explain how in their great wisdom and cunning strategic logic they came to form an alliance with a belligerent and ideologically diseased state like prewar Japan, and how that state waged an antagonistic bombing campaign against the United States effectively bringing them into the war. Tell us about these "great leaders".  




 Yes! Thank you. Allying with Japan was also a huge mistake.  




 It's getting really heated in there. I was just asked if I'm stupid because 

Incompetent leaders wouldn't have almost won against all the superpowers of the world. The Nazis were fucking evil, and I am glad they lost. They were competent as hell though.

That's hilarious. 

 




 Are you stupid? 

Incompetent leaders wouldn't have almost won against all the superpowers of the world. The Nazis were fucking evil, and I am glad they lost. They were competent as hell though.

Bwahaha! 

Edit: Sorry, I just got carried away by the ridiculousness of your comment. Please tell us more about how "They almost won against all of the superpowers of the world". 
 




 The Third Reich manifested during peace time. It's not stupid to look at these things with an* honest and transparent attitude. 

 




 No I'm not. And they're often interrelated.  




 They should change the instructions in the sidebar.  




 You are an apologist if you honestly believe that the Third Reich was comprised of competent leadership. Waging a two front war against all of the world's superpowers? Forming an alliance with belligerent bloodthirsty Japan? The fucking Holocaust? All of the backward hateful rhetoric that was used by the Reich from its inception? There are countless cases of incompetence within the party and throughout the war.  









 I suppose you think that "drug dealers" aren't people and therefore shouldn't have any rights?  




 Many would argue that Germany's actions leading up to and during the war were little more than drunken belligerence. During the final days the Reich and the Wermacht destroyed as much infrastructure as they could in order to prevent the allies from using it. It's disingenuous Nazi apologia to suggest that somehow Germany was less responsible for it's postwar state than Greece is for it's current problems.  




 I disagree. You cited one example of a Jamaican citizen and two other black gentlemen who were commissioned officers (a lieutenant is not a senior officer) but were then dismissed to join the Union Army early in the war. The 1,500 or 2,000 black soldiers and three black officers would have been prohibited from serving in the confederacy in 1862 and your source says that 10% of them went and joined the Union Army. 

You don't have an argument. You either don't understand military rank structure or you're willing to ignore glaring contradictions in your narrative in order to maintain it. Three low ranking officers who served very shortly before being disbanded would not have qualified in any manner as "senior military officers". By the end of the war these men would have been American war heroes, not defeated Confederates. But I encourage you to continue your efforts. Maybe while reading about these men and others like them you'll learn a thing or two about how evil the Confederate leadership really was.  




 Don't you mean that Germany was limping for getting into a drunken brawl that they in fact started? Then, once they realized they were sure to lose they began burning their cloths and effects so that no one else could have access to them?  




 When the Louisiana State Legislature banned people of color from serving in the Confederate Army in February 1862, the regiment was disbanded. Morris and about 10% of the other former 1st Louisiana Native Guard joined the Union Army in September 1862 and were organized into a new unit that was assigned the same name. There Morris became the first black Jewish officer in the Union Army. 

Hmm. Got any other great examples?  




 "nor the greedy". So when will Christians start their campaign to disenfranchise and marginalize the rich?

 Yeah, this is a thing. AA is not a [therapeutic] (http://www.propublica.org/article/how-alcoholics-anonymous-can-be-a-playground-for-violence) environment for alot of people. Beyond being predatory the twelve step system is also not an [effective drug or alcohol treatment program, ] (http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/does-alcoholics-anonymous-work/)  it is a fundamental violation of our first amendment rights as many people are pushed into twelve step whether they're religious or not. Jesus is the most common* topic of discussion for many twelve step groups. This is an everyday violation of our constitutionally protected religious rights, but you don't hear anyone stopping or backing up governmental process over it.

Edit: I'm a huge supporter of gay rights, but I feel that all human rights depend on secularism.  




 I chose* this one because (as you can see) this officer proclaims to be a part of a "we"  that has a contract to "clean up the site". If anyone has anything to say about this select group of users "cleaning up the site" this would be the place and time.  




 Started a new sub. 




 Ideally, this would be a place to discuss the police and the bullshit they spew on pns. I would be open to allowing apologia from other corners of reddit as long as we follow the .np and archive rule. No direct links ever! We can't have a simple conversation with people staring over our shoulders and I won't tolerate them. This is designed to be a circle jerk and that it will be.  









 Like I said. Strict rules. No direct linking, no brigading. If you're interested in moderating, get in touch. Otherwise, have fun. 




 Edit: Thanks for your support. Sub is up and running. If there's a way, could you please give me access to those archives you removed. My sub is only for archives and .Np contributions. I've contacted /u/insaneterrorist. I hope that he digs what I'm trying to get going. Thanks again. 


Please direct those users to contribute to /r/shitpnssays. I'll do my best to keep this conversation alive. 




 It's new. The .np and archive rule is nonnegotiable I will ban you. Otherwise, Come one, come all. If you'd like to moderate please get in touch. /r/shitpnssays 




 I don't disagree with you, but hear me out. /r/shitredditsays is a self-professed, unapologetic circlejerk. They ban anyone who tries to stop the jerk and even those who don't want to jerk. They're protected by the rules of reddit because they ban folks who attack the topic of conversation. They describe their sub as a "turd museum". "Don't touch the turds.". That's  cool that you want to change this sub. I'm still planning on starting my sub. I hope that you'll promote on mine as I'd like to promote on yours.  




 I agree. I don't consider myself an expert in theology, but I'd say that greed has been a tool of the leaders of western Christianity for forty or fifty years at least. When we talk about the US, I'm pretty sure we can walk back all the way to the very beginning and see greed as the singular motivation in most things.  




 I just checked it out. Are you referring to all of the memes? Maybe I'll start a ~~/r/shitprotectandservesays~~ /r/shitpnssays later.  




 Yeah that's him. His videos are very informative.  




 Thank you for being so candid. It's not common for believers to speak honestly about these offenses which may not affect literally every church but are extremely common.  




 Is he the body guard guy who always has his lawyer waiting by the phone? His videos are awesome. He really knows what he's doing and doesn't fuck around. Those are how first amendment audits ought* to be conducted.  




 Shouldn't you have included some text or even a source?  




 Yeah I would be more supportive of banning brigadiers and removing the downvote button than censoring content to protect the feelings of a few butthurt piggy-wiggies.  




 What about conversations where officers are flippant about the law, joke about harming people, or blatantly ignore or ridicule constitutional rights?  




 Apparently she's been very clear that has every intention of keeping the position.  




 I guess "cleaning up the site" means* cops brigading any comment that isn't explicitly procop or any they disagree with.  




 Yes it does.  




 She did actually. She did an interview with the New York Times.  




 You're mistaken if you took anything I've said as a defense of American law enforcement.  




 I don't think it's ever going to go away.  




 Kickbacks for RXs is illegal. 

Yet it happens all of the time. Go [here] (https://openpaymentsdata.cms.gov/) and look up your doctor or some local doctors. My previous psychiatrist who works in a state funded mental health clinic has personally received around $25,000 from pharmaceutical companies. 

You can hurl whatever personal insults at me that you like. I was simply pointing out this very cosy relationship between pharmaceutical companies and physicians. That's fine if you disagree. But don't suggest that I'm crazy or that this issue isn't worth talking about.  




 I wasn't agreeing with all of the statement, but I think people saw that I was agreeing that these men in the picture were fighting for their country, and I pointed out that not all German soldiers were Nazis, can you not see the difference in the two comments?

But yes, you just can't predict reddit logic sometimes!

 









 Thanks for the link. Lots of useful stuff.  




 They are most commonly prescribed to people with mild to moderate depression. SSRIs are not effective for mild to moderate depression. What is so complicated about this?  




 Racial profiling isn't unique to American police.  




 The magnitude of benefit of antidepressant medication compared with placebo increases with severity of depression symptoms and may be minimal or nonexistent, on average, in patients with mild or moderate symptoms. 

For the vast majority of patients ssris produce the same effect as a placebo.  




 Considering that they're most commonly prescribed for cases of mild/moderate depression, I would argue that it does.  




 Where the hell does it say that this sub is only for the misconduct of American police?  




 Does the [JAMA count?] (http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=185157)  




 Yes they actually can. They can receive all kinds of kickbacks and favors from drug companies and simply prescribing medications to all of their patients streamlines and maximizes the profitability their practices. A medicated patient is placated and must return to the office periodically to renew their prescriptions. A renewal is a fast and easy billable visit. 

Edit: forgot two words.  




 Does that really matter though?  




 I didn't say that people didn't matter. I'm just saying that a business closing is nothing like a person dying. It's not even close. If the business closes the people who worked there are free to find employment elsewhere. A dead person cannot. 

Businesses close all of the time. Most close because of causes that are completely out of the control of the organization's leaders. If a bakery refused to follow sanitation codes the health department would shut them down and it would be their fault. It wouldn't matter if they had a religious belief that washing their hands is wrong. If a business is operating on such unsustainable policies as refusing to provide the products and services that they deal in, why should it be a surprise when they have to shut their doors?  




 A business closing down is hardly the same as a person dying. Businesses close and are restructured all of the time. Most don't close as a result of a policy so stupid as refusing to provide the good or service they deal in. The individual(s)  with the* capital can choose to take* their money and knowledge and engage in other business efforts. A dead person can do none of* these things. The argument that businesses are people is as ridiculous as one can be. Businesses are comprised of people and those individuals already have the protections and rights of a human being. Businesses don't warrant some special status as human beings. 

The cake situation, as ridiculous as it might be, is exactly what we're talking about here. That's the real world example.  




 How is that even close to comparable? It's not like it's an atrocity that a baker should have to bake a cake.  
















































































































































 A lot of people (myself included) are fed up with the way that sub is moderated. I'm looking for alternatives that don't arbitrarily prohibit subject material like police brutality/harassment. Thanks in advance for any input.

 Two New Yorkers are driving across the country. When they cross the Texas border the passenger looks at the driver and explains "Texas cops are supposed to be the worst and they really don't like New Yorkers. Let's try to obey all of the traffic laws so we can get through this state without any problems."

They hadn't made it very far when the driver notices a state trooper's cruiser appear behind them with lights ablazed. He quickly puts on his signal and pulls over. The trooper approaches the driver side window and the driver quickly lowers his window, only to find the officers baton smashing into his face. 

"What the fuck was that for!?" the driver exclaims. 

"I don't know how you city slickers do things in New York, but in my state you'll have your license and registration waiting for me when I approach your vehicle." the trooper barks at the driver. Frantically the driver retrieves the paperwork and hands it to the cop, who proceeds to write him a ticket. "Wait right there. " he spits while handing the ticket over to the driver.  He walks around the car and taps on the passenger side window with his baton. Nervously the man lowers his window. The officer quickly strikes him in the face.


"What the hell did I do!? He shouts as blood runs down his chin.

 Reserve deputy Rick Walter was catching up on paperwork one night in the fall of 1992 when he was told to check out an abandoned car near Interstate 55.

He found a 1986 Buick Somerset at the top of an exit ramp about 1:30 a.m., just outside of this southeastern Missouri town that rises above the Mississippi River floodplain. Inside was the body of Angela Mischelle Lawless, a 19-year-old nursing student.

Lawless had been shot three times, once in the back of the head. But when Walter looked inside the car, he couldn't determine exactly how she had died.

"It was dark, and I didn't know if it was somebody just passed out," Walter said. "We opened the door and saw all the blood."

Fifteen years later, Walter, now the Scott County sheriff, sits in his windowless office and lets the Lawless case play out in his mind. There should be little reason to think about it now. Joshua Charles Kezer was convicted for the killing and sentenced to 60 years in prison. The case is closed.

But things just don't add up, Walter said.

Lawless clearly fought for her life against at least two attackers, Walter said, and yet, investigators identified and pursued only one suspect.

There were no witnesses to the killing. No physical evidence - DNA, fingerprints or murder weapon - linked Kezer to the scene. In fact, Kezer's friends and family say he wasn't even in the state the night Lawless was killed.

"People in the law enforcement community and regular people here have told me that they got the wrong guy in jail," Walter said.

So in early 2006, Walter did something almost unheard of in law enforcement: He reopened a murder case that was not only closed, but had already produced a conviction.

The sheriff and one of his detectives began reviewing hundreds of pages of investigative reports and witness statements. It would be a daunting task.

Witnesses were scattered. Fingerprints and blood can be reviewed and retested, but it was unclear what could be gleaned more than a decade later.

None of that mattered to the sheriff, a former construction worker who regularly wears a quarter-size pin that reads "My Son is a Marine." He already knew that if he ever got the chance, he would reopen the case.

"I wake up most mornings and wonder, 'Why am I sheriff?'" said Walter, who was elected in 2004. "I think this is why - to find the truth on this case."

FIRST TO THE SCENE

Everyone called her Mischelle. She was a cheerleader for the Kelly High School Hawks basketball team in Benton, and a farm girl at heart, having been active in the local FFA Organization.

In her younger years, she was a Girl Scout who volunteered as a candy-striper at area hospitals, so it was only natural that Lawless would pursue a nursing degree at Southeast Missouri State University.

"That's what she always wanted to do," her brother Jason said.

In many ways, Lawless was a bundle of contradictions. By her sophomore year in college, she was juggling boyfriends and partying a lot, friends said, yet she remained a regular at the Baptist Student Union.

Though she weighed just 95 pounds, Lawless wasn't afraid to stand up for herself. 



I know this may be pretty well known, but it happened very nearby and has been complicated and painful for this area.

 I don't disagree. But, I think that statistics on poverty, education, and other socioeconomic factors should be the focus of such conversations. It's not like a person's race makes them any more or less likely to commit a crime. 

Edit: inserted a space.  




 I did read it. I was aware of the fact. I don't see how it's relevant. It doesn't necessarily mean he's not a citizen. At the very least he would be a permanent resident. Aside from the threat of deportation, there shouldn't be different laws for immigrants.  




 You make some fine points all of which I'm sure are being debated by the relevant authorities in Sweden and elsewhere. 

I'm not sure about prison being an effective deterrent to violent crime. At first glance, it seems obvious that it would be, but when you look at the socioeconomic and psychological causes of a lot of violent behavior, it becomes much more complicated. It's also worth mentioning that prisons in the US are known for victimizing inmates and conditioning them to be irrational and violent when they are eventually released. 

I'm getting a lot of downvotes here, and I guess I understand. If someone had done something like this to my child, prison for the offender wouldn't be the issue. But my argument is basically that we in US have been locking up anyone and everyone for several decades now. While overall crime has decreased, it's not necessarily a result of our increasingly militarized police or our eagerness to imprison even nonviolent offenders, and violent crime hasn't disappeared. 

There are people all over the world who would argue that what we're doing here is wrong, but we're not going to listen to them. It's up to us to come to our own conclusions. We are one of the least likely to allow any other body in the world to violate our sovereignty, yet we do it to others quite often. If a country like Sweden wants to operate a criminal justice system that focuses on aiding victims, rehabilitation, and preventing recidivism, they have every right to do so and we should let them.  




 Comments that have been deleted by the mods still show up in the count too.  




 I don't disagree that a rapist should spend at least some time in prison, but it's not my decision to make. 


My point is that you and I have no business making demands of the judges, juries, and lawyers of the judicial systems of sovereign foreign countries. The people of Sweden have faith in their elected and appointed officials.  Their system is focused on aiding the victims of crimes, rehabilitating offenders, and preventing recidivism. No amount of prison time served is going to unrape that girl.  




 I'm not saying it isn't. I'm just saying that Americans are so prison happy that they have the audacity to tell lawyers, judges, and juries how to do their jobs in foreign countries.  




 This was almost funny as a red bull commercial five or seven years ago.  




 Meanwhile in the US, we have more people in prison than any other country in human history. We're so eager to throw people in prison that we want to force other countries to imprison their own citizens.

 I think you're confused. You should look at the comment I mentioned. /u/Humboldtblue put contigo777 in his place.  




 I don't see how the title was editorialized.  




 Yeah. They just rounded up and killed millions of civilians, guys. They were no different than any other army. /s 




 Scientology is dying off because more and more people are being exposed to their lies and crimes.  




 What is your malfunction?  




 There's no rational argument that a maple leaf is imitation marijuana. Japanese maples are incredibly common. I can think of some right outside local schools in my town. A police officer who's not a drooling idiot should know the difference between a common tree and an illicit substance.  




 There's a lot to be said about your point. When outside aid comes into a disaster area they're essentially outsourcing local labor and/or materials. Local workers and businesses need to operate in order for the area to properly recover. It's also a bit of a waste to move volunteers and resources so far when there's work to be done in their immediate communities. It's always good to help, but sometimes these projects end up backfiring in unforeseen ways. I've also heard arguments that these sorts of mission trips are chosen for selfish reasons such as getting to travel to exotic or distant locations or even the opportunity to evangelize to strangers.  




 It is. It wasn't a reasonable mistake by any stretch of the imagination.  




 Way to continue to spread misinformation without providing any sources of your own. Did you go on to read about the control group under the influence of alcohol and drugs? The increased risk is almost identical. 

The fact that you're ignoring the data and continuing to demonize the mentally ill is fucking offensive. Instead of relying on your gut feelings and biases, read the data.  




 I was struck by a DUI driver who was going very fast while driving down the road and the cop messed up the report and said that I was sitting stationary at the stop sign. I was literally two blocks from the stop sign. The other driver blew a .343 and totalled my car.  




 Luckily, the many Christian denominations were fearful and disapproving of one another to the point that they allowed secularism to grow.  




 He paid for the DUI hit and run offender?  




 I'm just trying to show another extreme point to help get you guys out. 

These sound like the words of a man who knows he's been defeated. 

You understand that your point of view is the default right? Besides PnS there are literally thousands of media outlets that agree with you entirely. There's no need for your "counter point". 

 




 You cleared all doubt about this with every other comment you've made in this thread.  




 It wouldn't if you were in the district he was taking from and ran out of water.  




 Der. Open our minds? Could you be any more condescending?  




 No, my apologies for not understanding.  




 Like I said, there is no shortage of assholes who think that the government has no business in R    D. I'm sorry if you thought I was one of them.  




 Good on ya. Elevators and trains are rare in much or the States. Mostly there's not a problem, but there are places where it's difficult to discern whether people's actions are a result of their ignorance or their pride. I think that every elevator should have a sign that explains the simple rules of etiquette. Then it can just be a matter of digging your heels into the ground. 

Edit: feeling superior to others is unfortunately still very much a part of the American way. 

Edit 2: I'm sure that as well behaved as they were, I remember these types of etiquette reminders all over Japan. I lived there for two and a half years.  




 I agree, but they aren't going to just disappear. We need to adopt a general policy of at least scowling at them.  




 No problem. I wasn't trying to insult you. I was only being honest.

How about you do your own damn research before you start spouting out garbage on the intertubes. Really.  




 Do you want people to read the words you type or are you doing it for your own sake? 

I'm not saying anything that a 10th grade English teacher wouldn't say to you. I'm on mobile nearly all of the time. Figure out how to get your point across in a readable format or don't bother. That's up to you.  




 I would start here at the [original post. ] (https://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/comments/3ck4x6/photographer_imagines_life_filled_with_anxiety/)  




 Yeah, but the average congressperson's life long pension is only $174,000 how do you expect them to raise a family on that? 

Oh wait, the average median household income in the US is $51,000.

How about prohibiting them from earning a private income while drawing from this pension that they both enjoy so much and cannot seem to live on?  




 I dunno. Many of the people I know work more than ten hours a day. Essentially saying that they're lazy isn't a good way to win votes.  




 Hit enter twice to form a paragraph break. Especially when you feel that you've included more than three strongly interrelated topics or just more than one topic. I'm almost always on mobile so I don't get that excuse. 

You want people to read the words you write, yeah?  




 And don't walk down it two-abreast. If a pathway only accommodates two people, you're effectively fucking everyone coming the opposite direction. Have a little self awareness and some common decency.  




 Better yet, don't lend out money you expect to see again. If someone desperately needs money, give it to them or don't. Otherwise don't get involved.  




 Some people think it's okay to treat their own things like shit. So the moral of the story is, "Don't lend out your things if you care about them.  




 Yeah unfortunately, there are people who are so oblivious that they'll still look at you like you're the asshole.  




 True. But no one has ever suggested that we ban privately funded research. There are those who believe that the government has no place in R   D.  




 I don't disagree, but it rightfully pisses people off when they watch wealthy and famous people steal from public resources. Also I'm more for using technology to make these thiefs donate to public funds. No sense in wasting money on some private contractor to sit in his car intermittently for two years which is what appears to have happened here. Some decent cameras and SSDs will do the trick and not just for one* but for everyone.  




 Two or three times a week?  




 TheCalleguas Municipal Water Districtsaid in its complaint filed Monday in Ventura County Superior Court that on more than a dozen occasions since 2013, a whitetruck filled up at a Thousand Oaks hydrant and hauledthe waterto Sellecks 60-acre ranchin Westlake Village.

"More than a dozen" And those were just the times their overpriced PI was around to catch him. 

I'm not going to say that this wasn't a waste of money, but I'll argue that it wasn't a complete waste. Obviously some well placed, relatively inexpensive cameras could have  been as effective as this guy. But someone stealing that amount of public water is unacceptable. Fuck them for the way they did it though. They should have spent $5,000 to receive $15,000 or $20,000 in fines and penalties and then been able to use the surveillance equipment to catch other offenders. 

Edit: grammar and formatting with millions of mosquitoes tormenting me.  




 Where did you get twelve instances? He was sent a cease and desist at least two years ago.   




 That sounds like an effective argument for publicly funded research right there.  




 Honest question, where did you get $600? 









 Paragraphs! Get some!  




 No I did not imply anything. I asked a simple question. If you have to breathe* more into it than there actually is, then that's your problem.  




 ~~They~~ Two of them are being charged with second degree murder.  




 My state is Missouri and therefore only marginally better than *El Salvador. Members of my family who I have never worked for own businesses and employ lawyers. I'm sorry if it offends you that I would take their opinions over that of random internet guy's.  




 I'm pretty sure that what you're saying doesn't apply in my state. I've never heard of anyone suing over wrongful termination here. Every employer I've spoken with about this issue has told me they were very confident in their right to fire anyone at any time. Hell, I had a boss that was two months behind on my pay. Me and four other employees couldn't even get the state to call us back.  




 Yeah cause unions are growing organizations and a growing movement in this country. /s

And yeah it is true. My state is an "at will" state. A private employee can be fired at any time for no reason. In fact, employers who do not state a reason are better off than the ones who do because there's nothing to contest.  




 Poor women do not have access to any healthcare under medicaid. At least not until they get pregnant in my state. 

My insurance covers my routine checkups. It also covers me if something terrible happens that puts me in the hospital and unable to pay. 

Contraception is a preventative treatment. What about this aren't you understanding? Why should married people be required to wear condoms? 


"Wah! I don't want to contribute to something I'll ostensibly never benefit from even if I have benefited from it in the past, and my children will most likely benefit from it in the future. Screw everyone, I got mine!"

Literally millions of people are unable to afford preventative care and end up much sicker than they would have been otherwise. The costs are in the hundreds of billions of dollars. Tens of thousands will die in the states that refused to expand Medicaid solely to defy the president. 

Anyone who thinks that health insurance is complete rip off has never been sick and therefore working on the faulty logic of "it hasn't happened yet, and therefore won't ever happen", or is probably wealthy enough to not be worried about in the first place.  




 They lost the election by a split vote. Purely northern states wanted to impose their will on southern states.

Yeah nothing says tyranny like representative democracy. 


They fired first because they were idiots. 

Belligerent idiots. But yeah, no argument here. 


The seceded because they objected to having no say and no rights in their own territory.

This is where OP dives off the deep end. The Confederate states tried multiple times to force their will on the federal government as well as northern states themselves with the fugitive slave acts. Then they tried to force their will upon the people of Kansas when they contested its formation as a free state. 


By expand you mean establish more states with westward expansion? The North imposed their will on the south which completely violated the basic compact of the union in the first place. 

And how was that? By allowing Kansas to decide for themselves whether they wanted to allow slavery or not? Or by voting in the elections? 


And of course they would want them returned, they were property to them. This would be like crossing a state line and getting your car impounded then sold off because someone else didn't like that you owned it and you got nothing for it. 

Yeah it would be exactly like that if your car was a person you had enslaved and brought into a free territory. 



Slavery is still wrong, and it was a major issue, but it's not the whole sum of all issues. Both sides were dicks to each other. 


The protection of the institution of slavery was the sole reason for the South's secession. I'd have to say that the south were the bigger dicks being that they committed treason, attacked the US, considered owning people as property as the greatest material interest of mankind, and literally everything that the surviving confederates did in the decades after the war. 

Edit: I'm sorry, I thought this sub was about pointing out the factual errors of confederate and southern apologists. If I was mistaken, I'll gladly move on. .  




 Lol. You know as well as I do why that would be* wholly inappropriate. Thanks for the offer though.  




 There *are zero out of pocket costs for contraception because it saves money in the long term. This isn't that complicated. Unwanted pregnancies are expensive for insurance companies and costly for our society. 

The reason people purchase insurance is to be prepared for the unknown. As far as healthcare goes, it's not a matter of if we'll get sick, but when. We've been denying people preventative care and forcing them into emergency departments long enough to know that experiment has been a failure. This is why we pay more than any other industrialized nation but aren't anywhere near the top in terms of care. You're calling me economically illiterate while simultaneously suggesting we continue to dig the same hole we've been digging for decades.  




 I vote for candidates that support the people. In my area there aren't many unions left so there's really nothing left to defend. We do however have violent occupying paramilitary forces that exist solely to protect the interests of the ruling class. I'll choose my own battles, thank you.  




 An "unconfirmed rumor" or a "complete fabrication" on the part of the Baltimore Police Department?  




 Gee, it would be nice if us private employees enjoyed the same luxuries as you jack booted thugs.  




 Yeah, in the private sector there really isn't a such thing as "fired prematurely" and certainly not in the case of committing criminal acts of violence. Private employees can be fired for no reason at all, at any time.  




 Are you suggesting that the benefits that people get from their private health insurance are free? 

Condoms are a form of contraception. The birth control pill can be used at the same time as condoms. 

Your family is sacrificing because you have to provide them health insurance? Well fuck that. I mean, I'm sure there aren't any females in your family right? And even if there were, they shouldn't have access to medical treatments for their lady parts right? That's just not Christian. /s

Your ideas are bad and you should feel bad. Private insurance requires members to pay premiums and deductibles out of their own pockets. You're still just whining because other people don't have to listen to your obtuse point of view and might benefit from a system that is too cooperative for your political tastes.  




 By studies do you mean TV cop shows and Fox news? Because everything from a legitimate source that I've read has said that while the mentally ill are no more likely to commit acts of violence than the general population, they are several times more likely to be the victims of violent crimes like rape, robbery, physical abuse, and assault. But don't take my word for it either.

 You are a police apologist. Why does it have to be the majority? Wouldn't 49% be too much? 35%? 25%? What number or percentage of innocents dead and their murderers never being charged would be acceptable to you?  




 Spoken like a true member of New York's finest.  




 my apologies for not holding the reddit message board in such high regard to be concerned with proper use of grammar. 

Now redditors may be known to make common grammatical or spelling mistakes, but the vast majority of users obviously make at least some effort in presenting their arguments and ideas in clear and correct form. What you've posted in this thread reads like the rambling drivel of an eight year old. Why even bother to post here if you're not even going to try? Why would you expect anyone to take your ideas seriously when you're not even willing to take a few extra seconds in order to present them properly? 
 




 Well stated. Sorry about the confusion.  




  That cop wasn't **just** speeding.

Did you read the words that I posted?  




 I never suggested a majority. We don't need a majority for us to say what is happening is wrong.  




 Could you please clarify what you're saying states otherwise? I flipped through all of the relevant sections and all I saw was the mention that the practice was heavily debated and a bit of anecdotal evidence about the use of the procedure in the Czech Republic.

[Here is an individual who was castrated, released early from prison by then Governor Mike Huckabee, and then came to my state to rape and murder two women.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_DuMond) 




 He learned that one from /u/Humboldtblue a little while ago.  




 I wasn't suggesting that all such incidents were the same. OP claimed that most were armed and therefore justified. I think that both of those claims are questionable. 

If you've spent any amount of time on this sub you would know that we there are countless cases where the police made a judgement call that led to the death of another person, the circumstances were suspicious, and most often the police aren't even investigated. Why should I waste my time collecting all of these stories for a police apologist who has access to the same search engines, this sub, and who won't even bother reading anyway?  




 Did you watch the James Boyd video?  




 Right, I'm sure that officers who are capable of doing the terrible stuff in this video would never do it without provocation or justification. /s 

Edit: It turns out that this man was simply riding his bike in the wrong direction. I hope you choke on a bag of huge diseased cocks.  




 And I guess to you the distinction between a person "being armed" and a person "being a threat to society" is whether or not the police decided to kill them or not?  




 Rich white women do get free contraception.

How do "rich white women" get free contraception, *and can you please explain this without using racism? 


Having bareback sex vs wearing a condom is a lifestyle choice.

What does this have to do with birth control? Who* the hell do you think you are that you can tell others what to do in the privacy of their own bedrooms and in the confidentiality of their doctors' offices? 


My family shouldn't have to sacrifice for either case.

Wtf does this even mean? Your family isn't sacrificing a damn thing. As it was already pointed out by another user, contraception is preventative treatment and is ultimately cost neutral or even represents a net savings. You're just whining because you don't feel like you're adequately getting to decide what others can and cannot do. 

Edit: was breaking a rule.

This is just a bit of what a five minute cursory Google search for "police charged with illegal guns" on my tablet turned up. There have been countless articles about police obtaining, dumping, and possessing illegal firearms on this sub, but I guess if you're only here as a police apologist you're not going to learn anything are you?  




 But yeah. Criticism of speech and cancelling of private contracts would not go against the Constitution. 

Not only that, but the businesses that severed ties with Trump have the protected right to free expression as well, and the right to not associate with or be connected to an outspoken bigot. 

 




 What about the 1st amendment rights of Trump's former business partners who don't want to be associated with an outspoken bigot? Aren't their rights to expression protected?  




 That cop wasn't just speeding. He was driving recklessly, illegally passing, and evading an officer.  




 Says the kid who likes to talk about Mario Kart on gaming subs. 

This insult was much more effective when /u/Humboldtblue used it against you 28 minutes ago.  




 That comes across as very confident. 

How many is "most"? 

Do you know for a fact that they were all armed before the police rendered them unable to speak for themselves? 

Do you know for a fact that they all brandished a weapon or attacked the police before they were forever silenced?  




 The right to bare arms is right there in the fucking constitution. 

Police shouldn't be shooting people when it's avoidable or unnecessary. What part of that do you not understand?  




 Nice.  




 Everything about this comment is fucked. "rich white woman" What the fuck is this all about? 

Birth control is anything but trivial. You consider choosing to have kids all of the time a "lifestyle choice"?  




 So exactly what I said. And your assertion that they were armed before they were shot is also disingenuous as we know damn well that officers like to carry "drop weapons". 




 Isn't New Hampshire the ~~"Give me freedom or give me death"~~ "Live Free or Die" state? Wtf?  




 Armed like [James Boyd was armed?] (https://youtu.be/JwytoxMuk4U) Or the guy who was shot to death lying in bed with a knife?  




 Recently? Women have been coming forward for decades. Now that number is up to 45. 




 There's no way to spin it. Giving mind or body altering compounds to people without their consent is wrong, a violation of their person, and a crime.  




 I disagree. I don't think that anyone should go to prison for cannabis possession or sale.  




 These types of offenders would continue to abuse children even if they were to be castrated. They would probably just become more violent and resort to using objects to carry out the abuse.  




 Computers are just tools and like other tools they made human work easier and more efficient. AI is designed to replace the human element entirely. That's a huge difference with a completely different outcome.  




 Interesting.  




 Of course they do. They don't respect anything that they can't personally buy and own.  




 The South seceded and attacked the north over the issue of slavery. The south wasn't interested in states' rights, but rather their own interests. Yes the north had the more immediate motivation of protecting the Union and therefore it's own interests. That does little to change the fact that the war was started over the issue of slavery. 

Yes slavery was less of a motivation for the Union but there were straight up abolitionists and the abolition of slavery was one of the results of the war.  




 The immediate motivations of the Union are less important considering that it was the South that chose to secede and the Confederacy that chose to attack the US.  




 Right, but in order for all that to have happened, they first needed to be convicted. These are the innocent ones we know about. They're enough to cause concern. What about those who have been executed for crimes they didn't commit?

Edit: [Cameron Willingham] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Todd_Willingham). How many dead innocents would be acceptable for you? What number or percentage do you feel would be justified in the name of political and judicial expediency? How would you feel if it was your loved one or even you on the chopping block?  




 His sworn testimony about slipping a woman drugs in order to rape her has been released. You know that there have been 46 women come out and accuse him of rape, right?  




 [Not rare enough for my taste.] (http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/innocence-and-death-penalty) There have* been at least 154 cases.  




 I understand that you don't think it exists, but you're wrong. Rude? So insulting my intelligence isn't rude? 

This was about drugging women. This is indisputable. Giving someone a mind or body altering chemical without their consent is wrong, a violation of their person, and a crime. 

He went on to drug and rape women. 

The connection is clear. It's not even a stretch.  




 You're the revisionist. Suggesting that slaves were freed by fighting for the Confederacy? If those men were free why would they fight and die defending the instrument of their own bondage? What about the white soldiers of the confederacy who were forced into conscription by the threat of death or imprisonment in terrible conditions? Do you really think that they were happy to be dying to protect the interestes of the ruling class? How do you think a black man in the slave owning confederacy would fare if he refused to fight? Toward the end of the war they were slaughtered in droves for simply not winning. 

The number of black slave owners was relatively miniscule compared to the number of slave owning whites. Why do people always bring this up? How is it even relevant?  




 I know damn well what Spanish fly is or is supposed to be. I'm telling you that this piece is relevant to the fact that he is a rapist who drugs women. Got it?  




 Not to mention that they had no problem using the federal government to force northern states to bend to their will regarding the fugitive slave acts.  




 It wasn't just a disagreement over the power of the Federal government. The South seceded and attacked the US to protect the institution of slavery and therefore the way of life for the Southern ruling elite. Ultimately the south was most upset over the creation of a new free state, Kansas. That and the election of Lincoln who opposed the expansion of slavery into new territories and states meant that the slave owning states had lost most of their political traction and their economic interests would be ignored. The Confederates weren't worried about states' rights when they opposed the formation of the new free state on the basis that slavery was an inalienable personal right that states couldn't take away. They weren't worried about states rights when they introduced and passed the fugitive slave acts and tried to force their will upon northern free states and the federal government who had no interest in capturing escaped slaves.  




 From what I understand, the formation of Kansas as a free state did play a major part of the political situation and the South's secession. Kansas and the election of Lincoln meant more representation for those who opposed slavery or at least it's expansion.  




 I said most. Most people are not rapists whether they spoke about Spanish fly or not. Most people haven't admitted to using drugs to rape women under oath. Bill Cosby isn't most people.  




 Yeah, but most people didn't end up being accused of raping 46 women.  




 I can't watch it right now. What does he say?  




 Have you figured out some way to restore life to a defendant who was unjustly executed? If not I wouldn't be so eager to kill people when we know for a fact that innocent people are often convicted of capital offenses.  




 [This guy was serving a life sentence for cannabis related offenses] (http://m.kmbc.com/news/missouri-man-serving-life-for-marijuana-offenses-gets-relief/33177190) until our governor commuted his sentence. Governor intervention is very rare.  




 I didn't say anything, but I think that OP was saying that you can usually gauge a person's overall understanding and knowledge of the Civil War by listening to their opinions on the causes of the war.  




 How do you figure?  




 The South seceded and attacked the US in an effort to protect the institution of slavery and therefore the way of life for the Southern ruling elite.  




 One of the biggest events that led to their secession was the formation of the new free state of Kansas. The Confederates felt that an individual state didn't have the legal right to prohibit slavery as it was a personal right. States' rights was a Confederate revisionist argument. The war was about preserving the institution of slavery and therefore the way of life for the Southern ruling elite.  




 That's not necessarily true. The Confederate states argued against the formation of new free states and felt that slavery was a personal right. If the confederacy was interested in supporting states' rights they wouldn't have argued that new states had no legal right to prohibit slavery. They also wouldn't have been so upset that many northern states and the federal government had failed to enforce the fugitive slave acts to their liking.  




 I get it. I was simply following the instructions in the sidebar. I'll drop the www next time, but you can't really fault someone for following the instructions in the sidebar.  




 I'll remember to drop the www next time, but you really can't fault people for following the instructions in the sidebar.  




 I wonder why it's so difficult to understand that?  




 Ahh. I see. 

Edit: I thought that you meant that someone in the thread was using the "Stalin was way worse" argument.  




 Which one is that?  




 Victory was made easier by the foolish mistakes of the Reich and other axis members. Their behavior made it very easy for allies to put aside their differences to address the malignancy that was threatening peace and order throughout the world. Germany was never close to winning the war. Japan was certainly never close to winning the war. Their military campaigns were reckless and unsustainable.  




 To a point. But when it's overused it causes economic stagnation and eventually failure. It's not a solution but a blunt tool that can often end up causing more problems than it can fix and should therefore be used sparingly.  




 The US had japan by it's balls because of the battle of Midway. Before that Japan was far more successful in the pacific. Had the US lost Midway they very well could've failed.

That's just ridiculous. The US had suffered no damage or attacks on homeland soil aside from Pearl Harbor. We were entirely intact and just getting started with our military industrial complex. Japan was suffering from repeated effective bombing campaigns and over a decade of economic sanctions and trade embargos. How do you come to the conclusion that "we very well could have failed"? 

 




 While Germany was giving the soviets a run for their money.

Really? Or did they merely succeed in causing the deaths of millions of people before having their asses handed to them, their country burned to the ground, and half of it ultimately seized by force. Let's not forget that Germany's imperialism made much of Eastern Europe vulnerable to Soviet invasion and occupation. 

 If japan had won the battle of Midway and turned around the pacific, ( which they nearly did ) the axis had strong chances of winning WW2. 

But they didn't win, and there's nothing that suggests that the US would somehow have folded if we had lost midway. Let's not forget that the US was brought into the war by the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Do you think we would have just given up and surrendered to the Japanese? Outside of Pearl Harbor, we suffered virtually none of the mass destruction that parts of Asia and Europe suffered. We were entirely intact. Yes the Japanese fought hard but there was never a chance that they were going to defeat the US. By the time we dropped the a-bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan was largely burned to the ground. 

 




 I bet I could conquer several of my neighbors houses with a bit of military equipment. I would be incompetent to do so because it's obvious that the police, the FBI, the ATF, the DHS, and the National Guard would easily take them back and likely destroy most of them in the process.  




 Well, austerity certainly doesn't foster growth.  
























 Thanks for the downvotes.  




 Maybe, or maybe it was the frank and to the point response of someone with a clouded and biased perspective. Did you read the link?  




 People are charged and convicted for everything and anything, left and right. We currently have more people incarcerated in the US than any other country in human history. 

You're obviously biased. This type of reluctance to prosecute is universal in cases involving the police. In states that require a grand jury indictment, the prosecutor purposefully includes evidence that casts doubt on the guilt of the offending police. A prosecutor would never, ever, in a million years, do this in a grand jury hearing involving a nonLEO. Prosecutors rely heavily on police departments to bring charges against offenders. They're part of the same team. They're not going to hold the police accountable anymore than they'd hold themselves accountable. They already have judges, prosecutors, grand juries, and the entire system on their side with everything they do, no matter how depraved. They don't need you on this sub sucking them off.

I'm not trying to be "edgy". I'm genuinely and rightfully angry. These men recklessly killed an innocent child. If we're to have any faith in our criminal justice system or the rule of law in this county, it's imperative that they are tried and convicted.  




 Eternal life after death is not the same as someone coming back to life after dying.

Tell that to the hundreds of millions of true believers. 

It's really not my fault that you couldn't tell a clear joke.

I explicitly asked you if you were joking. It's your fault that you assured me that you were "Not at all.". 

 




 I'm not saying any of this. 

Atheism is not an organized belief system by any definition. If you're a Christian, you're still an atheist in the fact that you do not believe in Thor, Kali, or any one of the other millions of gods that mankind has imagined throughout history. 

There is undeniably a Christian majority in the US, and I just described how they vote. Don't like it? Fine, but that doesn't make it less true.  




 There are those who honestly believe that they will granted eternal life upon their death. Don't test the levels of ridiculousness that others can reach when it comes to their belief systems. 

And again, I straight up asked you before pursuing my point. You had the opportunity to make it clear that you were joking. I can't think of any better context than that.  




 Did you remove the offending link? Maybe put in an edit explaining as much? I'm not going anywhere near those links without some type of assurance.  




 Really? So when they vote for candidates who demonize the poor, minorities, and immigrants they're considering the scripture? When they vote against healthcare reform they're considering the scripture?  




 That all depends on what one considers a state's right to be.  




 [It's Supply Side Jesus!] (https://youtu.be/Gc-LJ_3VbUA)  




 So you're arguing that what is perceived to be a failure or incompetence within the system should restore faith in said system? And what exactly do you mean by failing to execute people? My state executes inmates quite regularly.  




 Then you should have said as much when I asked you if you were being sarcastic. [Sarcasm does not translate well when conversing with strangers over the internet.] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe's_law)  




 How about plain old fucking innocent?

[Cameron Todd Willingham (January 9, 1968  February 17, 2004) was an American man who was convicted of murdering his three young children by arson at the family home in Corsicana, Texas on December 23, 1991. He was executed in 2004.] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Todd_Willingham#Post-execution_attention)  




 But, yet murder rates are unaffected. Is it possible that yours is a bullshit and/or meaningless statistic?  




 Am I joking? 

What's semi-permanent about death? 

For instance, hair dye is labeled "semi-permanent" because you can cut the dyed hair and eventually your hair will grow out as your natural color. 

Have I missed something about executions? Is there some process by which the state can restore life when it finds that it's made a "mistake".  




 Yeah, at least I'd know and at least I'd be comfortable in the fact that my animals and therefore food was treated humanely and allowed to live a healthy life.  




 You must have figured out some way of restoring life to the innocent people who have been and will continue to be unjustly executed.  




 It's not just private prisons. The whole justice system is biased as in relies on the proceeds from keeping people in  the system in order to cover payrolls and other costs.  




 Ah, the human tax that supports the justice system. The number or percentage of innocent folks that must be unjustly incarcerated or executed in order to have a "just society". The argument that causes brain cancer.  




 The difference is that people were writing about Khan and his doings during the period in which he was alive. In order for it to be an apt comparison, there would have to be no writing about him at all until after his death (which also wasn't recorded). 

I'm not interested in musings and whatnot. I'd like hard evidence like someone who wasn't illiterate having actually spoken to the man and recording his experience, or maybe some secondary sources like certification or tax records.  




 So you've discovered a way to restore life to a man or woman who has been unjustly executed?  




 So murderers can take lives, but they shouldn't have their lives taken away from them?

Maybe you should read the last line again. You seem confused. 

Nobody should have the right to legally murder someone, taking away one's greatest freedom - to live.

Murder is always wrong and the government shouldn't be murdering people. 

 




 Being put to death is semi-permanent,

Is this sarcasm?  




 I have a question. Where was god in SC, when nine of his followers were worshipping HIM in his own house?  




 Personally, I wouldn't be as worried about organic as much as I am about them being able to move around outside and being properly processed. If I had enough property outside of town i wouod already have a coop.  




 I'm going to catch that dog just so I can give it tap water.  




 Yeah but just because he was written about until after his death doesn't mean he didn't exist. 

You're not wrong, but that's still not evidence of his existence, which is what I was talking about. Personally I don't care if he existed or not being that I'm not a believer. I just don't cotton to "historical facts" which have no objective evidence supporting them. 

Pretty sure that same logic would need to be applied to genghis khan if we're being consistent.

Is this true? Did no one write about Genghis Khan while he was alive? I'm going to look that up. But undeniably there are countless cases of evidence of his existence including the DNA of his descendants. 

Edit: On second thought your claim about Genghis Khan is obviously bullshit. The man who began a campaign to conquer the world was written about extensively by enemies and allies. 


 




 Got it. I imagine it's possible that one might locate a local farmer as a source of feed at a more reasonable rate, but otherwise, I can see how it would be difficult to provide organic feed all of the time.  




 Like I said, dipshit, I'm thirty-four. You're not insulting me. You're just making mlre of an ass of your cop apologist self. Go somewhere that people can stand the presence of a kid killer's apologist. Like I said PnS is perfect for you.  




 Go to PnS. There are plenty of steroid shriveled police balls for you to suck on over there. They'll be happy to take your things from you and rape your loved ones, which apparently is what you want. So go fuck yourself.  




 This is who you have patrolling your communities armed to the teeth.  




 Sometimes ~~people~~ police do bad things that there simply are not criminal charges for.


FTFY. 
 




 Oh, okay so now you're suggesting that protocol when dealing with a **potential** gunman is to speed as close as possible and shoot without even really looking at the suspect first. I wasn't aware that the police were being trained to operate as death squads. 

I will not "chill it". I'm not fourteen, I'm thirty-four. This is a clear case of two officers, on video recklessly shooting a child, and letting him die in the grass and snow. If you want to defend these monsters go to PnS. You'll be greeted with open arms by the other murderers and robbers. I'm sure they'll even let you buy them a beer or wash their cruisers.  




 That's all very convenient for these officers, when we have teenagers serving life sentences for being involved in a burglary where one of their accomplices was shot by the homeowner. It seems to me that 85% to 95% of the time, the prosecutor gets the charges and the convictions they want. When the police kill a child in cold blood; "It's too difficult." 




 No first I said "fuck you" and described you as a "bootlicker" and as scum, then you called me an asshole to which I responded in kind. 

There's nothing intelligent about your arguments here. This case has been discussed countless times on this sub and elsewhere. You're not adding anything by wedging your nose directly between the buttocks of the nearest police office. I don't care what you think of me or my opinion. I thought I'd already made that clear. You're defending two kid killers. You have nothing useful to say. 

How dare you insinuate that I support violence against the police or anyone else. I simply pointed out that these officers need to be appropriately punished for their crimes and as a deterrent for all other officers lest they too began to treat human life with reckless indifference. Public canings are a valid type of punishment, used in countries like Singapore and such. Doing this on a live feed who simply get the message out to everyone that killing kids is not tolerated and especially by those who hide behind the authority of a badge. 
 




 You're a complete dipshit. The fact that you're even mentioning risk assessment here illustrates how biased you are. The police did not assess the risk involved in this situation. Risk assessment doesn't include positioning oneself as close as possible without first assessing the risk. 

You need to understand things dont work like they do in movies. 

Right. Tell that to these two gung-ho Dirty Harry wannabes. Don't tell me that. I'm the one arguing that police should follow protocol and consider the safety of everyone involved. 

You're a police apologist and you're here defending the indefensible. Will you be singing the same song when the police kill someone you love? You make me sick.  




 I think the evidence speaks for itself. The police abandoned protocol, recklessly sped as close to the suspect as physically possible, and proceeded to shot him multiple times. They then failed to render aid and treated his child sister like a violent criminal. There are plenty of charges that would be appropriate as well as the charge of murder. They're scum for what they did. You're* scum for defending them.  




 There are* other laws that could apply here. Criminal negligence, reckless endangerment, accomplice to murder before and after the fact. If the DA figures out a way to avoid charging them, it's not going to be because of a lack of things to charge them with.  




 Ohio is an open carry state. So it wouldn't necessarily have been illegal even if the gun was real. The police could have pulled up to the curb and used their PA to order the boy to drop the weapon and get on the gound. Instead they flew in as close as possible to surprise him and began shooting him before the car even came to a complete stop. They then refused to render aid to him as he lay gasping on the ground. They manhandled and handcuffed his younger sister and threw her in a police cruiser. 

Everything about this case is fucked. Both of the officers involved should be stripped naked and publicly flogged before being thrown in prison for the rest of their lives. They're scum for their murderous insolence. You're scum for defending them.  




 Well, in this case he wouldn't have been killed. The kid wasn't even holding the air pistol. They just murdered him because they wanted to kill a black guy. They have to be held accountable.  




 You're the asshole defending two ruthless murderers. As you may be able to tell from my comments here, I think your opinion is shit and could not care less about* what you think of me. Your lack of judgment on this very obvious brutal murder makes it clear that you have nothing useful to say.  




 Yes they're criminals. They murdered a twelve-year-old boy in cold blood. This isn't rocket science. Or do you feel safe with these jack booted thugs patrolling the neighborhood your kids play in?  




 Fuck that. They obviously didn't follow the rules to the point of recklessness and someone got killed. They deserve to be tried. If you can't get that through your thick scull then there are plenty of other subs that would love to hear your valueless opinion.  




 Fuck you. Those cops executed that kid. This is one of the most egregious examples of police brutality, but what do you know, along comes bootlicker here to defend the murderous thugs. We have every right as tax paying citizens to demand that the police follow protocol and consider the safety of everyone around.  




 Yes I have. Oddly, no one had to die.  




 Does that include cases where the officer knowingly puts himself in that situation? Ohio is an open carry state. There's no excuse for what they did here.  




 You charge them both for not following procedure, ignoring the law and the safety of the community, and murdering a twelve year old boy. 

Edit: I'd like to point out that 

Judge Ronald Adrine found probable cause for the charges of murder, involuntary manslaughter, reckless homicide, negligent homicide and dereliction of duty against Cleveland Officer Timothy Loehmann, one of the two officers involved in the case.

Additionally, the judge found probable cause for the charges of negligent homicide and dereliction of duty against Frank Garmback, the other officer.

So OP is at the very least, being disingenuous about there not being a legal basis for criminal charges in this case. This is one of the reasons why it favors the police to drag these things out as long as possible. People forget the facts and the narrative can be skewed in the court of public opinion. 
 




 It's not misleading. There still isn't any justice for Tamir Rice and his loved ones.  




 Latest? This happened long before Freddie Gray was murdered.  









 That's very true. Historians generally agree that there was a man named Yeshua. It doesn't mean that there's solid evidence. I've heard this argument hundreds of times, but I've never seen any convincing evidence. No one wrote about him during the period he would have been alive.  




 Yep. Most of the racists left the Democratic party after the Civil Rights movement.  




 Came here to say that Captain D's is far superior. Fuck Long John Silvers.  




 Yeah, fuck best buy!  




 Sounds like an interesting and depressing class.  




 Yeah. It kind of illustrates how meaningless that award is, doesn't it.  




 East Cape Girardeau is barely even a town. It's more like a couple of trailer parks and a strip club. 

Edit: typo.  




 There's much more to it than that. Read The Trial of Henry Kissingser. The guy's a fucking scumbag.  




 *mortar shell 




 No, Hard Candy is about a young girl who resorts to vigilante justice against the child predators who killed her friend.  




 Can you explain. My grandma raised chickens until all of her kids grew and moved out. I don't remember anything about it being expensive and sure cleaning chickens is work, but I wouldn't say it's the worst thing in the world. If it was expensive I can't imagine my grandparents would have had anything to do with it.  




 Not necessarily. You do have the option of raising your own chickens for meat and eggs.  




 Fuck everything about this. Sounds like another department that should be disbanded.  




 This shouldn't have been deleted. This isn't exclusively political.  




 That's sad. They can't properly celebrate murder with a memorial to the victim around.  




 How the hell does shipping meat thousands of miles away for processing and then returning it save any money?  




 You're a drooling idiot.  




 It may have something to do with the municipality. Walmart gets a lot of money for development and tax breaks from. local communities. I imagine that that some cities want to see a certain number of positions in return for their investments.  




 Employers have every right to prohibit their employees from even using tobacco products. You don't have to be a police officer. You can choose to find work in a different industry.  




 No, your job should prohibit you from using steroids and most mind altering chemicals.  




 Summary execution.  




 Right, without the government there would be multiple providers. Except that's not true at all. Without government there would be one provider still and we would not have the internet. 

 




 What the hell are you talking about?  




 No, it's definitely [corporatism] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporatism) responsible here. 

Statism is such a broad term* it would almost seem like it was created for the Republican party. It wasn't. It refers to this:

We don't have that in this country. We have many industries that aren't properly regulated in this and many other areas. We've allowed the ruling class to rule both the economy and the political process.  




 I like what you have to say. I see no reason why a combination of software and hardware can't do better than 80%. That's a disturbing number considering that there are laser corrective machines that basically correct ones vision to 20/20. 




 Yeah let me rephrase that.  




 You're talking about laser surgery. We were talking about laser diagnostics.  




 I would prefer it never had any public funding. I don't care what stupid people do **in their homes and churches** as long as they pay their taxes. 

Edit:added bold text.  




 Violence always begets violence. 

I would argue that fascist policies and horrific circumstances have put religious fundamentalists, who are sometimes also rapists, in power in Afghanistan . I don't know enough about Afghanistan to form the most well rounded argument. If I had to chance a guess about the current political, social, or economic situation there, I would start with the total war that has occurred there in the last forty years or so. Then i would move on to the intermittent and half-assed efforts (if even that) at rebuilding and supporting those people you hate. This dipshittery comes from mostly people you think are superior, they were the major parties from the beginning to our current untenable situation. 

[Afghanistan] (http://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Afghanistan) has a long and beautiful history that is both multicultural and worth learning about. What has happened there is truly horrific. But, it's easy to knock a place and a people because of its current situation. 

I mean the best time to assess the United States and it's cultural developments would have been in the last third of the Civil War, right?

 I have it in my android keyboard. It depends on your platform. Gee, [LMGTFY.] (https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20100402193438AA42qqB)  




 I dunno, you tell me.  




 The visual information that comes from your eyes is more fucked up than you think. It's not that we have too many receptors in the middle of the eye, or even the fact that we have an [actual blind spot in the middle of each eye] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_spot_(vision)). As far as I understand it, it's the complexity of the eye's shape, the photo receptors, and how they interrelate to the brain. We unfortunately possess much of the same eye structure of that of a fish. Of course light works differently underwater* and so does pressure.  




 Explain to me OP, how this is more of a failure of the president than it is the legislature. Each time a reasonable bill is presented to properly fund any amount of reform, the GOP dominated legislature slashes and trims it* into ineffectualism. It's convenient to attack the president, but a little research will reveal to you that the bill he supported was defeated and replaced with a joke that provides one tenth of the funding as was intended.  




 Antitrust!? That's socialism!!  




 We have and continue to do so. The depth of that problem is abysmal.  




 Corporatism in action.  




 I wouldn't either, but I certainly wouldn't blame Islam solely for their fucked up behavior and beliefs, anymore than I would blame my mother and her religion for the ku klux klan.  




 No one is perfect. Hitchens was antitheistic. Islam is an easy target. In some locations Islam is the major religious threat to rationalism and secular society. But, in mine for example, Southeast Missouri, Christianity threatens secularism and rational decision making.  




 How do you figure?  




 This kind of shit is why I'm in other threads arguing against blanket incarceration.  




 If you feel it did then I'm satisfied.  




 You should know about [Poe's Law.] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe's_law)

I have no love for any religion but I like people and I have a few friends who are Muslim. Seem like regular guys to me. They appreciate the secular aspect of our government and treat me, an atheist, with the same respect and dignity as anyone else.  




 I think I understand what you're getting at, though I disagree with the analogy of eating dogs as there are valid arguments against that, I think I agree with you. 

Really, I am glad they're offended. I'm offended each time a child is taught about hell and how they and everyone they love is going there if they fail to live up to "god's will". I'm offended by their often successful attempts to push religious indoctrination into science class or any other aspect of public education. I'm offended by the mutilation that was perpetrated on me and  the other **billions of defenseless children**. I'm offended by their attempts to subvert our secular government. I'm offended by their lack of humanity, tolerance, and compassion. 

If they choose to be offended by two adults who love each other and want to make it official, then shame on them. They're only showing their own asses. History will not be kind.  




 I've said multiple times that I don't disagree with a reasonable sentence in an appropriate facility in this case. Maybe you should read through the thread a bit before commenting. 

Edit: Since you so cowardly deleted the comment I'll ask your question again and answer it. 

OP: "I don't disagree" is vague, do you think that this ruling might have been correct? 

I do. 

I'm not a Swede. I'm not one of the Swedish caseworkers, judges, lawyers, or jurors involved in this case. I dont know this young man who was a minor child when he committed this heinous crime. I don't know his background, his medical history, or what types of horrors or abuses he was exposed to in Somalia. I don't think that you fit any of these qualifications either. But, now that you're asking me questions again, I'll repeat myself:

Why do you feel like you have the qualifications to argue about this one way or another? 

Why do you feel that this sub is the place to do it, especially when rule 2 prohibits this kind of agenda? 

You know you can go to /r/lolmorbidreality, right? I'm pretty sure that their rules would allow you to hate on anyone you like.  




 I've never worn contacts and probably never will. I don't mind glasses, as long as I can get a prescription as often as I need. I'm seem to be in need of a new pair as lines are starting to slant a bit. I don't understand the allure of contacts. I can't stand touching my eyes and eye infections are terrible.  




 I'm an American. Criticizing the government is what we do. How is it hypocritical to criticize my own government when it is known to be draconian in the implementation of its laws? How is it hypocrisy to appreciate another country who is taking a different approach. Maybe you're confused about the definition of hypocrisy:

hypocrisy

hpkrs/

noun

the practice of claiming to have moral standards or beliefs to which one's own behavior does not conform; pretense.

synonyms:dissimulation,false virtue,cant,posturing,affectation,speciousness,empty talk,insincerity,falseness,deceit,dishonesty,mendacity,pretense,duplicity;More

That should clear up any confusion that you're experiencing.  




 I'm assuming that you've only read the two posts that you've responded to. Shame on you. I've said multiple times that I don't disagree with a reasonable sentence in some sort of youth correctional facility. But either way, it's not our decision to make. 

I have a couple of questions for you? Why do you feel like you have the qualifications to argue about this one way or another? Why do you feel that this sub is the place to do it, especially when rule 2 prohibits this kind of agenda? You know you can go to /r/lolmorbidreality, right? I'm pretty sure that their rules would allow you to hate on anyone you like.  




 Cool, thanks.  




 I dunno. Ask /u/abortionaut. He seems to be all for it. I'm sure he'd take a page or two from the works of Adolf Hitler and his Third Reich.  




 I'm not sure what you're getting at. I personally think this kid should have to do a couple of years in juvenile or some kind of Center for youth offenders. But it's not my decision to make. 

What happened to that girl is terrible and the offender needs to be dealt with. I'm assuming you're an American by your vengeful attitude and you posting this shitty article that mentions Anders Breivik as if he was somehow relevant to this case. Perhaps you can put your thirst for blood aside and consider the long term consequences of incarceration and what goals are ultimately meant to be achieved.  




 Fine points. I agree that education needs to be the foundation if we're going to effect any real change in the US. More needs to be done to eliminate the root causes of poverty itself, which are manifold. I know a lot of conservatives like to cite welfare programs as creating a culture of dependency, but I think that's disingenuous. 

We have for several decades, fostered a very lucrative black market for several plants and compounds that we know will always command a certain level of demand. Instead of allowing criminal individuals and organizations to profit from these markets we should decriminalize, legalize, and heavily regulate even the most illicit substances. (It's ironic that the federal government still views cannabis as one of the most dangerous compounds known to mankind) A good example of the effects of sufficient regulation and taxation would be the [trend of teen smoking] (http://www.hhs.gov/ash/oah/adolescent-health-topics/substance-abuse/tobacco/trends.html) over the last forty years or so. 

I know this may sound simplistic initially, but it can be done. And yes, I'm talking about the legalization and heavy regulation of stuff like heroin and meth. You may or may not know that in much of the country we already give addicts methadone and other analogues to heroin in very strict and supervised environments. Methadone is not demonstrably safer or less addictive than pharmaceutical heroin. Hell, methamphetamine is a prescribable medication under US law, and we prescribe Adderall and other amphetamines to children (which I do not advocate. I'm just pointing out the hypocrisy and ineffectiveness of our draconian drug laws) 

If all of these things were reasonably and inexpensively obtainable under rationally controlled and supervised conditions, it would render black markets unprofitable. In the meanwhile, we can actually address the problems by requiring counseling and offering treatment to addicts. Dismantling the drug cartels and offering a safe and controlled environment for addicts takes them out of their comfort zones. I can't imagine many people saying to themselves "I've never had it so, I'd like to go down to the clinic and try some heroin or crack". But, I'd prefer that if they felt that strongly about it, they had access to a clinic with mandatory counseling and safe conditions rather than being fodder for pimps and other types of undesirables in flop houses and whatnot. Prohibiting drugs puts drugs in the hands of criminals. I hear this argument in regards to gun legislation all of the time but rarely do I hear a rational proposition for dealing with our country's drug problems. 

 




 I'm not sure what you're getting at, but what does race have to do with this?  




 I don't disagree, but there was no murder in this case.  




 Where in the text does it say that we have an inalienable right to own and bear assault rifles or even pistols?  We have a Supreme Court to interpret the text of the constitution. I'm not accusing you personally of this, but I think it's odd how some find it convenient to forget the way the system works when they're faced with a ruling that they disagree with. 

All of this hullabaloo about gay marriage is extremely odd to me considering how it literally affects no one but LGBT people and their immediate families. This has absolutely no effect on Christians, their churches, or their closely held beliefs.  




 Let's hope she finds a better job in a substantially less hateful environment.  




 We do. And we have a longstanding court defined by that document to interpret those rights. They've ruled some fifteen times that, while not explicitly mentioned in the text, the right to marry the person of choice is covered in the protections enumerated by the constitution.  




 Christian conservatives and other prolifers.  




 He* grew up in New Madrid, MO. That's just down the road from here. My grandparents lived there for a time when I was young.  




 It seems kinda sad. I know they were violent criminals, but I didn't realize that they would be denied a proper grave this way. Not that I'm saying it's wrong. It's just surprising.  




 I've experienced some of that. The last time I got a new prescription, I hadn't been wearing glasses for a few months because they were broken. When I received the new pair my tablet appeared to be a slight trapezoid instead of perfect rectangle for a couple of weeks. I had to be careful going up and down stairs. Thanks for the info, Doc.  




 Nor should marriage lose its privileged state. The sanctions and privileges afforded to married couples are there to support social stability, family planning, and child rearing. I can't think of a single reason these things shouldn't be available to gay couples as well as straight couples. It's good for families.  




 If it's an issue of a personal inalienable right, which the right to marry the person of choice certainly is, it's not up to the state whether it should be allowed or not.  




 Marriage is a legal term. It's been one for quite some time.  




 No you're right /u/abortionaut. We should look at statistics on crime and race, ignore all other socioeconomic factors at play, round up the offending ethnicities, and put them in camps and deport them. /s

Edit:grammar  




 I'm glad it offends him. He like everyone else, needs to learn that we as Americans do not have a right to not be offended by things, and especially not the freedom of others.  




 Which is right up Rand Paul's alley.  




 That's nonsense. Race doesn't make a person more likely to commit crimes.  




 So they give out that information to visitors?  




 I have astigmatism and slight nearsightedness and it seems like they can never get my glasses right. I put up with it and just wear them. My wife is the same way. Would I be better off just asking for this procedure? Is it expensive?  




 Looking back at your comments, I'm curious as to why you chose to focus on that study while ignoring the definition of recidivism provided at the top of the page in question. 

Recidivism is one of the most fundamental concepts in criminal justice. It refers to a person's relapse into criminal behavior, often after the person receives sanctions or undergoes intervention for a previous crime. Recidivism is measured by criminal acts that resulted in rearrest, reconviction or return to prison with or without a new sentence during a three-year period following the prisoner's release.

Is it because this very relevant definition hurts your argument, and the study works as a fantastic distraction from that fact?  




 Who said anything about giving anyone a pass? I'm saying that it's wrong to suggest that someone is a criminal because of their religious background. Not that it's okay to assume* that everyone who is religious is a criminal or to give anyone a pass. I guess I could link to the strawman Wikipedia article here if I wanted to be a condescending jerk.  




 Did you even read the article?  




 Excellent article. Priceless photo of Trump.  




 What's conservative or short sighted about opposing an ideology that is inherently anti-women and anti-gay? 

You mean like Christianity? 

 




 Are you suggesting that there is racial profiling being perpetuated against white folks?  




 It's not exactly accurate. It isn't a person's race that makes them commit crimes.  




 Interesting post. I was surprised to learn that these graves don't even have names on their markers. I understand the purpose in burying them in this manner, but shouldn't the families still allowed to locate and visit their deceased loved ones?  




 I don't disagree that culture is part of it. But it's difficult to tackle the problems presented by cultural backgrounds without first addressing poverty, education, and other socioeconomic factors. It's not like one can strip a person of their cultural background nor should they. There are absolutely aspects of some cultures that are harmful to women and other minorities. It's a difficult problem to address. I guess the idea is that once a person or group is appropriately educated and raised from poverty, these other issues should take care of themselves. I don't disagree that there is a certain amount of assimilation that can and should be expected from immigrants entering a country.  




 It's not relevant as I am an American and have every right to expect to have a say in the functions of my Democratic Republic. I'm not saying that you can't have an opinion about Sweden. I'm saying that it's unqualified and valueless so don't expect anyone to listen to it or care. You have no authority there. Not even a vote. 

You have no reason to label me a hypocrite. 

And I will continue to live in the US and vote in every election cycle, thank you very much.  




 Why would I be arguing about Saudi Arabia? How is that relevant to this discussion? 

I'm comforted by* the fact that you have no authority on* any of these topics and cannot enact your draconian will upon others. 

You didn't address the fact that here in the US, we frequently toss juvenile offenders into adult prisons where they are habitually beaten, raped and otherwise abused for much of their adult lives. I'm assuming that this fact doesn't bother you. 

Please don't talk to me about morality or what is just.  




 This "man" was a 17 year old juvenile offender.  




 Again, you're missing the point. Without a control group, like people who received community service and probation, such research only shows part of the pictures. 

Also this study has no effect on the definition of the term. An offender doesn't have to have spent time in prison in order to be considered a repeat offender. That's just obvious.  




 It may not be common knowledge, but those suffering from mental illness are statistically no more likely than the general population to commit acts of violence. The truth is that* the mentally ill are several times more likely to be the victims of violent crimes like rape, robbery, physical abuse, and assault. 

I don't think anyone would argue that this crime is excused by whatever psychological issues he may be experiencing, but there's no question that such things should be considered during sentencing.  




 That's one study. Not all research on recidivism would only follow exprisoners. That would be a mistake as there would be nothing to compare the recidivism rates of prisoners vs other types of punishment.  




 recidivism


\ri-si-d-vi-zm\noun

:a tendency to relapse into a previous condition or mode of behavior;especially:relapse into criminal behavio


http://www.nij.gov/topics/corrections/recidivism/pages/welcome.aspx

It's generally used to describe a return to criminal behavior. Obviously we shouldn't be returning people to prison who haven't done anything wrong, right?  




 I am American and I firmly believe our system is worse than backward. It's completely counterproductive and criminal in and of itself. Our penal system has a long track record of making criminals more depraved and incapable or rehabilitation. 

Sure just punishment is warranted, but you could hardly argue that throwing juveniles into adult prison to be abused, beaten, and raped to be "just punishment" without some serious cognitive dissonance. What's the point in punishing offenders in a way that denies their humanity and violates our own? It doesn't change the past, and the end result is an offender who's more fucked up psychologically and less capable of functioning and participating in society.  




 The duty is to all of society, not only the immediate victim. Yes prison is usually necessary in the case of rape. I wouldn't argue with that point. I will argue that's it's not your place or mine to decide what judges, juries, and lawyers should do with a juvenile offender in their own sovereign state. If Sweden prefers the focuses of their criminal justice system to be on providing aid to victims, rehabilitating offenders, and preventing recidivism  then that's their right.  




 If anything, recidivism rates should be higher in a system where only the most serious criminals end up in prison in the first place.


I'm not convinced that Sweden has such a system. This offender was a juvenile under their legal definition. For better or worse this is why he avoided prison time. And why would they be higher? Recidivism is about reoffending not about returning to prison.  




 If you're not willing to rely on facts or provide any sources, why do you insist on being involved in this discussion?  




 You're assuming so much with your statements. First and foremost, you're assuming that you have the knowledge, understanding, and authority to be making decisions about what should be done to this juvenile offender in a foreign country. Because he's an immigrant you're assuming that he's not a citizen. 

I don't disagree that a sexual offender deserves prison time. But I don't assume to be qualified or justified in telling a foreign sovereign state how to handle its internal affairs.  




 I don't disagree that there should be a focus on protecting the innocent. But it's not up to you or I to decide whether this juvenile offender is likely to reoffend or not. What are they going to keep him in prison for the rest of his life? That doesn't seem appropriate or necessary. 

Also, your comment violates rule 2 in the sidebar which I politely invite you to read.  




 From the way I understand it, Breivik will most likely be in prison for the rest of his life. That 21 year sentence is the "punishment" for his crimes, but the way his sentence works is that the state can choose to keep him behind bars if he's deemed to still be a threat to society. 

Edit: It's worth pointing out that Breivik and his crimes were in Norway.  
























 I disagree with that assertion. Once an officer draws his firearm, there are few if any options other than shooting and killing his target. They're equipped with tasers, pepper spray, batons, and other options.  




 You explicitly claimed to have taken it. I don't know why anyone would believe you after you blatantly and needlessly lied like that. This photo was posted in this sub twelve hours before your post.  




 Thanks for the info. 

He wasn't being unruly. He was sitting down holding a camera with both hands. They definitely could have done more to communicate and reason with the guy. You can say it was justified all you want, but if that old man (as cantankerous and obnoxious as he is) were to have been shot and killed, or anyone else in that room had been shot and killed, all of this would have been a moot issue. Those guards are there to protect everyone in that room and they undoubtedly failed.  




 Thanks. I apologize for my hateful remarks too. 

You didn't specify the person was mentally ill. You're moving the goalposts here dude. 

This is how that situation works. You either give him the benefit of the doubt and treat him like a human being, or you find out about his mental health issues when he's already on ice. I understand that officer safety is important, but the people you encounter each day are just that, people. I've argued with officers on here that felt that the shooting of James Boyd was completely justified. It's easy for me to get worked up when I think I'm talking to someone with no respect for human life. 
 




 Was he OP? When "you took this picture"? I understand reposting, but was it really necessary to claim that you're the one who actually took the photo and fabricate some bullshit story about it? 

**OP is a big fat phony!!** 




 Yes, the internet must ensure that never goes away.  




 The deleted comment below was the one in which OP claimed that he took this photo. 

**OP is a big fat phony!!** 




 **OP is a big fat phony!!** 




 There's not a snowball's chance in hell. If anything, this frothy mixture is a walking talking advertisement for the Democratic party.  




 Source? Everything I've read said he wasn't arrested or charged. 

Regardless, that security guard fucked everything up here. He didn't announce himself or his intentions. He went right for the camera that was strapped to the man's neck. Obviously anything related to the neck is going to trigger a fight or flight response as well as involuntary reactions. There's not a single excuse for the guard's lack of communication. He went directly to physical violence. He had no justification to put his hands on that man or his property. That guy is an unprofessional hack. Police officers (and apparently ex police officers) are violent thugs. When you're a hammer, everything looks like a nail.  




 Clearing rooms and using a firearm as a compliance device are two different things.  




 I wasn't talking about this video. I was talking about the aforementioned scenario. 

If someone was an actual threat and unwilling to listen to reason, and I had backup, a taser, and pepper spray. I would start with the taser. Two adult men in reasonable shape with multiple "less lethal" options should be able to disable and restrain a suspect. If not, then keep him at bay until more help can arrive. There's also [this] (http://www.slashgear.com/police-test-less-lethal-bullet-alternative-17369435/) and other stuff like it. There's no reason to go straight for lethal weaponry when dealing with unarmed American citizens.  




 I cry afoul because often times the police are lying when they say a subject tried to grab their gun or otherwise. 

He did break the law. An actual cop cannot take your camera. This guy is a private security guard. The fact that he broke the law was illustrated by the fact that old man wasn't arrested or even detained.  




 It's not the printing presses that should fund the basic income. If you'd read a bit about the topic, you'll find that it's perfectly viable through progressive taxation. It's going to be necessary too, because soon enough no one will be able to afford any of the products that capital produces.  




 I dunno, that piece of shit was trying to steal his camera, and it looked like the old man got a few good licks in. I know I'd rather not get my face beat in by a geriatric.  




 Thank you for your simple explanation as to how you'd justify killing a mentally ill person. You're a fucking coward. 

Edit: Make sure you take a screen shot of this comment to show all of your buddies.  




 You're in /r/basicincome, so you should be able to guess what my solutions would be. 

Your solutions just shore up the wealth of the already wealthy. They wouldn't do anything to help the working classes.  




 That doesn't have the slightest chance of being passed. If the GOP keeps up with this level of rhetoric, they may find it impossible to pass any legislation for the foreseeable future.  




 And they use assjacks like Rick Santorum to drug you into a coma.  




 Well, I think the distinction that it's not paint or some other permanent medium is relevant.  




 That's fucked up. Put up some flour pasted posters in that decaying shithole of a town and they treat you like you've defaced the Taj Mahal.  




 You don't have my respect and I doubt you'll be earning any here by insulting other veterans. Where would grunts be without the tactical and technical assistance of others? You're a jackass and a insult to every uniform you wear. 

I'm not trying to intimidate you. I'm not like you. I'm not driven by the basest instincts and drives. 

I'm pointing out the giant holes in your logic. You're talking about being back into corners? Answer my question piggy. 

This is why you are not supposed to pull a firearm unless you fully intend to use it to kill; where do you go from there, hot shot? You have the gun pointed at someone who is unarmed and that you'd prefer not kill, and he/she doesn't comply. What do you do then? It's too late for your taser, your pepper spray, or even fisticuffs. You shoot an unarmed person because you chose to over escalate the situation. 


You're talking about killing your way out of corner you created for yourself. There's no honor in needlessly killing unarmed people.  




 Yup. It's called the constitution. The Supreme Court has ruled fifteen times that, while not explicitly mentioned in the text, the right to marry the person of choice is covered by the protections enumerated in the constitution. 

Edit: forgot a few key words.  




 Man, fuck you. Every veteran has earned the respect of the uniform they wore and the service they provided to their country. You're a fucking scumbag. 

You're already getting combat veterans here arguing with you. I'd quit while I was ahead if I were you. 

Edit: Also why don't you answer the question in my other comment? Where do you go from there, officer pigshit?  




 Yes during the initial invasion you guys were obviously on the offensive. But afterward things changed right? And like you said, that was war. 

It seems after taking another look at your comment we're really on the same side.  




 No. Taxes are not too high. American effective tax rates aren't any higher than most other places. And instead of creating treaties and agreements that make things easier for these guys, we should be creating international agreements to reign in tax havens and hold these companies accountable. Apple is doing that because, as of yet, there haven't been any meaningful repercussions for doing so. It's time we started making these assholes pay for the things they do.  




 My thoughts exactly. Doesn't Shepard Fairy just do posters? Is an internationally acclaimed artist putting up posters in their post apocalyptic city really an appropriate use of police resources?  




 I am a veteran. I did not see combat but I was trained to use a firearm. How dare you insult my service or the service of anyone else simply because we had different specialties. Fuck you pig. 

The combat veterans I know have explained that they had very strict rules of engagement. Nothing like the bullshit the police get away with here. I'm sure within a few hours some other veterans will add to this.  




 Oh, C'mon man. Of course an officer has the same right as anyone else to defend himself. If someone actually attacks an officer or tries to tear something out of their hands that obviously warrants the use of force. Use of force  equal to beating the shit out of someone 

That rarely happens. Usually the officer is the aggressor. There are countless videos on here of cops trying to steal people's cameras and assaulting them. Cops purposefully engage a person in a way that elicits an involuntary response. Like putting their hands on and pushing people in the chest or neck. Grabbing a person's extremities and bending them in a way that forces your body to react. 

Don't give me this bullshit that people aren't being fair to cops. The asshole in the video blatantly walked over to the elderly gentleman and grabbed his camera which was around his neck. What did he expect to happen when he broke the law, violated this man's person, and tried to steal his property?  
























 Yes, it's a development. Granted it's a depressing development that doesn't progress the prosecution of these killers, but it's definitely a development. You are an idiot. You shouldn't talk to people about things or post comments on the internet about topics that you're not willing to read about. When you do this, you waste everyone's time, including your own.  




 Computers aren't responsible for wage stagnation. 

Fly away executive pay and income inequality are the result of the regression of our tax system. We removed the disincentives for insane levels of executive pay when we pulled back the top marginal tax rates. Our tax system is effectively regressive at this point. Executives can command unlimited levels of pay and neither they nor their employers face any tax penalties. So naturally that's where all of the new revenue is going to go. This has also resulted in wage stagnation so it's no coincidence that wage stagnation began in the late seventies/early eighties when the top marginal tax rates were effectively neutered.  




 Again did you read the fucking article? 

It's a development because a group of activists tried using an obscure state law to circumvent the regular grand jury process to bring charges against the officers. This story is about how that process failed and their affidavit was dismissed even though the initial judgement was that there was probable cause to bring multiple charges. Now it's up to the DA to bring charges and it doesn't look good. 

Read the article you fucking putz.  




 That's just pure incompetence. I don't know if they're using this bullshit to sell papers or just distract the public from real news like the TPP, but they should be ashamed of themselves.  




 I'm more curious about whether the other user is full of shit.  




 He's eager to kill.  




 Where did you find this because a different user posted the exact same picture and claims that he took it. 

Edit: yeah, turns out that the other user was full of shit.  




 Oh, I know he is. Pretty pathetic if you ask me. 

Edit: We did it. Op backed out of his initial claim that he took the photo.  




 What you're saying isn't wrong, but it doesn't explain the wage stagnation of the last 30+ years.  




 You have a valid point. I really doubt this is actually his photo anyway.  




 Maybe a ruling with a settlement that actually hurts the system will be cause for change. $5 million isn't shit for the bureaucrats in NYC.  




 It doesn't look good does it? I dunno, I'll give OP at least an hour before I make a decision.  




 This is why you are not supposed to pull a firearm unless you fully intend to use it to kill; where do you go from there, hot shot? You have the gun pointed at someone who is unarmed and that you'd prefer not kill, and he/she doesn't comply. What do you do then? It's too late for your taser, your pepper spray, or even fisticuffs. You shoot an unarmed person because you chose to over escalate the situation.  




 You're confused because those of us in the military and the general public are trained to treat firearms with respect and to only use them for their intended purpose which is to kill people and animals. 

We don't get the "gun as a deadly compliance device" training.  




 That's not true.  




 Is this actually your photo? 

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut/comments/3d2l8a/lafayette_indiana_cop_parks_in_handicap_spot/

This was posted 12 hours before your post.  




 How is anything that I said disrespectful? Did you read the article?  




 Right, the ruling class aren't properly compensating their employees because of the gold standard. Der.  




 I imagine a swab is all that's necessary. They're trying to establish origin.  




 You understand that it's a movie right?  




 This is a new development in an old case. Do you ever read the article?  




 Well, they certainly weren't condemning it* either. There's at least one law enforcement rapist story posted here daily. Quite a few of the victims are children. 

So you really just guessed?  




 There are no accidents involving firearms and trained professionals. Weapons don't fire themselves.  




 That's $51k to $66k with next pay grade being $61k to $79k. Let's not forget housing allowance, COLA, medical and dental coverage, an amazing retirement package, incredible job security, and a bunch of other benefits. It's not like they're the most under paid people in the world.  




 Right, and they don't deserve to be individually doxxed.  




 I would delete this comment if I were you. Just a heads up, this is grounds for a shadowban.  




 Oh, he must be one of those "bad apples" I'm always hearing about.  




 Okay too many commas. It's not worthy of all of hate you're giving it.  




 Maybe he shouldn't have attempted to steal the man's camera.  




 [Yes, it did happen.] (http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/07/nypd-sergeant-throws-semen-on-his-crush.html)  




 Yeah no shit. Wouldn't it makes sense to compare Bates to Gein and not the other way around? 

Edit: Why am I being downvoted? Bates is a **fictional character** based loosely upon Gein the **real person**. 




 Yet another Southerner here. I grew up with the Dukes of Hazzard. To me, it says good 'ol boys who never meant no harm. Yeah, it's the Rebel flag, but that's the point. It's rebellion. IMO, it would be extremely appropriate if someone used it in a protest against the NSA.


Jesus Christ, did he read any of the arguments against it?  




 That's a book, not a peer reviewed study. 

Edit: added a comma.  




 Oh c'mon, man. That quote can from an AARP blog post that provided no sources and no statistics. Those people choosing to be with different types of partners doesn't mean they went from gay to straight. 

The second link was to a study on sexual plasticity. I wasn't asking for proof of sexual plasticity. I was asking for a source on your claim:

There are a non-trivial amount of cases of gay people becoming "straight" 




 Well we certainly shouldn't be publicly funding a program that largely confuses kids and fails to meet its main goal.  




 This needs publicity and awareness. People need to be reminded about what they get by voting Republican.  




 There are a non-trivial amount of cases of gay people becoming "straight"

Source? 

 




 I was talking about the next smart ass comment. 

They lost the war. Sorry for being so ~~brunt~~ blunt and I do accept the downvotes.

+117

It's because "they lost", and not because they weren't heroes, but instead murderous brutes.  




 It doesn't matter where you are sugar, it's your bedtime. Goodnight.  




 I'm in a predominantly red state, Missouri, and I'm not opposed to Medicaid expansion or subsidies, but I can confirm that is a very common view point. It's odd too, because from what I gather it seems to be largely motivated by misinformation and outright lies. Most people don't actually understand how Medicaid expansion or subsidies work.  




 "And I do accept ze downvotes for mein Fatherland, mein Reich and mein Fhrer!" 




 So the wealthy don't pay into and then receive social security when they retire? No, everyone gets social security. It's not like wealthy people have ever been known to turn down extra money.  




 I'm not a lawyer. I'm a taxpayer and a voter. I'm not trying to convince you of anything. I'm simply stating my opinion. You're obviously as firm in your convictions as I am.  




 And what do you know, yours began with and has been sustained solely on personal attacks. Now run along to bed. You don't want your mom to take away your internet privileges.  




 How clever. Go to sleep. It's past your bedtime.  




 If you looked at my initial comment you would see that I said percentage. Keep in mind when all is said and done the Romneys are left with more than $11 million to live on whereas the median income family is out more than a fifth of their living expenses (that's right, not just their incomes). They've contributed a fifth of their living expenses (that's food taken out of mouths, medicine and doctors visits that have to be skipped, necessities like a new roof or a new transmission that they'll somehow make do without) and you and Romney call them lazy and moochers. 

You are a simple child. You have no business discussing these things. Go to bed kiddo. 

Edit: your numbers are wrong. The total tax on the median family $10k. Which means that the Romneys pay 213 times that of the median family, which would make sense considering that they take home 282 times the income.   




 I'm done with you. You make claims and haven't provided a single source. To my sources you simply say "that didn't exist" or "that doesn't happen". Sure you can simulate the experience of winning an argument by never actually providing one. You're willfully ignorant and dangerously dense. Furthering this discussion is a waste of my time. Good night.  




 You dismissed my example and then provided one that you're certain needs to die. You're saying an innocent dead man isn't relevant because *you know* this other one is guilty. My argument is that there's no way to know. As I pointed out before, everyone *knew* that Willingham was guilty.  




 So you're saying that it's okay if the Willinghams die as long as we get to kill the Roofs? 




 No, they pay [around 20%](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/01/18/us/effective-income-tax-rates.html) give or take, and I just posted a pretty clear explanation as to how a family earning the median American income can end up paying more than that.  




 Hehe. Thesaurus. Good one.  




 You obviously don't understand how sales taxes work.

Lets take the Romneys. I just read that he paid 14.1% on his income of $13.7 million. That's $1,931,700 in taxes leaving them with $11,768,300. Now how much do you think the Romneys need to live? Let's be generous and say they **spend** $2,000,000. Sales taxes are usually between 8% and 12% so let's just go with an even ten percent. That would be around $200,000 putting their total tax at $2,131,700. Or 15.5% their annual income. 

Let's do this with a median income family. The link I sent you puts their effective tax rate at 12.7% of $50,000 or $6,350 leaving them with $43,650. Now, a family of three or four will most likely spend every cent on living expenses just to survive. So assuming they spend all $43,650, $4,365 is going to go to sales taxes. Leaving them with $39,285 making their total tax rate around 21.5%. 

See how it works when you present an actual argument instead of dismissing and insulting people with no supporting evidence?  




 Because you're a bootlicking apologist and your only concern is defending the police and obfuscating the topic at hand.  




 That's why I said this has nothing to do with the gold standard.  




 **The tactics of racial profiling,**

Not at all nice, but not equivalent to genocide. 

We're not talking about genocide. That was clarified more than once. Try to focus, will ya. 


**warrantless searches,**


Cops generally aren't allowed to do this. 

It's called stop and frisk, and it happens in most major cities. 


**civil forfeiture,**


What's wrong with civil courts?

You should read about the practice of [civil forfeiture. ] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_forfeiture_in_the_United_States) It has little to do with civil courts or justice. It's state sponsored theft. 


**military tactics**


What are "military tactics?" That term means nothing unless you define it. 

Using military uniforms, weapons, and equipment on civilian populations. Storming private residences before dawn. Etc


**secret police**


I wouldn't call US police "secret" given their habit of dressing in clearly noticeable vehicles and running around in marked cars. 

US drug task forces are most definitely secret police. They dress as civilians and drive unmarked vehicles. They're allowed to break all sorts of laws in their pursuit of suspects and convictions. For someone who really wats to argue about this topic you sure are ignorant. 


**criminal informants,**


Who's going to know what criminals are up to? Think very carefully. I know it's hard, but I think you can answer this question.

Criminal informants are [people and often children] (http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/09/03/the-throwaways) with substance abuse or other problems who are extorted into doing police work at their own peril and expense. 


**black site interrogations**


American police don't do this. 

[This is getting really old, man] (http://www.rawstory.com/2015/03/chicago-police-commander-who-ran-homan-square-black-site-quits-amid-new-lawsuit-threat/) You're aware that you can do your own research, right? Your ignorance is your own responsibility. 


**warrantless surveillance**


So what? 

Really? You're perfectly fine with this? Do you not understand how historically, this sort of thing does not end well. 


**no-knock raids**


So what? 

[This is on example of what these lead to.] (http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/07/us/georgia-toddler-stun-grenade-no-indictment/) If the evidence being sought can be destroyed in a matter of five minutes then theres no excuse for using a swat team and violating the rights of a suspect. If they're looking for a person they can get a warrant and surveil the premises until they locate them, or you know, "do their fucking jobs". 


**summary executions**


US police don't do this. 

US police kill at least one person every eight hours. Plenty of them have been summary executions. [James Boyd] (https://youtu.be/JwytoxMuk4U), [Tamir Rice] (https://youtu.be/mSCftESyKyU) are a couple of examples. 


**character assassination, and propaganda campaigns waged against their own citizens,**


Or either of these things for that matter. 

During the Baltimore protests the police fabricated and disseminated falsehoods about Freddie Gray and other Baltimorians. Every time there is a police shooting the first thing the police do is release the victims criminal history regardless of how irrelevant or unsubstantiated it may be. In absence of any character damning information, they go after the victims friends, family, and associates. 


**It's about understanding the underlying causes and conditions that explain why things happened and how they happened.**


A lot of people in Germany didn't like Jews. 

Oh that's true. But there's much more to it and there's is a lot to compare to the US. In case you haven't noticed, we have a few problems with racial tensions and race relations in this country. Most of the people who are targeted as an excuse for the increasing militarization of the police are racial and ethnic minorities. We also have a lot of economic problems that can be used to antagonize racial issues. If you can't see some similarities here, then you should find a different past time because you don't get history at all. 


**Those tactics were instrumental in the creation of the environment in which the totalitarian regime was able to commit some of the most heinous war crimes in modern history.**


Except they weren't. You don't need a complex bureaucracy like the Nazis had to commit genocide. As the Rwandans were nice enough to show us, all you really need are tools and men. Every nation on earth has that. 

Rwandans aren't Germans. Germany needed the complex bureaucracy, hence it's construction and maintenance. You're working from the assumption that the nazis were able to seize power solely on a general hatred for Jewish people. That's simply not true. Of course it was a factor, but Germany had gone through decades of economic turmoil and were fertile ground for fascism to take hold. Hitler promised economic recovery which he delivered via unsustainable militarization. The German people were spiteful from losing WWI and felt that they were being treated unfairly by the rest of Europe. They used this as justification for their invasion of Poland. The Jewish people weren't their only scapegoats. The Reich demonized and euthanized the disabled, Roma people, communists, and literally anyone else they deemed undesirable. Yes the Jewish Holocaust was the very pinnacle of their evil, but it's shortsighted to ignore all of their other crimes. 

 




 Way to be objective pal. Go ahead and look up [effective tax rates.] (http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/01/18/us/effective-income-tax-rates.html) You'll see that there isn't a big difference from the bottom rung and the top rung. Then you have to consider sales taxes. When a family only has an income of $50k (median American income), everything they earn is spent. When you account for sales taxes on lower income families you might as well just add that sales tax straight to their effective tax rate. When you do that you'll see that the poor often pay more than the rich.  




 You and I obviously aren't having the same conversation. Propaganda is only one of the number police tactics and  crimes that I mentioned. 

The tactics of racial profiling, warrantless searches, civil forfeiture, military tactics, secret police, criminal informants, black site interrogations, warrantless surveillance, no-knock raids, summary executions, character assassination, and propaganda campaigns waged against their own citizens, are applicable to both groups.

History isn't just about memorizing facts and figures. It's about understanding the underlying causes and conditions that explain why things happened and how they happened. Those tactics were instrumental in the creation of the environment in which the totalitarian regime was able to commit some of the most heinous war crimes in modern history. Ignoring those factors is to ignore the fundamental basis of their crimes.  




 One could argue that [righteousness is a theistic concept.] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Righteousness) 

[This guy was a case where every authority figure involved was absolutely sure of his guilt.] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Todd_Willingham) He's dead now, and things don't seem so clear cut.  




 Ahh.  




 I would hardly call that the black market, especially considering that you're allowed to buy a reasonable amount for personal use.  




 The same could be said about cannabis users today. A gargantuan black market that is present in literally every community, nation wide.  




 Actually that's untrue. The rich barely pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes and in many cases they pay less.  




 What?  




 I haven't been downvoting you, but I may now. 

"You people"? That's always a big hit. 

I'm not sure how an atheist can be "righteous".  Or that righteousness is even relevant. 

We could look at being fiscally conservative and how the death penalty and its required appeal system is simply inefficient and expensive costing tens of millions of dollars per death row inmate. 

We can look being effective and compare the murder rates of states that have capital punishment vs states that do not and conclude* that the threat of the death penalty is not an effective deterrent for capital crime. We can also acknowledge that life without parole is far worse than a death sentence as it offers no quick and easy conclusion for the condemned. 

We can look at being just and acknowledge that as many as 4% of the inmates sitting on death row were wrongly convicted. What percentage or number of innocents killed in the name of political and judicial expediency would be acceptable to you? And if those people were your loved ones or even you yourself? 

The only "rational" argument for the death penalty would be revenge, retribution, vengeance, wrath, whatever you wanna call it. But I wouldn't call it rational. It's emotional and zealous. It's about instant and total gratification not thoughtful deliberation. Not what we want or need out of criminal justice system.  




 Now? Did it ever stop being murder? Or maybe just in your mind? 

Regardless of what you think, I'd prefer the state not murder people in my name or with my tax dollars.  




 No worries.  




 Well, yeah they disarmed the jews. No argument there. They also relieved those innocent people of their personal possessions, wealth and property, and ultimately their lives. 

Not much gun control is occurring in the US. There is however a push toward the militarization of the police, a complete disregard for constitutional protections, and a general attitude that the police in general and individual officers can do no wrong.  




 Not because he was nervous, because he murdered a child.  




 Nope. Guns were banned in the 20's, but gun regulations were relaxed in 1928, five years before the rise of the Reich. [Then in 1938 gun regulations were relaxed even further.] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_legislation_in_Germany)  




 You forgot "stop needlessly violating rights and endangering lives".  




 Yes this, except for D.A.R.E. which is a complete waste of time and money, and as some studies have suggested, can actually increase the rate of teen drug abuse.  




 If the amount of evidence in question is so small that it can be destroyed in a matter of five minutes, then there's no rational argument for using a swat team to preserve the scene through brute force. Knock on the door and see what you get. There's no need to violate anyone's constitutional rights or endanger anyone's life. 

By the way, a drug dealing operation is by definition "a business".

What makes you so sure that all employers would be so willing to show up to court like you say? What makes you so certain that they too wouldn't be eager to destroy incriminating evidence? 

Why aren't the police even sending out letters to these employers? Obviously when someone works hard for hourly wages and tips and the theft of these funds constitutes a crime with an obvious victim. Why aren't the authorities zealously prosecuting these crimes?  




 Double comment.  




 And that's what this article was about. A different judge ruled that it's up to the DA to bring charges. So I'm here arguing that the system of justice should be allowed to continue through with charges. Really at this point it looks like simple biased obstruction to those of us who want to see these killers face trial.  




 No, that was a question? Don't have an answer?  




 Again, the numbers are so disproportionate that a division by 5 isn't going to do much. Like the article stated, US police have killed as many people in the last 24 days as the British have in the last 24 years. 

If you took the number that the British have killed in the last 24 years and multiplied it by five, it would be 275 over 24 years. What does that change? American police have killed more than 600 this year alone. The total number dead in the 24 years in question would be closer to 20,000 as a conservative estimate. So then you're looking at 275 (corrected for population) vs 20,000. See what I'm saying. Population correction doesn't make things look much better. Or you can go the other route and divide the US down to 4,000 (conservative estimate /5 over 24 years) for 55 vs 4,000. Still looks really really bad. 

Edit: US police kill people at a rate 72 times that of British police (corrected for population size) or 363 times without correction.  




 Maybe Hitler wasn't such a monster, he just lost who writes history, besides it was ww2. 

Right, fact. /s Makes perfect sense. 

 




 I already read what you have to say. You think these officers were justified and shouldn't face charges.

Judge Ronald Adrine found probable cause for the charges of murder, involuntary manslaughter, reckless homicide, negligent homicide and dereliction of duty against Cleveland Officer Timothy Loehmann, one of the two officers involved in the case.

Additionally, the judge found probable cause for the charges of negligent homicide and dereliction of duty against Frank Garmback, the other officer.

This judge disagrees with you.  




 Why aren't the police performing raids on employers responsible for wage theft and other labor violations?  




 I'm not trying to be "edgy". I'm genuinely and rightfully angry. First because these two spineless turds executed that boy, and now again because of apologists like you who would defend their crimes. Go to PnS. They'll let you sit in the middle of the circle jerk.  




 And that attitude is ridiculously stupid and shortsighted. It's important to recognize* all of the causes and conditions that created an environment in which they could commit such atrocities. And trust me, there are plenty of historians and otherwise who take into account the entirety of their crimes. If you want to be willfully ignorant, that's fine. Just don't expect others to accept that as a valid argument for anything.  




 Again, you should learn about this topic before rendering an opinion. The tactics of racial profiling, warrantless searches, civil forfeiture, military tactics, secret police, criminal informants, black site interrogations, warrantless surveillance, no-knock raids, summary executions, character assassination, and propaganda campaigns waged against their own citizens, are applicable to both groups. Yes, the nazis committed genocide, but that wasn't the total extent of their crimes. 

Edit: added two.  




 Right. It's naive to consider the whole picture rather than rushing to judgement as a result of bloodthirsty vengeance. If you had anything useful to add here you should have done that instead of posting a vague insult without any supporting information or theory.  




 Right. /s 




 None of what you just said makes any sense, let alone could any of it be considered a valid argument for or against anything. Your ideas are bad and you should feel bad.  




 You should read about the actions and systems of the Third Reich beginning with their rise to power in 1933. Of course the holocaust was the peak of their depravity, but their motives and tactics from the beginning weren't as far from those employed by US police forces as you might think.  




 Hold on, now. Being kind to animals doesn't necessarily make a person fair or humane. Hitler was a vegetarian and an animal advocate who enacted animal cruelty laws. 

Yes, what he did here was absolutely commendable, but this guy could still be a total shithead. 

Edit: added paragraph break.  




 I'm assuming that you meant to type "basic Christian doctrine"? And yes, it's fucked up reasoning that can be used to rationalize literally anything and everything.  




 Or the ever-applicable explanation that it was all "god's will". Which means that god does exist, but he's a heartless monster that cares no more for innocents than he cares for murderers.  




 Yuck! Same here. Those people are terrible. Though, it's scary to honestly think about how many people actually believe shit like that.  




 Is that usually a valid argument in the case of hit and run accidents? "Your honor, the other vehicle was completely destroyed. There was no reason to believe that the driver survived. My client saw no benefit in stopping to call emergency authorities." Or does this excuse only work for law enforcement?  




 You're missing the point. The purpose of a trial is to determine guilt. You cannot determine guilt without a trial. It's not up to the prosecutor to decide, it's up to the jury. You're using cyclic reasoning to argue against a trial. There is probable cause and compelling video evidence. Let a jury decide. If the killers were anyone other than law enforcement, this wouldn't even be a discussion.  




 Again, a judge has already established that they do. Why are you so hellbent on shielding these sacks from a fair trial? There's video evidence. A judge has ruled that there's probable cause for charges. Let a fucking jury decide.  




 I'm pretty sure that a decent prosecutor could make a damn good argument that this is a case of sexual assault.  




 You're actually defending this scumbag for fleeing the scene of a fatal accident, because his victim was already dead? Are there no limits to the depths that you police apologists will sink?  




 Trolls gotta troll.  




 Tell it to the jury. All you're doing is arguing for obstructing the judicial process.  




 This has nothing to do with the gold standard.  




 Facts aren't even a tool of the right. How could they possibly claim any sort of domain over them? The reason OP was showing you the door is that you obviously don't care about the facts.  




 I agree. I couldn't resist the chance to punch a hole in that argument, though. Thanks for the opportunity.  




 There is video evidence of these crimes. Let a fucking jury decide.  




 Per capita does little to affect the numbers on this topic. Undeniably, police in the US kill people at a much higher rate. Population size has nothing to do with it.  




 Thanks.  




 I imagine that some of the funding is coming from industry players who have a long term interest in seeing such programs installed elsewhere and expanded as much as possible.  




 This is terrifying. I live in a poor area of town and I've never been in trouble with the law. I've never been a violent person wnd I have an infant child. I know for a fact that the house I rent has been raided multiple times before I moved in here. I wonder if such a system would mark my residence as a "red threat" even though it's a rental property?  




 All that work, but no nothing to note an edit. Tsk, tsk.  




 This is the problem, a judge has already established that there is probable cause to bring charges and prosecute. This shouldn't be prosecuted or not at the discretion of a biased partisan. The prosecutor obviously has a conflict of interests that the police officers involved and their departments are closely associated with the office of the DA and their prosecutors. There needs to be an independent prosecutor that has no connections with the criminal justice system, who charges and tries cases of police misconduct. As long as normal prosecutors continue to fulfill this duty, we can never expect justice in these cases.  




 I do. Probable cause is what's necessary for charges and a trial. Proof beyond a reasonable doubt is what's necessary for a conviction. 

You've been arguing that there isn't a legal basis for charges in the first place. That's an outright lie. There's probable cause for all of those charges. One of the main reasons we can't expect a conviction, is because people like you would prefer there be no trial to begin with.  




 And there's no bias here. I haven't stated any preference to charges, just an opinion that there are no charges that I forsee sticking in this case.


That's funny because Judge Ronald Adrine found probable cause for the charges of murder, involuntary manslaughter, reckless homicide, negligent homicide, and dereliction of duty. But what would he know? He's only a judge. You're not biased at all are you?  
























 Isn't that what we did?  




 A very similar thing happened with my 3 month old cousin, only that lady didn't have to stop caring for children. My aunt lobbied our state legislature and got a law passed to allow a judge to prohibit an unlicensed childcare worker from working with children while under investigation for certain criminal acts.  




 What you just said won't be true until all of those groups and distinctions are protected under federal law. Everything you just listed is protected except sexual orientation and identity.  




 Yeah it's really disappointing that Republicans keep blocking this legislation that really should have been passed decades ago.  




 That's a trend that started just before the Civil War when the south argued that a state didn't have the right to refuse to enforce a federal law they didn't agree with (the fugitive slave acts), that the people of a state didn't have the right to prohibit slavery (because slavery should be an "inalienable right"), and again after the war when trying to whitewash what they'd done ("the Civil War was about states rights"). Kinda shows how far we've come. Up to that point the assholes always won.  




 You should have said wealthier parents with more and better connections.  




 They shouldn't. But then again, neither should rhinoceros horn.  




 Oh, is that all? So, soon you'll just need a conceal carry permit to be an armed teacher in the state of Kansas? 




 This is the back door entrance for the religious and ideological nut jobs who want to take over school curriculum. 




 Thanks anyway.  




 Foreign policy is primarily the responsibility of the executive branch. He's the head of state.  




 Got anything that doesn't come from an well known right-wing propaganda outlet?  




 That's what I was thinking. It could lead to peace and not war so therefore it's bad. How are the warhawks gonna drop their payloads if everyone keeps talking about diplomacy and peace?  




 Shhh, that doesn't fit the narrative that low wage workers are the biggest drain on our economy. Stop talking sense, man.  




 Yeah, when there's nothing to be angry about they make shit up.  




 What's bad about it?  




 I think I understand where you're coming from and some people on bikes can certainly be jerks, but I don't think it's difficult to be cautious around bicyclists.  




 I'm not pretending to make a positive identification, but [considering that it could possibly be this] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_bark_scorpion) I would at least take it seriously and avoid interacting with them.  




 Considering the current political state throughout most of the world, yes they'd have to be evil.  




 My state, Missouri has plenty of sprawl and shitty drivers as well. If people want to bike they have every right to do so. It's a shitty attitude that hates on someone for being self-propelled.  




 No, they're not. Their status is [vulnerable] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale_shark), not endangered.  




 That's terrible.  




 Yeah, there was some horrible shit that happened to that species, but there are* over 500,000 alive today.  




 No, it's only effective at infecting people when it enters the nasal passageways and sinuses. The digestive tract can almost always take care of it.  




 Is that supposed to be an argument? Did you realize that you were wrong and that's why you've resorted to senseless, ineffective personal insults?  




 Too bad it's from the Daily Mail.  




 Heh, this reminds me of all those years in which everyone blamed the president for high gas prices.  




 A lot of people feel that way.  




 Leave me alone.  




 Nice. Edited your comment to fit your argument. Please leave me alone now.  




 I never argued against GMOs. What was it you were saying about reading?  




 I should have looked at your history before replying to you. Have a nice night, child.  




 Seems like this is a spam account.  




 Bicycling can be a hobby, but first and foremost it's a mode of transportation. Bicyclists have a right to use the roadways and deserve the same respect and consideration as any other travelers, ya prick.  




 Yes this. He didn't even have cigarettes on him at the time.  




 Right. It was never dropped on human beings? It's not still contaminating the soil in those areas to this day is it? What do you think happens when you drop a potent toxin from airplanes? Smart ass. 

 




 It's evil when it's known to be terribly toxic, persistent, and the company knowingly produces it to be used and/or tested on human beings.  




 Yeah lol. Tell that to these [folks] (http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/suit-filed-over-government-test-spraying-in-st-louis-during/article_9bc1fc7d-7093-58a3-b557-0cbac5dc38ab.html) and the countless people affected by [this] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_Orange). I'm sure you'll find all of that to be hilarious.  




 Every one of you guys thinks of yourself as a hero. If you need a source, go back to your sub and observe the egos and total lack of empathy for the people you hurt and the damage you cause.  




 It does, doesn't it?  




 I don't need any of that. I can be pissed off at Monsanto for the evil chemicals they've produced and helped the military use on people. No I'm not talking about conspiracy theories, I'm talking about facts that are a matter of public record.  




 Is that for real?

Edit: Thanks for the gold! 




 No it doesn't. If someone says that people with qualities a, b, c, and d are not considered to be x, it does not automatically follow that everyone without qualities a, b, c, and d should be considered to be x. That's faulty logic.  




 But they're not doing any of that. They're removing dissenting opinions or criticisms.  




 Oh, but they are. As well as their fellow cops, the media, and people across the country. Every time a cop shoots someone it's always the same excuse. "I feared for my life". Not only do other officers and police departments buy that shit, but they're offended when someone questions it.  




 I am not a public employee. I have the right to express whatever opinion I like. The police cannot silence me simply because they disagree.  




 Okay. But we're still not talking about public employees.  




 The killers of Tamir Rice, Aiyana Stanley-Jones, James Boyd, John Greer, Walter Scott, Freddie Gray, and so many others. Everyone who claims that the police are hero rather than just people doing their jobs or in these cases monsters committing crimes against the American people.  




 No one is stopping you from saying anything. You just can't link directly to the piggy-wiggy sub. That's not censorship.  




 That's public employees. Private citizens on their private time don't have restrictions on their speech. The government cannot abridge their speech.  




 While you're not wrong about there not being a binding legal precedent, a cursory Google search will show that quite a few police departments have deleted their comments section or Facebook page when confronted with this problem. The police are not known for backing down when questioned.  




 A hero doesn't shoot unarmed people. A hero doesn't shoot children. A hero doesn't torture someone to death. A hero doesn't need all of his buddies to cover up his actions and defend him in public.  




 All of the PD Facebook pages I've seen are filled with praise and adulation for police officers and the department. If they're going to have a forum that allows those kinds of posts then they need to allow people to complain or speak out against that with which they disagree.  




 https://www.reddit.com/r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut/comments/3d4dc2/my_local_police_must_be_responding_to_a_pancake/ 




 I can't imagine being in a position in life where I would find it necessary to demonize those who have less than me. People who hate on the poor and needy have their priorities all fucked up. 

Edit:Changed a word.  









 A human body is larger than an inch or so in diameter. Do you know how they ultimately remove concrete in cases like this? Jackhammer and sledgehammers.  









 With so much disparity between the numbers of each population, that's just not possible.  




 I broke the metacarpal above my pinky and I had no idea. I was walking around like that for a couple of days before someone convinced me to go to the hospital.  




 On what grounds should there be leeway? What part of freedom of expression are you having difficulty with? The leeway that PDs have is to choose to not have a comments section. It's a public forum. If they're going to allow one type of speech they have to allow all of it.  




 Maybe you're right. It's still generally accepted that government Facebook pages are public forums and the removal of dissenting comments constitutes a violation of free speech. Those pages do not belong to private individuals, and while they may ultimately belong to Facebook, that company is not conducting the censorship. Public employees are selectively deleting opinions with which they disagree.  




 But isn't that the point? Trump can say all of the awful stuff that hateful Republicans are thinking and Bush can just remain quiet and look moderate in comparison.  




 Don't forget slavery and Jim Crowe!  




 I'm pretty sure that you're allowed to stone her to death if she's not.  




 It's happening! Muwahahahahaaaaa! 




 Something tells me that was purposeful.  




 I can think of a really good reason for advertisers to avoid the LA Times.  




 And why doesn't the bank have to pay taxes on the land their basically sitting on waiting for a profit?  




 http://www.hawaiifreepress.com/ArticlesMain/tabid/56/ID/12959/HPD-Ordered-to-Pay-31K-over-Censored-Facebook-Comments.aspx

There was another in San Diego that was settled for like $20 and resulted in the police deleting their entire Facebook page.  




 If they're censoring comments that they disagree with then they're going to have a bad time. It's already been ruled that government Facebook pages are a public forum and deleting comments violates the first amendment.  




 There is definitely a race problem in the US, and it's definitely present in our police misconduct/brutality problems, but really the police victimize everyone regardless of race. A closer look would reveal that this is deep down a class problem and unfortunately there are many communities where the majority of black folks are at the lowest level of income.  




 I believe that the position of police officer should require a professional license and professional liability insurance. Then if an officer fucks up their insurance has to pay. Lawless cops would soon find themselves uninsurable and therefore out of a job. If the public chooses to not do anything about this problem then they do, in fact, reap what they sow. Fix the system or learn to cope. Take from that what you want. 




 Now do you have a source on that? Here's an actual documented Lyndon Johnson quote:

"If you can convince the lowest white man he's better than the best colored man, he won't notice you're picking his pocket. Hell, give him somebody to look down on, and he'll empty his pockets for you." ~ 




 I think so too. It, would put an end to this speculation, it wouldn't destroy the parking lot, and it would minimally disturb any evidence that might be discovered. A lot of people want to know what's down there and dammit those girls deserve justice.  




 I feel like there are going be some big bumps on the road ahead for Reddit. Along the way, there are some very aggressive implied promises being made to the community  in comments to mods, quotes from board members and theyre going have some pretty big challenges in meeting those implied promises.

I'd say. They just lost their head engineer.  




 This shouldn't be surprising. There aren't nearly as* many politicians and corrupt wealthy people as there are normal citizens relatively speaking. This information is misleading, really. A politician who works for the public should not be able to wipe away history. They're public employees and what they do affects everyone else.  




 I've seen an officer on Cold Case Files take a pole with him into a forest and push it into the soil where he thought there were remains. When he found them the odor was obvious and he then knew where to dig. 

I'm not sure how common this practice is, but it's certainly better than not looking at all. It wouldn't necessarily be that disruptive to the scene.  




 That's not necessarily true. Search teams often use this method for finding remains in the forest. The hole only has to be an inch of two in diameter.  




 And the taxpayers should continue to pay until they do something about it.  




 The problems with the Catholic Church come from the fact that the organization did nothing to stop abusers and they require celibacy from their priests.  




 Couldn't they make bore holes in the areas in question? If it's nothing, fill it in and be done with it.  




 I agree.  




 Yeah, this is a terrible case of abuse.  




 Mathew 25: 46 Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life.

Is that not hell? Eternal punishment? 

You too have a nice night.  




 [No true Scotsman eh?] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman). True Christians don't believe in hell because you don't believe in hell.  




 I'm done talking to you as you have nothing to say.  




 What are you even talking about? This article is about exactly what I'm talking about. Treating people fairly and not excluding their for their private lives.  




 The majority of Christians don't believe in hell as an actual place? That's bullshit. I live right smack dab in the middle of Christian America and I can assure you that you're wrong. Every one of these people believe I'm going to burn in hell for eternity and they feel intense Schadenfreude at the mere idea. 

No I quoted two* different parts. The big Mathew part was comprised of consecutive passages, granted the formatting sucked, but it was one part of the scripture. I don't think it's morally sound to turn your back on family because they don't believe the same things you do. The last part about losing one's life for Christ and achieving eternal life sounds an awful lot like the martyrs of islam.  




 I don't know. Maybe their partner drove them to a meeting? A neighbor kjew they cohabitated and gossip travelled. People shouldn't be expected to hide who they are in order to be accepted unless they're actually doing something wrong. Being LGBT isn't wrong.  




 They were expelled from the group for being homosexual. This isn't a non-issue. When the organization found out about their sexual orientation, they kicked them out.  




 22 Indeed I will cast her (Jezebel) into a sickbed, and those who commit adultery with her into great tribulation, unless they repent of their deeds.
23 I will kill her children with death, and all the churches shall know that I am He who searches the minds and hearts. And I will give to each one of you according to your works.

Matthew 10:32-39New International Version (NIV)

32Whoever acknowledges me before others,I will also acknowledge before my Father in heaven.33But whoever disowns me before others, I will disown before my Father in heaven.

34Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.35For I have come to turn

a man against his father,
a daughter against her mother,
a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law
36a mans enemies will be the members of his own household.[a]

37Anyone who loves their father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; anyone who loves their son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.38Whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me.39Whoever finds their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life for my sake will find it.


Let's not forget that all things are forgiven in Christ. So by your beliefs, Jeffrey Dahmer is in the kingdom of God looking down on us right now. As well as any child molester, genocidal maniac, murderer, cannibal, war lord, or any other monster who repents before death. But a Hindu boy who died of cancer at the age of eight is burning in the eternal fire. 

 




 You're right we did have a war over the institution of slavery 150 years ago. Those on both sides cited the bible as their justification. And in those actions they were both absolutely correct. The bible justifies and supports slavery. There are also parts of the bible that instruct followers to treat each other and even nonbelievers with fairness and decency. 

In the time since, the god of Abraham has proceeded to kill off as many as 50% of human pregnancies in their first trimesters. Literally tens of billions of spontaneous abortions. It shouldn't be surprising though, as the bible came with its own set of instructions on how to perform a holy abortion. So gather the kids and open your bible to the book of Numbers chapter 5. It's holy scripture and the word of God, so it has to be good.  




 Forgive me, but what you're describing is like picking corn kernels out of shit because "it's really good corn". The new testament and even the teachings of Christ have blatantly immoral teachings and examples.  




 That doesn't make it any more moral. Thats called a rationalization. If you're killing someone in order to neutralize an immediate threat and to protect innocents, then that's obviously morally sound. If you're murdering someone after the fact in order to effect retribution, that's a rationalization.  




 The user in that link admitted it wasn't his photo. OP claimed he took it and even had some back story about how he had to do it quickly because he didn't want to start any trouble.  




 It's not, but historically the individual chapters are often operated by Christians and Christian organizations. They do require a belief in god or a higher power.  




 Okay I'll give you a few examples. Spring break, Mardi Gras, literally every other movie and TV show in the last fifty or sixty years, until recently the institution of marriage, sporting events, wet t-shirt contests I don't think I need to continue. You're complaining about a few parades that you're absolutely not required to attend. 

No one is interested in being overtly sexual in the Boy Scouts. They simply didn't want to be excluded from the group because of who they are. It's a reasonable request.  




 I'm going to give you another chance. You're intelligent enough to use reddit and type so I'm sure you can think of a few.  




 I don't know. I think we can all agree that murder is immoral. I think we can all agree that slavery is immoral. I'm pretty sure that we all disagree with child rape. Do I really need to go on?  




 What? So by demanding equal rights LGBT people are flaunting their sexuality? Or did you see or hear about something gay that you didn't like, so now you have concluded that all gay people are pushing their sexuality on you? Did it ever occur to you that on any given population there is going to be a spectrum of different personalities, tastes, perspectives, and politics? Do you really have to think that hard to come up with a several examples of heterosexual people openly flaunting their sexuality?  




 I never said that I had the final say. I said that Christianity does not. It's not even close. And yes the bible is filled from end to end with immorality from both god and man, all declared divine and just.  




 It's disappointing that you despise people who simply want to be treated equally and fairly. You need to take a long hard look at yourself pal.  




 I don't disagree with most of what you said but I'd like to point out that while there may be decent little pockets in the new testament, there is plenty that is despicable and wholly immoral. I still stand by my assertion that the bible is a terrible source for morality.  




 All human beings want to live and wish to avoid death so it is immoral to murder them.  




 Not all morality is subjective. There are universal truths to the human experience. People choosing to ignore them doesn't make them any less true.  




 Probably. Or maybe someone who deserves it could end up in the Hudson.  




 Huh? So some of them have different taste than you and that makes them filthy and immoral?  




 I don't disagree. That has little to do with morality and more to do with Christianity and tradition.  




 I meant the United States since that's where I am and that's where the BSA is located.  




 What has stopped this from happening in the past? You don't have a valid argument here.  




 Well to be honest, after looking at it again, I was kind of opposing the idea that moral guidance need exclude LGBT people or nonbelievers. Maybe you weren't saying that it has to be that way, but you did seem to say that this was an unimportant part of the program. There are some moral guidelines that are universal to our society. Do not lie, cheat, steal. Do not kill. Share whenever possible. Treat others fairly. There's no reason that these things can't be taught without demonizing people because they're different.  




 It might if it bankrupts a department or two. It's possible that some jackass might get off his ass and do his job rather than his cronies and superiors losing their jobs. No one wants to end up in the Hudson.  




 I don't think you did. I was adding rather than arguing. Sorry. Maybe I'm a little wound up. Some of these comments in here are just plain old hateful.  




 I dunno. Maybe it's in the NYPD faq.  




 What's intrinsically good about a homophobe? What's intrinsically bad about LGBT people? Where do you get your ideas of morality? Why do you expect and demand all other Americans to be the same as you?  




 There's no "turning" here. LGBT people have been marginalized, demonized, and ostracized for as long as we have been a country. Demanding equal rights and treatment isn't an attack on anyone. It's an affirmation of their humanity.  




 Homophobes tend to be outspoken. I thought it was obvious that OP wasn't just talking about people who silently disagree.  




 But LGBT people aren't automatically immoral just by being who they are. Christianity doesn't have the final say on morality, and honestly the bible is a terrible source for morality.  




 I think you just wanted people to read a story about you pooping.  




 I see nothing wrong with a 40 year old father being involved with a girl scout troop. Correct me if I'm wrong but troop activities are almost always supervised by multiple adults who are usually parents. What difference does gender or sexual orientation make? Homosexuals aren't any more likely to abuse children than heterosexuals. You understand that men aren't all pedophiles right?  




 I remember them mostly being **a lot** of rain and wind. The article describes this one as being about as strong as a level 2 or 3 hurricane so just watch the news and avoid going outside when the news advises against it. They have bilingual news in a lot of places over there. 




 The grand conspiracy to poo poo on the pudding man! 




 [The female mostly eats the male during mating when they're in captivity.] (http://www.snopes.com/critters/wild/mantis1.asp)  




 I don't know about that. I don't hear a lot of love for him from conservatives.  




 What the hell was on the jar?  




 Or, it could be because he's a rapist.  




 They could have at least employed an undercover police officer who was wired and armed.  




 Hate isn't a value in a healthy society.  




 I have a kid and I agree with OP. Homosexuals aren't child predators. They're just normal people and should be treated as such. 

Edit: typo  









 I can't wait to hear all of the bitching and moaning about this one. They're going to have to get pretty creative to find a reason to be offended by this.  




 I'm sorry about the PMs. That's uncalled for. I disagree with people and sometimes used some very heated rhetoric, but I don't PM other users or brigade. If they keep it up, report them to the mods and admins. It seems like /r/BCND mods are at the very least interested in preserving this sub and they understand that subs are removed when their users blatantly break the rules. Good luck.  




 Same here. Sorry again for unloading on you.  




 Cars are transportation vehicles. They aren't designed for the sole purpose of killing people. Insurance companies do not call them "accidents". They're called collisions and someone is always held responsible. It's not a good analogy.  




 Oh, yeah. Thanks for turning me around. All I have to do is buy into Trump's disturbed narrative and I can hate too.  




 A lot of that depends on how their trial(s) are conducted. They're obviously guilty of some serious offenses. I personally feel that second degree murder is appropriate. I think all of them should be charged with at least something. 

People see that video and they can't believe it, because it's so terrible. If we're going to have any faith in the system at all, then the men who committed those crimes need to be held accountable. This wasn't simply a case of a lack of training or a field mistake. This was actual malice.  




 What? Arrested and threatened with five years incarceration for an internationally acclaimed artist hanging a few posters in that rancid shithole of a city? Detroit and their fucked up police need to change. Their priorities are all fucked up.  




 I agree that more training is absolutely necessary. I don't want to see any more mentally ill people or police officers harmed. It's an obvious problem and blame is squarely on politicians and officials for not addressing it. 

But the James Boyd case is something different entirely. They used their firearms and shot him, then they used their less lethal stuff and dog to torture him as he lay dying. What those guys did is unforgivable.  




 If the suspect is known to be armed and dangerous then the officer is obviously going to draw his weapon and order the suspect's hands in the air. If the suspect doesn't follow orders, it's not unreasonable that the officer would fear for his life. That's very different than an unarmed man. We're talking about two different things here.  




 There's no such thing as an accidental discharge. A weapon doesn't fire itself. The person holding it is responsible for what it does.  




 Oh, really? And how do you figure? How about instead, we stop attacking countries and killing innocent civilians that aren't threatening us?  
























 Didn't Karl Pilkington find one of those in the wild during his climb of Mt Fuji?  




 So that one was actually malicious, but this one is just simple dipshitery.  




 [Lol, like this?] (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1034314/)  




 I don't think that incompetence suggests malice.  




 Some fully formed organs. Not all of them are fully formed. Especially not the brain which is what we consider to be the most human of them all.  




 This comes across as incompetence to me.  




 So in other words the governor doesn't understand how the process works and no one in his office explained it to him.  




 Okay. So you're not a creationist. No one really cares about this sort of stuff. That's your personal belief and it doesn't affect anything or anyone else. When you start trying to substitute actual* science with those beliefs is when we have a problem.  




 How is standing for rule of law "anti-cop"?  




 You might remember Baptist as the denomination of Christianity that prides itself in not aggressively proselytizing at every possible opportunity.

What?  




 You're allowed to believe whatever you want. Just understand that it's in no way science and has no place in a discussion about science.  




 Are you trying to say that /r/coontown and other subs like it need exposure in order to exist because that's not really true. Most of these controversial subs get most of their traffic through word of mouth. If users don't log in they can't vote, post, or comment so who cares about them. People who opt out of seeing this side of reddit will miss out on a lot more than just a few hateful subs. Most people will want to see at least some of that content so this isn't going to exclude enough people to directly kill any of those communities. 

This wouldn't necessarily hurt any subs, but it will allow reddit to isolate that content and sell ad space for better or worse.  




 Because their unions lobby against decriminalization and legalization, and to increase criminal penalties so that their industry will continue to grow.  




 Yep. I agree wholeheartedly.  




 He was born again and very religious before he died. Christ forgives all sins. That would have to include drilling a hole in a teenage boys head and filling it with acid in an attempt to create a mindless sex slave. Go figure.  














 *Incarcerated

So basically the NYPD is just arresting people for no good reason. This is sickening. Almost every employee in a job that requires manual labor benefits from having a simple lock blade on their belt.  




 Of course he felt threatened. There was a defiant suspect in his presence. It didn't matter that she was a tiny teenage girl in handcuffs. He was fearful for his safety. She could have said something to really hurt his feelings. Teenage girls can be really mean. Especially when they've been drinking.  





























 Oh, my bad. I didn't realize that it was wrong to expect people to behave with any sort of integrity or honesty.  




 Ahh. Well, it was still appropriate so, no harm no foul.  




 And your male teenagers.  




 Anti fracking? How is that antiscience? You'd have to be an idiot to support a company whose operations are causing cluster cancer, earthquakes, contaminated drinking water, and flooding your streets with toxic waste. Opposing this shit is antiscience? That's rich. So now anything that opposes the operations and therefore profits of major corporations is antiscience? That's a very special perspective you have.  




 The creationist argument is the definition of idiotic and ignorant denial of science.  




 What are you trying to say? That Republicans are more likely to accept the scientific concensus that Democratic voters? If you're talking about the antivaccination movement you should do a bit of research. Those assholes are split very evenly across political ideologies with a slight increase as a person becomes more conservative.  




 What do you want me to do, go through every state's legal definition until I find one that doesn't define corrections officers as law enforcement so you can be right? Literally every source and authority I've looked at defines corrections officers as law enforcement. You're in the minority. No one else is arguing your case. Just give it up already.  




 I think a better argument would be that profit is not automatically and always a good thing.  




 The thing is iirc, he invited a bunch of these people to the award ceremony.  




 Apparently, on top of being in exact opposition of everyone else on this topic, you have a reading comprehension problem.  




 You're right. But I'm surrounded by Christians and they believe that Jeffrey Dahmer is in heaven right now.  




 This is probably why they don't travel abroad.  




 What? This isn't an argument. I'm not supporting the war on drugs. I'm explaining why your post was removed.  




 That's funny. I usually look at Dahmer as an argument against religion. According to the tenets of Christianity Dahmer should be in heaven with god and Jesus right now doing whatever he wants for all of eternity. But everyone outside of Christianity will burn in eternal hell fire. That's a lot of good, decent people suffering forever.  




 From the wiki:

During this period, Robinson cultivated and maintained the outward appearance of a community-minded citizen and family man; he became a Scoutmaster, a baseball coach and a Sunday school teacher. In 1977 he talked his way onto the board of directors of a localcharitable organizationand forged a series of letters from its executive director to the mayor of Kansas City, and from the mayor to other civic leaders, commending his generous volunteer efforts and generally singing his praises. Eventually he had himself named the organization's Man of the Year, and threw a festive awards luncheon in his own honor.

He was an* accomplished fraud.  




 There's also the fact that one study doesn't "prove" anything. It's completely possible that another study could have entirely different results.  




 I disagree. I think it's obvious that religious freedom for Christians means that only Christians should be free to practice their religion.  




 Pretty obvious sock puppet.

 "I hate them for who they love so they should be marginalized and discriminated against."  




 That's garbage. Posting an article in this sub does not equal a complete endorsement or agreement of its contents. 

I never said they should be disbarred. You can create whatever narrative you like, but it won't change anything.  




 Well, they're certainly not supporting religious freedom. They're pushing their own special brand of McMorality.  




 The courts have ruled that civil servants do not have the same rights as normal citizens during the performance of their duties and sometimes even during their personal time. Whether you agree with this or not is irrelevant. 

I didn't say that they should be disbarred. I suggested that there were possibly ethics violations that should be investigated. But, on reddit you're not allowed to be wrong without hordes upon hordes descending upon you to call you names and tell you that you're wrong.  




 I'm warning you, this thread is not going to be friendly to your opinion.  




 This is terrible. What kind of scumbag would listen to scientologists regarding mental heath issues.  




 No they're not. They're just assholes.  




 Yeah. That's right. Are you okay?  




 Please don't tell me what to do.  




 And how were the movements OWS/Ferguson/Baltimore illegal. And don't tell me that the movements were illegal because of a few bad actors because that's bullshit.  




 Oh they can. They'll just be fired. Civil disobedience is not a protected right. I don't know why you would think that it was.  




 Well you joke, but this amounts to more than just inconvenience. We used to have multiple arts and crafts stores here. They were family owned businesses. I was actually close with the family that owned the Ben Franklin. Things did not work out well for them.  




 Yeah. I remember those days just a couple of years ago. People were so free. Insurers were* free to deny children coverage because of existing conditions. Insurers were free to wait for a premium holder to file a large claim and then dropped them for something as simple as failing to report every childhood cavity or acne. You're right. Freedom is great isn't it? /s 




 Whether or not it's legal, it's certainly a dick move and it basically means that I and other artists and crafters in my area must drive two hours away or order everything online.  




 That's what I thought too, but the attorney in this thread said that oath is unenforceable.  




 With the new executive order that's not necessary anymore.  




 Thank you /u/in_yo_mouth for having the strength and courage to make everyone's contraceptive decisions for them. Next will you decide which shitty school we're allowed to send our kids to once a condom breaks?  




 Not to mention that they basically put all other arts and crafts stores out of business while simultaneously carrying a majority of hokey Christian related products and refusing to carry anything that might be from other religions or philosophies. Talk about freedom! 




 This is just poetically hypocritical.  




 Absolutely. But the executive order should sufficiently remove the employer from the equation.  




 I think you answered your own question.  




 You're right. The Supreme Court allowed employers to opt out, the executive signed an order allowing third party insurance to pay for it. Now employees can get the medicine they need and employers can butt-out. 

Edit: added a comma.  




 Did you even read the fucking article?  




 It's been explained to me that there's no precedent for disbarring either of these politicians. But if they were investigated it would be for violating the ethical guidelines defined by their respective licensing bodies, not for their political offices.  




 Apparently. Please go away.  




 My point is that the oath is unenforceable. But I don't care either way. I'm not arguing for impeachment. Why don't you bring your argument to /u/firstamendanon? He/she is a lawyer and can answer your questions. 

In the meanwhile, please refrain from insulting me personally.  




 An attorney takes the same oath that a politician takes in regards to upholding the law and the constitution. The lawyer in this thread said it's unenforceable.  




 Am I a criminal if I leave my car parked by the meter for too long?  




 Disobeying federal cannabis laws.  




 Right. But they do it all of the damn time. It recently came out that Rick Perry is on the payroll of the biggest donor to his superpac. Unless they were literally standing in front of a camera, how do you prove coordination or collusion? It's unenforceable garbage.  




 What the hell are you talking about?  




 Elected officials have a right to free expression. By your logic, nearly every elected official in Colorado should be impeached.  




 Luckily he'll never get the chance to do anything to the country.  




 You're right. I've become far more liberal in the last 15 years.  




 Correct.  




 You can at least stabilize the head, apply a compress, and proceed to rush the victim to an emergency department. But I guess if you are a police officer who shot someone, you want to be certain that they will die, so you do nothing.  




 I agree. This could very well solve a lot of the problems we're having with the police in this country.  




 A cop confiscating your camera and arresting you is not a passive act.  




 The sheriff said he was not happy to have to continue paying Bagnall a salary that he estimated to be in the high 40s until the case was resolved.

Theres a victim in this case ... and sometimes the system stinks, Bartlett said.

Were very proud of the job we do here, and this is not something we take lightly, The sheriff added. I was extremely disappointed in his actions, and he will never again set foot in this building, unless he goes to jail.

Good on the sheriff for turning this dirt bag out on his ass. Hopefully he'll do some real time for this. 

 




 Well, it would need to be more organized than that. Someone would have to write some legislation so it can be presented at the state or federal level.  




 You don't arrest criminals. The police are far too cowardly for that. You pick on kids and vulnerable people for smoking pot or being black. You take kick backs from or just steer clear of actual criminals.  




 I wonder where those god awful pigs from PnS are on this one? I wonder why they're not here to explain "how we don't know the whole story yet" or some shit like that.  




 Is that what you call it when the professional board that issued your license questions your ethics?  




 Omg, they actually cited that user even though he admitted that he was lying when he said he took that photo. What a bunch of assholes.  




 Holy shit. So aside from beating and killing innocent people the police are also ignoring and humiliating the victims of violent crimes? We don't need them.  









 You may be right about segregation being the basis of most Jim Crow laws, but understand that you're arguing that Ted Cruz is not unlike those tortured souls who fought for equal rights and treatment while he, in fact, argues against the equal rights and treatment of another group. And it's still true that there was much about the Jim Crow south that can not be explained by "separate but equal".

 My favorite part is how Forbes says he's worth more like $4.1 billion. 




 Can you read? 

Edit: I posted an article. That doesn't mean that it represents my views entirely and I didn't write the damn thing. Yesterday I posted an article that explained Santorum's position on a constitutional amendment that would ban gay marriage. I sure as hell don't agree with that man about anything.  




 First commenter, whoever you are you may be shadowbanned. You can find out at /r/shadowban.  
























 Not all of them. That only applies to segregation. Jim Crow was much worse than just segregation.  




 The livelihood? He's a publicly paid elected official. It's also worth pointing out that he's made it his personal political mission to go after families he doesn't identify or agree with. 

Edit: It's also worth noting that he supports employers having the right to deny someone a job or terminate them on the basis of their sexual orientation, and businesses having the right to deny service or products to someone on the same basis.  




 So you're saying that Bernie Sanders should be in prison for allowing cannabis to be decriminalized in his jurisdiction?  




 The public employees who refuse to obey the law and perform their duties should be terminated by their immediate supervisors or the next elected official up.  




 I wasn't advancing the argument that they should be disbarred. I asked a simple question.  




 You're probably right, but at the very least it makes them hypocrites.  




 But this article and this discussion are referring to these politicians professional legal licenses. Otherwise what would we be talking about?  




 When did Senator Sanders obtain a professional license that could be scrutinized or revoked?  




 What do you call officers of the court and elected officials instructing public employees to disobey the law and refuse to perform their duties?  




 We already pay for the utility. Just like every other public and private service. There's no reason why we should have to pay for their mistakes as well as suffer the consequences of them. 

Then the individual himself is held responsible.  




 It's not the victim's family making these claims. It's the owner of the mobile home park and therefore the surveillance cameras that caught the footage.  




 Yes he was. He was not a public employee, and he was not an American so anything he said or did is not applicable here, and I think it's more than ridiculous to compare Senator Cruz to Ghandi.  




 How is advising public employees to disobey the law and refuse to do their jobs civil disobedience? Public employees are not private citizens during the performance* of their duties. This sounds more like "professional disobedience" or in other words, "insubordination" and grounds for termination.  




 Yeah, third party is what I'm talking about. I don't know about you, but most of the people I've spoken to would prefer if taxpayers were liable in any way for the actions of these employees. It's bad enough that we have to pay for their salaries and their equipment. It's unconscionable we should have to pay when they brutalize or kill us too.  




 Don't know. I doubt it, but it would surprise me if no attorney has ever faced sanctions for endorsing lawlessness.  









 No, public employees refusing to obey the law and do their jobs is not civil disobedience. A licensed attorney and public official advising public employees to disobey the law is not civil disobedience. And even if it is, civil disobedience has never been protected by law. If you need examples of this look at all of the people brutalized during Occupy Wallstreet, the Ferguson and Baltimore protests, or any other protest in US history.  




 It would have to be paid for by the individual. Cops would have to cooperate just as nurses, doctors, contractors, truck drivers, etc.  




 So then it's just meaningless. Because murder for hire is extremely rare and overall murder rates are unaffected by capital punishment.  




 So you don't have a source. 

Because what I'm saying is that Jim Crow laws were unconstitutional and once challenged they were thrown out by the applicable courts including SCOTUS. An attorney should not be telling anyone to break the law, but they can render an opinion on whether a statute is lawful and constitutional. In this case the SCOTUS has already determined the constitutionality of same sex marriage. Senator Cruz knows the law. He's not rendering an opinion, he's advising public employees to disobey the law which is very clear.  




 He wasn't so that didn't happen. 

But, I suppose if he possessed a license to practice law and violated the bar's ethics guidelines it would need to be investigated and he would possibly face sanctions. 

Edit: grammar  




 I understand that the author of the article said disbarred, but I said investigated. 

Where those Jim Crowe laws upheld by the SCOTUS? Do you have a source that suggests they were? 

Because, from what I understand your hypothetical is the exact opposite of history. Politicians and lawyers were mostly supportive of the oppressive policies, or in other words, the exact same position as Cruz and friends. It took the Supreme Court to overturn those unconstitutional laws and the established powers were resistant to those changes.  









 A licensed attorney is supposed to maintain a certain amount of professionalism and respect for the law. Actively advising public employees to disobey the law is questionable at best, and at the least worthy of professional scrutiny.  




 Admitting you're wrong is the first step to addressing any mistake.  




 See the other conversation that started at this comment.  




 I'm talking about them breaking the ethics rules regarding their licenses. We're not just talking about disagreeing with a political policy. These men have advised the public to break the law. There's nothing immoral about LGBT marriage, but it's certainly immoral to discriminate against* and marginalize those you dislike or disagree with.  




 Yep. Nurses have the same requirements, and they don't even carry guns.  




 Good argument for them to relinquish their licenses. Thanks.  




 That'd be great. I've been pushing this idea for a while now. The only person to argue with me was a cop, but it's obvious why he'd rather the state carry the liability for his fuck ups.  




 No, they should be investigated for advising people to break the law while possessing a very specific professional license. What's the point in this type of license if it doesn't regulate certain types of behavior?  




 I would argue that some people would prefer to not be relegated to the status of second class citizen. You know that whole "separate but equal" thing?  




 Even better solution; require all officers to carry a professional license and professional liability insurance. If an individual cop fucks up he will find himself uninsurable, without a license, and therefore out of a job.  




 Or at the very least have their licenses investigated and possibly be disbarred.  




 Maybe we taxpayers should do something to ensure that the police will stop killing us.  




 And if it's never released to the public would you just believe the police narrative?  




 I'd like those assholes from PnS to explain this one.  




 A licensed attorney should not be advising people to break the law. Most likely nothing will come of it, but it is worth pointing out.  




 Believe it or not, [he actually is being charged with conspiracy and obstruction among other things.] (http://6abc.com/news/philadelphia-police-officer-charged-after-being-shot/851157/)  




 Flash grenade to the face.  




 He was killed for contempt of cop.  














 What happened to the natives is/was terrible. But I hardly think it's appropriate to compare them to a conversation about wildlife management. Killing and destroying a population of people is hardly the same thing as mismanaging a species of herd animals.  
























 Why not both?  




 I'm still waiting for my identification pony.  




 Of course not. He didn't tank his personal finances. He tanked his company [four times.] (http://thelawdictionary.org/article/how-is-donald-trump-able-to-file-for-bankruptcy-so-many-times/)  




 Senator John McCain's war record is astonishing. His aircraft was the one that inadvertently ignited the fire that burnt the USS Forrestal to the waterline. While it was in dry dock, he volunteered to serve on a squadron fighting in Vietnam. He was on his 23rd mission of that tour when he was informed that his unit was being tracked by enemy radar. He remained with his formation and dove to deliver his payload. It was during this time that he was shot down. He fractured both arms and a leg ejecting from his aircraft. He spent the next six years imprisoned as a POW. Two of which were spent in solitary confinement. He was offered release because of his father's high rank, but refused to leave without the rest of the POWs. 

Donald Trump is a pompous blowhard who has no experience with the military, veterans, or. Politics in general.  




 Conservatives don't watch The Daily Show. They can't stand the sound of people they disagree with.  




 Senator John McCain was one of the few Republican senators to support the reasonable veteran's funding legislation last year. He actually cosponsored it with Senator Sanders. Trump is a pompous blowhard who has no experience with the military, veterans, or politics in general.  




 Not by voting for conservative representatives and senators you don't. The last round of VA funding legislation that was designed to seriously address the issues within the VA and the treatment of our veterans was presented by the left, obstructed by the right, and ultimately gutted down to less than a tenth of its original amount before they would pass it.  




 Because people are stupid.  




 Source?  




 Source?  




 Yeah, that guy was a real piece of work. Representative Duckworth lost both of her legs in the service of her country and that guy had the nerve to insult her record for the sake of political expediency.  




 Next year? The guy's gone bankrupt multiple times.  




 No one with any sense has ever claimed that the US is a true democracy, so why are you arguing against that strawman?  




 Refusing to vote is essentially the same thing as voting for the GOP and corporate interests.  




 Found the Trump supporter.  




 Mathematically, as income goes down a fixed tax like a sales tax will increase as a percentage of ones income. Your ideas suck because 1) sales tax is a discretionary tax. Since rent, car payments, food and I some cases clothing are not subject to sales tax, what IS subject is the discretionary items. If we give low income earners a break on the sales tax on the big flat screen, maybe we are just paying for them to go from the 40 to the 50 incher. That should not be my responsibility.  If you want to have an honest discussion about who should pay for our governments services, I'm certain that it's not the governments role to supersize tvs.

Again, my state charges sales tax on food. People who buy cars pay sales taxes on them. Not everything in a person's home is discretionary. People need refrigerators, laundry machines, ovens, and other appliances to live and those things are taxed. You repeatedly bringing up televisions amounts to basic hateful demagoguery. You might as well be Reagan with his racist caricature of the Cadillac driving "Welfare Queen". You continue to ignore the taxes that the poor pay on food, clothing, appliances, services, utilities, and everything else that costs money. 

The idea also that the all of the non taxpayers are retirees and handicapped people is farcical since it's fully 50% of working age people. The demographics aren't even close to being in your favor. Last your ideas suck because every outside source you cited supported my viewpoint - the nominal tax rates, the bogus nytimes stat and the last citing that confirmed half pay nothing.

Those 50% that you're talking about don't even earn enough to feed themselves and their families. I've repeated this in every reply since you first mentioned them. This thread is a discussion about allowing them to earn an income that sustains life, and here you are complaining and alluding to them being lazy moochers. What good would it be to tax people who aren't able to cover their basic food and shelter requirements? Are they going to be more productive workers and* students when they're homeless and starving? How would that serve society? 


 




 He'll just have to make a bigger ass of himself, if that's even possible.  




 There's so much that's wrong with your statement that I don't even know where to start. 

First Senator McCain wasn't a soldier. He was a Navy sailor and a pilot. His capture wasn't the result of incompetence, but of valor and commitment to his mission. It's always a good idea to do a little research about the topic at hand to avoid making ridiculous claims that result in you looking like an obtuse blowhard.  




 I am a liberal Navy veteran. McCain's service record is a matter of national history. His aircraft was the one that accidentally ignited the USS Forrestal. He escaped death many many times.  




 But all Trump supporters, Republican or otherwise, are idiots.  




 Both are equally worthless reactions. I imagine that this and any other news source would be fine with either reaction. Fuck any news source that publishes big photos of the aggressor and doesn't focus on the victims.  




 When a low income earner buys anything the sales tax affects them. Considering that a family earning the American median income would likely spend most or all of their income on basic living expenses and most of those expenditures would be taxed, it's disingenuous to have a discussion about marginal taxation without discussing these things. Ignoring these things doesn't make them go away. 

"Your ideas suck." You can't objectively attack my ideas so you have to resort to base insults. I think I've adequately proved my point. Have a nice weekend.  




 You're not wrong, but that doesn't mean that amount of distance doesn't present a significant problem for tens of millions of low income Americans everyday.  




 I don't care what you do or think. I was simply pointing out the flaw in the logic of* your assertion that gun ownership is the root cause of police violence in the US.  




 I'm not defending the police, i'm being realistic and explaining reasoning behind their actions. Just because they are wrong doesn't mean there is no reason behind their fear.

No, there's not. If they obeyed the law (the constitution), they would have little to fear as they would not often find themselves in terrible situations where they are and must be the oppressors. 

 Canada also has guns, but only 1/3 ownership, and comparably lower shootings by police and otherwise. Things aren't perfect in Canada either though.

And just what do you think the rate of gun ownership is in the US? Because the [data shows] (http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/07/15/the-demographics-and-politics-of-gun-owning-households/) that it's roughly ~~the same as that of Canada~~ a third. 

If only police would police eachother more often.

This isn't just an issue of the police policing each other. This is about the criminal justice system ignoring the very clear text of the constitution and the simple and basic rights that it provides for the American people. 

 




 That's because most decent people believe in at least the concept of justice and wouldn't be comfortable with the possibility of executing innocent people. The question is, why would you be comfortable with the possibility of executing innocents?  




 Something like 90%.  




 It is when you live in an area which they've been known to operate in the past. I live in a town of less than 40,000 people and we have had a resident serial killer and there have been plenty of other murderers and predators that have popped up from time to time.  




 We've always had guns in this country. We're not alone in gun ownership. Canada allows gun ownership. 

Americans possessing guns is not an excuse for the police to act like belligerent brutes. A majority of their crimes would simply disappear if they were required to honor the inalienable rights enumerated in the constitution.  




 You're having a difficult time following linear thought aren't you? That 10% to 15% can be added to as much as 12% for sales taxes depending upon the locality of the tax filer. 

I just explained that group that supposedly pays nothing in [federal income taxes] (http://money.howstuffworks.com/only-53-percent-pay-income-tax.htm). They're the retired, the disabled, and those who are earning well below the poverty level. Instead of complaining about these people, perhaps we should be figuring out how we can help them to escape the crippling paralysis of poverty.  




 How can that be true when half pay zero percent of their income in federal income taxes. 

What? The median American household income is $50,000. Their effective tax rate is between 10% and 15%, not zero. The people you're talking about* paying nothing are retirees, the disabled, and severely impoverished families earning less than basic sustenance levels. If you take issue with not taxing them then that's for a different discussion and it would be about basic decency and morality, not the tax code. 


 




 That's ridiculous.  




 We're not talking about retirees or the disabled. We're talking about working American families. They're paying as much or more as a peroof their annual income than the wealthy. 

Some states exclude food or all? My state doesn't. What state excludes clothing from sales taxes? 
 




 Yeah, and as you can see from his other comment that is what he's arguing. He must not have read anything else about Grning who has admitted to having knowledge of the worst operations of the camp.  




 Sales tax doesn't just affect purchases like electronics. You're ignoring that a family earning the American median household income is likely spending most or all of their income on basic living expenses. Much of which will be affected by sales taxes. Considering that, a family earning at that level is paying around 21%

What are you talking about? Capital gains taxes are even lower than payroll taxes. For instance the Romneys paid 14.1% of their $13.7 million income into taxes last year. Add the sales tax and they might have broken 15%.  




 Yeah, that's rich. Those poor occupying soldiers. They were just there to subjugate a people. It was unfair to target them because of their organization's well established evil agenda.  




 Of course it is. Who's arguing against that point?  




 Here's another gem:

It's not about forgetting anything. It's taking into account that he ISN'T responsible, and that he allegedly had no knowledge of what was happening behind the scenes just as many in the Wehrmacht didn't. They were forced to defend their homeland, he was trying to do it in the most harmless way possible to prevent his own execution of treason. That's what you don't get. You have one mindset that he has absolutely no compassion for the camp's victims and actions. He's a frail old man going to prison. Learn to forgive and forget. Vengeance is a dirty move. 



I knew that shit was coming. What a dipshit. 

 




 It's not about forgetting anything.  It's taking into account that he ISN'T responsible, and that he allegedly had no knowledge of what was happening behind the scenes just as many in the Wehrmacht didn't.  

Read his wiki article. He knew damn well what was happening and has admitted it. He personally observed the operations of the gas chambers and the burn pits. 

The Wermacht were not just innocent soldiers. They were complicit in countless atrocities including rounding up "undesirables" for the camps, razing villages and raping and murdering civilians, and destroying German infrastructure in order to prevent the* allies from being able to utilize it. All of which have been well documented. Your's is a revisionist, apologist's history. 

He's a frail old man going to prison.  Learn to forgive and forget.  Vengeance is a dirty move. 

I stand by my previous statements addressing this misrepresentation of the facts. 

 




 Are you serious? You must not be American. Your's isn't even an unpopular perspective here. It's virtually nonexistent. Then you're ignoring the fact that gun ownership is an inalienable right under protection of the 2nd amendment.  




 Were the residents adequately compensated? I didn't see anything in the article that explained this.  




 Best way to deal with a meth head is to put a couple bullets in their head!  I think the new legal system should work on votes from the community wether pieces of shit like this get to keep their life. 

Maybe this new system you're talking about should exclude votes from people who lack basic spelling and grammar skills.  




 It is 100% legal to abort a child at any time during the entire 9 months. 

That is unadulterated, Grade-A bovine excrement. 
 




 It's estimated that a large majority of people with substance abuse problems also suffer from mental illness. I think the number in my state, Missouri is around 80%. I'm sure that some of those people developed their mental health issues because of drug use, but it's generally accepted that substance abuse is often a symptom of mental illness or in other words self medicating.  




 This article suggests that a child costs $13,000 a year?  




 Seems to me like everyone having a gun is the problem here.

Or maybe it's that the police should stop violating basic constitutional rights and judges should stop enabling them.  




 Your perspective ignores what wealth is, where it comes from, and its purpose in bettering society.  




 So let's just forget about all of the people his unit killed, right? He's just an old man now and he's been really good since the war so let's just forgot about all of those grandmothers, grandfathers, mothers, fathers, sons, daughters, aunts, and uncles that they brutally tortured and killed? He was a member of the SS his job was to steal the personal possessions of the condemned innocent and catalog them to be included in the Reich's spoils of war. He's personally responsible for these atrocities whether you want to admit it or not. 

Since when did we drop the punishment/retribution aspect of prison sentences? Even the most progressive states view prison sentences as punishment. Sure rehabilitation is important, but that doesn't mean that people who commit atrocities should be able to avoid the consequences of their actions if they can demonstrate that they've been rehabilitated. He may die in prison. He may not. It's only a four year sentence. Will he even serve the whole thing? Who knows? But if he does die in prison it will be in better conditions and under better treatment than his organization ever afforded anyone. I've no sympathy for him now or ever. He's lived a long full life which is something that millions of people were never able to do because of him and people like him. Good riddance.  




 Do I think you should have a trust fund to have kids? No. **But you should be able to afford to send them to school with lunch and provide them with clothes and a safe and healthy environment**

And just how much money should that cost? How much of parents' time should have to go into earning this income? 

You're putting words into more mouth by trying to tell me what I support. I support families and their right to be together. I'm for supporting families and the children they have rather than drawing imaginary lines and standing on a stump telling everyone else how their families should live. I support finding solutions to our problems as a society, apparently you support hate and prejudice. 

Edit:typo. 
 




 Exactly. These guys should really open a book or five before opening their mouths.  




 Except it does. How about punishing him for his involvement in some of the worst crimes against humanity in recorded history? Maybe you weren't affected by his actions, but millions were. Think about it. Your best argument is that he shouldn't be punished because he got away with it for so long.  




 He was a member of the SS, attached to the camp, and intimately involved in its operations. His duty was to collect and catalog the possessions of the condemned like some hellish ghoul. This man and his actions are indefensible.  




 That analogy would make sense if the police department's only purpose was to work people to death and/or gas them, and the clerk was responsible for stealing and cataloging all of their things. 




 Unfortunately, it seems that today you cannot be a public official without first being a millionaire.  




 It can mean that they're hateful racists.  




 I know. He was a member of the SS who was attached to the camp. What more does one need?  




 Exactly. He was in the fucking camps. His job was to collect the possessions of the condemned like some evil ghoul from hell. This is worse than a Wehraboo. These guys are arguing that one could be attached to the camps and intimately involved with their operations and still be considered "innocent".  




 Yeah, the first sentence is the link.  




 Okay, thanks for the source. It doesn't prove your point, but thanks anyway. 

In 1970 the top marginal tax rate was 70% not the 90% of the fifties. Your link says that the effective tax rate was 33% on couples earning $12,000 or more. Where do you think that puts the super wealthy? 

Furthermore the top average effective tax rate today is not 33% like the article suggests. [It's more like 21%] (http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/01/18/us/effective-income-tax-rates.html?_r=0) and when you consider sales taxes our current system is regressive with median income families paying at least the paying at least that much or more. 

Yes loop holes allowed and still allow the wealthy to weasel out of their tax obligation, but undoubtedly they paid more before Reagan began thisrace to the bottom with our marginal tax system.  




 This one's pretty fucked up too. 

This is idiotic charging a book keeper for the said crimes. That would be like charging a clerk at a police department for police brutality when another officer committed the offense. 

Edit: Here are the full comments. https://np.reddit.com/r/MorbidReality/comments/3dd8dw/auschwitz_bookkeeper_oskar_groening_sentenced_to/ 




 And how would you define that? Where do you draw the line and how?  




 That's just what Darth Vader would look like if he were on Squidbillies.  




 Chesticles.  




 I think the number of people who died at the hands of his unit is pretty morbid. Can you imagine this guy going through all of the personal belongings of the people who were to be worked to death and/or gassed? How far did it go? Was he responsible for counting gold teeth and such? 

Edit: grammar. Removed an extra "the".  









 What do you mean?  




 I fun looking at your pics of dead kids.  




 I like this one better than the first.  




 Go thump your bible somewhere else.  




 [Are you sure about that?] (http://taxfoundation.org/article/us-federal-individual-income-tax-rates-history-1913-2013-nominal-and-inflation-adjusted-brackets) It's worth noting that the effective tax rate would be the same during those years with a high top marginal rate because employers would not pay much into the top margin as it was a waste of money. Why pay someone more when it's just going to go to the government? 

Edit: I love how I provided a legitimate source and you simply downvote me. You made unsubstantiated claims and could not resist the urge to use some shitty slang to describe the people you disagree with.  




 "Sun comes up, sun goes down. Tides goes out, tide comes in. There's never a miscommunication. You can't explain that!"  




 what sin is is just religious guidelines as law, but if you already knew about law youd know people 3000 thousand years ago had laws too


I know damn well about the history of cannon law. Religion is not the basis of US law. Sin encompasses stupid shit that cannot be considered crime like masterbation, apostasy, blasphemy, idolatry, vanity, and so on and so forth.  




 So are you talking about the [50 million Americans living beneath the poverty line] (http://www.npc.umich.edu/poverty/), the [46% that have less than $800 in savings] (http://money.cnn.com/2013/06/24/pf/emergency-savings/), or would you prefer people to be in the top 75% in order to have kids. I mean, we just want to be clear about who you think should be allowed to reproduce, because this is important. You've made it clear that people cannot love their children unless they make a certain level of income and I would really like to know just where you've drawn this line.  




 It didn't. It's not. But methods of production and their outputs have increased incredibly. If we actually implemented these processes properly our civilization would be entirely sustainable and resilient.  




 We're still extracting all of the metals we need. We're more efficient than ever at extracting and utilizing these materials. More can be done to recycle them, but they're not so scarce* that we're going to run out any time soon. I addressed the rest of those things in my other comment.  




 Fossil fuels production is at a high right now and expected to increase. Arable land isn't diminishing in the US and it's pretty well known that we can do more with less land than any other time in human history. Yes, fresh water is a problem but it is solvable. First and foremost we should be focusing on preserving the fresh water we already have.  




 Which resources are becoming more scarce?  




 What finite resources are decreasing? I mean sure we're using plenty of resources but much of this consumption has led to an increase in the extraction and production of materials. What resources do you think should be more difficult to obtain and therefore more expensive?  




 So only the wealthy should be able to have kids?  




 Because he's a fucking joke. He's always been a ridiculous hack, and now he wants to be a ridiculous hack that holds the highest political office in the country. He doesn't deserve to be taken seriously by any legitimate news source. He needs to be called out and ridiculed.  




 So what you're saying is if all doctors started doing this unpleasant part of their jobs, there wouldn't be this problem.  




 Did I? How so? Please explain to me how "sin" is more objective than either of those. Explain how sin is of any consequence to those outside of your belief system. 

Edit: I want to point out that you opened yourself to that simple honesty by stating that sin was real. You could have just disagreed with what you read and moved along. You didn't have to make an unsupported and unprovable assertion.  




 You're right he resisted by putting his hands up and saying no. Those officers had no choice but to choke him. /s 




 Yeah, I wonder about that part.  




 No murder is a crime. Sin is an imaginary concept. Much like a person's aura, ESP, any other such superstitious nonsense.  




 Sin is an imaginary disease invented to sell you an imaginary cure.  









 Disgusting.  




 You're being too gentle. I would have called him a vile, murderous psychopath who most certainly should have been executed after the war with the rest of his traitorous, slave-driving co-conspirators.  




 This is why we need to restore the top marginal tax rates to their pre-Reagan levels. In that tax system ridiculous executive salaries and bonuses were prohibitively expensive because after a certain point the company would would have to pay a dollar to every $.30 that the executive received. Under that system the shareholders wouldn't stand for these crazy benefits that executives have grown to expect.  




 From the job creators of course. Don't you know that the wealthy ruling class is just waiting around with all of that capital for all of those people to go to HVAC school. Then they'll share some of the economic gains the country has made in the last five years.  




 Of course they're lazy. What do you call working 60 - 80 hours a week just to pay your immediate living expenses while slipping deeper and deeper into debt?  




 I completely agree, but who are we to argue with those who feel it's necessary to maintain a population of people who are* even less than second class citizens. "They broke a law (who cares if they were fleeing crippling poverty, exploitation, and persecution) they should be thankful to shine our shoes in constant fear that they'll be rounded up into camps and deported back to the chaos from which they escaped".  




 Thanks for clarifying that for us. I'll get that data disseminated to the masses. 

**Attention! Attention!**

**You lazy fucks can do "better". Do it now. That is all.** 




 You're right! I've been telling these people who work for a living that they should be ashamed of themselves and generally depressed so that they'll just give up and off themselves. It's not enough that they have to do the work that the rest of us refuse to do, they need to suffer as people and in their interpersonal relationships too. Human dignity is a luxury and if you can't figure out how to benefit from the enormous return your employer gets from your labor then you don't deserve to enjoy the status of "human being". 




 You're absolutely right. It wouldn't fix everything so we shouldn't do it. It's kind of like how having clean drinking water didn't cure all diseases so it was just a waste of time.  




 Absolutely. Also, it's important to remember that employers would pay their employees **much more** if it wasn't for the government making them pay the minimum wage. The government is artificially lowering wages. That's what **minimum wage** means.  




 Yeah, she could have done better. Maybe she'll try a little harder the next time such a rare specimen is in her court room. Personally, I would have went with something that used the phrase "like a boy".  




 He's figured out how to solve the national problem of poverty! Just don't be poor assholes! If you were wealthy you wouldn't be poor. Figure it out already.  




 It's not the only way to write a title but it is a universally accepted method in the United States.

 [The Myth of Nathan Bedford Forrest] (http://personal.tcu.edu/swoodworth/Ashdown%20 %20Caudill-MNBF.htm)  














 Right, because kids need parents a lot less than employers need wage slaves. Everyone knows that each and every one of us owes our very existence to the corporate class that rules us.

 You mean that medicine appears disproportionately in a sub about health?

 That's fine. The federal election commission and IRS will most likely want to have a few words with him about the fact that he's on the [corporate board of the biggest donor to his superpac] (http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/07/rick-perry-kelcy-warren-super-pac-energy-transfer-partners). I'm pretty sure that what he's doing constitutes collusion and coordination.  




 The reason I cited ~~APA~~ MLA guidelines is that they are generally accepted by universities and colleges. My English professors made us all buy the APA book and follow the rules that are defined within. In other words, you just tried to insult someone for using an almost universally accepted method of writing.  




 That's a perfectly legitimate way to type a title under ~~APA~~ MLA guidelines.

 Yeah that's good stuff. Delicious and easy.  









 There are nurse's, truck drivers', and contractor's unions and they have to carry insurance.  




 How about the revelation that Perry is on the [corporate board of the biggest donor to his superpac?] (http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/07/rick-perry-kelcy-warren-super-pac-energy-transfer-partners) I can't think of a clearer case of coordination or collusion.  




 Make them pay for it. Make officers carry professional liability insurance.  




 A violent homophobic police officer in the NYPD? That can't be right. /s 




 Oh yeah, it's perfectly acceptable that the officer slammed a small teenaged girls face into the tile floor while she was handcuffed because she kicked him in the chin. We can't have that officer's ego getting bruised. Who knows what kind of awful things she said to him? Teenage girls are mean. That poor brute.  




 $2 million worth of legal defense doesn't make it sound like they have a weak case to me.  




 Were you expecting electromechanical mechanisms under your skin?  









 I'm for more and more radical reforms, but I don't see that happening any time in the near future. 

What information are you talking about? Insurers already rely solely on the information they* receive from PDs to make decisions about drivers. Police are notoriously bad about properly filing accident reports and whatnot. This would put the police and IA in a position of criminal liability if they fail to properly report incidences, and the insurance companies in a position to press criminal charges against dishonest and unprofessional officers. These days you're not a person unless you're a corporation. Let them answer to their insurers. The communities certainly aren't getting an adequate response to their concerns. 

Insurers would have an obvious interest in protecting their investments from unprofessional and reckless officers. Once an insurance company has assessed the risk involved with insuring each individual officer, I don't see why premiums would have to be any higher than they are for nurses or truck drivers. Officers with bad records would have high premiums or would simply be denied coverage. Problem solved. In assessing the risks of insuring officers in the field the companies would inadvertently be assessing their risks to our communities and weeding out those who were unacceptable.  




 *indicted  




 An Atlanta Journal-Constitution/Channel 2 Action News investigation of the case found that:

- Glynn County police officers interfered with the GBIs investigation from the start, seeking to protect the officers.

- The department tampered with the crime scene and created misleading evidence that was shown to the grand jury.

-  The local district attorney shared the states evidence with the officers nearly two months before the grand jury convened and cut an unusual deal with them just before it met.

 




 No, they get off on violence and hurting people.  




 It assumes no such thing. But it does put the burden of defense and the liability on an insurance company rather than the tax payers and justice system. Let an insurance company investigate and explain the actions of their premium holders. If they can't, let them assume liability and terminate the policy. The officer will then be uninsurable, out of a job, and no longer a threat to the public. It also separates the criminal and civil liabilities of the job. Tax payers need not pay for crimes committed against them.  




 I'm a Democratic socialist and I agree that police should be held to at least the same liability standards as we hold nurses, doctors, contractors, and truck drivers.  




 Recently it came to light that he is personally on the ~~payroll~~ [corporate board of the biggest donor to his superpac?] (http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/07/rick-perry-kelcy-warren-super-pac-energy-transfer-partners). I wonder if anything will come of that?  




 Yep. I remember KMFDM was one of the groups they blamed for Columbine. Totally ridiculous.  














 That's terrible that they blame music for the actions of human beings. Millions of people listen to metal and never harm anyone.  




 Why? Its not relevant here. You're obfuscating the actual causes of these atrocities by citing unrelated incidences.  




 In my state we do.  




 /r/BCND totally supports your right to kill yourself. Anything you need to get it done, just let us know.  




 No you're right. There's nothing suspicious about this situation at all. Go back to sleep everyone /u/NodbuggerX said everything is fine. Nothing to worry about here.
