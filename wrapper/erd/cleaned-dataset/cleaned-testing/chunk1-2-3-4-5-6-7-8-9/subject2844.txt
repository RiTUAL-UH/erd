 I apologize for all the nice folks in the USA. I've always encouraged my friends to be mean to foreigners. We are still working on it, but hopefully we will have everything in order by the time you visit. Have a lovely day...asshole ;)

 The Lost pilot is pretty captivating 




 I showed up to my construction site early one day and found this guy that would hang around the site all the time named Vito blowing a guy. Found out later that he got killed in a terrible way. 




 That's a crappy situation 




 Did the Ginger make it? 




 I was at a party in college drinking and having a good time when a few kids came over that were looking for some trouble. We were out on the front lawn asking their group to move onto the next party and stop causing trouble and they were getting more and more riled up. My buddy put his hand onto one of them to ask them to move down the block when another kid suckerpunched my friend and knocked him out. He immediately took off running, as we gave chase, and he started to run across the street. Right as my buddy grabbed the back of his shirt, the kid got plowed into by a car.

It was a grisly scene. The kid was hit so hard that he went through the car window. He was slumped over the steering wheel of the car and the driver was sitting there motionless with a look I will never forget. The kid's leg was backward and his bone was sticking out of his leg. He was unconscious for a while and we called the cops to send an ambulance as quickly as possible. He woke up after a while and started screaming in pain and trying to pull himself out of the windshield. He was cutting his hands up real bad and a few of us had to restrain him from hurting himself any further. 

Several cops, ambulances, and firetrucks showed up and eventually he was removed from the windshield and taken to the hospital. The car was going 32 MPH according to the police after they measured the skid marks from the car's brakes. The dean of student affairs interviewed me a few times about what happened and told me that the kid had numerous broken bones including the compound fracture of his leg, internal bleeding, a major concussion and needed over 400 stitches. My buddy that grabbed his shirt had to get glass removed from his hand and needed several stitches. The good news is that the kid recovered and returned to school after a few months. I will never forget the whole experience, it was such an intense situation. In a flash of time, a kid's life could have ended, but he luckily was spared. We were obviously pissed at the kid for hitting my friend, but I would never wish that on anyone. 

**TL;DR:** A kid suckerpunched my friend, ran into the street and got hit by a car and ended up halfway through a windshield of a car with terrible injuries.

 On August 7th, 2007 I happened to be lucky enough to be offered to throw out the first pitch of a San Francisco Giants game, as part of Italian Heritage Night. My family booked the biggest block of group tickets and so the Giants ticket office gave us the opportunity to throw out the first pitch and my family chose me. Barry Bonds ended up breaking Hank Aaron's home run record that night when he hit his 756th home run. I ended up getting him to sign the baseball after the game. The ball has my name, the date and the Giants logo monogrammed on it.  




 What a dingleberry move on your part! 




 Phil....Phil Connors? 




 Zero fucks were given that day 




 My cheeks get flushed and sweaty when I eat green apples. I never really noticed that this was unusual until I was wiping some perspiration off my cheeks and my girlfriend asked me why my face was so red. I told her about it and said that I thought this happened to everyone when they ate tart things. She laughed at me, called me weird and assured me that this was not normal. Am I dying? Is this a actual medical affliction?

 I always thought it would be really cool if they rebooted the series with a new Entourage. It could center around a young, upcoming rapper and his entourage. It could have some of the same players (Ari Gold, Billy Walsh, etc) but have a fresh new feeling to it with an all-new cast of characters. I would have loved to see something like that. 




 Maybe a 5 or a 6, I just have seen every episode and picked up on it part of the way through reading your well-written post. Funny stuff.

 I have a hunch that he didn't throw for another touchdown that game haha. 




 Holy shit dude! 




 Tearing your achilles sounds like a terrible injury. 




 Glad your friend was ok. A friend of mine got hit in the throat in a lacrosse game a few years back. He took a pretty hard shot (80-90 mph) right in the trachea and had to go to the hospital, but he also ended up being okay. Just some trouble breathing for a few days.  




 That is an absolute nightmare 




 That is tragic 




 Please share your stories of terrible injuries you have seen during a sporting event, either while on the field or in the stands. I know you Redditors have seen some crazy things before, shock me!

 I'm not sure who to believe on this post. However, you posted a well thought out, seemingly informative and reasonable post that seems to be from a level of experience. Most posts in Reddit claim to be from someone in that field, when you can sometimes tell the person is just trying to make something up to sound smart or for karma. You are the only post in here on the other side of things, but you don't have that armchair professional air to your rhetoric. I can appreciate that. Have an upvote.

 But first, lemme take a selfie! 




 I couldn't care less about whether I get upvotes or downvotes. I dislike when people try to put words in my mouth. You are drawing some wild conclusions. You continue to try to infer things from my posts that couldn't be further from the truth. You are free to try to interpret my anti-terrorism rhetoric however you deem necessary. After all, it is a free country! 




 You are a complete idiot Cyan. I am of the belief that if you are responsible for a terrorist attack on the United States of America, you should be taken down with swift vengeance. I made no references to the power granted to the NSA or condoned the intrusion of people's basic civil liberties. I would have never guessed in a million years that I would be downvoted for condemning terrorism. Pretty disgusted with this thread right now!

 It's not about wrong or right, it's all a matter of opinion. Interested to hear what dinosaur you think is the most badass. 




 Those things are like the hyenas of the dinosaur world. 




 What about the Gigantosauras? 




 Hahaha the Megalodon must have been frightening beyond comprehension for everything else in the ocean! 




 Pterodactyls were absolute death from above! 




 What that real? 




 What was the fiercest dinosaur in your opinion? 




 That was an awesome link. I didn't even know about the Gigantosauras. That dinosaur sounds fierce as hell! 




 Mammoths were pretty huge! You wouldn't want to catch their horns. 




 What was the most badass dinosaur in your opinion? 




 Haha dodo birds! 




 That's one huge bird! I bet it had some serious talons. 




 I was watching Cosmos tonight and it made me wonder what was the most interesting/badass animal to ever inhabit Earth?

 You hit the nail on the head. It's the Seahawks fan who still have the price tags on their jerseys. There are a lot of them out there and they don't know how to be proper fans, so they resort to being internet trolls. Not a good look! 




 Welcome to the club my friend!

 He's blocked me on 3 different Twitter accounts. He is the ultimate hack. He flings mud against the wall and sees what will stick. If you question him or disagree with him on Twitter he will block you. You can't be a total fear mongerer and then be a big pansy when people call you out on your shit... 




 I came here to say just that, glad you have the top comment!  




 Love it, my Berner thinks he's a lapdog too and he's 105 pounds. Bernese mountain dogs are the best dogs on the planet!

 RIP Oscar, Giants fans all over are sending positive thoughts to your family in this tough time. 




 Cute pup! 




 Awesome picture my friend! 




 Beautiful San Francisco? 




 Ya but as we saw last week, the Rams seem to run out of steam in the second half. I personally hope that this is the beginning of a long unraveling for the Seahawks. 




 My buddy ran into them at Best Buy tonight. They must have been going on quite the shopping spree! 




 There was a runner on first and the ball got by AJ. Since the runner would advance on the passed ball, he flopped on Ishikawi's backswing lightly grazing him so that the runner couldn't advance.

 My dog ate one of my fiance's socks and had to have 4 feet of his intestines removed. He has a bit of a sensitive stomach now, but he doesn't eat socks anymore.  




 I have a Bernese Mountain dog and he is the most gentle dog on the planet. He thinks he is a lap dog, despite being 105 pounds. Also, he is so sweet and gentle with children and other dogs. He is simply the best! 




 Epic photobomb! 




 What is your dog's name? My bernese loves to dig holes too. He gets so dirty though haha. 




 That's incredible! I would love for Cooper to live to 14. I walk him frequently and shower him with love. He is simply the best! 




 They have a high likelihood of cancer and joint problems. Mine is 5 and healthy as can be. I hope he lives forever, that would be ideal! 




 My berner loves to snuggle! He always cries until you give him some form of physical contact. Big old dogs that are extremely gentle and loving. 




 My cheeks sweat when I eat green apples. It's pretty weird and I've never heard of that happening to anyone else. 




 Berners are the cutest puppies. I have a 5 year old Berner and I always melt when I look back at pictures of him as a puppy. 




 "Omar don't scare." 




 Replying so I can listen to this later 




 Did nobody else get the reference? It's even more clear when you look at OP's username haha. Well done Costanza! 




 I feel bad for those poor husbands 




 Touch sir 




 You wear a condom when you have sex with your wife?  




 Ya we should probably set that up. Put him on a leash and drag and kick him around like he did to his puppy.

 It woke both my girlfriend and me up. That was a serious shaker. 6.1 has got to be the second biggest earthquake since 89'. I am all for smaller earthquakes, as I figure that will take some pressure off of the fault lines, but I'm not gonna lie and say I didn't jump out of bed and quiver like a little girl haha. Earthquakes are no joke.

 Hello Elon, huge fan! I actually just bought some additional Tesla stock yesterday because I love the direction you are taking your company. I have two questions for you:

1. What do you think the auto industry will look like in 10 years?

2. Will Tesla foray into the driverless automobile sector at some point in the future?

Thanks in advance and good luck tomorrow!

 Couldn't agree more with this analysis. I honestly think that the players love playing for Harbaugh, but at this point they know they are playing for a coach that is going to be forced out after this season and it is completely toxic. Jed York and Baalke are going to run this ship into the ground and it's so sad to watch. I feel the worst for Frank Gore. That poor, poor man. He deserves better than this!

 What it comes down to is that I'm borderline sexist and don't really find women ensemble casts that funny. If you enjoy those comedies though, who am I to judge. Carry on. 




 I'm well aware I can trade stocks on my own. My financial advisor is one of my best friends. He's very smart, knows the stock market more intimately than me and has invested my money quite successfully for me. I pick some stocks myself, but he also comes to me with ideas when I have some money to invest. It's a nice personal and professional relationship. 




 I'm quite happy to learn I don't know who was in Bridesmaids or who will be in this lame all-female reboot of a classic franchise. I'm not even defending Marvel movies per say, I'm just saying that this sounds like the worst movie idea I've ever heard. 




 You want to see a Ghostbusters movie with the same cast as Bridesmaids. I didn't really think I had to explain why I felt sorry for you, but there you go. 




 I feel really sad for you 




 You'd rather see an all-female Ghostbusters that will surely tarnish the good name of a proud movie franchise than something like Avengers: Age of Ultron? 




 I am rooting for Bane to blow up the whole stadium. Hooray Team Bane! 




 Thank god I didn't bail on my Apple stock a few months back when it wasn't looking so hot.

Edit: I just checked and apparently Apple went down over 3 points today. Apparently beating all the forecasts and making $18 billion dollars in one quarter isn't enough for Wall Street. I know nothing about the stock market haha.

Edit 2: Texted my financial advisor and fellow redditors reporting, up 6% after close. Profit reported after the close of the market. Feeling good again!

 My apologies! She is quite majestic. I just got back from the snow with my Berner. I hated taking him away from it. He is so at peace in the mountains!

 Hahaha! 




 The older woman is Indianapolis Motor Speedway  chairman Mari Hulman George. She has been making the "start your engines" announcement for a long time now. The younger woman is her daughter Nancy George and as someone mentioned, was probably thrown off by Mari's strange timing. That being said, do not play around with this feisty old broad. She does not look afraid to backhand a bitch if they step out of line.

 Oops I had that mixed up. I read the book a few years back and it slipped my mind. I will edit. 




 There is a great book titled, Brothers Forever, written about Brendan Looney and his friendship with Travis Manion. "The enduring bond between a Marine and a Navy Seal that transcended their ultimate sacrifice." These two guys were very special people and the book is a touching tribute to them. 




 The duster is strong in this one 




 The thing is that there are very few low demand areas in the Bay Area. It is absurdly expensive everywhere.

 That's not how the real estate market works. 




 The problem with selling your house now is that while you will see a sizable profit, you have to buy at the top of the market too. Sell high, buy high. Also, you have to pay capital gains taxes on your profit...

 True that, I was speaking specifically about women because that clown was saying it was ok. Hitting anyone is unnacceptable.  




 Please fuck off 




 Not from the South. I'm from a place where hitting women is never acceptable. You must be from that other place. 




 You don't know shit about me. Bottom line is that you don't hit women. The fact that you are trying to defend a man slugging a woman is deplorable.  




 Who are your friends if this situation has presented itself more than once? 




 Hey, do me a favor, shut your face. There is no justifying coldcocking a woman in that manner. Peddle your bullshit elsewhere.
