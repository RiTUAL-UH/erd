 I'm the same. Mainly, though, for me, it's that both hands look pretty bad because I'm a n00b to this stuff.

My suggestion is to stabilize your non-dominant hand with your dominant one. Put your dominant pinkie on your non-dominant palm for painting the thumb, then do the same with your thumb for the others. Works for me on both sides, since I have really shaky hands. 




 What is that glitter? I love it! 




 So Long, Astoria. 




  Franais! and Chers amis, bouvons! with friend who speak French.

 Upvote to OP for being a (rare as fuck) female on reddit. 




 As a poor college kid who can barely afford Kamchatka, yours is high-quality. 




 There is a method to the madness. I'm planning on putting candles in all these and strewing them about the house I live in next year. 









 Liquor before wine, gonna be fine. Wine before liquor, never been sicker. 




 I'd heard how good that was. Only reason we did this instead is because I had a really bad time involving schnapps, and I can't stand the stuff anymore. 




 I actually tried to minimize the tits in that photo. Didn't want to seem like a karma whore. 




 We shook it ever once in a while and let it sit for about 45 minutes, or until the candy canes dissolved. 




 If you want to take shots of it, use better quality vodka than we could afford. It may taste a bit like mouthwash, but spending a little more might minimize that. 




 We're poor college students, ok! I know it's retched. It was solely for mixing. 









 I saved this to print out and put next to my liquor cabinet. Thank you.
Edit: double post is doubled. Fuck my phone. 




 I saved this to print out and put next to my liquor cabinet. Thank you. 




 Be careful. Depending on how drunk they were,  they may very well have given you the wrong number. Or,  I suppose,  depending on how attractive you are. But I'll give you the benefit of the doubt  




 As a hot young lady who has recently been played like a card by a hot young man, I can understand.

Fuck boys, then only men I need in my life are Jack, Johnnie, and Jerry. 




 I've been frequenting this subreddit, jealous of all of you in your ability to still get drunk. Next year, I shall be able to go to the liquor store and will be doing so for the family (I'm the one who always gets the stuff for food anyway, they told me they can't wait till I can buy the booze, too). Scotch and ginger ale. Seems bad, considering teh cost of the Scotch, but fuck it, I gotta pilfer anyways. 




 If you're like me, you'll be wasting a lot of green if you try to hand roll. My fingers are just not nimble enough for it, and since I mainly smoke rolled things, using a roller is ideal, for time's sake. 




 I'm an American, and my best friend and I are the only people I know who smoke spliffs often. It might have something to do with our pack-a-day habits, but we love our spliffs. 




 I usually don't upvote manis with crazy stuff glued everywhere (personal preference, do whatever makes you happy), but the Trekkie in me demanded it. 




 Why would it even matter if it was from a her or not? Unless you're guessing Craigslist for meeting another person (sketchy as hell), you can just have it mailed to you. If you're that nervous that a creeper will come, set up a P.O. box. 




 My ex boyfriend's sister was autistic, and I've never seen more beautiful art outside a museum, and even some of that was worse. I'm "gifted" (politically correct for smarter than most) and I can't draw a straight line with a ruler. I have another autistic friend who is on par with me, sort wise. It all depends. 




 Canadian Mist and Canada Dry. I call it extra Canadian drink, eh. 




 Thank you so much for the CoverGirl suggestion! I'd love to be able to spend $24 on one product, but I'm a poor college students, and clearly smokes are slightly more important to me  




 Thanks! I'll look into a lip primer while I'm searching for Christmas presents. 




 Might sound silly, but I'm guessing the blush should match the lipstick? Which means, for pale me, that wouldn't work for red lips. Also, I just use a light powder foundation on my face, so I don't really have a need to get translucent powder just for this.... 




 This is true, but it's becoming a bit of a pain, what with the fact that I have to touch up upwards of ten times a day, for cigarettes alone. I usually give up and wipe it all off before my first class of the day  




 As a smoker, I always have trouble keeping my lipstick from rubbing off in the center of my lips. Is there anything I can do to help this? I really want to wear lipstick more often, but I usually have to go to stain, which dries my lips out, or just balm.

Please, no responses about how bad smoking is for you, trust me, I know.

EDIT: I am a poor college student, so, while I'm sure things that are $24 per are great, they aren't really an option for me. 




 I was afraid I'd recognize it from the pictures. Thankfully, I didn't  




 That is much better than what the poor college kid must resort to. 

In case you were wondering, Extra Canadian Drink is a staple for me. Canadian Mist+Canada Dry. 




 Also if you aren't in one of the ten states with no exceptions. Because fuck Indiana. 




 Yes, she is. And condone is a great word. 




 Good, since I crossed it out for a reason. 




 Bah, I don't know how to delete my double post on mobile! 




 I'll give you a hint: I break rule 37; there are, in fact, girls on the internet. 




 They call me Jay/Cory/Gary, that's not my name! 




 Only do this if your roomie is cool. I don't condone starting roomie wars  




 Not midget. Midge. Like short for Margaret. Don't ask me why. 









 In the post regarding cold weather wear (not sure how to link on mobile), there seems to be indecision about how fashionable the tights, knee high socks, and skirt combination is. Personally, I think it's absolutely adorable. I do it often, with all different types of skirts. This http://www.imgur.com/AYb3O.jpeg is one example. Here http://www.imgur.com/w6VVy.jpeg is another. Maybe I'm wrong, but I think both work.

Thoughts? 




 There are herbal, legal, nicotine free smokes. The brand Extacy is coming to mind. These are usually damiana based, which is the herb on which most synthetic legal high chemicals are sprayed. Extra bonus: damiana tends to make you horny. 




 I live in Bumfuck, Indiana, and I have only not received texts if the other person didn't have my number right.

Edit: I a word. 




 Oh my goodness, yes. This one guy, I still talk to him a lot, but can't really have sex with him anymore (he's got herpes, I don't and want to keep it that way). I've had to step back multiple times because I started to want more than he did and I didn't want to torture myself.... yet I still would go to his bed almost at the drop of a hat. 




 Greater safety, yes. For a lot of women, however, spermicide causes pain, itching, and dryness. Allergies are also not uncommon (I've got one). 

For serious safety, wear a condom, but still dint finish inside her. I had a really paranoid ex who always did this. 




 Personally, even if the person is good at it, I hate having a tongue in my mouth that isn't my own. My ex was the first person to always do this, and I never knew what to do in return. 

I guess, try things like what she did to you. Take it slow, gauge her response. Don't just start by sticking your tongue down her throat. 




 Hmm, I always heard that as "shes ugly everywhere but her (butter) face." I like yours, too. 




 House music competition. Do you mean a music competition in-house, or a competition of different house music artists? 




 I used to not like them because I was bad at them and they seemed tedious. I got better with practice, because I wanted to please my partner. I had an ex to whom I gave at least one blowjob a day for six months. I got pretty damn good at it from that, if I may be so immodest. Now I just love knowing that those sounds and faces he's making are directly caused by me. It's a great feeling. 




 I think we may have the same ex, haha. I always had to start and end every session with head, and hardly ever was it reciprocated. At least I got better at it. 




 Valentine's Day babies, represent! 




 This particular guy would have been bad either way, he was a chauvinist. But yes, he got way too attached and I had to deal with him for a good while after it happened and I said I didn't want more.

I'm sure not all virgins would be like that, but I know I was and this guy was, so I just don't want to deal with it. Besides, it is a decent amount of responsibility, being someone's deflowerer. 




 Because of shitty legal reasons not related to alcohol, I have to go to AA meetings (ok, I could go to NA meetings, but a pothead fits better with alcoholics than meth heads) and I agree that it isn't a joke. A lot of people have to go for legal reasons, some people would get their children taken away if they didn't go, etc.

I understand the joke, and yeah, it's pretty funny. But actual AA meetings are some of the most depressing places ever. Not butthurt, just sayin. 




 As a female who has been called attractive who chugs her fair share of beers, I hope this is at least decently common. 




 From experience, I can only think of two: I don't sleep with virgins or Nazis.
I've deflowered a guy and it was very unpleasant for a while afterwards.
The other? I was in this guy's bed, we were making out and his shirt came off. I saw a giant swastika tattoo. I pushed him away, asked if he was a Nazi. "Does it make it better that it was a prison thing?" That was the day I learned that Nazis turn me off.  




 I personally can't tell a difference between any type of condom, or between sex with a condom and bareback.

The one thing I *can* tell, is the difference between a condom with spermicide and any other type of sex. I know it's probably just me, because I am violently allergic to the stuff (like, lips swell shut and out, sitting down is really painful for a few days), but I've heard from other non-allergic people that it is drying and irritating. 

I'd say go for normal lubrication on your rubbers, in case she is allergic. Because if allergic reactions in your nose or eyes are bad, allergic reactions on your ladybits are awful. 




 Partially because my GP is an ass, partly because I'm in college, but I just never bothered to renew my script after it ran out last September. I hadn't even thought of the waiting list. 




 20-year-old female. Lost my virginity about 18 months ago. 

Have had  piv sex with 15 people, only oral with 2. 

One six-month relationship, four month-or-two-long flings, five less-than-one-month flings, seven one-night-stands. 




 What is the context of this house party? Is it a small group of friends hanging out? Or is it a large group of people getting drunk and grinding all up on each other?

While assuming anything is bad always, getting it in at the end of the night would be more likely at the latter type of party. Just don't be that guy who invites her, goes separately, and tries to dance with her after she's seen you make out with four other girls (that didn't happen to me this weekend or anything). 




 Dodgeball: an excuse for good athletic children to beat the living shit out of the weaker ones in the name of "fun." 




 Pourquoi pas 'moi, en cuisinant du lait?' Trop difficile?

(Also, don't quote me on that verb tense, I've always been bad at present perfect)
Edit: grammar 




 I already had these views on love. We've got multiple soul mates, and yeah, attraction at first sight is a thing, but love is a completely different matter. Love involves personalities that work together, matching sex drives, equal levels of emotional attachment, and all sorts of other things. 




 I have to move out Friday. It'll be clean then. 




 The mobile phone is a beautiful thing. Auto correct is the best. 




 You gotta learn how to pour that shit, man. You gotta tilt both the glass and the bottle/can.

 WOOOOOO, KAWLWGE! 




 Is a beer ok? I don't have any liquor for shots. 




 See, this particular paper is just a long rant in French about how "one true love" and "love at first sight" is a load of bullshit. I have to reference a couple works of 19th century French literature (can you tell yet that I'm a French major?) which, from my knowledge of the texts, all have to do with either "love makes life miserable" or "everything in my life sucks and I hate it all." I get to write two short papers for the class, so one is dealing with love, the other will be dealing with how literature from before modern psychology effected the idea that mental health is something that one should be at least reasonably knowledgeable about.

I'm not in serious paper writing mode or anything.
 




 Yes. Yes it is. And my roommate and I both have fridges. Not bragging or anything.

Also, auto correct makes me happy

 Hello trees. I recently got arrested and had to give up the herb for a few months. I want to tell you all the story of how I learned that this plant is the best medication I could every ask for.

I'm a young female ent. I'm in college. I have a family history of depression, anxiety, OCD, and alcoholism. The first three have plagued me my whole life.

I did ballet for nine years growing up, which is not a healthy environment for a kid. It forces you, from a very young age, to try for perfection in every aspect of your life, which is simply unattainable and unhealthy. At age 12 I started cutting myself to cope with the feelings of inadequacy. By age 15 I was doing it every day. At 16 I was put on anti-anxiety medication by a doctor, which made me feel like an empty shell of a person. Instead of anxious and all the other emotions, I just felt no emotions. I was a bitch, and more people than I can count called me crazy on a daily basis. I didn't have any real friends, I never saw anyone outside of school.

Right before I graduated high school, I found an old childhood friend on Facebook. The same day he added me, he messaged me telling me we should hang out. Two hours later, I was in his car with some of his friends on the way to a beautiful lake in the country. We swim for a while, then get back up on the dock. He whips out a joint and lights it up. When he passed it to me, I said I had never smoked before, and his face instantly lit up. "Try it," he said, "you'll like it."

I had never felt so uplifted and happy in my life. It was like all the unnecessary, stupid worries that had always plagued me were dissolved from my brain. I just started laughing uncontrollably, almost crying because I had never been as relaxed as I was then.

I smoked every day for a year and a half. I got arrested, and as part of the treatment program the man put me in, I have to pass two piss tests. It has been two weeks today. I feel like I did for the six years leading up to that day. I have either gotten drunk or cut myself every day. I hate it. It is unhealthy, makes me feel like shit the next day, and isn't a good thing, considering the strong history of alcoholism in my family.

I am not applying to any graduate schools in states that don't allow medical marijuana. And I hope, if any of you other ents get to feeling low, anxious, and miserable like I've been and will be for the next few months, you will read this and remember: trees can help. I'm sure, for some of you, it won't, but for me, it is the best thing out there.

Toke one up for those who haven't yet discovered this magical plant. Not even for me, for that would be selfish. I hope that, one day, no one will have to cover up their bodies to hide from the embarrassment of self-inflicted injuries. No one will turn to the blade because they will have the herb instead.  




 Truth.... Still not something you want to put on Facebook. 




 A visible bulge is nothing compared to what (it seems like) lazy college students wear. I know precisely the shape of most of my male friends' penises, because they really enjoy the basketball-shorts-with-no-underwear look. If you can't see the shape of the head of your member, it's fine with me. 




 I was about to ask the same thing. Might have something to do with the fact that it's all I got in my last relationship, so I had to figure out what worked. Only time I've ever orgasmed from just PIV sex was in Cowgirl. 




 4/20 always lands in the middle of Little 500 weekend (bike race/best party weekend in the country). Which means my humble abode welcomes police from five neighboring counties, as well as some out of state ones. This year it's on the day of the men's race, also known as the day with the most arrests in the state, if I'm not wrong.

IU ent problems. 




 Being 14 is not an excuse for not understanding this. This is taught in basic health class from when you were young

Unless you went to a school with abstinence only sex education or (like me) none at all. Enough girls in my high school got pregnant that you'd think they'd put two and two together.
 









 Me too, although I've also heard those called pops or poppers. 




 The Blue Moon pumpkin ale is one of my new favorite things. 




 Uptoke for cowboy killers (my cigarette of choice). 




 I also see it as "wow, you're cool. No one can connect your face with all that illegal substance. And no one who doesn't approve can see." Be responsible with your trees, kids. Getting arrested really sucks. 




 I used to be like that. I hated being on top because I didn't know what I was doing. I either sat on the guy's dick or was folded over on top of him; either way, he was still doing most of the work.

Now being on top is second only to doggy. I do a lot of moving my hips by moving my body (former swimmer, it's a lot like the dolphin kick without the legs) and what are actually very similar to a man's thrusts, but with more emphasis on the back swing (if we're facing each other). I recently had some amazing sex on top doing this, I was able to be fucked as hard as I wanted without having to ask him to go harder.

As mentioned before, though, you are still a good lay if you keep doing what you're doing. If you want to do more, try adjusting the angle of your hips in missionary. To build up strength, try dancing around when you're alone. Focus on moving your hips in a circle while keeping your top half relatively still. It's a good ab workout, which never hurts anyway. 




 I've shaved every day for three years. Sometimes I get little bumps and it can get a little itchy at the end of the day, but I usually don't have any problems. 




 Because what else are those sad excuses for novels good for? 




 I do believe you go to the same school as me. Or I'm just high. Hoosier? 




 So, I've been seeing this guy for a couple weeks now, but we haven't gone on any real dates. We met and hit it off really well, but didn't really hang out. Then, three Fridays ago, he happens to be part of the crew I'm leading to a party (we're in college in my hometown, so everyone relies on me to know where places are) and I just sort of decide to make moves on him. We leave the party to get smokes and he decides to bum to me for the night. We leave with his roommate to go to another party, then we end up very drunkenly wandering around campus. I end up going back to his dorm and we have sex. Next day he comes over to my dorm, we cuddle under a blanket for hours and then he spends the night. We hung out nearly every day, sometimes spending the night. A week after that first night, he invites me over to his friend from home's house and he has his arm around me for most of the night as a lot of other people from his hometown come over. I went over there again last night with his roommate and got way too drunk and the guy ended up having to take care of me, which I hate. I apologize and he says it isn't a big deal and happens to everyone.

What's bothering me is that we haven't had the 'are we dating' conversation because I don't want to rush it, nor do I really even know what I want. However, multiple people have either asked me if we're dating, or congratulated me on my new 'relationship.' I'm very confused, because I don't think what we've been doing is dating, but other people seem to think so. Are we dating? We haven't gone out anywhere together, there's just an obvious mutual interest.

Tl; dr, I've been hanging out and having sex with this guy I'm into, but I don't think we're dating, despite what other people say. Are we? 




 It may not be great. It may hurt a bit. My first time was great, didn't hurt at all, and generally awesome, but that seems to be unusual. I fell into the 'we had sex, now I'm in love with you' trap, although that may be because I had known the guy since childhood. 

As for getting handsy, follow his lead. Start off with a hand in his hair and one on his neck. Slide one down his chest or his back. I like to lightly massage his shoulders. Then grab his hips, pull him in closer. If he touches any part of you, it's fair game to touch the same parts of him. I really like to rub all around his cock, but not touch him until he starts rubbing in between my legs. If he's not hard enough for you to feel it through his pants by then, don't worry. He'll get there. 









 This week I fucked a guy I've had my eye on for a while now. We went to a party with a bunch of friends, then decided to leave for another one. We were pretty drunk by the time we left the second party, and then had to make the trek across campus. We held hands and stopped on several benches just to cuddle and look at the stars. We got back to his dorm and sat listening to Pink Floyd's Wish You Were Here (one of my all-time favorite albums) while making out. Things got hot and heavy and I ended up spending the night. Next day he and his roommate come to my dorm just because and we ended up sitting cuddled under a blanket outside for hours and hours. Then he came to my room, we laid in bed and watched tv for a while before fucking. He spent the night and most of the day. 

Seems less like a sexual achievement, but I have been afraid to let myself just be intimate without having sex since I got out of my first LTR. I've had hook ups, and a short fling (I had to break it off because I started to have feelings that we both knew would never be reciprocated), but I feel so comfortable with this kid. I'm just going to let it keep happening and see where it goes, but I really think I could let myself get feelings for him without it being unrequited. 

Also, he helped me with my insecurities about my oral skills -- he had to stop me multiple times because I was "just too good at it." 









 This is one of my favorite things to do to a man. I LOVE doing it and looking up into his eyes as he gasps and moans. But maybe I'm just weird. 




 We can't help you Doug, we're too high. 




 I also am diagnosed with GAD, and I have tripped a few times. I dropped acid the first time three days after a massive panic attack, and it went fine. It may help you to write on yourself. I have seen people put "don't panic," "it's just the drug," or "enjoy yourself" on their arms. That can really help, because, if you get lost in your own head, you can look down and see the words. 

As has been said already, don't let yourself be alone. It is good to have a sober person with you, so that you have someone who knows to watch out for you. I think LSD and other psychedelics have helped me figure things out, including the sources of my anxiety.

I hope it turns out well for you. 




 This! 
And boys, if you didn't know why they put that warning on the stuff, its because, when you have a boner, the blood is trapped in there until you soften up. While the blood is trapped, it can't bring fresh oxygen to the cells in the penis. After four hours, a lot of those cells will have died. After long enough, the entire penis will die and, ultimately, fall off.

 Even better, just poke holes in the bottom of the bottle. Also, spray some febreeze into the sploof. 
























 Perhaps I just had a shitty therapist, but all I ever got from it was "you have a chemical imbalance in your brain, sucks, don't it?" Therapy just made me focus more on the stupid things, trying to figure out why they bother me. It ended up making me feel super self-absorbed, to the point that my very best friend told me to either change or get out of her life.

I worry less about what other people currently think, but rather what they may do if I pursue a certain want. 

I suppose my biggest concern with this philosophy is that it seems like it just makes us all into selfish little twats. All I want to do is help people less fortunate than I, but I get so caught up in how I might be hurting them that I just assume that everyone is better off without me. I know it's not true, but that little voice is constantly telling me I'm a burden or a bother. I've been getting better at pushing it aside, but sometimes I just can't see the point, if it's just going to come back.

Tl;dr: maybe I just can't not give fucks, when my ultimate goal is to help others. 




 I've been lurking on this sub for a while now. Every post is full of "your problems don't matter" or "just do it" or "be confident."

It isn't that easy. Anxiety is part of my identity. It's like telling someone with clinical depression to "just be happy." It's pointless, and a little bit offensive. I checked the sidebar, and in the "how to start not giving a fuck" post, literally all of them seem like completely insurmountable goals. How do you go from not knowing what self-confidence feels like to being super confident all the time?

I'd love to take your advice. But it's like telling rabbits to stop fucking and pooping. 




 That is my issue with this whole sub. I know I shouldn't give a fuck, but then I just get hung up on doing that. At least for me, not worrying about things takes away one of the only constants of my identity.  




 And if you can't control your own basic bodily functions, there's no way in hell you can consent, no matter how much you want it. 




 So you might fit into a 32" and a 34", depending on the store. That still seems more reasonable than fitting into a 2 one place and a 9 somewhere else. 




 I can see where they're coming from. I live in Southern Indiana, aka meth land, and knew a handful of kids who cooked in high school. It's an awful drug, and those hooked on it will do anything to get/make more.

That being said, I think this is a little extreme. You can still go buy Sudophed (sp?), just not boxes and boxes. Maybe putting a cap on the amount you can buy at a time would work better. 




 Dissociatives are not fun (in my opinion). Instead of passing out, expect to be having conversations with the giant spider on the wall or freaking out cuz you can't find your bread.

Edit: also, a benadryl overdose is serious business. Seizures, vomiting, coma, etc. Source: I took an od of it on purpose and am literally the only person who's been in my hospital for one, had seizures, and didn't die. Maybe I'm just paranoid, but don't fuck with this stuff. 




 They may be driven to have it cuz it feels good, but that isn't the reason. It's a biological imperative that happens to feel good. If it didn't, horses would go extinct pretty quick. 




 Yes, it does. When I make potent cookies, it makes the place smell like grandma and dank. Not safe to do until you've got your own place. 




 I had a buddy who turned it into a game: take a standard drink each time they say standard drink. Have fun ;-) 














 I'm not sure about him, but I (also from the midwest) could find a zip anywhere between $275-$315. 




 I decide what I want to make beforehand, and then get so excited at the prospect of fresh pastries. It's also been a bit of a zen activity for me for years.

The dough for these takes about six hours, so there's a lot of down time to get more stoned or watch some Netflix.  




 For the dough I just used Julia Child's croissant recipe. For the filling, I put some berries, sugar, flour, and lemon juice in a saucepan and let it cook and thicken over low heat while I rolled out and cut the dough. Use water around the edged to seal. Sorry I couldn't give a legit recipe, I usually just wing it.

 Madame. Madam is the head of a brothel.  









 Julia Child. I'm not sure which one has the most pastries, but french pastries are my schtick. 









 This is the best advice on this topic I've ever heard.

OP, everyone has to deal with relationships that just aren't right. And it hurts, because unless you're a sociopath, it really sucks to hurt someone else. I had a terrible, controlling, legitimately insane SO for a while. I loved him more than I could possibly say. I still do, even just for the good memories we made together. But we just weren't good together. "test_subject2886, shut up, you're about to say something you know nothing about" was a common thread. When I finally realized it wasn't working out, I agonized over the decision for weeks. I felt guilty for months afterward.

I've now been away from him for a year, and it was the best decision I've ever made. No one deserves a shitty relationship, but they help us figure out better what we need for a healthy, thriving one. So buy yourself some Ben Jerry's and remember that you've gotten through this frog, so you know you can do it again if you have to.

Tl;dr: we all have to deal with bad relationships so we can figure out what we need. 




 Sounds similar to my best Goodwill find: a vintage suede fringe jacket for $10. Looked up the tags online, turns out it's worth at least $300. I live for deals like this. 




 If you work it, as you clearly have been. Congrats!

 The other discussion is more relevant and informative, but from my experience this isn't necessary. I've never had a UTI, and I never make it a priority to pee right after sex. 




 Make sure to eat a lot of yogurt or other things with probiotics to prevent a yeast infection. The antibiotics for the UTI can mess with the levels of bacteria and yeast in the vagina, which can in turn create a yeast infection. Vagina problems are the worst. 









 That pretty perfectly describes how I am when I don't smoke weed. Clearly ymmv. 




 I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder and panic attacks on the regular. I am generally worried about something all the time. I smoke a spliff every morning when I wake up to calm myself down. Sometimes I get paranoid, but it only ever has to do with avoiding getting arrested. I have never had a panic attack while stoned. Just my two cents. 




 And a decent amount of them probably do, too. 




 That's my protocol as well. Also I don't ever seriously consider stupid tattoos. 




 Some places just don't have schwag. I can't even find mids in my town, and I've got several dealer friends.

 So, long story short, I make really idiotic decisions when it comes to boys.

I got played like a card by this guy for six months and all I have to show for it is a diagnosis of major depressive disorder and a short hospital stay. I decided it was a great idea to Facebook stalk him for a little bit tonight, and I ended up bawling my eyes out, just like every time I see or think about him too much.

I know that drinking my problems away will be bad in the long run, but tonight I'm killing what's left of a fifth of Captain and realizing that his new girlfriend is probably smart and funny and everything I'm not, but still holding onto the fact that she makes Sarah Jessica Parker look like she doesn't have a horsr face.

Tl;dr: fuck boys, fuck Facebook, and fuck ugly bitches.

 I'm going to give an opinion right now that I know is incredibly unpopular in this subreddit, because it's worked for me many a time.

I enjoy faking orgasms. I am a fairly orgasmic person, though. Usually what happens is that I'll be able to tell that a guy is about to come, and I start contracting my muscles. Doing that (depending on the position) also forces my hips into a position where my clit is getting stimulation, and seeing the guy feeling me get close usually sends me over into a real orgasm.

I have completely faked them during random hookups when I just knew that it wasn't going to go anywhere, and I don't find a problem with that. If you don't care for the person, an you know he won't be inside you again, you can do whatever you want, because the next person he sleeps with will be different from you and he'll have to learn how to please her specifically. 




 Hello all!

Today I splurged a finally got myself a bottle of Seche Vite. I used it straightaway but have a few questions. I searched and a few questions were resolved, but these ones I couldn't find answers to.

I didn't run into this today, but if I need two coats of a polish to get it opaque, do I need to let the separate layers dry before putting on the next coat, or should I do them all quickly and then seche on top while they're all still tacky? I don't mean between base color and art, that question has been resolved time and time again, I mean with light colors that require more than one coat to be opaque.

Secondly, how thick is a "thick coat" of SV? I figured it meant pretty think, but I got bubbles in it today. I know it isn't from the polish underneath, because I didn't see the bubbles while I was waiting for the polish to go from really wet to slightly tacky.

Thank you all so much! This stuff really is magical. 




 Maybe something to do with Doc Counsilman, the IU swimming coach back in the day who practically invented kinesiology as it relates to sport training?

 Also, I definitely turned this over for the picture and poured a little bit of vodka that hadn't evaporated from my last shot on my keyboard. Still seems to work fine.

 As someone who goes to college in their hometown (townies FTW!), I just ask my parents to let me have the car for a few hours as I load all my shit into four loads max in order to move back after the breaks.

 This afghan has gotten big enough that I think it will stay home. And the constant work has made my wrists hurt, and I can still get a good 8 hours of work done outside of the 4 hours I have class. 




 Hello all!

I am working on my first afghan ever, which I hope to give to my grandmother for her 92nd birthday on 3/15. I started it on Saturday, and am already making a lot of progress. However, I still think that I'll need to spend every free moment to work on it to get it done in time. 

I brought it to class with me today, because I've got about an hour in between some classes, but it is already so big that it takes up so much space in my backpack.

How do y'all deal with traveling with a huge project? Is there a magical folding technique I could use? If not, do y'all have any tips for bringing a project with you to places?

Tl;dr: how can I bring the afghan I'm working on with me without taking up a lot of space in my backpack? 




 Also, should I make sure to get a non-declawed cat to match my current non-mutilated one? I dont want any injuries. 




 Hello, another question. I trust Reddit on cat information.

I'm planning on adopting a new cat this Friday, because my 10.5-month old needs a friend. I'm planning on getting someone a little older than her. Do I need to make sure to get separate food for him? My current kitty is pretty much done growing at this point, and has started eating less (I fill her bowl up twice a day and she hasn't finished it in 30 minutes anymore), so I was wondering if I could start the switch to adult food yet. Or, could I feed a 12-15 month old kitten food for a couple months? I can afford getting separate food, but it would be nice if I could use the same.

Tl;dr: getting a new cat, hopefully not a kitten. Could I use the same food with my 10.5-month-old as a more adult cat? Either switch the current one to adult food or give the newbie kitten food. 




 This. I usually just spray it on my hairbrush and pass it through a few times, especially on the underside.

 I had a friend with epilepsy (or some other seizure thing) and remember the first time he had one in front of me. I'll tell you, it isn't pretty, although you can probably imagine that. We were out for a smoke and all of a sudden he looked out to nowhere and next thing I knew, he was on the ground seizing. My lifeguard skills kicked in, so I got him to the safety position and got someone to call for an ambulance, cuz it was his second that day. It was so scary, he didn't know what year it was, who the president was, anything. You're description helped me realize just how out of it you get. 




 I've heard that the bitter apple stuff or whatever doesn't always work. That's why I went for the polish first. 




 So, I posted a question a couple weeks ago regarding computer cords and that foul tasting nail polish designed to help you quit biting your nails. 

I've been putting a coat on a couple times a week and my cat hasn't chewed on my charger at all. I saw her try when I first did it, and she was licking her lips and I could tell that she had an unpleasant taste in her mouth.

Hope this is useful to anyone else. It's been a great solution for me.

Tl;dr: if your cat chews on your charger cords, coat the cords with Bite-It and it will help. 




 This may be better suited for the general discussions thread, but this stupid cold has got me thinking.

Does anyone else have old long sleeve shirts that are way too small to wear on their own, but make the best cold weather undershirts? I've got a black one from my goth phase (7-8th grade) that I've had on under my sweaters all week. Like, I know the shirt itself looks silly, but layers are awesome. 




 We had to put my family dog down 5+years ago, and this brought a tear to my eye. If I weren't broke, I'd give you gold. 




 That's literally the only way I can get the motivation to clean. I go full-on 40's/50's housewife. 




 Thanks! My sister says the clips were a free add-on when she ordered the brushes, and I don't eat chips, so I figured I'd put them to good work. 









 Less thought out than the earlier comment, but I'll give my two cents.

When I want to make a pattern, I just make a second of the same project. I write down what I remember doing for the first time, with plenty of room for notes. As I work up the new version, I change the blueprint as needed.

That said, I've only written three or four patterns before, and it was mainly to keep track of things when I was making big projects.

Wool leggings from REI, neon t-shirt from Michael's, homemade black cowl. 




 I don't have the money right now for a new one, I'm probably going to put a little away until Spring Break. 

Should I put my current cat's litter box near the door? The only viable option in my apartment for that would be to have the litter box in my bedroom, in front of the bathroom door, and I would almost certainly step in it.

If I put two hanging toys on either side of the doorknob, would that help socialize them when I'm in class?

I plan on going to the shelter fairly often to play with the available cats, and see which ones have similar personalities. I just think someone with almost as much energy would chill her out so much, because she's always running around and trying to play with everything. 




 Haha, when I brought my Katie home for Thanksgiving, we heard her meowing for almost an hour and didn't see her, which is unusual. Turns out she was in the cupboard with the trash can, and she didn't seem phased at all. 




 I've searched, so I know the basics of bringing a new cat home, but my situation leaves me with some questions.

Katie is a 10-month-old barn cat. She's been with me and strictly indoor since she was 12 weeks old, but she is sassy and spastic as hell. We've had playdates with other people's cats, and she has always terrorized them, even though she's tiny. My best friend's 13 pound Mane Coon hides whenever they've been together. 

Is she too much of a terrorist to adapt to another cat?

Also, my apartment only has one inside door, in the bathroom, and my bathroom is tiny. To keep them separate for a bit, would keeping the newbie in the bathroom be ok?

Katie lived with two rabbits for a couple months, and got along great with them, but I'm definitely not getting a rabbit (I lost so many cords in my 2.5 months of living with rabbits).

She is seriously tiny. She's maybe 7 pounds, was the runt of her litter, and hasn't gotten any bigger for a few months.

EDIT: I'd go to shelter and see what's available, but I think getting a fixed male between 8 months and 1.5 years old would be best. I think she'd get along better with a rambunctious friend who's bigger than her.

Tl;dr: I think my cat could use a friend, but she's always terrorizing any other cat she's met. My apartment is small. Could I get another cat and keep him in my bathroom? 




 Background: I am a political science major, and have wanted to work in the public sector for as long as I can remember.

 Great! Maybe I can save my oil, then. 




 Ive had incredible luck when it comes to acne/clogged pores. I wash my face every time I shower and have never had a serious breakout.

I'll prolly just use my vegetable oil, because most of the benefits of coconut oil I already have: my hair grows too fast; I use henna to dye my hair, which conditions; I don't scar too bad. 




 I've searched both here and /r/MakeupAddiction, and couldn't find an answer to this specifically.

I've seen a lot of posts saying sugar+olive oil is a good lip exfoliant, but I usually don't keep olive oil in my house (my family has a history of low cholesterol, so I use butter for everything). Would sugar+vegetable oil do the same thing? I've got vegetable oil for in case I decide to make a cake from a mix.

Tl;dr: does sugar+vegetable oil exfoliate lips as much as sugar+olive oil? 




 I'm planning on getting a nude lip liner when I go grocery shopping next, because mine ran out. For every day, I'd be more careful and use a brush, I was just excited to swatch these. 









 One of my best friends has worked at a pet store for 1.5 years, so I definitely asked her. Like I said before, I'm going to try the Bite-It, and if that doesn't work, I'll go with something citrus.  




 Katie may be teething right now, I've read it happens several times in the first year and she's been chewing on everything much more in the last month or so (even the corner of the bag of kitten food), so hopefully it will pass. But I've got several options now. 




 Yeah, my problem is that she pretty much only chews when I'm not watching, which makes me think that she knows not to do it. 

I'm trying the Bite-It for now, but I've got lemon spray too, if I find her chewing. She tried earlier and was then licking her lips to get the taste off, and I'm guessing the tiny bit she might get from that won't be too bad for her. 




 Thanks!

I'm worried, because I've heard several stories about bitter apple not working, and my baby chews on or licks pretty much everything.

Would lemon wood polish spray work?

I'm going to ask the guys at the tech store when I get my new charger. 




 I asked a similar question on a thread in /r/cats, but you ladies (and gents) might know, too.

My 10-month old kitten chews on my MacBook charger and ruins it. I'm going to buy my third in a month, and at $80 a pop, it's getting expensive. She only does it when I'm not looking, which makes me think she already knows not to do it.

Can you coat a charger with that foul tasting nail polish designed to help you quit biting your nails? I think that would deter her, but I'm not sure if it's safe for the charger or the cat. I know not to use anything spicy, but no-bite is just chemicals that taste horrid (I've used it, and the spicy kind, which just made me want to suck on my fingers more because I love spicy food). If not, I can get some bitter apple stuff, as /r/cats suggested, but it's a long hike followed by a long bus ride to get to a pet store here. Maybe Kroger would have some in the pet department.

Tl;dr: cat chews on power cord. Can I coat my new charger in no-bite to keep her from ruining another? 




 I know this is an old post, but do you think coating the cord in that foul tasting nail polish designed to help you quit biting your nails? Would that damage the cord? I'm about to buy my third MacBook charger in a month, just because I take away any short strings so my baby won't choke.

EDIT: I think she knows not to do it, because I never see her chewing, but when I come back inside after a smoke, the cord is ruined. 




 I've been crocheting for about 10 years now. My mother taught me the basics, and I just figured the rest out for myself. About 4 years ago I finally realized that what I had been calling single crochet was actually a slip stitch, and my double crochet was actually single. 

I've tried following patterns for things in the past, and the things always end up too big or just strange. I can kind of read them (at least, I understand the whole "ch4, slst into first, ch1 and dc into next st, repeat 4 times" thing, but nothing ever works right.

That being said, I have successfully made hats, socks, scarves, and even a dress with my limited knowledge. If I want a fancy stitch, I can look up the stitch itself and then incorporate it into whatever I'm making. Patterns can be nice for a basis (I needed on to figure out heels the first time I made socks), but I find it much easier to just do my own thing. Increase, decrease as you need to, but once you know sc, dc, inc, and dec, you can make anything. Anything that requires a close fit, just make sure to fit check every couple of rows (when I made socks for the first time, I slipped them on even more often) and don't be afraid to undo a lot of work if something didn't go well (I also had to redo the toes on my first pair of socks ~6 times).

Idk the point of this post, really, but I searched for something similar, and nothing really came up.

TL;DR: you don't have to be able to read patterns to make things, you just need to be willing to do fit checks super often, and to pull things out if you realize what you're doing is wrong. 




 I've made several. First, measure from your waist to however long you want your skirt to be. Then, measure around your waist and every couple of inches going down the length. Divide each of these numbers in four. Cut two kinda funky rectangles that are as long as you want and as wide as you need at each point you measured. I usually put dots at each measurement point, then connect them. Using the same measurements, cut the front on the fold so it will fall flat. Sew all the rectangles together, put a zipper in the back, hem, and voila!

This is how I always make them, although having a waistband could be nice, too. There are better tutorials with picture online. 




 Munster is around 4.5 hours from me, but I've got some friends from the region, so I'll ask them if they'd be down for a trip. Quite a few Three Floyd's brews are available near me, so at least I've got that going for me. 




 I'll be on the lookout for all of these. Since I can get Harpoon cider, I'll bet I can find others. Thank you!

Edit: my Kroger had Harpoon ipa, and it's pretty good. And def good for a beginner's ipa 




 I'm in southern Indiana.

Edit: but my health food store has a huge selection, but a large portion of it is international.  




 Hello all! 

I decided for my new year's resolution that I would become more of a beer connoisseur. Both my local grocery store and my local health food store have really excellent build-your-own six pack selections, so I've been picking up one or two of those a week.

To be honest, I prefer a good cider to just about anything (Harpoon Craft Cider is my favorite thing ever), but I also like a good beer. However, most of the selection at Kroger is ipa's and apa's. I'm really not a fan of pale ales, or really anything that is super hoppy, but I'd like to build a taste for it.

Wheat beers are probably my favorite, and Upland Wheat Ale is one of my favorite beers, although that might just be because it's widely available where I live. Of the mix-a-sixes I've made, my favorites were Baltika #4   9, Two Brothers Ebel's Weiss, and Boulevard Unfiltered Wheat beer.

What are your recommendations to start my journey away from dark lagers and wheat ales?

To;Dr: I would like to expand my beer horizons, especially when it comes to pale ales and strong hoppy flavors. What do you recommend?

EDIT: the mix-a-six at my Kroger today had both Founder's all day ipa (which wasn't the best) and Harpoon ipa (which is pretty good). Thanks for the suggestions, y'all! I hope the health food store is open the next time I want a mix-a-six, because I know their selection is better.

EDIT 2: I also got some gumballhead, which is a good beer for those in my situation, who love wheat beer and want to learn to like hoppy beers. It's a good middle ground. 




 Yeah, my hometown's population is less than 4k. And a lot of my friends are from even smaller towns. 




 I've come to the realization that I am a boring individual. I have no hobbies, I don't branch out, and I'm sad most of the time.

I go to class, then I sit and watch Netflix and get drunk until I go to bed. Due to injuries, there are very few physical activities I can do without immense pain, and the only other things I do for fun (crochet, baking) are entirely solo.

I've been dating around, looking for someone I have anything in common with, and simply haven't been able to. I thought it was because I hadn't found anyone I'm really interested in, but that's not it. It's because I have nothing to have in common with someone.

TL; DR: I'm boring, and I don't know how to change it.

EDIT: Thank you all for your comments. Unfortunately, I just started Christmas break, but you all have helped me think that maybe I should just go do things. 




 Hello all!

I've been invited to a holiday party for the office where I worked for a year. I quit in August, because I was too busy to continue working there, but I still think I should make an appearance, because I loved the job and it gave me so many connections.

As background, the office was on my college campus, and focuses on educating the public about Congress. My boss was a former Congressman. The party is for every faculty and staff member in the department, which include my former Congressman boss and a former Senator from my state.

While I've been told by several people that faculty parties are generally not super fancy, I believe that this one is a bit different. In the year I worked there, I never saw a man out of a suit and woman in anything other than business. My office was business casual, but I was usually the least well-dressed person there, even in pencil skirts and cardigans. 

I recently slipped on the ice and dislocated my knee, and am finally off crutches, but I don't think that I can handle anything other than sneakers or snow boots. However, I think I'd be able to switch into nicer shoes for the small amount of time I'll be there, and I've also got a pair of nice black, flat oxfords that would be acceptable. It is from 3:30-5:30, but I'll have to leave by 4:30 to get to a final.

I have a few ideas as to what to wear. I've got a deep purple velvet dress, which I usually put with mustard tights and brown heels, as well as a huge number of different colored pencil skirts, which I'd pair with a nice white button-down. Any advice you could give me would be very much appreciated. I'm broke, so I can't buy anything new, but I have a few things fancier than what I usually wore to the office.

TL;DR: Holiday party tomorrow from 3:30-5:30pm, for faculty and staff of a school in which I worked in an office for a year. I would assume business casual to semi-formal, except to attendees will be a former Congressman and a former Senator. HALP! 




 I made my dresses both years, so they are just sitting in closets at home. Since they were made to fit me perfectly, I didn't even think about donating them. Junior year, I didn't even get it finished, and had to sew it closed onto my body. 




 Lost mine, but omg it was the cutest lighter ever.

I hardly go on /r/trees anymore, because it's so filled with boys (not men) and posts that just don't interest me much, but this post came up on my front page yesterday, and it got me thinking. I've pretty much only had dates recently from dating sites, because I'm too awkward to actually ask people out in person (unless I'm high, and I don't like being high in public). My profile talks about Mary Jane, because it's a big deal in my life, and I usually only respond to people who also talk about it, or at least have answered questions by saying that they smoke. 

Do you ladies look for men who smoke? I often do, like I said, but that is far from enough to make me want to be with them as anything but smoking buddies. Also, have you ever experienced being "put on a pedestal?" I have some female friends who talk a lot about how they get to smoke for free most of the time, and that they have joined a group of men smoking a bowl, just because they wanted company (this was mainly true when all my friends and I lived in a dorm and we had a smoking area for cigarettes that most of us used to smoke weed), and have been passed the bowl without asking and after having said that they were just out of a cigarette or company and weren't trying to be smoked out.

TL;DR: Do you specifically look for men who smoke when trying to find someone to date? Have you ever experienced being "put on a pedestal" for being an girl who smokes? 




 Thanks! It wasn't due after break, I just worked a lot on it. It's for an incomplete I got last fall, and I have until the end of the semester to submit it. I'll say that it'll be pretty dense, but if you're willing to proof a comparative analysis of worldwide campaign finance, I would appreciate it!

EDIT: The piece is named Godric, for obvious (to me) reasons. I usually smoke rolled things, but I ran out of papes and this bowl holds about the same amount as the spliffs I roll. 




 While it doesn't look as good as it could, it tastes amazing and buttery and eggy, as brioche should. If anyone's wondering, the recipe is from "The Roux Brothers on Patisserie." A lot of the other recipes aren't great, and with this one I still add a bit of nutmeg and a tiny bit more sugar, but I love the book simply for the amazing food porn. 




 Thanks. I wish I had a baking sheet big enough to not have to shape the braid into a circle, but it still tastes amazing. 




 It's the tiniest bit overdone, but not burned at all. My recipe calls for double eggwash, and this was my first time making a double batch. Not the prettiest, but still tastes amazing, as brioche should. 









 I've been dying my hair with henna for seven years now. It is permanent, and conditions your hair/makes it shiny. I do it myself and buy the powder in bulk at the health food store, so idk about doing it at a salon. Just make sure you use pure henna and do a strand test. Some heavy metals in some brands react really badly with dyed hair. Like, melt your hair off bad. 









 My cold sad outfit is wool leggings, wool socks, and a baseball-style top I cut to be off the shoulder from the golf team from my sophomore year of high school.

Warm sad/hungover days are Paris boxers and some random tank top.

When I want to go out and feel really sexy, I have this royal blue pencil skirt that my friends and I call "the skirt," because I have literally never worn it and not been hit on hard. 




 Not exactly what you're asking, but I usually layer a few pairs of tights for warmth and opacity. 




 Everyone in my family asks for my chocolate chip cookie recipe. Making grandma-level cookies at 21 is one of the things I love bragging about. 




 is just a big ol' mess of nut drunk not drunk not drunk not drunk not drunk HOLY SHIT NOW I'M REALLY FUCKING DRUNK.

EDIT: Omg, I love not having class after noon of Mondays and Wednesdays. 




 Thank you! 




 Thank you! While I don't have any experience with retail, I have been called the Queen of Organization, and I at least think I know my stuff. 




 Thanks! Like I said, I dropped my resume off in July, right after they had done a bunch of hiring. They only called me back last week. 




 Thank you! I think I know my stuff, I've been going to this same shop for three years now, and sometimes get frustrated when the workers can't find something simple. 




 I agree so much, I hate more than anything when the head shop people can't find a simple brand of papes when it's right there. Last year the shop had an influx of hot, brainless female employees, recently they've been better. I don't think I'll fall into that. 




 Hello all! I usually just lurk and comment 'round these parts, but I have a question that I think you ladies will be able to answer better than /r/femalefashionadvice , even though this is usually their territory.

As the title says, I have a job interview at my head shop tomorrow morning, and I am at a complete loss as to what to wear. I know for regular interviews you want business casual, or at least nicer clothes. But the head shop is so different from every other employer I've had, and I want to work there so so badly. The people working are pretty strictly jeans and t-shirt, but I want to make an impression that doesn't scream "she's trying too hard." Even though they dress so casually, I'm still thinking nicer pants (because all my jeans are torn up/worn out) or a casual skirt + tights (because it'll be below freezing when I need to be there) and a t-shirt (probably a Slytherin one I have because it's my absolute favorite and I feel so wonderful in it), but I'm not sure if even that's too casual.

Thank you in advance, I know you ladies know how to help another entwife in need.

EDIT: I'm also meeting the owner (whom I've never met, even though the employees know me by name and know exactly what type of papes I want), and the interview is at 8:30am (not at all hard for me to be awake for).

tl;dr: I've got an interview at my local head shop tomorrow and I have no idea what to wear. HALP! Please.

EDIT 2: Thank you so much for the help, everyone. I had the interview this morning, ended up in the black pencil skirt + black tights + Slytherin t-shirt, and I think it went really well. If anything, I showed how punctual I am, because I was there 5 minutes before the interviewer. 




 Commenting to save this pattern. I usually hate amigurumis for some reason (possibly because I already own way too many stuffed animals for a 21-year-old), but this hits right in the childhood. 




 I have a beautiful coral eyeshadow that is sadly not very pigmented. However, it's perfect for dabbing on over concealer, under foundation. Kinda cancels out the purple blue (mine are a little green cause I'm really warm toned). 




 Hopefully you'll find a coat with long enough sleeves! I'm just here to say that long wrist warmers under mittens are wonderful for that awkward uncovered wrist. 




 My birthday is on the 28th, and my best friend's is Nov. 2. Birthday Halloweek has been a thing for us. This year we're 21, so it's basically just an excuse to dress up, get wasted, and eat our body weights in chocolate all week without any judgement. 




 Slutty Teddy Roosevelt. Don't have an SO, which is ok, because I don't think anyone will be able to outdo Slutty Teddy Roosevelt.

Part of the reason that's my costume is simply because I believe that the words "Slutty Teddy Roosevelt" should be said together as many times as possible. 




 Rimmel Lasting Finish lipstick in Pink Blush. I describe it as my baby prostitute lipstick, cuz that's what I feel like when I put it on. I always try it again every few months, and it's always just awful.

I generally feel like a baby prostitute if I try any pink lipstick, though. I'm sticking to red or bare from now on. 




 I really only have one pair of sneakers that I can wear. Since I'll have to walk to the venue and have really bad knees, cute shoes are pretty much never an option, sadly. 




 I'm going on a second date with a guy I really like tomorrow. We're going to a comedy show at night. What do I wear?

For background, I wore a white skirt, grey tights, a grey sweater, and a pink scarf for our first (coffee turned into early dinner) date, and am thinking pants for this one because it will be cold. I've got most of the basics, and I absolutely love cardigans. Would skinny jeans+cute printed t-shirt+cardigan be too casual? 




 I've gone through two pairs of 5fingers and I love them so much. I had a grey/bright blue pair that I wore nearly every day for three summers, and a grey/strange army-ish green pair that is nearing the end. 

I'm generally less concerned with how my feet look because (due to years joint damage) if I do, my knees/hips/back hurt badly enough to not get out of bed for a few days afterwards. However, I just treated my vibrams like any other shoe. The green pair works really well with all the earth tones I wear, and I think all black Mary Jane-style ones are some of the cutest things ever. They really don't look much different from other black shoes, and if someone is seriously disturbed by them, they need to figure out why feet are so "gross." 




 (Partially to deal with the oh-so tacky see-through leggings) I always wear two pairs of leggings, which usually makes them much warmer! 




 I'm not a vegetarian, but I often cook big dinners with my friends, many of whom are.

My favorite non-meat protein sources are edamame (green soybeans) and the combination of peas and pasta (together they make a complete protein.) Edamame is great because you can put some frozen beans in tupperware and they'll be thawed and the perfect temperature by lunch. 




 Don't worry /u/vickivoracious I wasn't offended. 




 Actually it's glass. Hooray for shower ledges! 




 Girls are, in fact, on the internet. 




 I made it a little too strong, and I love the triple bitterness. 




 I wanted a picture of it, but didn't want to risk getting my phone wet. Be assured, it was drunk in the shower. 




 It takes the refreshing part of showers added to the refreshing part of drinks. 




 Shower Gin and Tonic is even more refreshing! 




 You got it! 




 The gin was brown. Would have preferred the clear kind, but lack of funds means you gotta go with plastic bottle Seagrams. 









 "A rebellion is always legal in the first person, such as 'our rebellion.' It is only in the third person -- 'their rebellion' -- that it becomes illegal."

 I love taking a long hot shower during the comedown of LSD and MDMA. 

I'm a little afraid to try it in my new apartment because the water doesn't get very hot and sometimes I'm a little bitch when it comes to lukewarm showers. 




 I'm going as slutty Teddy Roosevelt. Because. 




 saving and commenting for number 4 




 Maybe it was just me, but when I was getting drug tested I got pee on my hands every time, and it was my own pee. So getting some on your hands won't be an issue. Just say you aren't used to trying to aim. 




 That's what I'm reading! 




 Mixing another drink every time you need a break from Plato is a great way to get wasted on a weeknight. 




 Perfectly describes me. Also, I mainly go on dates with guys who smoke anyway, so it works out. All ents smoke before going out to eat. I usually have a spliff rolled up for when we meet, then we'll walk to wherever we're going. 




 And what about difficult last names? Mine only has two syllables, but I get people assuming it's one all the time. 




 If the password for "Sit on my face" isn't "and tell me that you love me," I would be very upset. 




 My ex boyfriend not only continued to use my parents' account after we broke up, but (at least I'm pretty sure) then changed the password himself so none of us could. Luckily, we were able to completely reset the account after my dad couldn't sign on one day.

He also didn't sign out of my friend's account on his Xbox until he invited her over and she saw him using it.

You don't even want to know how insane this boy is. 




 Down in btown we've been getting medicinal from Michigan and Cali (believe it or not) for a while now. No one I know has any idea where to even try to find mids.

 I don't forsee a democratic governor in my lifetime. Moving the hell out of this state as soon as humanly possible. 




 I've never understood how calling me independent is supposed to be an insult. 




 1) seriously, go to class.

2) take anything and everything that seems interesting, at least at first, to find something you're really passionate about. I'm a junior picking up Arabic because I like languages.

3) read for class and do your homework. 

4) learn to take good notes. This means (at least for me) outline style, with the main points copied from the PowerPoint and subheadings from discussion.

5) no matter how dumb you think you might sound, speak up in class. This is especially important in language classes, because it allows your professor to help you with pronunciation and grammar.

6) eat dinner at Collins. Or just go to Collins as often as possible. But I'm biased on that front (lived there for two years).

7) take a class with Aurelian Craiutu. Seriously, this guy is the best there is. He's Political Science, but teaches other classes, too. He will challenge you and won't accept bullshit. I took Modern Political Thought with him last semester and am taking Classical in the fall (Y382   381, respectively), but he also does a class on happiness that I want to take so badly.

8) don't commit dormcest. It WILL be awkward.

9) your UD advisor is going to be shitty, no matter what. Deal with it, cuz you won't need him/her for long.

10) DON'T. EVER. SMOKE. WEED. IN. YOUR. DORM. ROOM. EVEREVEREVEREVER.

Edit: 11) get a job at some point, even if it's just for a summer. You don't want to graduate with a four-year-old resume, or worse, no resume at all. 
























 I know I'm a bit late, but I just need to rave about a store I found I couple weeks ago when I was traveling for my sister's hooding (also congrats to her for being almost done with her Ph.D!!) Sorry in advance for the book.

There's this show store in Berkeley, California called The Walk Shop. Their motto is "shoes for people who walk." The entire point is shoes that are comfortable. 

I did ballet for 9 years. I'm 21 years old, and have legitimate arthritis in my knees and I don't remember the last time one or both of my ankles hasn't hurt, sometimes to the point that I ha e to take a sick day for it because I literally can't walk.

I got these ( http://www.imgur.com/fVilOdH.jpeg) for her commencement, and I have literally never had more comfortable shoes. And they're cute as heck, at least to me. They're Cobb Hill brand, and have changed my life. I didn't realize that shoes could be cute AND make me not want to cut off my legs after a full day on my feet.

/rave, anyone in that area should def look this place up. A lot of their stuff is not the most stylish, but I saw a huge amount of cute things that felt just amazing. 




 I was lucky in that I made my dresses both years. Senior year, I made a gorgeous backless mermaid dress. But you're right; unless you know exactly what works, you'll probably look strange.

EDIT: I was also maaaaybe 110 pounds at that point. So, yeah. 160 pound me now would look terrible in it, and probably anything like it, even if I made it myself to my exact measurements. 




 Grrl. I know it's frowned upon, but I wear leggings as pants all the time. I just make sure to wear at least two pairs at a time, to make sure they aren't see through. I wear regular tops with them, and think "red hair don't care" about everyone who tries to tell me it looks bad. 




 I just finished COLL-C105, Quantum Mysteries for Everyone as my breadth of inquiry class. If you've taken any physics class ever, it's too easy to explain. But I spent half of high school assuming I'd be a physics major, before switching to political science after 3 weeks, haha.

I've also heard people say POLS-Y105, intro to political theory, is a gen ed (idk, I'm a poli sci major), and I also just finished it and it was awesome. A lot of reading, but amazing. However, I'd say to wait until Prof. Craiutu is back from his sabbatical. I took his classes 3 semesters in a row, and I feel bad for anyone taking any political theory class that isn't taught by him.

My knowledge is mainly in the poli sci department, but I will say DO NOT take POLS-Y103, intro to comparative politics, or really any comparative politics classes, unless you absolutely have to. 

Sorry if you're in the majority that doesn't like politics at all, that's just the experience I have.

Tl;dr: if you can wait a year or so to get your gen ed out of the way, take POLS-Y105, when Prof. Craiutu is teaching it, but be prepared to read a lot. 




 Peplums look bad on everyone. No matter what. 




 Yeah. Like, I've had some guys who tell me I can give out their digits no matter what, but I still ask them beforehand, and will only do it for close friends. Common courtesy to me, they are providing an illegal service. 




 There's also the issue of your dealer's dealer. My old weed dealer's dealer was also involved in coke, and my guy got fucked because an undercover officer was assigned to scope out the coke.

Even if you only do an ounce at a time, you have to realize that you're probably going somewhere with pounds fairly often. A friend was dating my guy's guy for a while, and I remember being so nervous when he went to roll a blunt and asked me which of his two strains I wanted to smoke, pulling out 2 pounds. 




 Everyone has that one bad tequila story, man. For me, it only happens when I mix it. When I want to drink tequila, I can't drink anyrhing else. Dark and lights, hard and soft, every other combination is okay with me, but tequila + any other alcohol = immediate bad time. 




 Hate this phrase, but I can't even. Too much stupid for my brain to handle. 




 I've just lived here too long. I think everyone has some beef with their home town. 




 Sometimes? I'm from Btown (one of the few almost civilized parts) and I'm literally always ashamed. 




 Valpo is a special place. Like the rest of Indiana. 




 I think you might have just posted the best thing I will ever read. 




 My baby Kate was the runt, too, and she's so rambunctious.  




 Our cat at home gets an old hamper with pillows and an electric blanket amd a heating pad for if it gets really cold on the porch. He likes it. 




 Not sure if it's the Asian ones that squirt some foul smelling something or other, but I'm super allergic to that shit and makes me hate the little nuggets. 




 Like the title says, I'm flying from Indiana to California tomorrow morning for my sister's hooding. I searched, but I couldn't find anything about this specifically. 

I have a metal lunchbox in which I keep my makeup. I know to bag the foundation, concealer, and mascara, but is that all? I'll put my shampoo and conditioner in empty pill bottles, but can I still put the metal box in my carry-on? I won't be able to check anything, because my family is already paying a lot for the stay, so any help will be great. 

Does lipstick count as a gel? What about a marker type eyeliner? I really don't know anything about this. 




 Thanks for making me remember all my favorite songs from Freshman year of high school are actually about heroin.  




 Exactly! I've never been to Japan or anything like it, but the two are very different. A bath is to relax, a shower is to get clean. 




 Hello all!

In this week of super stress, I like to make two of my most comforting foods: fried dough and curry.

http://www.imgur.com/ithjHq5.jpeg
Here are the hush puppies. 

1 box Jiffy mix
2 eggs
~1/2-3/4 cup each corn and diced onion (I used frozen because it's what I had)
Vegetable oil to fry
Salt, red pepper flake, and garlic powder to taste

Mix together all the ingredients in a bowl.
Heat about 1/4 inch of oil in a skillet. I don't have a thermometer, but most recipes say 350 is what you want.
Drop small spoonfuls of the corn mix into the oil, fry until golden brown, flip, and transfer to a plate with paper towels. I found that these cooked up really fast, maybe a minute on one side and 30 seconds on the other.
Add salt, pepper, whatever (I really wanted Old Bay, but didn't have any) while they're still hot.

I think if I could have actually deep fried these, they would have been more like hush puppies. Really they were more like fried cornbread blobs, but they were still delicious. 

http://www.imgur.com/P4Tah1S.jpeg
And this is roasted cauliflower and carrot curry. This I didn't measure at all, so I'll guesstimate. It ended up with about three servings.

The veggies:
1 cup each frozen cauliflower florets and sliced carrots (again, frozen is all I have right now)
2 tbl curry powder
Salt to taste
~1 tbl vegetable oil, to drizzle on top

Spread the veggies evenly on a baking dish
Sprinkle curry powder and salt on top, mix to coat
Drizzle oil on top
Roast in a 425 oven for 25 minutes

The rice/sauce:
1 cup rice (before cooking) + water to cover one inch above
1/4 stick butter
Flour (sorry, I have no idea how much)
~1/4 cup curry powder
Water
Salt and red pepper flake to taste

Cook the rice as directed (I did it in the microwave because I'm lazy and made this at 5am)
In a saucepan, melt the butter. Add the flour and make a roux (continue stirring until it creates a paste).
Add more curry powder and water to make it more saucy.
Add the vegetables and cooked rice into the sauce, mix well, add salt/pepper/whatever to taste.

I wish I had had coconut milk or chicken stock for this, but I was just using what I had.

For some reason, these are two of my favorite comfort foods. I'm broke as a joke, so I didn't have the options I usually would. However, they still turned out pretty well. Adapt, adopt, and improve. 




 Beautiful, and I LOVE the name. 




 I have a friend who takes forever to order and likes to make her own thing. We went to one of the student bars on a busy night one time and she spent 15 minutes going back and forth with things like "I want something chocolatey," "oooh, raspberry or strawberry vodka," "what would go well with that," etc. The bartender had to leave to treat the regulars, and she ended up with something like "two shots of Bailey's, half a shot of raspberry vodka, some chocolate liqueur, and the rest with tonic water." I felt so bad, I just got a rum and coke.

I'm guessing most bartenders would be happy to serve you anything normal, so long as you know what you want before you bother them. 




 I failed two classes this semester. I've been too sad to go to class, so the ones that take attendance failed me. They were both major classes.

I drink too much. I know I do, and I know it's a problem. But drunk is pretty much the only time I don't feel miserable.

I graduated high school 6th in my class. My gpa was 3.86. I was depressed, but it came so easily to me. Now, after my third year of college, I'll be lucky to have a 2.3. 

I just haven't cared all semester, and now I feel like a complete failure. I'm afraid to see my family. My sister is about to get her Ph.D. from one of the best schools in the country. My dad has one in physics, and recently got sober.

I can't even work up the energy to cry. I'm broke, so I can't even buy booze to make myself feel better. Even my cats don't make me feel any better about myself.

I've gained a bunch of weight, I haven't showered in a week, and I never see any friends. I still have two more finals and I don't care, but I know I need to step it up if I want to not fail all of my classes.

It's getting time where I have to start worrying about getting jobs. I'm gonna have to take a victory lap, which my parents are fine with, but I may even need two. I'm going part time next semester, for sure, but I have no idea what I'm going to do with my life. I've always dreamed of working in the government, but I'm so far from the cream of the crop that I'm that rejected corn that gives livestock mad cow. I had to drop my French major, which means my fallback of becoming a French teacher isn't even a possibility anymore.

I've wanted to do the Peace Corps for forever, but I doubt I can bring my cats with me to Africa, and I doubt even more that I can go two years without them. On top of that, they wouldn't accept me with my grades.

Tl;dr: I failed my first two classes ever this semester, I feel like a failure, and I have no idea what I'm going to do with my life. All I wanna do is cry, and I can't even do that. 




 I'm not sure what the trail is, but there's a nice wooden deck thing looking over a lake at Leonard Springs that's only a 10-15 minute walk from the parking lot 




 I see you aren't hunting. You must be very hungry. Here, I give you foodz 




 I'll just say right quick that time out was effective for me as a kid because it was specifically the same place where I got spanked if I was really bad. My mom would make my sister and I sit at the base if the stairs, by the kitchen where she could watch us. 




 On btownmenus. I know I needed it after this "dead"week.

 Not op, but I'm guessing it's just a normal crust, custard, and fruit on top. 




 They're not, I got the ginger so the other would have a friend. They play fight fairly often, but are also snuggly and give each other baths. 




 The grey/white since August, the ginger since February. They're both a little over a year old. 









 Fun fact, I originally heard of this line back when she was the singer of Sky Salt (still one of my favorite bands). It's sad that they broke up and she turned dramariffic. 




 I pride myself on my croissants, and a curry butternut squash risotto is my ultimate comfort food.  




 I've only made pasta a handful of times, but I always found that just making a pile of noodles when they're wet and letting them dry that way always worked. It kinda looks like ramen. 




 Late, but Breckenridge Agave Wheat. Simply amazing. 




 Honestly, DSOTM is my least favorite. Momentary Lapse of Reason and Piper at the Gates of Dawn are the best, in my opinion. And PF songs were my lullabies every night growing up.

And of course Wish You Were Here. 




 My father and I both make a point to only listen to this album twice a year, because it makes us both cry/rage/yell at everyone. Momentary Lapse of Reason forever. 




 Good for him! I'm glad he's been able to transition to what he feels is right. Hope all is going well for him. 




 So instead, I got two cats. And they're the loves of my life, but I will always be a dog person. I especially want a really big dog, the kind who would either need room to run around, or multiple 3-mile walks every day, and I'm lucky if I walk a mil every day, haha. 




 I recently quit smoking weed. I don't remember the last time I was this anxious. 

I wake up multiple times a night after having falling nightmares. I've been dreaming otherwise about a man who emotionally abused me. 

I get drunk all day, every day. I don't remember the last day I didn't get drunk. I get the shakes every morning, and I don't feel normal unless I'm drunk.

About a month ago, my dad finally went into alcohol rehab. He's now in an Intensive Outpatient Program for it. 

When I was six, I remember him teaching me that a certain hand gesture meant "go get me another beer." And I'm turning into him.

The last time I went without booze for 3 days, I had to talk myself down from cutting or trying to kill myself multiple times a day. I hate that a handle lasts me two days; I hate that I need to bring a flask with me to class; I hate that I need to get drunk to spend time with my family; I hate that more than half of my money goes to booze. But most of all, I'm terrified of what could happen if I were to quit. 




 I couldn't put text in on my phone.

I've literally never done anything to my brows. Never plucked, never gotten them shaped, never filled them in--nothing. I know they could be better, although I've gotten compliments on them before

What should I do? I just bought my first pair of tweezers, but I'm scared of over-plucking.

Also excuse the early morning, no makeup face.

EDIT: here's a side view http://www.imgur.com/VaBMLfm.jpeg

EDIT 2: I don't want to go get it done professionally, I don't have anywhere near me besides a threading place that is notorious for making brows way too thin. And I really enjoy doing things myself.  









 Bassetts are my favorite ever. Wish I could support a dog right now, but can't.

OMG THOSE EARS DO 




 I just hope my other kitty won't get her cold, but I doubt it, cuz that's how germs work.  




 She got some meds yesterday, and she's been napping and sneezing today, but I'm soooooo happy she's feeling better. My cats are my children.  




 When she puked 5 times in one day when she only did once after eating food too fast, I was concerned. She seems to be doing better today, although she's been napping and sneezing a lot. 




 Obviously, after all that yakking and sneezing, I took her to the vet yesterday. Now we're 18 hours puke free and she got some antibiotics and antinausea medicine. She's been sleepy and has the sneezy wheezies, but I think she's well on her way. This was my first kitty illness, so I was freaking out all day yesterday, but she seems to be feeling much better already. 









 My kitties do this, but with immediate lap time, since they're too small for hugs. 




 I wanted to make a throwaway for this, but fuck it. I had a craigslist hookup once, and as soon as I saw his Nazi paraphernalia and a big Nazi chestpiece tattoo, I left. Like, this dude had a Nazi armband framed next to his copy of Mein Kampff. 

Skinheads are sometimes punks, but not all punks are skinheads.  




 I didn't even notice this. /r/gonewildstories exists for a reason, it's where I get most of my (lady) fapping material. 




 I want to become a high school French teacher, and this makes me sad. I mean, in my high school experience, most of the parents seemed awful (southern Indiana here), but I only hung out with kids whose mothers read to them all the time growing up.

I was also homeschooled 2nd-6th grade, because I was at a 5th grade reading level in 1st grade, so maybe my views are skewed. My dream job is secretary of education, to fix our fucked up system (our meaning the USA's). 




 This. I've stopped looking both ways before I cross the street because I honestly don't care if I were to get hit by a car, but I'm taking steps. 

I relapsed last week after 18 months, and the last time was when I attempted suicide. 

The first step is to try hard to be not miserable. While that is a far cry from happy, it can be liberating. Try to see the silver linings. I know myself well enough to know that I will never be a "glass half full" type of person, so I try to look for the silver linings. I slipped on the ice and dislocated my knee, but I got a legit knee brace put of it, which I've needed for years. 

We all know it's hard. It's harder than a lot of things. It's a legitimate addiction, but there's no self-harm anonymous. The most we can do is try. 

Try every day. Use a rubber band, call a friend, go play with kitties at the shelter, anything. And, most of all, know that there are people who care. You're free to PM me anytime. If need be, I'll give you my number so you have someone to call. 

I don't know you, but I care about you. You deserve to live. You deserve to feel better. You deserve to be (at least) not miserable.  




 That star trek blanket may be my favorite thing ever. 









 I've said this before, but I wish I could volunteer at the shelter. If I did, I'd end up adopting everyone, because I fall in love so quickly, haha.

My first kitty was originally a foster, and she stole my heart after I lived with her/fed her/took care of her for two months. She's a sweet, rambunctious, tiny salt and pepper tabby with a white underside. 




 This makes me feel bad now. When I went to adopt Guillaume, my second kitty, I went to his room first and he immediately climbed into my lap. He's a big orange moogie, which is my personal favorite type of kitty.

I did go to all the other rooms and fell in love with a couple others, but I wanted someone outgoing and around the same age as my first baby, Kate. 




 Yay for dog cats. My first one also loves to play fetch. 




 I'm gonna have to try these. I'm used to spending a lot of time on my baked goods (making croissants from scratch is my happy place). 




 But can I get TP with the same print? 




 And The West Wing's Donna 




 Haha, I apparently give great back massages with my feet (yay 9 years of ballet), but it still just seems weird to me that walking on someone to get them off. Massages, sure (with proper knowledge and support, cuz doing it wrong can seriously fuck up your back), but the whole getting off on it seems weird.

Also, like I said before, I'm only 21, so a 33 year old seems too old for me. He wanted a relationship, and I'm wanting to date people who are still in college or just out of college. 




 I would, but the only real room with a door in my apartment (in the bathroom) doesn't have a real closing mechanism. It has handles, but they're just handles on either side of a hole in the door. My closet has a real closing mechanism, but I'd feel awful locking anyone in the 3x5 foot space without a litter box. 




 Thanks! And sorry for the late reply. I used to feed Kate on top of the fridge, which helped, but they both like to hang out there, and I've had to pick up food and water off my kitchen floor several times, since they both have those bowls that hold food and water. 

I've been trying feeding them separately, but they're still stealing. It's been better, though, because they steal mutually now. They eat half a bowl of food, then they switch and eat the other's half. 




 Grapefruit juice and Gewuztraminer.  Really not a mimosa, but too good not to try. 




 I've got a friend who makes GnT's with cilantro all the time in the summer. Perfect! 









 Same here. A bank teller once told me that she was the mother of someone who went to my high school. A month later, I went back in with my mom, and she said the teller looked familiar. I immediately said "that's (this person)'s mom!" It took her by surprise, to say the least. 




 This is why I can't wait to live on a coast. I remember a summer I spent in Northern France, on the coast, and I went out in the morning, caught some crab, cooked them, and ate them all in around 4 hours. Anywhere in Indiana that claims to have "fresh" seafood is lying. 




 My mom wanted me to make brownies for my sister before she got her med card, haha. 




 Thank you, like everyone else has said.   My vet at home was a lot like you: caring, thoughtful, and wonderful. He understood when my whole family was there, bawling their eyes out, when we had to finally put the family dog down. He had arthritis, and we think diabetes, along with doggy Alzheimer's. He would forget to eat for days, then had seizures because his blood sugar was too low. 

You are a great person for feeling how hard it is to put down a pet. It's usually for their own good, because they simply can't understand the horrible things happening to them. My Buddha was 15 when we put him down, and I was only 16. He was my baby brother, and I still visit where we buried him fairly often. 

Again, thank you. I hope all vets are like you, and mine at home. 




 But thanks for the advice 




 The only real door I have is in my bathroom, where I feed the newbie. It doesn't have a real handle, and they can both get through any doorstop I put there.

By no real handle, I mean that you can pull it closed, but the handle is just a hole on both sides with the handle, but there is no actual closing mechanism.  




 I've searched and didn't find a good answer.

I brought a new cat into my home, and the two are getting along swimmingly. But, the newbie (Bill, around a year old, same as Kate, the original one) keeps stealing Kate's food. I still have the bowls in separate rooms, but once Bill finishes his food, he goes into the other room and eats most of Kate's. 

Is there any way I can keep him from doing this? I've taken him away when I catch him doing it, but he's much bigger than Kate, and I think he bullies her away from it.

Tl;dr: new cat eats old cat's food, and I want to make sure they're both eating enough. Worried about old cat's eating habits, since the newbie eats most of hers. 

EDIT: As background, Kate is an exceptionally small cat. She was even smaller than the normal runt of her litter. Bill is already fairly round, I call him "fatty Mcfatface" as a joke. Kate is fairly skinny, and I'm not sure if it's just because she has a small build,  or if it's because Bill steals her food. 




 No, but I'm only 21. That big of an age gap bugs me. I've got an older sister (26 next month), and it just seems weird to be with someone older than her. 19-24 is my comfort zone.  




 You may be the best SO ever. This looks so amazing. 




 Not an SO, but someone on okcupid sent me a message asking if I'd like to walk on him. I'd do it, but he was also 12 years my senior, and didn't seem compatible anyway. 









 Sadly, it's no longer on Netflix. I may try to track it down, but it is actually one of my favorite films. Set in something similar to WWII 




 I know the argument has been made many times that we shouldn't judge a girl on her size. Saying "a real man loves a girl with curves" is just as bad as saying "anything more than a handful is a waste."

I've gained 20 pounds in the last few months. I mean, I was considered "too thin" before that, but I have always been self conscious about how small my tits are. But even after gaining all that weight, due to stress, depression, and how much easier it is to order food than to cook for yourself, my tits are still less than one of my handfuls. And, for my whole life, I have been called "baby hands." I hate it. 

I feel fat, because I have a noticeable stomach pudge. I can't fit into a lot of the clothes I bought last fall, when I was put on medicine that I was told would make me gain weight. To put it into perspective, when I was put on that medicine, I was 5'8" and 112 pounds. When I felt healthy finally, I was at 125. I'm not was 145, and I was told at the doctor's that my blood pressure was higher than it should be.

I've been watching what I eat, I quit smoking so I could finally even make it to the gym without feeling like I had finally had a full workout.

But I hate so much the idea that "anything more than a handful is a waste." Even though I'm not fit, I feel fat as hell, my tits are still not a real person's handful.

Can we stop with this dichotomy of "real men prefer girls with curves" and "more than a handful is a waste?" It hurts, even for those of us who are on the smaller end of the spectrum. 




 This makes me sooo happy that I'll have my two cats (both 11-months old) for the next 10-20 years. I hope I'll have kids by then. 




 I want to go to mass. I want to go to confession. The ritual and the idea on confessing all the bad you've done seems really appealing to me. I'd never take communion, because I think it would be offensive to take the body and blood of something I don't believe in, but the structure, the moral directives, the forgiveness appeals to me so much.

I think of religion as something to make you be a good person. And if you need an invisible man in the sky to make you a good person, I am completely fine with it. I don't; I want to be a good person because the world has seen too much injustice, too much hate.

But the structure that church can give you seems great to me. 




 Thank you for this. It's been almost 2 years since I broke up with my first boyfriend, and I'm only now realizing the good things we had. He did a lot of these things for me, too. 




 Oatmeal is the only thing that does it for me. A small bowl, soaks up errythang 




 That's awful! I've used henna for the last 7-8 years and wanna change it up, but this terrifies me. 




 Sorry for the delay.

I got a mistic e-cig, and I can get 0% nicotine cartridges, so I may switch to them in a while.

Good to know it's working for your mom! 




 Mainly I'm noticing the cough I've had since August is starting to dissipate, haha. 




 I usually don't post in here, but I'm excited. I'M QUITTING SMOKING! After 2+ years. I'm only on day two, and I'm cheating a little by going the e-cig route, but I'm not a super bitch, and I'm already noticing a difference in my lung capacity.

EDIT: I know this doesn't have a question, so I guess if anyone has tips past the e-cig, I'd love it. I'm doing a bunch of crochet, and I hope to start exercising once I can walk to the gym without panting and wanting to die. 




 If you can deal with the incredible sweetness, I've done caramel appletinis with sour apple schnapps and caramel vodka. Suuuuuper sweet, bordering on too sweet, but still pretty good. 




 I'll keep that in mind next time. I like cold meatloaf sandwiches, so the loaf pan is great for that, but it does seem a little too fatty on top. 




 Is there really any way to make meatloaf look nice? It tastes amazing, and that's all that really matters. 




 So, I was dumb and didn't think about a recipe. Here's basically what I did.

2 pounds ground pork
1/2 cup garlic breadcrumbs
5-6 shiitake mushrooms, sliced
1/2-3/4 cup frozen pepper-onion blend from Kroger.
2 eggs
Hoisin and sriracha to cover.

Mix pork, breadcrumbs, and eggs together. Sweat onions and peppers, add mushrooms and saute until lightly wilted. Mix vegetables into the pork mixture. Put in loaf pan, and cover with hoisin sauce and sriracha. Bake for an hour, turn off oven and let sit inside for another ten minutes. Let sit for at least another ten minutes. 




 I've recently been into updating comfort food. It was very good. 




 Sorry! I basically followed http://m.allrecipes.com/recipe/14629/mushroom-meatloaf this, but with pork and hoisin instead of ketchup. 




 I didn't use a recipe, just based the ratios from a google search.

I've had the idea of a vaguely asian meatloaf for a while, and I always crave meatloaf when it's been cold for so long. 









 :-( I just dont understand the type of person who could do that. 




 I adopted a new cat on Friday. My first cat was a foster I fell in love with, but the second's story is so sad.

The shelter told me that he was brought in after someone's cat had kittens and couldn't handle them all. He was adopted once, and a week later, he was brought back in as a stray. His first adoptive owner never came for him when they called. 

He is seriously the sweetest cat I've ever met. He crawled into my lap immediately at the shelter, and spends most of his time there now.

I just don't understand at all how someone could give him up. He's so wonderful.

Does anyone else's cat have a sad past? 




 I hardly ever see people actually using that crosswalk. I do, but a lot of the time, people just cross wherever they want, including ten feet from the crosswalk. I'm of the opinion that, if you decide to drive on tenth, you need to factor in the traffic. Just leave earlier. 




 And they already shut down parts of 10th every summer. 




 The first thing I remember my dad teaching me was that a certain hand gesture meant "go get me another beer."

Let's just say alcoholism runs in the family. 




 Same. I doubt I could teach my cats this trick. 




 He's an 11-month old male, and seems to be very friendly and confident. I went to the shelter for their free feline friday, and he immediately came and sat on my lap. I just got him home, so he's been sniffing around the apartment.

I had a short introduction with my 10-month old, Catrine, and there was ne'er a hiss. I'm still gonna keep them generally seperate for a few days, but I'm gonna let him explore while I sequester Kate, switching them every few hours.

Guillaume is the French version of William, so I think I'll call him Bill for short. I think all ginger cats should be named after Weasleys. 









 Maybe I'm weird. Or it may be because I'm completely in love with my specific apartment, but I love them. 




 I don't know anything about those specific places, but I'm renting with PavProps and they're the best. The maintenance men come within 12 hours of putting in a request, they shovel/scrape the sidewalk for you, and, if you stay on their good side, they can be very nice. I'm planning on getting a second cat, and when I called, they said that they wouldn't charge me more pet rent.

My friends renting with Grant Properties say that that landlady is wonderful, too.

EDIT: Several of my friends live in the Lincoln Hill apartments (544 S. Lincoln) and they're really nice. I looked at a one-bedroom there, and it's very nice. And they allow up to 2 cats. But it may be a bit far from Kelley. 
























 That is very true. And I bet everyone who thinks they were raised well will find things wrong with the way other people were raised. I guess it's just the apparent reliance on technology that scares me. I feel that I was raised very well, and hope to raise my future children the same way, but I think it's pretty hard to royally screw up a child, so long as you still treat them like a human being. 




 Up vote for cats with human names. Mine are Kate and Bill, next girl (unless a ginger, who will be named after one of the Weasley ladies) will be Tallulah, three L's and an H. 




 We've had our fair share of ferals back home, he looks like he can take care of himself. Hopefully he can get into a TNR program, but he looks like he's seen some shit. 




 At older ages, it's ok, but I've seen many people hand an iPad to their two year old because they didn't want to deal with actual parenting.

Then again, I may be old school. I wasn't allowed to play video games at all growing up (I played Mario kart for the first time when I was 18), and that probably skewed my views. If I ever uttered the words "I'm bored," I was immediately put to work cleaning or working in the garden. Hell, I spent every summer from age 7 to 15 at a garden camp, and it was amazing until I was put in a junior counselor position (for some reason, everyone assumes girls love small children, who I happen to hate more than most things). 




 I'm terrified when I see parents these days just give their kids a smartphone to be entertained. I ran around in the yard, wrestled with the dogs, read books, asked my dad if I could help cook, and did all sorts of fun things that stimulated me more than candy crush ever could.

Then again, I was homeschooled 2nd-6th grade, and did ballet, so there was always a science project or a new step to practice, too. 




 Idk about German, but gendered nouns often don't make any sense. In French, the word for vagina is masculine. 




 Wine glasses, IME, are just for breaking on your kitchen floor. Lost my last one a month ago, and my vacuum is so shitty that I still get to pick pieces of broken glass out of my feet afye lunch every day. 




 That glass thing hasn't had an atm for at least a year. 




 In my experience, old animals know when it's time and will wander, as if to keep the ones who love them from seeing the body. We had a Cocker Spaniel growing up, and right around his 17th birthday, he just wandered off and we never saw him again. That was actually a lot easier for me (I was 13/14) than when we put down our other dog when I was 16. Cody the spaniel was my sister's dog, Buddha was my baby brother (he was only a year younger than me).

I already get very sad thinking about the day I will need to put my cats down, but they are both young still. 




 I've been wanting to get friends to go to brunch, cuz there's a place in town that has cheap mimosa pitchers, but no one is awake. 




 I've only met a couple niche celebrities (Julie Kent would occasionally visit my ballet studio growing up, a family friend has juggled for Cirque de Soleil, and anyone who grows up in Bloomington, Indiana has at least seen John Mellencamp [ps, he's a jerk]), but even those I've had a hard time keeping it together.

It's good to hear about famous people acting like what they are -- regular people who happen to be famous. And good on you for treating him as that, besides the photo op that must get annoying. 




 There's this store in San Francisco that literally only has infused oils, vinegar, and spices. I got a bottle of salad dressing that was lemon evoo and chili-fig balsamic last time I was out there. One of the best things I've ever tasted. 




 I went with Dead Poets Society, which if course made me sob anyway, but his first scene. "We are food for worms, lads. One day, we are all going to stop breathing, turn cold, and die." That bluntness has helped me through the hard times, oddly. 




 He may go to a new home at some point, because my dad is allergic and barely tolerates the one who adopted us several years ago, but I hope this little Nugget can stay around. I'd take him in, but my landlord is already iffy about me having two. 




 Thanks do the quick reply! I will probably just go to the drugstore to get a cheap pair of nylons for stuffing, cuz I want it to be overstuffed, and will be using scrap yarn, so will probably need to use dc or hdc to make sure I have enough. 









 I've decided to take a short break from my frantic afghan making (3.5 left to do before Xmas, at least two before graduation in May) to make myself a foot cushion.

I have terrible knees and ankles (seeing an orthopedist in a month or so to find out what's really wrong), and when I spend a day working on a project, it's those joints that hurt more than my wrists.

I'm just gonna wing the pattern, but I've never made anything stuffed before. Do I need to make sure that the stitch are especially tight so the filling won't leak out? Could I stuff it in some pantyhose and then into the pillow? One of my cats is notorious for ripping the stuffing out of any toy and trying to eat it, so I'd like to find a way to minimize that.

TL;DR: making my first stuffed object, how can I make sure the stuffing will stay inside? 




 This is terrifying! I finally finished a blanket for a friend that was supposed to be done for graduation (early May), so I'm gonna have to ship it from Indiana to Seattle/Tacoma when she moves out there in a week or so, and I was planning on using one of those USPS flat rate boxes. I guess I'll wait to buy the yarn for my next project so I can ship it with UPS or FedEx and feel more secure. 




 Is there any type of shelter? My town has a battered women's shelter,  and every year I use my Christmas scraps to make hats and scarves do the kids who live there.

Many animal shelters will also accept blankets and cat baskets. Look up the snuggles project. 




 I understand this in posts where you can't see the whole project. Recent posts that just show a baby or pet wrapped up in a blanket so you can't see what the FO looks like annoy me, but afghans or other projects that happen to have a cat in the picture are fine. For my last post, I couldn't keep my kitty off the blanket, and used her to show the scale. 




 Imma add this to my many reasons to move to Andorra. 




 Bobby pins don't do jack in my hair, but I buy them all the time. 




 I'd take it as a compliment, but I'm a very strange young woman. I pride myself on the fact that I'm a 21-year-old grandma (my chocolate chip cookies have been grandma level since I was 14), and grandmas are awesome (except that awkwardly racist one that some people have).

You have a skill that is becoming lost among the younger generations, so you're keeping a great craft alive. 




 I'd ask her. Burgundy is gorgeous, but isn't really maroon. Unless it's a surprise, maybe you could try to take her shopping with you. Or your uncle, or someone who knows her taste well. I took my mom with me to make sure the colors for my sister's afghan would be nice.

EDIT: and I plan on asking my sister for advice for my mom's.  




 Late to the game, but this organization was recommended by a person in the stitch n bitch I'm starting on my campus once classes start. If I weren't trying to cram three and a half afghans by Christmas, I'd join in as well. 




 I just finished every season of HIMYM that's on Netflix. Thankfully I had already seen the end, else I'd have to find it elsewhere online.

Afhghans and Netflix are perfect for each other. 




 I'm gonna head over to the liquor store when I can work up the heart to move the napping cat in my lap. 




 How can you get striping tape to stick like that? I've only tried once, with a liberal application of top coat, but the tape peeled off in 45 minutes.  




 My ghetto apartment doesn't even have a roll, so it has to go on the awkwardly covered radiator next to the toilet.

And somehow I'm happy living here for three years. 




 I strictly follow the 2:1 ratio, but I've heard other people say that simply cover in the rice with an inch of water also works. A lot of recipes say not to peek, ever, but it really isn't that finicky. 

Try making it a few times in small batches and it'll become second nature. 




 Cooking rice on the stove has some big scary stigma, but I do it at least weekly, and it's done by the time I brush my teeth, wash my face, and get ready. Fluff, put it in the fridge, fried rice for dinner every night. 




 Perfect brioche take 8 hours, minimum, and if you can master a 4-strand braided circle, you will win at life (or so I've been told when I do this).  My recipe is from a book called "The Roux Brothers on Patisserie," although I will always add a pinch or two of nutmeg.

Home made croissants are also impressive, and take more than 8 hours to make properly. And once you learn how to make that dough, you can make pain au chocolat, or beautiful fruit turnovers, or pretty much anything that requires puff pastry. I'm a girl, so I can vouch that saying "yeah, I made this from scratch" will get me wet, when it comes to puff pastry.  




 I used two strands throughout.

Basic pattern:

Chain 32 with two strands of the starting color (in this case, green or white)

Dc 14 rows

Tie off one of the strands and switch to the other color.

Dc 14 rows. 

Repeat.

Make the same strips, starting with a solid of the other color, sew then together.

This one is throw sized, shown on a couch with a very small kitty (Kate is only around 7 pounds,  even though she's almost 16 months old, just like my other baby, Bill). 









 This is why I always keep the lid down. Otherwise the cats wouldn't drink any other water, and my apartment is ghetto enough for the toilet to inly flush half the time. 




 And doing that thing cats do where they repeatedly poke your face the second you start stirring at all. Assholes. Adorable, lovable assholes. 




 I usually carry my groceries back in my backpack, and they both jump in the second it's opened. 




 That happened to me even during Freshman year of college, when I was blessed with never having hangovers. Now I just make sure to get a water after every drink or two, or chase with water if I make the (always horrible, terrible, no good, very bad) life choice to take shots. 




 Drunk me left a pair of glasses at a rando's house. 




 Sugar pie baby cat/ you know I love you/ I can't help myself/ I just love to snuggle you. 




 I won't have a projector or anything, but I carry my laptop with me to class anyway, so that would probably help. 




 That is a great idea! Last night, I just realized that I don't really know how to explain these things because they're second nature to me now. Maybe I could even show some of these videos from my laptop, since it will be after class anyway. 




 These aren't really classes, more getting people together to work on a common hobby. Some people have just expressed an interest in learning. It will be taking place in a lounge in the dorm where I used to live, and many people seem to be especially interested in philanthropic projects (hats for kids at the local battered women's shelter, project linus, etc). Some people already know how, and some will also be knitting (which is not my forte at all), so I may have some help there. 




 I don't go to mine often, just because I need to spend money on food more than nice yarn, but I know most of the women who work there are bistitchual.  I'll probably go there tomorrow, since I've got some things to do in town, anyway. 




 Maybe next time I go to the yarn store, I can ask the ladies there how they teach. Most of them are knitters, though. I'm not against knitting, I just vastly prefer crochet. 




 So, I've decided to start a stitch n bitch group on my campus in the fall, and have said that I will teach people the basic stitches (ch, sc, dc, etc.), but just realized that I'm not sure how to go about that.

I know I will start with simple projects, like scarves, wrist warmers, and hats in the round after a while, but I'm not sure how to describe how one does the simple stitches. I know I get confused reading patterns, and I've been crocheting for over a decade. 

Without saying things like "insert hook, yarn over, pull through, yarn over, pull through both loops," how would you describe a sc? I'm guessing these people to be complete newbs, with no experience, and I don't think I can go around the circle teaching everyone separately. 




 Nudge. Nudge nudge.
Nudge nudge nudge nudge.
Nudge.
Now your cup is on the floor. 




 Oh, I've lived here my whole life, almost 22 years. Back home, we've had some trees go down and almost hit the house, but we have a basement that's practically a bomb shelter.

My apartment is just old and ghetto with shitty windows. Last September, when we had that warning, I brought the cat I had then down to the laundry  room because I'm a wimp, especially when it comes to the safety of my babies. 




 Now I'm afraid about leaving my cats in my apartment near campus while I have lunch with the family in the far far west side. May just need to be a playdate.  




 And feeling sexy doesn't have anything to do with wanting to have sex/make babies. I often put on a full face just to go buy eggs and watch Netflix all day. I like to feel awesome, and sometimes that means I have to put in the extra effort to look awesome. 




 I only braid it when I'm making a big (2+ batch) loaf for a party and want to impress. Otherwise, loaf pans are fine because the buttery, eggy, fatty deliciousness of brioche is more important than presentation. 




 Since /u/3rdcoastwonder is a coach, I'm guessing he means something like surprise race runs. Going into practice, you warm up as you normally would, then do a time trial or two for the races you usually swim. Practice pools are usually warmer than race pools. 




 Had a professor once who noticed that a lot of the class was out sick for two weeks. He told us to take a strong shot or two of bourbon for each cup of lemon tea.

I took his class the next two semesters in a row. 




 Where do you find this? I can get Harpoon craft cider, which also tastes like aj, but I love me some cider. 




 Still less than three inches deep. 




 Sweet! Thanks, that sounds perfect, then. And as I said, freezing those thick fries/chips is incredibly easy, so I think I will be set. Thank you again! 




 Can you safely freeze fish? I figured it would lose too much, texture wise, but being encased in batter would keep it more moist.

My friends say I'm the queen of freezing (I regularly buy meat the day before the sell by date and freeze individual portions), but I'm never sure about fish.

As background, I'm in Indiana, so most of the fish I get has either already been frozen and rethawed (bacteria if I freeze it again?) or really expensive.  




 Some of the fish stick recipes I've seen have you cook the sticks all the way, then only use the oven to reheat them. Maybe that could work for the batter, too?

I would just buy a bunch of fish and go to town trying to find a way, but I'm a college kid on a budget. 




 I've been told I'm really weird for this, but I even like to snack on it raw. Maybe dip it into a mix of plain Greek yogurt and various seasonings (garlic/onion powder, chili powder, etc.) like you would dip any other vegetables. 




 I have been going through the most intense fish and chips craving recently, but I don't want to keep ordering out (there's only one place in town that will deliver them, and very few that serve them to begin with).

I've found recipes for making things like fish sticks, but that doesn't have the delicious batter.

Could I flash fry the battered fish, like you would pre fry the chips, and then heat them up in the oven? I would love to make a big batch to save.

Tl;dr: is there any way to freeze a properly battered fish to have fish and chips on deck? 




 My ginge boy likes to use the shower. He's learned several phrases, but "I'm mad at you" is not one. 




 This is what snapchat is for. 




 When I was still getting over a dislocated knee, I still worked cute sundresses with my sneakers and huge, ugly knee brace. Not too bad, since I needed it, but I was given some serious shade by the more "fashion forward" girls on campus.

EDIT: I also had some trouble shaving my legs during the recovery process, so by the time the winter from hell was over, I looked like a bear. 




 I recently gained a lot of weight. I was a size six for as long as I could remember, then had some serious joint issues, so I couldn't work out at all without feeling like death for days after. I was just able to go shopping last week, and it hurt realizing that I was up to a 14. I'm tall, and it doesn't feel as bad as other things that have happened in my life, but vanity sizing like this angers me. 




 Like I said, it was the first time I dabbed. My tolerance was high enough to be able to drive after smoking a joint, I had no idea how much higher I would get. 




 Another way to make us size-14's feel bad about ourselves. 




 Kitty looks just like my big boy Guillaume!  




 Makes me remember the first time I dabbed. Did three in a row, not thinking. Had to drive an hour and a half to pick up my mom from the airport an hour later. Worst. Idea. Ever. 




 Chemicals, yes. Everything in the world is composed of chemicals. Air? H2O. But chemicals that cause cancer, unlikely.  




 Yup. In my town, you can find a shitty chillum for $10. I've smoked out of cans, plastic bottle bongs/steam rollers, hasn't killed me yet.
Edit: phone autocorrect 




 Yeah, I originally thought it was /r/beer for some random thing. 




 More short stories should be, though. We only read Huckleberry Finn, and I think this and the War Prayer are equal, if not better, social commentary that is still relevant today. 




 The War Prayer is amazing, as well. 




 Yeah, I can only watch it every few months cuz it puts me in such a bad place for days, even stone cold sober.  




 Mine seem to listen to me more when I'm speaking French. Somehow, they'll always stop whatever they're doing at "tu sais mieux que ca," but never at "you know better." 




 Haha, mine always rub on my legs right after I get out of the shower, them give me a dirty look for getting them wet. CATS! 




 Like everyone else has said, get Smithville if you can. Comcast, on top of being pure monopolistic evil, will fuck you over every have they get. My neighbors can only get AT T, I can only get Comcast. Last time I tried to call, I was put on hold for 45 minutes before my call was disconnected.  




 Mine was more than a week. A friend's  5 days before Halloween, mine the next day, Halloween, bff's on the 2nd..... then another two a week later.

Hooray for confirmed Valentine's Day babies. 




 My neighbor registered his Chihuahua as a service dog for his "separation anxiety." 




 Haha, before I moved and had a bathtub shower, my Kate would do the same. She'd sometimes even sit on the far side of the tub and just stare. 




 Exactly. And good home made bread doesn't have a great shelf life. I make brioche for myself about once a month and have to eat it in two days if I want it to be good, and it takes a shit load of eggs and butter. 




 She specified these colors. I was initially doing a houndstooth pattern, but realized it was gonna take way too long. This one is already almost two months late, since it was supposed to be for her graduation, but each strip only takes about a day. 









 Holy frick, those earrings tho! The makeup is also gorgeous, but I can't get over your earrings.  




 Hell yeah, I'll try to stop by! You're really close to my place, and I love yard sales 




 Surprised at how much I dislike Guinness. The Asahi tasted like your generic big brewery stuff, somewhere between Bud and Hamm's cola. The Midwestern Pale Ale is perfect for people like me, who generally don't like things that are super hoppy. 




 Got a mix-a-six with Baltika #9 (a favorite), Boulevard Unfiltered Wheat, Upland Wheat Ale, Guineas (which I've somehow never tried), Bell's Midwestern Pale Ale, and something foreign, Asahi "super dry" with a bunch of stuff in maybe Japanese, far from any language I speak.  









 And the picture in that pattern is the exact same one as the post.... 




 Only? Of course I clicked the link and started hyperventilating.  




 Like others have said, the Morgan-Monroe park, Brown County forest, and  McCormicks Creek are great. I also suggest the hiking trails around Lake Griffey, and (if it's available for you) Merengo Cave or Spring Mill state park. 




 You can swim in Lake Lemmon? I've tried so many times to find a place that isn't for boats, but never found one. And I've lived here my whole life 




 On top of the fact that Quebecois is one of the ugliest versions of French. Sorry not sorry to you Quebecois people. 




 I don't see how voice commands are better. I remember soending a few days with my grandmother last month, and she kept trying to find out the scores from White Sox games, and it was always faster for me to just type "white sox scores from (date)" because her phone took too long to figure out what she was saying. 

Might have had a bit to do with her Wisconsin accent, but still. 




 Even though it's summer (at least where I am), I'd suggest a soup. I'm not sure if the exact recipe, but my mother makes a great soup with kale, leeks, wild rice, and turkey.

My tip is to find meats at the store that are super in sale (for me it's usually because their sell by date is the next day), portion the chops into bags, and freeze. I can make one package of frozen chicken breasts (usually around $4) and two packages of pasta (~$2 each) last a week when I have veggies, butter/oil, spices, and a dozen eggs (~$3 here). 




 I like lemon tea with a bunch of honey. The lemon clears things up, the honey makes it stick around longer. 




 Are you on the south side? A few of my friends there have seen bikes go missing/have theirs get stolen 




 Don't be ashamed or whatever. I'm a bi girl, and while I can see how genitalia is hot in the moment, it looks fuckin' weird out of context. 




 Like everyone else has said, so sorry for your loss, but it happens to most people, and it does get better.

We had to put my dog down when he was 15 and I was 16. He had terrible arthritis, so would just lie around all day, then get seizures because he couldn't get up to eat. The last six months or so, I made sure to snuggle up in him as much as I possibly could. That was 5 years ago, and I still get sad sometimes thinking about him, but it gets better. 




 I can't comment on Little Blue's, but I got both of mine done by Giacomo at Skinquake and he's amazing. Mine are both simple, but look up his portfolio. 




 Yeah, my family always called them one-eyed egyptians. Not sure where that came from, but that's what we always called them 




 Mulberries are in season, and it's been a tradition for me to pick a bunch and make things with them.

The obvious choices for these wonderful things are pies, cobblers, scones, muffins, and other baked goods.

But I challenge you all who can get to them to make something savory with these berries.

Last year, I made a bunch of spicy Asian inspired dishes with the 2+ pounds of mulberries my friends and I picked.

Idk if challenges are actually ok, sorry if they aren't, but try, kids! Spicy berry pasta is one of my favorite things, so try it out. 




 After reading through that website (thank you!), I think I will try to get to know this kitty for a bit.

Where I grew up, there were a lot of ferals and strays, so I've learned the difference. The cat my parents currently have was a stray that took more than a year to get close to us.

This cat has only been out during the day, and has come fairly close to me. I think she's a stray, not feral, from my experience. I did call the shelter to ask what I should do, but I will wait a bit before taking her there.

I will continue to leave food out, as she seems quite skinny, and see if she becomes more used to my presence.  




 They don't have to be, although most people I know have done it. This cat may be, but that's a big reason why I want to get it to the shelter. 




 I just saw it again, and s/he looks fairly mangy close up.

My local shelter is luckily a no-kill, and I just want to find out if it's microchipped. There's some possibility, if it isn't and would be compatible, I'd bring it into my home, but I already have two. S/he seem quite skittish, probably because s/he's been outside for a while.

I am going to call my shelter to see about anything else I should do. 




 Hello! I've been seeing a tuxedo cat with no tail wandering around my apartment for a few weeks now.

S/he seems to be an adult, probably 18 months or older, black with a white stomach and face, with no tail.

I don't think anyone would let their cat roam around outside in this area (Fess and Atwater) because there's way too many cars and streets, so I'm thinking it may be lost or a stray.

If you know anyone who is missing a cat with this description, please let me know. I'm planning on asking around, and if none of my neighbors know whose it is, I will try to lure it near so I can get it to the shelter.

Update: upon closer inspection, s/he seems a little raggedy, but definitely not feral. I will be working to gain his/her trust for a while, to see if s/he truly can be socialized. It looks like s/he has been out for quite a while, but still hmu if you know anyone who has lost a similar cat. 




 There's been a tuxedo with no tail wandering around my neighborhood for a few weeks now. S/he looks fairly well taken care of, like s/he may have been a housecat, but I'm in an area surrounded by apartments, near streets, so I don't think anyone would let their cat be an outsider.

Should I leave out some food to lure her/him near so I can take her/him to the shelter? Once I can think everyone will be awake, I'm gonna go around and ask about it, but I feel so sad thinking that this beautiful cat isn't being taken care of. 




 Prescription goggle exist, but I doubt you'd wanna put them on every time you toke. 




 I decide if something is appropriate based on whether or not you can see this mole I have on my chest.... specific for me, but it's a good guide for how low-cut I can go. 
























 Hangover breakfast for me means the meal I can finally make myself make at 2pm or later. Or that random food I don't remember ordering. The chips from the tacos I apparently ordered and devoured last night count. 




 Peasant food is usually the best food. 




 In the TATCHED ROOF COTTAGES!!!!!!!! 




 Burninating the country side! 









 This is fascinating! I do something like the last one, but I just hold it between my first two fingers with the yarn behind it, but my tension has always been fine.

OP, I have been feeling the same, so maybe trying one of these other techniques could help. My yarn holding wrist is the one that hurts the most. All I can say from my experience is to take breaks often and make sure you sleep with your wrists straight. If you want, I can contact a former friend with horrible wrists due to 12 years of violin for anything else that may help. PM me. 




 From what I've seen/heard from the one family member who eventually succumbed to it, the worst part is knowing that you're slowly losing yourself.

He was my great uncle (I think that's what you call it, my grandma's brother) and I didn't spend much time with him. But I remember one really powerful event. The whole family went out to dinner, and five minutes after ordering, he turned to my 10-year-old self and told me he couldn't remember what he'd ordered. He almost started crying.

By the end, he was wishing for death because he had been gone for years. The whole family felt the same way. 




 Yup, that's what we called them. Egg in the hole or egg in the basket makes more sense, but what can you say?  




 I moved into my first apartment last August and will be living here till August 2016, and I generally agree with this list.

I only have a couple nonstick pans and a few pots. I've dropped hints that a nice, big cast iron Dutch oven is all I want for my birthday, and I'm getting myself a decent thermometer at the same time.

As a college kid, I will say my (totally unnecessary) panini press/griddle is amazing because I can make a quesadilla or grilled cheese without having to fumble around for a spatula; as a baker, last year's birthday present (a super legit KitchenAid stand mixer) is my favorite.

That being said, I'm lucky to have a 1-person apartment with 4 separate rooms. I'm scared for when I have to move and live in a tiny little box. 




 Without the monsters, that's what my family has always called them. 




 Haven't had a proper kouign amann since I went to Britanny. From what I remember, they are even more caramely and just melt in your mouth, no chewing required.

I've yet to find a recipe that truly lives up to the ones made by old ladies in the middle of nowhere who have been doing nothing else for 30 years. But these look good, and now I think I may have to redouble my efforts. 




 Catfish (and Tilapia and other bottom feeders) taste like what they eat. Personally, I find it tastes more like mud than anything else.

Tuna and swordfish, however, do taste "fishy" to me. A properly prepared ahi tuna steak is expensive because it tastes like heaven. 




 And was charismatic enough and a good enough orator that he convinced so many others that he was, too. 




 Some probability thing. I know I should have been able to figure it out by myself, but my brain isn't wired for finite. Calc, however, made sense when I took it. 




 I once tried to get help with a finite problem and got the answer "yellow is a color." I just don't speak the language, I think. 




 Natalie Portman and Tina Fey. But I identify as bi, so there's that. 




 It's important to find one that you like. It takes a while, and I'm personally trying to find just that, after mine had to leave, but a good therapist can mean the word.

The same goes for meds. Maybe you don't even need them, but when you find the right one, the right dosage, the right combination, you'll know, and it will help. I'm lucky in that the one I was given in the hospital after my suicide attempt only took a couple dosage changes to be perfect for me (and it isn't one that is commonly used, from what I've heard, and was only given to me to make me gain weight, which has become a problem now, almost 2 years later), but once I found the perfect dosage, it has been good. I won't deny that I still want to cut sometimes, but I've been able to bounce back from bad news faster than I would have.

I'm sorry if this post isn't helpful, but don't just write off therapy or meds because they haven't worked in the past. If you find one or both that works for you, it can be an enormous help. 




 He was also just an awful person to begin with, and only sold when I had a boyfriend. He still propositioned me. 




 Maaaaaaybe something like five pounds. I have standards. 









 The only guy I've ever used who eyeballed always packed fat for the girls and short for the dudes, but then expected the girls to sleep with him.

I only bought from him once. Sorry dude, not gonna sleep with you for an extra .2. 




 Fleece lined tights or leggings and wool leggings are my favorite thing. Last winter, when I had to go out with the -30F wind chill, and even other, less cold days, I was known to wear two pairs of each under my bigger velvet pants. They're warm, but still thin enough to layer like that, if need be. 




 Used Red Heart Super Saver in Frosty Green and Coffee. It is throw sized, and I would have made it bigger if I didn't have three other throws to make by Christmas. 









 A pillow to prop up my feet. It technically isn't quite don't yet, but considering my knees and back have been killing me lately and I've been propping my feet up on an empty two-liter to relieve the pain, I bet this will be the best thing ever. 




 I make one similar (I don't really have a pattern), but it's more like a cowl. Chain a fairly long starting chain, like collar bone to eyes, then dc in rows til it just fits around your neck. It's really nice when it gets cold, because you can double it, or pull it up so it covers your ears and face.

Simple, fast, but not too exciting. It does end up looking like a ribbed knit. 




 Scary! I've been on it for a little over a year, and probably have to stop because I can't stop gaining weight. Its so convenient, but health problems are no joke. 




 Dat geothermal energy. 









 I would watch the fuck out of Garak, Elim Garak. He's also one of my favorites, and leading up to him letting those Bajorans go.... mmmmm.  




 DS9 reminds me more of Babylon 5. Space Station, unexpected war, developed interpersonal relationships. 




 I can only ever drink iced coffee, even in January. I hate burning my tongue.

I only go to Starbucks a couple times a year, and usually drink my coffee black, so I felt my yearly PS Frap was just a cup full of sugar. And I know the frap adds extra sugar (I think), but it took me nearly three hors to finish. 




 Thanks! I was planning on stopping by the post office after class today, so I'll see if it will fit. 




 I mean, it was originally a heart medication. The side effects were just pleasant. 




 Dr. Pepper ham is my favorite. 




 I get that. I have 3.5 blankets to finish by Xmas, so I feel bad for every hour outside of class that I'm not working on them. At least my mom and dad have said they're ok with getting them a month or two after Xmas, but I also have 4 or 5 to get done by graduation in May, 3 for early my graduation in December, and I don't even want to know how many by next May. I guess I'm lucky that a lot of my friends are planning on taking a 5th year at college, like me, but still. Since I hope to spend several years in Africa after graduation, I need to finish all these blankets while I can still ship domestically. I'm already realizing the financial pain of shipping a blanket from Indiana to Washington State. I don't want to ship any others. 




 Wine is the best. And a good bottle of Gewurstraminer is never more than 2 minutes and $10 from me, except on Sundays, because Indiana is still in the dark ages. 




 Sometimes you want to go dancing (that's the only reason I ever go out), but making something with warm snuggles to keep you company is usually much nicer than dealing with loud music and too many people. 




 Oh no! I get that sometimes, so a break is good. Ice it if you need, and try to train yourself to sleep with them straight. It took me a couple months, but my wrists have felt so much better since I did. Really, my former friend who played the violin for 12 years taught me the best stretches. 




 AND she was a Mensa member. Bascially, she had pretty much everything going for her. 




 Oh I know. She's a personal hero for me. I wrote and essay on her way back in the 8th grade. Did you know she wasn't allowed in the Navy's medical team because she was too tall? She was a huge badass. 
EDIT: at least I think it was the medical team. It was something to do with the Navy. 




 That's pretty much what a rolling pin is. I mean, I used an empty wine bottle for a long time. 




 Like others have said, bread, cakes, and pastries. I will say I am biased, because I consider myself more of a baker than a cook, but it's very impressive when you pull a batch of croissants from scratch out of the oven when hosting a dinner party.

On top of that, risotto is something that seems impressive but is actually really easy. It's also one of my favorite comfort foods, especially in the winter, since you need to be over the stove for a while. 




 I'm embarking on a Julie and Julia type thing after I get Mastering the Art of French Cooking for my birthday in a little over a month.

Julia Child was considered a master for a reason. While a lot of the recipes require a lot of work, she is incredibly detailed in her books, and mastering those techniques makes it SO much easier to whip up something with what you've got. 




 Baking is also important. And on that note, learning to make puff pastry from scratch is good. Not necessary, but I find it fun, and it's really impressive. 




 "I'LL FUCKIN BURST YE" will forever be one of my favorite insults. 




 Amazing. The BART goes pretty much everywhere, and the different bus services will take you anywhere else.

But this is from the perspective of someone who lives in an area with no trains, buses that are usually so late that they end up on time a couple times a day, and an incredibly walkable/bike accessible downtown. 









 Such troublemakers. 




 Looks just like mine and apparently acts the same, too, haha. 




 It's just how I've always done it. I actually only just recently learned there was any other way. 




 That makes sense. When I do go out, I spend most of the time at one that is low key mot of the time, although at night it's so full of rowdy college kids. There's a drink there that is officially called "Adios Mother Fucker," although I just call it "that scary blue thing I will never order." Give me a vodka cranberry if I'm feeling rowdier than usual, or just a nice cider, thank you very much. 




 I winged these, but I've got a basic pattern.

Ch4, sl st into first ch. 
Hdc 8 into hole made by small loop, increase as normal for 2 rounds (2hdc in every st for first, 2 in every other for second)
2 rounds hdc in toe color, change color, 12 rounds hdc.
Change color, ch 1, hdc in next 16 st, ch 1, repeat for 3 more rows.
Sl st rectangle together, tie off.
Make 1 round hdc in heel/toe color, Change color.
9 rounds to make the ankle part.

The key to socks is making them smaller than you think you need. That will keep them from being too bulky. All together, this project took me just under 8 hours. Used some Red Heart Super Saver and an F (3.75) hook, and made sure to work it a litoe tighter than normal.

EDIT:  this pattern is for me, and I wear a size 6.5 shoe. Basically, you continue the rounds until you hit your ankle, then make the heel rectangle until it takes a little stretching to make it cover the rest of the bottom of your foot. The, you can make the rest go as long as you want. The key is to keep trying the first one on at each step, to see how it fits, write down what you do, and do the exact same thing for he second, unless one foot is significantly larger than the other. 









 Since turning 21 (my 22nd is in a month or so), I've realized that bars are fun maybe once a month. I'll still have a bottle of wine, but $10 for a night is better than $20-$50. 




 I've been watching DS9, and decided to take a little break from making my sister's Christmas Afghan to make socks. 




 Definitely still drinking, but having a bottle of wine while watching what you want on Netflix is better than going to your usual bar and trying to dance to songs you don't recognize because you haven't listened to pop radio in 10 years. Sometimes you still want to go dancing, but perfecting socks is more exciting than spending more by than $20 and still feeling awkward after 3 gin and tonics. 




 I'm pretty evenly split between introvert and extrovert. I feel a lot better when I hang out with people, but I also have what I call "no pants days," which all of my friends understand. And sometimes you get super excited when you finally master an object. 




 Haha, I took a break from my huge Afghan to make socks because it's starting to get a little chilly here in southern Indiana. And I have Star Trek going at all times. DS9 right now, I think I'll be going back to Voyager (my favorite) once this one is done. 




 I wish I had the roomie I had sophomore year, when we both still lived in the dorms, because I love her and I got her crocheting quite a bit, but living alone has its benefits, as well. 




 I still like to go out, but to shows at friends'  houses. Bars are nice maybe once a month, but I always end up spending too much money when I go, money that I could spend on yarn. 




 You choose to stay in on a Friday night and perfect your sock pattern, rather than go out with your friends.

Any other experiences like this?

EDIT: this is speaking from the point of view as a college senior. 




 Climb the mountain of conflict. You'll sound like a fucking Nazi Julie Andrews. 




 I had to restrain myself from going into a whole long thing citing Hobbes and Rousseau on human nature, but I'll summarize with this: humans are always fighting for resources, but form societies so they don't have to.

But I agree, it's safest to assume that everyone you meet is an asshole, and let them show you that they aren't.

Sorry, social contract theory is my shit, and I dork out to it even more when tipsy. Gin makes me a nerd. 




 I don't even want to know how many I'd have if my landlord hadn't capped it at two. 




 I had nightmares about my babies getting hurt, or running away, or any other bad thing when I spent 5 whole days on the other side of the country back in May, even though they were staying with family. I felt a little ridiculous, but I made a two page list of things for them, from "Bill gets 1 cup of food every day while Kate gets 3/4 cup," to "Bill likes to be called the big mister and Kate likes to be called baby." 




 Like I said above, nutmeg is the make or break for brioche for me. A tiny bit in a curry dish is also good, it just deepens the flavor in a strange way. 




 Same with nutmeg. I put a "pinch" in my brioche and couldn't imagine it any other way. 




 Going off the south side comment, 2nd street turns into a highway around the WalMart, and I believe that highway goes to Crane (but don't quote me on that). Once you get past the Kroghetto/hospital area, it's very residential, with fewer students, so if you'd prefer to be away from the craziness, but still close to the bars, I'd suggest looking there. Serendipity, The Root Cellar, The Back Door, and Player's Pub are all 10 or so minutes walking from the hospital, and Brother's, The Vid, and The Bluebird are also fairly close. Sport's is around there, too, but idk if that would be a good fit (I've never been, simply because I've only ever head it touted as "a great place to bang drunk chicks in the bathroom"). 




 Chrome gave me something called snap.do. And something else makes it keep coming back, so I have to remove it at least once a month.

As for other things, I'm not the best with computers, so I just bring my laptop to my dad every time something weird happens. 




 Know someone who broke her thumb hitting the wall after a 50 freestyle race. And I've sprained an ankle doing a flip turn too quick. 




 I used to be ridiculously allergic (to the point where I'd get hives anywhere a cat would lick me), but I spent a year spending almost every day with a friend who had one, and now I only get a reaction if I get cat hair directly on my eyes. I live with two, but I know a lot of allergies won't go away so easily (ask me about metal, spermicide, or aerosol products). 




 I made a New Year's resolution to make blankets for my family for Xmas and friends for graduation. The graduation present imq shipping soon won't be washed, because the recipient is planning on getting a cat anyway, but my dad and sister are super allergic, so I'll be washing theirs a few times before the gifting.  




 It's just extra sad because the recipient is really allergic. 




 Haha, I'm just trying to finish a bunch of afghans for my family for Xmas, but he keep deciding to lie on top of my work, or his sister decides to chew through my yarn. The things you deal with as a cat owner. 




 If you can make it, PM me and maybe we can meet up. I'm going with my best friend, and at least I plan to  e in line by 5, haha. 




 My nails are getting the TARDIS blue treatment. It's free tomorrow night, and the tickets are first come first serve, starting when the doors open at 6. There's a showing of The Intruders at 7, DW live pre-show at 8, and the new season at 8:15. 




 Bloomington. I say small because it's pretty small when you factor out the 40k students. If you're near, go line up at the BusChum before 6pm. 









 I'm so lucky, there's a special screening in my town tomorrow! Why they chose small college town, Indiana, I will never know, but I'm soooooooo pumped.
Edit: and by them, I mean BBC America decided to post about it on Facebook. 




 Like I said, I feel terrible for the kid (whose name is Jager, by the way), but have very little sympathy go the mother. Maybe mow heartless, but I honestly hope the whole thing straightened her up. 




 Cute things make English too difficult. Kitten don't "explore," they "splore." They don't get "excited," they get "escited." 




 Yep, mine and the food is in the cabinet under the bathroom sink. Otherwise my ginger boy would chew through the bag and eat everything. 




 I had a Facebook friend who didn't stop drinking when she was pregnant. She ended up giving birth to twin boys three months early, one of them died almost immediately, and then she posted multiple times a day with a gofundme page asking for help keeping the other one alive.

I ended up defriending her because I believe you have to lie in the bed you made, but I feel so bad for the kid. I actually don't know if he made it, but I hope he did and that his mother learned from the tragedy. 




 Does this mean I'm doing myself harm if I heat up my nonstick pan while I'm slicing bacon and then putting it on? I never add extra oil when I cook bacon, but I turn on the stove, put bread in the toaster, and cut the bacon into halves or thirds before I use the pan. It probably doesn't take more than two minutes to do all that, but now I'm worried. 




 This sounds amazing, especially because I have a serious aversion to mayo. Will be trying this out soon. 




 Let's hope we all get boyfriends like that. The guy I'm seeing is just amazed when he comes over and sees something ivew made. 




 This is a big reason why I always ball my yarn. It adds some work at the beginning, but I don't have to deal with tangles and yarn vomit halfway through an afghan. 




 Thank you! I think that's only a little more than a hour from me! 




 Oh goodness me, I'm not even sure. Probably 9 or 10. I'm turning 22 in October, and it has been my go-to destressing activity for forever. I know I learned to knit when I was 8 and basic embroidery stitches before I can remember (great part about having a mother with a degree in fashion design and construction), but crochet has always been my favorite. 




 If you're more comfortable with PMing me the reply, I understand, but where in Indiana is she based? I'd love to get some local(ish) yarn, and I've been thinking about dying my own, too. I'm in Bloomington. 




 I usually put liner only in the outer third or so of my lower waterline. I feel that it opens up my eyes, and I just don't feel finished without a little something there. A nice dark brown (not black!) Works really well. 




 Yay, another reason Indiana sucks really hard! 




 Cheap canadian whiskey + canada dry is a favorite of mine. Super canadian drink, we call it. 




 I can't do flavored vodka after downing a fifth worth of caramel appletinis. And a really bad time I had once with schnapps. 




 You wouldn't return your child because you didn't feel like taking care of it. An animal is just the same. 




 My little lady came to me as a foster. She was a barn cat, and was 12-weeks old when she first came into my life. I'm so happy I decided to adopt her, because my former roomie (who initially brought into the apartment) didn't ever take her to the vet, fed her straight tuna from a can, and hardly spent any time with her. A month or two after she came to live with me, I decided to adopt her, took her to the vet, and found out she had had worms the entire time. Luckily she has been healthy ever since (it's been about a year), and loves the ginger friend I got for her. 




 My parents' cat love to take lap rides on my grandmother's wheelchair. Now that she's back up to a walker, he just tries to trip her with head buts. 




 You've done it. After being abused, falling for the wrong guy, and never thinking I could love again, you've turned me around. I'm not in love with you yet, but you make me feel like I could be. And more importantly, I feel like maybe you could actually love me back, which is such a strange feeling for me. You understood when I needed a couple days to cry after finding out I'd been stabbed in the back by someone who used to be like a sister to me, and you're okay with the fact that sometimes I just need to talk about the abuse that guy put me through.

Thank you. I more than really really like you. And I needed someone to provide to me that I could feel this way again. 




 I like to put a little on one side of any simple deli style sandwich. I really like it on roast beef and swiss. 




 Occasionally, but that method has worked pretty well for me. Only time it hasn't is with this one rimmel lipstick whose color can only be described as "baby prostitute." 




 And now I need to watch it for the fourth time this week. That's ok, cuz it will give me time for my base color to dry before embarking on a striping tape adventure.  




 My target never has testers, but it's easy to hold the lipstick closeish to your face and teeth and look in one of the mirrors. I'll do a sigle swatch of a textured polish in store, but that's it. 




 I hated Chicago style for so long, because they didn't even tell us that there were citation styles outside of MLA in high school. Now I prefer it, and nothing pisses me off more than when a professor doesn't specify a style, but marks you down for not using MLA. 




 Seconding baba ganouj! I usually hate things that are blended like that, and used to hate eggplant, but that turned me around. 




 Bathroom is les toilettes, plural masculine, I believe. The throne itself is masculine, but the phrase "faire la toilette" means to get ready (brush you teeth, shower, makeup, whatever), and that is feminine. 




 Besides Fleur, who also married in, sadly, no, unless you wanna get into the epilogue. Luckily my ginger is a boy, so there were many more names to choose from. Ended up with Bill. 




 I didn't even consider getting serious with the guy I've been seeing until he got approval from the cats. 




 I'm of the opinion that all ginger cats should be named after Weasleys, but I'm a nerd like that. 
























 Bacon, garlic powder, and sriracha in split pea is my ultimate lazy meal. 




 Just looked at the website for the annual persimmon festival that occurs about an hour south of me, but the recipes were all for persimmon pudding or praline.

I've had some amazing persimmon breads and cakes, as well as jelly type things, pies, crumbles, and even had them on top of pancakes. But I've never had them in anything savory, although I think it could be done well.

The Mitchell, IN, Persimmon Festival is a wonderful thing. 




 That sounds amazing! Risotto is my go-to dish that seems fancy. Bacon, mushrooms, kale/chard, and parmesan is my personal favorite. 




 Glad my French isn't too rusty to understand that. Granted, this the first semester in 7 years that I haven't taken a French class. 




 What a beautiful memorial. So so so sorry for your loss, but now you will always have her. I think if my (not twin) sister passed before me, I would do the same. 




 Now that I know what's in the animal sauce, I'm ok with the fact that I've never been to In n Out, and probably never will. 




 Yeah, this is why I'm afraid of growing hebrs in my apartment. There isn't a single wind that they don't like to sit in. 




 States here, I've only had "Irish" stew from a local place whose famous appetizer is literally deep fried balls of cheddar mashed potatoes, but the stew there is good. Btown is known for ethnic food, but I bet most of it is still far from authentic. 




 Oh sewing injuries. This one didn't happen to me, but my mom. She wasn't paying enough attention using the machine and bam! Needle all the way through her thumb. That was a fun ER trip. 




 I'm drinking myself to death. I'm only 22. I know I have a problem. I go through two handles a week. I miss a lot of class because I'm passed out by the time I need to leave. 

But I'm terrified of quitting. My family says I seem much happier, and I feel happier because I'm drunk. All the time. I have the worst dreams when I go to bed sober. Memories of the man who emotionally abused me and images of him with my former best friend creep up unless I drink them away. I don't start crying for no reason when everything seems funny.

I don't want to stop because I don't like who I am when I'm sober. But I know that this is eventually going to kill me. Whether it be physically or due to the fact that missing so much class will kill my dreams, it will kill me. 




 Like others have said, raspberries, but also a really good, dry red wine. Maybe some pistachios. 




 Hate to hijack a thread, but is there any way to do this with an electric range? It's all I've ever known, amd my current apartment has one. 




 Yup. Pound of sugar, pound of flour, pound of eggs, pound of butter, pound of something else, from my memory. Why they're called pound cakes. 




 It's a sign of psychopathy. But a mental disorder still doesn't excuse it, in my mind. Like, I have been diagnosed with more than one mental disorder, but hurting innocent creatures like this is despicable. 




 Roast beef and melted swiss with spinach, mushrooms, carrots, and green bell pepper on toasted rye with honey and red pepper flakes. A side of proper mac and cheese, the kind that is baked with gruyere, asiago, and parmesan. 




 I always order it "warmed through," or "as rare as is legal.' 




 So, my father has made what we call Lamb-o Bucco for years. It is my favorite dish ever.

However, my father has recently gotten sober, so having any alcohol in the house just won't happen. When he made it this past weekend, he used a mix of cider vinegar and grape juice concentrate. It was good, but nothing like how it used to be.

I don't want to trigger him by suggesting buying those tiny bottles of wine, since he would only need one, but they come in packs of four, but is there any suggestion y'all could come up with? 

TL;DR: alcoholic father in recovery, how to replace wine in recipes. 




 That definitely happens. I made the unrealistic New year's resolution to make all of May family blankets for Christmas, and realized that I won't be able to do it. But good to hear that yours is coming together! 




 I'm working on my second ripple Afghan (and my third Afghan ever after making nothing but hats and scarves). Once you get in the zone, it will come together. Get some stitch markers, if you need them, put on a movie (I've been rewatching Matilda and Mulan a lot), or some show you like (all of the Star Treks are on Netflix, hint hint nudge nudge), and work for a couple hours a day. If you work on it a bit a day, it can come together in a couple months. 




 Not at all! I'm not really a "girly girl," nor a tomboy, but that color combo seems very neutral.

I'm working on an Afghan for my grandma that is about the same height by now, so good luck! 




 I never used to salt my pasta water, and don't really find much of a difference. 




 My family calls it a one-eyed Egyptian.  All of these other names make way more sense, though. 




 They're fine. As a poor college kid myself, I often buy meat the day before the sell by date and freeze it. Sell by usually means use by is at least a week and half later. 




 Haha, that's basically how my tiny high school made beignets in French class. 




 Yes. Cornflake chicken was a favorite of mine growing up, and now I just love non traditional breadings. Flamin hot fried chicken, anyone? 




 Earlier this year I decided to try a spicy strawberry risotto. I've had spicy berry dishes that I loved, but this was so awful. It had sriracha, strawberries, pea shoots, and worst of all, an entire bottle of Gewurstraminer. It was bitter and sweet and spicy all at the same time, and was still somehow fairly bland. Just awful. 




 Same, although I learned the hard way that it's a bad life choice to make a super garlicky dish for someone you intend on making out with. Even though you've both eaten it, it still tastes icky. 




 Ended up only making hats, but I was able to teach a couple people how to make sc scarves, one of them well enough to be able to teach someone else! Sadly, I was only able to stay for 6 hours, because I found out that drinking too many energy drinks is a bad life choice (I've now been up for 18 hours and don't feel tired at all, and Red Bull puke is a thing), but at least I got two and a half hats done!

The knitters got a couple scarves done total, and several people learned new skills! The experienced crocheters/knitters will be finishing projects that were started, so the children will be getting quite a few hats and scarves.

All in all, it was a very successful event. The host was excited to start Project Linus events, even though the nearest chapter is about 45 minutes away. We learned that knit/crochet a thons will probably work better for other times, like noon to midnight, but a lot of fun was had by all.

 My little girl sometimes sleeps with her tail in her mouth. So sweet. 




 That makes sense. I'll look up a pattern or two for mittens, and stick to my hats for the beginners.

I only thought wrist warmers because they're just rectangles stitched into tubes with small holes, which is great for people who may be crocheting for the first time. 




 That's a great idea! I'll look up some patterns.

And yeah, this event is awesome. I always do it with my leftover yarn, anyway, but so far there are 13 people who are gonna be there for at least a few hours. That's a lot of hats/scarves/whatever for those less fortunate! 




 https://www.facebook.com/events/1521030161471079/

This is a great event! We will be meeting to make cold weather gear for kids at the Middle Way House, the local battered women's shelter. It's tomorrow 7pm to 7am, although you don't need to stay the whole time.

If you live off campus, like me, you can still come in through the veranda till midnight. And I bet some of the awesome residents will help you if you may need to go out for a smoke once in a while (again, like me).

There will be yarn, needles, amd hooks provided, along with free snacks. If you don't know how to knit or crochet, there will be people there who can teach you (myself included on the crochet side).

TL;DR: knit-a-thon tomorrow at Collins for a great cause. You can learn a new skill and work for the greater good at the same time! 




 Tomorrow night (7pm to 7am) a group will be meeting on campus to make cold weather gear for the children at our local battered women's shelter. A great cause, but I will be the only crochet expert there, in a slew of knitters (not that I have anything against bistitchuals).

I've come up with an easy, 2 hour children's hat pattern, but is there anything else you'd suggest? Wrist warmers come to mind, which I can also teach newbies in two seconds. 

I'd especially like something to show how big a child's wrists or neck are. I've got a chart about hats, but I hardly ever see kids, so I dont know how big to make these things. 




 I've only recently gotten to where I enjoy cheese, so a mild one is better for people like me. Mozzarella and baby Swiss are my favorites, and I still can only enjoy them melted. So the mildness can be nice for some people.

That said, I hope that I will be able to taste bleu or brie without gagging soon. I'm on my way. 




 Roast beef and swiss on toasted rye. I usually add spinach and mushrooms, and always ALWAYS put a drizzle of honey and some red pepper flakes. 




 My choco chip recipe calls for water. I've been told they're the best cookies ever /brag 




 This. I have one crop top that I pair with a high waisted a line skirt, and only about an inch of my smallest bit shows. That's one of my favorite outfits. 




 My dad's answer to "do you want to pray with us?" is "sure! Let me go get my goat." Haven't been bothered in years. 




 This class sounds awesome. I have a dream of going to pastry school in France. Was the class in French? Do you already live in/near Paris? If not, was it worth the travel, and how did you feel about Parisians? I haven't spent much time there, and both times I went, we spent so much time doing touristy stuff that I got a kinda bad impression. 




 Livers and kidneys are the only things that gross me out, simply because they are organs that filter out toxins.

That said, I have mildly enjoyed foie gras, and cow's brain is one of the most delectable things I've ever had. And I love most things that freak out my friends (escargot and sea cucumber are two of my favorite foods). 




 ....I, I want to be a steak fairy. 




 Going in on it with several other people seems worth it. Personally, I won't do it, just because I remember the horror story that happened after my sister bought one with her boyfriend at the time. It came in about a week before Thanksgiving, when she flew back home. In that time, her freezer died, which meant she came home to two week old beef and its smell permeating a studio apartment. 




 I've had people actively thank me for looking away from my phone when crossing the street or walking through a parking lot. Like, really? It's so rare that you need to thank someone who isn't a moron? 




 Mini toga and makeup to look like my eyes have been stabbed out.

Slutty Pentecostal would be pretty easy. 




 Ok. This is kind of weird.

I hate the slew of slutty costumes, so I intend on mocking them this year. I'm pretty set on my two main ideas, but am unsure how to pull them off.

I will be spending Halloween night doing a bar crawl with some friends, including my bestie. My birthday is the 28th and hers is the 2nd, so we treat the whole thing as birthday Halloweek.

I'm torn between slutty Teddy Roosevelt and slutty Oedipus. With the former, I feel like I'd have to carry a big stick all night, which isn't conducive to bar hopping. I'm afraid that the latter may go over many people's heads.

I'm a 21 year old female (22 on the 28th), 5'8", and around 165 pounds, although I hope to continue losing weight until birthday Halloweek. I'm leaning more towards Slutty Oedipus.

Is there any way y'all could help me with either costume?

TL;DR: I'm torn between going as slutty Teddy Roosevelt and Slutty Oedipus for a bar crawl this Halloween, because I want to mock the slew of slutty costumes you see every year. Help? 




 Haha, if you can come down to Southern Indiana, they're free. 




 Good tip on the eggplant parm. That is also good, because one of the vegetarians also hates cheese, so I could just put less or none on top of a few slices. 




 And the step-dad's opinion clearly contradicts his Biblical argument. Turn the other cheek, hatred is bad; nope, some people deserve hate? 




 Yes! I'm a born and bred atheist, but I have read the Bible and bits and pieces of the Qur'an. Part of why I'm learning Arabic is actually because I want to be able to appreciate the poetry of the Qur'an. It's amazing how people identify as incredbly religious can be so ignorant. 




 I usually just buy distinctive ones. So I can see if someone is using a duck lighter of one with a sexy lady on it after the sesh, and know it's mine. 




 /R/tiltshift it's a photography style or an editing style that is designed to make big things look like miniature models. 




 He's just a big kitty. 




 Def the real ones. 




 Making croissants is one of my favorite things. Thinking about doing pain au chocolat for dessert and making them a day or two in advance, 




 Oh my goodness, that sounds fantastic. Definitely going to save this! 




 Good idea, although there is a distinct possibility that it will have already snowed by the time this is going on. Also, the only grill I have available to me is a mini one that was left outside by the previous tenant. 




 I would be so happy serving just a slew of seafood and shellfish, but I'm sadly the only one of my friends who likes it.

Coq au vin could be good, since it stews for so long it loses its "chickenyness," if you forgive my horrid made up word. 




 Good idea! And squashes are very easy to find around here, and the "health food" store a block from my place has them for months. 




 I've tried and tried to like them. In a stew, with rice, deep fried, baked, blended, I just don't like them. But at least I've tried. The two foods I will just not eat have gone through trying. 




 Duck sounds like a good option. Still just a roast bird, but so different from turkey. Plus, I could put my veggies for roasting under the bird. Vegetarian sides are easy, plus an entree.

I'll have to check out the lentil bolognese. Serious eats is always good, and I love lentils.

Edit:

I ADORE making pain au chocolat. When I make a batch of croissants, I usually do about half as pain au chocolat. And that way I cpuld make a not super sweet dessert a day or two in advance.

Pumpkin sage soup sounds really yummy, and serving it cold means I can transfer it to a bowl in the fridge, freeing up a pot for something else. 




 I get that. My vegetarian friends just always complain about how most big dinners are just that, and I totally understand. 




 I just see it as something totally different. Just like sometimes I just have an intense craving for Easy Mac, even though the proper, baked, three real cheese stuff is way better. 




 Ah! I'm planning on trying shakshuka for an extra credit dinner for Arabic class, anyway, so that's a great idea! I'll look into the pasta, too, although one of the strictest vegetarians invited also hates cheese. 




 That's a pretty good idea. I never even thought of using chickpeas because, personally, I have never found a way I enjoy them, no matter how I've tried (yes, including falafels and hummus). I'll look into this, and maybe try them out on the some people who like them before the big day. 




 Salad is a good idea. And I've been itching to make my own French Onion soup for a while. I'll keep both these in mind. Thanks! 




 All of that makes a lot of sense, especially about hor wellington really needs to be med rare. Idk about meats, but I know at least a couple of these people won't eat a fried egg if the yolk is runny at all.

As for roast veggies, I think that's now a pretty set menu item. So good and so easy. 




 That is a great idea! I will definitely be keeping that in my back pocket.

As for bread, I'm really lost. No one complained about brioche being top rich last year, even with the pound of butter and 12 eggs in the whole loaf. 




 I may very well just end up doing my ham again this year. It was really good, and then I can make stock for split pea soup, which is a must for me over the winter. A vegetarian lasagna or eggplant parmesan, or something with eggplants will probably be my veggie entree.

I'm trying to stay away from traditional Thanksgiving fair, as this will be after everyone else has gone home for it, anyway. 




 Haha, the weird jelly stuff from a can is one of my favorite Thanksgiving things, even though I've has the real stuff and that is the only thing from a can at home. 




 Ooh, fondue is a good idea, although I dont think I can fit another food gadget in my apartment. 




 For some reason, I really like cooking it all myself, besides a little help when I text someone a hour or two before because I'm overwhelmed. I think a big problem last year was that I tried making the brioche the same day. 




 For some reason, I really like cooking it all myself, besides a little help when I text someone a hour or two before because I'm overwhelmed. I think a big problem last year was that I tried making the brioche the same day. 




 Oooh, let's see if I can remember. It was pretty on the fly.

Prep your ham as normal (score in diamonds, put cloves where the scores intersect) and put it in the oven for about an hour, under foil. While that's going, throw and entire bottle of full sugar Dr. Pepper in a saucepan with sriracha, a touch of broth/water, a pinch of nutmeg, and whatever else makes it yummy. Let it reduce a bit. Take the foil off the ham and brush the glaze on the ham every 5-10 minutes till it's done.

Sorry it isn't the best recipe. I didn't follow one past what came up when I googled "how to cook a ham." 




 The main thing is that I'm trying to stay away from super traditional Thanksgiving things, because even a couple days after, I know I'm always so sick of turkey and cranberries and pumpkins.

Flank steak sounds awesome, as do stuffed portabellas. Thanks! 




 I love the idea of roasted beets and brussels! I'm nore looking for an idea for veggie entrees, but that, with the parsnips, baby taters, and rutebegas posted earlier will def be on my list of sides this year.

And yep, I love it, and I'm still in college. I always plan it the day or two before classes start back up after break, cuz at that point we have one week of normal classes, dead week, then finals week. It's good to start the final lap with good feelings and good food. 




 Oooh, I do love me some moussaka. I'll keep that in mind. 




 I don't know if that could be made big enough for an entree, but is def one of my favorite sides. 




 For the risotto, I used two packages of premade butternut squash soup and water for the liquid. Onions, carrots, celery in butter to sweat, then toast your rice. Add the liquid bit by bit while stirring. Add curry powder, red pepper flakes, and a dash of nutmeg towards the end.

The carrots I'm less sure of, but saute them in butter and oil till starting to get soft, then add honey, brown sugar, sriracha, red pepper flakes, and something else. I whipped those up on the spot, so don't know what all I added. 




 I fully apologize for the incoming wall of text. 

I know it's only early October, but the one dinner party I hosted last year was for "friendsgiving," and was the day before classes started back up after Thanksgiving break. It was so fun and I plan on doing it again this year.

I figure that people will be pretty sick of turkey by that point, so a different type of meat, plus a vegetarian option would be perfect.

Last year, I had a huge Dr. Pepper/sriracha glazed ham, curried butternut squash risotto, mashed taters, green beans with almonds, and spicy-sweet carrots, then a berry-lemon cheesecake for dessert, and home made brioche throughout.

I'd like to up my game this year. I think I'll make croissants instead of a huge brioche, but I'm unsure about everything else. The ham was amazing, and I had leftovers for a week, but I'll be inviting a bunch of the same people. I'm toying with the idea of a beef wellington, but I know about half the people don't like mushrooms, and even though you can't taste them too much in the finished dish, some people are really sensitive to the taste.

As for the vegetarian option, I'm at a loss. The risotto would have been good, but my big pot was being used for the taters, and I couldn't time things right. I'd like something I can start before the meat and sides.

Sides are confusing, too. The carrots were a hit, but I had to cook them and the green beans right before the ham was done, which meant having to scramble around while the guests were getting hungry. I don't really want to do taters this year, partially because I'm supposed to be cutting my carbs. Maybe a soup and a couple other things?

The cheesecake was bomb, but I'd like a fallback option in case my friend who makes it has to work.

Sadly, I will definitely just be getting a big box of wine to be going with dinner, but at least my friends' tastes have refined in the past year to go past white zin.

TL;DR: working on the menu for my friendsgiving this year. Need meat and veggie entrees, sides, and suggestions for dessert. Thank you all in advance! 




 I love making several batches. I don't scale up the recipe, I just work on one batch while the other two or three are chilling. There isn't as much down time, which I enjoy. 




 The only thing standing between me and my annual friendsgiving is the state of my tiny kitchen. Dead week (2 weeks after Thanksgiving, hoping I don't dislocate my knee that week for a second year), but my menu is fairly set. Means waking up early and spending a day cleaning, then waking up early the next day, prepping and preparing homemade brioche, a nice roasted ham, butternut squash risotto for the vegetarians, plus multiple side dishes.

EDIT: actually, OP makes me want to make a Beef Wellington with home made puff pastry, then just triple the pastry recipe and make croissants this year, instead of a huge braided brioche. 




 Chicken livers are also sometimes used as a substitute, although I'd be squeamish of those. But I love mushrooms and can't get past the fact that the liver is an organ that fikters out toxins. The only time I've eaten something and kind of enjoyed it, then got squeamish when I learned what it is was a foie gras pate in France while I was waiting for the crab caught 10 minutes away was being cooked. Escargot and frog legs however..... 




 The mustard museum in Wisconsin. I'm not sure exactly where, although my mind wants to put it between Madison and Appleton. It's not a specialty local food, but it is a magical place to stop on your food road trip. Sadly, I haven't been since I was a child and didn't want anything to do with mustard, but my parents always made it a priority stop when we were visiting family outside of Madison.

EDIT: on a similar vein, the Boudin sourdough company/factory is San Francisco. Yeah, you can get good sourdough elsewhere, but going on the full tour is amazing. And their bread is still better than any other sourdough I've ever had. My sister, who lives in Berkeley, signs me up for their bread of the month club for my birthday every year. It loses some quality on the trip to Indiana, but is still heavenly for a base for a Jarlsberg and salami sandwich. 




 Cloudberries, man. Some people have a gene that makes them taste like heaven. But they're really good to the rest of us, too. 




 I'm so much in camp A. I actually prefer Voyager to DS9 and TOS. It's tied with TNG, and I consider Enterprise to be different, mainly because the Xindi war just seems like a long movie.

I grew up watching early sci fi movies/shows. Some of the best memories I have with my father involve watching The Day the Earth Stood Still, the Twilight Zone, and the very very old Flash Gordon serials. Captain Proton, to me, is obviously Flash Gordon, which I love so so much.

As for the social commentary, that's a big reason why I love Voyager. Why is a sentient being that happens to be a hologram any different than one who is made of flesh and blood. While he can be grating, the doctor is one of my favorite characters in the whole universe (although Garak will always and forever be my absolute favorite). He has the attitide of Bones (kinda), the empathy and roundedness of Crusher, the uniqueness of Flox, and the intelligence of Bashir. 




 Same here. 




 Convenience is important. Sometimes you're out running errands or have a short break between classes and find yourself starving, but can't go home for whatever reason.

Slightly different, but there is a food truck here that just makes grilled cheeses. They know the college town market well enough to post up outside three of the biggest student bars Thursday through Saturday nights. I get a plain old grilled cheese with orange cheese like petroleum product and fries every time I go out. Yeah, I could walk 10 minutes home and make an amazing roast beef, swiss, and spinach panini on rye with honey and red pepper flake, but then I'd go to sleep instead of staying out with my friends more. 




 Also bbq. And wings. 




 Yes. I usually go for just PB sandwiches, because that's my preference, but my thinking is that, if you can grill your sandwich, you probably should.

One of my friends in high school always had the same 1st period class as me, and I would often make an extra grilled PB sandwich for her when I made one for nyself for breakfast. 




 Kinda looks like American poutine. But this is coming from someone who's never had real poutine, so take that with a grain of salt. 




 Don't have one. She did have a bit of a habit of biting things that stick out to wake me up when she was younger.... Still have puncture wounds, although I bet those would be even worse on the lower half.

Edit: I think part of it may have had to do with the fact that she was so young when she came to live with me. Probably still thought "those things on your chest mean food," being a mammal and all. 




 From what I've heard and my minimal experience, you are sometimes backed up for hours out on California freeways. I was once stuck on I465 South of Indy for 90 minutes and only moved about twenty feet. We were good on fuel before that, but the stalling and idling meant that we had to go refuel at the next opportunity. I'm guessing that's an entirely possible situation on most highways, sometimes to the point where you run out of gas when you intended on refuelling. 




 Wet willy meaning she licked the inside of my ear. Super not fun in any context, but worst when it wakes you up. 




 We have that back home, and Tiny Lion loves to be on the vent. He also loves curling up on my grandmother's lap and going for wheelchair rides, haha. 




 As I said earlier, it might when they're turned to full blast. But then the cats the curl up next to the radiator. They don't get hot enough to burn immediately of contact, and it's actually one of my favorite things in the winter to lay my pants on top of the radiator while I brush my teeth and stuff, then they're nice and toasty before I have to go face the cold. 




 I can't mount any shelves, as I'm in an apartment. I put a pillowcase or towel down so there's a barrier. When it gets really cold and I have the rads turned to full blast, they know better than to sit on it. Right now, they're fine because the rads are turned to as low as they can go. 




 I also will often use this premade soup as part of the liquid in a batch of risotto. I like fusion, so curried butternut squash risotto is one of my favorite things.

Ninja edit: I'm sure you know, but a little bit of nutmeg goes a long way. I have one of those shitty preground bottles, and I often find even one tap can be overpowering. 




 Second least favorite way to be woken up. The Sorority girl 10am Saturday scream when you're ungodly hungover is the worst. 









 This can be bad even when they aren't chatty. Source: one of mine woke me up at 3:30 this morning for breakfast with a scratchy wet willy. 




 You could always borrow a lady friend's brown eyeliner or shadow.
But I'm in your boat, too. Going as Slutty Teddy Roosevelt for a bar crawl. 




 I was part of the selection team for a literary magazine in high school (I know, I was super cool). Many English teachers offered extra credit to submit. One made everyone write five poems on the same subject for some assignment or another. The crowning jewel of horribleness (this kid should get a Ph.D. in it) was as follows:

Summer or winter

They are most likely somewhere

Animals are cool. 




 I'm a big fan of buying things the day before the sell by date and freezing individual portions. Means I can get a package of chicken thighs for $4 instead of $6-7. Just defrost, mix with some frozen veggies/rice (I have to cut down on rice myself, but it's dirt cheap and I believe makes a complete protein when mixed with the right veggies) and bam, easy cheap meal. 




 OP said he's using packaged soup. If you're making it from scratch though, these are all good tips.

OP, if you're ok with it, I love to add a bit of curry powder/paste. Maybe a smidge of nutmeg. 




 The only time I have ever actually looked for orange cheese like petroleum product was when I was in France. It was a thing to cook an American meal for your host family, so I figured an oclpp toastie and tomato soup was the way to go. Ended up with the ONLY orange cheese in the entire city and warmed gazpacho. Obviously better, but my host mom still didn't understand the appeal. 




 And it's pretty much pointless trying to get good real crab here in the Midwest. 




 Yes, someone else who loves giraffes! 




 This is one of those movies that should just not have a tv version. With how much they'd need to cut out, it coukdnt have bren more than 45 minutes long, right? It's like trying to watch the tv version of Showgirls. There's no point. 
























 We both love cream of whatever soups, Gumbo, and things like Beouf Bourgignon, that require a coating of flour before searing the meat. Of course there are many soups that don't require flour, but I'd like to adapt our favorites to fit her needs. She was only recently diagnosed. 




 I have a dutch oven I got for my birthday a couple months ago that I still haven't broken in, but I'll ask her if she has utensils that haven't been tainted. 




 Sadly, there are no Trader Joe's here in Southern Indiana, but other replacements seem workable. 




 I am planning on making a bunch of soup for a friend with Celiac's. However, all of our favorites involve flour.

I know the obvious substitutions for thickening agents (cornstarch + water, instant mashed potatoes), but what about recipes where you need to cover chunks of meat with flour before searing (beouf bourgignon and the like)? Would rice or almond flour work for things like this?

She is completely broke (not like that "broke as a joke" post, she literally has $5 for the rest of the month), so I want to help her out as much as I can. I was planning on making several types of soup in the next few days anyway, but I never cook gluten free, since I don't have a problem with it.

What suggestions do you wonderful cooks have?

EDIT: thank you all for the suggestions! I will be making quite a few soups with your help this week. 




 Thanks, now I need to watch a bunch of Eyewitness mpvies to further my finals procrastination. 




 Keep supporting her. Since you said you also SH, that makes it a little easier. Suggest that she go to see a professional, but don't push it too much (I just went through something where my friends pushed too hard). Let her know that it hurts you when she hurts herself, and, if she doesn't already know, let her know that you suffer from the same thing.

Furthermore, do not EVER feel that you can help her pain by harming yourself. I know it can hurt, seeing someone you love harm themselves, but the only person who can help them is them. Do what you can, but always remember that. 




 I've met many cats who take worse pictures than Marshall Erikson. 




 Yeah, I always just get the "come over to feed them every day and they'll take care of themselves." Although I did leave both of mine with family when I was gone for a week this summer, but they are both basically dogs, so being alone for a wrek probably would have been bad for them. 




 I even love 21st Century Breakdown. Maybe because it came out when I was 17, maybe because Green Day has had a special place in my heart for as long as I can remember.

The rock opera thing was pretty bad, but if you treat it like any other album, I personally think it's pretty solid. 




 I had no idea that was why! 




 I always laughed when my ex farted near me, even if it smelled. He laughed less, but that's part of why he's an ex. 




 Great Pyrenees are also often crazy. A family friend fostered some for several years and they were all nuts. First one killed himself five minutes after they left by running around and wrapping the chain around his neck (15 minutes before the dogsitter arrived), the second was the only dog to ever bite me, the third and fourth had to be fostered by someone else because they tried to kill each other and the family cats. 




 My religious friends always said that it may be different for everyone. Like, for me it would be eternal winter, for some it would be eternity in a tiny room. Whatever would be the worst for you. 




 Not the same sex, but I introduced my second cat to a girl who was around the same age (11 months). They were snuggling after about a month. 




 I love the little freckled toes! 




 It isn't too hard to get rid of fleas. My apartment was infested when I moved in, so I just spent the night with a friend after deploying the flea bomb and gave my baby a bath with dish soap. 




 http://www.imgur.com/LtbVIyW.jpeg
I'm down! 




 Yup, both my domestic short hairs have it (salt and pepper tabby with a white tummy and ginger tabby), although it is more pronounced in the little baby salt and pepper girl. 




 It may not be food poisoning, but every time I've gone there in my 22 years living in Btown, I spend two days on the toilet spewing from both ends. Maybe we have some weird allergy, but it's still good to make sure. 




 Make sure the kids can handle it, though. I love Mother Bear's, but both my sister and I get violent food poisoning every time we go. I still indulge about once a year, but my sister and I aren't the only people I've heard this from. 




 I'm lazy enough that I don't go online. Try TIS first, then the bookstore. Don't expect anything back from novels (3 years as a French major taught me that), nor from custom books. It's pretty hit or miss, but I always get at least $20 back each semester. 




 I make croissants every couple months, and this is the best trick I've learned. 




 It's soo good. I think the place is called The Blue Moon, but I've never actually been. I've got family from right around there, so they bring some up every time they visit. 




 This! I also like to use a fifth of some liquor in a cylindrical bottle as a rolling pin. While the dough is chilling, put the bottle in the freezer. That way the pin won't warm up the dough too much. 




 I have no idea how they season or prepare it, but a tiny little hole in the wall in Owensboro, Kentucky has some of the best brisket I've ever had. Their mutton and pulled pork are better, but they're amazing. 




 Bloomington/Ellettsville chiming in, we call them potlucks. 




 Oh no, this reminded me that I have one to finish in the next three weeks! 




 The Guardian did a review, and it sounds as sub par as you'd expect. 




 Rabbit is amazing. A little gamey, but it tates like a mix of pork and lamb, from what I remember. I don't have any qualms eating it, because they're so prevalent. The phrase "fucking like rabbits" exists for a reason, 




 I've sadly only had it as sausage. Venison sausage is good, but doesn't have the same gamey flavor.

I have had rabbit, squirrel, and ostrich, though, which are all really good. 




 What I've always heard is "you have a domestic short, medium, or long hair, or you paid some serious bucks for it." Not always true, cuz I have a friend who got a pure bred Maine Coon from a shelter, and I've seen some Scottish Folds at my local shelter, but we haven't selectively bred cats like we have dogs. 




 I need to get a harness for my ginger boy, bwcause he loves being outside, even on a leash, but he bolts and his breakaway collar lets loose and I end up chasing him around the parking lot for 10 to 15 minutes, trying to keep him from running into the street. I'd love if they could be indoor/outdoor, but there's too many cars around my apartment for that. 




 It's sad that New Amsterdam tastes pretty good for my unrefined tastebuds. When I'm out and about, I won't order anything worse than Sapphire, but for a simple mixed drink while watching Star Trek, cheaper stuff is ok. 




 It's good for making vanilla extract..... That's about it. 




 Sounds awesome, besides the vodka (ugh again). The only way I can describe the tatse of vodka, even really good vodka, is "freshman year and regret." 




 I'm gonna finish the ham I made for Friendsgiving Sunday in the next day or so, so I think I'm gonna make some stock with that bone and the chicken carcass I have in my freezer, then make some split pea soup. I'm just hoping to finally break in the enameled cast iron Dutch oven I got for my birthday over a month ago. 




 Simple gin and cranberry for me. Since I'm still a poor colkege kid, it's New Amsterdam gin and Kroger brand cranberry juice, but it's better than nothing. 




 Always helps me. Maybe add a touch of honey, to help it stick to your throat. Whiskey+hot water+lemon juice+honey always helps my sore throats. 




 Buddha only had a male dog friend (Cody), but he only started squatting when he was 14 or so. Copying makes sense, though.

They both lasted for a long time, though. Cody was a cocker spaniel who wandered off one day a few months shy of his 18th birthday, and we put Buddha (a Newfie/Black Lab/German Shepherd mix) down when he was 15. 




 Glass blowing is awesome. I've seen a few demonstrations from the one at Indiana University Bloomington , and I know at one point all the scientific glassware at the University of Wisconsin at Madison was made by my grandfather. It's a skill I hope to gain at some point in my life. 




 And when my old boy dog was at the end of his days and arthritic enough, he squatted just like the bitches. 




 My first grade teacher told us that the reason Northern Indiana doesn't have as many hills as Southern Indiana because the iceberg that sunk the Titanic fell on the country and squished all the hills south. 




 Friendsgiving was amazing! I've still got some Dr. Pepper/sriracha ham left, but the curried butternut squash risotto and green beans with almonds didn't last 20 minutes. And per suggestion, I went with a spinach and arugula salad before everything else.

I didn't have time to bake my own bread or make dessert, but it was still appreciated.

EDIT: I did have to cut a few inches off the top of the ham because one of the cats started licking it while I wasn't looking. Assholes. 




 The more you know!

HuHot is good for what it is. Of course the badly translated stuff from the hole in the wall where they barely speak English is better. 




 This sounds a lot like the Hu Hot chain here in the states. Which is amazing, even though it's a chain. They have a bar where you fill a bowl with meat, veggies, and sauces, then they stir fry it all on a huge metal slab.

Nice to know the origins, because it was a huge deal when Hu Hot opened here in southern Indiana. 




 I always make a boatload of cookies (chocolate chip, sugar rolled in various colors of sugar, gingersnap, and these weirdly amazing salty oatmeal ones), fudge/truffles (mint chocolate and kahlua are the most popular), and fancy chocolate covered pretzel sticks (over the years there's been white and dark rolled in crushed candy canes, peanut butter and bittersweet, and so many others). 




 Here's why I only go on $3 Thursdays. Still $3 for a double at my usual, although it's $6 once my friends and I go to the club across the street. 




 So sweet. In other news, I have that same panini press/griddle. 




 And it ain't nowhere near big enough to be a malamute. Also, I'd think a dog indigenous to Guam wouldn't be that furry/kinda fluffy. 




 OH GOD, WHERE DO I GET THE SALTED LICORICE ONES?!?!? I guess my Scandinavian heritage is showing, because salted licorice is my second favorite type of candy (regular licorice being number one). 




 Never heard of it before, but I bet I do. 




 You've gotta wait a bit before consuming. Mix the pellets in with some of the melted stuff, and oh man. Makes me think back to when we had a kiosk in the mall at home. 




 I have sone undergrad friends who lived in Tulip Tree. Not sure if it was hard to get a spot, but it was an amazing 3 bedroom, 




 Where's the option for strawberry?!?

Edit: although I may just be weird, cuz pistachio is a close second for me.... 




 Love them all, but so so happy about your comment on Alloy. Reminds me of a terrible pale pink lipstick I vought once that can only be described as "baby prostitute color." 




 Haha, I love being able to hug her so easily, even though she protests. And I'm enough of a spaz when it comes to the health of the kitties that I call the vet pretty much the second I catch one of them puking, because they hardly ever do it. 




 I don't ever have bananas :-( 




 I learned the hard way to only cook chicken the second it's defrosted. I'm usually a skeptic when it come to exact guidlines, but eating chicken that has been frozen, then in the fridge for three days, is a terrible, terrible idea.

Also, as always, smell it. If it smells even the tiniest bit off, ditch it. It's better than spending three days on the toilet, switching which end your illness comes out of. 




 I'm hosting Friendsgiving on Sunday, the day before classes start up again. Several of my friends weren't able to go home for Thanksgiving (although they are getting a good dinner from another friend), and I hope to send them home with some leftovers, since I can afford it. So, I'm planning on something untraditional, since I get sick of turkey in a few days. Does this menu sound good?

Dr. Pepper glazed ham (had it last year and everyone seemed to like it)

Curried butternut squash risotto (another favorite from last year, and a decent vegetarian entree)

Roasted mixed veggies (I'm thinking turnips, beets, parsnips, and carrots)

Green beans with almonds

Brioche to go with it all (making brioche is awesome)

And pain au chocolat for dessert (making croissants is even more awesome). 




 I really like sauteed green beans with almonds. Butter and oil if it needs to be vegetarian, just oil if it needs to be vegan. 


Spicy glazed carrots are also good. I usually saute the carrots for a bit, then glaze with a brown sugar, sriracha, and water reduction.

These are both things I serve at my Friendsgiving, since I have a lot of vegetarian friends. 




 She'll be two in March, and only weighs 6 and a half pounds. The vet always comments on how petite she is. 









 I called those circular bales of hay "hay pigs," for a really long time. Kids are just silly. 




 I've only made then a couple times, but I'd agree that is too short. I put mine in the water before going to the store for wine, garlic, and bread, then rinsed them again. It was about 45 minutes. Super amazing, not sandy at all. 




 "Authentic full English breakfast poutine barbeque pizza paella" 




 Mine are technically Katrine and Guillaume (former French major). Kate because everyone I've ever met woth that name is super feisty (my dad only calls my mom that when she's being feisty, haha), and Bill because I hold the belief that all ginger cats should be named after Weasleys, haha.

I couldn't imagine fostering that many! Kate was a foster failure, I only got Bill because she needed a friend. 




 Haha, I posted a pic a while ago of my kitties lounging on my radiator. Now that it's turned full blast, they just do just what yours is doing, 




 Apparently I'm weird because I can't not give animals human names. I've got Kate and Bill. This little girl looks like a Sophie to me. 




 This, and water if you're shaping cookie dough into balls. 




 One of my best friennds hates peas for the same reason. I don't get it, but everyone has different tastes. I personally don't get how anyone can enjoy avocados, so you do you. 




 The dreaded three-day hangover struck me a couple weeks ago. Get yourself some oatmeal, that's my number one cure. 




 I think they migrate to those who are severely allergic first, though. 




 It's still a good idea to get a round of rabies shots after getting bitten, just in case.

My mom got bitten by one that got into the house earlier this year, and the doctor told her to go through with the shots. Sadly, even with insurance, it was $2400 for the whole thing, and it apparently hurt like hell (especially the one directly into the wound the day of, but getting several in a couple weeks would suck anyway). 




 Thank goodness I wasn't the only one who noticed. 




 Aww, I actually enjoy Enterprise. It is quite bad (the theme mskes the Firefly theme seem like a masterpiece, haha), but I still like it. 




 All of the Star Treks. The idea that there may one day be an Earth without poverty, without war, it's amazing. Voyager and Deep Space 9 are my favorites, but they are all wonderful. 




 I was one for two years in high school, and I always had the same early morning shift at the school. You get really attached to the people who come to your pool three times a week before work, and they get attached to you. They compliment you on your musical tastes, or tell you stories about "that time I saw Eric Clapton." They literally trust you with their lives, and they ask you about your swim meet that evening (a few of the guys who came in were either teachers or had children on the team). They ask how you're doing, and get excited when you tell them about your future.

It's been almost 4 years, but I still have a huge affection for "my old guys." 




 When I was little, the optometrist my family went to was named Dr. Ball, which was probably a terrible name. However, the clinic had a thing where they added the word "eye" before every doctor's name, so he was called Dr. Eyeball. It was pretty awesome when I was nine. 




 My eyesight isn't even that bad, but my optometrist is one of my favorite people. 




 "12 at night, love or fight/any way is right if you come out in night/its sp out of sight in Devil's Canyon."

Not quite as bad as I remembered, but no Leonard Cohen. 




 Free? My grandmother has been in this type of facility twice (2010 when she got her knee replaced and late last year when she broke her hip), and it was incredibly expensive. That facility works as both a nursing home and a rehabilitation center, and does get donations from the community, but staying there, even for a few weeks, can rack up a 5 figure bill. 




 IIRC, he wrote a song for them, but they rejected it. It's been a couple years since I re-read Helter Skelter, but my copy has a couple if his songs, and they're bad. Like, really really bad. 




 I sadly don't have any from that age, but here's a recent one! She's only 6 and a half pounds, and will be two in March. Tiny tiny.

http://www.imgur.com/null.null 




 Being in the good side of your landlord is a good idea. I call the property management company about everything, so I only have to pay pet rent for one of my two kitties. Means I can't foster another, since I asked them before trying, but being on the gopd side of your landlord is really good, since they could make you homeless, if they wanted to. 




 Kinda makes me happy my landlord won't allow more than two pets. The two kitties make it hard enough to get thing done. 




 A calico and a goat? This picture is my dream. 




 This is exactly why I got cats instead of a dog (although I didn't intend on getting any pets until my former roommate decided to foster a kitten who stole my heart). Even a large single apartment isn't good to the type of dog I'd like, and class means I couldn't take a big Rottie or Newfie or Irish Wolfhound (my favorite) on as many long walks as he'd need. Once I move into a house with a big enough yard, I will get myself a nice big dog. 




 My tiny runt would disagree. She was only a tiny bit bigger than this at 12 weeks, when I met her. 




 Those look even higher quality than the ones I have. But they're lifesavers. 




 Also remember to allow for the fact that it will take longer to walk anywhere and that parking lots are always treacherous. I had to make a run to the Kroger on 2nd this morning before class, and nearly faceplanted several times in the parking lot alone.

I will also suggest going on Amazon and buying what can only be described as tire chains for your feet. I will look them up later, but they're $25, and are perfect for those of us who have to walk everywhere on the ice. Saved me from several bad falls last winter. 




 "And don't know how old it is" = proper sourdough starter. Jealous. 




 AirFrance has some pretty legit food, or at least it did in 2010. I mean, it's legit for economy class airplane food, but the French take food seriously enough that even the airplane food was decent. 




 O'Hare is just so legit. Only flown out of and into it once, but it was so much better than the Indy airport (which is actually really nice). SFO also has some really legit food, although $6 for a caprese sandwich is a bit much. 




 One of the only bad things I've found about the Indianapolis International Airport is that this is so not true. There's McD, shitty "mexican," and shitty "asian." Although, I've only ever flown out of it in the morning, maybe there are better things open past 9am. 




 Especially if you make the puff pastry from scratch, which is one of my favorite time intensive things to do. 




 I just brew some insanely strong coffee and use that to replace the water in ny recipe. 




 Not Thai, but there's a cajun restaurant I go to fairly often, and I always order the "spicy thai" etouffee, and they say that they are legally obligated to tell you how spicy it is. 




 First off, it's great that you're cooking for your family, and that you enjoy cooking.

Don't get too down because they don't express their feelings on the intricacies of your cooking. Some people can't pick them up, and some people don't even realize what the different flavor combinations are that make something taste good. I cook for my friends fairly often, and, while they say it's good, they don't say "oh, the nutmeg is what makes this curry really good," or "this is perfectly spiced." 




 This is me with Rally's. Dat fry lover's burger, tho. 




 Stoned. Fuck yeah. 




 I had a thing for dog treats when I was little. And I know a couple people who would eat wet cat food. So not too weird. 




 Upvote for music suggestion, although I would say that you should never ever ever skip Touch. Took a couple weeks, but that song def turned into my favorite of the album. 




 Ohmygod, ohmygod, mom, this box is so much fun! 




 Qit. Edit: 



 




 My parents got an electric cast iron one as a wedding present, and it still works wonderfully 30 years later. 




 I'm def gonna be trying this, cuz I personally dislike chickpeas. 




 I also suggest stocking up on sauces and spices you know you like. When I cook for friends, it's often just pasta+veggies+whatever genre of sauces and spices I'm feeling. Curry powder+nutmeg+red pepper flakes, hoisin+garlic powder+red pepper flakes/sriracha, or carbonara (noodles+bacon+egg+cheese) are some of my favorites. 




 Selling ramen at the liquor store? The only better idea I've even seen is the grilled cheese food truck that parks outside the bars every night. 




 Seconding the celeriac. My family used to always have a stock of cream of celeriac soup on deck until my dad found out he was allergic to celery. 
























 Swiss and white cheddar on rye with honey and red pepper flake. 




 You went to Denny's. 




 Really?! I'm from Bloomington and the Dreaded Breaded is everywhere (that's at least what my family always calls them). 




 Pretty much any curry benefits from a long simmer. I love my crock pot for dal (lentils), but I'm not sure if that counts as a grain.

I don't have my own recipe, but tortilla soup can be made as spicy as you want. Same with chili, but I won't open that can of worms because I'm a beans-in-chili heathen. 




 I may have to do this to my various suitcases, even though I make a point to only buy distinctive ones. 




 Depending on how sad, the album Everything to Everyone by Barenaked Ladies has so many good ones. Aluminum, Unfinished, and Take it Outside are good for first level sad. My Love, Next Time, and For You are second level. Upside Down is my ultimate angry song. War on Drugs is my favorite song ever, but it's a real tear jerker. 




 This has been my ringtone for almost a year. 




 I've had white corn, I was thinking more that it seems over cooked. 




 Only looks shitty because there's not nearly enough gravy and the corn makes my Hoosier heart cry. 




 Sally Hansen Xtreme Wear in Golden-I. Don't got the money for OPI. 




 I love me sone gin. About to get a handle of New Amsterdam. This was just because I was broke last week. 




 Also a girl. I guess being a good friend means my own problems don't matter. 




 Also just spent my second night in a row that I passed out before taking my meds.

My friends are fucking nuts, and pretend to love me while I hide behind a fucking smile. I'm supposed to be there for someone who blacks out every day and repeats over and over about how much it sucks to have people falling for her all the time, while I'm so fucking alone that I can't even get laid when I try. And she fucking ignores me when I start to cry.

I need better friends. 




 Went out last night to see Whitest Kids U Know again. Almost got kicked out because my friend was too drunk. Then we went to the only gay bar in town, they stopped serving me and she got legit kicked out. Then I went to a house show, got my knee kicked in while trying to dance.

Just waking up now, still drunk. 









 Plant birches. Creepy ghost trees for your creepy forest cemetery. 




 Waiting for Across the Universe to finish downloading. Musicals and gin help me forget my problems. 




 Watch Mamma Mia. Fuck my neighbors, fuck my only class tomorrow, fuck people, fuck boys who don't understand going through a handle of gin every 3 days. 




 Last time I had Jungle Juice, it was just cheap vodka and Hawaiian Punch. Mix accordingly. 




 Lauren?

......if you get this joke, you know where I live. 




 The really shitty local channel in my Southern Indiana town had basically the same thing for a while like 8 years ago. At 3:30am, still not naked. 




 And as someone who is nuts for peas, I'll have to try it, too! 




 I have a shit ton, too. My GP looks at the big ones every once in a while, but even the irregular ones have always been fine. If they start to hurt or change, go to the doctor; otherwise, you're probably fine. 









 Because I just got an IUD implanted. Too bad I'm too crampy to go to the ATM and my guy has already left for Spring Break. 




 Seasons 6 and 7 don't hold candles to the rest of the series. But I'm also the type of person to have it going pretty much constantly as background noise, because I don't even want to know how many times I've watched it through. 




 We always called them One-Eyed Egyptians. But I've never heard that outside my family. 




 I can't personally do this, but I know the people who run these events on campus, and they're super awesome people! 









 I use my friend's sometimes, and got one years ago for my multiple joint sprains and dislocations. A brace is still necessary most of the time, but it can keep the pain from being too bad. In my experience, at least. 




 Thanks, now I'm overwhelmed with my earlier desire to order a pint of mac and cheese. 




 Same thing if you ate a lot of chili. 




 More than sort of. 




 Crying now because of the news of Leonard Nimoy's death. But I agree. Trek is my ultimate escape.

Edit: may you all Live Long and Prosper. 




 My joints make it impossible to leave my apartment on a weekly basis. I did ballet for 9 years, so I'm used to sprains, dislocations, slipped disks. I'm 22 years old and have arthritis.

I slipped on the ice on my way to class Thursday morning. It didn't hurt too badly, so I didn't bother going to the Health Center on campus. Since then, it has gotten worse and worse. I serioualy think I may have re-dislocated the knee I injured last winter.

And I don't care. I've been wanting to cut again recently, so the pain from this injury is actually making me feel better. It wakes me up at night, it takes me 5 minutes to walk from my living room to my bathroom, I start crying when my cats decide to climb into my lap, but I don't want to see a doctor about it.

The guy I've been seeing thinks I have to go, even though I know that the doctor will only say things I already know (stay off it, wear your knee brace, ice and heat), but he doesn't know my history with self harm. He knows I'm depressed, and that I've been through an abusive relationship, but not that I've cut on and off for 10 years. 




 Another excuse to drink gin and eat rosemary? Sounds good to me. 




 It's just another way of frying an egg. Look up the crispy egg. I will never turn back. 




 We even have it up here in IN, also at Kroger. 




 If you can steel yourself for a trip over to Ellettsville, the hill in front of Edgewood High School is great. But, you have to go to Ellettsville. 




 Especially when you realize how sharp that knife has to be. 




 http://www.chocolatemoosey.com/2014/06/26/strawberry-layer-cake-with-cream-cheese-frosting/

I love this strawberry cake. I do usually put on chocolate icing, but it's great on its own, too. 




 Haha, I'm actually watching that season right now. Really really good. 




 Happy Birthday, Romeo!
My furbabies have a shared birthday next month, also almost 2. Here's to furbabies for the next 10-20 years! 




 That's a great idea! However, this yarn is so beautiful and soft that I want ro make something to wear (for the past month, all I've done is rub my face on the skeins). 




 I do love arm warmers, maybe I can use the silk blend for that. They would feel much nicer than the long acrylic ones I made a couple years ago. 




 I'm thinking a beret, at least of the peacock. I already have an amazing winter hat that I've worn every cold day for three years, but maybe I have enough for a nice fall/spring hat. 




 So, for Xmas, I got a gift certificate for my LYS. I mainly got some gorgeous wool, but also got two skeins just because they were pretty, which I never do.

http://www.imgur.com/bhqzu4n.jpeg

Here they are. The peacock one is 100g (197yd), 70/30 acrylic/wool, and the other is only 50g (109yd), but 75/25 wool/silk.

I'd like to make something I can use on a regular basis, but don't know any patterns for this small of an amount. Since I've never bought yarn without a project in mind (I know, you'd think I would have after nearly 13 of crochet), I'm stumped. Plus I've had afghans on the brain for the last year or so.

So, anyone know of good patterns for small amounts of yarn? 




 More pictures of Bill, and one with his sister, Kate.

 I think I grew an extra pair  




 I keep seeing this around here and keep wanting to find it in real life so I can learn tatting, haha. My Grandmommy taught me all the other things, but tatting died with my great grandma on the other side. 




 Looks like a modified star stitch, but I'll let OP identify it exactly. 




 I went with kitties because of a foster failure and needing a low key companion, since I'm still a student. As much trouble as they can pose (playing with or chewing through yarn), they are necessary. 




 Congrats! 


I'm super single, but still look to things like this for my future wedding. I thought I was crazy for wanting to make my own wedding cake, haha. 




 I just want to share something my non-crafty sister posted on Facebook a few days after I gave her an afghan: "A handmade blanket is like a permanent hug from the person who made it."

It brought a tear to my eye, and reminds me of why we all make things for the people we love.

Edited to correct the quote. 




 Oooh, je t'aime, tu es trop mignon/ne. Or maybe it's just that my (American) cats seem to respond better to French. Sophistication and such. Mine know "tu sais mieux que ca" and "ne mange pas cela, ce n'est pas la nourriture" better than "you know better than that" and "don't eat that, it's not food." 




 My Katie was a failed foster, haha, but if you can let them go, fostering is a wonderful way to get some kitty love in your life. 




 The orange one miiiight be big enough for all of these. I also have a boatload of bigger rectangle scarves that I love for using as mid Spring skirts. Thanks for the tip! 




 That is beautiful, thank you! And I think it will look good with the orange one that is an all over pattern, 




 That napkin style is how I always wear square scarves. The first style is also lovely, I'll have to try it.

Since I usually don't have a purse with me unless I'm going out (where I do not at all want to take a vintage silk Liz Claiborne scarf, haha), I won't do that style, although I love it with cheaper scarves. Thank you! 




 I recently got these three gorgeous scarves from my Grandmommy. They are all fairly light, and have at least some silk in them. The mint one and the pale pink (looks white in the photo) are both Liz Claiborne, and my sister got several Liz ones as well.

How would you style these? Today I'm wearing a mint sweater with the mint scarf, dark blue skinny jeans, and short heels in a similar color (it's gonna get up to 40F here, so I only need my stupid looking warm hat for a few hours).

Edit: she will be 93 in March, so all of these scarves have stories behind them. I know how to care for them, but styling is not my forte. 




 I'd easily kill the seaweed ones in one sitting, and I'd have to try the blueberry. I could see them being quite nice. 




 I'm not even a huge fan of walnuts, but that cake sounds wonderful! 




 Is it only when they're alone? Like, do you like custard? I have plenty of friends who gag at runny yolks, which just means I never cook eggs for them. 




 I don't know exactly. The taste and the texture just don't do it for me. 




 Seconded, although that's oartly becwuse it's mostly mayonnaise or Miracle Whip round these parts. 




 Haha, I love okra! I eat it raw like a carrot! To each his own. 




 As long as you've tried it several times, it seems fine by me. People have different tastes. I just tried pickled herring again for the first time in years this Xmas season (my family is Scandinavian, so pickled herring and spekemat are always there) and finally learned to love it, but still hated the hummus privded, too. 




 I'll add another, that no one I've ever met seems to understand: avocados. I have no idea what it is, but I have never met an avocado that doesn't make me want to turn away and restrain the gag reflex. 




 Does this still happen with onions that are cooked or caramelized?  




 My dad and sister both have the "cilantro tatses like soap" gene.  




 I'm similar. My thing is that liver and kidneys are filter organs. They filter the toxins out of the animal. Give me a fried brain sandwich and I'm happy, and I've recently gotten into buying ground beef heart, because a local farmer sells them to my favorite local grocery/health food store for super cheap, and super delicious. 




 I feel you on cheese. Only in the last few years have I been able to handle it, outside of pizza. And I still can only eat mild ones, and only when melted. 




 Ao glad I'm not the only one! It tastes like mud! 




 I used to be like that. The very smell made me nauseous. 




 That reminda me of when I decided I'd learn to like coffee when I studied in Frnace back in 2010. Mine went better, though, although now I can only drink really strong black coffee, haha. 




 I love black olives on pizza, but in any other context I can't even handle the smell. 




 I'd think Sunny D could be ok in a screwdriver, although I haven't been able to touch the stuff since I had a bottle that went rancid when I was 6 or 7. 




 Reminds me of when I was a little girl and decided to make gingerbread cookies for my swimming teachers. Misread the recipe and used baking soda instead of baking powder. Those things tasted awful. 




 I am always happy to cook for people who don't like certain foods, but personally will never say that until I have tried a food in every way possible, several times.

For me, I personally cannot stand chick peas. I've had them in stews, curries, falafels, hummus, what have you. Same thing with mayo. Alone, mixed with anything, the only time I think I've eaten it without gagging was when I had walnut shrimp in Chinatown in San Francisco this past May.

So, what else fall in this category for others? Sometimes you try hard to like something and just don't, and I think that is just fine. 




 For ones that aren't as super popular, /r/ladybonersgonecuddly, /r/askhistorians, and any of the subreddits for your hobbies, like if you crochet, /r/crochet is awesome 




 I'm 22 and still sleep with one every night. Same deal with my sister, who will br 27 in April. 




 It's Elmer the Patchwork Elephant!  




 Had it all the time when I was studying in France. Can't say it's amazing to my (quite broad) American palate, but good for spreading on crackers while waiting for the rest if the meal. 




 I really like how all the flowers are the same color throughout. I'm working on my first stuffed animal based on the african flowers (giraffe for me, since they're my favorite animal). 




 So jealous. It's 10F here right now, and I need to layer up to go grocery shopping. 




 Not to mention all of those Eye Witness kids documentaries. Those things were my favorite growing up. 




 Good to see some mulberries! Every summer I go around town every day for a week or so and pick as many as possible. I still have 2 full gallon sized bags in my freezer, so I think I'm gonna make one of these soon. 




 Some people don't like peas. I'm not one of them, and I don't understand them, but it is a matter of taste. Good on you. 




 22 year old female in Southern Indiana, USA. I'm a political science major and Arabic/French double minor, planning on taking a fifth year of college (and possibly picking up Dutch in that last year).

I live alone with two wonderful kitties, who are my life. I consider myself an intermediate crocheter; I have never done fancy stitches, but I can pretty easily draft patterns using the stitches I do know.

I hope to post more in 2015, and I hope to learn a lot more. 




 Still working on last year's to make blankets for all my family (and hopefully friends for graduations), but I'm also gonna make myself somthing nice, because I haven't done that in ages and I got a gift certificate from the local yarn store that my mom actually forbade me from using for someone else, haha. 




 I love that stuff! It's my grandmommy's favorite. 









 God, a shit ton of my Facebook friends do this. I've called a couple of them out on it, but they all just freak out and say that it works. 




 I was making a really dumb face, haha. 









 You can get anything at a restaurant or wineries/breweries, but that's it. 




 Weed is my #2 hangover cure, #1 being oatmeal, haha. But nothing but water prevents a hangover for me. 




 I absolutely cannot mix them, even though I'm experienced with both. 




 At least a store is open today. Even the Kroger by me closed at 6pm yesterday and won't open till 9am tomorrow, and it's open all day on Thanksgiving. 




 Could be shitty Indiana, where you can't buy any on Sunday at all, till 7am Monday morning. 




 They can be, but if you make sure to either use entirely separate utensils (including cutting board) or wash evrrything in super super hot water a couple times in between, it should be ok.

As for a smaller shrimp dish, I'm a huge fan of shrimp and grits. Look for any recipe, although when I'm lazy I just put the two together, mix a boat load of butter into the grits and smother it all in Old Bay. I know it's not traditional, and Old Bay isn't as common outside Maryland, but I can find it here in Indiana if I look hard enough. 




 Thank you so much for the detailed answer! This is wxactly what I need. 




 As I said before, I'm gonna play it safe, but I assume it would be like any other allergy. I have friends who suffer allergic reactions from secondary exposure, and that's why restaurants specially prepare items when a customer says they are allergic to something.

Better safe than sorry. 




 And this is why I'm gping to ask if she could bring some untainted utensils. We're going to be cooking together, because that's our thing, but I want to keep her from getting sick. 




 Good to know! Thanks!  




 My friend has legit Celiac's, as in she gets very sick for days after ingesting any gluten at all. So I'm gonna play it safe and not use anything with gluten at all, including any utensils that have touched flour. I want to share the holiday spirit, not make her sick when it wanted to be nice.

Edit: I also have the experience of a father who needed an epi pen after eating sonething fried in peanut oil, so I'd rather be safe than sorry. 




 Good idea. I was planning on making some chili anyway (and yes, I'm a "bean in chili" heathen), so I will definitely include this in my soup-a-palooza. 




 Thank you! We both love soups that kinda require a roux or some type of flour covered seared meat, so this is very helpful!

Edit: plus we like to cook fairly in depth recipes together, so the fact that I have a copy of Mastering the Art of French Cooking plays a bit of a part. We both think of Julia Child as a personal hero, so it's been hard to adapt.
