 I'm sure people who kill can not control their rage during the moment of the kill, unless you speak of sociopaths or psychopaths who enjoy that moment. During this moment of the kill murderer's do not care about what troubles they will run into in the future. 'Normal' murderers realize the ramifications only after their acts; this is why 'normal' murderers run away from the scene of the crime or attempt to dispose of the body and the evidence,  obviously not very well  since they are caught fairly 'fast' unlike serial killers whom are caught only after a spree. 

Allowing the victims family to deal with the murderer is a primitive idea, because who is to say that the murderer's family will not go and kill someone in the victim's family?  These codes /rules/ laws exist in real life. For example if you look at Albania they have this code called the kanun, which dictates punishment like this.  When someone is killed by someone else then someone from the victim's family must seek revenge to honor the dead. This goes on until the males of the family is wiped out. However people stopped following the Kanun and do things their own way! 

 Following rules like you propose in your comment is destructive towards society because their will be retaliatory killings amongst the victim's family and the murderer's family. The victim's family becomes the murderer to the eyes of of the original murderer's family and then this family becomes the victim.  Not only is the community affected emotionally but the economic ramifications far out weigh the benefits because their will be a lack of people to work and stimulate the economy as a whole. 

Even with strict rules to your proposition, the rules will not be an exegesis hence people will do as pleased. People will bend the rules and find loop holes.

 Joke 
























 People have said religion, but the problem goes far beyond the scope of religion. Its oppression, created by their leaders and social structure not Islam and economic disadvantage and the lack of education due to the lack of a good economy to support a knowledge base. 

People are drawn to ISIS because they believe that by joining ISIS they'll escape oppression in turn leading to a more comfortable live. THEY ARE SO WRONG. ISIS does everything that's against Islam. In Islam you'll go to hell for persecuting other religions, especially Christianity and Judaism, to which Islam shares so much with. One of the main Islamic celebrations is from God asking Abraham to sacrifice his son Isaac which is in Christianity.  Also Muslims believe is Jesus.  So it makes no sense to persecute these "unbelievers". ISIS will survive by oppression. These ISIS members think they'll be free from their current tyrannical despots but they are just feeding another tyrannical despot. 

In Islam men and women are equal in any social structure. However, people will not know this unless they're educated, in the sense of religion and the regular schooling, SIS is not going to be willing to provide education that is free of censorship. These ISIS subjects will never know what real Islam is. The Islam they'll know is the version that best fits the needs of ISIS. 

Like the Al Qa'ida, they'll garner a bad reputation for the Muslims living abroad in the West (read reddit comments below for proof). They'll do this so the Westerners are racist and stereotypical towards the Muslims in turn the oppressed joins/ understands ISIS's cause. 

The best course of action for the Western countries is not only to bomb these fuckers, but to spread what the real Islam says via radio and TV broadcasts. I assure you that most of ISIS's members are uneducated and thus they are easily deceived by ISIS's Imams because they have always been told to trust like you would trust a man in an uniform than the guy with chinos and a t shirt on.

 Money isn't really the issue. The real issue is that we have lost the principles that America was founded upon. We have lost our right to privacy. We have laws like the patriot act where existing laws can be sidelined in the name of national security. Money can always be earned but our rights as citizens are gone-- possibly forever. All we can do now is make sure that those laws that violate the Principles which America was founded on gets repealed and that is the only way we can avenge the deaths of our soldiers who died to protect our freedom.

Vaccines trigger a reaction in your immune system. The immune system defeats this disease and  remembers how to defeat the same disease for next time. So when the same disease invades again, the immune system sends in the troops to deal with the disease.

 "The scans also showed that the princess had the bone infection osteomyelitis, Letyagin added. In addition, he said, the scans found evidence of injuries consistent with a fall -- perhaps from a horse.

To cope with the pain she must have been experiencing, the princess could have resorted to cannibis -- a container of the stuff having been found alongside the mummy in her burial chamber."

 True Islam is not sociopathic whatsoever.  




 Whats that?  




 *Extreme-right-wing-sociopathic-wahabi-let's-twist-up-Islam-for-our-own-gain- version-Islamic.* 




 By saying that it's not Islam related is just demonstrating how little you know about Islam. Islam decrees that any artifacts that predate Mohammed should be destroyed.  

I tried googling that but I found nothing. I will admit that my knowledge of Islam is not that of a scholar.

But I'll say this, if artifacts that predate Mohammed should be destroyed is truly a thing, and please cite as I couldn't find it, then during Mohammed's time, when he was alive, during the Abbasid and Umayyad Caliphates, then ancient sites that predated Mohammed would have ALREADY been destroyed. 

 




 Isolationism like after WW1 




 Ahhh, its part of maintaining their image as the protectors of Islam when in reality they are selling the loot to buy AK-47s.  And its working because the way people are viewing ISIS actions: not as looters that sell treasure and oil for AK47s  but as vandals that are destroying to protect religion.   Also, by skewing perception as Muslims are evil, their acceptance rate increases because westerners bully the Muslims causing them to leave and join ISIS.  

Edit: 
Its is plausable that meusium prices are catalogued thus you can't get very much because they are known about as a result easy to track. So they destroy them for propaganda. 

Also is it me or on their videos and pictures they are destroying bigger artifacts due to them being harder to smuggle?  




 I agree to an extent, it is to rationalize their twisted un-islamic religious beliefs.  




 Hipster millionaires wet dream! 




 Trust me its not Islam realated.  Religion is just a ruse for ISIS. Its all trickery not in the name of God but for Power. 

'"Conflict antiquities" are artifacts that are looted, smuggled and sold to illicit dealers around the world, with the proceeds going to fund military or paramilitary activity. Unesco estimates that globally trade in conflict antiquities could be worth more than $2.2 billion and growing as criminal groups recognize the value in very, very old things.'

"The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), which has taken over large swathes of land in Iraq and Syria, is selling ancient Iraqi artifacts in the black market to finance its military operations in the region, Iraqi and Western officials said."

 Who doesn't want a 2000 year old column on the front steps of their mansion?  




 Destruction of Palmyra is not because of Islam, if Islam is the reason then Palmyra world have been destroyed hundreds of years ago. ISIS is going to destroy Palmyra for the loot so they can finance their war machine. Its all a show for the west.

 When your country is underdeveloped, you need assistance from other people, usually they are from the west because that's where all the best universities are and that's why rich Asians send their kids to USA, Canada to study, when Cambodia devolps, they can take care of themselves.
