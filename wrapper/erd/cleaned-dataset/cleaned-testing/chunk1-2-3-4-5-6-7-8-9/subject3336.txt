 Holy Mother of God! They are sooo beautiful  




 I like Australis among the flaws that several have reported.  

One thing that totally breaks up the user experience is the sliding tab movement.  

What I've noticed it that is as long as the mouse pointer stays in the tab's area, then movement is smooth and perfect as usual; but the moment i go a bit down and over the Awesome bar or anything in vicinity, the drag movement abruptly stops.  
Honestly, its a total ruin because nobody can be so precise in maintaining the drag movement in such a small area.  

Please borrow idea from the competition and extend the drag-able area to the Awesome Bar also.  
Only then during fast browsing session can people feel the speed, mainly due to lack of disruption. 




 Ah yes, I did read about this, my Seagate cable has the usual plastic covering around it.  
I feel it was the driver problem though, after installing the proprietary drivers all seems fine :)  




 firefox creates a  new profile after install.  
better do the above mentioned method for fixing your problem. 




 Nightingale - though its a media player, it can browse the web too

 98 is just perfect!  
i really wish they rid of all the blue color for the icons, The original colors(Gold, greens etc.) have to be brought back.  
and i personally found the less curvy tabs more beautiful.  
Just wish they bring back what people need.   




 F1 cards 




 im installing it, do i need to uninstall the driver that comes along with fedora? if yes, do you know the package name?

EDIT-  
Ive installed(broadcom-wl;akmod-wl) and uninstalled nothing. Everything seems to be working fine and im able to connect my hard disk and browse for now :D :D :D   

THANK YOU! For your time and help! :D :D :D

Why cant the open source driver just be as good O_O?   




 I so wish they do this to DOWNLOADS. i hate a new window 




 yeah! :D i wish this gets implemented somehow 




 Sorry for the confusion  

i meant that an upward scroll of a few lines and "all the way up"scroll will reveal this toolbar menu.( if you use the new Facebook app you'll probably understand much easier) :)  

At the top position of the page the toolbar should be shown as default
 




 Since most of the highly used buttons of a browser are tucked away and accessing them requires more click or taps, i felt a disappearing toolbar area just like the way the new Facebook app does with 'Status|Photos|Activity' bar on the bottom would be great.  

Screenshot - https://imgur.com/Efav1kc

For  once you start scrolling down, it neatly hides its self, and only reveals when your are scrolling all the way up or are already at the top of the page.  
This way you still get back all the screen space and the most used buttons are always available to the users upfront. 




 unfortunately there is no debug file in b43 folder :/ 




 TouchPal is actually quite popular and free! Please do check it out :) 




 i've had this issue more profound on TouchPal keyboard. After i switched to SwiftKey, its kinda less, maybe RAM freed up?  




 its probably got to do with the google search suggestions thing.  
 




 1) I'm using the ones that came default with the Fedora install. I havn't modified the WiFi drivers in anyway so far.  
2) http://pastebin.com/4eL8pc9p

EDIT - the SSL thing is probably the https everywhere addon. And it include the normal browsing phase, HD connecting and internet inactive phase, and the back to normal phase once i disconnect the HD 




 1) 09:00.0 Network controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM4313 802.11bgn Wireless Network Adapter (rev 01)  
2) where do i find the logs to copy paste? 




 Wifi works on windows 7 after connecting the external HD.  
It seemed fine in ubuntu(long back) 




 ive got a seagate external usb hard disk and for some reason my Wifi stops working once i connect it. I browse through my android phone and the internet work super smooth at these times.
The current fix is only to disconnect the hard disk and continue browsing.  

Its a Dell N5110 15R system with Fedora 20 completely updated. Any way to fix this issue?   




 just try uninstalling/reinstalling the font support package via fedy itself. Fedy installs infinality http://www.infinality.net/ package for better font rendering. 




 i guess ill have to buy a new good phone without a physical menu button :D XD  

Yeah that's true, its just that it would be great if important buttons are laid out like the desktop version....hey! wait, is it possible to have a disappearing menu/button bar area, just like the new facebook app which has "status | photos | activity" that disappears while scrolling down and re-appears while upward scroll? 




  If the phone has a physical menu button, no menu should be displayed, unless the app has an outdated Manifest (might be the case for Twitter for all I know).  

Yeah that's it, the tradeoff between physical/virtual menu button. i feel it'll be best left to the user if he/she wants to enable the 3 dot menu button on phones with a physical menu button. 

i feel the most important buttons such as back, forward, refresh should be in a much more easily accessible location on the screen, instead of going through a menu.  


And thank you for the mention of gestures- will get an add on right away :D  

 




 on large screen phones, while holding it one hand, reaching the menu key to refresh or reload the page is painfully annoying.   
People need to shift the phone position just to do a simple refresh.  
And on large screen size phone's the 3 dot menu is not provided(due to design guidelines by google), but the Twitter app has still provided it. Some sort of fix or user choice enable/disable menu/custom button should be provided near the tab count icon. 




 The earth also, but we don't share it very well like the internet  




 Found that the twitter app on my phone has the menu option enabled - https://imgur.com/UfPwUUN

Guess sometimes user-experience comes first. 




 but at-least leaving an option in something like about:config would have helped lots of users out, instead of just disabling this menu button completely. :( 




 Its a Micromax A110 Canvas 2.
Yes it is has capacitive buttons on the bottom of the screen.

But the lack of a Soft-Menu button is a deal-breaker :(  
Since this is a phablet type(5-inches) device moving the finger from the screen to the bottom just to access menu button is quite frustrating. 

The FF team should have provided this option to the users to enable/disable the virtual menu button :( :(

Edit - runs on stock android jelly bean 4.1.1 




 I love it! 




 I Use the latest version Firefox Beta 29 (android) on a Micromax A110 Canvas 2 Device which runs on Jelly bean.  
I've noticed a three dotted menu button in various screen shots and other devices, but i do not have one :/  

Screenshot - https://imgur.com/cWb8yKn  

It kinda ruins the browsing experience because it is such a big phone and reaching down to access the capacitive buttons is totally a mess.  

Anyone know of a fix?   




 It is in the works, a project called Electrolysis

 happy to help! :) 




 well, if you have a no-history state, then you can pin in all the sites you enter the first few times. You can Drag and re-order them too.  

You can also pin the bookmarks by dragging and dropping them on any of the thumbnail.

Or maybe this add-on could help you - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tile-tabs/  
There 




 well copying of features works vice-versa in the open-source world.  
That's why good things spread and progress happens :)  

Custom tiles as in? 




 Great going! :) 




 The power that governments have these days can be misused.  
Take a look at Syria, Turkey, UAE, Saudi Arabia, China etc.  
Forget the internet in places like North Korea.  

This is the why Mozilla has taken a stand to support a free and open web among other things.  




 Over the past few year, so many policies and controlling measures have come in to the world on controlling internet usage.  

We have seen SOPA, PIPA, NSA, NETRA(india), CMS(India) etc. that have been proposed to control the flow of content and hamper sources over the internet.  
This Clearly breaks the foundation of free speech, privacy among various other issues.  

Please take a stand and Join the effort - http://mzl.la/QQRcMM

YOU are the change and YOU are in charge!  

Our voice maybe tiny but it definitely leaves an impact in the world community, which the internet truly is, a global one.  

NOTE - Though you may or may not be a user of the Firefox browser. Please consider sharing this piece of info of your fav. social networks!  
It is no way a campaign to download the latest Re-designed version of the Firefox Web Browser(but if you do download/use, thank you for keeping the community strong)   




 Beautiful 




 Felt the same way too :D 
Good move Mozilla by launching Firefox and this on the same day 














 I've made a newbie linux guide. Hopefully you should find it useful! :)  
https://test_subject3336.wordpress.com/2013/09/22/linux-a-newbie-desktop-users-guide/

Share it with your friends, family if you would like to. Peace! :) 




 oh, thats bad :/

But if someone could figure out something like the new linear loading bar, it would be awesome! ;) 




 Thanks a lot for help and time! :) 




 ah yes it is indeed an external mouse. i've used it before without problems, but probably some update package has caused this :/ 




 THIS IS SO GOOD :D  




 I've noticed when I access the Options to tap-click things likes sync, customize, Mozilla etc. there this certain animation of one screen closing and the tap-clicked option opening up.  
Thing is on low powered(512MB) devices, there is a noticeable lag while this switch takes place. 

Is there anyway to disable this animation? 




 Me too!  




 Im having an issue while using the scroll wheel on my mouse.
If im scrolling down a page, sometimes out of nowhere, it bounces lightly and scrolls upward a bit.
This is mighty frustrating on long webpages when, i have to go through this effect every few lines that get scrolled.
The mouse works perfect and I've tested it in windows too without any problems. 

Anybody have a solution? 









 i use the nightly and the beta, the rounded back button still doesn't seem to pushed into beta yet.  
Hope it comes soon, makes the interface equal and standard over different platforms. 




 like the new website idea a lot! :) 




 i initially thought it was a gnome desktop with lots of beautification. 









 http://imgur.com/sXoizoK

Mag lines travel in a particular direction, if im not wrong, so wont this cause and upward force, considering the force lines flow from bottom to top?  
this is what i meant, just wanted to know if its possible. 
 




 Well if that's the case, then keeping one magnet fixed and the other in a container above the stationary one, the magnet should float or hover right? 




 I'd like to know if magnets on their own or using some combo can produce repulsive force of order like 1000N or so? 
What factors hamper such things, like area, material etc?

 Twitter follows the emoji pack - https://twitter.com/Support/status/451399393850052610 




 i'm not seeing the Anti-Firefox page now.
But the damage has been done. A big one i believe. 




 Time to boycott OkCupid.
There are thousands of people who may or may not support the LGBT groups, but seriously WTF is it got to do with a non-profit that makes a pro-privacy browser?

Edit : They(OkCupid) have to publicly apologize and make up for all the lost Firefox users. 




 They should get sued!  









 You'll have the Segoe UI Symbol Fonts i guess 




 well, technology evolves.  
But yeah i agree, there isn't much consistency over these symbols on different platforms 









 Just found that these two packages are available for Emoji support for Fedora Linux - gdouros-symbola-fonts   google-android-emoji-fonts

Made a blog post to help stranded users - http://test_subject3336.wordpress.com/2014/03/29/emoji-on-fedora-linux/

Also color emoji support might come soon if Noto Color Emoji comes upstream 




 thanks a lot, i hope something similar exists on fedora :) 




 The logo instead of the 'O' in fox - awesome! :D 




 I get these  - boxes with number's when i see an Emoji. Is is because im on Linux or is it the browser issue?  
Some of them are rendered pretty though. 




 Good Going! I Just hope more people are aware about this project! :D 














 ah yes, just saved the the top result on google ^ _ ^ ' 









 yeah thats also nice! :D

Though i love the whole shift to Australis, the issues above are worth pondering and acting upon 




 www.nsa.gov 




 The Direction looks stunning in the trailer 




 oh okay :)
Ive been trying to solve an issue involving these option, so just wanted to know if there was a manual page.  
Thanks! :) 




 This is the newer version that works for me(Some inconsistencies are present):

    @namespace url(http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul);

        #urlbar {-moz-appearance: none !important; background-color: #FFFFFF; border-radius: 20px !important;}
        #search-container textbox {-moz-appearance: none !important; border-radius: 20px !important;}

Edit - The code lines posted by @shortkey work perfectly on Firefox for Windows.  
The above lines are for Linux versions of Firefox 




 hey can i know from where you find out parameters like #urlbar and its associated options? 




 Nothing is. NSA clearly has an upper hand now.  
All we as common people do is enforce encryption in the services we use.  
It only increases computation time to break codes then. 




       they have to be manually changed I guess.
 
 Yes this would be most serious roadblock. Also I am not sure if different drivers would be available for these totally different kind of old hardware presen

Installing Linux takes 10 Minutes. Legacy Hardware support is quite good. 




 If its new Machine orders, manufacturers take care of preloaded OS.  
If its in use they have to be manually changed I guess. Once the switch is made OTA updates are possible to upgrade Linux Distro's.

Survival of Fittest.  




 Distro Dev's are contributors to Kernel Codes. 




 The post was about Linux not Unix. Out of the blue a Unix Kernel talk came and its reached so far. I'm done talking.

Have a Good Day.  




 Error Reports dont just go out in the name of UNIX. It goes back to the developers(Here apple and FreeBSD).
If its somebody else who developed the UNIX variant, it goes back to them. 




 Please go use a new good Linux Platform, you'll understand the way in which bugzilla works these days by auto uploading your bug-reports, even without you providing any details of the bug. All you need to provide is your email and password during the initial setup of the bug reporting tool.  

SER as you says only collects and gives to Micro - true, but whats the use if you pay for an OS that doesn't fix your problem??? Why are people wasting $ on a company that chooses if it has to fix your problem or not?  

This whole topic was on Linux and Windows.  
I did mention a bit above that Linux and Unix are two different things.
 




 This whole forum was on Linux.  

And as for Unix, FreeBSD a variant of it does the above. Also does Mac OS X which is a derivative of Unix, they do it well too. 




 It does, it does!

My error was on my end, not the mechanism 




 Damn you've got to be kidding me.  

Linux has Bug report systems like ABRT, Bugzilla. And they do a Better job than Send Error Report(which i haven't seen fix any errors).  

I dont know if you mean Autodesk 3ds Max, Maya, CATIA  as poorly designed apps. But ive got a heck load of problems when i used to work with them. 

And as for so called "unix distros don't have any central company to supply updates"  
Maybe you should use Ubuntu or Fedora and see how wonderful they handle updates.(That includes core kernel updates without breaking the system).
Also you're able to Upgrade the entire OS to the latest version from these central repositories. 

I use windows for my gaming, i love it for that. Its the only place it shines.  For work its Linux, because its reliable and stays solid

 









 Since Fedora is a community based Distro, i feel it'll be great to have some feedback from them itself for the Fedora Project to be leaders again in the Free Linux OS field.

I've been using Linux dating long back to Redhat Linux 7 and onwards.
There have been amazing changes. Since ive used Linux so long, its real hard for me to go back to my Windows OS.

Here are few areas i feel Fedora Project need to pay more attention to:

1. Looks:  
We have all the icons and everything is symbolic. Its perfect. But where it lacks is that its not aesthetically pleasing. People always tend to judge a product by its finish and looks. One amazing example here is Apple - Im sure most mac buyers don't go into the details of the OS or its usage and purpose, but just give into the looks of the product. The color palette needs a refresh i feel. 
Currently its functional not pleasing (from the eyes of a normal user)

2. Tutorials:  
We need to provide the common user an OFFICIAL source of Text and Video based tutorial regarding things like installation, Music, Movies, App Installation etc. It should be clean and no Gimmicks. And the best way to host them would be TORRENTS! 

3. Default Packages:  
This is one part im a bit sad about. Previous version of Fedora came with the big guns of open source like GIMP, games etc. but most of it is removed these days. 
Normal people wont want all the other packages(they consider it junk) just like all the those preloaded android phone apps from manufacturer's.

4. Do NOT scare the new user   
New users Judge a product within 30 seconds i feel. If they feel its complex, they leave, if its too simple, they question and wonder. Just provide what is needed. FAQ are the best way to address.

5. Bug Reports  
This is daunting for a new user. They go through this unknown thing called ABRT, then Bugzilla, (GOD WHAT's Happening :O) They have been scared to death already now. We need to simplify this process. And make them understand how things work on the open source end.

6. Customization  
This was what Linux is all about.  
Fedora needs to point users to where they can find new content like themes, icons (that's what a normal user cares to find)  

7. Proprietary Package  
I know this is the No! NO! but normal user eventually need them for their Graphic Cards etc. The community should make people understand that its OK for them to install but the packages are responsibility of the company providing them. A video might help clear the air. 

8. Media, Formats etc  
Another important area where we should educate users that they can watch their favorite movies, or listen to songs in Open Source Formats, BUT, since half the world moves on mp3, avi etc, options are always available to install player like VLC etc.

9. Social Media  
Maybe the open world doesn't agree with Facebook but that's where users are and that's where users share their content. We need to make a definite presence.

10. Presentation  
Easy to understand, clean and visually beautiful. Hit them right and i guess the world will start following.

We have YouTube/Torrents to share all this Tit-bits of knowledge for free!

Do share in  your views! :)

 









 I would like the make the Awesome bar rounded on the ends, also the Search bar. How can this be done? I've looked into add-ons, sadly didn't find any.   




 Thanks for the update to the nightly channel.

The white outline surrounding the icons, like the bookmarks, home etc. really help visibility! :D. Hope it comes to the actual release!

If you guys could just make the close button rounded like the new "back" navigation icon, it'll just be an epic win!

Go Australis! 









 Does anyone know what's the difference between drivers provided by Intel graphics installer and the original ones that come with the distribution? 




 I used a fully updated Fedora 20 Distro on a laptop with an Nvidia 525M Card. Its Optimus technology based.
I've read that kernel 3.13 comes with inbuilt power management features, so do i need bumblebee here after?
I've tried uninstall and reinstall the packages and drives using "yum reinstall bumblebee bbswitch bumblebee-nvidia" to no avail.
Anybody else here in the same boat?
*the bbswitch package was updated to ver. 8 




 I've noticed that firefox always needs to download the persona to display after launching the browser, this might be (just) okay on the desktop but on mobile its quite a resource hog and slows the start up performance of the browser.
There is a severe lag, when the connection is slow.

Why cant it be stored in the SD-Card or the Hard disk and be loaded straight from there?   




 i would like to know about your favourite clients on xmms2, do you still use the old or the new version and much more, Considering these were(or maybe still is) the best music player Linux will ever have!
To the Devs of xmms2 - please a standard out-of-the-box GUI _/\_ 




 Here's the link to the trailer - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrudC0STJ0U

Its not on the Soundtrack of the film :( It comes from some other source.

From a post on last.fm i found a few words of the lyrics

The lyrics appear to be -- "don't you worry ... about the flight yeah ..." ... "careful and true... we've flown..." ..."sing for the way we've grown... we grow..."
last.fm post -  http://www.last.fm/forum/5/_/527438

It might be an Australian band too, the film comes from Australia.
 



















 how do i know what chords can be played with what notes? I mean to ask if there is any rule that states that so and so notes and only be played using these chords?
And also how do i develop my chord knowledge. Thanks! 





























 i've put up a logcat long back on the page.
What more info is needed? i'll try to provide max details :) 




 i've tried all, beta, stable and nightly...but its still present. Hoping it gets resolved soon :) 




 i did try it out, still a major WIP but a real good effort :D 




 ah yes, very true that opera handles much of the processing on the server side.  

But i've had extremely good browsing experience on both dolphin and the stock android browser. I feel they dont disapper off because they are very lightweight in nature.   

If Firefox has just a bare browser thing on android, it would be awesome.

4.1.1 device here :)   




 it actually doesnt involve particular pages.
For eg. scrolling through general sites like Facebook, Complex just close the browser down. (i did file a bugreport on this issue - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1041968)  

Heavily noticed this happening while scrolling when the page is loading. 




 I've noticed a lot on low RAM devices(=512), the browser just disappears after a light usage run. I mostly suspect an Out of memory situation is the cause of it.  

But if a really light version like the something in the likes of a opera mini version happens then firefox can surely run stable on low end mobile hardware. 




 https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1056875 




 i think its the problem with this new switching graphics tech.  
Hopefully someone will give a solution :) 




 Song to Siren - Candy soundtrack 




 ah nope
only H-title, video downloadhelper and downthemall 




 i've tried chrome, and things remain almost constant.  
I've tried on fresh profile, and all addons and plugins disabled.  
Guess ill open a bug report.   




 i really have a strange GPU issue while using firefox.  
My system dell n5110 has an Intel i3 and nvidia 525M optimus(Hybrid) running with bumblebee(Proprietary drivers) on Fedora Linux 20  
Every time i use Firefox, the GPU fan goes on and off over and over after a certain time of operation.  
My normal laptop temp is around 48-54C but when i use the browser its slowly rises above 60.  
The Processor clock jumps from 101MHz-1200MHz  
The Graphics clock jumps from 50MHz-600Mhz  

I've tried switching off Hardware Acceleration but this still happens.   









 thanks a lot for your time :) _/\_ 




 there's a lot of speculation that it could be Shirley Mansion of garbage 




 ah its not, song to the siren is a different one :/ 




 The song appears in the candy trailer - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrudC0STJ0U  
The songs appears at 1:15  
Most believe its some unknown Australian Song.  
It's not present on the OST.  

Few of the words in the songs are:  
don't you worry  
about the flight yeah  
careful and true... we've flown  
sing for the way we've grown... we grown  
 




 thanks a ton, _/\_ it sounded so familiar!
i've listened a lot to this and yet it slipped away from my head  




 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtIzADkd504

Could anyone let me know the song playing in the background? 




 This post should be stickied 




 lib-ray-off-is 









 Instabug, you guys should get intouch with Facebook, their android app kinda seems like hopeless now. 




 your issue is strange, try browser reset or new profiles (proceed with caution to back up data first).  
And check for updated sound card drivers.  
Incase its still faulty, then please do file a bug report.  

EDIT- webm and vp9 are implemented in Firefox but still needs smoothing out. So if youtube is serving you in these formats, then thats most likely the problem. 




  che, the issue disappears. But it appears again in a while.
 
 I should mention that I am usi

do you have mediasource enabled in about:config? 




 if you're on the stable release, try reinstalling flash and see.  
it looks more of a connection problem.  

If you feel its a browser problem, then try clearing cache.  
Still plauged with the problem, try a browser reset or a new profile.   




 your issue on linux? 




  #tabbrowser-tabs tab:not([selected="true"]) .tab-close-button {
  display: none !important;}

Hey thanks @shortkey :D :D :D
i just needed to change display: inline :D 




 try clear cache? 




 but i guess voting can bring about a perspective on the yays and nays of new features(mainly UI changes).  
Core technologies should be done as per firefox devs, which is much better in their hands.

 




 https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=856427 




 Why does the close button have to disappear just after 8 tabs?  
Its kinda annoying. Chrome allows upto 18 tabs with the close button present.  

Im kinda sure people have more than 8 tabs opens in a normal browsing session.  
Pic - http://imgur.com/01Eop1T  

Anybody know of a permanent way on keeping them on? 




 All the best to the new man!  
Hope we sail strong through the internet! 




 i guess a simple webpage where people vote yes/no on a new ui change or so could be an easy task for Mozilla, and better for Firefox progress as well. 




 Browser - firefox  
Arts - blender, Inkscape and GIMP  
Audio video - audacious, VLC, Winamp  




 Honestly changes are great as it happens.  
But then there are certain ones which are kinda very different, and need a lot of talking back and forth and agreeing to.  
For eg. the tab screen is really starting to look weird in nightly :/  
Is there any such forum or place where normal people can interact with the firefox development community? 




 also the rounding
 









 Lots of unticks on Chrome and Firefox even when they do support different things. 
 




 search for this 'media.mediasource.enabled' and enable it in about:config.  
its still a bit buggy when playing vp9 encoded videos - plays fine thought -test it out. you might like it.   

edit - To check if its on visit http://www.youtube.com/html5 




 if you really want to take some extreme steps delete the .mozilla folder in your home directory.  
Im also a fellow Fedora user with 2 Firefox versions, stable and nightly, and both are working fine for me.   




  d the Google Talk Plugin, and I've installed NoScript consistently with each new profile.
 
 Fair point though, a bit of digging says SIGABRT is triggered by angry libraries? I'll tinker with profiles (add-ons) in mind. Thanks. 

ill suggest a totally non-addon approach first on new profiles. check if that helps.
Or else remove it via yum and reinstall and see if that helps 




 Thats true. But I've faced similar playback issues on Vimeo as well.
The content would have already streamed ahead by the player will start playing for a few seconds, stop and if it wish continue playing more or until i click the play button again.  

Also the loading(buffering) bar keeps going out of its limits into infinity and beyond.
 









 sadly chrome is much smoother in video playback on linux 




 Try a complete system update and reboot or Try reset the browser.
If thats not helping create a new profile. 




 i would include all video sites in general. 




 codec for playing most web content - http://www.openh264.org/ 




 its happening on both Youtube and vimeo for me. Can't make a switch.  
HTML5 here we come! 




 ah the kernel 3.15.4-200.fc20.x86_64  
and Fedora 21 is still away

EDIT- GNOME yes they havnt updated, they'll be pushing it out on the next version with wayland support 




 oh okay, not much familiar. i'll just shut my mind :| 




 But pretty much everyone installs them anyway, because otherwise your video players don't work.

thats true, but i guess mozilla is trying for an out of box working option.  


and also, i think might be better if a software runs with its own set of stuff, than pulling stuff from the OS every now and then 




 i guess most distro's don't ship the bad and ugly versions of gstreamer.  
Also Windows tech is proprietary  




 i saw this after the latest update 




 Thanks for the link! :) 




 Fedora 20  
Gnome 3.10.2 




 Seriously wish it had a fill background option too. 




 and thank you guys for making a great browser! :D

 Is it possible to extend a persona theme as a complete background onto the speed dial area? Im not wanting a background addon that allows me to choose a background image, but something that just utilizes the persona theme itself or the colors in it to give a good back ground 



















 You just need this and all's good https://www.google.com/tools/dlpage/hangoutplugin

 




 Do try out the beta or nightly version. They kinda work better than the stable version for me.File bugs too when crashes happen. 




 It has performed much better in recent times but things like chrome displaying the page as soon as it loads, kind of create a better illusion of speed.
Things need to feel very smooth for the users.
Even the tab movement area is much smoother and of larger area in chrome that in Firefox. Miss the area and you create a new window while reordering the tab. 




 maybe chrome might use google dns built in(not sure).

But since the android app is also not working, it needs to be a DNS issue. Bombard BSNL! xD 




 the instances ive got crash reports, ive submitted, but this as you found out was different  




 thank you for the link! :D 




 yes...you too? 




 Sad state :/  
something good needs to be done to thwart that drm cancer. 




 hmm probably true, i use like a normal user, i'll have apps that maybe running in the background without me knowing also.

ill shall try find the log file and submit soon 




 I don't see how Shumway will allow Firefox to get users back. Most people don't exactly use Flash voluntarily. They need it because video sites require use of patented codecs (H264) and DRM.

Linux users are fed up with Adobe flash(no new versions-except security updates), and most crashes happen due to flash or some flash based content on webpages. Plus lots of people use YouTube and other video based sites a good part of usage, having something inbuilt and stable like shumway like the way Google does with Pepper, it should probably improve the reliability of the browser. 




  Can you please file bugs about these issues? This sounds really strange, should absolutely not happen, and we don't know of any current issues like that. Do you have some task killer or anything installed that's nuking Firefox while it runs?

Sure i shall file a bug, but i just have no content to attach to a report sadly :/
It'll just close down without any message while browsing. And i dont use any task killer.
 
 It already uses very little memory, and will work well on any Android phone with as little as 384M RAM (Firefox uses FAR FAR less, but your other apps will eat up most of that!).

i do know it does uses very less, but when other apps are also present, then things get slow, like using swiftkey, whatsapp, facebook and firefox one after the other :/
  




 i think some DNS server is at fault.  
Unless someone fixes it, it'll be the same situation for people who are routed through that server or ISP.  

The bigger problem is that YouTube is not aware of this issue. Some thing similar happened to WhatApp users in india connected to a particular ISP. Only after the social media and news exploded was the service fixed.  

People need to inform YouTube about the issue! Attack Social Media! 




 Hats off to the developer community for all the work they've done all these years. Truly, its been a great product. And i keep hoping for more good stuff from you guys! _/\_ MASSIVE RESPECT    

A little focus on more important things will probably show a positive change eventually. It will take time to fight back whats lost to chrome, but im sure a good number of them will be Firefox users who are wanting to come back to where they felt at home before.   

I guess Firefox also needs to increase its social media presence, Google can do it for Chrome through their ads system, but Firefox has to fight it out without spending much on Facebook, Twitter etc.

Once Firefox fixes up electrolysis and Shumway, that coupled with the privacy, peace of mind and the add on ecosystem, it will be a great combo to make some groundbreaking ad to get back whats lost, and add more new users.  

it will take time, but these should be worked on with a great pace now, coz time costs everything these days.   




 i agree the attitude of the common man is hopeless.  

only few of us try to make a valid change. I try a lot to convince people to shift to Firefox. Some do but others just stick it to the other competition because it works out of the box and without any trouble.  

I still feel Firefox has every chance to grab back the market it lost, if it starts focusing on the current basic essentials to web browsing.  

Back to square one is the need of the hour. 




 i feel the browser should focus on delivering speed, lower memory usage, per Tab process and shumway.  

Honestly i don't think normal people do care if a browser is super developer friendly with all the features it provides; The general crowd wants the content or webpage to load super fast and with very little to no problems.  

I've tired Firefox Beta on Android and the Nightly versions too, but there are lots of performance issues, when compared to others in the market. Ive got lots of instances when the browser will just close without even a Crash Pop-up to send an error report.  
Plus Firefox Mobile needs to make use of less resources(RAM etc.) of low end phones, since most of them are 512 MB RAM mediatek chipsets.

Its been a really long wait from the browser that was a game changer back then :( 




 i think its a DNS issue, lots of people are facing this, but in certain locations, or based on the browser.  

Cause chrome is able to go through. But the YouTube android app is totally failing to play and same with Firefox.  

Using google dns solves this problem :D
YouTube or your ISP(im not sure whom) has to fix this problem.  

https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/

 




 enabled as default. still no change on Firefox PC version.  

i've also noticed that the android YouTube is also failing to play videos.  
This is totally weird, since its working perfectly on chrome(desktop).   




 same issue, works on chrome.
latest nightly build. FF33.0a1 Linux 




 same state unfortunately :/  
But please do spread the news if you can to others who could help out. :)    

Lots of apps have language support problems because there not enough user contribution   




 i also have a horrible problem on vimeo, where the video stars playing, streams ahead but the player automatically stop and ive got to hit the play button again. Very annoying!
Linux Build.  




 Since the keyboard is now free and everyone can download from the Google Play Store, it would be great to have Malayalam language support for those like typing in Malayalam on their smartphones.

Kindly contribute to testing if you could. Or spread the message!

i hope Shumway comes through fast.  
But then all sites have this problem to a varying extent, leaving me totally clueless on what/why its happening :( 




 yeah, they had been horrible with kernel support.  
hope that will change soon for the better 









 I've been noticing this for quite some time now, video's even though fully loaded tend to stutter a lot during playback.
It was more profound on vimeo, when the playback stop and the video  button changes from the pause button to play button. The video was fully loaded though - http://vimeo.com/48043470 - this was the video, while this thing was happening.  

Its also present on facebook videos, though to a lesser extent, and least on YouTube.  


I played the same vimeo video in another browser(chrome) and it was playing very well, even while streaming without any stutters.

Fedora 20 Linux, Latest Updated Nightly. 




 Well, it's like an iTunes clones visually, with support for themes and add-ons. It's good for managing music when you have a large library. It's got SoundCloud, last.fm integration among others. Auto scrolling lyrics support. And the most important of all, it still works as a browser.  
I use it and am definitely happy. Of course there are minor bugs here and there bug for a normal user I don't think it'll be a problem.

  't been fixed yet, along with some tab-tearing and tab-pinning visualization, when Australis is all about "beauty" and "sleek-ness". I guess it's because Firefox ships with tabs on top by default, which makes the lack of this "tab sliding movement" almost unnoticeable (or less painful) in maximized state, because you can just press your pointer against the top of your monitor and when moving the tab (that is

It is however a pain on Gnome shell, because on the main panel on the top, so even if you move up a bit, your off the main firefox window, and eventually create a new Firefox window.

 Firefox is getting its own flash like chrome by a project called Shumway. It's being worked on.  









 Thank you :) That seems like a fine solution, but it would have been nice if the favicon could be used as a thumbnail pic.  




 im wondering if you could replace the tile screenshot's on the new tab page with something like the site's logo or so? Is there any way? Because it kinda seems privacy intrusive when people can actually see image content of sites like facebook and the like, when you open a new tab.  

Also i've noticed most elements are not captured in the screen shot, its like some content has been captured and show and the rest where ignored/left out.

You can follow the progress here https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=778617  

If you find your issue very unique or specific to some url, please do file a bug-report. As far i can tell you youtube/vimeo videos play, but with issues at times. 




 thats true :), but since this app doesnt do something out of the box and several other facebook and twitter clients work just fine, i dont understand why its a big problem for them to optimize for the lower end.  
FB plans to put itself everywhere, then it should concentrate that its a problem free experience on mobile. 




 it is kitkat minimum requirement. i've got a higher Ram phone. Just that FB app was never optimized to run on lower end

Edit - all the other apps ran very fine, and i noticed once i got rid of the facebook app, my phone was much faster and smoother 




 If your phone is 512mb ram. Have a good day on using it smoothly or more importantly without closing  




 very true, i was just mentioning the javascript stuff.  
i'd really love more battery efficiency. Most browsers usage does give a sure hit. 




 Even if u take benchmarks, it recently beat everyone at their own benchmark index.

 Press and hold the link - pop-up menu appears - Select open with app 




 still unable to sort photos according to date creation :( but date loaded onto device 




 i have a STRONG feeling this is because of the FACEBOOK app.  
Even on my old micromax a110 512mb ram device this happened when facebook was installed.  

Once i uninstalled my facebook app, phone was butter smooth.  
Same thing with the Moto G 2ng Gen.   

EDIT - not on the forums. but you could try this out and just report it there to help us ALL!

 You should probably try the beta or the normal stable version. Nightlies are test oriented

 actually lots of site including news.google.com look weird with chrome's rendering mechanism.  
Thanks :) but I've tried that extension, it helps to a little extent. 




 chrome only - http://imgur.com/6sv8BWE 




 is there any way to improve font rendering in chrome on linux? 
its so bad, jagged. Some sites are beautiful but most are just meh. 




 audacious for music - with xmms theme

 i guess yes!

 ah that means you need a dark adwaita theme or the gtk3 firefox version(under development) 




 Op's GNOME theme - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/adwaita/ 




 kinda yes - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/themes/

Edit: i guess it'll replace your adwaita theme - not sure 




 You could do away with the color problem by installing a Persona(lightweight themes) of your own choice after installing the HTitle add-on

 ah yes i get what your trying to say :)  
i have a couple of emoji font installed on my system to help me out.  
I just felt this could be better since the user doesn't need to do any-end work 




 ah i've noticed on http://getemoji.com/ that you can copy paste emojis from there. 
Its the way i do currently on Firefox when i need to add some emoji. 




  and paste as if they were regular text which is a shame. Another option is to not use these and include a web font 

ah i dont quite understand, maybe im wrong here, but its really easy to copy-paste emoji's from http://getemoji.com/  
Just select and copy! :)

Font support is good, but colors are still an issue. Since this seems like it has SVG support, it can work quite well i guess.

Third option is actually what i felt would be good, cross platform OS based or software based support.  
Since Firefox doesn't have a way to input emojis directly into text fields, i felt this could do very well for those who want emoji inputs. 









 im not sure of the emoji one thing - recently stumbled across it.  
But if its not supported then fall back to ":smile:" for 
Thing is if this is implemented at an OS font or so, end users don't have to go searching for fonts etc. 




 i see a lot of emoji hate, but its much better to have something than those black boxes everywhere. 




 ah i guess i saw an SVG implementation on their github.  
Also since this can be used as a standard cross-platform Emoji Support since its open-source(CC    MIT license),based on Unicode, and thus help in correct rendering of Emoji's.  
Good for the users i guess :) 









 This will actually be a boost to both parties.  
Lots of users can get around internet censorship with Tor quite easily. 




 Use the Tor Browser Bundle - you get everything of Tor, Firefox and free access 




 May this come super soon! _/\_

According to rumours(NOT Confirmed) - "it revolves around five persons, a model (Amy Jackson) a doctor(Upen Patel) and three other people who get affected by a poisonous chemical. Reports add Chiyaan(Vikram) will sport a look which will depict a person with his face affected by such chemical."  

Its a teaser, so the plot is still off.

 try looking for a proprietary driver, if the open sourced one is at fault.

http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Drivers/b43
http://www.broadcom.com/support/802.11/linux_sta.php

One of these should help your situation :)

Edit:- i searched more through the interwebs:
Enable RPM Fusion repo, or install them if you havn't
Try doing a "yum install kmod-wl" 

 




 Try LiLi. Worked best in my experience http://www.linuxliveusb.com/ 




 im not sure, might be a stupid guess too, but if your network card has a proprietary driver you could try install that and see if your thing works.  Check in windows or so to know your manufacturer  

Also you could try disabling IPv6 support and see if you find some luck  

Edit: Try ifup and ifdown to switch individual cards.

 lspci can list out all the detected cards etc. 




 i really wish the variable stroke path width comes in fast to Inkscape.

It's of real and great importance to people who draw and illustrate on the computer 




 whats you said is true too, since people use their mobile devices a lot to type online, the emoji habit will also show up in text fields. 




 ah, i guess, in your case the system is missing the Segoe UI font or some other emoji color/noncolor supported font; which is why you're seeing boxes 









 :) you're welcome 




 i think this might be website enabled - http://www.fileformat.info/info/emoji/browsertest.htm  

Still black and white; colored ones are images.  
Why didnt emoji's get made in SVG?

EDIT:
Also
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji

Edit 2:
I think its because you are on Windows and have a color emoji support font installed on the system, My Linux system still shows b w :/ 




 twitter did mention on a tweet long back that they started supporting color emoji's 




 that write up is just brilliant! hahaha xD 




 Firefox's edge is with the add-ons it has, thats one thing millions of users love. But yes e10s is highly needed to have that edge over chrome again.  

Sometimes i feel e10s should have been a much higher priority in the past itself. FF wouldn't have lost out a good amount of users to chrome. Also risking the add-ons will be a blow to the already using FF users. I think with proper co-ordination and fast paced interaction within the Firefox community can make both e10s and add-on compatibility a great success.  

http://arewee10syet.com/ -- the working add-on list shows good promise, even though there are lots of buggy ones and non tested ones too. 




 my dog starts barking loud! its like he's yelling around im hungry im hungry!  




 get the spice fire one - has an additional camera, and feels better from the youtube reviews too 




 ah yes, and once the update comes through, same issue.  
Tried new profiles and reset.  
my goto method on linux was disable the e10s autostart on launch thing in about:config and delete the updates folder and relaunch. Somehow it used to update.  

Now it doesnt though :( 




 so it wasnt just me on linux O_O 









 Im sorry to hear that you're having troubles with Firefox.  
I've been using firefox since it's version 1.0+ days.  

My best guess is that you try out to get the latest stable version. Incase you've had it installed, try a browser reset or start a fresh profile.

 krita is mainly meant for the artists, GIMP was like the OSS response to photoshop.  




 Driver 2 




 i use both gimp and inkscape alternatively as a combo :) 




 the ones ive mentioned are mostly GNU GPL licensed and FOSS 




 http://test_subject3336.wordpress.com/2013/09/22/linux-a-newbie-desktop-users-guide/ 




 Firefox, GIMP, Inkscape, Blender, Fedora Linux, Ubuntu Linux, Audacity, Krita, Birdie, Pidgin IM, Audacious, FBReader,  VLC  

Edit -  forgot Libreoffice 




 could you try some other browser and see something similar is happening or not? 




 it could also be your OS downloading updates in the backgroud.  

in case its on mobile, you can restrict background data usage on android in Data usage settings.   


































 can you provide some info on the black bars in Frames?  
I dont know if its common to everybody but, hitting next on Every photo in an album on facebook always results in disk activity and also scrolling down the news feed for stories in the past also leads to disk activity. 




 Yes, because they develop it and test it out for maximum performance with chrome. 




 Yes, chrome does play html5 YouTube much better and smoother, because they implemented it first and launched it. Now everybody else is playing catch-up. Sick marketing move.  




 i still feel Flash is horrible on chrome. It does play better than Firefox on Linux but it takes a couple or more of "refresh" page to get the video to load in the first place.  
im hoping that these sites convert once html5 video gets a little more traction.  
And yes the awful works-on-Chrome mentality is more than bearable these days _ 




 Yeah true but kinda feels bad that people still mention it as if he was forced to resign and they are using that as a reason to abandon :(  
Hope they get some sense into their heads soon and firefox goes far ahead from the current catch-up situation.
 




 most news channels/popular sites still use some form of flash player :/  
i wish they convert 




 eh? Java works fine on all my OS's. Whats your issue? 




 Strange, people are still talking of the Brenden Eich issue. :/  
Mozilla needs to address this again.  




 emojione is trying to address these issues.  
they could probably make a font with the work they have done but that hasnt happened yet.  
they welcome devs to use all the content that is open-sourced  - http://emojione.com/  




 so far gimp in comparison to PS.  
Other than that krita, mypaint, inkscape, synfig  




 Apple emojis are proprietary.  
The only open sourced emoji I've known so far is Google's, and emojione.com  
Emoji One is a better answer than both of them,  but is Web based.  
Edit -  Firefox does support emoji, you might be missing the font files on your system. Get the symbola font from unicode or segoe ui if your on windows 8 




 This isn't an animation software :/  
SynFig could help you 




 okay even more recent(as far as possible) xD - https://twitter.com/OrmrTheEditor 




 they are active here though - https://www.facebook.com/OrmrTheEditor

 if its real bad, i think you have to reset your browser or create a new profile. back up before proceeding.

 Broke my heart :'( , Linux is secondary everywhere  




 its so beautiful  




 You'll have to wait on the white page, I get it too, the site loads fine after the small wait.  
If it doesn't I think it's because of connection trouble  









 Few things come with a user manual these days. Many people struggle using a smart phone. Too much clutter and confusion. 









 Ah true, people are influenced by what they see around them, but devs could have a final say on the matter  




 The right click isn't an issue, it the way it should work.   
If you've high end cad programs like catia or so, it's right click everywhere  




  The problem is with the open source community is that they too content with what they have, they don't see lack of good GUI tools on Linux a problem because they use the command line anyway

Dont feel that way, we wanted Office, we've got LibreOffice and OpenOffice.  We wanted a alternative to 3ds max/Maya(though maya runs on Linux) we got blender and its going places. Alternative to Autodesk Sketchbook, we've got Krita and MyPaint. Corel Draw/Illustrator - Inkscape, SynFig.  
There is an abundance of good software, i'll admit some of these having a learning curve but they are worth the time spent!   
The community has never kept quiet, we've kept demanding, its just the commercial bigshots are ignorant, and the community had to figure out its own version of things.

Maybe you could ask people here or at /r/linux or similar sub reddits for help? Collab with people on git hub if you like? 




 and it will positively impact the Linux culture and base if its picked up and worked upon.  Many people just wish Photoshop runs on Linux so that they could convert. That hasn't happened so far. :/  
The open source community is good, just that sometimes, things are out of focus or pressing issues are not addressed 




 oh okay! Awesome :) 




  Contests for UI and UX do not work (that is what "everyone feels qualified to criticize the UI and suggest improvements" would be). 

i think if mock-ups are shown to the public or demo-ed, then people can vote on the best implementation.  
Also people who have a better concept should be given consideration and voted along with the other concepts.  
GIMP has quite a long release cycle, so this should be possible.

 




 yup!  
I just wish changing opacity, brush size, colors, could be done on the go. Krita does an almost amazing job at this. A artist who's drawing something doesn't have to constantly switch between the keyboard and tablet/mouse much. 




 true, but i feel blender provides more co-ordination while using that rule, and you don't have to remember most of the commands or dig the menu's, the space bar/search gives everything!   




 and the new engine :D! 




 just to clarify, i meant a wacom drawing tablet :) 




 Ah yes I agree about the issues with preview  




  vector  
I guess it's a typo 

GIMP ui currently is way better than what Blender was in the initial days. But blender has picked up, polished it self and has a much better UI today but the most important thing is that it's still Blender.  
There is a learning curve to both these software's, but something about UI/UX is important to have a really smooth work flow.  
Love blenders rule - one hand on keyboard and one on mouse  









 No love for Russia? 




 if you have a tablet, you can sketch using the pencil tool.  
Afterwards use the node tools, simply the path(Ctrl+L), and keep tweaking and adjusting!   




  We'll help you to flesh out your idea and promote it to a larger community. 

Okay that felt awesome to read! :D  
I think with some proper co-ordination this could be possible and hopefully big! 




 MSE is quite usable on the Nightlies for sometime now. Some bugs are left and some new ones pop up too, so unless every known issue is dealt with its better to keep them in testing.  
Would also be a negative backlash when you ship something thats only partially working 




 xD well something can be done to make it non-capitalistic  




 Yes but the scale has been low I feel :/ 




 I believe contributors will show up, because most people don't want to shell out huge $ on a legal version of Photoshop. If there's an alternative that works just as good, then it's well worth contributing something for such a cause.  
The UI could use a fix, many other features can be smoothened out, yes Photoshop and Gimp are different, that should remain, but there are things like cmyk etc. that still haven't happened. A drive like this should enable users to vote on a set features they want to see implemented in time frame.  




 oh yeah :/ missed that.  
But still the possibility of such an event would be wild and awesome  




 Yup true! But i guess the team could also use the money to hire part time/full time programers for the project  




 I've outline a few steps normal user's can take up to ensure that their privacy is protected with the different softwares one uses on a computer or smartphone.  
Here the link [Short Guide on Privacy/Safety tech for your Browser, Smartphones and OS](https://test_subject3336.wordpress.com/2015/02/26/short-guide-on-privacysafety-tech-for-your-browser-and-os/)  
Do read and please leave your feedback here or on the page :)  
Hope it helps! 




 Yes very true! Many people I've known would want to use gimp, but they aren't very comfortable once they start using. If a campaign to fund and improve gimp happens then I guess lots of contributions will pour in.  
Especially the fact being it's open source and free!  




 We all know that there is no Photoshop on Linux and I dont think Adobe has any plans to make one.    
GIMP is the best thing available but IMHO it hasn't reached that level of perfection we would like. Yes, it does a lot of things Adobe can do and sometime even better but theres a feel that something's missing.    
Krita another OSS app went for a successful Kickstarter funding recently(https://krita.org/item/krita-2-9-0-the-kickstarter-release/) and its helped the software and the community pretty well.  
Im sure lots of users out there would like GIMP to reach the top, many want a true Photoshop alternative thats simple to use and looks good.  
What are your thought /r/gimp ?  Wouldn't such a funding campaign help GIMP progress as the app we want? 




  Am I just pulling stuff out my ass or do you guys notice a correlation  

ah well its true, but i dont think because its because they are branded as OSS. Its mostly the look of the app, and the ease of usability that matters to an end user.     




 Yes! i wish GIMP also goes with some move like this!  
We could possibly have a perfect alternative to Photoshop!

 Please do post this in /r/firefox 




 can confirm on Fedora 21 on some sites even after having freetype subpixel rendering and anti-aliasing enabled.  
Chrome renders extremely thin fonts, still looking for an answer.  
One solution is to use your own custom fonts by changing the browser settings. 




 ive done it all, even gstreamer(both versions) is installed, and the test case at http://www.quirksmode.org/html5/tests/video.html plays the MP4/H264 but YouTube wont show green :( 




 there is opensouce http://emojione.com/  
Its meant for the Web, but it could to be implemented in distro's with some mods  
Nobody has shown interest in color emojis on Linux so far  




 amd actually is more better with their driver support and openness, but yes a pain to find and install.  
Its similar with nvidia when u have new things like Optimus tech and all happening.  
Some looking around(RPM Fusion) should help you, orelse get the drivers from the AMD website itself. Its the best possible source. 




 its because your middle mouse click has been activated, by some key combo mostly.  
Autoscroll allows you for 4 way scrolling. 




 oh yea, ive noticed in the YouTube html5 page MSE   H264 still appears disabled :(  
wishing things work out! 




   the puzzle.
 
 Mozilla is starting with Facebook video as they're rolling out Shumway, so if Facebook suddenly eliminated their use of Flash it would be...

oh awesome! :D  
Hoping Shumway rolls out to linux soon :D   




 Try booting into safe mode!  
It disables rest of the apps, if thats causing some interference and also try wiping "cache" in recovery    




 /u/Alhaitham_I corrected me, its an instagram embed facebook. 




 ah yes true, i didnt see/might've missed the instagram overlay.  
Thanks for correcting me! :) 




 im on Nightly 38.0a1 (2015-02-22) and its so far appeared for that video in the screenshot, guess it was some kind of momentary test run 




 :) Check your omtc status in 'about: support'  




 Bad UI, pricing, minimum marketing and no guaranteed updates across the entire android range.  




 Ah I meant for Linux  
I guess in Windows it's already enabled by default, if not you just need to enable the omtc option and not the one I've mentioned here.  
I'm not sure of the technicalities of the property I mentioned to be enabled but without it omtc on Linux remains disabled.  




 also this - layers.acceleration.force-enabled 




 ah yes true that method will work.  
I was served this version without spoofing the user agent on linux. 




 On mobile yes, but not on desktop i think.  
Never saw the html player on Facebook before 




 i think it hasn't been implemented properly, i was lucky to get this in html mp4, others have been using flash X_X 









  Ah, so there's several patents covering Cleartype, I didn't know that.

yeah! its also the same case H264 and many audio/video formats 




 oh you should have mentioned Debian  
"Xft.lcdfilter: lcddefault" is what you need i feel. Check out this link for more info:  
http://www.reddit.com/r/debian/comments/1ofgl7/howto_better_looking_fonts/

EDIT - about the Liberation Sans, i think its wise to file a bug report to debian to make them aware of the issue on the choppiness of the font, so that they can rectify it! 




 Lcdfilter will enable sub-pixel rendering. Great font rendering on lcd screens.  




 From Wiki:  
"Microsoft has several patents in the United States on subpixel rendering technology for text rendering on RGB Stripe layouts. This had caused FreeType, the library used by most current software on the X Window System, to disable this functionality by default.[4]

Apple was able to use it in Mac OS X due to a patent cross-licensing agreement.[12]

The patents 6,219,025, 6,239,783, 6,307,566, 6,225,973, 6,243,070, 6,393,145, 6,421,054, 6,282,327, 6,624,828 were filed between 1998-10-07 and 1999-10-07, thus should expire in 2019-10-07" 




 http://www.reddit.com/r/Fedora/comments/12jetj/you_dont_need_infinality_for_pretty_text/  
http://www.webupd8.org/2013/06/better-font-rendering-in-linux-with.html  
Any of these 2 methods will drastically improve font rendering, Infinality will also mimic other OS's font rendering mechanism.  
And your browser is also responsible, for some unknown reason Chrome is sub-par at font rendering, do try out Firefox, its simply good these days.  
Also the Liberation Sans font is choppy(if on fedora[maybe other Linux's too] - reported bug but no action has been made yet)

EDIT - There are patents preventing these from enabled by default which is why its left to the users choice 




 Restart and power off phone would be nice  




 This does seem as the issue "Liberation Sans"  
I have it installed on my system (fedora 21) but even in LibreOffice the font is not properly anti-aliased/hinted. Something wrong i guess with the font, will try find a fix for that!  
Thank You for narrowing this problem down :) 




 I have my font rendering correctly setup on Linux,  
It's strange because every other site renders fine except this 




 I do have anti aliasing enabled to rgb, sub-pixel rendering on, and freetype installed. 

It's only this site that has messed up font rendering, everything else is amazing  









 If your graphics card is nvidia Optimus  hybrid technology, then Google for the bumblebee project and install on your os 




 Why so serious?  
   
Docking!

 ah yes that's my last resort :) 




 im thinking of fallback mode.  
EDIT - i just read on some page that pc's made withing the last 3-5 years could work fine.  
On my current machine(i3 4gb ram) - its below 120 MB 




 Thank you for the info! :D  
Just what i wanted to know :D  
Its my first time with debain and just didn't want a bad experience. Thank you Again :) :D 




 ah yes, i did try those links out before coming here, but i couldn't find what i was looking for, luckily the r/debian community has helped me out.  
Thank you for additional info too :D 




 yeah ive been thinking about it too, im just hoping gnome can be used fine with a 512mb ram environment. It used to run the old version of Fedora pretty well and its been a long time(4+ years) since i upgraded it.  
New fedora has a huge minimum req. and ive been wanting to get debian for a long while.  
just hoping it works out fine :)  




 thanks for the live image Readme - help me clear up a bit of the confusion :) 




 what bout these live cd's/usb version(1GB or so i think)?  
the thing thats confusing me is the standard edition and gnome edition. Does the standard have no Desktop Envirnoment? 




 Thank you for the link and answer, but what if I'm without internet? 




 Hello r/debian  
im almost on the verge to get debian for my old system as i found out it will run on hardware(512MB Core Duo) a few years back.  
But as i went to download the live installation media, i found out 2 version's - gnome and standard?  
Whats the difference between those two?  
I'm looking for a gnome desktop as natural because ive been used to it with Fedora a long time.   
Does the standard ship with the gnome desktop or do i have to get the gnome iso as such.   
Also is the installation text based or GUI?   

EDIT - SOLVED - i got the info i wanted to know! Thank you kind people of /r/debian ! :D  
If you do have more info to share, please do! :)

 I feel so sad for him. 
Stay strong. 
May your dog Rest In Peace  




 glad it helped, its hard to live without the app though, i just wish they made it better to use the RAM efficiently  




 Google has made an amazing blunder of the update mechanism. 
Why don't they approach the update system just like other Linux systems  
























 * Chrome and Firefox security i feel is almost at par with each other.  They both get owned at Pwn2Own and every other contest, so its just evolution. Multiprocess(Electrolysis) is coming to Firefox soon.    
* Chrome is quite ahead on HTML5 support true, but Google has a lot of "only works on chrome" going that will hurt the open web for the future. Google being in a more dominant position also tries to make switch which is in their favor at times (eg. recent HTML5 switch on YouTube - Media Source Extensions )  
* UI customization. Hands down. Nobody comes close to Firefox.
* I think Firefox also wins here with the support of Firefox Sync, and it is cross-platform(iOS version coming soon). But each to his own.  
* Privacy - Cant stress this enough to matter because people just DON'T want to value it; Went you get Chrome from Google, there is and always will be some form of Privacy trade off.   
Firefox is for pro-privacy and supports DO NOT TRACK tech. Chrome is just a blind NO to this question. 
Mozilla doesn't want your data but Google will surely want it some how.    
* READER MODE! :D (i love this on android now, will come soon to Desktop)  
* Extension support - I personally feel Firefox rules this (maybe the fanboy in me)  
* Firefox on Top of the [Browser GrandPrix](http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/chrome-27-firefox-21-opera-next,3534-12.html).  2013 yes - didn't find a new one :( .  
Also beat chrome out on [benchmarks](http://arewefastyet.com/) - Lower is better.  
* Personally hate the new "Works on Chrome" or "works on webkit" views. If you're a dev YOU SHOULD ensure your site works everywhere. Another reason i stick to Non-Webkit browsers.  

EDIT - Chrome is Tetsuo aka RAM hog :(  
As for "apps" on Firefox - https://marketplace.firefox.com/ 




 Button's a clean driver. Alonso gets real aggressive once he finds a sweet spot. 




 after staying in the 11th floor of a building in Pune with little-no coverage; i had enough with airtel! 




 BSNL 3g speed is good! I was kinda surprised when it touched 1000kbs while i was in Andhra. Went to a forest reserve recently and only BSNL had coverage there too. 
I like Docomo too; they have better 2g speed that the rest 




 Nope, it's a separate company, they only use the search part and ands protection layers over it so that everything is encrypted and not tracked.  




 "toll-free"*  
*-Introductory offer. Subject to market conditions 




 you dont have to go directly to google - look into https://startpage.com/ ;) 




 look into https://startpage.com/ ;) 




 Alonso should never be blamed for switching teams; its his life and he had to turn it around; being second best is nothing in this sport where winner takes it all.  
It was Frustrating as a Ferrari fan to see ferrari not deliver for many years in a row. Im now happy that Ferrari is doing something and i wish Alonso's future also brightens up 




 apple's apps and the apps using internet is a very different thing. Surprised he cant see that stark difference. 




 Flipkart maybe be run by Indians in India, but works out of Singapore  









 pipelight or the original crap flash from Adouche 




 i do understand that part; everybody is competing, i just hope some miracle happens to McLaren 




 im hoping for a reverse BrawnGP :'(
 




  I just can't see Honda get their act together. 

They've been catching up seconds; they have finally started completing a race. Its hard to play catch-up when you've been out of f1 for long. Matter of time.
 




 i think McLaren has a chance to go to the top; Ferrari was trailing far behind from the Mercs until the safety car came;  
The only champion car on the grid is the Merc and every thing else doesn't matter, Alonso saying if they(Ferrari) are not on the top, his move was fine, seems alright to me now.  

disclosure: Ferrari Fan(even though i support Alonso) 




 you need the proper Gstreamer 0.10   1.0 version codecs for h264 to work properly 




 you sir are awesome! 




 It certainly is possible, you just need the right color palette.   
Digital Painting isn't that bad with gimp. Once you get a hang of the brushes and brush settings your work flow will be smoother.   
Path tool can help you with sharp edges or strokes.  
Also use layers, definitely helps and saves time on mistakes.   

If you're trying to Make something of the face mash thing like the images you posted, know how to cut out images properly. Use layers, set warmth tones, use curves, blur and clone tool. 

Edit - combine multiple software like krita, mypaint and Gimp, you'll finish much faster  




 yup! they have to pay for this!   
Also do consider - http://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/31vvf2/fight_for_net_neutrality_the_way_forward/cq7yfta

 i did file a [bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1041968) on this, nothing has happened so far though :(  
Still happens on my Stock 5.0.2 lollipop Moto G at times, after consistently browsing for some time. Most reproducible when i repeatedly use the search fields of some sites.(more crash prone in private browsing mode)

 




 That article is shitting people with that bunch of links 




 There's an option in the setting's to get the enter key long pressed for emojis 




 lower is better for all.  
You can choose the different systems under "Machines"  
 




 ah nope not everywhere http://arewefastyet.com/ 




 Snoop Using Linux OS;  
The foot icon belongs to GNOME - an Open-source Desktop Environment - the most common/default on most Linux distros 




 You would have like it better if you had watched it in the theater though; i saw the IMAX and non-IMAX version, and i must say IMAX is truly miles ahead. Its very immersive when you get the IMAX scenes, and the sound/music shakes up everything!

 get ublock. its highly efficient, OSS, and light on memory compared to others 




 scrolls pretty well for me

 i like it a lot, personally.  
Its improved a *hell lot* from where it started.  
Yeah there maybe a couple of bugs here and there, but its been a good experience overall :)  
For me - uBlock, themes, Firefox Sync, privacy and a neat UI - cant ask for anything more. 









 i guess you could use "ifup"/"ifdown" 




 I feel bad for both kimi and alonso. Both of them have hard quite a rough time for a long time now.

  My BP is rising after reading each question.  

So per minute call charges; Customer Care charges(treat you like shit too); Monthly Data Packs charges(when internet is actually cheaper tech); No HD voice calls(except DoCoMo); Poor connectivity, Roaming charges etc.

 Fernando Alonso resembles Che Guvera :D 




 Why don't you try some other project like pipelight or so. They run on the latest flash version. See if that helps  














 IIRC it refers to the situation in the Tie Fighter game  




 Why is this not on the Front PAGE? :O   
ITS AWESOME! 









 Ah I'm on nightly 

What im saying is without MSE, the playback with HTML5 video playback on Linux is bad, stuttering. With MSE it is better(but yeah bugs are present).

 Does look like emoji, you'll need to get the right fonts for your particular OS. 




 i was on Infinality for a while, Switched to Freetype later.  
I wasn't able to stick to a specific rendering style for long xD 




 Still no luck:  
MIME Type: video/mp4; codecs="avc 1.42001e mp4a.40.2"  
DASH: no(18)  

Just to clarify, tried this out on a fresh profile.  
I only have the top 3 box's (HTMLVideoElement, H.264, WebM VP8) enabled on the YouTube HTML5 page and the rest disabled. MSE disabled by default.  
If i do enable MSE then vp9 kick's in most of the time, but it currently has A/V sync issue's among others which let the devs to disable MSE on Linux. 




  onts still seemed somewhat blurry). I didn't know about Infinality, I'll have to try it one of these days. The fact that it includes "Windows" presets seems to be promising.

yeah i think Infinality is better for your use(has Mac styles too).  
Im on Freetype though, serves me the best :) 




 chrome used a technique called *Head fake* to give you an illusion of speed.   
Undoubtedly, this has been adopted by others too.  
http://www.computerworld.com/article/2519182/desktop-apps/mozilla-designer-touts-tricks-to-give-firefox-the-illusion-of-speed.html

Edit - word 




  I can put Firefox on Linux and Windows side-by-side, and the one that hurts my eyes is not on Windows.  

Please do try out freetype-freeworld or Infinality(there's nothing better than this in the world)

  ou should confirm what codec YouTube is using for the video you watch.

For me its always - avc 1.42001e mp4a.40.2 and it feels horrible :'( 




 He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out 




 ah yes, saw this, i just wish basic support is added to gnome-release for now.
Edit - looks like very little activity there 




 sorry for your time! didnt understand properly first time. 




 oh okay, understood it wrong.
Thanks for correcting me 




 ah! dont know bout that, you'll have to stick to one 




 yup it does! :)

Edit - watch comment below 




 export chrome desktop data - Firefox  
Use Firefox sync for cross platform sync. 




 Also long press a video and 'Open with App'  and choose vlc - perfection  




 I'm not sure. I haven't reported one.  
Hoping this issue on the radar.  




 I've got gstreamer 0.1 and v1 both installed.(hopefully believe I have the right packages)  
Firefox should mention somewhere on the help what all packages are needed for a user.  

And everything is at default, YouTube html5 shows a tick mark on h264. Mse disabled.  




 h.264 is bad on Linux :(
No Smooth buffering, and playback stops at times. 




 I had something similar while closing tabs, but I had filed a bug report and it was resolved.  
Are you on the latest version of Firefox? If yes and this continues to persist better file a bug report.  




 Yup it is.  




 They have to use what apple provides, nothing much from the outside 




 Felt the same. I think because few people use Yahoo, their page-ranking system is bonkers. But its quite decent for day to day use :) 




 Second this. Should be mentioned on the Play Store itself. 




 People do use it, emoji became an article on [OMGUbuntu](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2014/11/see-install-use-emoji-symbols-ubuntu-linux)  
hmm...wish i knew how its done and understand other peoples code 




 Ah im not sure if this is gonna help you, but with bumblebee installed and running, you could use "optirun -b auto nvidia-settings -c :8" to activate nvidia-settings and create specific Application Profiles.  

Other option could be to use the Nvidia proprietary drivers(incase you're still on nouveau).  
In PowerMizer set to Max Performance.  

Also check out these guides, might help you:
http://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/6_5/rel/docs/CUDA_Getting_Started_Linux.pdf  
http://www.quantstart.com/articles/Installing-Nvidia-CUDA-on-Ubuntu-14-04-for-Linux-GPU-Computing  

Hope you find a solution! 




 i think your app should be able to use GPU when needed automatically.  
Maybe if your look around you could set some parameter/command to permanently run the app with a GPU. Or the Nvidia Settings Manager could be of help.  
As far as i know the battery drains as fast as the usage. When your hooked to the power port, it just lets current pass through, nothing more i feel.   




 well since you've turned off optimus, your power consumption has shot up. Your only other way around is to disable the GPU In BIOS if it does support such a feature.  
Me currently using bumblebee and its your best shot for proper power management. I think its better than the nvidia-prime thing.  
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee
 




 okay, i dont understand a thing on that page. :/  
Im gonna quietly wait for this. :'( 




 There's lots open source emoji projects like [EmojiOne](http://emojione.com/) but none have made into the Linux Desktop.    
Every other OS now has support for color emoji's and emoji input as well.  
Why's it taking so long? Emoji has gone mainstream and is used a lot these days.

 if you card is Optimus based, i think you should definitely use [Bumblebee](http://bumblebee-project.org/); it takes care of power management very well. 




 Yes! Create a separate profile - https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-firefox-profiles  
Now. Enjoy. 




 awesome :D 




 It is!
Maybe just check the menu and see the  settings of your addons if it's enabled  




 Synfig  




 Firefox + ublock addon will help you!  




 Firefox sync provides sync capabilities  across platforms.   
Install the hangouts plug-in. I use it, works pretty good  









 time based sort should be extended individual albums 









 Since MSE is disabled on the Linux Nightlies, i've been served video's on YouTube with the codec "avc 1.42001e mp4a.40.2" but the playback is extremely choppy and stalls every now and then.  
Other than enabling MSE(which i currently avoid due to A/V sync issue); anyone know what could be the trouble or a fix for it?

EDIT - also no DASH support 




 Check these tools - http://www.nirsoft.net/password_recovery_tools.html 




 Maybe F3 is the alternative key for you. Im not sure why Ctrl+F isnt working out, but its fine for me on my Fedora. Try checking out in Gnome Setting - Keyboard - Shortcuts 




 Giant title bar - get HTitle addon  




 Triangle - Very Unique 




 recommend you to create a fresh separate profile for nightly 




 ah well depends, sometimes the updates in Nightly are small 3-4MB or 7-10MB.  
You get the 45MB+ updates when you haven't updated for a few days time.

EDIT - yes mostly once a day, unless something of critical importance breaks(quite rare) 




 Is your system a Dell/Asus? They use something similar to that name for updates or something(if im not wrong) 




 i think you need to reset your browser:  
https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/refresh-firefox-reset-add-ons-and-settings  

Or create a new profile(Backup - data first!):  
https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-firefox-profiles   




 i use beta, wasn't working on beta. Thank You for the info :) 




 I remember trying out Chrome when it launched, its was good then, but i continued using FF.  
After a while i started reading about all the amazing headfake techniques chrome uses(like faster animations) to make people believe its faster. Once android came, i knew Chrome would rise to a peak and so much control to a corporate wasn't good i felt.  
And NSA happened too.  

Stuck with Firefox all these years(From version 1.3 or 1.5) and i still love this browser! I hope once they launch the iOS version soon, Mozilla will get a better hold of the mobile market, and also if they launch on Windows Phone it will be a win too. 




 Had a canvas 2, i used it for 2 years, pretty good phone, even though it was big.  Somehow adjusted and got used to the size. I gave up on them when no sources were released and no further OS updates by Micromax. Also a horrible Service center experience.  

Switched to the Moto G 2ng Gen. (2014).  
Its well designed, has the same screen size of 5 inches like the Canvas 2 but the curved back, the thinner screen edge bezels, super comfortable to hold and with a feel-good material Motorola has won me over completely.  
Also Brilliant Hardware performace and Awesome reliability on Software Update and love for almost-Stock Android experience.   




 Thank God this is being addressed(Voted!), browsing unknown sites on mobile is a pain with all the ads auto opening in new tabs and random downloads. 
























 Thank you for this :D 




 ah yea, but manageable  




 It's got the curves and it looks so good  




 i hope my aero knowledge helps me here...  
That paint will give give a better picture of real world conditions.  
Wind tunnels have streamlined flows and is limited by the model size and wind-speed generation.  
when you have a car testing out on a track you'll get more accurate flow patterns(especially turbulent nature), i hope they record the footage because that's the way you can infer the data you gain.  

For eg. on the front winglet side below CNN [3rd pic](http://imgur.com/a/CwxBt) you can clearly see the 3 vortex shapes  
2nd pic - a good part of airflow is going into the side vents

 i personally don't have a MacBook, friends do and they swear by Safari's being the kindest on the battery. Chrome does reduce it by hours.  
I've been avoiding Flash on Linux for a long-time now, don't remember it being a severe drain for me...probably coz i stay off video sites 




 Chrome is massive battery drain http://www.theverge.com/2015/4/10/8381447/chrome-macbook-battery-life 




 :D good! 




  latex

not sure, Give it another try ;) 




 i get constant broken playback with the spinner on 0:00 - 0:25 seconds. After that somehow it mans up and plays :| 




 Brilliant :D 




 same reason :D 




 i agree with this, playback is way smoother on chrome than Firefox by a good margin on Linux and considerably closer with Windows 7 




 yeah a wait till 2019 




 do check out Infinality and freetype-freeworld ;) 




 you should definitely check out Infinality and freetype-freeworld then ;) 




 Dont know if this will help you, but try switching to OpenDNS or Google DNS.  
Also noticed WiFi performance drops when an external Hard Drive is connected due to interference.   
Try [Reset Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/refresh-firefox-reset-add-ons-and-settings) or [Create a New Profile](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-firefox-profiles)(Data Loss if not backed up) 




 i think MS is quite happy with its ClearType Tech. Its sucks on the desktop for me but i do like it on WP. Very Crisp and sharp.  

The Font scene is patent ridden. We would have had better than Apple level font rendering on Linux and elsewhere but sadly some patents still [remain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpixel_rendering) and hinder progress.  

But as always workarounds are possible on Linux with:  
[Infinality](http://www.webupd8.org/2013/06/better-font-rendering-in-linux-with.html) and [Freetype-freeworld](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fedora/comments/12jetj/you_dont_need_infinality_for_pretty_text/)

EDIT - ClearType + DirectWrite from Win 7 onwards 




 All of us love good fonts and the way its rendered on our Android devices, but I think its more important to be thankful to the project and its creators/contributors who work behind the scenes.  
Meet Freetype - http://www.freetype.org/  :D

Ps.   
If you'd like to contribute to their funding campaign - https://pledgie.com/campaigns/24434 




 i hope this helps, and gimp gets its charm back!  
More importantly if some team solely works on GIMP it'll be a big win :D   




 the team that takes it up has to deliver, or the trust is lost 




 Thanks a lot for the info :D  
i was surprised when the i noticed the difference between Beta   Nightly.(Logged into Windows 7 after several months).

My laptop's graphics drivers are updated as per Dell's site.  
The Intel website asks me to use the manufacturers driver(older compared to Intel) when i went there looking for updated version, saying that some drivers maybe custom built for specific hardware. I didn't mess around with the drivers after reading that :|

EDIT - yes turning off HWA fixed the issue for me in nightly   




 Why do i get a black audio-only YouTube video on Nightly vs normal playback on Firefox Beta?   
Windows 7 64bit (including Browsers)  
I've tried out turning off Hardware Acceleration as the current work around for the issue on Nightly. Any Idea why this happens? 




 i wish somebody does this for GIMP. It could use some love! 




 Darth Vader's ride 




  Is there no other environmental agency other than greenpeace?

Yes there are! And it would be better if we have them than not.  
Personally haven't seen anyone else take the fight ,on different issues, to the corporate giants and the Govt itself.  

 The only deep pockets I saw were of greenpeace. Chipko andolan worked without foreign support. Dont try to show greenpeace as warriors.

Yes i agree, income should be audited and things like this should be transparent; but same should be made mandatory for Political parties, Govt. Income   Expenditure along with finance listing for top organizations in the country.   
This is where its one-sided.   

 They are just a front for vested interest

Legally(Court) they haven't been accused for any mistake so far.  

 The ones which would like to keep any country energy dependent. If even govt promotes solar, they will start opposing production of solar panels.

I disagree. Every country is energy dependent be it US, Japan etc. They import resources to make Energy(Oil, Uranium, Coal).   

Yes i do agree to the fact that protest against the Nuclear Plant in the south was harsh, i personally support nuclear power, but you can't avoid a Disaster like Fukushima can You?   
Radioactive contamination has reached the shores of Canada today.  
Chernobyll is still a ghost town, the negative of Nuclear Power is still very dangerous.  
The Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant is in a region of Seismic activity, and i hope it works in perfect condition to benefit us all.  

If even govt promotes solar, they will start opposing production of solar panels.

LOL. Solar power is greener and I don't think anyone will oppose it. But yes it has negative effects too  
solar heats the region in which the plant is situated to extremely hot temperatures. Its [frying birds](http://news.discovery.com/tech/alternative-power-sources/worlds-largest-solar-power-plant-scorching-birds-140219.htm) these days. Best way is to locate it in non migratory paths of flying creatures.  









 Exactly, i can see why you got the down-votes.  
Transparency should be at every level from party incomes to MNC giants as well.  
I agree Greenpeace has sometimes been aggressive with Environmental Issues, but its not like they killed some big project for the worse.   
This seems a one-sided battle to crush your opposition because you can't be better.  
Deep pockets try an score a win every where.  
And honestly we need a Greenpeace or something of its kind. None of us citizens are so morally bothered to protect our environment or the way its misused by corporate giants in the name of "development"   









 why dont you save the VM after doing the initial setup? 




 you'll need this https://www.google.com/tools/dlpage/hangoutplugin 




  Donations should always come from people who can afford the one dollar and that dollar won't impact their lives in any way.

Yes! I do wish people who could afford pay for it though.  
  
Also i believe if a game is launched and it has great reviews, people wont be put-off for doing a one-time payment/donation.  
I recently bought Limbo because they slashed prices.  
What becomes irritating is in-app purchases to unlock some special feature, it does help you but it has a bad impact on the mindset of a user and keeps them from coming back.
 




 The problem with donation is the currency conversion.  
Dollars might be good for the west and the people living there, but for us on the East say,   
India  1$=63.58 Rs  
Japan 1$=119.78 yen  
Philippines 1$=44.58 peso  

It is quite a considerable amount. In india you'd get 12-13 packs of 5Rs biscuits or 4 Packets of bread(15 Rs.)   
Most of the people here in possession of a smart phone are teens and early adults who depend on their parents to provide them with funds, so they tend to avoid buy/donating apps which cost.   
Probably once they start earning this trend could change  

I do buy games and donate if im in financial capacity though :)   




 check your add-ons. Follow the trouble shooting instruction on the right side of this page.  

If nothing fixes its probably because of low RAM. Yes throwing away the external antivirus/firewall softwares could help in getting more free ram for the browser.  
Another thing you could do it browse with some tab limit - like 4-6 tabs   









 This post Represent! 
Thank You _/\_ for working on this 




 it look STUNNING O_O :D
I wish every TV gets this or a way to load this OS  




 loading fine for me  




 Please do try using safe mode and browsing for a while and see if that makes a difference.  If its fine then one of your add-ons is the likely problem source.  

You could [Refresh](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/refresh-firefox-reset-add-ons-and-settings) your browser. Warning you'll have to reinstall your add-ons.  

Create a SEPARATE new profile and see if that works out for you OR back up data and move it to a new profile.  
https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-firefox-profiles   




 Technology wise - yes, i believe it will atleast by the next few version Firefox will come on par with things already implemented by chrome and go beyond as well.   

We need Mozilla and Firefox to exist for an open web, even if Usage etc. go down, because i don't think anybody preaches/pushes forward an Open Web like Mozilla. We had 'works on IE' before, that got addressed well and now we could see that situation rise again.  

Only when people/users make switches can the trend change for the better.  

Usage   Adoption - this depends entirely on a persons perspective. If a person feels chrome is the best thing on the planet, then you cant change him/her. Other who have a different ideology, say they value privacy or OpenSource/Standards developed software a lot, then Firefox becomes the best choice for that person.  
It really comes to a personal choice and if you're willing to make a change.  

EDIT  
Non-tech savvy people - they would be least bothered. They just want something that works.  
Only way to change them is to educate them or market better(which Chrome is all about).  
This is one crowd that has to be considered because for them defaults/ad's and marketing make it the best product.   




 VP9 is still being worked on, so once that comes playback will be super good 




 i think bugs are being filed for this, do have a look at bugzilla. 




 On android they are splitting up Facebook and the messages app as Messenger. Users are required to download both if they want access to Facebook and if they want to message their friends. 


Browser side I don't think we'll see a difference whether you use Firefox on android or desktop to browse facebook.com  




 O_O probably clear cache from Recovery.  
Runs smooth on my phone. Use it everyday 




 it runs fine on my moto g 1 Gig.  
It was a different story on my 512MB Ram Mediatek Micromax Canvas. Horrible.  
But yeah i do agree on the hog part  




 Mediatek ones, snapdragon processors run fine. 




 Also - Please spread Web Literacy. It is crucial for the future. Take part in event that promote Web Literacy.  
Being misinformed is as dangerous as being unaware or ignorant.   









 i think i have taken it for granted for a long time now  









 Enable webM in about config, in case it hasn't been enabled. I think it's still a WIP - vp9 support  




 I hope you are talking about desktop Firefox.  
visit www.youtube.com/html5 check that every box is enabled and html5 player is active.  
Change quality by clicking the gear icon on the player.  
Right click video - stats for nerds to see if its mp4/vp9   




 flair it solved
 




 go to your firefox folder in terminal and execute the firefox file located there "./filename"  
If there's any error you should see there.  
Im on Fedora/ubuntu and using Firefox so not a linux or firefox problem. Something related to your set-up.  
Also ensure you're not behind any proxy or check the proxy settings in the browser/system  
For Firefox - PreferencesAdvancedNetworkConnection Settings 




 Also additional info - vp9 kinda works fine on chrome and firefox. Its just without MSE its kinda horrible  




 oh thanks a lot! :) hope it gets resolved soon! 




 H264 - Buffering is not smooth and choppy, so playback stops until video is loaded further

 Dont want to switch it off, i hope it helps in telemetry.  
I believe it might be reported since its be ongoing for sometime, trying to bug hunt it down. 




 Flair it 'Solved'! :) 




 Im getting this quite a lot on Nightly version 40.0a1 (2015-04-29) on Fedora Linux 20 with e10s enabled  
"a web page is causing Nightly to run slowly. What would you like to do"  
This happens randomly after some continous time of browsing, and every tab I have opened goes white with that spinner loading icon - spinning.  
Clicking the 'x' stop button on awesome/address bar does not stop the page loading.  
Refreshing other tabs also has no effect.  
Firefox keeps showing the loading spinner in content display area.  
Killing the Web process, works but this problem comes back rather quickly  
Any solution? I've only been using facebook, reddit, bugzilla, Imgur, whatsapp web.  
Also many a time, switching inbetween tabs causes the white page and loading spinner to re-appear(This happens often).  
Tried the normal trouble-shoots i.e. new profile, refresh browser etc.   




 awesome :) 




 check what boxes are checked on youtube.com/html5. 
if everything is checked you should get it without troubles.  

Also it came first to chrome because it is a Google product, just like YouTube. They went in with full preparation to implement and launch before others hoped onto the train. 




 yeah thats there, i survive on a 1k unliimited plan 




 That is expensive! 3k of your salary on internet connectivity is horrendous 




 Yes it becomes more lossy. They compress it to save on size. Happens on Facebook all the time for any pic above a 100kb 




 Bsnl had given me the best speed on 3g. It surprised me. Docomo was great for 2g  




 i finally got it! :D

 You need to install a codec pack.    
You'll probably have to download Windows Media Player if its not already installed.

 aw thats bad :/  
Ps. - Join the LinuxMasterRace! ;) 




 https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/984694 




 why don't you try creating a separate new profile and see if the issue persists, without installing any additonal add-ons etc, and browsing as you do.  

If things are fine now, the mostly some add-on you have is to blame or you could backup your Firefox data, create a new profile and restore the data  




 shumway is flash for firefox. Im not sure if its going to help your YouTube viewing.   
what you should be doing is possibly get a codec pack installed on your system for "h.264".  
The options to enable MSE on the second line lies in about:config. under "mediasource" 




 It's the sound of hope!  




 Do u have an external hard drive connected when this happens?

 Im not familiar with AMD hybrids, but on Bumblebee(Nvidia) you get to use the GPU with and "optirun" command to force such an action. There could be something like that for AMD.

 http://wp.me/p1eITv-20 made this a while back, has all the usage basics to give a head start right away  




 what all enabled for you on youtube.com/html5 ? 




 I think it's because of adaptive streaming rates, you can go low as 144p. Trying setting YouTube player to 360p for some decent quality  




 oh, thanks for pointing that out! 




  Don't Track Me Google, ah just enable it in the settiings/Preferences - Privacy (Do Not Track) - no need for extensions.

 you're welcome :) 




 there could be a solution, im just not aware of it 




 Snippet - http://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/39yf9n/how_do_i_restore_my_firefox_page_to_the_original/  


i use ctrl+T and start typing away.  
My New tab opens my about:newtab page. So i stay in the URL bar and can type away.  

And yes you can type keywords in URL Bar and it will search for what you entered with a search engine or previously accessed URL's 




 i think its a WIP:  
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=820679  
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=878288  

Hope someone knows a temp solution.

 it'll go away soon, new announcements happen there from mozilla's side to create awareness.   
in about:config "browser.aboutHomeSnippets.updateUrl" to empty value should do it(DISCLAIMER - ive not tested this personally so not sure of the consequences and dont blame me :) ) 




 i meant the OS theme, Windows Classic possibly, but anyway small thing 




 ah im really not sure on this, maybe you've switched system themes or so?   
If im not wrong, its implemented by the OS so probably some theme is causing the trouble; orelse the only other possibility is that the CSS rendering is different for different browsers.  
http://www.marioaraque.com/html-css-checkbox
  
Im on Linux currently, and im subject to the OS styling.  

Bug related - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=605985 




 the '!' mark shows thats its not enabled, and thats the way it should be as default for now.   
When webM gets properly implemented you'll have an awesome video experience on YouTube.   

I don't really understand the tick boxes situation, could you please post a image/screenshot somewhere? 




 in case your youtube is working fine then, i guess its okay.  

If you're still having problems its better to start off with a fresh new profile.  

Since you said webM is enabled on the youtube.com/html5 page, i thought it would be better to have a refresh/new profile created.  
WebM is still under development and as such you'll run into issues with video playback.  
You can disable it in about:config "media.mediasource.webm.enabled"  in case its still enabled.  
 




 I'd recommend you to still refresh the browser and if that doesn't work out then create an a new profile and use Firefox.   

https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-firefox-profiles

Mostly likely the old browser which is based on firefox has left some settings enabled and that's causing all your troubles.  
Your YouTube video problems are most likely happening because you have webM support enabled   




 visit youtube.com/html5 and report here how many boxes are ticked and unticked.  

If you've used FF before and then stopped using it, i'd recommend you start off with a fresh profile. If you don't want to do that then you can reset Firefox in Menu-Help-Troubleshoot Information  




 This needs to be stickied!  
Also info on HTML5 playback that webM is still under going development and its better not to turn it manually for normal usage.   




  The State Bank of India tells me I need an international card since purchases made in the Play Store count as International purchases. Whatever that means.

You'll need to activate your card for international purchases. IIRC Cards before 2013 Dec have this On as default, new cards need to be activated for international purchasing.   
Contact the cards dept of your bank and they'll walk you through the process.   




 Boooooob the builder! Can you build it?  




 and better not to, its still under development - webM that is 




 you were talking of targeted advertising all the way down along with the data collection/usage etc.  

Marketing by advertisement will require some form of data without which no marketing will work.  
As long as Personal identity is not revealed or stolen, im fine with with being show products etc on my way based on things i find interesting.  
If i like something ill buy or else chuck it off.  
Humans aren't dumb to go on a purchasing spree because they see ads.  

And atleast these are not some click-bait ads that lead you to some data theft/survey/questionable site.   




 Ah not really, you can buy don't know how far you'll go to achieve your results.   
It's better to stick to gimp for that purpose  




 Hehe you're paranoid.  

 good ads  

Oh look the TV has ads! They are tracking you as well. Oh look at that street, it's filled with posters and ads. There are ad spies tracking what you look at O_O  
/s 




 And the Web is always expanding and it's future not limited.  
Being prepared is the best option.   

People can keep complaining and criticizing.  
Unless it's constructive, or contributes to a better future/implementation, there's no use for one.   

Even in case of ads Mozilla, could and possibly I hope, will make ads less intrusive.  
There are good ads and bad ads.  
Good ones are far better than the bad. 
There's absolutely nothing wrong in advertising unless you profit from unethical/unlawful use of user data.  

To be a leader you have to start preparing now or else you play catch up till the end.   




 Here are a few things you could try:  
Go into safe mode in Firefox and see if it's fine. If it's fine then Check troublesome addons.  

Create a new profile. Remember to back up old Firefox data if you need them. 

Use pipelight for flash on Linux. Yes this causes the browser to get stuck for a second or two as it loads pipelight but you'll have a much better flash experience.   
It uses the latest flash version available on windows instead of the outdated Linux version of flash  




 I suspect VR will definitely come to the Web in the future.  
Everyone is investing on the tech right now.  
Google showcasing the ability of cardboard on android could also mean that one day in the future we would have streamable VR content for maps, street view, movies, YouTube etc.   

It's better they do put in resources now, than suffer a similar backlash that's happening with Electrolysis, MSE in the future.  




 Fire marketing completely.   

Cut down on product portfolio.   Maintain 3-4 global devices.   
Get the specs, camera and design right for the flagship.  
The rest should be priced lower in the mid and low range will the best specs possible at those price range. 
Let blogs/social media do the marketing job for you.    




  I'm afraid, I disliked Australis.. and immediately installed the Classic Theme Restorer addon.

Its looks more like AutoCAD tabs than chrome/chromium tabs
 




 works pretty good.  
Shipped with Fedora 22 , gtk3 as default.  
Issue's with readability on dark themes. Light themes works as good as the gtk2 port.  
Not sure of the underlying tech but visually things are improving! :)   




 Since you're on Linux, I'd recommend you to get pipelight.  
It uses the latest version of flash available instead of the old Linux version.  
And yes when you load a page, it'll feel it's stuck for a second or 2 but it's pipelight loading flash in the background.   

For html5 videos, you can enable MSE in about:config.   
Enable everything except webM support.   
Check the status of html5 on YouTube.com/html5 




 Thats strange O_O  
For me:
"The HTML5 player is currently used when possible."  
There should be an option to switch on that page itself.  

Also you could resort to some add-ons to force enable it incase things don't work 




 Also this to true:
media.fragmented-mp4.gmp.enabled 

the youtube.com/html5 should use html5 as default player by now hopefully. You can right click and check stats on video's 




 webM is still under-development.  
Try keeping everything except webM enabled 




 Strange that  




 Set these to true

media.mediasource.enabled  
media.mediasource.format-reader.mp4  
media.mediasource.mp4.enabled  
media.fragmented-mp4.exposed  
media.fragmented-mp4.ffmpeg.enabled 




 I have everything except webM enabled on YouTube.com/html5  

I'm happy with the adaptive streaming. 

If you need some more control I think some add one works perfect, it's mentioned quite a lot here. You could search the previous posts. YouTube control center or something (development version).    




 webM still under development, so you'll encounter into issue.  
Best option is to leave webm false untile later. 




 Ah thanks for that info, updated the bug to gtk3 since this affects wine and others too.

 for me using a sennheiser HD202 on my laptop i was able to uncover the 320/Uncompressed from the 128 quite easily.  
Differentiating between the 320 and uncompressed was a little more difficult since the instruments play in the background.   
Tom's Diner was quite easy to pick out, there was an airiness and depth to the voice on the uncompressed version. 




 yeah thats possible, a trail before a complete launch. 




 Witness Me!   




 Battery life is best addressed by installing the correct Graphic drivers of your Mac. Don't really know how it works. Google will definitely help.  

In-case they have the hybrid tech like Optimus(Intel+Nvidia) i think you'll need to go for bumblebee. Be sure to read more on the internet!   




 Get gnome-tweak-tools.  


Don't forget the HTitle extension for Firefox if that's your browser choice.  
Avoid the dark-theme mode in Fedora for some time.  Firefox is still improving on the gtk3 support. The light themes work fine! :)  

Free advice- try getting used to gnome without changing it at first. You'll love it. Incase you don't go for the Gnome extensions to suit your needs.  

And remember to improve the fonts with Freetype-freeworld package or Infinality.(Check prev. post's on /r/Fedora for more info)   




 you've enabled Testtube feature https://www.youtube.com/testtube 




 the end of Candy.  
Other ones that hit me are The Great Gatsby and Seven Pounds endings 




 on linux gtk3-dark is pretty nice. Could definitely use improvements though.  
I wish i knew a way to put australis tabs on the dark dev theme. love the dark look it has. 




 Happens to me on Linux if pipelight flash is enabled. Try disabling flash and loading the page.  
On windows it mostly loads smooth for me.  




 "lspci |grep -i VGA" single line output with only intel no worries.  
Double-line output then bumblebee(if nvidia)   




 Install the graphic driver if you have an nvidia or ati.  
if you've got an intel+nvidia combo (optimus) install bumblebee.   
 




 Where did you find this?   
It seems more of a bug to me.  




 kinda yes, mostly wine, but my "open with" list is flooded with krita :(  




 voted on some of them :) 




 Done it :) 




 I tried to open a file with another app and noticed the same app repeating over and over again in the "Open With" Section.  
Can be accessed by FilePropertiesOpen With 

Edit: Filed a bug - https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1227826 




 Tabs that are selected have this white light gradient that is highly contrasting with the entire black/dark look.  
Something in this shade would be much better for selected tabs - http://people.mozilla.org/~shorlander/private-browsing-mode/mockups/australis-pbm.png  




 YAAAY! 




  The obvious interpretation of 'Kids today' is usually a comparison to 'Kids of some other time'. 

Hence the difference

 I assumed it to mean a couple of things 

"then things become unfair."
 




  But you original line seemed to indicate that you think awareness has decreased.  

Your interpretation. I never mentioned it decreased, just info not being spread as it should, so largely unchanged. 

 You didn't answer my question at all.   

O_O No thank you means - No.  
So no to paying for a software just to type an essay in a paid software when i have a Free(in all its sense) software available that does exactly the same job.   




  Orders of magnitude difference actually.

There is a difference since curious people are on the internet researching/doing stuff. As a nationwide initiative, i feel it still needs more work.  

 How much would you pay to type an essay in a word processor? 

3000+ bucks for MS Office(1Year validity) and 10000+ for the OS? No thank you.   
I can LibreOffice that export it to PDF/docx on Fedora for free.   
 




  You seem to be more worried about price than freedom.

I'm worried on both instance.  

Kids today are hardly aware/taught that there are alternatives to proprietary software.  
A notion that choice exists isn't being propagated.  
Many are falling for marketing schemes. Its not just Microsoft.  
eg. Look at Chrome and the way the marketed themselves on the road towards domination.  
More people using an Android tied to Google than an untied version like CyanogenMod.  
Win-Intel systems in schools when kids should also be exposed to Linux, Mac's, Raspberry Pi's and Aurdino's.   

The illusion that it works makes it the best. Back in the old days you had to do some work to get things to work. Today not a bit. And its quite a knowledge black-hole when you don't know how things work in the background or the steps involved in making them work.   

Also the beauty of free software, that you can view code, contribute to the project(Artwork/code etc.) and use it as well, makes it a much better source of practical programming and a robust source to gain knowledge.  

On note of price - yes worried there too.  

* A RaspPi's is much more affordable and does pretty well for general computing purpose.   
* Open Hardware is the future as well.   
* Free(cost) software means people can use apps/software without being hindered by money. Not all of us can afford the license cost to install a legal Windows copy, a cost to install MS Office, a cost to install Photoshop etc. on top of the cost required to buy the hardware.   

Good things come at a good prices, some are worth the money! But if i end to empty my bank to type an essay in a word processor, then things become unfair.

 




 I do. Been a linux/FOSS user for 15+ years :)  

Got nothing against proprietary unless they sabotage standards, open formats and kill people's freedom. 




 This needs to be in /r/Fedora   
I was playing around with Nightly GTK3 and thought i completely 'TIFU' firefox gtk2 on my system XD  
Totally surprised that F22 ships with GTK3 :D 




 if you've got WebM enabled try disable that and see 




 Everyone uses a Linux device directly or indirectly :P   
Insert android/Internet xD 




 Will take the example of school:   
Being taught that Microsoft Office is the best and only tool that can do word processing etc. And that the competition is useless.   
Children go home with the same mentality and are indirectly affected in buying paid software without being aware that there are amazing free alternatives like LibreOffice that do the same function at 0 cost.   


Need to take a look at Europe who's encouraging Free Software growth and usage any where possible; especially in education and government adoption.  




 True, but things like this shouldn't go unchecked.   
Having to feed capitalism at every end of your computer needs is bad.   
Competition should be fair.  




 Not without money. No lobbying happens without money.   
This article is more awareness than lobbying though.    




 These settings are the best for me:
$ xrdb -query

Xft.dpi: 96  
Xft.hinting: 1  
Xft.hintstyle: hintslight  
Xft.lcdfilter: lcddefault  
Xft.antialias: 1  
Xft.rgba: rgb  
Xcursor.size: 24  
 




 dangerous bijness for the future.   




 it'll take time, Intel releases their version after quiet some time  









 i think the problem is that liberation sans font is coming and overtaking all the proprietary fonts in the browser. The default liberation sans font has jagged edges.  
Try changing the browser font settings instead of the system wide font settings 




 Try freetype-freeworld or infinality for improving font rendering.  

Chrome has comparatively bad font rendering for me. I use Firefox.   Perhaps you could check that out and see if it works out for you!   




 True, Microsoft have mysteriously been trying to be nice to other OpenSource projects now.  
hope it doesn't end up on the "embrace extend extinguish" plan 




 GIMP is pretty okay, Try the old versions of blender! O_O   
Love the new blender though :D 




  despite

KDE has changed the entire experience now.  
i personally love GNOME.   
Best thing ive ever used it terms of speed/productivity. Switching between widows with the mouse has never been easier. i hardly reach for Alt+tab.    
Get hang of it for a hour and your good to go! 




 yes but what if i need to work offline and not interested in making another account for online work?  
I get a full office suite with this app on desktop without much hassles/cost  
Still cant understand why MS would keep office away from Linux now, Libre is also coming out with an online version too.  
 




 Linux was also being told off with this statement; suddenly the entire world uses it, directly or indirectly ;) 




 agreed!  
Corporate mentality comes to home as well 




 you still have to pay for MS Office on desktop.   
Libre is cross-platform ( for me a Linux user this is important)  
Nothing is completely free with MS - only an illusion, strings attached somewhere or the other.  

On another note:  
It depends on a person's mentality, If he/she stands up for a brighter future then Open Source is better in the long run and more users means better development and contributors as well.   




 Export is much better now that in the past.  
At least with Writer and Word the export is pretty good!  
I mostly export to PDF from LibreOffice and it serves better.  

The problem is proprietary formats, if you don't want to be an open standard then it is time to move on. People need to realize the fact that they themselves are breeding the source of evil. 




 They will mostly improve on it with time. They've recently updated the look on the desktop. Once things get the required pace, and look 'n feel update will come.   

First priority is to get things running and a bug-free experience :) 









 Method 1 : http://www.reddit.com/r/Fedora/comments/12jetj/you_dont_need_infinality_for_pretty_text/

Method 2 : http://www.webupd8.org/2013/06/better-font-rendering-in-linux-with.html 




  had to Google around to figure out how to use GNOME Tweak Tool to make my fonts look better.

Also Infinality for fonts if you dont like freetype-freeworld 




 Use the browser in safe mode. Check if it occurs there. If it does not, an extension is your problem   

Why hang onto Flash? Chrome, Firefox everyone is trying their best to kill it off. Chrome already enforces it on YouTube.   




 Menu  options/preferences  advanced  general  uncheck use hardware acceleration  




 try the disabling HWA only if the problem doesn't go away after the update 




 try disable HWA and check.  
Do update FF, lots of improvements have come in. 




 update firefox and enable html5 at youtube.com/html5
 




 Affordability. Usability. Need.  

* I dont find the point in getting the high-end when a better high-end comes out the following year.  
* If a mid-range can work and do all that i need then why bother with a high end?  
* Plus all the high-ends have a huge price tag that makes it over-rated and inflated value.  
* Probably the only good thing on a higher end device to me would be the camera, but if you can spend so much on one why not get a DSLR?   
* Updates are still slow unless you are on a nexus.   

Doesn't justify the cost for me personally.  

Spending so much and getting outdated with a newer product in a years usage feels like a waste.   




 600MB is quite odd. i hope they check out the crash reports.  Hopefully you aren't using extensions.  
I think lollipop might be better suited.   




 Valhalla Awaits :D 

Edit: 
Tried it out and i love it! It works fine as well as the gtk2 version for me.  
Looks pretty neat on Non-Dark GTK themes.   
Few Issues:  
 
* There are few readability issues on the Dark Theme versions(Numix; Adwaita) on GNOME like the drop down boxes on booking.com and initial loading of google.com shows the search bar as black before turning white.   

* I wish we could get rid of the BIG FAT title bar, but HTitle add-on is quite the savior. 

* And in "Get Add-ons" there is a big white space at the bottom

* Amazon tab keep stopping and showing the spinner every second before it completely loads.  

* Scroll bars disappears on booking.com drop down boxes while scrolling from bottom to top - Date; Month.  

Typed the edit on gtk 3 :D  
 




 for gmail i think it auto open them in new tabs, you'll have to normal click them 




 You can right click and open in Private Window on Unity Ubuntu.  
As far as GNOME based linux distro's are concerned, it does not seem possible.   
I think it'll be addressed in the upcoming GNOME releases.  
Not sure but do try out Gnome Shell extensions, there could be one for this purpose. 




 Menu - Preferences - General - Uncheck "When I open a link in a new tab, switch to it immediately"  

Use middle mouse button to open links in new tab or Ctrl+ left click on laptop ;) 




 glad it worked out for you :)  
i hoped it would work out, because i also experienced sudden closing of the browser before but im able to browser way better with recent than before. 




 stable does support extension.  

 It can't even render pinch zooms properly after five minutes, and crashed multiple times.

Try reinstalling  
If you have time do file a bug report 




 I've been using FF beta on moto g Lollipop,  
And seems fine, I browse for 20-30mins at a stretch and it doesn't randomly crash like before  




 Use ublock, lighter extension  




 Facebook app uses the built it WebView of Chrome on Android.  
You can open links in external browser like Firefox by changing the app settings inside the facebook app :)  

I hate both of them help each other track people x_x 




 do you have WebM enabled in youtube.com/html5 ? If yes, then try disable it in about:config 




 I am so sorry for your loss    
I'm sure Kitten's blessings and love will follow you forever.    

You sir are an awesome human being!  
Thank you for sharing this story.  
I hope good things and good times come to you!   




 Yes! It should be on the affordable side though.  
Low price and good specs can be achieved these days!  
I wish Mozilla comes out with more mid-tier phones that function as good as the others if not better 

Best strategy would he like Motorola 
3 phone lines like the moto e, moto g and moto x 
Everything shall work out good afterwards  




 [new profile](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-firefox-profiles)

Edit:
id suggest you update your graphic drivers(intel/nvidia) and then turn on HWA.
HWA should speed up video performance 




 That's surprising, I felt the opengl version to be much faster and smoother. Running into stability issues though with opengl 




 i think yes, without it its Basic OMTC and with it you get OpenGL OMTC 




 for google + privacy use [startpage](https://startpage.com/)  
Its better to use different engines from time to time. On phone i avoid Chrome and use Firefox as well, unless there is a need for which i use Opera 

EDIT - Check [Tor on Android](https://www.torproject.org/docs/android.html.en) - [Orbot](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.torproject.android hl=en) - you might like it but its slow, so patience  




 Thank you so much for sharing this!   
He fixed my lenovo laptop camera  
 




 Get HTitle add-on!  
Enjoy! ;) 




 i think its an indicator of support. Actual implementation will come to linux later 




 Whats your hardware specs?  
Did you try creating a fresh profile? 




 yeah i've read that, still seems confusing. 




 That helps performance as a plus, i hope im right.  
My laptop has hybrid graphics (Intel+Nvidia GT525M).
I've gone ahead(experimenting) and installed libva-intel-driver, libva-utils, libva-vdpau-driver;  
Any idea why it isn't installed as default?
 




 Why isn't VAAPI   VDPAU packages installed by default on Intel hardware that supports it? Is it necessary to have them?   
I've searched around but i find technical stuff, can someone help me understand if this'll help in a performance boost or so? 
























 what all is enabled in www.youtube.com/html5 ? 




 Try browsing in safe-mode and see if its happening. If not you have to disable individual add-ons and check 




 you could reduce the zoom to fit all the tabs into your view though;  im not sure why it happens, for me it shows all properly even with the search bar.   
probably you could file a bug on this   




 Only Williams deserved; everybody else just got lucky :'(  
Why Williams why? :'(

I condemn you Ferrari and Merc for today :( 




 Check your zoom level on that page, maybe resetting it to 100% could help 




 nope. you need both but a higher level of R D.  
 




 yup :D 




 Saying "I know, right!"  
If you know it then shut up! 




  The lack of trained professionals is a global HR issue with a circular solution.  

True but as long as organization who just want trained talent without any training, things will not progress. 




 True we don't lack talent.  
The problem is freshers aren't being recruited or are not giving any form of training after getting out of an engineering college.   
Without that skill the talent is wasted and you have a massive unemployment.  
Big firms want people with experience and where do you get experience from the new talent pool or without any training?  
Small firms also want people with experience because they need a solid direction and skills to survive.   
Hope things get better.    




 For you probably a [new profile](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-firefox-profiles) would work out.  
Remember to back up data, create a new profile and let it run, and if things are going smoothly try replacing with the backed up files(if you really need them)  

As OP edited post - a refresh worked out for him :) 




 china got its stuff because they hacked out the pentagon http://rt.com/news/223947-snowden-pentagon-china-hack/  
On their own creative standards they are far behind.  
That being said they know how to make quality things for the cost they get paid to manufacture.  




  The helicopter lands, and it looks like a model/mini helicopter. Totally distracted me

Yes

 




 I dont think they'll give away military tech. Very few countries and companies do that.  
From what it looks like we are just going to be a manufacturing hub and they can benefit from the low cost here, and we could probably benefit from a employment perspective.  
Actual R D wise its hard to say we are heading for an improvement.  
R D is critical or else we end up like China - a manufacturing giant 




 now It would be great if people here are hired   
2012,2013,2014... 




 Moto g user, I love it.   
No one seems to have a better optimized spec that Motorola to run android smooth on 1gb 




 Ah nope XD   
Lots of pages I visit don't have the share button's, some are placed at the top and some at the bottom or sometimes under a tiny menu of different social networks.  
So this button does come in handy.  




 refresh is the better soultion for now.  
Or else your best bet will be a new profile(keep a back up of the old one also, and try replacing the required files after things work out) 




 ive edited just check it out! 




 what OS are your on?  
problem is something went off in about:config

EDIT(in-case on Windows/similar for Linux):  
Have these values set to "True":

 quite useful! Have an easy to click button instead of searching the whole webpage for a share button 




 in about:config set "media.mediasource.webm.enabled" to true.  
Warning - playback will be buggy. Its better to use the mp4 instead.  

Verify on youtube.com/html5   
and rightclick video's to know what format you are being served   




 save for webM it actually works pretty good once you enable in about:config 




 you might have a faulty OS install or a bad Network card.  
I had this driver getting uninstalled thing because the network card was busted and worked when it wanted to work :|  

Also check for antivirus or malware   




 it can mostly be attributed to graphic card. Have you installed the proper driver?  
You could use powertop to control different stuff to increase battery life as well 




 you could also look into MyPaint and Krita as well.  
Practice now and be better at it later :) 




 yeah i hangout there at times :) 




 Does it happen is safe mode as well?

  here was some project called Ironhyde to replace it IIRC but it still had issues. Decided to return the machine for

Been working great for me :)  




 another tip is to fix a particular channel on your router.   
wifi analyzer on android could help to find the best wifi channel for your router.   




  Intel - N 7260  

There seems to be a driver here - https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/en/users/Drivers/iwlwifi   
Im guessing if you're on the latest kernel things should be smooth.  

I have a rather strange issue when i got my ext. HD connected, wifi becomes choppy. Some signal interference by the HD.  

HiDPI:  
ah i can understand, hopefully a complete fix shall come in soon!   
Firefox and Chrome have been adapted for this but i guess you have to pass some parameters.   




 Ah true :) Goodluck :) 




 i'd suggest bumblebee for Optimus stuff - pretty easy to configure! 




 who makes your wifi card?

HiDPI - im pretty sure GNOME3 and KDE support it by now.  
You can use gnome-tweak-tools to adjust HiDPI scaling.

Pipelight works pretty good. havnt tried fresh Flash player though

[Elemetary OS](http://elementary.io/) has done a major major job on polishing Linux for the mainstream - they still need work on the marketing though  
KDE 5 is still with the Shiny shiny graphics(I love it) but i've moved onto GNOME3(which is more flat in look and switching between apps fast is just out-of-the-world)  
There are still polishing touches required in GNOME3 but i can live and work with it without any problems.

I still stick with [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/) because it suits be well and has everything latest.  
Ubuntu and Debain are pretty good in terms of usability and stability(Debian is KING)

 For me it all 'just works' works now.   
My initial install only involves partitioning and hitting next-next-next on the installer screen.  
Its really a breeze these days.  
Graphic card is the only addition work I do.(windows also requires nvidia drivers)   
Since nvidia is going for optimus(Hybrid cards) i use the bumblebee package; for other nvidia cards a package from RPM fusion is all it needs.  
Fedora 22 pretty much identified everything on its own wifi, camera etc. Hell even my wacom tablet works - plug and play style.  

The other fine tuning i do which isn't system level stuff is install vlc, freetype-freeworld(for MacOS like font rendering) and apps like MyPaint, Krita, GIMP and Inkscape for drawing and Blender for 3D.   
Have VirtualBox also incase i need a Win environment within Linux for testing and Wine for some stupid windows only apps(which i rarely use these days)  

Have another system with Ubuntu and it works great as well :)

  To Release Win64 in GA before the end of 2015 in order to offer our users better experience with improvements in stability, performance, and security.

it should 




 i think a possible work around would be a user-agent switcher add-on.  
Website dev's should do the hard-work to make their sites on multiple browsers well. We are going back to the IE trend with "works on Webkit/Chrome" these days. Do ping them when you come across such a situation.  

APZC development into Firefox should also help the browsing experience.  
 




 4 years yes!  




 ah true thing. i always felt a lag when pipelight runs. Mostly because wine has to load up first. Wondering how Fresh Player compares wrt that. 




 how is this in comparison to pipelight? 




 NEVER FORGET BING BONG! :') 




 Try to reset Firefox or create a new profile.(Remember to back up data).   
One of these will surely help. 




 there is a Replicant OS - android  
http://www.replicant.us/ 




 Next they need to maintain/improve that logo for the modern age  




 The TestTube feature does work on the Nightly Linux. Can personally confirm that. And it works pretty good too.   

For YouTube Center it's better to get the developer edition from github, but you may run into bugs. There's another new one called YouTube plus that works as good as it.   

And ensure you have webM disabled in www.youtube.com/html5 or else you'll be subject to choppy performance.  




 I guess it might have been a mandatory condition to be 'selected'.  
Anyway I don't think Mozilla will compromise on cross-platform support.   
They are one of the few companies that do cross-platform pretty great. Hoping it comes soon 




 Here https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2014/05/14/drm-and-the-challenge-of-serving-users/ 




 sorry but i guess all you can do is wait for it now man.  :(   
There are more high priority things that people want to see in the release version faster.  
You could always write a patch if you can though :) 




 i think its a system setting, Nautilus also uses the same for navigation.  
https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-help/stable/keyboard-shortcuts-set.html.en 




  fonts  

Consider freetype-freeworld packages or infinality for better rendering.  

 




  And if they decide "fuck it. Not worth it" then what? What can Mozilla do them?

Probably court i guess. Things like this might have a legal background.   

I understand your frustration. No one with good tech knowledge wanted DRM on the web, but there was no viable alternative at that time too, even now.   
Plus one for-good; do-good organization standing up against behemoths of the industry can't win the fight, its quite obvious.  

Problem is normal people don't care about ethics and whats good for all as long as it work. They are willing to sacrifice privacy, good-will etc. as long as "it works"  

And yea Mozilla still maintain its anti-DRM stance with a non CDM verison of firefox. So up to you as a user to suit your needs.  
They dont force you and you still have a choice.  

 




 They should, it was the basis of the agreement to implement DRM on firefox  




 Adobe has to release the CDM on Linux. Mozilla made it mandatory they do so, only a  matter of time. 




 if you do heavy streaming, games and YouTube, you can empty in no time 




 Vote for it and wait  




 Device error? That's strange. What device are you using?  

Yeah it's behind In a way compared to chrome, but everything will match up in the next few versions.  
It's a people contributed project so things like this take some time.   




 a last test could be to clear cache from recovery or rebooting into safe mode and coming back to normal mode.  
Caution - you may have to re-login into some apps   




 different problem? well good it worked out :)  
webM is still under development, so you can expect playback issues.  
itll be enabled once its finished 




 The dark knight - opening act  
The place beyond the pines - opening act  
Drive - robbery!  
Ghost in the shell - opening  
Samsara - meat industry  
Predestination - climax   




 Check if the issue occurs without the add-on.   
If it's fine, then you'll have to report the issue to the add-on developer.   
Also the translucent layout maybe because YouTube is rolling out the new layout or you have activated the TestTube feature.   
An alternative addon might be the YouTube Center addon DEV edition.  
Also ensure webM is disabled on YouTube.com/html5.  

 




 I'd suggest you try the beta incase you're on stable.  




 Glad that it helped!   
Edit - 60fps is supported by MP4 itself  

i heard the dev version of Youtube Center is a lot better.  
You might want to check into that.   
I've not used it personally, but its pretty good for YouTube. 
You might run into issue's though since its dev edition.   




 not now if you want smooth YouTube playback.  
It'll be enabled by default once its ready   




 :)   
webM is still under development, so unless you want to take it out on a test drive to find bugs etc. its better to turn it off. 




 goto about:config and set "media.mediasource.webm.enabled" to false

  but I honestly think android devs have given up on trying to be as efficient as they can.

exactly my point
 




 Yes I agree to what you've said.  
People can hopefully afford the cost bump also.   

But bumping up ram to accommodate apps is not the right approach to this problem.   
Min requirements for Android or a Linux based desktop environment is 512Mb and I think it should stay as such.   
Optimization should be carried on the apps that consume a lot of memory.   
More stringent testing and restrictions should be made to ensure apps run on the minimum requirements before being released into the public.   




 Well... Programs should be designed to run on low memory environment.   
There a heck load of junk in a browser that's absolutely unnecessary and nothing is being done to address that. 
If a browser and an additional app require the full resource of the ram, then it's not the ram availability that's to be blamed but the program itself.    




 Maybe because  chrome is the memory hog!  
I don't understand the we want more ram deal here much.   
512mb was hard on heavy android usage but 1 gig is totally fine.   
It's a phone not a desktop computer *_* 




 Easter egg, :)  




 I think i wasn't clear.  
I'll take the example of moto g here, its perfectly engineered.  
Solid build, great plastics, and amazing design. It fits in your palm without any effort and stays there perfect.   
Software and battery life is highly optimized because they choose the best components on the market and assemble them.  
No heating issue's because again great engineering.  
ROM is highly optimized. Goes on for weeks without restarting.  
Great call quality(i only find this in moto) and network range. - Decades of experience.  

I don't care much from which place a phone is manufactured be it india china etc. I want good quality for the price i pay.  

I had the Micromax canvas 2 a110 before, that thing had a massive battery drain, lack of OS updates, build quality was okay when compared to the moto g, touch screen ghost touches when connected to a charger. Also had a visit to the service center to get the touch fixed and had a wonderful(/s) time there.    
These problems don't get addressed really well when you rebrand a phone, because you had no say in the manufacturing. You just put a stock rom with bloatware and ship for a good price.  

So in-short rebranding is okay, but as a company you will never grow.  
And atleast if you are rebranding optimize, optimize and optimize the Software.  
Thats the least you could do if you sell a rebranded phone.  

EDIT - the cam in the canvas 2 was good though! :)   




 I'm okay with what they do.  
It's just a personal choice that I'll not buy another rebranded product. Would buy the original source itself if I wanted too.   
They did capture the market for a long time now and it's time to up the game.    
Tag line Nothing like anything, but there is something like it elsewhere XD    




 i noticed a variation of this but i really cant reproduce it now.  
Few days back i had a stable wifi connection but without internet and firing up Nightly41 would take sooooo loooong for the window to show up.   




 Micromax has NO engineering.   
If it was their company introduction products this approach was fine. Since it's been a looooooong time they've been In the market, they better start doing some shit of their own instead of rebranding stuff.   
Completely fed-up with this.  




 hopefully this helps, no native way to do it for now - https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/992152

 have you tried, resetting the browser or creating a new profile(Backup data)?

https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-firefox-profiles  
  
 




 You can try out the beta 64bit release for now https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/beta/all/  
It can be used as a daily driver.   




 Cost, specs and updates   
Also good open source record and custom roms.  
























 its easier for apple because they control every aspect of the hardware on which Safari runs.  Its probably hard to do this on firefox or chrome since it runs on a variety of hardware; but yeah there could be optimizations done to make it better :)   




 by black do you mean graphic glitches?  
i'd suggest you to update your graphic card(s) drivers and check it out if its occurring.  

Also you could do a refresh(you'll lose add-ons) if problems seem to take place within safe-mode as well.   




 * 3. there mostly a nomodeset option listed in the boot parameters for that specific boot entry. (Be warned of trying to remove it - You can edit it in grub menu by pressing 'e; make it permanent by editing /etc/grub2.cfg) 




 i have a dell too. And yes Lenovo is the best! :D  

Thing is you need to have both cards to be enabled to use bumblebee. Your manufacturer has allowed a bios option to use specifically one; which is good in a way since you can choose what your want, but you'll have to reboot and set it again if you want to use the other.  

What bumblebee does is, it auto-manages both the cards on the fly; most of the time intel will be active(as it does all normal stuff fine, and is light on battery) while the Nvidia card is used for heavy graphics apps(Heavy on battery and heating).  

You can specifically have bumblebee run on the heavy Nvidia card by using the optirun command for an app (eg. optirun firefox).  
Also having primus installed gives a slight improved performance over the default optirun.    

I feel its a win-win situation and the user is well in control. :)     




 wait i guess :| 




 https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/3d5aun/so_i_was_hanging_onto_firefox_for_one_reason_and/ct1xs3f 




 JUST DO IT! Anything is Possible! 




  Google one of the main donors for Mozilla.

They rely on yahoo now. 




 Thank you so much! This works! :D :D :D 




 also do you have any other driver installed from anyother source for your nvidia? 




 yes it will work! :)  

First have a clean install done.  
Next follow the instruction on that page; by installing all the dependencies etc. and the proceed to install bumblebee, bbswitch, bumblebee-nvidia (driver).  
After that reboot the system, login and wait for sometime; it'll compile and load in the background(you can notice this when your fan starts to slow down and system begins to cool).  
If things are working great and you use heavy graphic intensive apps install primus which is listed on the same page  

I can root for bumblebee. I've used it for a long time and its working great a long long time! :)  

I can help you out if you need.  
 




 Is it a dual gpu system, Optimus technology, nvidia+Intel? 
If that's the case you'll need bumblebee.  

Follow this guide for bumblebee, use the proprietary driver for better performance.  
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Bumblebee  

If it's a normal nvidia card, a package from rpm fusion will certainly do the job.    




 Yes you can. Mint might include in its default repository.  
I'm not sure where you can download it but perhaps Google will help you out.   
It works great for me on Fedora. Also you might need to create a tiny file to enable sub-pixel rendering(patent blocks to ship by default)  

Edit - i tried a bit of looking around. could find any right links(some key words like libfreetype). Maybe it has a different package name for ubuntu based distros. Perhaps you'll have to stick with infinality(which is really good and more customizable).  




 I'm not sure but I heard they are packaging a new version for w10, why don't you try that out?   




 Similar usage, Firefox works great!  




 Freetype-freeworld is also a saviour  




 Try using Uninstaller from Adobe site and then try installing flash again.  




 Try safe mode?   




 Yesterday you said tomorrow :( 




 Second this. As the world goes more and more towards portability a good browser with the minimum effect on battery will be the clear victor.  




 yeah i'm looking for a vid in which the initial sparks/discharge starts between clouds(hopefully a close up video).  
i've searched youtube and pics but never got the results :( 




 They did a kickstarter, animation support will come in soon  




 check in safe mode? 




 they pay adobe for that

if it affects youtube playback you can have it disabled.

 I hope your issue gets some attention. Lot of graphic cards act in weird ways.

 




 haha xD i understand what you mean ; but as they are concerned about national "security" its better to develop stuff in house 




 Keeping every aspect of pro-privacy aside.  

Total Stupidity; to buy or even think of buying "hacking software" from an overseas firm that deals with several other govt.(s) behind your backs.  
This is buying yourself into stuxnet. An easy deal.  
You get bugged and you get looted as well  

If you're so interested make your own.   




 this sounds good, an option in preference will do fine.

 it actually should boot normally. This is very strange.   
Since you got a screen then i don't understand why you should'nt get a screen now.  

Worst part is you're not getting ther terminal too :(   




 No text too?   

Can ya add nomodeset option to the boot parameter?  
You can add it at the bootloader by adding parameter before the OS is loaded. i guess by pressing 'e'.   
on this line ' GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash nomodeset" ' 




 i think you need to have windows media player installed to have codecs on your system  

Choose a version appropriate for your OS:  
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/download-windows-media-player  

I hope this helps 




 on the login screen can you see the small gear icon? choose gnome classic and try to log in 




 thats strange;  

Are you of the EU region?  




 alright goto about:config and set these to true:  

media.mediasource.enabled  
media.mediasource.format-reader.mp4  
media.mediasource.mp4.enabled  
media.format-reader.mp4  
media.fragmented-mp4.enabled  
media.fragmented-mp4.exposed  

Set this to false:  
media.mediasource.webm.enabled  

Note - incase there are some entries here not present in the about:config, skip em.
 




 OS please? 




 can you stay online for some time? can proceed faster that way   




 alright, so you get no visual after logging in.  

Try Ctrl+Alt+F3 (or F4/F5/F6)  
and login

Also: try move your move and see when you get a blank screen when you switch if you dont get a text console   




 are you able to stay in the desktop? Meaning you get the GUI and stay logged in?   




 Try a restart   
boot into the OS now without the live USB Stick.  
Are you able to get a desktop?  
Can you log-in to the user account you created during install?   
Are you connected to the internet?  
If you can get the terminal or ctrl alt f2 gets you a terminal type in "lspci |grep -i VGA" and put the output here.   




 startpage then :) 




 correction you will need bumblebee later on.  
Thats the only way your card will work.  F-up by nvidia and lack of progress on the open-source end as well.  
So bumblebee is the way to go; no worries shall help set it up! :) 




 /u/Baliverbes has remoded the kernel arguments and blacklisted stuff  
It might be a issue to get any display   




 alright!  

Mount is like unlocking a gate to enter it, umount is the opposite.  

Once you get the desktop back, time to rock and roll 




 ah not the right way.   

Use the live USB and i think you can format via the installer there.   
There should be an option hidden during the partition selection thing.  
If there's nothing there then in the desktop version of Live USB(not installer) use the disk utility to format.  
You might have to umount the harddisk for it to happen.   




 alright, since i think we are diving head-first into re-installation.   

Suggest you to format the disk first to erase everything(Back up using live boot USB if you have anything important on the HD)    
Then let the auto partitioner take care of the job to split up the disk or you can do that your-self if you have the experience.   

Wait until system installs and buzz back here. 




 Are you still using a usb stick to boot?
If so stop that and boot via the bootloader menu.  
And continue to undo any changes you've made   

Uninstall command:  
sudo dnf autoremove Packagename


The easier way is to definitely reinstall, but you'll have to reinstall all your apps again.  
If you have a speedy connection then that's good


REINSTALL:  
You should get everything back after a clean format and reinstall.  
Remember to make sure of the partition things in windows if this is a dual boot, since there is a strong chance of losing the bootloader.    

Once you completely reinstalled then buzz back here.  
I'lll guide you through installing the driver.  
Same optimus stuff on my laptop.

 alright the problem should be that the drivers you installed are already there on the system.  

Do you remember the way you installed them?  
If you do; undo all the things you have done so far.  
For starters uninstall the nvidia driver you already installed.   

If you did via the terminal, then hitting the "up arrow" will show you your previous commands for that particular user account.   




 i tried with a theme called Zukitwo and those lines dont appear after scrolling.  

These Dotted lines don't disappear after the scrolling is completed. They remain there.  
Its particularly annoying on the transmission where you get a rectangle on the top and bottom of the scroll list.

 Hope to help you out:  
Are you able to access the desktop now? or are you stuck with a black and white screen with a bunch of text ?

 i upgraded from F21 - F22  
Thought it might be fixed in the next few updates. Nothing has happened so far.  
Gnome version is 3.16.2; adwaita-gtk2-theme-3.16.2-1.fc22.x86_64   
It also happens in the light version of the theme (Non-Dark) 




 the dark version of the default theme Adwaita

Some things are not a specific standard and supporting things like that will do more harm than good later on.  
Firefox is steadily improving on the html5 adoption as well.  

 




 Im having a bunch of these "-------------" dotted lines at the top and bottom of any gtk3 app.  
They appear after scrolling up and down.  

Nautilus, Transmission, Evince everything is affected

 Great! :)   

Bottom right red is okay, webM needs development.  
The other parameters it's okay if you don't have em, I was reporting from a nightly version so it might not have landed.   
Check for codecs is a nice idea, maybe the team should be notified about it, but I'm not sure how it is going to be.   

Anyway happy YouTubeing!  




 alright i hope you are on the latest version of firefox.  

And if you are of the EU region then probably you are missing codecs on the system then you'll need to install windows media player.

Not sure if its a guaranteed solution, also check out the bug report mentioned in the thread. Could help you out.  

Im on Nightly gtk3. Readability issues still exist but many improvements are happening on the gtk3 end :)  
Incase you want to take it out for a spin - http://glandium.org/blog/?p=3555 




 do you have any add-ons that affect playback?  
Could you check in safe mode and see if this happens 




 hey!

Try avoiding the the dark themes for now.  
Fedora 22 ships with gtk3 build as default and it isnt complete as yet.  

There was a post on /r/fedora to fix certain annoyances.  
If you have the time look it up.  
I shall try to link it here if i find them! 




 Off-Topic:  
Hey! could you check about this comment issue? https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/3c9zds/whats_new_with_firefox_390/csufsgp 




 ah thanks for this info, i see your point clearly!  
I guess its being actively worked on.  
have your reported this on bugzilla? 




 The nibs wear away fast; so its better to place a sheet of paper on top of the tablet or even a thing plastic sheet. Be gentle :) 




 I like a lot of whats posted here! :D  
Hope it makes it to release on desktop and android! :D 




 ah maybe its an asia thing :/  
Intuos is great! if you can manage the price then i guess it'll be perfect.  
Im using Fedora 22 so it ships with the near latest kernel :)   




 only webM has problems(Still in development), mp4 works great actually on YouTube  




 oh repo updates, some can take a looooong while.  
 




 this = http://www.wacom.asia/onebywacom/ 




 i have a wacom one, the smaller sized version :) 




 have a look at the comment below 




 Disable "media.mediasource.webm.enabled" in about:config have these set to 'true':  
media.mediasource.enabled  
media.mediasource.mp4.enabled  
media.fragmented-mp4.exposed  
media.fragmented-mp4.ffmpeg.enabled  
media.fragmented-mp4.gmp.enabled  

Verify at www.youtube.com/html5

Maybe the potential is limited in the beginning, but they can always work on that 




   Maybe, but not by default. And not at 1080p.

You can! :)
 




 it will be for quite a while, as long as flash games and flash ads exist on the the internet 




 :) you're welcome 




 webM is under development. Its better not to enable it, unless you want to provide bug reports.   

You'll need to have these set to true to have different quality:  
media.fragmented-mp4.exposed; media.fragmented-mp4.ffmpeg.enabled; media.fragmented-mp4.gmp.enabled  

Verify your settings on www.youtube.com/html5 




 I got a Wacom one, works great!  
Plug and play, no driver hunting, nothing.    
Just use it!  




 Scrolling issues will be fixed in the upcoming releases. They are working hard to implement asynchronous pan and zoom  




 ow :( i hope this get resolved soon
 




 someone else reported the same issue on a reddit post. I think for a temp solution you could zoom out on the newtab page to get your links back 




 ah good :)
Happy Youtubing! :) 




 have a look at the solution below  




 it mostly should. incase it does do report back! :) 




 disable webM. 
Its under development  

Goto about:config and set this to false  
"media.mediasource.webm.enabled"
