EDIT: Never mind I see it now....
 




 Well that escalated quickly. 




 I think this has more to do with your tastes maturing rather than just the fact of more exposure. If I hate something I hate it no matter how much I'm exposed to it; only if my tastes and attitudes change will my opinions change.  




 No. Just no.

 Pikachu main, here. I use the c-stick for quick down smashes (roll + down smash is king). Whenever I want to charge a smash I use direction + A.

I'd say it's more personal preference than anything, I know some great players who don't use the c-stick at all. I have found, though, that all the insane players I know ALL use the c-stick. So it would seem that it is your friends that are the noobs and you that are the pro. 

C-stick is also invaluable for directional air attacks. Pikachu's are amazing, so I use the c-stick A LOT for that.

 Why girls need to lie about this stuff is beyond me.

 You come across a child drowning in a river.
Would you rather save the child's life and have no one know what you did, or fail to save to save his/her life (even if you could) and be forever known as the hero who tried? 




 In Asian countries they have a plastic bin right next to the trash meant for liquids. Why they don't have that here is beyond me.

 Not on campus, but pretty sure I might have seen it off campus near Shadyside or up Craig Street. Lots of buildings that look similar close to CMU.  




 You are NOT overqualified for anything. Get your ass out there and work!

 haha sorry, I actually am almost out. I know quite a few people who have more than a hundred dollars left though :) 




 This design was submitted.
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/29374/Sample.png
Who could possibly say that the design that was chosen is better than this one? The quality of the submissions was not the problem here. 




 Not very good, the teacher is pretty bad and doesn't teach econ very well. Fortunately, I took AP Micro in high school, so I was able to do well. 
It's not a particularly hard class, so if you're able to get through her B.S. teaching you'll be able to get an A.  




 I can't believe CMU ended up with this design. With our amazing design and arts school, I never expected this would happen. 
The petition that was created the first day of voting did nothing, and the creator of the petition was told to take it down because it might offend the creators of the design. I highly doubt anything we do at this point would be able to change anything.  




 it's bytes, like I said CMU's internet is INSANE. 
and Donner looks super ugly from the outside but it's pretty nice inside.  




 I live in Donner, which is really nice, coed by wing (west and east), largest rooms for a double, walls are pretty thick here. Apparently Stever is considered one of the worst freshman dorms so if you liked it you should be fine anywhere. Morewood has the smallest rooms though, almost tiny compared to mine. 

The internet here is AMAZING, I get ~13 mbps download speed on WIFI which in my opinion is incredible. Yes, sometimes it cuts out randomly for like half a minute but it's infrequent enough that it's not a nuisance. Ethernet is the most stable, never ever had it cut out but I get slower download speeds ~10 mbps. You have a 50 Gb download limit for 5 days but you will never EVER go over it, I download large files constantly and have no problem (I once redownloaded my entire steam library and was fine). There are gaming clubs, not sure if for CS:GO but I'm sure you could form one easily.  




 Red 9. You won't be eating very much here, even though there's no buffets except Shatz they give you a lot of food. I'm a dude that normally eats a lot and these blocks fill me up to the point where I only need to eat two meals a day and a few snacks I can buy at entropy. Red 9 gives you $720 DineX which is more than you should ever need (most people don't use it all, and I actually have to make an effort to spend all of it by the semester).

 Yeah my garage has been duplicating my cars too... weird.  




 From what I've heard the Surface 2 is only a few hundredths of an inch thinner than the Surface RT, so thinness isn't really that big of a difference. Apparently the weight difference is quite nice, though I haven't had any problems with the weight of my RT. I got my 64 GB RT for $200 and I feel no incentive to upgrade to the 2 except for the better screen. I think $250-$200 is the perfect price point for the Surface RT 




 I have the AMD Radeon HD 6630M and I can run at at 40-50 fps. Just run it and play around with the settings a bit.  




 Surface RT runs on flash memory, not a hard drive, so the slowdown shouldn't be from there. Did you run Windows Update multiple times? The updates fix a lot of the lag/slowness issues.  




 Those floors are only accessible by CS students. If you have a friend in the CS department, just have them open the door for you. The elevators work the same way too. 

Or you could get lucky and "conveniently" walk in after someone opens the door.

* Max Payne Bundle
* F.E.A.R. 3

Willing to trade any or all my keys for any of these games 1:1. Or counteroffers I'm not particularly picky.  




 I have three copies of Killing Floor as Steam Gifts, includes the game and Defence Alliance 2. Looking for any offers.  




 Just give IE a try. I was skeptical at first too but it really is a great touch experience in tablet mode.  




 Realistically, what do you use NFC for? And why is it so important that if it doesn't have it it's a deal breaker?

Not bashing, just curious. I think NFC is a great tool but I haven't found any practical applications of it that would make it a deciding factor in purchasing a tablet or phone.  




 MathXL puts the CORRECT answer in the box after you get it wrong, so the answer in the blue box is NOT what you input. If you mouse over the box a window will pop up saying "Your answer: _______." I'm sorry but I'm 100% certain you input the y = which is technically an incorrect answer.  




 Well the y = is already given... so technically you DID input the wrong answer. 

I know, I hate MathXL as much as anyone else, but you just gotta learn how to deal with the annoyances.  




 Bought one of these and it did come in original packaging. It arrived packaged and presented as if I had bought it direct from Microsoft.

 Thank you! Did they really give you a dining table and a couch?? 




 Yup, I know that. I wouldn't expect them to give that to us. 




 What appliances are included in the Fairfax kitchens? Fullsize fridge, oven, stove, microwave, sink? There's no information on the housing page.

 Stark didn't say it was vibration proof, he said it *absorbed* all vibrations, meaning the shield can still vibrate but none of that energy is transferred to the wearer. Big difference.  




 I see. In which case decide whether a college degree is really worth it to you. If you foresee yourself getting a better job/being happier once you get a degree then go for it. I don't want you to be like "well what do I do now?" after you graduate.  




 You should go only because of the fact that it's a unique and rewarding experience. College is a unique experience because everyone there is living together and striving to achieve the same objective - the only other place like that is the military. The lessons, skills, and friends that you have there makes it well worth your time.  




 There was an incident that happened during Orientation Week at my school... it is now known as the "Brown Leg Incident."

During the first night of school a guy invited a girl to his room, and they began to get down and dirty. His roommate was trying to sleep on the top bunk and got so fed up that he left to sleep in the lounge. One of the RA's walked by and asked him what was going on, and together they went to investigate the room. 

While the two lovebirds were alone they had switched to anal sex, and were going at it full force when his roommate opened the door. The shock from the door opening and the ongoing sex caused her to unleash her bowels in full force all over the guy's leg, and due to crappy school food it was runny and full-on disgusting. We all ran out of our rooms from the sound and saw the couple covered in shit and fully embarrassed. 

Both students switched dorms after that.  




 On the thumbnail it looks like his nose is made of a dirt block.

 DOUBLE RAINBOW ALL THE WAAAAAAY 




 stoopid hooman...

 "Destitute Tier" haha 




 He doesn't really do a lot of fast action stuff except for the small amount of fighting at the end (that he doesn't do very well in). I'm sure you can get a clean, smooth picture but I'm most worried about the lag making it impossible to play shooters or faster paced games. Thanks anyways though.  




 My god look at that tiny HUD size. 




 How playable is it? Is there any lag/is it manageable?

 Oh my god, those visually similar images....

 How do you get Samurize to work? Are you still on XP? 




 You have to install all available updates first before it shows up in the store.  




 Just try not using your laptop for a while and see if you can live without it. Only you can tell whether it will be a viable replacement for you.  




 No. 




 I think it's time to look into the pros and cons of using each product in real life rather than just the pros and cons of the computers themselves. If you're gonna be bringing it to class, the Alienware is going to be WAY too huge. I'd go with the blade. In my experience with college, portability and battery life are just SO incredibly important. If you do get the Alienware I would look into also getting a companion tablet or light netbook for you to bring to class with the money you save. They're both great computers that serve slightly different purposes (powerful all around computer vs. desktop replacement). Make your call while considering your lifestyle (do you plan on sitting in your room or going to the library to do work, lan parties with friends, etc.) and how you plan on using your computer (take it to class or leave it in your room). 

Also, technically it's not their first PC, as they have the Razer Blade Pro that was released a few years ago.  




 Even a $30 is WAY too much to spend on a screen protector. Just get a $5 to $10 one if one at all. I don't have a screen protector on my RT and it's just fine. My type cover protects it while in my bag.    




 Future economist right here.   




 Could be a one? 




 Let's blatantly overgeneralize an entire subset of people, that'll go over well.  




 It's a sorority hand sign. Forget which one in particular. 




 The Blade Pro is an outdated system by now. The new Razer Blade is the one you want to get. Switchblade is an old gimmicky system that most games don't support and is a feature I'd pay to get RID of, not to have. There's a reason they haven't updated the Pro/added Switchblade to the new Razer Blade.  














 I also have a stand-alone mic, not in the Picture. One of those Yeti microphones.  




 I do have Razer Surround, it sounds great.  




 I have it dual-booted to Ubuntu, I just need Windows for gaming.  




 This keyboard is AMAZING, much better than any membrane or chiclet keyboard in my opinion. The only downside is it's VERY loud, really clacky especially if you type fast (of courss, this could be seen as an upside to most people). If you have roommates or if you think you'll be bothered by the sound I'd recommend asking for the Steath version which uses different switches to be quieter. Personally, it doesn't bother me or my roommate and I kinda like the sound it makes. 




 Not sure? It's just a background I found when browsing google images. Link the the wallpaper has been provided on this thread already.  




 Yes, I have a pair of Audio Technica ATH-M50s. I am interested in getting a pair of actual gaming headphones, though. The Razer Kraken 7.1 looks really nice at a reasonable price.  




 It's a Cooler Master Notepal U2 Laptop Cooling Pad, found [here](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834997730).  




 Yes, I LOVE this keyboard, I had the 2012 model before and just recently upgraded to this one (2013) with the Cherry MX Blues. It is very noisy, and I do have one roommate. Fortunately, he doesn't seem to mind it unless he's trying to sleep and I'm still up typing something. I guess it just depends on who you have as a roommate.  




 I made the Rainmeter skin myself, I will be posting it on /r/Rainmeter soon. Look for it there! 




 I do use my laptop screen frequently, but I would be interested in getting a stand to slide my keyboard under when I'm not using it. Thanks for the idea! 




 It's a skin I made myself actually. I am thinking of posting it onto /r/Rainmeter soon. Look for it there! 




 I prefer it for sure. It kinda braces your hand and wrist and allows for finer mouse movements. 




 I'm not really sure? It's been a long time since I've had it installed, so I don't really remember.  




 I am studying hard; I go to one of the country's best Computer Science schools. This is just a small hobby of mine, I don't intend to build some insane computer-built-into-desk-with-liquid-cooling-and-leds system. Just some suggestions on computer placement or small changes or some stuff that I haven't thought about would be nice.  




 Yeah, I re-installed windows and didn't install the beats audio drivers after. Honestly, beats doesn't sound all that bad on my laptop; I even think it makes the sound from the built-in speakers sound better. You can disable the equalizer and tweak the bass and stuff so it doesn't sound bad. 

But yes I do have it completely uninstalled and it sounds pretty much the same.  




 It's windows 8 with the programs Rainmeter and Stardock Objectdock. Objectdock gives me that menu on the left and Rainmeter gives me the bar on top and right side and the date and time in the middle. 

I actually have my laptop dual-booted for Ubuntu, which I prefer over Windows 8 for web browsing and stuff like that. When I want to game I switch over to Windows.  




 It uses a lot less bandwidth than Skype does, so in that sense it's better. Whether you like the sound quality is up to personal preference; Razer Comms tries to make your voice stand out above in-game audio but it can make it sound a little harsh and unnatural in my opinion. Just try it out and see what you think! 




 [Here](http://wlppr.com/wallpapers/2010/06/14/Slides_of_light.2880x1800.jpg) you go! 




 I would totally get a different desk if I could, but as this one came with the dorm I would rather stick with it. Plus I wouldn't have a way of keeping the desk for next year. For now, this is what I have.  




 HP Envy 14 Beats Edition. Not exactly the best laptop, it's about 2 years old. Definitely getting a new one soon.  









 Is it just me or does this cat look a little like Wall-E? 




 I see what you did there.  




 This article talks about having the battery *constantly* at 100%. As long as you let the battery go through charge cycles decently regularly (let the battery discharge to maybe 20% at least once a month) you shouldn't have an issue with reduced battery life.  
























 The keyboard the keyboard the keyboard. The keyboard will be a HUGE step up from a simple microsoft membrane. Besides, you already have a headset you like, that upgrade won't be nearly as impressive as the jump to mechanical. 

As for your worries about mechanical keyboards:

* Don't worry about it disturbing you when you play. It won't, besides you use a headset so you'll barely be able to hear it. 
* Don't worry about you not liking it. Unless you are in a VERY small minority, you will absolutely love it and you will wonder how you ever typed without one. 

You can always return it if you REALLY don't like it. Go for the keyboard. You won't regret it.   




 Cash can be used anywhere that currency can purchase goods.  




 What case is that?

 How do these compare to the Invisible Shields? I got two anyways but I'd like to know.

 Try completely uninstalling Synapse and seeing if the keyboard functions as usual. If it doesn't, I think it would be time to send an email to Razer Support.

 Can you really play BF4 on the Edge? What graphics settings and what FPS do you get? 




 To get more rows of tiles on the start screen, go to settings  tiles  show more tiles and tick to yes. On my RT I get four rows instead of three.  




 I'd love a few to repair my old beat-up controllers :)

 And this is news because....? 




 EDIT: Holy shit, Gold! Thank you so much kind stranger! I figured that comment would get buried for sure! 




 I totally agree. Intel does offer more performance but bang-for-buck AMD is much better. As a college student on a budget that's what I went with. I have my 6300 OC'd to 4.7 GHz and it performs very well; at this point the only CPU I'd upgrade to is an i7-4770k, which would require a new mobo and quite a bit more money. I'm happy where I am right now.  




 It wouldn't be too much more expensive, and it would allow you to add more things in the future if you would like.  




 Better graphics card comes to mind first, then a power supply with more wattage. That's really about it. 

Keep in mind this is a MICRO build, more for portability than anything. If space isn't an issue, get a larger case and a better mobo.  




 You could go with an R9 280X for $100 more and have a PC that will last you for a long time.  




 I built a killer mid-range gaming pc (plays most games like BF4 maxed) for $800 or so just a few months ago so you should be fine with the cash you have set aside. I've posted pcpartpicker below. 

I got a lot of my parts with good deals which is why the total price is a little high.

 Thanks! 




 I mean sure, why not? It's just putting a custom case on a shelf above your desk.   




 Way to ruin it with the title.  




 Ah man, that sucks. Didn't know that was specific to the first generations.  




 Works for me on my RT + Touch Cover 1. You have to tap pretty fast and hold down the second tap.  




 Double-tap then drag. 




 I looked into it more and found that I do have DDR3 memory running at 1333 MHz. It seems that I was looking at the DRAM frequency.  




 I see, it seems I don't know enough about memory. Thank you for the clarification! 




 How much would you be willing to sell two of your 4GB PC3-10600s? 




 I would like to get at least 2 x 4 GB PC3 10600 or PC3 12800 (1333 or 1600 MHz) ram kits at around $30 or so. Anyone have old laptop memory meeting these requirements? Shoot me an offer!
 




 I think people SEVERELY underestimate the value of the touch covers. Here's why:

* Absolutely NO moving parts/greater durability. This is so much better for travel or general "beater" use as there are fewer things to break or get caught in. 

* Greater spill resistance. Spilling liquids on a Type Cover would require a lot more recovery than with a Touch Cover. Unless you've managed to soak it all the way through, a simple wipe-down with a paper towel is all you need to clean a simple Touch Cover spill. 

* Thinner. I know at this point we're talking millimeters of difference but the Touch Covers (especially Touch Cover 2) just feel so much lighter. 

Unless you do a LOT of typing (I'm talking multi-page essays or university assignments), the Touch Cover will be FAR more useful. A thin lightweight cover for your Surface that's good enough for banging out a few emails or urls when needed. 

To directly answer your concern, you can just tap the trackpad anywhere to register a left click and tap with two fingers to register a right click. No need to ever use those dinky buttons below the trackpad.  




 I have a stock cooler from an FX 6300 never installed. Name your price.  




 I love the Surface as much as anyone in the subreddit but I gotta say that ultrabook looks top notch... I would honestly go with that. The slightly better resolution and screen size does it for me. 

I have a Surface RT but I still prefer the traditional laptop/ultrabook build for a primary portable work computer. Sure I know it's basically the same thing with a type cover but the 10.6 inch screen is a *little* too small for heavy working for my taste.  




 Honestly this ultrabook would have pretty much the exact same portability of a surface.  




 Yes, but there are adapters that you can buy to get an ethernet port. 
 




 I upgraded from the Blackwidow Ultimate 2012 edition to the 2013 edition and that was very much worth it. If you have nothing else I say go for it! 




 Just take a look around, they don't really have THAT many products. Only then will you know if there's some really cool looking headset or mouse that other people don't recommend. 

Having said that, though, I recommend:

* Razer Black Widow Ultimate 2013 Edition Keyboard (BF4 edition if you really want it, but I like the clean Razer green)

* Razer Mamba Mouse. (this is the category where you should REALLY look around yourself, they have TONS of awesome mice.)

* Razer Kraken 7.1 Headset. 

Again, just take a look and see what really suits you.  




 Date and time skin at the center is [Metro Desk X](http://exsess.deviantart.com/art/Metro-Desk-X-v0-8-ALPHA-366743811). Top bar and side bar are custom skins created myself.  









 Try unplugging the keyboard, restarting your computer, and plugging your keyboard back in after your computer has completely booted up again.  




 I don't really see the difference between the two questions? Sure, the second one is more specific but a good reviewer will talk about how the workload impacts social life when asked just the first question (because it's the greatest factor in how social you are). Same for most questions on the page, they sound like generic questions any freshman or college review websites would ask. 




 For comparison here is the same model sold on [eBay](http://www.ebay.com/itm/171011545519?ssPageName=STRK:MEWAX:IT _trksid=p3984.m1423.l2649). This is a FANTASTIC monitor well worth the money. Good luck on the sale! 
























 I'm having problems running the hack... The game freezes right when I hit start after character select. I have tried running from an SD card and a USB drive. When using the USB drive the light on the drive blinks indicating it's in use but nothing happens even after 10 minutes. I have also tried recompiling the ISO. The ISO is loaded using Nintendont.

Any help? 




 No, this is a Let's Play! 




 Which monitor mount are you using? I would like to run a similar setup (one landscape one portrait).  




 His look of defeat afterward... so sad.  




 They've spawned in Zombies on creative mode in Minecraft before so maybe it wouldn't be. All up to Geoff though.

 I'd say social life is really depended on each individual. If you want to have fun and be around people, then you will find people that want the same. If you just like to work, then you can do that. 

The social scene is definitely here, and if you want to be a part of it then you can. You will do a fair share of work here but most people take it in stride and have great social lives in addition to the work they do. 

Hope that answered your question.

 Congratulations on getting in! Carnegie Mellon is a great school, and I'm sure you will have a great and fulfilling time here should you choose to come. 

To answer your questions:

The professors here are extremely receptive to undergraduate research. Really all you need to do is ask. I knew quite a few people my freshman year who did some really cool research projects, including building and programming a small boat that could guide itself across a pond and someone who was programming the software for a missile defense system. Really neat stuff, and all you need to do is ask. 

Professors in different departments tend not to share too many different classes, but as an ECE/CS student you will be taking classing in pretty much all of the colleges. 

You have the option of transferring from ECE to CS if you want to, and many people try to. However, you should keep in mind that the CS department is extremely selective and admittance rates, even from internal transfers, are extremely low. If you want to transfer to CS, I'd advise you talk to your adviser ASAP to get that process underway. 

The language program here is really great! I take Mandarin, and know many people taking Japanese. We have really great professors, small classes for a really personal experience (my Mandarin class has 7 people in it right now) and a great curriculum that really helps you learn the language. There are many options for study abroad over the summer and they offer many scholarships so you don't even have to pay. 

Again, congrats on getting accepted. If you have anymore questions feel free to reply or PM me.

 It's actually 33.3%. 3 + (.333 x 3) = 4. 3 + (.25 x 3) = 3.75.

And the damage reduction is when it's NOT locked onto a pilot. So presumably lock amounts will stay the same. Who knows what the damage reduction is.  




 I'm looking for a 128 GB SSD for around $50-$60 or a reasonable price for a smaller SSD. Not really looking to spend any more than that, but if you have a 240 GB drive for $80 or so (I know, super unlikely, but hey might as well ask) I may consider it.

Let's see those offers! 




 Sent you the wrong one, sorry. Try the one I just sent! 




 PM sent. 




 Thanks so much! 




 Thanks! 




 I like your other game icons too! Can I get a link to some of them? 




 Thank god there's no "Over 75 Awards Won" icon on the cover. Damn that was annoying to look at.  




 Nope.  




 Got one of these [beepers](http://www.thinkgeek.com/product/b278/) and hid it in a friend's car. I actually forgot about it for a few months and remembered only when he came up to me and told me he had maintenance done on his car because he thought something was wrong with it. 

I then proceeded to take the beeper out of his car and hide it in other places for a week or two at a time: in his fridge, in his desk, in his backpack. He thought he was going crazy.

I started feeling really bad for him because it was really consuming his life, so I took it and didn't hide it anymore. 

But if he ever does anything to annoy me...

 I posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1uts8o/19m_my_long_distance_girlfriend_19f_was_diagnosed/) a little while ago asking for help. I have some updates to that story and I would like to hear your opinions on what I should do. 

I waited a few weeks after my first post and I sent her a card that generally said I'm sorry for what I did, I will give you space if you want space, but I am here for you if you want me to be here. It was a very kind card (at least I think so): I didn't make any implications that she should reply or anything like that, it was very neutral and she could have done whatever she wanted with it. 

She then posts on her Tumblr a few things. First, she posts this: 


 "Im tired of this. I have already made it very clear how I feel. The rest I dont think I have any obligation to explain. I am done caring."


She then deletes it maybe an hour later (I was checking it pretty obsessively) and posts this:


"There is really nothing I have to say to you, because every time I do try to think of something to say, all that comes to me are words of anger. Thats not something Id like to do, unless maybe it is really necessary for you to understand. So now the only thing I have to say is that I think the best thing to do now is just to let go and move on. I have made my peace and I will let go of whatever anger there is remaining. I have no regrets, no blame, no guilt, and no will to even try to explain anymore. I would like to move on without even the tiniest things holding me back.
Though I guess I do have one more thing. Saturday did not hurt me as much as you might think it did. So let go of whatever guilt you say you have. There is no reason to hold onto it anymore.

I get pretty angry and start to vent things on my Tumblr, which I thought she didn't know about. I said some very mean, untrue things. I was just so angry and I was writing down whatever came to my mind. 

Turns out she DID know about my Tumblr and read everything. She sends me a very angry email saying things like "obviously I was too nice, and you're taking advantage of that, you don't say these things to people to make you feel better about yourself." She legitimately thought that I wrote it in the intent that I wanted her to read it. 

Her friends messages me too, doing general "you're spewing nonsense, you obviously don't know my friend, grow up and leave her alone you don't deserve her". 

I send her friend a message explaining that I didn't know she knew about my Tumblr and that I never intended for her to read what I wrote, and that I would leave them alone. She sends a message back thanking me and saying that what I've said means a lot (not sarcastically, I think she really meant it). 

Sorry for another wall of text. I don't really like leaving anything out. 

My question now is, do you think that I should wait this out and see what happens, or do you think the situation is wrecked and I should move on? She obviously did not want to repair this even before she read what I wrote, but I know that it hasn't even been that much time since our initial argument. I know everyone said to wait a few months, but I knew I would feel like shit until I did something proactive. 

Thanks so much for all your help. 
 




 A previous post here linked [this](http://livingmanicdepressive.com/2012/08/21/relationship-falling-apart/) article. 

What do you guys think of it? Does it have any merit? 

If any of you are wondering I'm already in the "past break-up" stage and she says that she doesn't want to be with someone who is acting so selfishly (when she came to me and asked me for some time to myself I was kind of pushy and tried to talk her out of it). It's a long story and if you really want to hear it I can tell you guys. 

[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1w3fhj/my_depressed_man_broke_it_off_although_im_hurt_i/) is the original redit post.  




 Before I went to college I used to look down at my keyboard every few letters for whatever reason. Just typing a lot of essays helped me learn to touch type. It wasn't even a conscious decision to learn, it kind of just happened.

My advice is to just type a lot. If you really want to stop looking at your hands tape a piece of paper over the keyboard at the top and type with your hands under it so you can't see your hands or the keys. Alternatively, if you're truly desperate, get a keyboard with no legends. That will definitely make you learn.  




 I think they're planning one last 360 Let's Play when Minecraft gets on the Xbox One. I"m pretty sure that's what he's referencing.  




 Thanks a lot! 




 I see. Thanks so much man. I really appreciate your help.  




 Your armchair psychology is very good. Thanks so much for your help.
 




 Thanks man, your post helped a lot. This just happened to me yesterday, so yes it is very fresh. 

I am going to give her the time she needs. How long do you think I should wait? I know you said months, and I know you don't know very much about my situation, but just your opinion based on this situation would be great. 

And yes, I am prepared for that worse case scenario where she just deletes me. But right now I just want to help her in any way I can, human to human.  




 I do want to give her the space she needs and deserves, but is there anything I can do to let her know that I still care about her and that I'm still there? We left on really terrible terms and I want her to know I'm still there for her. 

I was thinking of sending her a post card every once in a while just saying hey I'm still here for you I hope you're feeling better. Nothing pushy, nothing that makes her make a decision, nothing that makes her respond. Does that sound like a good idea?  




 What I think I can do:

Obviously right now I've hurt her so much that any advance I make in the near future probably won't be received well. I think it's to the point where if she saw an email from me she would delete it right away or if she got a letter she would instantly throw it away. So attempting to contact her now is out of the question.
I feel like now I just need to remind her that I am still here. My mom thinks it's a good idea to send her something ever one in a while, like a small thing of chocolates or something like it, addressed from me so she knows that I sent it but with no other text. I think this is an okay idea. What do you think?

I still really want to apologize to her for what I did, but again, I don't think she's in the mindset to receive it. The second to last message she sent me was "This is so upsetting you need to stop this I don't want to hear it". Do you think it's a good idea for me to try to apologize, and how would I go about doing that?

 Thanks in advance for reading this and helping me out.

**BACKSTORY**

Im a sophomore in college and go to a university on the East Coast. Last summer when I was back for summer break I met what I think is the girl of my dreams. We both have our homes in the same city on the West Coast. If you asked me why I love her, I couldnt give you a definitive answer. But I know that I am the happiest when I am around her and I love her more than anyone I have ever known.

I met her only two weeks before I had to go back to college, so I tried to make the most of it. I was with her almost every day and I had the time of my life with her. When the two weeks were up I knew that I wanted to have a relationship with this girl and I wanted to ask her out in person and not wait, so I asked her out, and she said yes, and we both left on great terms.

Throughout the semester we keep in contact and talking almost every day, Skypeing and messaging each other and what not. It is during this time that I learned that she has pretty big family issues that were left unresolved when they happened (her parents got divorced and I dont think she ever learned to properly handle it, and she still has big issues with her father to this day). I was able to relate to her, since I too have had problems with my parents, and I put it in my mind that this is something to think about and maybe help her in the future.

Winter break comes and Im so excited to see her. Unfortunately, she had planned a trip to her home country Taiwan that would take up almost the entire break. So I see her twice before she left, two of the best nights of my life, and she left. We still kept in contact but it was difficult due to the time difference. We sent emails to each other every day but we talked about very serious topics. In her last email to me she made a comment saying that she thought it might not have been a good idea to enter into a relationship so quickly.

**THE MAIN PART**

She comes back from her trip and she tells me that she has time for one last visit with her. So I meet her and I can tell pretty much right away that something is wrong.

She tells me that late last semester she was diagnosed with depression and that her father is abusive (her words, not mine). And she tells me that she needs time to sort things out by herself. I ask her what she means by needing time and she says that she cant handle a relationship right now and that she doesnt want me to contact her or talk to her.

I preface this next part by saying at that point I had no clue about how to talk to someone or help someone with depression. I know now that what I did was completely and utterly wrong and hurt her more than I can imagine. But back to the story.

Naturally I do not like what she is telling me. I felt terrible that the person I loved was diagnosed with depression and felt so hurt by the fact that she didnt want to keep in contact with me and talk to me. Again, this is before I knew that people with depression push the people they love away. So I told her that I dont think I can do that, especially now that I know that youre sick, and that I want to be there for her and help her overcome her depression. And she kept saying no, that she needs time, which is something someone with depressions would do. I got so frustrated and angry that she didnt want me that I stormed out on her. I know. Bad call.

I sent her a text that night saying I was sorry for leaving the way I did and that I am there for her whenever she needs me. She sends a text back saying shes sorry too and that hopefully were both a lot happier when we see each other again.

The next day I wrote and sent her a physical letter saying basically that I dont expect a response, Im sorry for being an ass and that if you say you need time, you need time, Im scared that you will forget about me, I love you and I will miss you, please dont forget about me. I also said that I dont think you have to do it this way and that it hurts me that you are doing this to me. I know, I know, the absolute wrong thing to say.

Wednesday she gets my letter and immediately sends me an email. Here is the most relevant bit.


"When we talked, what I really needed was your support, your patience, your understanding, and your respect. And I feel that I didnt get any of that. I had hoped that you would understand, but now I feel like you havent even tried. I didnt do this to hurt you. In part I was trying to protect you, but I was also trying to protect myself, something I need to do. How could you think that this is something that Ive done to you? I dont blame you for anything. But I honestly cannot understand how selfish and immature you are acting. You say that you care, but right now you are hurting me rather than helping me. I cannot be with someone who acts this way. I see very clearly now that we cant be in a relationship. This is not how love works.

I have only one request. Please do not make this even more difficult for me. Please just leave me alone. Youll get better and youll move on and live your life. You will.

I wont forget the memories we made because they were good memories, but now its time to move on. I really do wish the best for you.


Naturally, I go ballistic. I called her, left her a pathetic voicemail, emailed her back three times, recorded a pathetic video and sent it to her, and messaged her on Facebook. In short, I didnt do what she wanted.

She unfriends me from Facebook and I ask to her to not unfriend me. Im trying to talk to her, saying things like Youre right. I dont understand, but I cant if you do this. Please help me understand, I want to be here for you. It gets so bad that she messages me, in all caps, JUST LEAVE ME ALONE.

And so I stop. And thats the last interaction Ive had with her.

**WHAT I THINK NOW**

From what Ive read online, and looking back at what I did, I did the exact opposite of what she needed me to do. She needed me to understand, but I was too blinded by wanted to keep this relationship that I wouldnt listen to her until she had to scream it over Facebook. She did what people with depression do, and I didnt see that and tried to talk her out of it and blame her, which is the absolute opposite of what she needed. I know what I did hurt her so much.

At this point, Im not concerned with getting back together with her. At this point I just want her to be better. From what Ive heard her depression is severe to the point where it is hurting her physical well being in that she can barely make it through a day without almost collapsing. And friends that are complete strangers to her have seen her on campus have told me that she looks miserable and that theres something wrong, even though I hadnt told them anything about this. She doesnt have very many close friends, and she hasnt told her parents about her depression because partly, theyre the cause. Im pretty sure I am one of the very few (or maybe the ONLY) person she has trusted this information with.

I know she cares about me or she wouldnt be acting this way. But Im not concerned with that right now. All I want is to be a good person and help her in any way I can. I still care so much about her, but my goal is not to get her back. My only goal is to help her get better. My question is how do I do that?

Thanks for reading my incredibly long post, and thanks for the help you give. I will be here on my computer all day so if you have any more questions just ask and I will respond quickly.

A note: she has said the she has been visiting a therapist, so she is getting help professionally. Im asking what I can do personally to help her.

**TL;DR** My girlfriend was diagnosed with depression that is severe to the point of it harming her physically. She told me she needed time to figure things out herself but I wouldnt let her do that and I pushed her so hard she broke up with me. She needed my support and I didnt give it to her. Right now, I am not interested in getting her back. Just as a friend, what do I do now to help her in any way?

 *whoosh* 




 When they are on sale for around $20 I think they are nice. You can get better for full price though.  














 Whoa. 




 [Source](http://www.xvideos.com/video7875911/teen_emily_enagges_in_a_thrilling_sex_with_her_horny_bf_filmed_in_pov) 




 Can you give measurements of both? Hip, thigh, and leg opening? 




 They seem pretty solid to me. I don't know how brutal your winters are but I feel like they would hold up for a few winters of light to moderate snow if you treat them well and don't overwear them (let them dry out between wears).  




 I really like the [these](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0083F3HYA/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8 psc=1) Golden Fox boots. I bought a pair earlier this year and I think they look and feel great for the price.  




 Please post your wallpaper! 




 The canvas ones are pretty good for the price. Don't bother with the leather, it looks and feels like plastic. Can't comment on the suede but I have a pair of their suede canvas boats and I really like them.  




 Sweater looks a tad too big. There shouldn't be any room between the collar and the sweater at the shoulders.  




 Shirt looks very billowy. Consider slim fits.  




 I would say it's too short now but because it's not a full body pic it's hard to tell. 




 They have actual measurements for all of their clothing on the site. Find a shirt that fits you well, measure it, and compare it to Uniqlo's. Actual measurements are the best way to do it! 




 I have recently gotten into thrifting and frequent a thrift shop that gets a lot of J. Crew OCBDs. 

I have heard of the quality difference between J. Crew and J. Crew Factory, with JCF being of substantially lower quality and fit. Obviously if given the option between the two I would go with regular J. Crew; unfortunately to my untrained eye it's hard for me to tell the difference.

I know about the two diamonds under the tag to indicate factory status, however all the J. Crew tags I see either look like [this](http://i742.photobucket.com/albums/xx66/applky/IMG_2930.jpg) or [this](http://i996.photobucket.com/albums/af86/oboy_oboy/IMG_0530.jpg). I have never seen diamonds on the tags of any of the J. Crew OCBDs I have seen. 

How can I tell the difference just from sight?

I can get the OCBDs at $16.50 to $18.50. Is this a good deal? 




 Free return shipping right now! 




 Interesting. Uniqlo's sizing charts peg the slim-fit OCBDs at a full 1 inch smaller in body width than the flannels. I have both on the way in size small so we will see I guess. 

*Edit: Just received my Uniqlo flannels. Two of the three flannels I got fit me absolutely beautifully; the third was overly baggy and fit like a drape. All three were in size small so I guess there are variants between the fit. Once my OCBDs come I will compare the fit to the ones that fit me well.  




 My 511s fit rather tightly around the thighs and perfect around the calves. My 484s fit perfect around the thighs and a little tight around the calves.  




 Porn. 




 It's right at the bottom. In bold **Limited time only:** 




 At first I though you wanted to physically wear chinos over your jeans (like two pants at the same time) and I was really confused.


 




 She is trying so hard to look white, it makes me sad :(

 There is currently also [free return shipping](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/help/returns.html) on all orders right now (near the bottom of the page). Looks like now's the time to buy!  




 Probably trying to say something into his ear so he could hear it over the loudness of the club.  




 Not sure what your definition of sleek is but [here's](http://www.good-stuffs.com/Classic-Rodina-automatic-wrist-watch-OEM-by-Sea-Gull-ST17_p_156.html) a watch that I've been eyeing for a while.  




 I was browsing the J.Crew sale today and I wanted to get a few final sale chinos, but I don't want to mess up the size. After a little researching I came across [this](http://www.styleforum.net/t/181128/slim-fit-chino-j-crew-urban-vs-bb-milano) forum. If you scroll a little down you can see some charts that are supposedly the real measurements for their chinos; however, they don't seem to be right at all. I have a 35" hip and I usually wear size 29 or 30 but according to this chart even the smallest 28 would fall right off me. 

Can anyone who has a pair of J.Crew chinos validate the sizes on this chart? 




 I guess it is my hip size then? But why would jeans advertise waist length instead of hip length? No one wears jeans up to their waist anymore.  




 I remember when I was in high school (only a few years ago) I wore size 32 Levi's and those felt a little tight on me. Now size 30 AEO slim fit jeans slip off my waist without a belt. 

Has anyone else experienced something similar? I'm pretty sure my waist has only grown in size since high school. My true waist size is 35", if that matters at all 




 Jeans + boat shoes: yes or no? Cuff or no cuff? With or without long socks? 




 There are multiple factors that the admissions advisers look at when thinking about admitting a student. GPA and test scores are only a small part of what they consider. 

I will say that you have better everything than me when I was in high school and I got in, so I wouldn't worry at all.  




 Sorry, I'm not really looking for another 270x since my motherboard can't crossfire. Best of luck though! 




 Hi!

I am selling my Asus R9 270x, used about half a year. This card has never been used for mining, and has only been slightly overclocked. Still in great condition, only a little dusty since I don't have access to compressed air. Comes with everything I got it with, including the original box, molex adapters, crossfire cable, etc. I could play Battlefield 4 on Ultra settings with this! Asking $110 shipped OBO. 

I am also considering selling my Gigabyte GTX 770 2GB. I have only used this for about a month, never overclocked. I bought it as a present to myself not realizing that the 900 series would be released so soon, and my return window just passed :( I would like it so I can get some money back for a 970, but I am in no rush to sell it. Make me an offer and I will see if I am willing to part ways with it :) I am looking at somewhere in the realm of $225 shipped.

This is my first swap, but I promise I won't scam you! 

Thanks for looking! 




 What kind of headphone stand is that? Looks kind of like a banana stand.

 I don't understand what you mean by add this code. Put it where exactly? I am at the grouping tab.  




 Be wary using the like for download on Facebook. It will download a whole lot of Chrome extensions and bloatware if you're not careful.  




 My SteelSeries Flux In-Ears went through the wash and I need a new pair of IEMs!

**Budget** - ~$100

**Source** - Primarily phone, I have other full sized headphones for desk use.

**Isolation** - Would be appreciated, though with IEMs it's pretty much a given. 

**Type** - These need to be IEMs. 

**Tonal Balance** - Looking for something more fun? I own a pair of Grado SR325e and I really love how fun they make music sound. 

**Past Headphones** - Too many to list. Serious headphones include Grado SR325e, ATH-M50s, Beyerdynamic DTX 101 iE (though I was very disappointed in the sound of these) and my SteelSeries Flux In-Ears, which were the first IEMs that made me say "wow". 

Looking at Havi B3 Pro-1 and Philips Fidelio S1.

Thanks! 









 Make sure you're clicking directly in the Mouse column and not the Keyboard column. Sounds dumb but I was having trouble getting my Razer Deathadder to button map and this helped.  









 I have a Cooler Master N200 ([Newegg](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811119274)) used for only a year in like new condition, no huge scrapes or scratches or anything. Could use a good cleaning, sorry I don't have a hose or I'd do it myself! Name your price and your location to determine shipping price. Will come with two 120mm fans.  




 You are looking for stuff like Glitchhop. Check out their subreddit! /r/Glitchhop 




 If you go to the About Chrome page and you're running the Android L Preview, it says the android version number is 4.4.99. Interesting... 




 Just wait until you get on campus and go to your first class to purchase any books for that class. Then you will know for sure whether or not you really need the textbook instead of spending a lot of money now on a textbook you won't use at all. You won't be at a disadvantage either since you will probably not use the book at all for the first few weeks anyways, giving you a lot of time to get the right book if you really need it. 

If you MUST get a book now, the textbook that most algebra and calculus classes use is Essential Calculus: Early Transcendentals (Amazon [here](http://www.amazon.com/Essential-Calculus-Transcendentals-James-Stewart/dp/1133112285)). The demand is very high for this book so if you buy it now and find out you don't need it you could sell it to some other freshman very easily. 

Easiest case is just to wait until you really know what book your class uses and if you really need it or not.  




 From what I know, you can use the first and second generation touch and type covers on the Pro 3, it just won't cover the screen all the way. 

If you're waiting a while before purchase see how much money you have when you want to buy, and how much the Surface Pro 2 goes down in price. I think your decision will be much clearer then.  
























 They occasionally go to $50 on sale combined with the usual 30% off gets you $35. If you are very lucky they drop to $30 sale which means less that $20 after discount but they sell out quite quickly at that point. 




 I also wear a slim small in J. Crew. If you wear a Slim Small in J. Crew you are a slim small in Uniqlo. Be warned though, I found Uniqlo's fit to be far inferior to J. Crew's - so much so I returned them. YMMV.  




 J. Crew are definitely one step higher than Uniqlo's. Fit is more on par and quality is definitely higher. Just feels like a more quality piece to me. 

I usually grab my J. Crew's at around $30, so they are well worth the $10 difference to me. Whether they are $30 better is up to you.  




 Pretty sure these items at TJ Maxx and Marshall's are lower quality lines produced specifically for these stores. There are hundreds of these socks in the ones in my city. 

I think the general rule of thumb is if there's a only a few items in a single size it is a mainline, normal quality item (American Eagle and some Levi's washes come to mind); if you see a ton of an item in multiple sizes (pretty much everything else), it's a low quality item. Compare this to [mainline](http://www.divisadero.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ww-socks.jpg) [packaging](http://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/d/l225/m/mBPjOCzQo5_zDWe8TIl9H2A.jpg) and you can see a big difference.  




 Do a quick search for skin tone charts. It's true that there are certain colors that look best with certain skin tones, and skin tones usually correspond to race. 

I think MFA doesn't talk about this much because the colors that are recommended here (light blue, light pink, charcoal, navy blue) are colors that work pretty well on everyone. And I do think that how you wear the colors matters more than how the colors look on you. 




 Texas

Y'all 

Checks out.  




 I'll take the Armani Code! 




 I think it looks good. I would not wear it with a crew neck undershirt though. 




 I think your definition of "punchable" is based on facial features alone. And that's totally okay. 

Here's my take. I think punchability has less to do with the facial features and overall attractiveness and more to do with the attitude that is carried by the person, and therefore the face. [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/punchablefaces/comments/2e8b94/this_fucking_twat/) [are](http://www.reddit.com/r/punchablefaces/comments/2kdn6z/i_cant_believe_this_cunt_isnt_the_top_post/) [some](http://www.reddit.com/r/punchablefaces/comments/2atzgu/vine_star_and_little_brat_nash_grier/) [examples] (http://www.reddit.com/r/punchablefaces/comments/2hlmv3/the_doucheness_is_overwhelming/) of people that I think most people would consider attractive; however, the facial expression and attitude they carry make them extremely punchable. The phrase that is thrown around for this kind of effect is "douchey." If the pictures were of them smiling nicely (or just without the smug looks on their faces) they might be less punchable. For instance, I don't think people think [George Clooney](http://www.phootoscelebrities.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/George-Clooney-smile.jpg) has a punchable face even though he is attractive and many people are jealous of his aesthetics. It's because he carries himself with a certain poise that makes him seem likable and kind - definitely not punchable.

I think people with unfortunate facial features sometimes makes them look like they act like a douche or have a smug attitude even though they really don't. The male you linked above is one of those faces for me, as is [this](http://i.imgur.com/YJYSstG.jpg) face. Just something about the nose and the hair makes me want to punch this kid in the face. He's not making any particular facial expression, or acting a certain way, but still, the urge is there. Most people's faces aren't the most attractive or desirable, but I don't go around all day thinking that everyone's face I see is punchable just because their nose is a little big or their eyes a little small. I know plenty of less attractive people that I would never dream of wanting to punch in the face because they are nice and pleasant to be around and look nice and pleasant too. Those girls fall into this category for me - they look pleasant to be around, not punchable. 

I'm sorry you're being downvoted for stating your opinion, OP. 
 




 We circlejerkin' but their supima cotton shirts are amazing. Got a few at $7.90 over black friday.  




 If you're worried about how they hurt your ears, just keep wearing them for a few days. Mine hurt like a bitch the first 10 hours or so but now I can wear them all day with no discomfort. 

Another alternative would be to turn them into around ears with a pair of G cushions. I have heard they are substantially more comfortable.  




 Yes. I wear 30x32 in 511s and 30x30 in 484s.  




 They will definitely stretch. If they are a tad too tight brand new they are perfect.  




 Christ I just bought these at $1.90 a pair earlier today. I mean it's less than a dollar difference... but... *frugality...* 




 I wear size 9 in Sperrys and 9.5 in athletic shoes and 8.5s are great in CDBs.  




 American Eagle jeans tend to run very large. If AE fits a little large on you I would definitely go for the 31/30, but if they fit a little tight or just right I would stay with the sizing.  




 You turn it on it's side... 




 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalAf3yMiio 




 This list misses the two top recommended colognes by this poster: Acqua Di Gio and Armani Code. I have tried both and I really enjoy them. 

Most people think they are really played out, and I agree. I have definitely smelled people using Acqua Di Gio before I even knew what it was. If you go to a more fashionable college that has a lot of bros using it I would steer clear but I go to a nerd school where no one uses cologne so I thought it was a safe bet. 

[Original comment here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/2iiwxb/what_cologne_should_i_buy/cl2ms6f) 




 It sounds like Macy's won't have much in terms of clothing if you are already shopping at Brooks Brothers and Barbour. I would suggest using it to buy some nice cologne or some appliances/house items. Or you could always sell it for cash at a discount.  




 Just bought a nice bottle of the stuff and was wondering how you all personally apply it.  




 Look up your skin tone online. Generally there are four main skin tones that correspond with the seasons (spring, summer, fall, winter), and a warm/deep and cool variation of each (occasionally a neutral). A quick Google search for determining your skin tone will get you on the right track. 

If you are Asian, I can almost guarantee that you are some variation of Winter. Whether you are warm, cool, or neutral is up to you to determine. 

Each type of skin tone will have a color palate that looks best. Again, a quick Google search of your skin tone + color palate will give you a good indication of which colors will work well for you.  




 I think they are most definitely a step higher.  




 Yes but it's Levi's. Just incredibly inconsistent sizing. 




 Wow they really do look like chinos. Just bought a pair! Thanks! 




 Same here bro. Same here.  




 Eh they're no miracle shirts but they definitely help imo.  




 It looks like you might be able to use a seam ripper to remove them. 




 I'd try something underneath. A Uniqlo heattech undershirt works great for the cold. 




 This infograph is a two roll cuff, which is very difficult to do, as the fabric that is normally around your forearm is now around your bicep. Try doing it so there's only one roll (don't pull the cuff so high in step two and then skip step three and go to step four). The roll should now be around your elbow/upper forearm, and should be much easier to do.

When I roll up my sleeves I tend to shift the entire shirt over to make the sleeve I'm rolling up longer. Then when I'm finished rolling I recenter my shirt. This way my forearms don't get in the way. Sorry if that doesn't make sense. 

Either way don't sweat it. As long as you roll up your sleeves neatly it will look good any way you do it. 




 I just recently got a pair of the heattech gloves and I love them. They are as thin as a pair of those crappy 100% acrylic gloves but they are much warmer. The plus side of them being thin is that you maintain nearly 100% dexterity for things such as fiddling with keys or checking your phone (they are touchscreen compatible). I no longer have to take off my gloves to change the song on my phone! 

If you are out in the cold for a very long time you might want something a little more substantial, but these are so thin that they would probably fit underneath a bigger glove. Definitely worth it. 




 I'll take the heathered cotton OCBD! 




 I have an Asus R9 270X I am willing to sell for $90 shipped. Negotiable. 




 I think it looks great provided the tops aren't too vibrant. Stick to soft faded and pastel colors since the white will already be very bright and vibrant. 

Off-color white shorts might be the more versatile option if you want to wear both vibrant and faded tops. 




 They are very thin but fit incredibly well and are the softest shirt I have ever worn. Great as a layering piece. 

Note that the cut varies a lot so if you aren't satisfied with the fit try another one.  




 "Unique Clothing" 




 I got my ultra light down parka today and it absolutely blew me away with how thin, light and yet warm it was. I wore it out with only a heattech undershirt and an OCBD in sub-freezing temps today and I was very comfortably warm. Definitely worth it.  




 Holy hell that is so skinny.  




 That's kind of the appeal of pullover hoodies, I'm afraid. I like the way it bunches up because it gives me a more muscular look (I'm pretty skinny). Maybe consider zip-up hoodies? I find they tend to fit straighter.  




 American Eagle is slowly moving towards simple and minimally branded items. While some of their items still have flashy logos, you can find some really nice two tones or color-blocked sweaters and shirts. 

Also, most of the brands you find recommended on here (J. Crew, H M, Uniqlo) have no branding whatsoever.  




 It's for a college class. 




 Hi everyone!

I have an assignment to interview an entrepreneur for my Intro to Entrepreneurship class. Problem is, I don't know any entrepreneurs personally, so I decided to come here for help! Below is a list of questions that form the guideline for the essay I need to write (copy and pasted directly from my assignment guidelines). 

	Idea selection  individual or team 

	How did the market and customer research effect the decision to launch?

	Describe the process of making the go/no go decision  what other alternatives were under consideration?

	How accurate was the market research?  What changes were required after launch to reorient the business or venture?

	Describe the company culture.  How did the founder set the mold for the enduring culture?  What, if anything, endangered it over time?

	How do they balance time between work, family, and personal pursuits?

	Do they remain as passionate about the product or service as when the company launched?

	Learn about the early business plans.  How useful were they in making decisions?

	Being a CEO/founder is a lonely position.  What steps have they taken to surround themselves with trusted advisors, board members, family, etc.?

	How have they financed the venture?  What lessons can they convey about financing options?

	How actively do they think about selling or exiting the venture?  Why?

Any help would be greatly appreciated! Even just a short summary of your startup or venture would be awesome. 

P.S. I won't be copying down your responses word for word, I need to write an essay based or your responses, so don't worry about that. I have also looked around the IAmAs on the sidebar but the question asked there aren't really focused enough and don't really form enough of a cohesive story for what the professor wants for this assignment. 
 




 I think it makes a lot of sense to get a suit of your own right now. There are plenty of situations (applying for an internship, pledging for a frat, dates) that come up frequently enough that it is nice and convenient to have one on hand. 

That being said, I think spending a lot of money on one right now is a waste. It's not going to get a whole lot of use, even in the situations listed above, and your body will most likely still change in college (freshman 15 woooo!). Blowing a lot of money on a suit that will be worn only a handful of times before it doesn't fit anymore sucks. 

My suggestion is to buy one reasonably priced and reasonable quality suit that is extremely versatile. As said previously, there won't be a situation where navy is acceptable but charcoal isn't, and vice versa. The JCP one looks like a great choice, especially if you are patient and wait for a sale. 

I would go with a charcoal suit, but that's just, like, my opinion man. 

 




 As someone who also has broad shoulders and thin everything else, I would have some caution with Uniqlo's OCBDs. I found that even their slim fits were too billowy at the waist when I fit the shoulders right. Great quality, but their cut left a lot to be desired. 

I have found that J. Crew OCBDs fit me absolutely perfectly everywhere. If you can afford them, I would definitely consider them if you find that Uniqlo's don't fit you quite right.  




 I have the same issue, and I have found that American Eagle shirts are great. Very comfortable around the shoulders and sit perfectly at the waist. Their v-necks are my go-to shirts. 

For dress shirts, you pretty much have to tailor.  




 [Luxire Slim Peacoat - S - $150](http://www.grailed.com/listings/29965-luxire-slim-grey-peacoat-msrp-450) 




 Don't know what your definition of "not too expensive" is but I got [this](https://www.jcrew.com/mens_category/outerwear/wool/PRD~49025/49025.jsp?Nbrd=J Nloc=en_US Nrpp=48 Npge=1 Ntrm=49025 isSaleItem=false color_name=CHARCOAL isFromSearch=true isNewSearch=true hash=row0) J. Crew University Jacket and I love it.  
























 Can you link it for me? I can't seem to find it. 




 It sounds like chaos because the timing is off and the brain can't find a "groove" to settle into. Take a look at what /u/Poobslag commented above. The chord changes are jarring and seem out of time with the song.  




 Tapered is your answer. No one's calves are bigger than their thighs. 




 Standard tapered have significant'y more thigh room than slims. I went with a standard tapered because I normally can't wear slim pants (511 is a sausage-thigh fit) and I normally wear normal tapers but I definitely could have gone with a slim tapered. Think of slim as the standard, skinny as the slim, and standard as the "plus".

I will say the standard still has a nice taper to them. They won't look like dad pants.  




 Some leather conditioner might help.  




 [Navali bags](http://www.navali.com/bags/boatswain-messenger-bag.html?product=anchor639) are pretty nice. And they're on sale right now! 




 You should wear light, pastel colors. 

If you want to really go in depth, check out [this](http://www.wikihow.com/Choose-Colors-That-Flatter-Skin-Tone) guide to determining your skin tone. Once you've found it, search your skin tone + color chart to find a palate of colors that work well with your specific skin tone. 

Note that these aren't set rules! If you find a color that doesn't match your skin tone but you think still looks good on you, rock it! And what color your clothes are relative to you matters very little. What's much more important is your clothes' color relative to each other. 

As for what clothes you should wear, check out the side bar's Getting Started Guide and hang around on this sub. 

Good luck! 




 I know charcoal colored gets thrown around here a lot but I already have one of those (J. Crew University coat, which I love) and I'm looking to expand my coat selection during the coming end-of-season sales. I am looking for a light, heather gray wool coat.

I love the design and color of [this Zara](http://www.zara.com/us/en/sale/man/coats-and-trench-coats/coats/double-faced-coat-c541817p2161054.html) coat but I have heard bad things about Zara and the quality at this price point. I would rather have something that will last me a while. Is there anything with a similar design? Or should I just go for this one?

I also like the [Schott Car Coat in Heather Gray](https://www.schottnyc.com/products/wool-car-coat.htm) but my size is already sold out. 

The [J. Crew Skiff Jacket](https://www.jcrew.com/AST/Navigation/Sale/AllProducts/PRD~A9716/A9716.jsp?Nbrd=J Nloc=en_US Nrpp=48 Npge=1 Ntrm=skiff isSaleItem=true color_name=CHARCOAL isFromSearch=true isNewSearch=true hash=row0) is also nice but doesn't come in the light gray color I want.

Do you know of any coats that fit my description?  




 It's called flaring, and there isn't too much you can do about it. I'd return it if you still can. Ironing may also help.  




 All this is sound advice, but if he is unmotivated to do any of this with you, there is very little you can do to persuade him otherwise. Some people just don't care about clothing or fashion at all, and no amount of guidance or conversation will be able to change that. If you try all of this and he STILL doesn't want to do it, please don't try to force it or make ultimatums or anything like that, for the sake of your relationship. Just accept that he really doesn't care and drop the issue. 

I really hope everything works out! Good luck! 




 Don't worry about having the "normal" amount of pants. Even if you had 500 pairs, if you had a use for and are happy with owning all of them, it's okay.  




 I used to do the same thing as you when I was first starting out and buying my basic items. Now that I have a good enough wardrobe my shopping experience is a little different. There are a few items that I am looking at purchasing/upgrading to add to my wardrobe (parka, dress shoes) that I am slowly researching and taking my time on purchasing. When I go to stores I take a look at these items but also "impulse buy" anything that I like that is on sale (ie. might not be there when I come back) at stores that have good return policies. I then sit on it for a while and really consider whether I will really use an item or not. Most often I end up returning the item. If what I like is not on sale I'll add it to my list of things to research more. This gives me the "shopping fix" without wasting any money.

I view shopping as more of a journey than a destination spot. I have more than enough basics that I don't have to make trips to buy specific things anymore - instead, I shop to see new clothes that maybe aren't exactly in line with my current style or something I wouldn't necessarily think of wearing. Maybe I will be inspired to try something new. 

A total of zero of my friends care about dressing well, and they view shopping as a chore and only go when they absolutely need something, and try to be in and out as fast as possible. They make fun of me for going every week and coming back with nothing. But I don't care. To me it's an experience that helps me develop my personal style. 

Plus going by myself gets me away from my asshole friends. 

TL;DR: what you're doing is fine and better than what most people do.  




 I think the most important thing about a fragrance is whether you like it or not. If you don't like it, you won't be confident when you wear it, and confidence is everything.  




 I would save up an extra $50 or so and get a pair of Meermins.  




 Uniqlo heattech is deep enough that two buttons undone won't show. I have yet to try to airisms.  




 Stretch might not be the right word to use... A wool coat will "soften" up over time, conform to your body shape and become much more comfortable to wear after a little while. 

I definitely think there is such a thing as "breaking in" a wool coat. If the fit is fine, just give it a little time to relax and form to you.  




 if 




 Honestly I think Ross's cologne prices aren't anything spectacular. You can buy the same things on Amazon for about the same/even less. 

Watch the clearance section for reasonable deals. I picked up some Calvin Klein Euphoria that I really like.  




 Perry Ellis 360 Red is the one that smells like Aqua di Gio. Personally I think Perry Ellis 360 smells absolutely disgusting. It made me so nauseous I had to wash it off. 




 It doesn't look like she's eaten anything before.  




 So soaking in vinegar does nothing? Is there anything else I can do?  




 If I don't want my new raws to get super siq faydes what should I do? I've heard a cold water, salt, and vinegar soak helps lock in more dye. I've heard woolite dark helps. 




 What size should I get if I wear 8.5s-9s? 




 I have the same problem and Uniqlo's cut was really bad for me. I have found J. Crew's slim shirts to fit very well off the rack. 




 If I don't want my new raws to get super siq faydes, what should I do? I've heard a cold water, salt, and vinegar soak helps lock in more dye. 




 As much as I hate to circle-jerk, Uniqlo's stuff fits your body type very well. Other brands that I find fit well are J. Crew and American Eagle. 

Source: am thin, tall Asian. 




 Just get both and try them on, they have free returns.  




 I just called my store and they told me they weren't doing the extra 50% off winter items and denim :( Oh well, it's still a great price! 




 Unfortunately my local store doesn't carry Unbranded :( Do you think they would still take the 50% off? 









 Looks too small and tight. It looks like an undershirt right now. 

Tanks should be a little loose and billowy. You're supposed to be letting the air flow through to keep you cool. [This](http://www.randysreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/bro-tank.jpg) is how I think they should fit to look okay. Notice that the chest is not skin tight, as it is right now.  




 What is normally included in these grab bags?  




 I am looking to be an investment manager, the interview will be at Morgan Stanley. Still think it will be okay? 




 Would a dark brown perforated cap toe shoe be too casual for an interview? Should I do a non-perforated cap toe instead? 




 And free! 




 Uniq-

Oh, you said boxers, not boxer briefs. 

But still, most likely Uniqlo. 




 Also, these "mature" clothes mentioned above will look "young/fresh" if they fit well and are cut in a modern style. That way you can still look grown-up while still keeping a fresh look.

This is the game I play constantly in college.  




 I got sent another one of these codes today and noticed that it was the same one I received yesterday. I tried it and the code worked! I would try using your codes again and seeing if they reset overnight.  




 J. Crew's 770 fit is very similar. 




 Get a suede brush (or use a firm toothbrush) and brush the shoes to restore the nap. Be sure to brush in one direction, like you're brushing a pet.  




 Nice, picked up a pair of used Chippewa's for $58.18. Got lucky! 




 Warby Parker

edit: oh crap you said not expensive... yeah I have no clue. Sorry :( 




 Your hair is the perfect type to do something like that in the picture. There is about no way to get your hair to look like that without using product, at least at first, so don't worry about how your hair grows at the roots. You will be able to style it like that. 

In regards to clothes, just read the sidebar and hang around on this sub. Go thrifting and experiment with clothing. Remember, fit is king. Slowly but surely your style will develop and you will start looking the way you want to.  




 J. Crew has a similar fit with a longer body length.  




 Not a big fan of J. Crew Factory personally. I'd say Uniqlo has the edge quality-wise, but J. Crew's fits just work better for me.  




 I just called and they didn't let me :(  




 I'd check out Warby Parker, they have plenty of glasses that would match pretty well.  
























 I understand the appeal of siq faydez but they are not for me. Very slight wallet, whiskers, and honeycombs are fine but when the thighs and knees start going I don't like it anymore.  




 Online stock is actually reflects all stock including items at retail locations now. However, people are always returning stuff (I actually have one of these in a small that I need to return, so look out for that!).  




 Yeah, the 770 is their tapered cut, in between the 1040 slim straight and the 484. It is my absolute favorite cut for pants.  




 I believe it is a J. Crew Baird McNutt Irish linen shirt. 

But everyone else is on par. Most brands will be short enough, or you can get them hemmed by a tailor.  




 Square looks much better but it might not be the shape. All the ones from your home try-on are too narrow for your face. Your rectangle ones right now are the right width. Try more pairs that are wider (Warby's website has a filter).  




 You're gonna be waiting a while for the Oneplus Two. Oneplus CEO says he will release it in either quarter two or quarter three of 2015.  




 Everyone else's advise is solid. You really need to find a scent that *you* like, and works well with your natural scent. That means going to a store and trying a few. There are multitudes of guides on reddit (one in our very own sidebar!) to get you started on some popular, quality colognes. 

Just a note: you will be damn hard pressed to find a fragrance that lasts 10-12 hours. A good longevity for a summer fragrance is about 4-5 hours, winter fragrance around 7-8. 10-12 is basically unheard of. 

Another note: don't skimp on fragrance. Cheap fragrances will smell cheap and you'd honestly be better off not wear anything. A bottle lasts a long time (more than a year) so spend a little more on a good one.  




 It definitely doesn't need to be all that close. The usual recommendation is the same shade or a few darker. The goal is to have it look like a shadow. It is normally ill-advised to match the socks to the shoe, especially black-black, since it makes your shoe look like a boot. With a suit, however, I think it's fine. A few shades down from charcoal is black, after all. 

Personally I like to have my socks have a little flair to them, so they are interesting. I have stripes, dots, fair isle, and speckled socks that complement the rest of what I'm wearing. This is only for casual outfits though, definitely would not do this with a suit. 

You should only wear white socks while working out.  




 The measurement listed is the relaxed or unstretched measurement. I got my usual size and it was fine.  




 You can get them for around $20-30 regularly on sale. [Example.](https://www.jcrew.com/mens_category/shirts/oxford/PRD~93060/93060.jsp?N=21+16+11997+12017+12059+12136+12138+12140+12318 Nbrd=J Nloc=en_US Nrpp=48 Npge=1 Nsrt=1 isSaleItem=true color_name=FAIRMONT%20BLUE isFromSale=true isNewSearch=true hash=row9) $30 on sale right now.  




 Unbutton the bottom button of your blazer, either unbutton the top button on the shirt or button it all the way up (your second button is undone, I don't know if this was a mistake or intentional). The sleeves are also about an inch too long.  




 Those aren't suit pants, so I wouldn't try to exactly match a jacket to them. A charcoal blazer might work, but know that it will never be on par with a suit.

*Edit: on second thought, they might actually be suit pants. Still, I would not try to match a suit jacket with it, since that always doesn't work. Try to find a complimenting blazer. 




 Generally too many patterns is not pleasing to the eye. To be completely conservative I'd say only one should have a pattern, though that is flexible if you know what you are doing. 

No, the two pieces do not need to have a bit of the same color in each. I'd even go so far to say that you run the risk of looking matchy-matchy if you do that. At the very least they need to be complementary colors. 

Side note: argyle pattern is seen as very unfashionable and has been for quite some time. 




 I'd just go into a local Nike or Nike outlet store and have a look at the clearance racks. They usually have some pretty fly shoes there for relatively cheap. 




 You could try a hot wash and dry but in all honesty it probably won't shrink much if at all, and you run the risk of messing up the construction of the jacket (zippers get all wrinkly, padding gets loose and bunches up) and the material might not feel the best afterwards. I would just wear it as is. 




 You're probably gonna want something that's more natural looking, such as rope or leather. Maybe some wooden beads or something like that? 

Metal might work as long as it's not super shiny. Raw cuts or slightly tarnished metals might look cool. Larger rather than smaller links. 

Sorry I don't have any examples. I'm not a huge fan of necklaces myself.  




 Nothing wrong with that. What would be the alternative? Buying a piece, wearing it once, and then selling it or throwing it away? That's just not practical or smart.

I think your clothing is an extension of your own personality, and your personality doesn't tend to change too much. People will see your clothes and think it's "you," not think you're wearing a uniform that someone else picked out for you.  




  Remember that the only person you're trying to dress better than is your old self - not everyone around you.

Damn son, that is so wise. This would be inside an MFA fortune cookie. 




 The Uniqlo ones are even shorter.  




 Yes, they taper much harder, with a much smaller leg opening. The thighs are a little looser though. I had to size down one for my 508s (though with Levi's inconsistent sizing that probably doesn't mean anything). 




 Try 508s (I think thnk they just recently got renamed to 522s?). Just by looking at your pictures, I think the 510s will be too tight in the thighs. The 508s/522s will preserves your thigh space while giving you the taper you desire.  




 Get a [shoe rack](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/images/products/portis-shoe-rack-black__0246839_PE385765_S4.JPG). 




 This is a great place for you to be! Just hang around for a while and slowly you will get the hang of it. 

Also check out /r/TeenMFA for more stuff geared towards your age group. 

Good luck! 




 I am assuming you are not buttoning up the button down shirt, like [this?](http://images.shopmadeinchina.com/9ABAACE1CDF4E37EE040007F01006991/345/6605345/VANCL-Soft-Peached-Cotton-Casual-Shirt-Lake-Blue_6605345.bak.jpg) Personally I would not tuck anything in. 

And no problem! I remember how confused I was when I first started. 

Since it seems like you are actually receptive to advice, this sort of question (and the one you had for the thread) would be right at home in the Simple Questions Thread, which is posted every day.  




 You're very welcome! Also check out MFA's [beginner's shirt guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/vor0m/beginner_shirt_guide/) for an even more depth explanation, and the sidebar in general for most of your fashion questions. Good luck! 




 There are different "formality levels" to shirt, which depend on the construction of the shirt, the fabric, and the pattern. 

The construction of the shirt is arguably the most important. Anything with a [stiff,](http://propercloth.com/images/collars_overview/pres_spread/tie_thumb.jpg) [fused](http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http%3A%2F%2F3.bp.blogspot.com%2F-xkEpgwLqhjU%2FTqu_KvaW31I%2FAAAAAAAAEYo%2Ft-A4cx9Jzjw%2Fs640%2Fdress-shirt-collar.jpg imgrefurl=http%3A%2F%2Fa-man-fashion.blogspot.com%2F2011%2F11%2Fmen-fashion-dress-shirts-back-to-basic.html h=360 w=480 tbnid=lSCjEwO6L-cbbM%3A zoom=1 docid=jIGQR7JXmtE1QM ei=1P2pVOiNDsqfyAS14YGoAw tbm=isch ved=0CCwQMygOMA4 iact=rc uact=3 dur=1549 page=1 start=0 ndsp=43) collar is going to be more formal. A [soft,](http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.tumblr.com%2F5a1416dfa8808b7b436417a3cbc7c0dc%2Ftumblr_inline_ml2vwcSGbi1qz4rgp.jpg imgrefurl=http%3A%2F%2Fputthison.com%2Fpost%2F47706678968%2Fthe-ocbd-shirt-series-part-ii-the-golden-era h=375 w=500 tbnid=YBIUFOA56l9_YM%3A zoom=1 docid=zaKMGiyUDydjCM ei=LP6pVPXEAYz2yQSA2oGYBQ tbm=isch ved=0CFcQMygwMDA iact=rc uact=3 dur=1232 page=2 start=45 ndsp=52) [button-down](http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fzady-web-production2.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fee%2Ffb32f0735211e4ab58317550235f5e%2F31_027.jpg imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fzady.com%2Fproducts%2Fapolis-indigo-flannel-button-down h=1056 w=1056 tbnid=6qG0549yxQUVMM%3A zoom=1 docid=w4baNOOnx1M8RM ei=k_6pVPSJPNWqyASL-YKYAw tbm=isch ved=0CD0QMyg1MDU4ZA iact=rc uact=3 dur=2074 page=4 start=151 ndsp=62) collar is going to be much more casual. It's called a button-down because the collar buttons down onto the shirt. All shirts that have buttons on the front are called button-ups. A button-down shirt is also a button up, but a button up shirt is not necessarily a button-down!  

Fabric is the next important. There are many different types of fabrics for a shirt; [here's](http://www.realmenrealstyle.com/dress-shirt-fabrics/) a really in-depth overview on the most common ones. Generally, thinner, finer, "shinier" fabrics are more formal (broadcloth), and thicker, rough-textured fabrics (oxford cloth, twill, flannel) are more casual.  

You say you want a solid shirt, so I'm going to leave patterns out. Generally, though, solid colors and more formal and any sort of pattern is more casual. 

The most common casual collared shirt recommended here is the oxford-cloth button down, or OCBD. 




 Remember, dressing well does not mean dressing up. It means maximizing your outfit in your current situation (wearing well fitting t-shirts and sweaters, not swapping them for dress shirts and suits).  




 The Durands and Prestons look the best. The reason why is because the other ones are not wide enough for your face. Try out wider glasses; Warby Parker has a filter on the website from them.  




 You are legally within your right to refuse a return for any reason. Whether you want to risk potentially pissing off a customer and getting a bad rep is up to you. 

[Here's](http://www.retailers.com/FAQRetrieve.aspx?ID=51537) an article I found with a quick search. I have no idea if it is reputable or not.  




 Put a little water into the rice before you microwave it (maybe two tablespoons per cup), microwave it for longer than you think, then fluff and let stand for a minute. It will be as good as new! 

*Note: only works on reasonably recently cooked rice. Not five day old crap.  




 It's also occasionally called Donegal. [Here's](https://www.jcrew.com/mens_category/WallaceBarnes/PRD~30690/30690.jsp?Nbrd=J Nloc=en_US Nrpp=48 Npge=1 Ntrm=donegal isSaleItem=false color_name=CHALKBOARD%20DONEGAL isFromSearch=true isNewSearch=true hash=row0) one from J. Crew, though it has shoulder patches. 

*Edit: They also sell [normal](https://www.jcrew.com/mens_category/sweaters/LAMBSWOOL/PRDOVR~B2153/B2153.jsp), non-collab ones earlier in the season for cheaper, but they are all sold out now.  




 That is the most perfect explanation for why fake glasses are douchey. I've always been put off by them but wasn't quite sure why, and now I know. I will be using this from now on. Thank you! 




 The term you're looking for is "dress shirt." A dark dress shirt is even less versatile than a dark OCBD. That dress shirt has been $12.90 at Uniqlo for the past few months and there's a good reason why they aren't selling. Don't buy it.  




 He means a dress shirt.  




 Another suit that is often recommended at that price point is the [J. Crew Factory Thompson Suit](https://factory.jcrew.com/mens-clothing/suiting/PRDOVR~47226/47226.jsp?color_name=charcoal). 




 Look into blocking. You can form your sweater to fit how you like.  




 Steve Maddens are generally looked down upon as having poor construction. Check out this [boot buying guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/goodyearwelt/comments/2r0fld/a_beginners_boot_buying_guide/) to get on the right track.  




 Yes, the one that is fuzzy is Heather Gray. The other two that are not fuzzy are a sort of pale red and purple (I think Old Red and Pale Violet?).  




 Just buy it and try it. Free returns.  




 Take a look at the Getting Started guide in the sidebar.  




 You're right but you used the wrong word. The correct term is "rise", not inseam. Inseam is the length of the pants leg, rise is the length of the top block.  




 Wear your pants up higher in your waist. If you don't them to sit so high try low rise pants. You want to minimize the amount of extra space between your balls and the bottom of the pants crotch. Too tight jeans will also make them blow out faster.  




 Nope, I actually kinda like it. I think it feels nice and soft like a flannel. I have yet to see whether any of my other ones will get fuzzy like this  since I haven't washed any of them yet.  

Mind you I probably would have exchanged it if I had purchased it new. But no it has not stopped me from wearing it.


 




 The one I got used on grailed is like that but all the ones I've bought brand new have been like regular oxfords. I think it might be because it was machine dried, but I have no clue.  




 You can't :( 




 The first ones hands down.  




 If your feet hurt at any time while wearing a shoe, especially after 5 weeks which is more than enough time for a good break-in, something is wrong. Talk to someone about it.
