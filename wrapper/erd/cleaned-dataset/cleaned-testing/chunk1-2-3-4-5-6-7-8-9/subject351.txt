 Newer cars help cars stay in the line and help drivers stop if needed. This will help drunk drivers make it home safer and keep them from being pulled over. Good or bad? 




 Cops cannot do anything with anonymous tips anymore 
























 I'm thinking about going down there. I know a house burnt down before this house was built.  




 My girlfriend, her mother, and I live in a two story house with her 5 year old son. The house is in an area that is prone to flooding so the house was built raised off the ground about 6 feet. It's a nice house, but it came with an unexpected visitor.

I noticed early on that something was going on in the house, that everyone else seemed obblivous too. When walking by the stairs on the first floor I can see a black shadow person standing at the top of the stairs, sometimes even walking by up there. Also when on the first floor we can hear footsteps walking around up stairs, everyone jsut blamed it on a creaky house. It likes to peak down from the space that the stairs meet the ceiling. I tried telling everyone about him, but I'm just crazy right? My girlfriend asked me once to check her tires and see if they needed any air in them. So of course i went straight to teh car and checked the tired and noticed a few of them needed some air in them. I walked into the garage and the air compressor was plugged in an outlet and was running. We happen to all be outside at the time doing yard work.

I noticed however that I wasn't the only one in the house that noticed our frequent visitor. My girlfriends son could see him also. He would come running into the our room every so often crying that a man in his room woke him up and scared him. I ran downstairs to his room to see if there was anyone in the room but it was just an empty dark room. when i walked back to our room I saw a shadow walk by the stairs on the first level. I quickly ran down there to stop the intruder but there was noone down there but me. All of the doors were locked so there was no way someone could have entered the house. My girlfriend chalked it up to bad dreams, but I knew what was really going on. Evetually it became like a ritual of her son running into the room crying.

This weekend I noticed her son was outside talking to himself. Thinking how its cute to listen to a child talk I listened to the conversation.  He was talking to a locked entry way to underneather the house. http://imgur.com/cPVDPIA "Stop waking me up I don't like you in my room. Please stay down there and don't wake me up." I asked him what he was talking about and said he was telling the man that lived under our house to stop coming into our house because he's very scary. It sent a chill down my spine becuase I knew I wasn't crazy then. Last night I had her son sleep with us in our room, partly so he could get some sleep and partly because I didn't want him in that room by himself.

As he was sleeping he started talking in his sleep. He quietly mumbled that the man was in our room. I sat up quickly and saw the black shadow man standing in our corner. The man vanished but I could hear him walking towards the door. I saw the door slowly creak shut. I ran towards the door and flew it open, jsut as i heard the door downstairs open. As I go down the stairs i saw our back door wide open. As I checked outside the locked entryway was also open and the lock was nowhere to be seen. I closed the entryway to underneath the house, closed the back door and crawled back into bed. My Heart was pumping uncontrollably and as soon as i calmed down and was about to fall asleep her son whispered to us again. "The man said he is coming back tomorrow night to see us.


edit: added picture of opening underneath house 





























 Possibly. I'll try and look it up. That'll be in part two and also when I'm done there too. Check for it in the next couple of days 
























 I'm tempted too. If I can't fix it I'm selling it 




 Here's Part 1 incase you missed it.

I had another experience and I believe I now know the cause of what has been happening at our house. Originally we thought that the house that had burned down before ours may have claimed an unlucky soul, but after further research I discovered that everyone that had been living at that house had all survived. I wasn't sure how i felt about discovering this. I wasn't sure if I was glad that no one was injured or not. What happened was where the house used to be was in between my neighbors house and ours. Once it burnt down the land was split between two properties. How could the house be haunted if no one was injured? Then what could have been causing everything that has been happening at the house. Was the original fire an accident?

Last night we were all tucked into bed ready for a good night sleep. I had brought my girlfriends sons bed into the room with us; to make sure he would be able to sleep after the other night. I was fast asleep as well as my girlfriend too when we heard her son calling for me. I sat up to see if everything was all right and he was laying in bed with his eyes wide open. He said in a very calm yet nervous tone, "My bed slid towards the closet, can you please close the door?". The bed was no longer parallel to the closet, but the front of the bed(where his head lays) was pointed towards the open closet door open. Thinking fast I told him to just come to bed with us because I had to move his bed to get something. (This was a lie but there was no point into sending him into a panic state) Why was the closet door open? My girlfriend always closed the door before she went to bed because she couldn't sleep with it open. I shut the door and jumped back into bed, just hoping to sleep through the night.

This is when things began to really go south. When I woke up I noticed I couldn't open my eyes or move my body what so ever. I thought oh just sleep paralysis, my body will wake up eventually. It didn't. All of the sudden I heard a weird bird outside shriek and my chest began to tighten up. It felt as if a 500 pound person was standing on my chest. I then began to panic. I started sweating bullets from the heat and short breaths, and my arm that had been laying across my neck began to push down on my neck. I was choking and I couldn't scream and couldn't defend myself. I was helpless as I was slowly suffocating. All I could do was say a prayer in my head. As soon as I finished everything went back to normal. I was awake and so was my body. I couldn't sleep the rest of the night. I just sat awake and made sure my girlfriend and her son were all right.

My grandpa had told me stories of demons that sit on the chest of sleeping victims. They are incubus and the succubus. These demons are known for sitting on the chests of men and women asleep. What these demons are known for is that it can take either a female or male shape and will sit on the sleepers chest and could even sleep with that human. If a female is slept with this demon they could be impregnated by that demon. If a male sleeps with that demon the demon could take over the males body. I wasn't touched that way by the demons nor will i allow them too. Also they will try and kill infants. They are easily researched and widely believed. I fell like that is what has been happening at this house. And the "Man that lives underneath our house" really does live underneath our house. Just much farther down than originally believed. I'm very scared for my girlfriend and her son and myself. Good thing my Grandpa has dealt with demons and spirits so I am going to fight this evil spirit. He used to be a white witch in Ireland before making his way to the states. He is very knowledgeable about demons and fighting demons. Much of the same as a priest, just not a religious figure. I will post a part three telling you guys what I am going to do about the demon that is ruining our lives. Also I will explain other ways to protect yourself from evil. Wish us luck.

 I want to create a website and I would like to hire other web developers and designers to help make this website. Also the money will allow me to let local business's spend less money on the website for advertising.
