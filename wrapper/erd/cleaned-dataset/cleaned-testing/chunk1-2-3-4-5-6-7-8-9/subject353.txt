 You seriously dont see the eyes? They have pupils and everything. The movie I was watching was the expendables 3. At the 59 min mark approx. It started skipping then froze at this spot. At first i figured it was just a flaw in the disc but thats when i noticed that fucker in the corner. I tried replaying this part but nothing comes close to looking like that image.  









 The bottom of course. All of the power is generated from the bottom. A power bottom. 




 The movie froze up at about the 59 min mark. With the drone ascemding into the air.

 Nah im content with booty calls i dont imagine ill find someone worth dating through an app. Im not saying this is my only source of dating but its effective if you want a quick hookup. 




 A lazy way of finding a booty call. Thats what i use it for atleast. Every girl Ive met through dating apps only wanted to fuck. Those girls looking for a relationship never want to meet and lose interest that same day. My experiences atleast. 




 Sony is obviously not ready for the Catalina wine mixer

 He sits and watches while he gropes himself whispering vile wishes to deaf ears. 
























 From my experience myself and everyone who has been through this. Its usually just a phase. I say give it time. 




 Are you an angel? Because i have an erection 




 If you can accomplish that i doubt anyone will want to challenge you. 




 Well since I've been using the app for almost a year I've met about 10 girls that actually wanted to meet. Thats very good for a guy like me. Im average looking i just put the basics and keep it simple. I get their attemtion by asking them about something they are interested in. Usually you can find that out on their profile. Its alot of hit and miss but its still effective 




 Im sure most girls who meet him end up liking him 




 And even more different to cokeheads 
























 God bless you for showing me this 3
 




 I want whatever drugs you are on. 




 You do realize this happened a while ago right? 




 OMG this is animal cruelty... 




 Since i went through the phase myself i listen to them and show them facts that disprove their theories. And they found out on their own as well. 




 Mostly government and ufo conspiracies.  And they all eventually lost interest when more and more of these theories were proven to be nothing more than someones wild imagination.  
























 Not the best ive seen 




 Good guy cockroach 




 They prefer "yerrow" or so I've heard.

 Ive seen kids smoking weed they didnt turn out to be the smartest or successful 10 years down the line. 




 When they get too personal about it. 




 Nope though that is only one encounter Ive had with otherworldy beings. I wasnt sleepwalking as far as I know because it was in the middle of the day.  




 If cartoons and movies have taught me anything, its that the mouse always wins.
 




 Well it was 2008 or 2009. I was at my parents house alone. I was looking for something in the guest bedroom when I felt like i was being watch. I glance over my shoulder to see it standing by the door. I did a double take and turned all the way around only to see it glide out through the doorway. I was shocked so I slowly walked to the door but it was gone. I dont remember going into the bathroom or filling up the tub. But I do remember being underwater long enough that I started seeing a white light that seemed to be getting brighter. Then the light started faded away in the distance and I regain my senses and sit up to find out Im in the tub of water. Desperately trying to catch my breathe again, I was so confused. Right next to the tub was a statue of Jesus I guess I brought into the bathroom and I kind of broke down and started crying. I haven't seen the shadow since then. 




 I have seen a few shadow people. One was a 7ft tall hooded figure standing right behind me. It freaked me out when i saw it then next thing I know Im in a tub full of water(fully clothed) with a statue of jesus next to me.
