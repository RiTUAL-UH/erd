 It has been just one year. I understand you wannabe librals want ti criticise for the sake of criticism but how do you expect a new government to radically bring down poverty in just one year? It's impractical

We have been living in a socialist system for decades now and it didn't work. Accept that. 




 How to use M. Jones to his full potential? 




 That's monstrous  




 Doesn't work though, still stuck here 




 Harry Potter and the Truman Show 




 I was surprised when that happened. Dhoni is a real cool customer usually.  




 I like the angle that Mitch bowls from, it looks really awesome  




 Thanks that really helped!

Also can you tell me if there's a mod that can help you change the location in the initial stage of the game? I remember I saw it in a video once 




 How do I know if I have all the DLC? 

My screen looks a lot like this

I've seen people with different presentation of culture, faith gold etc 




 Woah! That's something I didn't know 
























 Dick move, China.  




 Me 2 




 Yeah, Sobha Singh was a real British boot-licker. People used to call him 'adhi Delhi ka malik'

Khushwant Singh wrote about it in one of his 'Malice towards one and all' articles in HT.

I miss those articles though. Nostalgia :( 




 Mooaaaarrr!!! Need moooaaaar!!! 




 YOU HAD ONE JOB, RAHUL! 




 No, he just blows his nose over it. We all know who the Italian boot-lickers are. They've helped Antonia stay in power for a decade and still want more of her  




 Sab Kejri ke piche hath dho ke pade hai. Ab arms and ammunition rakhna bhi paap hai

#kitna gussa ata hai in logo pe 




 Yeah, it's been a while since they played Zimbabwe. 




 He's gonna make a spirit bomb 




 U.S - Pakistan is purely a employer-employee relationship. U.S throws the money and Pakistan salutes. 

Whereas with a country like India the equation is totally different. I firmly believe that the U.S India strategic partnership will be one of the defining partnerships of 21st century  
























 I am totally oblivious about Tennis, but I read about her while reading Andre Agassi's autobiography Open. I'm kinda happy she's associated with India in a positive way. Yeah, that's pretty much all I have to say.

Also she has epic legs! Face....ugh...not so much. Still a great person though! Can't take that away 




 Never fuck with a tea vendor  




 Also open borders and maybe sign a defence pact too 




 Shaka 




 That won't be enough. India must engage with Japan and invite it for joint naval exercises too 




 MCD's getting bonus this diwali! :D 




 Keep going strong! Ek din pat jayegi! 




 Translation: Subsidy be good. 

Fiscal deficit? Don't know, don't care. 




 He'll end up like C.M Punk; out of the picture 




 Pretty sure they tried it before and didn't work out all that well. 

I mean, our muslims are peaceful and we love 'em  
























 I'll add it to my list. Thanks :) 




 Don't bother arguing with the pessimists.  




 Arvind salamat rahe, free ka maal milta rahe  




 We're just more practical now, that's all. It has its advantages and disadvantages.  




 #Sab hath dho ke piche pade hai 




 "Gentlemen, let's fuck up this place as much as we can before leaving...also where's my wife?" 




 I'm used to 40 so yeah, that. -30 is something I never experienced. But y'know, maybe it won't be all that bad with the right clothing.  




 Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't we supply BrahMos to Vietnam?  




 Great places to live. I don't like those crazy winters though, my body is not used to it so moving there isn't something I might consider. But the people are good. Women are gorgeous. Education system is probably the best in the world in the Scandinavian countries, primarily Finland. We in India can certainly learn a lot from it. 

Also since most people there can speak English it's easy to communicate with 'em.  




 Delhi university. A few years ago I was walking outside the department of commerce when I saw a group of Haryanvi guys mocking some NE students for no reason whatsoever. 
One guy started making those Bruce Lee kung-fu noises and I'm pretty sure the NE students heard it but did not respond. 
 
























 That ain't cool 




 It's an open secret. Amit Shah said the same thing bluntly after the Lok Sabha elections. I'll try to post the link here. 




 Bro, dropping 30 places in the list of the most corrupt countries is kinda of a small achievement. I don't think you should start with that sentence if you are trying to highlight the rampant growing corruption in India 




 That's what I'll check tomorrow  




 Rs. 1500-2000 with 10mbps speed and around 60-80 GB data in Delhi 




 Probably not in the coming decade. Maybe after that. 

But in a way it is good as we will be able to see how this plays out in countries like U.S and learn from their mistakes/exleriences after 10 years.  




 Although I am a BJP supporter and believe that Kejriwal will eventually end up like a Lalu or Mulayam (both had a lot of expectations from people like Kejri has since both were disciples of J.P but...after a decade or so they did not turn out to be what people expected) I do think that this hike in the education expenditure is good. If it is executed properly then it could be one of the best things that ever happened to Delhi.

Moreover the play grounds of Government  schools will be available to colony kids for playing after school hours so that'll be cool too. It's a small move, but was really needed. 




 Okay then. Thanks for the advice! 




 Damned if you do, damned if you don't. At least the people who know a thing or two about diplomacy will understand the reason behind such generosity. It's a long term investment. 




 I got to know about the amature astronomers association in Delhi and decided to join it in a week or so. They basically gather at a place and do some star gazing with their telescopes.

Being a complete noob I have no idea how good the visibility is in Delhi considering the air quality. 

Any suggestions or comments?  





























 Deep down you know he wasn't.  




 It won't become a trend because of the cultural barriers. But might see a few more cases in the future. Women will go wherever they see a safe and prosperous future, but their first preference will probably be a fellow native. 




 I don't know what all the fuss is about. Modi's mother tongue is Gujarati and he has no issues with Hindi being promoted. People need to stop criticising just for the sake of criticism. I'm Punjabi and I think Hindi should be the language India should promote abroad. I mean, we can't promote all of our languages, gotta stick with one.  




 1. Astronomy - I recently joined the amature astronomers club in my city and it's been an amazing experience to say the least. I am still a newbie so I hardly know much but I think my passion is only going to grow.

1. Reading - before my last break-up I used to read a lot, but my ex-gf used to devour most of my time and then by the last few months of the relationship she turned into one  of those "crying" manipulative women. Rediscovering my love for reading has been one of the best thing I have ever done. I recently finished Brave New World and right now I'm reading Crime and Punishment by Dostoyevsky.

3. Cricket - I love Cricket. The Ashes will begin soon and I can't wait. 

4. Gaming - I like playing Civilization 5 whenever I find time. It's the best game I ever played.

5. Learning to play the Harmonica. I bought a diatonic harmonica a month ago and I spend around 30 minutes everyday practicing it. It'll take a lot of time before I learn to play my favourite songs, but the investment will be worth it. 




 Jew probably did nazi that coming 




 This needs more attention 




 CIV5 




 9/11! 

Would bang! 




 Adopting a Socialist policy and demotivating our business class in every way possible. We should have opened our markets way before 1991.  
























 Yeah, why can't he just wear clothes made of old curtains and shit in a bucket like all the other world leaders. 




 Modi probably used it for a couple of seconds and threw it away saying "wtf is this shit!' 




 There's no way we beat white people to animal fucking 




 It's simple really. I think if you wake up early you get extra hours in your day and can perform better. I have had accountability buddies in the past and it went out quite well for a few months. 
I try to wake up at 5 am everyday which requires sleeping on time too. 
If you aim at waking up at 6 or 7 am, it's fine by me. I know 5 am is a bit freakish. 

How the accountability shall work -

The moment we wake up we take a photo of our wrist watch along with a piece of paper on which we write "I am awake" 
Why?
Coz it generally means you're out of the bed now. 

If interested let me know. 




 Oh okay, just saw that 




 Like a podcast 




 Yeah like a podcast 









 For Ford's sake this book deserves more upvotes! 




 I think it's been a year since I broke up with my ex-gf. I have a tattoo of her name on my body which I intend to remove as soon as I get my finances right. It was a bad decision to get it in the first place, but...eh...mistakes happen. 

I have suffered a lot in the past few months. But having no contact with my ex has helped me a lot in moving on. It would have been even better had she not messaged me at all. She used to message me like once a week or something and I could see the display pic of her hugging her new boyfriend. She moved on very quickly after we broke up. That fact tormented me a lot.

Anyway, I'm in a better mental state now and it's been a life changing experience. I just want to say that if you're suffering right now then, just know that it will end one day and you will be able to breathe. 

There will come a day when you won't wake up in the morning with the thought of your ex in your head and the memories will begin to fade away. Just hang in there. Also if you focus on reading and some outdoor activities, it'll just help more. 

Both good times and bad times end one day.  
























 Not having kids is one of the best things you can do for yourself and the world 




 Hard to understand why people would down vote this.  




 He forgot to say Allah hafiz. Isn't that rude or something?  




 I LOVE LAMP

 It's a tough call. I'd say Laloo holds the edge but Kejri is sure growing in chutiyapa by the month 




 So that little homo flag thing at the bottom of the pic is supposed to be a hint of what we should do? 




 He doesn't want to see the difference  




 Yeah, I think it's ok to strike them 




 Hahaha!! I see what you did there! 




 Abeee kya hai ye XD 




 Laughed way too loud at this one XDXD 




 Rahul Gandhi 




 Usually I'm too preoccupied in figuring out whether I live in the matrix or not that I don't even realise if I am being sexually abused or not 




 That pretty much sums it up
