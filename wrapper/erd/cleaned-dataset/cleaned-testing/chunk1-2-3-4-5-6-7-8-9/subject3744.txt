 Youtube and netflix have been giving me all kinds of problems lately. In the last 24 hours they have slowed to a crawl and don't even load. The last year or two i have had the same issues but never this bad. I feel like verizon is trying to piss me off.

This happens with any of my systems including xbox and playstation. I've reset my router, but with my limited knowledge the tracert says it isn't even my end of the network.

 I am a middle of the road kind of person and i think the money involved in politics is mind blowing.

I grew up with grandparents on both sides, my parents vote republican. I don't see things the way they do and i seem to vote the opposite of them.

Edit - i should add that my grandparents weren't communists after reading some of these comments.
 



















 I don't have pictures at the moment, but can take some tomorrow.

While researching what product i should get, i came across [this.](http://www.alphasystemsinc.com/ProductCare) 


 Rubber roof (also known as EPDM) membranes are smooth. TPO and Alpha-Ply roof membranes have a haircel texture, which can be likened to an orange peel.


Was looking at [this product](http://www.epdmcoatings.com/rv-roof-repair.php) and it says 


 For Fleetwood models with ALPHA roofs you will need to use the ProFlex Primer



I'm pretty sure mine is a TPO/Alpha-Ply type roof since it is a Fleetwood and then would need to put down a primer before the rubber coating. The top of the RV is black in color and is not smooth so this makes me think it is not a rubber roof.


This seems the best way to fix it. 

Edit - am back from getting beers 




 Clear your social calendar. We have to cook.

 I was curious what everyone else uses for insulin for their cats. I've been using a bottle of lantus since my vet diagnosed him with diabetes, but it is almost out. The vet said he had ordered it by mistake and would let me have it for $50. When I checked the price for a bottle at the local CVS they want $230.

 I've noticed a few new accounts that have been posting lately in /r/pics and /r/funny and saw a familiar routine with a few of them. Going through the post history of these accounts led me to

/r/usedcarsforsale which is a fairly new sub and if you notice all the posts being made are by user accounts that are only a few weeks old.

if you look at some of the users that post in that sub, you will see that they are trying to post generic photos for exposure and also post the used car ads to the used car sub.

 This is true, i guess a major spoiler can be tagged as such. 




 Yes, exactly that one. I've only been to lagoon half dozen times growing up. They all were themed for ww1 i believe and there was one that was the red baron IIRC. Live out of state but often spent the summers with my cousins. That ride inspired me to become a pilot, i will one day. 




 This was before i found reddit and now i'm stuck here reading shit comments. Never ending cycle.

 OP on youtube [just posted](http://i.imgur.com/psOncPP.png) that she is friends with the owner of the dog.

edit [found a news article](http://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20150527/west-loop/dog-walker-caught-on-camera-kicking-puppy-west-loop-building)

The building's security guard, who is stationed at the entrance, noticed the beagle dog was acting odd before they entered the building's elevator, according to the property manager. At that time, the security guard watched a live video feed from the surveillance video located in the elevator on a monitor stationed near the entrance desk.

safe to say it is the right company.

 Black smoke , which it mostly was, is oxygen starved.

Was there black smoke in the OP video? 

I'm not going to argue, got better shit to do. 




 You sound like you don't understand how convection works. Put a shit ton of combustibles in a highrise, air flows up the elevator shafts and supplies a constant flow of oxygen to it. That is how you get such high temperatures. 




 I'll let it slide because of that boner inducing slap sound.

 [This map](http://i.imgur.com/8cSk8ye.jpg) shows it better than i can explain it but it isn't exactly to scale. Mainly has do with geography of the area of the LA basin. The southern most point of the california aqueduct ends at [silverwood lake](https://goo.gl/maps/Xk0Je) which feeds the high desert mainly Hesperia/Victorville. You can see the aqueduct in the top of the google map link.

The colorado aqueduct feeds into [lake Mathews](https://goo.gl/maps/qQgvj) in Riverside. You can't see the aqueduct in the supplied link because it mostly runs underground after it reaches the mountains [around here](https://goo.gl/maps/JwVJF) via the San Jacinto tunnel.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_River_Aqueduct

On the first map i link, i live in that area marked as groundwater to the east of LA. 




 i know what his problem is 




 Was just giving an example of it's location on the east side of the Rockies. Did i say anything about the water level on the google maps link? 




 Why i took the time to explain it without being a dick. I enjoy being able to ask questions in subs meant for other countries about the context. Usually everyone is really nice about it and offers a good explanation. 




  [Strontia Springs Reservoir](https://goo.gl/maps/OYk0i) 

Unfortunately it is on the wrong side of the rockies.
 




 Guy in red (runner) needs be touched by the ball before he touches the 3rd base.  Since Trout was able to touch the base and keep his foot on it before the ball touches him he is considered safe. If there was another runner on second base, the third baseman only needs to touch the base before the runner does.  




 Watched it live and couldn't believe it until like the 3rd replay. 




 Colorado river only feeds SoCal and not much of the LA area, Mainly Riverside and San Diego and parts of San Bernardino. All of the central valley gets its water from the north part of the state. 




 Only time will tell when the wall goes up to divide the rich from the poor. 




 Yes by "old stone" i meant that in the same context that i stated. OP has mentioned countless times on how he wants his landscaping and showed how he wants to enjoy his "Backyard." 

I am happy you used the term "usanians," it should be used more often in this same context. We are all the product of the same experiment. 

edit - wow i sound like a drunk asshole... someone be my friend 




 Do you have any luck with that username? 




 I'm sure it it easier to get rid of old stone in the US compared to some of the older cities with history of those kind of stones in Europe. 




 The stone was ugly as shit, love how your project turned out.

 No shit? If you are aggressive on the way you pursue them it is just going to make them drive even more insane. Exactly what this video shows. He could have tried to keep his distance which at the 4 minute mark he was told to do so but ignored it. Even saying traffic wasn't as bad as it actually is, if you can't safely narrow down a search area after you break off a pursuit, then you don't have enough officers that clearly are needed.

It isn't like the bank robber went in and shot the place up like north hollywood. Once he robs a bank the FBI are involved, no reason to jeopardise my family or your family to capture a guy that can get away with a few thousands dollars only to be captured in a better and easier way later. Why escalate a deadly situation even more by provoking a suspect? Up until the end a single officer was in pursuit of a vehicle and it caused more danger to the public than putting a dangerous bank robber into custody.

edit - I love how you immediately downvote because you disagree

 




 /r/thebox  




 I'm guessing the new one you are talking about is the one in the second link. 




 it's life. 




 Canadian engineer here. Believe it or not, their job page was officially named RIMjobs at one time. /facepalm 




 Am i the only one that thinks the aggressive speeds reached in traffic are more reckless than a bank robber getting away with insured money? If you have to put this many innocent people in danger to get one guy of the street, when should you say protecting the innocent is more important?


Edit - Even at the 4 minute mark the other officer says to disengage the pursuit and the main officer says copy, but continues to pursue when it gets the most dangerous.  




 Prob would if they were in the lower section. 




 I used to install alarms for 10 years, using [this](http://www.xpresskit.com/product.aspx?productid=43) you could do what you want. The original key goes inside the box and gets hidden in the dash, then has a transmitting wire that feeds the unique keyfob up to the cylinder. You can use any kind of metal key after you set this up.

Just realized the first link is discontinued, this is the [newer version](http://www.xpresskit.com/product.aspx?productid=44) of the same product but i have never installed one.

 Went there in elementary school on a field trip, but we just went around and looked at the plants. There was no education that a elementary school kid will remember. 




 Seems to be heading that way, I wouldn't exactly say MTV picked on the kid like /u/Paradiselost541 says. It gives you an insight into his head and try to understand what he thinks. Gives people more context into what someone with a learning disability deals with and can comprehend the world they live in.

 Ex gf had a 17 year old cat that lost her vision suddenly, retinas just suddenly started giving and detached. We got rid of the bedframe to the bed and just put the box spring and mattress on the floor. The cat would sometimes forget about the drop off and walk of the end of the bed until she got used to it. She still knew where the food and litter box was and figured out how to reach the living room. Sometimes running into things getting used to it and where everything was.

 The two recommended to me were [Buffalo Grass](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouteloua_dactyloides) or [Zoysia grass](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoysia).

Currently most of my lawn is at least 4 different types, Mostly invaded by crabgrass, which  results in [this](http://i.imgur.com/C98MKpw.jpg). After renting an industrial power rake.

My whole lawn has a mixture of permanent shade and sun.

Please help...

edit - i know St Augustine is used around here a lot, will have to use the identification tool to find how what types i have currently, the shaded areas are different type than the ones in the sun. I also need to get rid of the shade that is currently there, the two trees that provide the shade are very old and termite infested. They are on the curbside, and would have to get the city to remove them.

 You can always use a sharp knife to cut underneath it. 




 Ah makes sense then, as long as he has a job in the area it isn't a problem. The 15/91 is a pain in rush hour and i have spent a decent amount of time on both of them. I live in Ontario, when you said IE i thought more like Riverside/MoVal. That can be brutal to your life if you commute to LA or even the OC.

 US heavy bombs are all now gps guided, they don't need to carpet bomb like vietnam anymore. B-52s can hit a separate target with each bomb it has at the same time.

In WW2 the US didn't have precision bombs. Altitude and wind currents would miss targets by miles. That is why whole cities were bombed. The only cities that were bombed were considered industry that supported the Axis,  cities weren't carelessly bombed at random.

 The group was founded in 1949 and grew organically before expanding rapidly through a series of acquisitions in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and was formerly known as the Ratner Group.

Gerald Ratner who built it from 130 stores to 2500, a previous CEO, made possibly the most famous gaffe in twentieth century British business when he explained to a major business conference that the reason why one of his products was so cheap was that it was "total crap". He then went on to unfavourably compare some of the company's earrings with a 99p prawn sandwich. His remarks were gleefully reported by the media, The company lost over 500 million pounds off its share price and consumers subsequently avoided the Ratner branded stores, nearly 300 of which were closed between January 1992 and May 1994 as the group went through a financial restructuring. Ratner resigned in November 1992 and the group changed its name to Signet Group plc in September 1993.

The company moved its primary stock market listing from the London to the New York Stock Exchange on September 11, 2008, changing its name to Signet Jewelers Limited in the process.[4] The firm also moved its country of domicile from the United Kingdom to Bermuda on the same day,[5] although it retains operational headquarters in the Jewellery Quarter, Birmingham.

Company have a bad name? Just rename it and move it to a new location.

Investigators say the man used a cigarette lighter to ignite gas fumes when he got back into his car.

"My initial impression is based on the fact he was at a gas station, it was probably gasoline, we got some samples we took from inside the car and will send out to the state arson lab to see what exactly burned up inside there, said AFD Capt. Andy Reardon.

 You local gas station pumps don't give you the amount of gas that you paid for, you realize this and report it to the county. They send out the county weight and measurements department and test it.

 Don't think looking at their own reflection is a good example. Maybe kittens that have never seen a mirror before react to the reflection but that is just their nature running into another cat they don't recognise. I've never had any of my cats after their first experience with a mirror react that way the next time they experience it. My cat Pizza loves to sleep in the bathroom, and most of the time when you come in he will look at you through the mirror. When i start getting close enough to him he will turn his head and look at me directly.

Wasn't there a "Through the wormhole with Morgan Freeman" episode where they were talking about when humans become self conscious? One of the big factors was recognizing themselves in a mirror?

 Cigarette breaks were an intermittent part of my work day.

Every job i've had let me choose when to take my breaks, didn't even matter if i went out and have a quick smoke whenever i wanted.
I've never actually tried to quit. The longest i went without a smoke was 2 days after 15 years, and that was because i was in jail. 

I have a computer in my garage for i can smoke n surf the web. Just rearranged my room to fit my desk and computer in there earlier. Desk and computer are going in tomorrow and will try to quit cold turkey. I just happened to catch your post on /r/all/new and wanted to give you support.

 HOWEVER, the video does show several other people attempting to either get the girl off the ground (interfering in police work), or something a bit more nefarious.

Would agree the actions leading up to that point would warrant a show of force, but think he should have defended himself with pepper spray instead. He was putting himself in danger trying to detain someone that was "running their mouth."

The good news here is that no one was hurt.

 Even if he is right, just shows that this community and HOA have views that go against the grain. Yes it might be private property and they had every right to call the cops. The way it was handled was the opposite of what the nation saw as right. 

The blame really comes down to the original person to tweet out that there was a pool party. A young inexperienced promoter decides to turn a private pool party into a rave and have a DJ show up? Would seem most of the blame would be on the original graduate, that lives in that community, that invited a couple friends over against the rules of that community.

The Games were also financially successful raising more money with fewer sponsors than any prior Olympic Games, which left SLOC with a surplus of $40 million. The surplus was used to create the Utah Athletic Foundation, which maintains and operates many of the remaining Olympic venues.

 It is super fun to visit. I recommend take a flightseeing tour and going to the Alyeska resort.

 Traffic on the 5 can move at a fast pace. About 10 years ago i was driving north to see some friends. Had a corvette pass me doing about 100 so i sped up and just matched his pace. We probably went 50 miles at that speed, granted i had a radar detector and i guess he did as well. The vette crested a hill and immediately started to slow down, as soon as i crested i got a laser warning. After we were out of view we sped back up again.

I've even seen packs of 5+ cars being pulled over by a single CHP before. 




 Whatever drugs you are on, i want some. 




 I'm surprised they can't take the wings off.

 Thanks to your comment i was able to find the video source. 
























 Always nice and shiny without a single water spot.  




 Why do i think i'm going to see the posted all over the place the rest of the day. 




 Usually they aren't 6 miles deep and 50 miles away from the nearest city. 




 wait... The top post less than 2 hours old has /u/iBleeedorange commenting on it? Did Earth's magnetic field shift? Usually you are the top of the frontpage and others are commenting on it.

Thanks for the kind words stranger. 









 RIP Eric 




 /r/justflewintotheshop

Can't believe it is actually real. 




 Gave it to myself actually. 




 Why would you act against the grain online, and not care about others finding your point of view offline offensive. You make friends with like minded people, and if they don't agree with you then they aren't friends anyways. 




 Touche 




 They can be pretty scary. 




 I did care, but i've learned not to care what other people think of me. Life is better when you live your life the way you want. Unless drugs are involved, that would probably get me in trouble. 




 You can have a private life on the internet without commenting. Yes i think anonymity is important as far as what you want see on the net, but why would you need to censor yourself for what you say? 




 Then why are they your friend? 




 This is actually a good point. Wonder if there would be a way to get around this. 




 I'm not worried about what i say, my friends and family know how i stand. Any job that fires me or won't hire me for what i say, i don't want to work there anyways. 




 Why can't you say what you want without your name attached to the comment?

I can see why if your government will punish you for your free speech.  




 Radar Detector 




 I probably have over a million miles driven from Santa Barbara to San Diego. I've had this happen countless times. Amazing how many times i've seen an accident like this happen. 
 




 You are absolutely right, wish i saw your comment before i started the same argument up above. 




 Without the video evidence then yes you would probably be liable for it, if there wasn't a reliable witness involved. 

With the video evidence it would still be considered a no-fault accident, and i'm sure the insurance company would sue the PT driver for causing the accident. 

Reason why dashcams are needed, wonder what OP's insurance company would say if they saw this video. 




 What would you do at the 7 second mark of the video if this was you driving? 




 Thanks for saying what i wanted to say. 




 The PT cruiser's angle of attack was too steep, it always looked like he was going to keep coming across the lanes.

Couldn't have said it better myself, thanks. 




 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb4iFLrTeSo 




 Amazing when you learn how long a plack second is.

 









 Didn't blame the cammer, just said it was avoidable.

Edit - This is probably the first video i've seen on here that i thought was avoidable.  




 LMFAO only if you really knew me.

Edit - Thanks for the flair 




 Sounds like too much work, i am lazy. 




 I agree, but this was avoidable if OP just let of his gas when he saw cars merging ahead of him. At the 7 second mark on the video, i would have started to get into the left lane or let off the gas to see if they stay in their lane. 




 Pretty sure your insurance would be paying for both vehicles repairs, but it would be considered a no-fault accident.

Then the insurance company would try to sue the PT driver for causing the accident. 




 If you keep an eye on your mirrors and watch the traffic around you, you can keep a mental map of the traffic around you.

You don't have to predict the future, just don't expect that driver to stay in the lane they are suppose to after merging. 




 Even if you have video evidence of trying to avoid an accident? 




 Whenever i see cars merging onto the highway i will do exactly what you said. If i knew there was a car in the lane next to me, i would have let off the gas when i saw the cars starting to merge to avoid OP's situation. 




 If you keep aware of your surroundings you would know if there was a car there or not. Even so, OP had plenty of time just lay off the gas and coast to slow down when he saw cars merging. Maybe OP was in a zone and not aware of his surroundings. 

Pretty sure if he had done this, the PT would have merged in front of him without even having to touch the brakes.

Even so he has video evidence that proves he was trying to avoid an accident.  




 They probably drive just like OP. Guess growing up in LA traffic has made me more aware of other drivers. 

Even just watching the video made me want to slow down seeing the traffic merge. He practically drove into her blind spot.

Don't get me wrong, the PT is completely at fault. 

Edit - I will take the downvotes because this was completely avoidable accident.  




 If OP were to apply the brakes (not slam on them) and make a move to the left lane, that PT wouldn't have hit OP. Why is his first reaction to just honk the horn? If you are a defensive driver you would be letting off the gas and slowing down and ready to hit the brakes moments before OP just honks his horn. OP didn't even try to slow down even after he honks.

Even if there was a car in the next lane that OP hits trying to evade, he has video evidence he was trying to avoid an accident.

20 years of driving defensively i haven't been in any accidents, and have been in OP's situation many times. Don't expect other drivers to be paying attention at all times, especially when they are merging in the lane next to you. 




 Exactly how i do it. Build it hot then starve it of oxygen. Usually can leave it alone for hours only really having to open vents a lil bit of time to maintain temp. 




 Well you are the ones with the guns. 




 Only if you do it in a panic. 

hoping the impact might be a bit lighter

OP had enough time to realize what was happening for him to honk his horn, instead of making a controlled maneuver to evade. By the time the other driver has time to realize what the honk was for, OP could have got into the other lane. 




 Why didn't you try to evade him instead of honking your horn?

Edit - ~~I'm not going to try to argue this anymore~~, this accident could have been avoided if OP was a defensive driver.

edit2 - Just realized that another comment was downvoted to hell for saying the samething.

/u/Malfeasant describes [this perfectly](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roadcam/comments/3ackon/pt_cruiser_owners_are_the_worst_drivers/csbiu80). If any of you have ever ridden a motorcycle you would understand.

 Anytime there is a crime involved in this magnitude the FBI would either take over the investigation or at least aid with all resources available. 




 I'm sorry, i am on the border of being drunk. If you were to depend on new comments with gold standards you would still have to filter through all the bullshit trolls. 




 Even though reddit is great for providing the first info, it all comes from an original source. 

For a start, [follow these local stations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_in_Charleston,_South_Carolina#Major_network_television_affiliates) on all social media platforms. Then follow the hashtags would be a decent start. 




 If you need gold benefits to find new info, then you don't know how to work social media well enough. Not hard to find the breaking news if you know how to find it. 




 Even if this quote "rifle behind every blade of grass" isn't really made by Isoroku Yamamoto, it speaks the truth.

 In 1960, Robert Menard was a commander aboard the USS Constellation when he was part of a meeting between United States Navy personnel and their counterparts in the Japanese Defense Forces.
Fifteen years had passed since VJ Day, most of those at the meeting were WWII veterans, and men who had fought each other to the death at sea were now comrades in battle who could confide in each other.
Someone at the table asked a Japanese admiral why, with the Pacific Fleet devastated at Pearl Harbor and the mainland U.S. forces in what Japan had to know was a pathetic state of unreadiness, Japan had not simply invaded the West Coast.
Commander Menard would never forget the crafty look on the Japanese commander's face as he frankly answered the question.
'You are right,' he told the Americans. 'We did indeed know much about your preparedness. We knew that probably every second home in your country contained firearms. We knew that your country actually had state championships for private citizens shooting military rifles. We were not fools to set foot in such quicksand.' 




 Worse than a troll if you ask me. 




 Also live on the west coast and got home to find this thread. Granted i was in the ER an hour before this started.

 The CJ crowd is powerful and can make threads go to the frontpage very quickly. They don't stay there for long after it is thrown in front of the whole site which will start to downvote it.

Even comments about racism in the defaults don't stay visible for long. Just look at the whole FPH situation, right after the ban they flooded the front page quickly. When the rest of the site caught on to what happened, does that content still reach the frontpage today?

 It is probably a company that provides fencing for construction sites. So i would imagine it could be found almost on every single construction site.

From their website is seems they provide scaffolding so you could probably find it in several different places in the image. 




 Honestly didn't think i would find it. Figured it would have to be close to the camera and just zoomed in on the bottom left of the image. Looked at [this sign](http://i.imgur.com/e5KgeeE.png) for a minute then zoomed out a bit. When i saw that [blue/white portion](http://i.imgur.com/MNagPnR.png) i had a hunch that there was a sign on it. Couldn't believe i found it when i zoomed in to see if it was a sign.

 Don't believe he was trying to defend OP. Just letting everyone know how much it costs to charge an electric vehicle.  




 It was kind of a full body seizure. As soon as i found him it took several minutes of petting and talking to him to get him to stop. Had a very thick drool both times. After he seemed very riled up for 5 - 10 minutes. 

Just scary because at of all the cats i have had, he is the first one to have seizures.

 Did some searching because i have damaged some plastics with it before. I have used it in car audio for years to clean glue and stains from carpets. 

Found [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/1xurvh/ipad_cleaned_with_acetone/cfex21o) that explains which plastics are vulnerable to acetone. 

Acetone is great at dissolving common domestic polymers like polystyrene, polyethylene, PET etc, alcohols are pretty crappy at it. Acetone is also more likely to swell even specialized polymers

Also found [this on another forum](http://forums.reprap.org/read.php?70,84367,85439#msg-85439) that says it will dissolve acrylic which your counter top was most likely made of.

Hopefully someone that knows chemistry can explain why.

 I'm normally not, but if you didn't start [being the prick first](https://www.reddit.com/r/rickandmorty/comments/3bk0he/episodes_1_and_2_are_leaked_from_season_2/csp73x0), I wouldn't have been an asshole. Maybe if you had any reading comprehension you would understand that my first comment was never saying anything about hulu. 

Yes your comment that i first replied to was about sitting through 30 second commercials was no big deal. My reply was stating that i have sat through so many commercials in my lifetime, i will do the most i can to avoid them completely. Had nothing to do with hulu.

You don't watch 18 minutes of ads on hulu, you watch 18 minutes of ads on cable. 

I never said anything about watching hulu.

Honestly, big deal. Perhaps many of you are younger, but if you told me 20 years ago that I could watch practically any show I wanted at my command for practically nothing ($8/month is nothing), and all I had to put up with was a few commercials, I'd have shit myself. It's not hard to put it on mute for 30 seconds. Seriously, there's worse things that could happen to you in life than having to endure a short ad.

You never even mention hulu in the comment i replied to. You could have been speaking of any streaming service. That's why i pay $11 a month for netflix. I don't ever want to see a commercial unless i absolutely have to.

 What if you could care less about getting a coupon for free ice cream? I would be pissed if i was pulled over and given a coupon for obeying traffic laws.

Maybe they should just take note of the license plate and mail it to the registered address. 




 Maybe i should point out that i am not trying to argue about the spill itself, but that the dead zone exists. 

 




 You might have active sealife on the coasts and near the surface. You won't have life at the bottom like plants where all the chemicals settle. 

This is a problem associated with every delta in the world. It's just worst because the Mississippi river basin covers 47% of the continent of the US.

Maybe if you actually learn how ecosystems worked, i wouldn't have to sit "behind a keyboard and googling shit." 




 If you are asking about the [dead zone source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_zone_\(ecology\)#Gulf_of_Mexico_.27Dead_Zone.27). 




 Your right. Most of the area around the Mississippi delta is pretty much dead. There is a ton of shit that comes down that river like pesticides/fertilizer used in agriculture that has killed a vast area of life around the delta.

Edit to add sources

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_zone_(ecology)

The area of temporary hypoxic bottom water that occurs most summers off the coast of Louisiana in the Gulf of Mexico [13] is the largest recurring hypoxic zone in the United States.[14] The Mississippi River, which is the drainage area for 41% of the continental United States, dumps high-nutrient runoff such as nitrogen and phosphorus into the Gulf of Mexico. According to a 2009 fact sheet created by NOAA, "seventy percent of nutrient loads that cause hypoxia are a result of this vast drainage basin."[15] which includes the heart of U.S. agribusiness, the Midwest. The discharge of treated sewage from urban areas (pop. c 12 million in 2009) combined with agricultural runoff deliver c. 1.7 million tons of phosphorus and nitrogen into the Gulf of Mexico every year.[15]

Edit - Should point out i'm not arguing the spill itself, but that the dead zone exists.

 Without video evidence it would be hard to say. This is why we need cameras on cops. I come from a family of cops and have been abused by cops as well. 

I might be part of the anti cop cj but most of it is justified, just like most of it isn't. Why we need video evidence of all interactions of pd and the public.  




 Ya we hugged it to death...

 LA is full of transplants from all over the place. Pretty sure the Boston games coming up will be the same. 




 You're right, the bay harbor butcher. IIRC he really isn't the butcher but his kills are counted as the butchers. 




 Depends on what and how you burn them i suppose.

Not all countries can provide clean ways of burning fossil fuels. Greece still provides 50% of their power by burning lignite which is probably the lowest form of carbon content. They would have to burn way more than a plant burning coal.  




 Which is funny because most of the power to charge them comes from burning fossil fuels. 




 so many yankee fans there 




 Isn't the butcher Dexter's brother? 




 ah thanks, just started hanging out here during games.  




 what is with the rally spider thing? Did i miss something? 




 As well as representing your community in the TV ratings, you will receive a gift for your participation.

You would think they actually paid you for actually having to put an effort into pushing a button on/off next to your TV. 




 Not that hard to make. 




 You don't watch 18 minutes of ads on hulu

Did i say anything about hulu?

I hardly ever watch TV, only live tv i watch is pretty much sports. 

How do you think the content creators fund their projects?

No shit sherlock

If i like something i will actually buy the DVDs instead of sit through even a few 30 seconds commercials on hulu.

I will wait months to watch something on netflix instead of seeing it the day after it airs even with a few commercials. 
 




 I'm not young and i think i've gave to much of my life to advertisers already.

A one hour show is only about 42 minutes of actual content. 18 minutes of ads is way too much and usually they are the same commercials repeated.  




 I'm here if you need to talk.

 The lights you were seeing is everyone holding up their phones and using the flashlight feature. Started last year IIRC, just something they decided to start doing during games after it starts getting dark.  




 Talking about the cellphone flashlights? Have you been to a game in the last couple years?

 They initially faced the possibility of life in prison on murder charges, but pleaded guilty to lesser charges of voluntary manslaughter and assault.

There are two different charges because they took a plea deal. They were initially charged with murder.

So yes he is a murderer. 




 They initially faced the possibility of life in prison on murder charges, but pleaded guilty to lesser charges of voluntary manslaughter and assault.

You were right OP, they are murderers but took a plea deal that reduced the charges to manslaughter.

 In CA is illegal for them to expire unless they were given out for a promotion or to employees.

Most gift certificates and gift cards sold by retail sellers for use with the seller and its affiliates cannot contain an expiration date or a service fee, including a fee for dormancy.

and is pretty much considered legal tender, since it basically is a pre-paid credit card.

Any gift certificate sold after January 1, 1997, is redeemable in cash for its cash value, or subject to replacement with a new gift certificate at no cost to the purchaser or holder.4 Effective January 1, 2008, any gift certificate with a cash value of less than $10 is redeemable in cash, which includes currency or check, for its cash value.

http://www.dca.ca.gov/publications/legal_guides/s-11.shtml 




 In 2009, Congress passed the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure (CARD) Act, which set consumer protections for gift cards based on many state laws. The law provides that gift cards cannot expire within five years from the date they were activated and generally limits inactivity fee on gift cards except in certain circumstances, such as if there has been no transaction for at least 12 months. The federal law creates a floor for regulation and leaves room for state regulation on redeeming gift cards for cash and unclaimed property provisions.

ah 5 year limit, just noticed OP's was issued in 2013. 




 Why is there an expiration date? I thought that was illegal?

 Seems it burns for the first 2 hours, maybe not a burn but makes me  want to scratch it. Hasn't affected me otherwise, it helps a lot actually. 

Edit to add - i have been switching sides of the body. 




 Was getting ready to leave the house when i saw your comment. Was about the same time i had to replace the patch, so i put it on the back of my shoulder. Actually seems like it will work a lot better.

Thanks

Is the burning sensation normal? I'm assuming it is. 




 I just started yesterday and have been placing them on my arms. Just by normal movement it will develop an area that will start to come off. Would it help to place on the inside part of my arm? 









 That is why you use the rule of 3.

 Makes you wonder what their tolerances started out at, and how they got to where they are now.  




 I estimate that this was retired only after 8 years. I worked in a plastic factory and I assume that this would do 4 cycles a min. Times that by 60 for an hour, times that by 24 for a day ( most plastic factories run 24/7 due to the fact that the injectors would fill with hard plastic if left off over night ) then times that by about 365 gives you about 134 million bricks. Now I say 8 years cause there is down time for maintainiance and colour changes. If anyone has a better time frame I would like to know what you think.
