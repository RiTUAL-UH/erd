 The Ricky Gervais Show 




 *Hello,* Nedry 




 I sorta felt that Rise was both Escape and Conquest, while Dawn was more Conquest/Battle - either this will just be Battle, or Battle/Apes 




 I hope they change it to War *on* the Planet of the Apes, I think that sounds better 









 Too bad for you man 




 Seriously, that stuff is incredible 




 Well, thankfully it wasn't Hank Azaria or one of the main family members - I don't think they'd be able to go on without them 




 Huh 




  uses his God powers to send these legitimate practical effects to his son and our savior, Jorge Millir 




 Disney knows what they're doing 




 I Love Lucy 




 It's like poetry, it rhymes.

FTFY 




 Scrambled 




 They're kinda cute, actually. 




 If you could give birth to an animal, what would it be? 




 Okaya I wonta 




 Well, it didn't take me that long to make - I'll try to clean it up a little - add music, make the cuts a little less rough - what else? 




 Empire Strikes Back, Godfather Part II, LotR: Return of the King, The Dark Knight 




 What, the 5 minutes it took me to make? 




 So it's okay to put a written version of this plot leak, but not a visual? 




 Oh shoot! 57 seconds of your precious life down the drain!

Oh, and no one forced you to watch it. 




 Soylent Green... IS PEOPLE! 




 Nah, it's the same thing has having a nose in the middle of your face - it's right there, and it seems like it would be a distraction, but you don't really notice it. 




 Yeah, I can't believe they gave him those 3 Oscars! Ugh, how stupid of those "academy members" to reward good filmmaking! 




 Throw up your hands and raise your voice! 




 The ring came off my pudding can! 




 Well, sorta Jar Jar for giving Palpatine his power  




 Ricky Gervais' stand up is pretty hilarious  




 Yeah, but the question wasn't "which fact do you not believe is true?" 




 That's not only not socially acceptable, but insane. I hope you were joking. 




 That's where, we found... 




 Any way the wind blows, 




 My favorite

 The Man Who Knew Too Much 




 Yup, because the only people who see these billion dollar movies are mouth breathing fanboys.

Sorry 









 Then post it in /r/musicvideos or something. 




 So May 1994?

 Really? I've never heard of this vastly underrated film! 




 Right, but they are 2 completely different mediums. Paintings can use visual storytelling, doesn't mean it's something you discuss in a movie-focused setting. 




 I can't wait till they release a new LEGO Star Wars game with TFA included 




 Why is this being asked in /r/movies? 




 Really? And all the other fake plot rumors and trailer "leaks" aren't? At least I'm reporting on a piece of news that's actually true... 




 Who was making that point? 




 Ugh, I guess I have to:

Le *Interstellar* 




 You can't try a food for the first time and not like it, and then have someone explain why they like it and it changes your opinion.

I totally agree. 




 C'mon, it's not *that* expensive  




 No, it's just the article with the same pics 




 Yuuuuppp 




 Well, everything about this looks more promising than the prequels... 




 No - I just meant I have it digitally - i don't have early access or anything. Besides, im sure it'll be online Monday. 




 In the Apple newsstand store 




 I meant out digitally - it's not like I have exclusive access to it or something... 




 Yeah, it was sorta obvious.

Just tryin' to be a good person. 




 Actually, Empire Strikes Back is the Pig in the City of Star Wars movies 









 Alright, but you're the one who couldn't understand a simple joke. I really couldn't care less. 




 Seriously, I'm confused now. I'd love to help you explain it, but now I'm not even sure what you're referring to. 




 Ewan McGregor as Obi Wan 




 Less than 5 years ago, this was just a dream. And now it's actually happening. I can't believe it.

I hope it doesn't suck! (It won't) 




 I'm glad they're taking the starting-over route, and the ending leaves a lot of possibilities as well.

Thoughts? 









 I was having this debate with a friend the other day, and he said that a movie doesn't need to have a central lesson or message to take away from it to be good.

I disagreed, and I still think it's one of the most important parts of film.

What do you think? What (well-liked) movies don't have this, but are still good? 




 Lord Nolan also appreciates the Kevin James directed psychosomatic-thriller.









ayy lmao 




 Now don't get me wrong. The Dark Knight is not, by any means, a bad movie. It is well acted, well directed, and very well put together. But as a superhero movie, and as a movie in general, it falls down in a few places.

1 We don't get emotionally involved with our characters. In movies like Superman or Spider-Man, our characters show that they are humans, and they have struggles. Superman literally moves the world back in time to save the person he loves. Spider-Man never knows whether he should reveal his true self to his friends and enemies. Batman just says he's the good guy. He doesn't show it, and you probably wouldn't care if he died.

2 Why so much violence? Seriously, why does every car or building need to get shot at or blown up? It should be a battle between the hero and the villain, not the hero and the villain and the rest of the world. It doesn't need to happen, and it shouldn't. Maybe a few times, but it shouldn't detract from the story itself.

TL,DR: - this is NOT a bad movie, but there are much better superhero films

EDIT: or a 94% on RT, the ideas still apply 




 Sometime before or after the release of The Godfather Part III, Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola came up with a potential sequel idea. It would have been a similar style to Part II, switching back and forth from Vito's early days as Don in the 1930s (as well as the early years of his children's lives), and Vincent as the new Don in the 1980s. Vincent takes a turn from his predecessors, and gets the Corleone family involved with narcotics again. It would have ended with his death. 

More info can be found [here](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Corleone), under "abandoned sequel"

Do you think this could've worked? 









 I have a friend who literally cannot watch movies made before the year 2000. 

Some examples:

Thought that Star Wars was "too slow," Back to the Future is "cheesy" and Hitchcock is boring.

I need a 20th century movie that quickly gets into the plot, looks good, has a good pace, and good acting. His favorite movies are The Social Network and Nightcrawler.

I hope someone can help! 




 My reaction after seeing it again:

Good stuff:
- Thoroughly enjoyable
- Not lazily made or incompetently made
- Basically a dino horror movie

Bad stuff:
- Sort of a stereotypical plot
- Kind of the same movie as 1 and 2 
























 I feel like Stanley Kubrick and George Orwell's novels were perfect for each other. Animal Farm and 1984 have similar concepts and themes as A Clockwork Orange, 2001, and Dr. Strangelove.

What do you guys think? 



















 Either unprotected or with a space suit -

How would it be different than on Earth? 




 Best letter ayy lmao amirite???

 




 It's called 2001: A Space Odyssey 




 Mine are:

4) Casino Royale

2) Skyfall

1) Goldfinger 




 If one were to make a re edited version of Return of the Jedi, what would the basic plot look like? What would needed to be changed/taken out? 




 An idea I had for the highest grossing movie of all time:

Director: Christopher Nolan 

Producer: James Cameron

Writers: Joss Whedon +                      
              Quentin Tarantino

Starring: Leonardo Di Caprio, Christian 
               Bale, Jennifer Lawrence, 
               Scarlett Johansson

Music: Hans Zimmer

Cinematography: Emmanuel Lubezki

Visual Effects: Weta Digital


What would you pick? Anything to add or change? 

EDIT: Spielberg as co director, also with Chris Pratt

EDIT 2: The plot is a cross between Interstellar, Inception, and Guardians of the Galaxy. Obviously. 




 I also thought John Wick and CHAPPiE were amaze

Cinnamontography A+++ 




 Mine are:

Star Wars
Jaws
Jurassic Park
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade
Planet of the Apes
Back to the Future
Rope
Singin in the Rain
All the President's Men
12 Angry Men 









 Ex:

Half Life 3 speed run record, set on May 27th 3476 









 IMO they're all great. 









 I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask, but which movie was the one where Rocky said "every champion was once a contender who refused to give up?" 




 Like, he wanted to prove to everyone that he could make a movie on his own and it was really just a foreshadowing of what the prequels would bring... 
























 Super Smash Brothers Drift (Kart Racing/Fighting game)

You would be able to play as all the characters from the most recent SSB game, with their own customizable racing karts.

The style of the game would be somewhat different than other racers like Mario Kart - you can choose to compete with 4 - 12 players on a variety of tracks. 

But here's the twist - there's no finish line - you are continually moving around the chosen track. The position of the players is determined by a damage meter/percentage, like that of the real SSB games. You can use a multitude of attacks on other players, including bumping into other karts, and launching projectiles. Items and power ups would be scattered around the track, and whomever has the least damage when the time limit is up wins the game.

This is just an idea I had and I would love to here your opinions. I'm working on some concept art for the game, which I'll post later. 









 On the Club Nintendo website it says that new rewards are coming January 19th. 

2 things:

When today will we be getting new rewards?

What rewards do you think they'll be?

Personally, I have a lot of points to spend, so I'm hoping for some good 3DS downloads... 




 Only 11 months from today!

When do you think we'll see a poster? 









 This is kind of a stupid theory, but I'll share it anyway:

As we all know, Nintendo's first few consoles were the NES, SNES, N64, and the Gamecube. Then, we had the Wii, followed by the Wii U. 

See any similarities yet? Well, it's a bit of a stretch, but both the NES and the Wii were succeeded by consoles that had the same name, with an extra letter added. This could be totally insignificant, but could the next console be the Nintendo 128 (or something along those lines) followed by the Nintendo Videosphere? Only time will tell...


TL;DR - theory about console naming

 Nice try Plankton. 




 A long, long time ago...

There are two directions this one could take 




 Even still, we shouldn't make the assumption that this is actually what goes down in the movie. For all we know, none of it could be true. 




 Yes 




 So a crossover with two movies that involve cars and crazy stunts with lots of action would be crazy? I don't see how that couldn't work other than the time period difference... 




 Was it ever NOT gonna be a good movie? 




 Could someone please link me to the episode or clip where Rich says "mopies" instead of movies? 




 I dunno, I thought this season was a big improvement over the last few. Did you see the finale last week? It was actually pretty good! 




 I gave someone a link to something I found through an easy Google search

 I disagree, at least with them being bad. The visual effects in the prequels were ahead of their time and they hold up pretty well today. 




 What?? 




 So you ask for people's interpretations, but then you say that their arguments are invalid, despite the fact that they are based on logic? 




 My two favorites will always be Bootleg Pokemon and Takeshi's Challenge. On the other hand, I'd have to say that his earliest stuff isn't very good.

 Sure - I'll get right on it 









 I would think they save it for D23 




 That's possible

 Well, he was sorta the key to all of it, he was a funnier character than they've ever had 




 I thought that was also in The Clone Wars from 2003 




 7 months from today, Star Wars The Force Awakens will be released in theaters.

When do you think we'll see another poster or teaser? 




 Haha! Women in a movie! I thought that was so hilarious!

/s 




 Oh it definitely matters how good it is. Would you rather have 1 bad movie about and influential figure or 2 movies, one of which will be excellent? 




 Yeah, but this'll be good. 




 Who cares? I think they're funny and entertaining, it doesn't make a difference to me if they aren't actually legitimate film critics. 




 Exactly! 




 So you've seen every film in existence and know for a fact that he is the only man who's ever slowed down the frame rate of a shot? 




 Source? 




 So? Seriously, what is so revolutionary about that? Did he invent some new technology? Is he the first person to ever do this? 




 So I would be praised for revolutionizing the art of film by putting a couple of slow motion shots in my movie? I know that's simplifying what Miller did by a lot, but the principle still applies. 




 But the ability to express the characters in terms of audio and visuals is unique to filmmaking. It gives you a clearer picture of who someone is and what their motivations are. 




 More so than a movie like Star Wars? Jurassic Park? Even something like Birdman? 




 For you. 




 Seriously dude?? 




 Not really 




 Some guy with a broken leg watches other people out of his window

 Don't generalize all of our food when you see places like McDonalds or KFC - try to find some nice, local restaurants, as a lot of them are very good. 




 I've got an amazing cable access show and I still know how to party! 




 Well, he's still aging every year  




 You mean movies that you've seen this year? 




 What's so special about the frame rate/editing compared to any of the other big budget action movies? 




 Well, no offense, but don't talk about it like its some low-budget spiritual piece of filmmaking. Don't get me wrong, it was great, but there really wasn't *that* much there in terms of story or character development. 




 Exactly - it's not about how it was made, it's about what you see on the screen. If that doesn't stand out in any way, then there's no point. 




 ok I'll be quiet 




 It made 100 million dollars this weekend. Not exactly tanking. 




 Saw **The Bridge on the River Kwai** for the first time. Loved it. 

It almost felt like the precursor to Lawrence of Arabia, such a large-scale story told beautifully.

 Oh my gosh! I was wrong 




 Sorry, got confused 




 I disagree - I really don't think anyone could've done as good of an Alec Guiness impression 




 No, I think it was shot on Arri Alexa digital cameras 




 Honestly I think James Franco could play that role pretty well 




 Seriously, why wouldn't it? It's a big budget Hollywood movie based off an already existing franchise with big names as stars. It had a decently large advertising campaign, and it's been doing incredibly well with critics. 




 I've been starvin' 'em, tazin' 'em, singing off key... 




 Can I play the piano anymore? 




 The movie will also spread through the massive ad campaign. Trust me, you guys are talking about this like its a low budget indie movie based on a completely original idea. 




 Yup 




 Sounds like it could be cool - more of a "Close Encounters" approach 




 For example, I've always wanted to see what Stanley Kubrick could've done with Lord of the Rings, or even 1984.

What movies do you wish a director had made? 




 That is all. 




 On a Thursday? Not really. Wait till the weekend is over. 




 Yeah, but that doesn't really make much sense

 Star Wars Sequel Trilogy - I *need* to know what happens! 




 Yeah, I watched The Godfather this week and it was utterly horrible compared to Kung Fury

Edit: (/uj) I actually forgot I was browsing /r/moviescirclejerk for a moment and I thought this was an actual /r/movies thread (/rj) 




 It's stupid to say something is unfairly judged by critics. That's why they are critics, is because they are qualified to be judging something. If the unanimous decision of the critics is that the movie is bad, then it might be true for a lot of people. 




 Alfred Molina IIRC - Satipo (Indiana Jones), Doc Ock, and some Prince of Persia character  




 Well, that's in terms of box office, not toy, book, and video game sales. 




 I have no idea why you would make a statement that's obviously going to provoke an argument. 




 So we're all neckbeards because we disagree with your opinion, which basically no one else has. 

Logic = A+ 




 I think the conversation was started in the mid-80s, with Gremlins and Temple of Doom. This was tame enough for the time, I guess. 




 Yeah, but not as good as Jaws, unfortunately 




 There was nothing groundbreaking or special about Avatar other than the special effects, which are now commonplace in today's movies. I can't see any Avatar sequels making anywhere near the amount of money that the first one made.

However, Star Wars may be the most popular and successful movie franchise of all time. Like you said, its appeal spans multiple generations all across the globe, and a sequel 10 years in the making is not something that no one cares about. 88 *million* was the number of views that second trailer had in *24 hours*. That's amazing. There is no doubt in my mind that its success will be equal to that of Avatar's. 




 Boring, art house, and foreign all sort of imply pretentious in the context you use it in... 




 http://imgur.com/HfO0EL3

Always loved this scene 




 Guaranteed 1 billion, likely 2, and if it's really really good, I can maybe see it passing Avatar as the highest grossing movie of all time. 




 *The Godfather* - not pretentious or foreign, it is just one of the best written and well told stories.

*Citizen Kane* - most of the cinematography, lighting, makeup, and storytelling techniques you see today? Citizen Kane invented those. 

*The Empire Strikes Back* - nothing pretentious there. Just a good, fun movie. 




 To be honest, there wasn't that much explicitly wrong with it. Sure, the acting was bland and it could be dull at times, but it did its job as a disaster movie. It had the right blend of characters and action. 




 I elaborated on my point. You answered the question saying everyone hates Star Wars when you like it, but that's objectively not true. 




 Well, not really unknown with a few million subs 




 That was Sjin! 




 Think about how much hype that created. No way to see it online easily, and there hadn't been a Star Wars movie in 16 years. 




 No, they're really not. No one hates Star Wars. It's one of the most universally adored and most popular franchises. 




 **The World is Not Enough**

C'mon. It's a cool spy action movie. What's not to love? 




 Well, technically it was produced in Britain with some of their money... So... 




 Eh, more like an SNL sketch, not a feature length movie 




 The Godfather 




 The Elephant Man

Spartacus

The Godfather Part III 




 It was filmed there.

What makes 2001 British? 




 He does use the same quality and techniques for effects 




 I would think that

Kylo Ren = Darth Vader

Snoke = The Emperor

Gleeson's character = Tarkin

Captain Phasma = Boba Fett  




 I would think OP means from the two teasers 




 I think they've confirmed that was pulled from the film - if anyone could back me up on that, that would be great 




 My friends and I played the most intense game of Clue ever. 




 MICHAEL! 




 It just goes to show that, no matter what you say about the quality of those movies, George Lucas new something about marketing 




 - Have seen movie
- Has read book

A few things that make the movie so great in my opinion:

Kubrick's direction

Nicholson's acting

Cinematography

Visuals

Suspense and fear

Though very different from the book, The Shining is a good film on its own 




 Wayne's World. Uh, excellent! 




 Written for the movie... So... 









 I would think "realistic looking computer graphics" fits better 




 Mad Marx: Commie Road

ayy lmao 




 Star Wars, 2001, Jurassic Park, Jaws 




 A few bad names =/= bad story, bad acting, bad directing, or bad visuals. Wait till the movie comes out. He won't ruin it.

 I wouldn't say horrible quality, Apple does make quality designed hardware and software that works for most average people.

 No, but it would be a more gradual decline to insanity, and I think he can do the whole "intimidating but strangely calm" thing 




 I've always wondered how to see google searches from previous years, thanks! 




 That's why I think Harrison Ford could've worked well in that role 




 Me neither - I think it was only with the IMAX 3D version 




 It might be in IMAX theaters as well 




 Always wondered this. I know there were a countless number of times when Lucas said no, but were there ever rumors in the 2000s of another movie happening?  




 Star Wars - Episode 3: Divisions of the [Quagmire](http://imgur.com/YFRz1l3) 




 The Clone Wars seemed like it could be a title for one of them 




 Yeah, there's really not much about those that couldn't be canon 




 I have 3/5, Droids, Clone Wars Volume 1, and the Ewoks movie. Only the Clone Wars, and maybe Droids, are recommended. 




 I wondered if I should put it on, and I almost left it out, but there are some people out there who seem to like it... 




 Personally I love Last Crusade the best.

What do you think? 




 I honestly don't know how I feel. There were as many good moments for me as there were bad. Firstly, I loved the style overall. It had a very Disney-ish feel to it, which helped to bring a sense of wonder and adventure to it. On the other hand, it was probably one of the most cliche movies I've ever seen, and the dialogue was not anything to be proud of. 




  That's another small step for man, an even greater leap for mankind 




 The Bridge on the River Kwai 




 Haha - I think people are on to you 




 There has never been a time where reading/hearing/seeing Karl hasn't made me laugh out loud 




 Inspired by /u/JG1991's question 




 Yeah, I actually think it's the closest in style and tone to the OT 




 Or the multiple of 2? 




 Then I don't think you understand what makes Star Wars so good and successful. It's a timeless story with relatable characters, something that a lot of movies in the 70s didn't have. Without it's special effects and wide appeal, we wouldn't have any of the blockbuster movies today.  




 C'mon dude! 




 Yeah, I've never understood why that would make it look any better  




 I agree with you on everything except George Miller emulating the style of Buster Keaton. Not in the slightest. Action-comedy is not what I'd call Mad Max. 




 Life, um, finds a way... 




 I think it would be *interesting* (not necessarily good) to see a sequel where all the classic animated characters are struggling in a world where CGI has taken over  




 Use a YouTube to MP3 downloader for the trailer and cut out that one line 




 So you'd rather pay extra for something you can accomplish in an easier way? 




  Iron Man

Comic hero 




  James Bond

Book character 




 Not OP, but I thought it was nothing but a typical action movie. Very little was there in terms of story or dialogue. 




 And it was really only Lucas himself that he saw potential in, not necessarily the movie. 




 :/ 




 I'm sure they would if a popular/critically acclaimed director were to do it - someone like Spielberg or Nolan (not to be circlejerky or anything) 




 Personally, I think those movies have lots of redeeming qualities. Special effects are nice, the whole "world building" is cool, Ewan McGregor and Liam Neeson give good performances, and it was interesting to see what was going on in the Star Wars universe before the OT. 




 It already sort of is, and it's only been out for a little more than a week - I don't think there's anything to worry about  




 See:

Conquest of the Planet of the Apes 




 "Sorry, meant to say that" 




 "Yes" 




 Well, you can't call something overrated just because there's parts about it that you don't like... 




 "I really hate the fact that you made me waste the time typing letters into a search engine so I could figure out what you were talking about. I could've used that time to do a lot of other things. I appreciate your comment, but FYI, please try not to ruin my day again."

 Never seen it actually - the correct answer is Star Wars V 




 You should watch the documentary "Behind the Planet of the Apes" if you haven't seen it  




 No, it was Empire Strikes Back 




 No 




 Nope 




 Nope 




 Got it! 




 Here's 5:

1) ...
2) Planet of the Apes
3) Back to the Future
4) Jurassic Park
5) Jaws 




 Yeah, I figured, but you said *a* Bush, and not just Bush 




 Well, no matter what you say, it has undeniably had a humongous impact on popular culture and filmmaking as a whole. 




 They are still quality pieces of hardware and software  
























 I was just jokin' around dude, didn't mean for you to take it seriously. 




 Yup 




 It's pronounced Barometer, Jerry!

(I know it's the other way around) 




 Everyone has their own preferences.... 




 It won't. IIRC, Interstellar was filmed in 70mm, and it looked fine. 




 A /s might help communicate your point a little better, but it's still not hilariously funny.  




 It's *not* Star Wars The Force Awakens? 




 Huh, I had no idea. 




 Not ID Forever Part I? 




 Larry David never fails to make me laugh 




 I usually do Plinkett, then the 101 Wacky Jokes for Kids to prove that Plinkett's voice isn't actually like that, then Half in the Bag 




 I would think it was because it might cause confusion among people who saw Luke lose his blue lightsaber 




 DAE I know what u talking about rlm rite??????????????????? ayy lmao 




 I guess they didn't color it right for the trailer 




 It seems like Star Wars and Marvel are being saved for D23, and that's only a month later.  




 It's the percent of critics that liked it, not the actual rating of the film. I have no idea why Sharknado is at 82%, but you shouldn't say critics opinions are irrelevant because of it. 




 ? 




 Not his question.

 I wouldn't think so... 




 Darth Plagueis was Palpatine's master, as mentioned in Episode 3 




 Yes, because YouTube was so popular and different in the two years that it was around before Google bought it?

Google has owned YouTube for 9 years, a pretty significant portion of its lifetime. Not much has changed to drastically alter your viewing experience.

And by the way, it's not Googles fault for having to follow the law and take down clips that movie studios don't want on YouTube... 









 Notice anything...?

 I honestly felt that it was closest in style and tone to the OT. 




 Spielberg makes movies like that for any age - legitimately great storytelling 




 Mm... Maybe not as talked about in today's world, but by no means underrated. Fantastic reviews, good box office results, several Oscar nominations... 




 Steven Spielberg 









 Conquest of the Planet of the Apes (has a 6.1, but close enough!) I think that this is a legitimately good movie, with some good performances and underlying messages. 




 Each to his own, I guess, but no reason to call me a dweebo. I like Star Trek just as much, just so you know. 




 That's *Caitlyn* Fett now 




 Yeah 




 No, this is a well known fact that's true 




 I would agree, if it wasn't for movies like Birdman and The Grand Budapest Hotel 




 I wouldn't say boring. Maybe emotionless, but they looked cool  (IMO) 




 Sure they have a lot in common, but no one should try to point out which one is better than the other, cause there's really not an answer to that. 




 Missed a couple of lines there! 




 Met Jar Jar and Boss Nass... 




 They locked the door and tried to kill us 




 Star Wars all the way  




 Yup, all those hundreds of millions of dweebos. Complete idiots for liking a simple story with fun ideas and relatable characters. Morons.

/s 




 But it's almost like comparing boats and cars. One might be used more often, and they're both methods of transportation but they're used for two different things. 




 Alright, I guess I agree with that. 




 Well, it's kind of an obscure movie to put fake casting details on, especially ones that seem realistic. 




 I disagree. I don't think Star Wars is only an action movie, it has a lot of relatable human elements and themes, and is genuinely a well told story. 

Wars and Trek are about two different things, and I really don't think it's right to compare them. 




 No. No one does that. Crazy people do that. 




 That's gold, Jerry, GOLD! 




 Not just to me, but to many critics and movie goers alike. Look at the AFI top 100 movies, or the best movies on Rotten Tomatoes, or most critic's choices for the best movies of all time, and you'll see that Citizen Kane is high up on that list. 




 It's an absolute to you, but not to the majority of people who think it is the best movie of all time.  




 I suggest you watch The Godfather Part II. It's a more interesting/faster paced story, and it reveals more about Michael and Vito as characters. 




 But so many things *about* it shaped what came *after* it. It changed the industry as a whole, which is a very hard thing to do. 




 When did I say that? 




 Give me an example. 




 Because it's a practically perfect story, that's fantastically well written, with some of the best acting of all time. Very few flaws, if any.

 




 ... About what? 




 Yeah, but if you really want to know why it's considered the best movie of all time, watching it would help you understand what people are talking about.  




 Every moment you might think is cliche or overused? Citizen Kane started that. Appreciate it for what it is, and realize that modern filmmaking wouldn't be anywhere close to what it is today without that movie. 




 Everest? Macbeth? 




 Macbeth! Steve Jobs! Prometheus 2! X-Men Apocalypse! 




 This is actually the THIRD installment in the critically acclaimed Birds series!

http://m.imdb.com/title/tt0109275/ 




 Huh. I actually think Ewan McGregor could've been a good Bond 




 What? Like the original *didn't* have young children playing an important role in the movie? 









 Radio Bart will always hold a special place in my heart. Marge in Chains and Treehouse of Horror V are close behind, though. 




 Well, would you rather have a medium amount of good pizza, or all you can eat of pretty good pizza? 




 Too bad it's a true story.  




 Jurassic Park - Always amazing

Lost World - Liked it

JPIII - Bad, but entertaining and fun  




 What are you doing on this sub if you don't like their jokes? 

And by the way, you made a suggestion, and multiple people pointed out why it won't happen. No use arguing it.

 Dude, it's coming out years from now. I'm sure the script is still being worked on. No updates does not automatically mean it has been cancelled. 




 No 




 I would think its the writers more than the director  




 Wrath of Kahn? The Voyage Home? 




 I know what you mean, but pirates seem to smell lol chlorine to me 




 Agreed 




 Chlorine  




 It created a lot of the modern cinematography, lighting, makeup, and storytelling techniques that are commonplace today.

http://www.slate.com/articles/life/ft/2011/05/the_mark_of_kane.html 




 Not just revolutionizing film at its time, but film as a medium in general. So much of TDK would be different if Citizen Kane didn't exist, and the same goes for every other modern movie. 




 No - episode vii this year, episode viii in 2017, and episode IX in 2019 




 Yeah, but Mike Stoklasa isn't anywhere near as well known as those guys 




 What? 




 Last Star Wars film in 2017? No way Jose! You still have Anthology 2 in 2018 and Episode IX in 2019, and I doubt Disney will stop there! 




 Maybe, maybe... 




 /u/trollabot test_subject3827 




 Yeah - above *Citizen Kane?* 




 Ah okay 
























 Probably March, too - there's really not much coming out in those months that's big enough to beat Star Wars 




 He said no because he was concerned over how big of a deal it was, and that he was unsure if he wanted to risk making a bad movie and disappointing everyone.

Abrams is a lifelong Star Wars fan, I doubt he would turn that down because it took up too much time. 




 That Luke one was released yesterday, and it is a very obvious fake from that picture of Mark Hamill with his beard. Reverse the "leaked image," and put it next to the Hamill one. 




 Nope, that's gonna be Rogue One - why else would they choose to not have Marvel at a *comic* convention and put Star Wars instead? Something big is coming. 




 Yeah :( 




 Seriously?? Where? 




 Cleaned it up a little... Not my best work, but good enough

http://imgur.com/nr7IoHa 




 Most likely from trailer 3 




 In reality, all this does is create more hype for the movie. Two screenshots that give away very little information won't make that much of a difference to them. 




 It does to the countless number of people who do care about star wars 




 No, I followed, but I have my facts, and you have your wrong opinions. That's okay. 




 Mad Max, Interstellar... 




 Too bad Star Wars is gonna be there :) 




 You know what, I don't even know why I bother.

http://imgur.com/zlyH2VQ 




 You have absolutely no idea what has happened in the 30 year gap between the films.

Also, what's with you using the term "mulatto?" I forget, are we living in racially segregated Alabama in the 1960s or is this 2015? 




 THERE ARE OTHER JEDIS IN THE UNIVERSE.  




 Well, you proved me wrong. I really appreciate you taking the time to find that direct quote and showing me how you were right this whole time.

:/ 




 Why not? Give me facts. Give me a quote from someone that definitively says that, "Finn is not a Jedi." Has the movie come out yet? No. Have you seen the movie? No. You have literally no way of knowing any of this. 




 Looks pretty shopped to me 




 To keep it interesting, to change things up, to make the story better, to give new and talented actors a chance to try things, to challenge the assumptions that people have about who is who, etc. Pretty simple. 




 http://imgur.com/Zqiz8jR

You see that? That was art of Finn's costume officially shown at the official Star Wars celebration. What's that in his pocket? A lightsaber. They were *very* deliberate in what they chose to show, so there's absolutely no way that that's not a hint of some kind. 




 Exactly how I like to look at it - or decades! Only 1/20th of a decade until it comes out! 




 TL;DR - Literally nothing. 




 Well, it is actually. It's like calling Pulp Fiction a cult classic, when it's really well known, critically acclaimed, and pretty successful. 




 I think you might be one of the only people with that opinion, no offense. 




 It made enough money to qualify as successful and it got good reviews. Not exactly overshadowed. 




  fucking condescension 

A lot more condescending than what OP said. Besides, why would you need someone to prove you wrong on an opinion? Isn't that what opinions are for? 




 It has nothing to do with how good/bad of an adaptation it is, it's just a poorly written, somewhat badly acted movie. It's just not good filmmaking. 




 It's incredibly well directed. Stanley Kubrick is pretty much known for being able to direct things well. 




 We're only 6 months away from the release of Star Wars The Force Awakens! 




 Foxcatcher? 




 I don't have a picture of the page, but this is the figure:

http://imgur.com/JjaIQgS 




 It has a waaayy better lineup of first party games, and it had a lot more innovative features, no matter what you say about their quality.  




 http://imgur.com/fcG4W5A

Not on the page it was originally posted to 




 The comment said "I can't wait for 9/11" (when Mario maker comes out), but that could be confused to mean something else  




 Just because the consoles don't sell well, doesn't mean they're bad. The Wii U is a fantastic piece of hardware, and I would take it any day over an XBone or PS4 




 I guess this is confirmation that it's real  




 What's wrong with Spielbergian? If anything I'd take that as a complement... 




 Me too :( 




 Nope, not really. Alec Guiness does not lose any of our respect after his death. 




 You still refer to King George III as King George III, even though he's dead. 




 Tarantino has nowhere near as wide of an appeal 




 Not on the same scale as Star Wars or Jurassic World or The Avengers 




 Well, I thought so. But, y'know, sarcasm is a little hard to communicate over the interwebs. A /s might help. 




 I hope that's sarcasm 




 I doubt Daisy Ridley will, but maybe John Boyega 




 He backed himself into a corner there didn't he 




 Or you could just eat one piece at a time with your hands 




 That's a little excessive. What if someone told you they didn't like the way you talked, so they just cover their ears when you open your mouth? It's stupid, and doesn't really make much sense. 




 No, I wouldn't mind having more Star Wars trilogies - it's just that you spew a constant stream of BS. 




 Can you stop? 




 Yeah, I've seen most of those - now that I think about it, Dr. Strangelove would probably work pretty well. Thanks! 




 Yeah, that's one of the ones I was thinking of. 




 Ok 




 Today was really disappointing. 




 Watch some of their other stuff. Trust me, this was their worst review in a while. 














 July 10th, when we'll most likely get it, is less than a month away - that's not far off!

 It's a rare phenomenon, that has occurred a few times in the past few months, most notably at the release of Star Wars 7 Teaser 2, Fallout 4 announcement, and Fallout 4 release date confirmation. It is expected to happen again at the gathering known as "San Diego Comic Con," where new and exciting information about games and movies alike will be unveiled.

 You're entitled to your opinion, but that doesn't mean that everyone else's is wrong. If the general public likes something that you  don't, it's probably something that makes a lot of people happy and something that they can enjoy.

I think that might be an extra blaster on the side. 




 I need no sympathy 




 Could be... Looks pretty legit

http://imgur.com/Hx9Ei7c 




 Well, I think it has a lot of redeeming qualities. It's certainly a competently made movie, and Steven Spielberg almost never fails to make an enjoyable/watchable film. I like how it mirrors a 50s sci-fi b-movie, which is a different take on what the Indiana Jones series usually is. 




 No, didn't say you ruined my day. I was just saying you were making unnecessarily rude comments to those who thought there was no reason to make a post like the one you did... 




 Well, he's a competent filmmaker, and he wanted to do it. Being friends with Spielberg was only an added benefit, I'm sure. 




 Here you go. These are just the first few that I thought of. Don't go with the assumption that every pre-1960 movie is a wacky Three Stooges-esque screwball comedy
 
Citizen Kane
Casablanca 
Paths of Glory
Ben-Hur
The Bridge on the River Kwai
The Wizard of Oz
Singin' in the Rain
12 Angry Men
Gone with the Wind
It's a Wonderful Life
Rear Window
North by Northwest
Vertigo
Metropolis
Seven Samurai
Anatomy of a Murder
Some Like it Hot
On the Waterfront
Mr. Smith Goes to Washington
Snow White and the Seven Dwarves


 




 Oh I'm sorry we're all being such babies complaining about how you posted useless speculation regarding a movie you've seen *3 times* in 4 weeks. 




 Yeah, but you ask the question like most movies from pre-1960 are like that, which is not true.
 




 The Man Who Knew Too Much 




 No... That's not true! THATS IMPOSSIBLE! 




 Thats *your,* idiot 




 That's a bit of a stretch. 

Almost like saying, "Harrison Ford in plane crash = foreshadowing Han's death," or "Peter Mayhew old = Chewbacca dies" 




 No, Riggan also directed and wrote the adaptation of the play 




 "What pre-1960 film is still watchable?" What kind of question is that? Which ones *wouldn't* be watchable? 




 God I know - I don't know if my body will be able to handle it  




 Good point 




 Seems a little more believable than most of the stuff on here 




 So, all the millions of people that like Star Wars are neckbeards? And you expect not to get negative comments from people who disagree with your unpopular opinion? 




 Yeah - Rogue One is December 16th, 2016 and I think Episode 8 is May 26th 2017 - Anthology 2 is confirmed for 2018, and Episode 9 for 2019 




 By David Lean? On every level, David Lean's movies are almost perfect. Have you ever seen The Bridge on the River Kwai, or Lawrence of Arabia, or Doctor Zhivago? Replace that with Middle Earth. 




 Imagine how great a David Lean Star Wars or LotR movie would've been... 




 No - Netflix usually puts complete seasons of shows months after they air  




 What? Nimoy, Lee, and Brooks? I certainly hope not. I don't know if I'd be able to live with myself anymore :( 




 Shows from most major networks the next day? That's pretty good if you ask me. 




 I'm sure that's what's coming. 




 It could be a really cool comic  




 And Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation will have come out by August, so I would think Star Wars at D23 will be Rogue One 




 Episode 7 was printed on all the signs outside the studio in England and on the crew member clothing  




 Well, it's not up to the general audience and JJ Abrams to decide what's canon - the books are, and there's nothing you can do about it. It doesn't matter who cares about it, it's up to the people at the Lucasfilm Story Group. 




 I guess they don't want to spoil anything - it could mean bad reviews, but you never know.

The fan reaction has been pretty much positive though. It supposed to be the best of the sequels by far, and I can't imagine that there's anything explicitly wrong with it to make it *bad*. 




 Oh gawd it seems so far... 




 No I totally understand  
























 And IIRC they said in an episode of Good Morning America after the trailer came out that the planet seen *was* Tatooine... 




 Reported. 




 Jon! 




 Cause there is no actual info about it I just want to know

(see, no shitpost) 




 Thanks 




 What's the science behind that? 









 Most/all of the deleted scenes are on YouTube as well 




 That scene in The Office where David Brent is getting ready for an interview and he rubs the perfume sample off a magazine onto his face. 




 My god, you were right! 




 Citizen Kane (1941) - Often looked at as one of the best and most influential movies of all time.

The Star Wars Original Trilogy (1977, 1980, 1983) - Enjoyable, emotional, action packed sci-fi movies with some revolutionary special effects.

Jaws (1975) - Well written, well directed, well acted. One of the best movies of all time.

Jurassic Park (1993) - Dinosaurs!!

Singin' in the Rain (1952) - Hilarious and well performed. Something there for everybody. 




 [The Shining](http://youtu.be/TgCejsyS0t8) 




 Good point 




 I don't see any reason why they would change that 




 I think Pixar could make an excellent movie from that 




 A 2D animated Star Fox show, in the style of either classic Hanna Barbera cartoons or Genndy Tartakovsky 




 The only thing that makes some sense is the release date  




 Yeah, that would probably sound better 




  the female 




 I don't wanna fall into the circlejerk, but Transformers is badly directed, badly acted, and overall badly made, while Mad Max is able to do most of those things well. 




 Because one does it better 




 Nintendo made a mistake mentioning this so early. It's not coming for a *while,* and people are talking about it like it's right around the corner. There are plenty of Wii U games that are yet to come. 




 Yeah, having the whole series on iTunes would be a big deal - it's the perfect compromise between Hulu and the DVD set, really. 




 I thought it was hilarious - no where near as good as 1, but it was perfectly fine 




 Ah, I play it where $75 is placed in "the pot" at the beginning of the game and only payments like taxes go in.  




 But it was in the official Star Wars magazine - you don't think that's a little weird? 




 Step 1 was 6 years ago? To be honest, I think The Love Guru kind of ruined the chance of him having a starring role anytime soon. 









 Mike Myers 




 Was the highest grossing movie ever until Star Wars... 




 You're still paying money for it...

Move along 




 Yeah, that makes a lot more sense than spending $40 on one now instead of waiting 2 months and buying a full set for the same price... 




 Depends on the price, I might get one. 




 Cable television costs money if I remember correctly... 




 I'm familiar with it 




 I think the prequels (at least Episode 3) are worth watching for some cool sequences, and if you're interested in the back story. 




 Sure 




 I mean for actual effects specifically, not buildings and cars - a battle with lots of robots and laser beams would work better with CGI, like in the Avengers, but I'm not suggesting that it should be 100% blue screened. 




 I'm not trying to get you angry, but this was just a pointless post. 




 I'm not trolling - not trying to be mean, but this isn't really news to anyone. 




 Well Peter Jackson and Steven Spielberg with The Adventures of Tintin 




 Please, don't talk about it like its some low-budget risky indie flick. It's basically guaranteed to make money, and a sequel will come no matter what.  




 Yes  




 Well I guess that's not taking into account the hundreds of millions of dollars it made... 




 Why? 




 Really? There are so many places where CGI works better *and* looks better than practical effects.  




 Yeah, but now it exists and people use it often. Your point? 




 Not necessarily. 




 Totally - people talk about it like its some revolutionary masterpiece, but other than a few good performances and action sequences, there's nothing that makes it stand out. 




 It's a test image that was left in the background of a few frames. Really unnoticeable, but look it up. 




 I didn't mean to imply that he should go and create a new show, I meant the characters in his style would be interesting to see. 




 Probably  




 Let me guess - Mad Max, Interstellar, The Avengers, Inception... 




 The Dark Knight - there are *definitely* movies that deserve a stop ahead of it, like Citizen Kane, Vertigo, Lawrence of Arabia. I don't think it's a bad film, but it's not anywhere near a 9 in my book.  




 I wouldn't - I know I can get it cheaper elsewhere  




 Yeah, I wouldn't, just the idea of getting one came to my mind after hearing about that. 




 Now that GameStop has retro consoles for sale, which one is worth getting? There are an equal number of games I would wanna play on both the N64 and the GameCube, but which one would I get the most enjoyment out of? Which one will I want to play more?

I'd love some help with this! 




 Hasn't this been news for a while? I know the Open Road thing is recent info, but the title is kind of misleading. 




 Why would you share it? 




 Not always  




 Yes, but *a* lead. 




 Goud points you making!!?!/11one 




 Sure - but people seem to have this idea that a movie (Mad Max, Terminator) can't possibly be as good if it's rated PG-13 




 And the car... 




 ToddH 




 Black and white???? Srsly? They had color why didn't use it!?? My film studies teecher saiys that it best movie all time, idk what talking Bout.

Prove my right??!?? 




 Nah... 




 The Empire Strikes Back 




 Yeah, I've never understood this - if the movie doesn't have R-rated content, then what's the point in rating it R? The movie is made before the rating is given, so it's not like it would drastically change any of the material. 




 Pigs in a blanket? 




 MEIN FURHER! I CAN WALK! 




 This isn't a poster, it's promotional material - we know for a fact Finn is a main character  




 No, that was from official leaked merchandise around the time of the second trailer. This picture is also from the official Russian Star Wars website. 




 Watch some of the behind the scenes videos of the prequels. True effort is put into making them good movies. All of the cast and crew (minus Rick McCallum and George Lucas) are really trying their hardest to bring back the magic of Star Wars. Seriously, most of the CGI holds up well today, some genuinely good performances are given by McGregor and McDarmid, and there really are a lot of good scenes to be found. That's enough redemption for me. 




 When people compare a movie to other films or its sequels.

Like saying, "The Godfather 3 sucks because it's not as good as the first 2." Who cares? Can't you just judge a movie as its own work?  




 Yeah, that post also linked to the Fox Home Entertainment page... What were they expecting? 




 ... Which is exactly how Obi Wan acted in the OT...

Also, stop pretending that the prequels are the worst thing ever. They have their flaws, but they are, by no means, horrible movies. They have redeeming qualities, and you need to look for those. 




 I can see where you're coming from, definitely - I personally hate the dark and gritty Nolan Batman, and I prefer the campy and fun Batman.  




 People have not been understanding what minimalism is lately... 




 Charlie Chaplin and morbid are not two words I would ever associate 




 Well, it has very little/ a very straightforward plot. Not much there to interpret. 




 Exclusively Hulu 




 Me too - I can't wait! 




 He's entitled to his opinions. 




 In this day and age? All of them. 




 Right, but Marvel and Pirates are not Star Wars - I think Disney would rather put out an official trailer than have tons of low-quality recordings leak. 




 Yeah, but it's like posting a recipe for brownies on a subreddit about corruption in the sugar industry. Sure, they're sorta related, but it doesn't really have to do with the overall topic. 




 No, I'd say in September, when they release all the toys and books and everything. I would also imagine that they'd release a comic con trailer to the public. 




 Lawrence of Arabia, 2001, Star Wars, Jurassic Park, The Bridge on the River Kwai 




 I'd say at San Diego Comic Con, on July 10th

http://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-the-force-awakens-more-coming-to-san-diego-comic-con-2015 




 Not your favorite movies, but the ones you think influenced the filmmaking industry, or are perfectly told stories. 

Here's my list:

1. The Godfather
2. Citizen Kane
3. 2001: A Space Odyssey 
4. Vertigo
5. Lawrence of Arabia
6. Doctor Strangelove
7. Gone With the Wind 
8. Back to the Future
9. The Empire Strikes Back 
10. The Wizard of Oz  




 Batman and *freaking* Robin?? Whoa, dude. 




 Nothing changed - If the majority of professional movie critics don't like a movie, it's probably safe to make the assumption that most people think that movie is not good. Just because you have a different opinion, it doesn't mean that everyone else's is wrong or invalid. 




 What about a few reviews of actual critics? If  they all say a movie is good/bad, I think it's generally safe to assume that that is true. 




 Those are bad things...? 




 So you wouldn't call The Godfather or 2001 classics? 




 Why not? 




 True, but who does it better? 




 Don't just assume that mobile = bad. 




 Well, other than the characters, the setting, the general story, the ideas and messages, etc. 




 KAAAANNNNNEEEE!!!!! 




 Not trying to tell you that you should like it, everyone's entitled to their opinions, but that's sorta the point -

It's basically a piece of cinematic "art." I know it sounds pretentious or whatever, but you're supposed to interpret it how *you* want to interpret it. There's not gonna be an explanation, because it's up to you to explain it to yourself, if that makes sense. 




 I remember this being put as one of the possible formats for teaser 2... 




 And 3 feature films... 




 Seriously?

Both of those exist as movies. 




 Rendezvous with Rama 




 Why isn't he allowed to have his own preferences? Why does that make him ignorant for not being interested in something?

 Wait it wasn't?  
























 TBH, I always thought that TPM was the most "Star Warsy" out of any of the prequels, in terms of setting, design, style, and tone. 




 JJ said he doesn't like it when movies do that - and I get that that's basically all that the Star Trek reboots were, but keep in mind that he A) didn't write those, B) had less creative control over those, and C) was never a big Trek fan.

Kasdan and Abrams are both competent writers, and I'm confident they know which direction to take the story in. 

We also have Kathleen Kennedy, who does her job of producer very well. We have an excellent cast, and I'm sure every other aspect of the movie is in very capable hands. 




 Wait, *Roger Christian* directed that? Famed creator of Black Angel (soon to be adapted into a feature film), and set decorator on A New Hope? Seriously? 




 The two trailers we've seen? The great director, screenwriters, and producers? The great cast? The possibility of being able to redeem the Star Wars franchise? 




 I know :( 




 So does the Empire's logo if you think about it..

 By September, the amount of hype will be the same if not more than TPM 




 Even earlier, possibly 




 Look through his comment history 




 Not according to the official synopsis of the movie released by Lucasfilm... 




 Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate....

 




 Eh, I don't think Universal and Spielberg would have much of a problem with it having a *cameo* (R2 did in Star Trek), but I think that would be a little stupid having it as a main character. 









 Back to the Future

The Empire Strikes Back

Aliens 




 Totally different style, characters, and ideas. Empire had meaning behind it, and was well written, while Trek was really just a cool action movie with a good cast. 




 Sorry to disappoint you, but Rogue One isn't a Rogue Squadron movie. Instead, it's about the group of Rebels that stole the Death Star plans in between RotS and ANH 




 16th 




 Why? That's a weird assumption to make off a pretty vague title. 




 Something tells me that little references like that will be scattered all over the new movies 









 Exactly - he enjoys it, and that's all it is. I *enjoy* eating a donut, but if I hear that there is some scandal involving the management at my local donut shop, I don't immediately go and interfere with people I don't know, have no emotional connection to, or really don't affect the quality of my donut. 




 Aww man it's like banana bread but better!

 General Grevious, probably 




 Super Mario Brothers. 

Oh wait that happened and it sucked. 




 I agree - this is the problem I have with movies like Man of Steel and Skyfall, not saying those were bad movies, but Superman and James Bond aren't really dark characters. 




 Yeah, definitely next friday 




 I'd love to try it 




 Honestly? I'll I care about is being able to get the same content. 




 Is this the end of reddit as we know it? Or will this all be forgotten about within a week? 




 Other than Star Wars, there's Bridge of Spies, Macbeth, Steve Jobs, The Good Dinosaur, The Revenant, Spectre, Creed, The Martian, Mission Impossible 5, and a lot more that I can't remember. 




 Im sure everything will be back to normal within the next week
 




 I agree 




 Episode VI wasn't directed by Lucas either  




 It wasn't GL who decided that, it was Disney 




 Star Wars - Episode VII: The Force Awakens

Star Wars - Episode VIII: An Ancient Fear

Star Wars - Episode IX: Rise of the Republic

Had a little trouble with the last one, as we really have no idea of where the series is going. 




 Hmm... Something tells me they wouldn't use any words that they've already used in previous titles, e.g. "New," "Sith" 




 You know what I find particularly ridiculous? Is that incredibly small subs, some with as little as 30 members, are shutting down. They have very little, if not nothing to do with this. It's a problem that should be left to the people involved, and maybe the major default subs. Why should the people who don't know what's going on be permitted from enjoying content on subs they want to be on? 




 That actually sounds pretty cool... 




 Fuck you Rick Berman!

All jokes aside though, I just think there's this thing in movies today where movies with dark tones generally have darker colors. The Empire Strikes Back is the perfect example of having a dark movie, but still being able to have a vibrant color pallet. This kind of makes TDK look a little dull.

I get that they're good performances, but the character of Bruce Wayne has very little emotional depth. He's a shallow character, and his intentions can be very easily understood. Same goes for Alfred. 




 I see what you're saying 









 y 




 NX really needs to appeal to the Xbox and Playstation market - it has to have a proper controller, like the Wii U Pro, good third party support right from the start, and the specs of any other competing console. 




 Or the Nintendo Wiii 




 Seriously? You ask the question like its gonna be hard to find good movies from that time period.

Star Wars Trilogy

Jaws

The Godfather I and II

Alien

Rocky

Blade Runner

Apocalypse Now

Back to the Future

The Shining

Indiana Jones Trilogy

The Sting

Amadeus

Taxi Driver

The Elephant Man

Monty Python and the Holy Grail

 




 It's in the rules 




 Can't ask stuff like that dude. Could get banned. 




 Yea 




 The Star Wars fan base includes millions of people over the globe man - pretty big in terms of size and influence on popular culture 




 To be honest, I'm glad. I would be upset if Michael Keaton (JK Simmons too) only had a few great dramatic roles, and then went right back to stuff like a King Kong prequel. I want more Birdman and Whiplash! 




 Read about it man. I went, and it was incredible. It's not just a film, they've recreated scenes and sets right out of the movies, and everyone is in character. You can trade with people, have food and drink, and go on different quests to find things - if was fantastically well done, and very very fun. A must-go for any Star Wars fan. 




 I don't know what time zone you're in, but it's at 25 right now. 




 Have you seen the episode? It's the same model PEZ dispenser 




 You might be in trouble. Just went from 25 to a 26... 




 There're plenty of PG-13 movies that are the story the director wants to tell. A rating shouldn't automatically mean the movie isn't the best quality. 




 She made the point of how they keep changing the way you play their consoles, with styluses and WiiMotes, and how it goes against what you grew up with and what you loved.

Is she familiar with the idea of time moving forward? Of things changing? Of people innovating and doing something different? 




 It won't happen as a remake, but more likely a sequel or reboot - if anything, I can almost guarantee you that Colin Trevorrow will direct

 [Family Guy's Seinfeld Parody](http://youtu.be/ZPJSJPkpU1s) 




 No problem 




 My personal favorite  




 Serious tag, man. 




 As a reminder, those bills are $1, $2, $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100. 




 But it doesn't need it  




 Stanley Kubrick's Lord of the Rings starring The Beatles 




 *Raiders* of the Lost Ark is the full title 




 Shelley Duvall in The Shining. Not *horrible*, considering Kubrick basically tortured her. 




 It's a toy. And don't start complaining saying Disney is going to ruin Star Wars with stuff like this, because similar merchandise existed way before the purchase of Lucasfilm. 




 Well obviously you haven't seen enough... It's hilarious, with a lot of memorable characters. 




 Look up Magic Leap 




 What do you mean? 




 It's similar to what HoloLens is, the idea of virtually altering your real environment 




 I guess so  




 Seinfeld is not popular? Dude, the series finale had 76 million viewers. That's like a third of the country.  




 I thought I read it was Borat 




 Just curious, but what would be an example of pretentious commentary?  




 Ripley is the better character, no offense.  




 Not when it turned out to be an actual thing - HoloLens, Magic Leap... 




 A DeLorean, Uranium, and a vest 




 There was an episode of the show where Karl essentially invents the concept of Augmented Reality, and both Ricky and Steve say it was the stupidest thing they've ever heard. 




 In the original movie I meant 




 Why? Because there wasn't a constant stream of action and dinosaurs? Because it developed the characters and story? 




 Yeah I guess so. I'm more expecting just a trailer than anything, this was only an idea.

By September, everything will have a "OHMYGOD LOOK ITS STAR WARS" kind of feel, once all the toys and new books and games come out. 




 I saw it in regular IMAX with Tomorrowland and that alone made up for all of the movies flaws 




 Newman!

Known on reddit as jake4545 




 Trust me, they do not. 




 It's not *that* crappy. You can still tell what it's supposed to say... 




 What about that comment above that you have 7 down votes for? 




 Why? 




 Spielberg as potential director maybe? 




 TIL you don't have any common sense in knowing that it is not a reboot 




 Why not? Up and Toy Story 3 did, and I'd argue that Inside Out is just as good as those. 




 Definitely - I think this is Michael Fassbender's Oscar year, whether it's for Steve Jobs or that. 




 Me and Earl and the Dying Girl? Inside Out? 




 Not gonna happen. 




 Buddy you won't find any way to read Star Wars until December. I bet you less than 8 people have actually read the script in its entirety. 




 He might've been the cloud guy? 




 I like them too - what's so wrong with them? 




 Definitely - whatever it is, it's gonna be big news 




 I would think Disney would want a high quality version of a trailer to be released as opposed to 15 low quality leaks. 




 Lenny and Carl 




 Jake fucking Lloyd was in the background at 26:59 waving his arms at the camera. Oh my gaaadddd. 




 How is it a reboot when 6+ characters are returning? And it takes place 30 years after the last movie? And is a sequel? And is referred to as Episode 7? And takes place in the same timeline as the other films?  
























 I messaged the mods earlier about having another bingo game like at Star Wars Celebration - I made a board for it, would you consider it?

http://imgur.com/cJBVoVb 









 I don't think Arndt ever had a full script, just a story treatment 




 But it's relevant to this community. 




 MakingStarWars.net 




 No, a lot of his leaks have been true before. 




 My dad, mostly. He was buying Star Wars toys for me even before I was born. 




 Post it for real so people know it's fake 




 Don't be a jerk about it, man. 




 I agree with you on the Family Guy part, but at least the Simpsons writers try. The show might not seem as good as it used to be, but that's really just because it's changed to cater to a more modern audience. Family Guy is literally just beating dead horses and making pop culture references. 




 Yeah I did that and it worked fine 




 Please /u/00-----00
 




 I know it is, but that doesn't mean a movie couldn't be coming. McGregor has expressed interest multiple times, so I don't know why Disney wouldn't do it. 




 Well, unless there is something else that would "break the Internet" like /u/00-----00 said.
 




 I think we all know the movie is coming by now 




 I think this is pretty realistic. Other than having Gwendolyn Christie and maybe Harrison Ford at SDCC, it's possible that they bring out Ewan McGregor at the end of the panel to announce an Obi-Wan movie. I think this would make up for the absence of a TFA trailer, and they could even show a teaser for the Kenobi movie, similar to what they did with Rogue One at Celebration. 




 They didn't think to mention "teaser," just trailer or clips. 




 Ah. It wont let you use the AR function unless you scan that magazine ad that was leaked yesterday. 




 I think they're saying its going to be on Google Play soon 




 Nothing's been confirmed as of now, but I bet they will. 




 Well, 4.5 of those things we know are true 




 I think it's left to right top, and then right to left bottom. 









 It was so amazing. If someone had asked me to go back the next night I definitely would have. And I probably would have wanted to go back the night after that, too. 




 Any good (Photoshop) tutorials on how to do this? All the ones I find are bad and whenever I try it turns out horrible.  




 Haha you and everyone else 




 At least he can write well - I'm sure the *idea* of the spinoff wasn't his, but the story certainly will be, and that's a good thing. 




 Yeah 




 Kinda sorta, but he would definitely make a better Indy than Han 




 I definitely don't hate him, but he's too old, doesn't look very much like Han, and really doesn't have that same charmingly arrogant quality that Han has, if you get what I mean. 




 Definitely Boba Fett, maybe Lando, and maybe Jabba. I'd love to see why Han has Jabba's bounty on his head. 




 I think anyone with common sense would rather do a Star Wars movie than a Flash movie. If anything, they'll drop out of *that*. 




 If they cast an unknown actor who can actually *act,* then we'll definitely have something to look forward to.

I hope it's not Chris Pratt. 




 But he was by Sean Connery 




 I bet that whoever they cast in this will end up being Indiana Jones as well (but that could never happen, because Indy 5 comes out the same year as this) 




 Taron Egerton, Ryan Gosling 




 Yeah but having two movies without the force (as far as we know) isn't any reason to say the studio hates the idea of the force  




 I'm sure it will be - I don't think they'd do it directly before A New Hope, or else they'd have to cast someone *really* similar looking to Ford 




 Interesting idea - I can imagine Boba would play some role in this 




 The next movie coming out literally has "the force" in the title. 




 And written by Lawrence Kasdan and his son Jon! 




 Odd choice, but they've done good work in the past - Lego Movie, Jump Street, Last Man on Earth 




 Pretty nice, though I wish you had done Nimoy as Spock in place of the "Chewie, we're home" part 




 Why would that ever happen? 




 It's just as easy as baking a cheesecake 




 Mm yes FakingStarWars the most believable news source since The Onion 




 The movie is optional. It's not the worst thing ever, but it's certainly not the best.

The series is great, however. You can either watch it in the order that it was released, or you can watch it in the chronological order: http://m.ign.com/articles/2014/03/18/star-wars-the-clone-wars-how-to-watch-in-the-right-order 




 John Boyega playing a Stormtrooper 




 I would. Star Wars is big, and there's no way this information won't get out to the public. Disney would rather put out a video of the panel in high quality than have a bunch of low quality phone recordings. 




 I think it depends on the studio and the director. I would imagine that JJ Abrams has a lot of control over what's in the Star Wars trailers, while the directors of Marvel movies probably have less input. 




 As much as I love them, there are *many* other critics who are better than them in terms of actually reviewing films. 




  I'm a biologist, not an astronomer

I read that in Dr. McCoy's voice 




 Why would they go to SDCC and show nothing? That is definitely not the place to disappoint. 




 It looks more like a Japanish one to me 




 What about the names? 




 I guess so - I can imagine we might get a plot synopsis, cause Kasdan will be there. 




 No, it really wouldn't. It gives background information of what's been going on in the past 30 years. It's not like the crawl for ESB mentioned Vader being Luke's father... 




 *George Lucas 




 Yeah but I don't see any reason why Disney would put Star Wars in a place where studious usually go all out just to tell a couple of behind the scenes stories and some pictures. 

And besides, they don't want Star Wars to be overshadowed by DC if another BvS trailer comes out - they want to be the ones breaking the records for trailer views, not their competitors.  




 Same with every other person who's claimed to have seen it... 




 Yeah 




 That was still a teaser 




 Really?? That's the movie of his you're saying is bad (which it isn't)?

Not Meet the Fockers? Ishtar? 




 ITS A TOMATO! A TOMATO DOESNT HAVE LOGIC!! 




 Now back to 9/11 




 I don't believe it. Why would they choose not to have a Marvel presence at a *comic* convention? Did they only put Star Wars there for a few behind the scenes videos? Doesn't add up.

At the very least we'll get some new information and a poster, but I wouldn't give up hope on seeing a trailer or a third teaser. 




 What about D23? 




 The EW article is in the tumblr page. Actually click the link. 




 I wouldn't give up hope completely.

Who knows? This might not even be true. At the very least we'll get some new bits of info, and maybe some behind the scenes footage of even a poster. 




 Sry m8 - just confirmed that there's no trailer at CC whatsoever 




 Damn it. Well at least we can put all the "leaks" in the garbage bin. 




 It sounds believable but you have no proof. Some of that is based on rumors, some are just things that one would logically assume. I could very easily make up something like that and have it sound true.

Not saying that it's all BS, but I'm just gonna have to take it with a grain of salt. 




 Yup - I think they'd rather have an official high quality version than a bunch of shitty phone camera ones 




 How would your friend who works in VFX know anything about the releases of the trailers, and where Rogue One takes place? I highly doubt what's shown at SDCC will be exclusive to that. 




 Totally - that and the World's Fair bit were the best parts of the movie. 




 That's awesome - I've always loved that style of drawing. 




 I bet Disney will release the whole panel online, too. That's exactly what they don't want, low quality leaks. 




 Well I would think that Disney would rather have a high quality version come out instead of a million bad-quality phone recordings. 




 The standalone movie 2 is coming 2018, I'm pretty sure.

I think the release schedule is:

The Force Awakens - Dec. 18th 2015
Rogue One - Dec. 16th 2016
Episode 8 - May 26th 2017
Standalone 2 - 2018
Episode 9 - 2019
Potential Standalone 3 - 2020 




 No - I think both Kathleen Kennedy and JJ Abrams realize that these new movies can't rely on nostalgic references to older movies. They're trying to get a new generation into the Star Wars world, and if they want to do that, they must put story first, and not callbacks to earlier films that the audience might not understand. 




 Jenississ 




 Says the man who starred in *Ishtar* 




 Uh huh. 




 Why? They have literally nothing to do with each other. 




 NO I HATE IT WHEN KIDS INTERRUPT MY VIEWING OF A KIDS MOVIE!!!!  




 Stop. 









 Of course it will. It's a *Marvel* movie. 




 Not that there's anything wrong with that... 




 Yeah but it's not foreign. Foreign director =\= foreign film. It has a 60.000.000 budget, is being distributed by a major (American) studio, stars American actors, and was filmed in Canada. 




 The Revenant doesn't really qualify as a foreign film though, does it? 




 Yub Nub is the shit man 




 Yeah - a lot of the rumored plot points, like Boyega being a stormtrooper, turned out to be true, even though they were talked about way before they were confirmed to be real. 




 *July 




 I think it reads like a trailer. Scenes from the film that gave dialogue about the plot? New character and location reveals? Pretty trailer-ish 




 It is, but here's my theory as to what happened.

The chocolate was originally wrapped on the outside, but they did it wrong, causing all of them to turn out like [this](http://imgur.com/Ek3DA3K)

So, they unwrapped all of them and closed them the right way, leaving most of them completely unwrapped and some of them partially wrapped in plastic, like [so](http://imgur.com/H9gMiQR) 




 No, your point is pretty simple. I would literally read absolutely nothing into it 




 The artists names maybe? 




 You know that the narration is re-recorded dialogue from Return of the Jedi, right? It's not supposed to mean anything (concerning Vader). 




 Maybe something to do with the alphabetization of the name? 




 I think it's pretty clear what it's saying, actually.  









 Tomorrowland.... 




 I still don't think it's possible to fast forward live television... 




 It's not out yet... And it's very likely that this is completely fake. 




 It's still fun to read, even if it's not real... 




 The Phantom Menace trailer has nothing to do with how good this trailer is. And the director is good, he's shown that he is. All of his movies are well-directed movies.  




 Probably fake, but awesome nonetheless. It's fun to talk about this kinda thing, even though it might not be real. 




 The Star Wars prequels are pretty boring in a lot of parts if you think about it - trade negotiations, boring scenes of sitting on couches and talking, stupid dialogue - and those still made tons of money - the same would apply to Jurassic Park (which, by the way, I don't find boring in any part). 
























 I particularly disagree with the breaking the illusion - watch the space battle from RotJ, probably one of the best I've seen. I do agree that the prequel fights were more seamless 




 SPAAACCEE COOOPPP!! 




 It's gonna come down to Justice League Part 2 and Infinity War Part 2 coming in the same year. 




 Which is not a bad thing 




 I think Liberals are just as much against ISIS as everyone else 




 I thought Part II was the most exciting of the whole trilogy... 




 What cringey moments are there in The Empire Strikes Back?  




 That's similar to how I felt about Whiplash - I really enjoyed it, I thought it was well written, and great performances were given, but it's pretty one-dimensional when you think about it. Not much to interpret or reflect on, everything it's trying to say is just *there*, given to you. 




 But the cinematography is supposed to resemble a stage play 




 But *he's* usually fine in those movies, even if the movies themselves are not. He is good at giving a fun charismatic performance. 




 First of all, the reveal is at the end of Empire, not in the middle.

And I think you're forgetting that we know Anakin impregnated Padme in Revenge of the Sith, and Padme later gives birth to Luke. We also see Anakin become Vader. 




 The art ones that were released at Star Wars Celebration 




 I think that particular part (space battles) can be very challenging and expensive, I think they'd rather use CGI for it. 




 Whoa, I never would've thought of that.... 




 ... Up Girl 




 I mean there's only really been 2 movie Jokers, and the other one that you have to compare Nicholson with is Ledger, so... 




 Yeah 




 Just curious about your reasoning behind Kubrick and Pixar? 




 That's the 70s for ya 




 I hope you got that they were making a reference to something 




 I don't think that necessarily has to do with anything - anyone who has good taste in movies can easily see which is better. 




 Fucking Zack. 




 QUALITY POST RIGHT HERE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN 




 There's no depth to any of the characters really, mostly due to the fact that Nolan likes to put action and visuals above actors a lot of the time. The only reason Ledger was good is because he's already a pretty good performer. 




  an unpopular *opinion*

That is a fact, my friend. 




 Anything's silly if you describe it like that, those things work in the Star Wars universe. 




 The Godfather Part III isn't bad at all (minus Sofia Coppola), they're just not as good as the first 2. 




 The civil rights novelty? What is that supposed to mean? 




 That could be cool 




 What's with 3PO having red on the left and the First Order TIE also having red on the left? Almost the same shade, too. 




 I think it depends if you bought it or if someone loaned it to you  




 Chunky mayonnaise with stale Goldfish crackers? 




 I can tell things are gonna get *weird* once that movie comes out.... 




 Get some of the "making of" books for Episodes 1 and 2 - you can see that there really is a lot of effort put into sets and miniatures, along with things like the design of costumes and ships.

People act like no one actually tried on these movies, when that's really not true to any extent. 




 You know that Sony products have been in Bond movies since the 60's, right? 




 So when someone doesn't like a movie that /r/movies likes, we downvote it, but when someone doesn't like a movie that /r/movies *doesn't* like, we upvote it? 




 But why wouldn't a car company sponsor all the vehicles in an amusement park? You act like there's *not* a Starbucks on every block in real life. 




 Yeah - he would've aged the right amount, and Alderaan's not gone yet! 




 I mean in terms of the two teasers, the cast, and the crew 




 Good point 




 I mean, he was the chosen one! 




 Don't you mean 12:01am 12/19? 




 Google is your friend in situations like these 




 Who cares if we haven't done it since? We've proved that we're capable of doing it, but now we're striving for bigger and better things. 




 But keep in mind that JJ didn't write those 




 Well, from what we've seen so far  




 None of those things are actually true though  




 So is basically every other Star Wars character, if you think about it - it takes time to get to know the person, and eventually you'll get used to it. 




 [uj] But you still can't deny that this movie will be great [rj] 




 It's possible that they could've written that in after Ridley was cast - they could also have it as a reveal in VIII or IX 




 Anything to keep this sub from overflowing with fake leaks 




 He's a director, of a lot of mainstream movies I'm sure you've heard of.

The Dark Knight. Inception. Interstellar. 




 Yeah, also because there already are Asian actors in this movie 




 Only if it's IMAX 2D 




 Sorry, "Monty Python" 




 The piano? Just non-Star Wars related notes 




 That's a Warwick Davis 




 That's why we should have weekly discussion threads or something, to keep us busy. 




 Make that a rule.

9/24, not bad 




 Carries already there, and there's two seats left still - Luke and Han 




 Two seats left - I'm calling Serkis and MVS 




 General Hux! 




 Jurassic World director
 




 Thanks 




 Look at the size of that thing! 




 Haha you printed it out! My work! It feels so good!

And by the way, Ridley and Boyega showed up. 




 Not saying he's right, but might as well wait until tonight. It's a pretty risky move saying something like this if it won't turn out to be true. 




 From this

http://imgur.com/7qZfFR8 




 Well, I meant on this sub 




 I'm not unfortunately - I just saw this on Instagram, but I'm sure there will be *plenty* of updates after/during the panel. 




 I don't doubt that I will be, but it's not like this is new news either - this is the same wording they used when they announced the panel last month. 




 They are if they're getting a lot of views and making money from it 




 [uj/] Hey, I was the one who responded to him, and I post here pretty frequently - I was just giving him a reason as to why it was on the front page, and he was sorta being an asshole about it [uj] 




 So if the *same shot* was filmed by a different director you would've rolled your eyes? Why?? 




 Well what else would they be showing? Special look is pretty vague, and we know there's not gonna be a trailer or footage - it's probably gonna be exactly what you expect. Nothing that groundbreaking or exciting. 




 That's the panel 




 "I wanted cake!" 









 I think Spielberg wants to stay far away from those Jaws sequels  




 To see the trailer, I meant - I have the app and everything already 




 Realistically, he would end up directing Indy 5 with Chris Pratt, if that ever happens  




 Why would they go from a flat logo to a glossy one? That's the opposite of what most companies are doing. 




 Oh yeah, all 20 million of them? Makes sense.  




 Looks a little like a custom, but probably real. 




 Probably. 




 Yeah, it's that part im worried about 




 Ugh. Does that mean I also have to register with a Disney account? I hope not.... 




 Thanks a bunch! 




 Can you put up my SDCC bingo?

http://imgur.com/cJBVoVb 




 Yeah but that's the name of the Star Wars alphabet 




 I think it might be to late, from what I've heard. 




 Check where? 




 Me too... 




 I looked around a little, but I couldn't find anything unfortunately. 




 No it doesn't - that would be like saying there was too much news coverage about 9/11 on 9/14 




 Beating a dead horse that's only 8 days old?  




 I think the part you actually need to scan is cut out of that picture. 




 Posting their video is a circlejerky thing? It's funny and it relates to this subreddit. 




 Me too. Did you hear the dialogue it had (the Stormtrooper)? 




 "This December" was in the last trailer, I don't know why *that* would clue you into to this description being fake. 




 Yoda disappeared when he died in Return of the Jedi. Anakin did when Luke burned the Darth Vader suit in that same movie. 




 I *really* doubt it. For one thing, he's too old to be playing a young (15-25 year old) Han. Secondly, he looks very little like Harrison Ford, and doesn't sound remotely like him either. The people at Disney are smart, and I think they are well aware of the fact that this choice will be heavily scrutinized, so I would expect them to cast an unknown actor who has the same mannerisms as Ford.  




 But I doubt the source is Lucasfilm, or else it would've been published as official news from them. 




 YOULL NO LONGR FEAR THE DARK SIDE!!!!!!,;$!!! 




 http://imgur.com/8CbPxWs

That? 




 "Star Wars Sequel Trilogy"

I need ratings, plot synopsizes, titles, whatever I can get 




 That sounds pretty good to me  




 I'm not staying up late just for that, and I don't know why you would either, especially considering you just called him an asshole.
