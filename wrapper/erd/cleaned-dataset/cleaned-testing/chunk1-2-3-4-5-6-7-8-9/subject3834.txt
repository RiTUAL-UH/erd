 Yep.  I'm loving how easy the BB onebro run is so far in comparison, though I know some parts end game are gonna be much togher :D 




 Is the auto record always set on by default?  Because it seems like it is, as I notice that when I go to the share menu, there always seems to be a video recording, and it gives me the option of "save this video clip."  I never realized it was on from the jump I guess, it just seems kinda obtuse, and I thought the menu was just wonky. 




 Right now it's Heynryk, cuz that bastard killed the crow lady on my level 4 BeastBro runthrough, and I was really counting on getting that Hunter Oath rune from her to help the waste of skin build not suck ass.  The other Oath runes fuckin suck, and this guy is a dick.  My viscerals only do like, 100 damage with a +4 hunter's axe, he has a couple thousand HP, and he one or two shots me with either his pistol or cleaver.  Ahem.  Did I mention what a dick he is? 




 So, doing it the way you mention doing it (double tapping to start, and letting it just go on its own) you have to be careful then to make sure you save the footage you want, if say, you reach the end of a 15 minute loop, because then it will start recording over that original loop?  Thanks. 




 When people refer to monsters, yes, one-shot is the instagib, but when a lot of players say it in regards to boss fights, they mean they beat it the first time around.  Speaking of which, I just one-shotted the cleric beast and papa G on my current 4bro (lowest level you can be) run-through.  I think I forgot papa G, who sucked, but I did record the cleric beast fight (if I worked it properly).  Will try and figure out this PS share crap and upload it soon.

Edit:  goddammit.  Looks like I recorded 15 minutes before the cleric beast, but not the actual cleric beast fight.  Still have yet to figure out these annoying share features on PS4   So is it double tap "share" button to start recording?  And double tap it again to stop recording? 




 That is way too much work.  I also one-shot killed Gherman in like, 60 seconds on NG+.  He is so easy to parry, and with +30% and +20% clawmark ruins, he died in like, 4 viscerals  :D 




 Really?  That's kind of shitty.  Can I expect the same solid performance once they fix it?  Or from the next one? 




 Ok - so I've had this PS4 for a few months, hardly used it before BB was released, I've never shut it down improperly, never dropped or damaged it in any way, and I think it's only gone into rest mode once or twice, and out of the blue it initiated in a weird loop when I started it up today.  I am currently googling potential fixes and what not, but any suggestions or known fixes in the mean time?  Thanks in advance for your replies.  This is pretty damn disappointing for an expensive piece of hardware :/


Edit:  I tried starting the PS4 in safe mode, but it won't even do that.  I'm stumped...


Edit:  It's seemingly now on, with the PS4 noises/music playing in the background, but my input screen on the TV (HDMI2) is blinking repeatedly on and off, but it isn't staying on enough to display an image or menu.  I know both inputs on the TV work fine, as I have already tested them.  Not sure what to do or where to go from here.


Edit edit:  Found a fix that worked!  The problem lay somewhere in between the TV itself, the input channel, and it's communication with the PS4.  I followed the instructions below, and it seemingly cleared up the issues, and now the input channel is staying on, and BB is loaded up and ready to play.  Thanks for your input  :)

1- Power off TV

2- Unplug TV from outlet

3- Press and hold in the power button on the TV for 30 seconds (while it is unplugged from the wall)

4- Release the power button

5- Plug in the TV into a different outlet

6- Power the TV back on 




 Eh. With how OP you could easily make your gear in DaS 2, the difficulty spike wasnt as noticeable. BB seems more akin to the leap in DaS, but the jump is less and less noiceable, especially as you learn the game and get better at it. I definately felt the pain a bit through NG+, but I'm In NG++ right now and have one-shot every boss so far, and am currently on my way to go kill darkbeast Paarl and then the shadows. Even in chalice dungeons at depth 5, I'm finding hot dogs and undead giants and ebriaites ridiculously easy to one shot.  Now I'm sad, because I'm worried I'll bore of this game quicker than the other titles...  Will probably wind up doing a level 4 run sooner rather than later.  




 Eh, even then, I was more enraptured by Halo, in both story and gameplay, and that was a long time ago. Even Defiance had a better story and comparable yet more original mehanics, and that was years ago too. Destiny is the epitome of "meh."  One big over-hyped, well-polished turd :/ 




 Depends.  If you are going to mostly solo on your toon (as i do on my main), you can do whatever you like, but if you wanted to keep it more co-op viable, for ease and quick matches, I'd stick to somewhere around 100-120, and just make different toons for more focused arcane or BT builds. 




 What level are you?  If you wanted to stay within majority pvp/co-op range, you're looking at pumping your two weakest stats (BT and arcane), and that could likely put you over range depending on what you wanted to do with this character.  I'd say this toon is already geared towards STR and dex, and stick to those weapon types with the quality build, and just make an alt character if you wanted to focus dex and arcane or BT. 




 For most grab attacks, you can mash your L+R buttons (supposedly any buttons) to get out of the attacks quicker, take less damage, and in the case of the brain suckers, only lose 1 or 2 insight.  Knowledge is power! 




 Wow. That's pretty good. My girlfriend would totally fap to this :) 




 Yeah, I'm in the same boat as you.  I bought a new PS4 for this game, and as great as it is, the frame rates and stutters are particularly obnoxious, and quite frankly, dissapointing.


The caves, old yharnam, chalice dungeons (or anywhere the witches summon the dreadlocked slender women) and quite a lot of places in general experience frame loss, and originally when I went into Old Yharnam, I was getting some terrible frame stutters where the sound track/game would make machine gun noises and almost seem like it was gonna crash or crap out.  Woohoo next gen?  As for solutions, well, I'm not sure.  I'd suggest installing some new RAM and maybe getting another video card or two to put in there, but, ahem, it's a console :D 




 Dude...you're totally right! 




 Nice write up, but one thing:  do you really think Destiny was even "mildly amusing?"  I never understood how people could play that game for more than, maybe an hour?  Between the lack of remotely interesting story and characters, the uninspired gameplay and unoriginal mechanics, and the fact they were already recycling levels/maps by mission number 3 or 4, I just don't understand how anyone could stomach that game for more than a few days at most.  Seriously.  How did more people not take a shit on that game and mail it back to the devs and demand their money back?  No offence to the people who liked it, but that was the most hyped turd to ever turd on a turd and then ask for even more turds!  Sure, I get game-play compulsion, but even then, that game was terrible!
 




 Yeah.  Now I'm one-shotting ebriatises and hot dogs and amygdalas and undead giants and ghermans in NG++ and in chalice dungeons level 5... makes me kind of sad actually :( 




 
Shut up and take my money! 




 But who was the mummified hot-dog you got the gesture from in the first place?  In keeping with the lore and the story, I think it was Elvis Presley or Michael Jackson.  Vaati is confirming this right now. 




 All for the PC if you can (with a controller), as there are solid mods to increase the frame rates and graphics, which are pretty mediocre on a console. BB had some terrible frame rate issues too unfortunately. 


That being said, yes, you got better (as from games demand), and you learned from your mistakes. Just be warned that the pace of DaS is quite different from BB. Don't expect to use the same methodology and style as you did in BB. Just be patient, and apply the same ability to learn or try new angles to fight and exploration, and you'll no doubt enjoy the experience.  




 Well - I like how beasthood and insight are inverse to each other, as it fits the story and lore so perfectly, but I wish it had been used more, or if it was relevant or useful at all. That being said, people got way too hyped and spread too many rumors about theoretical besst-mode before the game was ever released, so the fail of that hype is on them :D 




 All the other hunters and humanoids (logarius, gherman, and shadows included) are a joke compared to Eileen's hunter.  He just heals so much :D 




 Yep.  So far, the Cathedral Hunter was the only (non) boss I truly cheesed after dying to him repeatedly for an hour, and I've been in the habit of one-shotting undead giants and Ebriatises and hotdogs and amygdalas in depth 5 Chalice dungeons.  Killed Father G on NG++ in 1 minute, killed Gherman in NG+ in like, 30 seconds (3 or 4 parries), one-shotted The One Reborn in NG and NG+, and still, I have nightmares of the Cathedral Hunter on NG... 




 Play blind your first go through:  no spoilers, hints, help, or anything your first run through, as you only get that experience once, because once you're well-practiced and learn the maps and methods well enough, the game becomes super easy and is actually quite linear, though the great level design helps hide how straight-forward the game truly is.


Edit:  But it is definitely a great game, and the main game is challenging at first, as the way you fight in the previous Souls series just can't and won't translate to success in Bloodborne.  Relearning to fight in BB is fantastic.  Also worth noting, the higher depth chalice dungeons can definitely be challenging, and they keep the game challenging, but I don't know how it will translate for longevity. Also, the multiplayer system kinda sucks, and PvP connectivity sucks as well - can take a long time to find a match.  Hopefully they fix it soon. Have fun! 




 Haha.  My favorite so far was two bell maidens on a higher tier right next to the lamp where you entered the later at, so as soon as I spawned, red spiders were landing on me, then I ran into the room next door with the spiders still and continually following me, and the room was filled with undead tomb prospectors and dogs and the cannon-armed undead giant making a cameo as a regular enemy... yeah, lots of lube indeed! 




 Hotdog Asshole in cursed Lorain dungeon, Chester the Mollester and his Bag of Dead Hookers, Crows that Think They Are Dogs, and That One Fucking Asshole Hunter in the Grand Cathedral. 




 Eh. I felt the same way as I chored my way through the easier dungeons, but I enjoyed the... Challenge of some of the lower ones, and by the time I could make a lot of the community posted chalices by collecting all the chalices, I had an excess of all the highest tier crafting mats (except sage's hair).  And the coolest thing is, once you make a root dungeon of any type, you can create any of the community dungeons that were made with the exact same materials (ie, cursed or defiled) for free.  Worth noting, some of the dungeons are ridiculous with enemy placement and difficulty. Nothing like fighting a cannon-armed undead boss giant in a room fille with dogs and undead tomb prospectors :D


Edit:  it's worth it. And if you do them in progression order, you should wind up with more than enough crafting materials so there should be no extra grind at all. So far I have collected 3 blood rocks from different dungeons of different types, and I b-lined it for all the runes I use the most (like tier 3 claw mark).   




 Yeah. Some bosses you have to work out their timing and you can actually use the jump to your advantage, but most of the time it's a liability. To work around it, I just walk instead of run, and depending on how bad the camera angles are, I lock on and strafe, or just walk and roll to a favorable position, like being at the bosses side or back.  




 Don't worry, the deeper chalices are often harder than the main game :P 




 Even though it took forever, FROM (well, B team) eventually implemented what started as a player idea of having a ring (or item or w/e) to absorb souls to keep soul memory locked and not increase.


Hopefully that lesson remained with them (or was absorbed by A team), and they are implementing some arenas or summon signs and other technical improvements to fix these issues.  I don't understand why they used the wonky-ass bell system.  They could have just had your messengers hold up a bell for you that could have thematically and aesthetically matched the game, yet function in the exact same way that the summon signs did in previous games.  And also, that shit shouldn't use up your insight unless you actually connect.  Here's hoping they fix it :( 




 Don't we all miss soul memory now :/


Sure, it was an annoying system at first, but at least you could find quick matches  




 Not to mention, they are often PvP built and equipped, and often are experienced trollers, er, invaders when it comes to the souls series :P 




 I wanted to like the wheel for some smashie smashie, but honestly, the range sucks ass and it's just way too slow and uses a lot of STA.  I like Kirkhammer, because again smashie smashie, but the moveset on hunter's axe for both untransformed and transformed is just too fun, too universal, and too badass to pass up.  Between the 1h and 2h moveset, I have found a solid compromise between slash and smash. 




 I remember a few people posting about how it bugged out their game - and I can't remember if it was progression, or optional areas, but in all cases, to do what they wanted, they had to restore their saved files.


EDIT:  It might have been some of the other skips/bugs in game, but either way, players should know the risks of possibly bugging out their games. 




 In all seriousness though, don't let other people and reviews and all the hype of the 'hardness' fool you.  The one deciding factor worth considering is you:  will you learn how to play the game, learn from your mistakes, and in general become a better player in the way that FROM demands that you become a better player?  If so, yes, go for it.  If not, then don't purchase it.


While other games play more like movies (quick time events, and simple, easy narratives) that are almost impossible to lose even if you try, Bloodborne (and FROM in general) utilizes the gaming experience in a way that seldom developers do, not just in their mysterious narratives, but they force you to learn from your mistakes, as when the rubber hits the road in these games, there really is no just derping and dragging your way through these game.

Again, the game is hard but fair, and if you can learn from your mistakes, learn the mechanics, learn the attacks and methods of the enemies you are fighting, and in general, become better (as the game will demand that you become a better player) than yes, I would advise you to get it.  If you're not looking something to really challenge you in the video game medium, than no, don't get it.  Good hunting to you o/ 




 Whoa.  Thank you.  I have no idea how gold works or what I can do with it, but I assure you I will put it to good use.... does it by chance un-ban me from the subreddits that have given me the boot?  :P 




 Yeah.  I've seen a bunch of posts from people who messed up their games using jump skips and things like that, asking about the problems it has caused for the games, which seem to be irriversable.  It's still a short run, even without the skip.  Good luck to you! 




 But they clearly bark in both the 'waking world' and the nightmare. 




 Be warned - FROM will ruin gaming for you, and other games will feel like Hello Kitty's Island Adventure, where you run around slapping little girls with wet noodles that have no impact, and there is no risk and little reward. 




 Careful though, and be sure to back up your save files.  These skips aren't intentional, and they have been known to bug out the game or make you miss out on certain opportunities due to the nature of the bug. 




 This game follows same format as Dark Souls.  Dark Souls 2 was B-Team's ideas and methods.  That being said, the game is actually super linear and you can get back to the end game content within an hour or two if you memorized the game fairly well, as so many areas are either optional, or easy to run past.


To get to the first part of the nightmare, you only need to kill Cleric Beast, Papa G, and then Vicar.   Then just head to forbidden woods (or the other houses with lanterns) and get the tonsil stone.  To get to the second half of the nightmare (game progression, not the first optional part of the nightmare), Just add Shadows, Rom, and The One Reborn to the list, and boom, you're there. 




 Yeah. It's fun when they show up as normal enemies in the chalice dungeons... Surrounded by dogs and those weird undead fuckers... 




 No. It's a short cut to midway point in that elevator. If I remember correctly, you walk across a tile type roof top, and if you look at the elevator shaft, there are tiers like steps and you can hop back down to the bottom. Sorry to spoil it for you, but it's nothing too exciting :) 




 PSA - depending on your play style, The -HP ones aren't worth it. They cancel out your rally potential every time you take a tick of damage. 


Also, i feel like cursed gems are kind of unnecessary, because there are plenty of solid non-cursed ones. I use a regular hunters axe at around 490 on the stat screen, and the only downside is one of the gems has +2.9% Stamina usage on its +22% physical damage. No other curses on that thing though.  




 Yeah. Levels don't make that much of a difference once you have a specialized build at around 100-120. That being said, I wish there were more things to spend blood echoes on :/ 




 Ha.  We have the exact same build - except I rounded up to a nice even level 175 with 28 arcane instead of 25.  Now I'm running around in NG++ with a million+ echoes at most times, so I'm debating on raising up to level 198 to 50 arcane...   




 LOL casuls 




 Title says it all.  But yes, I have googled it, yes, I have read multiple posts that say the same thing, but it doesn't seem clear, since I get nothing but error messages from dungeons I try here on the reddit list and elsewhere.  Also, yes, I read the chalice dungeon reddit wiki, and it said something like, "you must have created the exact same chalice," but I tried that, and even then when I try to use a glyph, I still receive the message "you do not meet the requirements" or whatever it is.  And if that is true, that you must have already made one of the same exact dungeons to use a glyph, isn't that a bit obtuse and redundant?  Does that mean you need double the crafting materials for every glyph you want to use?  And does that mean you must leave both tombstones occupied with those chalices if you want to create similar glyphs?


For example, I mainly wanted to create this dungeon:  http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/805577-bloodborne/71574146

It is a Lower Loran with fetid + rotting offerings


Yet, if I try to even make a lower loran chalice dungeon, I don't even have the options to use the offerings of fetid and rotting - so how can I even create a chalice to use that glyph in the first place?  Point is, I am thoroughly confused and frustrated.  Thanks in advance for your replies -_- 




 I sort of agree with him on a lot of it.  Insight isn't relevant enough, the game needs more invasions, it would have been cool if the game wasn't so linear, and I am mixed on the blood vial thing.  On one hand, some boss battles are challenging, and can be drawn out if you play carefully and patiently, so less blood vials would suck there.  Also, enemies can still kill you super quickly in some combos and fast or hard hitting attacks, so the numbers aren't so much of a problem there, but on the other hand, 20 is a lot of vials to carry, and yes, sometimes it makes the game way too easy.... 




 Is this the memory leak type deal everyone talks about? 




 If you stick a bit to his right, not too far from his foot, he will mostly just stomp at you, leaving one of his left hands hanging in the air that you can whack on (don't lock on at all for the whole fight).  You gotta be ready to dodge though, because he will flail and go crazy and slam his fists around here and there.  Anyway, you can totally take him down quickly using this strategy, and once he gets to his final phase, just cheese him by chasing his tail, because he will only jump forward, not backwards.  Just stay behind him, and mind his foot stomps, chase him when he jumps, and whack his tail again.  Rinse and repeat till dead.


Edit:  no memory leak or anything like that.  It just baits him into certain attacks and moves and turns this fight into cheese mode. 




 And to think, I fought Amagdala for the first time in NG+ the good old-fashioned suck-ass way - got my ass handed to me and took a lot of patience 


That being said, it's kinda lame that if you barely stick to his right, you can just whack at his hand and he mostly just stomps his feet :/ 




 Ha.  Just beat him.  This did the trick:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dsd9S_Crp0

No memory leak or anything.  It was hard to get past the first phase or 2 for me, as I got hit a lot, though I dodged even more, as I couldn't bait as expertly as this dude did, but cheesing him in the last was easy. 




 Yup.  Just got to this asshole, and after a quick test go to see what it's like, I've decided that the "defiled dungeon" is the stupidest shit mechanic ever 


Edit:  I don't know if I'm gonna have the patience for this fight. Gimmie a challenging, punishing boss fight, sure, but don't inflate the difficulty by giving me half HP for a boss that would likely 1hKO me anyhow. 




 That might help.  I'm too high level to help you though, not that the levels make much of a difference in this game, but i wind up rolling in 1 million echoes at a time in NG+, so what else am I gonna do with em other than level up? 




 What level?  I'm close to this boss in my game. Just soloed the hot dog last night. 


Edit: but honestly, these bosses take patience, an more people seems like more of a liability than not.  




 There is no proof that Rom is human.  That, and every other human in game gets a lot of screen time in item descriptions, dialogue, or interaction, yet there is none of that in regards to Rom, which would seem like a huge oversight.  What we do get are several references to the Bygenwyrth spider (Rom), who keeps the master (the great ones) away from it's seekers/pupils (the cultists).  A lot of people interpret that note to mean Rom keeps wilhem from his peeps, but I don't think that is the case.  Rom somehow cock-blocks or mutes the rituals the cultists are trying to create, hence, once you kill Rom, the blood moon or paleblood moon or whatever lights up the sky and the crazy people in Yahr Guhl finish their ritual to bring forth the one reborn and turn people to stone and other crazy shit.  This is further supported by the notes that say, "the spider keeps rituals from us," and other crazy shit like that.


The point is, people keep interpreting Micolash's vague madman speech to mean that Rom was granted a gift of many eyes by the great ones, but that is just one interpretation, never-mind the contradiction of, 'why would the great-ones help Rom in any way? specifically since he is obviously somehow blocking their rituals and blocking the cultists from contacting or bringing forth the other great ones?'  It's just as likely that Micolash just means, "make me as you made rom," like someone might say, "I wish I could fly, like the birds in the sky."  Worth noting, Micolash says the lake has turned to mud or whatever, which again, is reference to Rom somehow interfering with the other great ones and the cultists' rituals.  I've posted about Rom and Micolash and other relations in many related posts - might be worth looking at the other lore theories people have posted for sure. Either way, we still don't know the how's or the where's or the why's of Rom....and it all only brings up more questions. 




 I LOL'd way harder than I should have.  Also,I like it how you have zero bloodtinge :D 




 Yep.  I only fought the dude in NG+, so I can't speak of the NG cycle, but even in NG+, I could kill the sword in the ground with either one hit from my weapon, or even 1 shot from my +9 hunter's pistol (I only have like, 6 bloodtinge), so you don't even need a strong shot on it. 




 Well, it's not like rocks are all that common either, but there is a lot less gear to upgrade :D 




 I can confirm similar results.  With 250+ (slightly higher) discovery (2 eye runes+25 arcane stat) I found about 8-9 chunks in using exactly 15 BHM's (started with 45, but ended with 30), HOWEVER, I only killed the first 4 easy and quick to get to werewolves.  I never bothered with the 5th since he was up the stairs, down the hall, and out of the way :D 




 Haha.  I like how you over-simplified everything.  Shit gets crazy in-depth complex.  Just look up "lore" in this subreddit, or go youtube "davecontrollive" or "vaatividya" bloodborne youtube videos (they are some of the go to's when it comes to making money off youtube souls content, I mean, lore)  :) 




 Dead hookers.  First time I saw that fucker, I said to myself, *"I know the type."*  Those are with out a doubt, sacks of dead hookers.  Vaati already confirmed it bro. 




 Question is in the title. Thanks on advance for your replies.  




 By life-swallowing, I just mean those organizations that heavily indoctrinate you from an early age, from all angles, and that essentially try to run your life and be the central, most important facet of your existence.   And a follow up:  How did you come to find that it wasn't for you?  And how did you come to find your own identity in the world? 




 As the non-spoiler title doesn't say, What's through the locked door at the bottom (or middle) of the pit trough the door/lift in chapel ward that unlocks after you kill BSB?


I'm not talking about the door to the abandoned workshop. But IIRC there is a locked golden-ornate looking door (guarded by a werewolf iirc) either at the bottom of that pit, or maybe the middle section. Can anyone please tell me where that leads to? I accidentally beat the game and never got around to opening it up. Thanks. 

 




 Hey all.  I already accidentally beat the game in a no-spoiler/help run, so I am going through NG+ trying out all the optional stuff I missed or was barred from completing upon being booted to NG+, and with the tonsil stone/Amygdala, are there any immediate consequences for defeating that boss?  Will it change the progression in anyway, or bar me from completing other quest lines or cut off any other optional areas?  Also, since getting to the Amygdala puts you in Nightmare Frontier early, can you progress through that at all?  Or is it just a portion of it, and you have to follow the normal progression? Thanks in advance for your replies. 




 The chest right after father G in the study on the way to the Oedon Chapel had a kin cold blood in it. I swear it had a regular cold blood in it the first time round, because I think I would remember an item that gave me 20k souls at level 15, and the first time i saw a kin coldblood in my first play-trough was when i killed Ron the Grumpy Caterpillar. Can anyone else confirm or deny?  Or did you find anything to make you think otherwise?  Thanks in advance for your response.  




 U r all HIV bluud fagetz cuz u killt ravid siff!  wreckt 




 Mainly, what the fuck?  I somewhat fancy myself a pro when it comes to piecing together FROM lore, but even with playing part-time detective through Bloodborne, what the fuck just happened?


Also, super annoyed that it automatically kicked me to NG+. I didn't even get a chance to +10 a weapon  




 Loving how the game keeps getting weirder and weirder!  As odd as the fight seemed at first, I really loved the Ron the Angry Caterpillar encounter!  I kinda felt bad killing it though, since it started off just sitting there, minding it's own business like some kinda funky, own-business-minding, giant outer-space slug :/


And then the stuff that's coming after that... whoa!  I am thoroughly confused and confounded, though I have my conspiracy theories as to what species had sex with which to make all these vicious magic monsters!  All critiques aside, this is a fantastic game! 




 Be honest please.  I don't want to hear disclaimers, fluffy plattitudes, PC nonsense, or rationalizations and justification.  Just be honest, and feel free to be extra mean about it :)

edit:  derp ta terp 









 You know, that one guy, who is in the tower with the gatling gun who mows you down if you stop to lace up your corset?  Does he drop anything of consequence?  I ask, because, after dying to him stupidly a bunch, I accidentally killed him by kicking him out of the tower, and he fell to and died on the walkway below, but the item(s) he dropped were just floating in mid-air above the ground, impossible to pick up.  I tried reloading and dying, but the items just dissapeared.


Loving the game so far, but some of the little bugs like this, among the stuttering and frame loss has been a bummer.  Anyway, thanks in advance for your replies. 




 LOL Fagz amirite?  My beby alreadyy staurved to deth cuz I to buzy playin Bleedbourne Soulz to feed teh littul faget.  Stupid casul babee faget got WRECKT!1  I tuld it to git guud an now I use it as a doorsttop!

 









 This subreddit is awesome, I can't wait to participate, and I have a serious question here:  To go more in-depth than just the title, what if easy going, non-greedy Joe-Bloe has one reddit account, and posts once to get in on the drawing, and donates his part, while Joe-Bitch and Joe-Biznitch are friends, and together have 100 different reddit accounts each, and they can and will join the same drawing with 200 entries.  Is there anyway to weed this out?  I mean, never mind one person with multiple accounts, there could be multiple people pooling in, or any number of Joe-Biznitches out there.  


While I understand the necessity of paying as a donation rather than buying in, it's sort of a bummer to know that it can be so easily abused.  Never mind the possibility of someone using a bunch of accounts to enter the drawing, but there is a chance that they wouldn't even be donating their part to the actual winner anyway.  Not trying to be a bummer or anything, and I still plan on participating, but I was curious as to what everyone thought about it, or if there are any security measures in place to try to help weed out things like this?  Is it just one of those things that 'goes with the territory' of this premise and subreddit?  Thanks in advance for your replies.

 Hi all.  As the title said, I haven't really played much since the month of the last DLC (Ivory King), and I was wondering with all the news of the Sin of The First Flame and patches, if anything has really changed in game?  I don't mean the basics, like, katanas were buffed and lightning spears were nerfed again, but I'm just curious if they added any new areas or NPC's or more experience-changing elements like that.  Thanks in advance for your replies :) 




 And found it near completely lackluster, flat, and...boring?

 nbsp;

I mean, once upon a time it was great fun to me (haven't played it seriously/competitively since wrath) - and I was dissapointed to find it as seemingly dull as I have as of late.  I suppose my expectations and I have changed a bit over the years, but the fundamentals of WoW haven't.  That being said,  I remember it once seemed like a high point in PvP play for MMO's, but I'm thinking that I might be comparing it too much to all the games I've played since then.  


I mean, GW2 does large scale/siege combat much better, and is a little bit more action oriented, Rift did class trees/systems and basic combat better, Tera has more interactive and fun comat, EvE carries actual risks and rewards that will get your heart pumping, but WoW combat just feels so flat and dated.  I'm sure a lot of people still enjoy it, but I was just wondering what other's thought of it nowadays?  I was hoping to pick up WoW PvP like I used to in between hardcore raiding (now I play casuls lulz), but I jut couldn't do it, though I did appreciate the quick que times.   


At heart I still love WoW, and it will stay where it is for me: my de facto PvE game, as I still think WoW is the most consistent and best general PvE experience for MMO's.  At the least, it's the most polished and well-funded experience :)  Would love to hear other's thoughts.

Thanks in advance for your responses.  




 Hi all - as the title says, I just bought Witcher 2, and I have very little familiary with the plot and characters, and I was wondering if there are any must knows when it comes to the story or lore so that I won't miss too much of the 2nd game's plot?  Any recomended reading or videos before I start playing the second game?  Normally I'd be quick to play the first title in a series like this, but when the reviews say the combat/mechanics/etc are so much better and smoother in the second, it makes me want to skip the first, especially since the third is coming out right around the corner, and my gaming time is limited.  Furthermore, I ask because I don't want to risk stumbling across too many spoilers by accident, so I appreciate any directions you wticher fans may give.


Without reading too much on plot and setting, so far, the games and ideas in it sound awesome, and I was especially craving low-fantasy, dark-souls esque game play, and other than a few odd or similar titles, this seemed to fit the bill close enough.  The rest of the factions, political intrigue and backstabbery spookiness is just icing on the cake :)  Thanks in advance for your replies. 




 Hi all,


As the title says, is this game still live?  While I've never played DAOC, I've heard mostly good things over the years, and I ask because I was interested on joining to scratch my PvP itch.


That being said, how are the populations on live?  Does it require a sub?  I mean, I have no problems with a sub, but I was wondering what the differences were between live, and the emu servers?  How are the population on the emu servers?  Also, how are the populations on the emu servers?


A few more questions:  what are the different types of realms/shards on live?  Ie, PvP?  PvE?  Free for all?  That sort of thing?  How are they organized?  I've read that DAOC was 3 v 3 realm factions, but I was wondering how they further organized it.  Lastly, how does this game hold up compared to more modern games?  Is the UI/organization/etc. fairly smooth and intuitive?  I have no problem with old or aging graphics, but a clunky UI and lack of features will always be a big draw back.  Thanks in advance for your replies :) 




 Hi all.  I was watching game-play footage and reading up on Albion Online, and seeing the game made me crave some similar sort of play - that is, some sort of pvp/crafting focused exploration open world fun.  The closest game recommendation I could find in searches for similar, yet already released titles was UO.  I've known about UO a long time, I've just never played it, as back in the day I wound up on EQ, and never tried UO.


That being said, for all you UO fans out there, care to give me a brief run-down of the game?  Some must-know tips for newbs maybe?  Any in-game recommendations or hints?  In the mean-time I've been reading up on wikis and websites, but I always enjoy talking to established fans and players.


Thanks in advance for your replies :)

 




 For those of you who have been following the game and/or playing in the alpha, can anyone deny or confirm if this statement is accurate or not?  Of course I don't mean that I expect it to be exactly the same as EVE, but what about a fairly close approximation?

I mean - from equipment slots being filled with abilities just like mod slots give you abilities in Eve, to the devs trying to control RMT, to the 'you are your equipment' (in eve, your ship=you), to the security statuses of green, yellow, and red, to controlling territory, to losing your gear on death, it all seems pretty similar.

So far from what I've read and looked up, it seems like an awesome idea, and I'm sort of excited, but at the same time, it is also sort of horrifying.  If let's say, resource collecting is as boring as it is in EVE with mining (target rocks, turn on lasers, move, ship, store, compress, bring haulers, etc) or needing to multi/cheat box 16 accounts to truly get anywhere, then it loses a lot of its appeal.  Or let's say with grouping and fleets, if combat is as simple as being an F1 monkey like it is in EVE medium to large fleets (ie, you target who you're supposed to, turn on damage, and that's the fight), or any other number of quirks like that, it just seems like it would be boring, redundant, and, uh... not fun?


I mean, I've been playing EVE for a long time, but I mostly play to spend time with my brothers.  We only do PVP in a large null-sec alliance.  But even with the focus being combat, honestly, I don't feel like I'm playing a game with EVE - I feel like I'm tooling around and manipulating old, simple mechanics that resemble a game.  Ie, I feel like I'm just playing with the bones of a game, not the actual flesh and blood of it.  I enjoy it, to a point, but also, even with blowing up big spaceships and ruining many people's days, it's still kinda boring.


Anyway, those are my ruminations.  Just wondering what people think so far.  Thanks in advance for your time and responses. 




 Hi all - As the title says says, do you get the resources you used building buildings back in any way shape or form when you remove or replace them in your garrison?  I googled it in various ways but never found a straight answer.  Thanks in advance for your response. 




 Hi all.

As the title of the post says, I have questions on armor. Specifically, I know equipping an armor set is based on secondary stats, but is there a quick way to tell how much of your stats an armor piece uses?


I was taking armor pieces on and off while looking at the stat sheet and I noticed the stats going up and down, but is there an easier way to keep track of it?  Or a way to hell how many stats total a piece of armor or full set uses?


Also, aside doctor buffs, are there other ways to increase those secondary stats?  What about the reallocation (or whatever its called) option?  How does that work?


As far as HAM goes, I noticed things die when one of the 3 bars runs out, so does that essentially mean you're only as good as your weakest ham bar?  And with the different consumption levels of HAM from abilities, and enemies doing damage to different bars, is there an easy way to track this?  I noticed my abilities seem to drain different HAM numbers on enemie - does that occur based on the weapon I use or from the abilities themselves?  (Ie., basic attack or overshot with a rifle, or regular attack and 2h lunge attack with a heavy axe)


right now a lot of this stuff seems pretty arbitrary and nonsensical to me, so any clarity would be appreciated. Thanks in advance for your replies :) 




 Hi all.

Whether or not you played the original Warhammer Online Age of Reckoning (which closed down in 2013), I'm curious if anyone here has played or plays on the private server?


http://www.returnofreckoning.com/about.php

I never had a chance to play the original game, but I plan on registering/setting it up the emu soon, and I was just wondering if anyone had some opinions or tips or ideas to offer up on the private server.  Specifically, how is balance between the two factions?  How is the game play in general?  That sort of thing.  As it stands, I know they are still ironing it out quite a bit and working on bugs and stuff, but so it goes for private servers.  Thanks in advance for your replies 




 Hello all,

I've just reinstalled MW4 Mercs on my newer Win 8.1 machine, and just like my old machine on windows 7, it's been working great.  

The only problem is in the title of this post - any changes I make in the MW4 config ap don't seem to save.  Does anyone have any suggestions or know a fix for this?  Thanks in advance for your replies. 




 Seriously.  I don't know what it is about this game that sees that a good portion of the time your retarded pickup group loses terribly back to back, but I can't take much more of this (some things have not changed since beta).  In short I'm looking for people who are at least as competent as a pickle or a jar of mayonnaise, who are looking for other players to group with.  I'm on Pacific Standard time (CA, USA). 

Drop me a line here on Reddit or in game.  My IGN is Balcombe. 




 Ok - not to repeat what anyone else has said because I've searched it many times over, but is this UI really what were left with?  I mean, it seems so piss-poor that it's hard to believe, so please understand tht I make this thread just to make sure I'm not missing anything:

So I log in last night for the first time in a year, and I didn't even get a chance to play because I spent about 2-3 stupid OCD hours after a years worth of patching sorting trough mechs, trying to find parts, figuring the terrible UI out until I stripped all my mechs, called it a night, and went to bed. 


Now. I've tried a buncha searches to see if there was a fix or if I broke something, but it seems this new UI was put out nearly a year ago, and almost immediately the MWO forum blew up with players talking about how terrible it was to use and how it made te gaming experience a shit-show. Anyway. That was a lot of complaints from a lot of people almost a year ago, and it's still there?  So that means some dip-shit at PGI saw all that, experienced what a piece of crap the UI was, and somehow said, "it's acceptable. Working as intended."


I mean, I ask because, WTF?  I checked the patch notes today, stupidly thinking it would say the UI is fixed, but I guess to them there is nothing to fix?  Thanks in advance for your replies.  




 Anyone know of good current or in-development games that are what MWO should have been?  I play Hawken here and there as a sort of filler for FPS meeting mech action, but that is more FPS/twitch based, and it lacks the ideal of a mech game:  
the mechlab/strategybrawling and twitch combat (though the brawling should fill its niche in there somewhere).  I looked into perpetum, both good and bad reviews, and it is too reminiscent of Eve, which I already play, and I refuse to try to get into another game like that.  Eve can be brutal and time consuming enough.  Essentially, I want to play MWO, just not the MWO that has been derped and rederped.  Anyone have any suggestions?  Anything with a solid mech/lab, decent options for builds and chassis, etc, that doesn't gate so much of the piddly amount of new content for absurd real money prices?  I mean, cash-shops are fine, but not how MWO has done it:  how many hundreds of dollars do they want to keep asking for a sub-par game before the diehard battletech fans kick in their monitors and quit the game?


I don't say these things to continue what I see as a fairly justified bitch-fest about the state of MWO, but from the bigger picture, that MWO is that crack-baby that was dropped on its head too many times and wound up in foster care and the only people willing to adopt it also abuse it.  Us long-time fans want to love it, but it's lacking in so many ways, and in the mean time PGI is golding the IP hostage, never mind the fact that us founders got screwed, the dev process has been clunky and slow, and PGI has more than bled the community dry in constant, shameless, bull-shit cash-grabs, and continues to do so.


Anyway - I say all this to give you an idea of the game I'm looking to play.  I don't mind in game cash-shops, so long as it doesn't gate content, specifically when that content is minimal.  A little bit of pay to sparkle or even p2w is fine.  I'd prefer a nice mix of strategy and twitch, and I'd prefer there be giant, powerful, robots smashing each other into oblivion.  Bonus points if the robots actually take skill, patience, and attention to drive.

Cheers, and thanks in advance for your responses. 




 As the title says, for crystal use purposes, what are BAMs considered?  Boss monsters or regular monsters?


That being said, does anyone have a good, up-to-date guide for leveling up via mob grinding?  I google searched it, but a lot of the information I'm finding seems out of date or changed.  If anyone could provide a link or put up a quick list of optimum mobs/locations to grind, I'd appreciate it.  Thanks in advance for your replies. 




 Hi all.  I just started playing the game and I am thoroughly enjoying my first few hours.

I'm writing this post to see if there is anyone available to join me.  I started a warrior (named Heavy.Meddles) and a sorcerer (Balcombe), and I'm having a hell of a time trying to decide which one to main because they are both fun to play so far.

Drop me a line here or in game if you'd like to level/group with me.

Thanks. 




 Hi Everybody,

As the title says, I haven't played since 2011 or so, and I was just wondering what some of the major changes were, as I have been looking at playing the game some more.  When I left the game, my main was a level 50ish (I don't remember exactly) magician (or whatever they are called), as well as a mid level assassin and warrior (or whatever they were called).

And yes, while I have been looking/googling this stuff a little bit at a time, I also figured why not ask the friendly reddit people for a more concise answer, especially to a few specific questions:

1.  I left a little while after they released the kromede/judge and lower level solo missions.  What are the major game/class/etc changes since then?

2.  PvP was fun - the abyss being one of the primary hunting grounds - are the PvP battles still hearty and large scale and super laggy?  Also, being that it is a korean MMO - while the PvP gear was good, it was also an insane grind (just like the PvE gear) to get any of it.  Is this still the case?  I mean, I don't need or want gear to be handed to me, but korean farm-style playing is madness!  Has this changed for the better?

3.  Is the game still PvP centric in general?  What are the primary servers, and how is the balance on them?

4.  Offhand, I can't remember if you paid straight kinah to reskin items, or if you just bought a consumable.  How is reskinning/wardrobe handled nowadays?

5.  How about the Classes/Professions or whatever they are called?  Any one care to give me a quick run down?  Ie, "PvP is dominated by so-and-so, so-and-so massive DPS OP, so-and-so massive under powered, so-and-so is a joke, etc"

6.  How is the economy?  As usual, I remember this MMO being dominated by gold-sellers and bots, everything was super pricey, and kinah was slow to grind, making everything a PITA.  Has this changed for the better?  Is it more stable?  Still bot dominated?  Etc?

Thanks in advance for your replies.

 Hi.  As the title says, PC, top tier SM bracket in NG+ looking to trade my rampart golem armor/helm for a pair of rampart golem gloves.  Will be around for a few hours tonight, and maybe tomorrow night.  Drop me a line if you're interested.  Thank you.

P.S. - I tired posting this in r/wheelanddeal but I kept getting error messages 




 This conversation came up within a post of this subreddit, so I wanted to ask the DS community at large what their suggestions are when it comes to finding other games that are challenging and intriguing enough to play through, ie., games that raise the bar like the Souls series, or at least, games that don't feel too easy or stale, especially when compared to the Souls franchise.  While I know this isn't directly DaS2 per se, I feel it is in good taste, and could help other people find new and fun games to play as well.  I'm a PC gamer, but I do plan on getting a PS4 in the months to come for Bloodborne, but any system suggestions are welcome, as other people can benefit.


Point is, while there are many fun games out there, few have the risk and reward factors, immersion, compelling and mysterious stories, lore, and fun gameplay wrapped together as well as the Souls series does.  I'm not necessarily looking for Souls clones, or games that are even in the same fantasy genre or share similar combat systems, but just other well balanced, challenging games.  Worth noting, other than saying DaS2 is a better RPG game, but DaS is a better Souls game, I'm leaving out critique on DaS and DaS2 for this post, mainly focusing on what makes them fun and challenging games.


While I'm open to any game, regardless of reviews and opinions, to help narrow it down, I can add a few critiques or reviews of other noteworthy games and series:


Morrowwind, Oblivion, Skyrim, that series:  Fun, to a point, often redundant, repetitive, weaker combat/magic systems, worth their dollar value in entertainment, but the stories and characters were never compelling enough that I ever finished a single game, even after logging 60-100+ hours on some.


MMO's:  Honestly, most of them have terrible writing, bad stories, stale gameplay, and very few innovations.  They often lack any weight, and feel like button mashing with little to no immersion.  Thus they wind up repetitive grinds, even if some of the character, boss, and level design is well rendered.  The treadmill just gets old, and this comes from an old Ultima/EQ/WoW (played WC since WC1, had to know what happened in the story, etc.


Legend of Grimrock:  Right up my alley.  I love old-school dungeon crawlers - for the challenges in puzzles and combat, the change of pace, as well as nostalgia.  Graphics aint everything.  I have been members of Dungeon Master/Chaos Strikes Back/related games and clones communities, and have many user-made dungeons and other emulators and remakes for these types of games.


Dead Space:  Overall, this is my favorite shooter/survivor horror game in recent years.  Great story, great characters, lots of twists and turns, well-written, scary and immersive, and somewhat innovative, or at least, had some noteworthy differences.  Loved that your character was a crafty engineer rather than a soldier.  You used mining tools for weapons!  Was great!


Dragon Age Origins:  Was a great game at the time.  Was definitely immersive, as the characters were cheeky and well-written, the voice acting was good, and the world had some great lore, even if the tropes are old as writing itself.  Looking back, the combat was kinda meh, if somewhat strategic at times, and the levels seem pretty small and thus the game limited, but still a memorable game.  I never bothered with the second, as I was bored within a minute of the demo.


Mass Effect:  While I enjoyed the first and second, by the time I got to the third just this last month or two (yeah, I was late to the party), I dunno, the game just felt stale and limited and so easy, even on the highest difficulties.  The levels and areas to explore just seemed so simple and rehearsed, and at times it just feels like the AI/system is playing the game for me.  While the series was intriguing enough for the first two games, after being ruined by the souls series, now it just seems boring and redundant.



Anyway, all that being said, I'm up for all and any suggestions, preferably with the elements of good writing, fun/challenging gameplay, immersion, and better risk/reward systems.  Saving and reloading constantly definitely diminishes this, but I look forward to what you guys have to say.  Thanks in advance. 




 Hello everyone.  While I know there have already been speculative posts on this reddit about the title question, can anyone confirm or deny if any of the higher-ups at Sony/From/Miyazaki/etc. have either confirmed, denied or even given a maybe on whether or not there will be a Bloodborne bundle?  I've searched the web, but no dice so far.



I ask because, if so, I would like to wait for the bundle, rather than pre-ordering the deluxe edition Bloodborne early, as well as a PS4 separately.  Thanks in advance for your replies. 




 Well, if I had to title this story, it would be, "Guess how many times I died during the tutorial?"  Psshaw, none at all.  That would be pathetic, amirite, or amirite!?

So what started out as a perfect no death chievo run for the first three minutes ended abruptly in Things Betwixt when I derped off the edge of a cliff.  I said, "you know what death, not today."  I then died 2 minutes later when I missed a plunging attack and took an arrow in the ass.  After being defeated by the tutorial, I headed on my to Majula, to ya know, kick rocks and mope around with the rest of the bipolar twits.

After losing my left testicle to one of the piglets, I went forth to brave the forest of the fallen giants.  At this point, my girlfriend started talking at me.  I love her to death, but man she can talk.  I nodded, and I said "uh huh, uh huh, yeah" and then I died.  She kept talking.  And then I died again.  Then I realized I love her, but I don't love her to death, and I got mad at her, and I told her, "not now, you can fill my ear holes with words later!," and that's when she got mad at me, so I took a break from the game to grovel and kiss her ass and apologize.  I told her to stay away from me for the next week or two as I would be very angry.  Very, very angry.  Lots of cursing to ensue....


Ahem, so, anyway, I resume braving the forest of fallen giants with a crossbow in my left hand, a mace in my right hand, and an imported sack over my head to hide my hollowed shame.  I die a few more times  whilst slapping around various zombies and meth addicts, and finally I make it to the last giant.  Speaking of which, did you ever think what a liar he is?  There are quite a few more giants in Black Gulch, and they exist in memories at the least, so fuck you Last Giant, you lying liar.  What else are you lying about?!  Ehrm, anyway, I take him down on the first go, and he died like a punk with no integrity what so ever.  Having a surplus of souls I buy a zillion wooden bolts to slay hookers and vampires from a distance, and with my spirits renewed, I zip over to Heide's tower to go toe to toe with the dragon rider.  I run past all the enemies and bum rush the fog gate.  I was going to duke it with him like a man, cuz I'm a man like that - always working on cars and bench-pressing saber-tooth tigers like a man, but somehow, mysteriously, by no plan of my own, the dragon rider took exactly six steps forward and raised his mighty halberd at me.  I'm no fool, so I dodge right as he lunges forward, and whaddayaknow, the clumsy bastard fell off the edge of the arena and died like a derp!  I was going to raise the edges of the platform so we could spar, but I, uh, just forgot.  Anyway, that is where I paused my adventure so far.  Tonight I plan on going back for fake Ornstein, because ya know, I hate liars.  One more baddie to die in poverty and shame!  I got your number fake Ornstein!


Anyway, after working on various DaS level 1 runs, I gotta say, while easier so far in some ways than DaS 1Broing, the worst of it has been learning the sweet spot on the pitiful dodge roll.  Even at well under 50%, there are like what, negative two i-frames?  I swear, compared to the fast roll of DaS, or the ninja-WTF-flipping, I feel like an obese shut-in with no cartridge in his knees.  Learning to dodge as such has a much steeper curve - especially since my onebro seems to purposefully roll into every arrow that is shot at him.


That being said, stay tuned for more adventures of a DS2 OneBro!   




 After taking a break from Dark Souls 2 I returned to Dark Souls and created a Paladin character. 

I found myself in Anor Londo, stuck at the infamous silver knight archer gauntlet, and while I've had melee characters have little trouble with that part before, for some reason, I just couldn't get past it.  I prolly lost 50k souls total and lots of humanity at this point,  and after dying countless times (like 12 times, but I can't count that high), I die another 5 times, and finally, on like, the 20th try, I dash up that small span one final time, and there in the middle of it is a black vagabond!

I panic because I've never seen one, and I wanna know what's inside it, but I also know I'm in the worst position ever.  He shoots a homing soul mass type projectile right over me, and by the time I realize, "hey, it's the most rare enemy in the game, i wanna kill it for lootz!" and try to swing my sword, he swings his pincer and one shots me, and a second later the dragon arrows start  raining down on my body.  That was the first and only time I've seen a black vagabond to date.  I think I remember seeing a red one, but that was a year or two ago.

Anyway.  At that point, after dying 1,745 times at that spot, and finally to the black vagabond, my hatred turned to laughter, and after briefly contemplating suicide, I finally got past the silver knights.  Sadly, I have yet to see that little black bastard since then.

With that story out of the way, what is your most memorable death?  Also, has anyone killed a black vagabond?  If so, what did it drop?  With how bad-ass they are, it's gotta be the cure for cancer, or an autographed picture of Jesus!  What say you?

-One of the best Simpsons quotes ever, 




 You're welcome on the info thing.

Well, neither of those games play like bloodborne, and most games don't in either style, mechanics, or lore and story-telling, but they have their similarities and are quite different.  Dead Space 1 and 2 are solid survival horror games.  They follow mysterious plotlines that you have to fit together and are slowly revealed, yet even then mysterious, leaving you with many questions.  Also, the game-play is similar to Dark Souls in that it is a bit more slow and plodding and thoughtful, and it can be challenging, especially on higher difficulties, though it is standard load/save type method of doing things.


Darkest dungeon is a RNG party-based dungeon crawling game, where you recruit characters who die permanent deaths, focus on party comps and smart item usage and upgrades of your town hub, characters and armor, and it is pretty similar to the Cthulu mythos of crazed cults and mysterious dark portals and Eldritch truth.


A few others are Salt and Sanctuary - an upcoming 2d souls type game yet to be released, and Lords of The Fallen is a similar DaS style game (die and leavebloodstains, lose all your currency, focus on builds and weighty combat) was released last fall, and even though it isn't anywhere as good as DaS/BB, it is still one of the only directly DaS inspired games out there.  And of course, there are the Original Souls - Demon Souls, DaS and Das2, all worth playing, even though they are similar yet quite different from Bloodborne.


Edit:  Some other good 2D souls like games (death has consequences, risk vs reward, etc) are Rogue Legacy and Shovel Knight. 




 Right, but it depends on weapon scaling and stat investments as well, and the point remains, that there is only one in main game play through, and it sucks having to run hours of chalice dungeons or run to a whole new playthrough if you don't pick it up. 




 Takes a lot of patience - you can't get greedy or you will be killed in one shot.  I stayed at range, baiting out his charge attack (turns into a leap later on, so it changes the timing of when you have to dodge), which is easy to dodge once you know the tells and the timing, or his vomit (which he hardly ever did for me ). 


 If he vomits, and you can get to him quickly, whack his legs 3 times, and it will stun him for a moment, but make sure you don't get too greedy.


When he charges, dodge to the right and behind him, and either do one running or quick attack, and back away/dodge again, as he will quickly retaliate.  With the axe (what I think I was using), I could only get off one attack or risk being killed.


I've fought him in his weaker versions more head on which was easy, but that is the strategy I used to beat him, as I wasn't doing so hot facing him head on, as a lot of times he would charge at me even if I was close to him, and I hardly had the time or room to dodge, and it just complicated the fight too much for me, though in his last phase he hardly would want to charge me at all, so I did some very hesitant, scared shitless face-to-face combat, but I wasn't happy about it :D 




 Dude.  That shit totally reminds me of full-metal alechemist and the creation of a philosopher's stone.  All you need is a large number of hapless, terrifies souls to complete the ritual create it :D


Edit:  And the other ones who didn't get turned to stone were turned into giant lumpy, human flesh-ipedes! 




 Nope.  I don't like the blunderbuss or the cane, but the pistol is awesome and easy to parry with.  Maybe you should mix up your weapon useage and play style?  As much as I enjoy(ed) the plodding, strategic combat of DaS, I definitely think FROM did right with a change, and I find BB infinitely more fun, fluid, intense, and enjoyable when it comes to combat mechanics.  I love DaS, but BB has been a step in the right direction in terms of actual gameplay, though of course it could use more weapons and armor and etc. 




 I'm gonna be sure to leave notes in front of all the dolls and ladders now :D 




 I try to update my cloud save files like, every other day, especially if I make a lot of progress.  Don't know if PS4 automatically does this by default.  Can anyone confirm?  Either way, definately worth doing it manually every now and again to be sure, and also back it up on a USB drive maybe once every few weeks or once a month, that way, you're never totally screwed. 




 There is one blood rock you can get in the main game, and I suggest you get it before you kill gherman and get booted to NG+, as then you will miss out on it, and they are very hard to come by.  NG+ doubles everyone's hp, so a +10 weapon can definitely help you feel like you are fighting with something more than a limp bread stick :D 




 Cool, glad you took that as I intended it to be read, even though I perhaps sounded a bit dick-ish at parts.  Definately.  I liked how you bowed in the first match, even in the midst of his onslaught (also annoying that you can't cancel emotes as quickly in this game), and then you proceeded to beat him in a close match.  And cheers to older etiquete, I just find it amusing when people get mad that people don't act as they insist.  Wish this game had something more implied like red sign soap stones and arenas :/ 




 Ehh, Squid headed Cthulu-esque monsters are always a visiual cue, but often it involves eldritch (sinister/ghostly) type of truths that induce madness, and that somehow bring to light the limitations of humanity and our perceptions and understanding.  Two come readily to mind:


A newer game called Darkest Dungeon on Steam (awesome by the way, and brutal like souls/BB) is heavily influenced by Lovecraft.  Hell, even a game like deadspace (all about evolution, taking humanity to the next level based on this "alien" artifact that induces a madness that believers see as truth and growth) is very Lovecraftian, even though there aren't squid-headed monsters in it. 




 Dude, you don't even want to know it!  The Eldritch Truth will drive you mad!  MAD I SAY!!!!1! 




 Not passive aggressive, I just wanted to crush his moment of triumph and  give him a heads up that it only gets worse :) 




 Yeah - a lot of Lovecraft's focus was psychological, that is, fear of the unknown, and the limitations of human comprehension, hence so much of the focus of the game is about insight, and understanding the sinister truth and perception.  Ie., can you think of a five-sided triangle?  Or absolute zero, or nothingness?  Such things might exist, but they are truly beyond us being our comprehension. 




 You do know that's not the blood letting beast that everyone has the hardest time with, right?  :P


Nice work though! 




 Dude got wreckt, and that's cool, but why would yo ube so solipsistic in the first place?  Does everyone have to play by your rules or even the community's rules either in a game, or outside in the real world?  That shit can get you killed there too :D  Also, there's something to appreciate in how that dude just ran at you all aggressive as fuck, just like the hunter NPCs, no bull-shitting around.  None of the other hostile hunters in the game stop to bow and have tea and crumpets with you bdefore starting a fight, so why should he?


Have done lots of PvP in souls games, and honestly, who gives a shit about it in BB?  It's not like we placed down red or black soap stone signs to duel, and it's not like it's hard to inflict damage. Fighting is so fast-paced, and there are so many items and weapons to utilize for fun, that both people can use, why try and put the same honor code here?  With how long it can take to even get matches, I appreciate the longer and more drawn-out fights, so long as the invaders aren't hiding in a group of NPCs, or totally shitting on both of our time in one way or another.  Don't mean to sound like a dick, but I'm sick of people complaining about this shit or other arbitrary PvP rules, especially since BB is not the same as the Souls games, and it's the perfect game to play a sleaze ball, and use all the dirty tricks in the book, and to have fun with some intense fights, and I think putting restrictions on such a game are just limiting the full experience of the PvP  :D 




 Would it upset you if I told you I killed this guy on my level 4 beastbro run?  That poison is no joke with low vitality :D  Here are some tips.


You can parry him (when he extends his arm all the way back, pretty much as he is just shooting it forward, pow, parry+visceral.)


Save a firepaper, and your oil urns and molotov cocktails for the last phase so you can stay away from the poison, and kill him ASAP.


As others have said, if you stay to his right side, locked on, always ready to dodge, he will never hit you, but again, that poison can be brutal in that last phase.

 




 Don't they aren't definitely afraid of anything? 




 PSA:  You can use the beast claw to deflect objects, including fireballs, bullets, and even the giant rocks those fuckers throw.  You can thank me later :D 




 Plz make a bloodborne movie Disney!  PLZ! 




 Eh, but same thing goes for the rest of the souls games as well.  See Onebros :D 




 Was about to say, if you kill Rom before Amelia, it can bug out your game... 




 I know right?  Dude should get a room if he is gonna be spamming his bone, then he has the nerve to come at you before he even washes his hands?!  What an asshole! 




 Yeah, but the axe does group damage and crowd constrol so much better and easier, and somehow it's even quicker and more versatile.  You think they would have made the whip at least a bit quicker :/ 




 So what if you have deft little delicate hotdogs for fingers?  How do you have the strength to punch your hand trough a pig's ass and rip out its intestines?! 




 Can you confirm that guide/dlc thing? 




 That sounds like a fun fight.  I actually was sort of miffed by hemwick my first time through.  I mean, it was super easy, but it was sort of quiet and I didn't know what the fuck was goin on, in an anti-climactic sort of way.  Then I realized there was a little barnacle covered toad lady you had to whack, then another one, then she was dead and it was easy and I was like, how does this shit fit into the story?  0_o 




 Hahahaha.  Thanks for sharing. 




 I totally enjoy onebro runs or limited items/weapons and other challenge runs, but the tedium and insanity of barehanded and guitar hero controllers just sounds maddening!  I can already feel the frenzy meter rising just thinking about it, feeling a bit sick, but at least I can die human.... rooooAAARRr scREEEACH BLARRRRGHHHeeEeeeeRRRRRRRR RAOOOR! 




 And all those heavy trade-offs are why it's obnoxious that people even bitch and moan about in-game mechanics, items, and weapons that are clearly meant to be used, especially in PvP :D 




 Yeah, how dare people use in game items and weapons and intended mechanics.  From here on out, you are not allowed to use the rally system either!  Rally system is total CHEEZ mode!!1! 




 I'd defeat him with the sprint button :P

Last time I bothered to kill one of those assholes as a regular dungeon mob, he only dropped a bent paper-clip or something stupid like that :/ 




 Is there a cannon armed undead giant surrounded by dogs and undead with a bellmaiden nearby dropping spiders on your face?  That one has been, my, uh, favorite one so far... 




 I wear it with the crowfeather garb, as the black feathers on the bone ash set better matches the crowfeather jacket.  Looks pretty sick.  The whole vibe is a nice angel of death one :D 




 Also a heads up - make sure you run it blind with no spoilers/help/etc., as, yes, the level design is awesome, but it also hides how short and straight-forward the game truly is :/ 




 Goddammit lock ness monstah, I dun told you I aint givin you no tree'fiddy! 




 Eh, say what you will, but Dark Souls 2 was still the best game of 2014, and still gave FROM fans a bajillion hours of entertainment for both PvE and PvP, and still had the best fashion souls and PvP to date of the whole series.  BB would be closer, if not for the lousy match-making and load times and lack of multi-player options and covenants. 




 What you're describing is Dead Space, almost :D 




 U stoopid newb got reckt!

Just kidding :D

Yeah, if only we did something more useful with some of our spare time...man, the amount of souls knowledge and trivia up there is the reason I can't remember people's names anymore :) 




 That wasn't just you.  That was everyone.  DaS PvP was an economy of backstabs, and a lot of lag :D 




 There are covenants in this game?  :D 




 Being human itself allowed summons, bonfire kindling, etc, and also raised your resistances, and the humanity stat itself also increased your item discovery, aside the other affects of AR for certain weapons of ETC.


Point is, I had that thought as well (about insight doing more or being linked to idiscovery), but it would need a better balance.  In general, insight needs more of a purpose in game... 




 And then you join scientology, and they take all your echoes in tax-deductible donations, and the brain-sucker slurps out all your intelligence and free will!  Totally spot on! 




 dON'T GIVE UP SKELETON! 




 Well, I like the idea, and it would balance out since not everyone levels arcane (and honestly, the wizard stuff equivelant in this game is kinda lame anyhow, even for some extra utility and damage), but it would need to be balanced more though - like how in DaS1, your humanity raised your Idiscovery, but you risked losing it if you died... 




 Yeah, my level 4 beastbro is kickin ass and he's half way through the main game, and its pretty much like playing the whole game ond defiled cursed chalice dungeon mode, since a lot of late game enemies and most bosses kill you in one or two hits.  My main who I just like to derp around with is around level 200 or so, so who knows why the fuck he sounds so self-righteous and upset.  What else is my main supposed to do after easily aquiring all items?  Just sit on top of 2 million souls?  Nah, spend that shit.  


The most important part of a build is focus, and then the skill to use it, and a few extra levels (even 50 of them) hardly make a difference.  Anything past a level 100-120 specialized build doesn't necessarily make the game any easier anyhow, as most Bosses can still kill you in one or two hits, and the small damage bonuses are negligible, especially since an extra 10% damage doesn't mean much on a swing, when an enemy will still take two whole swings to kill anyhow. 




 Yeah, at depth 5 chalices and NG++, I find my main wandering around with a million souls fairly easily, so I've just been pumping his levels up.  Almost level 200 on him.


I have a level 4 beastbro who I will never level, and I'm also working on two separate builds I'll keep in co-op and pvp ranges.


Edit:  Also, with how wonky multiplayer is, and how tough certain chalices are, I can safely say I miss soul memory  :P 




 And the rent is too damn high!  Wait, what...? 




 Dude.  I tried the cane last night on a new character, and I got my ass handed to me over and over again at beginning of the game, and I'm in NG++ on other toons, have beaten all the lowest depth chalices, and I even am working on a Onebro challenge run.  Sure, I don't know how to play as effectively with the cane yet, but even then, the weapon just seems so lacking, namely in whip mode.  My level 4 beastbro kicks far more ass with a hunter's axe than my canebro, and onebro is in the forbidden forest, fighting much tougher enemies.  Cane just seems so whimpy, slow, and lacks damage on its whip attacks, as they have a ridiculously long wind up time, yet don't do as much damage as the kick-ass hunter's axe halberd version, nor do they stun as easily it seems.  Am I missing something here?  Or does the cane sort of suck, namely compared to other weapons that do both 1h and 2h modes better in general? 




 Right, and this is all the more reason why they need to focus and fix those issues sooner rather than later, and we know their is a match coming on the 23rd, though I don't know if that is the announced one to supposedly optimize multi-player.  I agree with a lot of your other ideas, but game balances like that can be tweaked later, after we're done yelling "Rabble rabble rabble!" about the critical-mass multi-player problems  :D


You made a good write up though.


Edit:  Also, 2nd most important, is we need covenants that matter, covenants that carry some fun interaction, risks, and rewards.  As it stands, covenants are lame as fuck and pointless in this game :( 




 I love this game, 9/10 rating from me, but there are a few huge problems in it at the moment, and they are brutally critical for a FROM game, and they definitely threaten the longevity and replayability of Bloodborne.  The biggest problems imo at the moment are the invasion system/mechanics, lack of covenants and covenant interactions/rewards, lack of even duels or an arena type system, and the wonky, undependable multi-player system in general.

Invasions - This game needs more invasions, in more areas, even if the boss is dead.  This game was not as exciting as previous titles, as there was far less risk due to a lack of player invaders.  I think bell maidens should spawn in pretty much almost every area of the game, and they should also still spawn after the boss is dead.  *I'm not even a fan of invading or invaders, but I still enjoy the mechanic, because it creates even more of a threat, and adds another delicious layer of fear, precaution, and excitement.*  I myself much prefer soapstones for dueling and arenas, and on that note:


There needs to be better, non-penalized dueling systems (ie, no -30% health penalty).  There should be bells for even-matched duels and fight clubs, as well as an arena system implemented.



Multi-player in general needs to be better, faster connections, less time-outs, and insight should not be consumed until a match is found and you are actually placed in another's player world.


There needs to be covenants in this game, along with all the risks and rewards of being in them.  Oh, there are covenants in this game?  You could have fooled me!  :D


Those are my biggest gripes for now, never mind any of the other critiques.  Still give the game a 9/10 because it is a fantastic game, but the issues that are there for the moment are very fucking glaring and unforgivable in a game like this.  I almost want to say, FROM could have or should have known and done better :(



Edit:  And yes I agree - frenzy is a goofy ass mechanic that needs some tweaking.  Bleed was cool and functional in DaS, negligble and useless in DaS2, and the equivelant in BB is just OP and WTF and kind of stupid...

 




 I don't know why a bunch of random assholes are downvoting you for no apparent reason, but you're right, it's definitely more fun than a heart attack, but not as fun as say, an aneurysm  :D 




 Create a level 4 beastbro for a challenge run?  Or some other type of chalice run?  That's the only other thing at the moment, other than what you mentioned and playing more NG cycles...  or, maybe trying new builds, or something besides quality/ludwig's.


That being said, hopefully they patch multiplayer soon...


other than what you mentionedLevel than what you mentioned and NG cycles and more chalice dungeons... 




 Yeah.  I think that's a pretty dumb way of calculating damage for viscerals... 




 How would you redo the character?  I mean, don't get me wrong. To really go for it ya really gotta use everything in your arsenal, and sometimes it's the environment, so no biggie there.  




 No summons for a true beastbro run for some, but the true deciding factor is not leveling. I managed to get Amelia on my second go, but I burned up my last 3 fire papers and used a few molotovs as well, as well as 10-15 blood vials. I'm currently getting destroyed in forbidden woods. The dogs just fart in my direction and my HP melts. Just lost 70k souls too, which is a lot. After amelia though, id recomend going to cainhurst ASAP to get blood chunks. You can at least get your weapon up to +7 or 8 if you're lucky. 


That being said, if you're around to night, I'd be willing to help u with Amelia in true Beastbro fashion, that way some higher level isn't doing the wimping for you. Let me know.  




 Yo dawg, I heard you like dreams, so we put dreams in a dream, so you could dream that your dreaming while you're dreaming about dreaming. 




 You cheesed him behind the graves and objects though :|


If we're bragging here, I beat him in one go on my first attempt with my level 4 Beastbro.  No, it was not gracious, as I had to do a lot of running and dodging in the last phase, but yes - most of his attacks will still kill you in a one to three hits with a level 4 at 10 vitality too, but don't worry, all enemies and bosses will be killing you with one shot later on in the game. 




 Welcome to Camera Souls, where the most difficult enemy you will ever fight is the camera, and he follows you into every boss battle!


(Seriously though, the camera has always been an issue in these games) 




 So this was right before he beat you to a bloody pulp with his sack of dead hookers, huh? 




 Uh, I thought Yharnam sprang up on top of the labrynth - as a result of blood healing and the further experiments with the splits in the school of thoughts from Byrgenwyrth?  Ie., Yharnam came to exist and thrive because of the blood, rather than being incidentally infected with it?
 




 Dude, after several playthroughs with a dozen other toons, for whatever reason, my mage could not make it up that one arch with the two silver archers shooting him for the life of me!  And the last time I tried, a fucking black vagrant spawned right in the middle of the arch, blocking the path, and it proceeded to 1-shot me!  Good times! 




 Well, I think the weapons they do have are pretty great, and I'd take one or two unique weapons over a whole table of 20 axes that are virtually the same (aside fashion, of course), but still, give us a few more chunks and/or rocks in each play through or whatever so we can at least play around more with the few weapons that are there :D 




 Dude.  She plays it like she's one tough crow, but really she is a super sensitive softy and she's super pissed that you didn't talk to her when she was leaning against that fence that one time... 




 Or just run straight through it all :D 




 Well. What about the 3 dozen or so baby great ones up near the upper ward and orphanage?  They all are drawn to where Ebriatis is - seemingly pining to get back to what is possibly their mother. 


Edit:  or are those Kin babies?  Like a precursor?  Because as a baby squid genuinr great one, we look muh different than the models used as ariannas baby. 


Also. By true ending they mean it is the only ending in which you truly transcend the hunt. The other two endings have u repeat it in some capacity. 
 




 Did you kill Ron the funky caterpillar?  It so, you are blocked temporarily from going back there.  




 Thanks. It's a bummer to hear they made experimentation harder in this game. Shit, I'd rather get blood stone chunks instead of mad men's knowledge :/ 




 You bet. I'm looking forward to it. Also, did you hear that they might be turning it into a movie? 




 For the chalice dungeons?  Yeah. I found a lot of the info on the spread sheets to be inaccurate or incomplete:  one dungeon had an extra rune in it, and another one said the blood rock is on level 2, but it was really on level 3. 


Or, do you mean you've found blood rocks in  each of the dungeons, and now when you try to go to a different glyph dungeon with a bloodrock supposedly inside, you find he madmen's knowledge in its stead? 




 Haha.  I'm sort of in the same boat.  I bought the PS4 as an Xmas present for myself, then played destiny for a few hours before I quit because it was a totally shit game, but then I got into the last of us, played it on and off for a few weeks, and I haven't picked it up since.  I was just thinking recently, *"I should go to youtube and finish up the rest of the story,"* as I tend to agree with you - shooters with controllers suck, and as fun as those sort of mechanics are in general, I tend to tire of them pretty quickly.  Sure, it's kinda fun to stealth around and bash peoples heads in and fight off zombies, for a bit, but then it just starts feeling redundant, and now that BB is out, I don't see myself going back to finish the game.  I'll definitely look up the rest of the story soon! 




 I took out the master race thing, and just put "PC gamer."  It's not about being better than, but if I can play a game on a machine that performs and displays the game better, I will at every chance I can get, which means I will always choose a PC unless the game is an exclusive like BB.  As for the achievements, again, I personally don't care or see the importance unless it's a challenge run (again, for the fun of the challenge, not the badge), or unless it unlocks more content or in-game items. 




 Have you played the last of us?  It's the only other game with it for PS4 (dice it's exclusive). Definitely a solid story game, a once in a generation type experience.  




 Are you a PC gamer?  If so, that is probably why :P


I'm a PC gamer myself, so I don't get the point of it either. The only reason I really see achievements mattering is when it actually unlocks more content or gives ou ingame rewards :D


Edit: I totally get challenge runs and stuff like that, but there aren't any Cheevos in BB for completing those. They're just little badges saying you completed parts of the main PvE game.  




 Do you need red jelly?  It unlocks as a purchasable item in the insight store, but I don't know the trigger for it. 

Edit - also, you should be able to find enough in the main game to open the chalice dungeon in the first place.  




 Really?  Fuckin aye!  I've been wanting to play that game so I am super happy to hear that!  Now I feel like the Bloodborne Player is starting to pull its own weight a bit more, and maybe I can stop calling it that :)


Edit:  But when will they make a new GoW game?  




 If you have the disposable income, sure it's worth it, but if not, I'd say don't do it if it's gonna stress your wallet.  There is The Last of Us remastered for PS4, which is definitely worth checking out and a great story of a game, but so far there are no other solid exclusives, or at least, games you can't play on other systems, and most games play better on PC anyhow.  Before BB, my PS4 was basically like a fancy paper-weight.  Maybe some more exclusives will come out (and next gen god of war plz?!) to make me think more highly of PS4 :D 




 In the pre-set dungeons?  No, there are no blood rocks in those, all the way down to the final boss :/ 




 Lots of people have already completed Level 4 Beastbro runs (onebro equivelant in this game:  lowest level you can be with no leveling, though any base starter class qualifies so long as you don't level for the most part).  


I'm working on one right now, and I'm just coming up on Shadows of Yharnam after clearing Cainhurst, and I can tell you that at 10 vitality for waste of skin starter class, most enemies and bosses kill you in one shot anyhow, so I don't see a vitality of 7 being all too different  :D 




 People need to shut the fuck up and mind their own business.  It's become way too common for people to interfere and be nosy with how other parents choose to raise their children.  There are far too many incidences of people misjudging a situation (which they have no business in, in the first place), say, seeing a kid being left in a car (on a perfectly cool day) for a minute, and calling the cops on the parent, even though the parent was just running in and out of the store for a quick minute.  Or god-forbid, you see a child playing outside, and someone calls the cops just because a parent isn't hovering over them.


The point is, all you pushy, needy, helicopter parents out there need to stop turning your children into pussies.  You're fucking ruining your kids.


 




 Statistics show that most children who are abducted are kidnapped by relatives and friends of the famly.  I'm more wary of the strangers I know than the strangers I don't knot.  Stranger-danger was bull-shit hype.  Of course, shit happens, but such is life. 




 Stranger danger is bull-shit anyhow.  The majority of children are abducted by family and friends of the children.  Don't worry so much about the strangers you don't know, worry more about the ones you do know.  Of course shit happens, but that's life, and more power to the parents, but I totally get the concerns.  Alls it takes is one nosy-ass shit-head who can't mind their own business, and bam, you have family services or cops called when your children are perfectly fine.


Fuck this generation of pushy, needy, over-emotional helicopter parents.  They're only serving to weaken the species, turn little boys into little girls, turn all children into total sissies, and hindering the future of the current generations and our country. 




 Clawmark.  I often use the +30% and +20% ones.  Nothing like killing Gherman on NG+ in 4 visceral attacks.  That, and the +15 and +20% stamina ones.  For the oath runes, imo, the hunter's oath rune is the only one that doesn't suck balls.  I'm totally bummed Eileen got killed by Henryk on my level 4 beastbro run, so now I'm gonna be stuck using the shitty executioner rune :/ 




 I agree.  I feel like Micolash was a wonky version of this.  It was so... anti-climactic. 




 Dude - you saying you don't like the Bag-Lady-Cultist look?  I rocked it for awhile until I put together Bone Ash and Crowfeather sets for a reaper vibe.  Though my level 4Bro is Lemmy fucking Kilmister, so he doesn't even need fashion to be awesome. 




 It's definitely not insight.  My level 4 Beastbro had over 10 insight before killing BSB, and they definitely don't spawn until after you kill the BSB. 




 I'm pretty sure you have to find her first before you kill Father G, as later, part of her dialogue is, "So you killed father G huh?" 




 So no one is sure if we are limited to one blood rock ever for each dungeon type?  Ie., I alrready collected 3 blood rocks from each of the loran, Isz, and Pthumerian dungeons.  Does that mean I will never find a blood rock in one of those types again, even if I use different glyphs?  (The three I found were using other people's glyphs, I have yet to explore the ones I originally created myself). 




 Yes, you can get blood rocks from the lowest depths chalice dungeons.  So far I have looted an additional three blood rocks from the lowest root loran, pthumeryn (sp), and isz chalice dungeon glyphs (two from the reddit spreadsheet, and one from fextralife), though I don't know if these are limited, ie., I don't know if you are limited to one bloodrock ever per chalice root type just like you are limited to one blood rock per play through for the main game, or if you can keep running different variations of a root chalice to farm blood rocks.  Can anyone confirm?  Thanks. 




 The level design in both games was awesome, and in bloodborne, the awesome design definitely hid how straight-forward and linear the game really is, though once you learn the maps in either DaS or BB, areas that once seemed sprawling and large really aren't sprawling or large at all.  Even if you have a few wider areas, most places are enclosed between walls and pits or fairly straight-forward paths.


That being said, I thought the variations within BB were pretty great, from gothic cities to the woods, to the nightmares, to the dungeons and so forth, but I'd rather them keep it focused, rather than trying to cram in a volcano world or any other number of cool environments that might not have fit, though hey probably could have implemented a marsh for sure, and maybe a snowy area (more so than the outside of Cainhurst castle which is very small).  Still, I'd rather see it focused like bloodborne, rather than overly ambitious and thus lacking in feeling and atmosphere.  Even then, Dark Souls design suffered a bit past Anor Londo due to time constraints, and DaS2 was definitely stitched and connected together the poorest out of all the games, though the areas (often small) were still fun to explore the first time around.  



The problem is imo, Dark Souls is just one hell of a game to live up to, and it was so new and fresh and unseen in the gaming world (not including DeS here), whereas BB in all its different glory, is still sort of more of the same.  I bet if BB had been released first, and DaS came years later, we would be saying BB was better, because it made such a large impression on us, and you just can't beat nostalgia and that virgin feeling for games like this. 




 I think the statues are statues in yharnam, as they have base stands, and are very repetitive and numerous, and they are also larger than hunan size. The statues in yahr'gul do indeed look like people who were turned to stone just like pompei as they were fleeig for their lives, and this all happened when the nightmare ritual was completed after Rom's death (there are many indicators and notes in game hinting that rom is blocking communication with the great ones, ie, the lake is mud, the byrgenwyrth spider keeps the master (great ones) from us (the cultists), the spider is hiding the rituals)  nd even his name vacuous somehow indicates he is absorbing/blocking the red moon and the rituals)The rest of the people in yahr'gul look like they were fused together into massive lumps of human-flehipedes. It sort of reminds me of the way philosopher stones were created in the series fullmetal alchemist - you had to sacrifice a lot of people for that shit, and it is possible it was the same in yahr'gul.  




 I would ignore them, as the depth 3 ones are lacking in challenges and rewards IMO. By the time I completed the standard dungeon progression, I had more than enough materials to make 3-4 depth 5 glyph dungeons, and plenty of insight to buy more materials, and I quickly obtained 3 blood rocks in one day as well as the top tier of all my favorite runes. 


Edit; as for the challenge, there's nothing like fightin a cannon armed undead giant as a regular enemy that is surrounded by dogs while a bell lady sends endless waves of red asshole spiders at you :D 




 I'm just glad iframes are no longer tied to stats :D


That being said, the worst thing to me about dodging while locked on isn't the movement, but some of the terrible camera angles, especially for large enemies. Staying locked on can be super handy, especially to take advantage of openings and to put yourself in favorable positions, but I've died more to the camera angles than the actual bosses themselves :/ 




 Thanks for the ideas and tips. Going to cainhurst ASAP is a great idea. Sad to hear viscrals are out the window, but I've still been using parry for the free attack window and to ease the pressure off, but the difficulty has definitely has ramped up after Amelia. I don't think I have the patience for this shit tonight (I just died 5 times in a row in the same spot, mostly in one hits from the big axe guys). I think I'll play my main and go spill some blood in the chalice dungeons to unwind -_- 




 Did you get the bloodrock to +10 your weapon?  There is one in the main game in each playthrough.  I missed it on my first no help/spoiler/solo/blind run through, and NG+ was a bit harsh at first, and having a +9 weapon for most of it definitely sucked :D 




 My pro-tip - dodge/roll/strafe to any bosses right side, just get the timing right for their attacks, and never get greedy, and you can pretty much kill every boss in this game that way (aside the ones you should shoot to parry)...especially this asshole.  He once gave me a lot of problems and had me against a wall for a minute, but now he is trivial and I have farmed him several times, including his funky ass...sick version.  (Same method for Parl/Loran Darkbeast by the way) 




 Eh, even then, not all 5's and 6s and 10-20s are created equal.  I forget the exact way they said it was calculated...but yeah, gems in this game are kind of obnoxious :/ 




 Dude.  I've gotten a bunch of rocks from various dungeons, but I have never seen a chunk to date, and that's with running all the lowest depth dungeons and root dungeons  




 Dude.  You say that now, but when you see the new saw cleaver soaps.... 




 No parries?!  Why would you do that to yourself?! 




 Dude.  Don't get me started.  Sinh's stupid fucking 20 mile-span wonky ass hit box that one-shots you while being a mile above your head is total bull-shit   




 Did you use +flat damage gems on your weapons like raw enchants from previous titles?  Or did you use +%physical damage?  Did you experiment?  If so, which gems come out to be more total damage towards end game for Bloodbros?  Also, what were some of the most useful rune setups you found?  I have a few in mind, but I'll have to see how they play out.  Also, how dare you speak unfavorably about the Great Axe of Cheese!  It served you well!  It loves you!  It wants to make mutant alien babies with you! 




 But I thought you can't use the burial blade cuz of stat deficiencies?



Also, I have a few questions for you if ya don't mind.  It is a post of mine yet to be published that I copied/pastrad in draft form that I plan on putting up soon, once reddit stops giving me it's bullshit "you can't do that message:"



So, I just killed Vicar last night (Reindeer dog bitch ruined my no-death kill streak, then Hynrick proceeded to kill Eileen, and then me repeatedly), so I'm not too far into the game, but I was curious for the OneBros who are further in the game or who have beaten it, what has been your best option to pump up your damage, especially for visceral attacks?  For example, Even with a +3 or 4 hunter's axe with the only gems I have at around +2 or 3% physical attack, my viscerals on Heynryk were only doing around 100 damage, and that dude has a few thousand health, so I set that fight aside for later, though I'm pissed I can't get the only Oath rune worth a damn in this run-through, but I digress.



Another question in line with this is - has anyone found a build (combo of runes and gems) to really maximize visceral damage, and make it more worthwhile?  I mean, either way, it is a valuable move anyhow to buy time and avoid direct combat/damage, but I'm wondering what the end game numbers can look.



That being said, anyway, how does the damage look later on in the game with more options?  Ie, the +flat damage blood gems are pointless on say, my main high level toon with pumped STR/SKL, but for those who have come across the +flat damage gems on their onebros, do they wind up being the equivelant of Raw type enchants for your higher level weapons, and thus are better for OneBros?  I mean, I don't have any yet to calculate it myself (and no clawmark runes to pump damage either), but does anyone have the stats or info on how a +9 or +10 weapon on a OneBro looks damage-wise, specifically whether or not +% runes or +flat damage runes wind up being better?  Thanks in advance for your input, and any other tips or tricks are welcome as well. 




 Ah, ok, that explains why it seemed so wonky, as i'd double tap share to start recording, and it would seemingly then not record my next actions (ie, killing father G and cleric beast on 4Bro first attempts ) 




 Dude.  BeastBro all the way.  FourBro just doesn't sound right :D 
























 Vicar is a pushover on a level 4 beastbro run, let alone regular character runs.  I think Father G is the only remotely challenging boss out of the first 3 (cleric, father G and Vicar). 




 Ah.  I remember getting there right after I got the cord from Mergo's wet nurse, and before I even had a chance to inspect the item, I went to Gherman and when he said subit, I thought, I didn't come this far for some geriatric mother-fucker to mercy-kill me.  Bam.  On into NG+, and I was sad because I wasn't finished exploring :D 




 Update:  Here is the post I mentioned.  It is based off a lot of solid in-game info, as well as concrete info. from the game guide (that often isn't in the game).  Be warned though:  SPOILERS!


https://www.reddit.com/r/bloodborne/comments/33hj91/yharnam_was_never_the_destination_lore_spoilers/ 




 I'll find the link for you later when I get home. And I said MP because I didn't want to spoil anything for you. What ending did you get? 




 Oooooh. The "up" part was hidden by my phone. That makes more sense, but still, all I can see now is "how to dick your murders." :D 




 Alls I can make out is "how to dick your murders," but something tells me I am reading that wrong :D 




 Yeah. I have yet to see a satisfactory explanation of them, or something beyond a brief mention. The best I heard so far that fit within te known/posited lore, is that they were messengers/servants of the MP. The guy who posted it made enough sense, but at the same time, there might have been discrepancies in what he posted and te time-line of events and characters, as there is clear architecture and statues based off the messengers in the labyrinth, and the chalice dungeons definitely predate the city of Yharnam and the current events.  




 Beast roar can deflect projectiles. Pretty sure nothing else can... 




 I got invaded while I was wielding the BOM, trying em on for size for the previous micolash boss fight, so I tried them out for that duel and I totally got my ass handed to me. Aside not being used to them in general, the range is shit, and their dodge attacks are pretty easy to avoid.  Should have known better since I have yet to die myself to someone using BoM :D 




 I just think 20 vials is too many, for PvE and PvP. The max should be 10 or 12 (aside runes), and they should heal for a bit more. 30 makes te game too easy and encourages sloppy play :/ 




 Yep.  She had quite a few new moves.  Bitch went total ape-shit on me, extending her arms and turning everything black and going clone-slut on me etc. 




 Lots of posts of people confirming that you can, so long as you are in level range as Siam09 mentioned. 




 I think 'true ending' is what the community dubbed it.  The game calls it "childhood ending."  But yeah.  Pretty awesome. 




 I've continued to level my original character up to 200, because he is always swimming in millions of echoes, so I just ran with him to be able to play with all the different items and weapons.  I don't play him that much, because I have more fun with focused builds (that sacrafice one thing for another, instead of total maxed out badass) - and once you learn the game, you can run through it super quick to make more focused, lower level builds for multiplayer.  As a result, I have a level 90 STR, level 90 SKL toon, and a level 90 BT toon, and I plan on rounding it out with an arcane build and a quality build (I enjoy the simplicity and serratedness of the saw weapons) :D


The point is, if you level too high, you are cutting yourself off from the larger meta of more dedicated (for lack of a better word) players. 




 How quickly in game can you turn Ludwig's into an arcane weapon?  Like, what's the earliest arcane gem you can find?  I wanted to make an arcane build, and I heard Ludwig's was one of the best for those.  Also, is Ludwig's better on a quality build?  Thanks. 




 That game is one of the best ever made.  The 'true' ending reminded me of SoC :D 




 Hmmm. At a glance, that seems much quicker. What was that?  10-15 seconds total?  Compared to before, which seemed like 40-45 seconds?  Also. Is that a stock HD?  Or a SSD? 




 Also, what about Laurence?  :D   




 Also, what about the giant "eyes in the sky" in Old Yharnam? 




 Hey Icarus.  Thanks again for your post the other day, and thanks for this write-up as well.  I am pressed for time at the moment, but I have one thing to ask about in the meantime, well, several things but all about the same subject - and that is about the messengers.


I think this is the first post I've seen where someone actually talks more about the messengers, at least, one that fits better with all the other lore that is given or posited.  If they are MP's homeboys, why do we see their likeness in the chalice dungeons?  I mean, it seems the messengers predate MP and Gherman, or was MP always around meddling, and Gherman just came later?  Either way, it is quite murky, but very simply, What does that time-line look like?


Also relevant - I like what you posted about the brain.  I feel like the brain and it's eyeball infection has hardly been touched by the community, especially the people who commonly make lore videos.  That being said, what is your opinion on the brain and it's seemingly spreading corruption?  Who are those iron golems, and why are they seemingly tasked with killing off the baby eyeball brains?  At first glance, I though they were spider eggs, as there were giant spiders nearby, and they looked like milky white egg sacks, but then later you see the brain, and the eyeballs growing on everything, and this leaves me to think that these are baby wintern lanterns/brain trusts that are spreading and growing, but why are the golems killing them?  If the brain was created as a form for the great one to inhabit, or whatever else it could be, why are they killing the babies?  Simply trying to control an experiment that got out of hand?  Because it seems like those eyeballs grow into the brain trusts.  And as for the brain trusts, why is their brain matter made out of messengers?  I don't have the time to re-read this and try to figure out where this stands in your facts/speculation write-up, but how do the messengers fit in with the idea that they are MP's servants/messengers, yet they also make up those brains, including the mother brain?  I suppose they could have been kidnapped by Mensis school and used in the experiments/conjuring then?  Would love to hear your thoughts.  Thanks. 




 Uuuh, what? 




 Right, but from what I've read on here, the vial and consumable system (namely bullets) makes it hard for new players, and it winds up as double frustration for them, because they need to farm vials period, but they aren't that good at the game, so they then use as many as they farm or just die more.  Same thing with insight.  They run out of insight, often on failed summons, and they don't know how to get more, or can't find more.  Etc.  For veteran FROM fans, I think this game was pretty easy to catch the hang of, but for new players, not so much.  Either way though, it all funnels you towards the direction of 'git guud skrub,' but I totally see how it could turn some people off, but my point remains.  10 vials (with the same runes to increase the numbers, I mean, who the fuck needs 24 or 25 vials?) would mean you don't have 20 vials to burn through each time, and thus would hopefully learn to play more carefully and be more cautious.  I think it would be the best balance between the two, and also, make PvP and PvE in general just more exciting and dangerous :D 




 Uhhhh, still nope.  I don't see where Brain Trust comes from :D  I don't think I'm being too dense... 




 I think Blood vials should be limited to 10 or 12 tops, but they should heal for a larger percentage of health.  I feel like once you get the hang of this game, even in chalice 5s and NG++++ and especially for PvP, 20 is just way too many vials, and if anything, I tend to fight and play better the less crutches or healing items I have to lean on.  I feel like having so many just encourages sloppy play, and makes the game too forgiving. 




 Winter lanterns?  I know that comes from the guide, but that just flat out sounds like a print error, typo, or really bad translation...


Also. Where did the name "brain trust" come from in the first place?  :D


Edit:  But yes. Fuck those things.  




 Yeah. Hopefully the patch helps, drastically. Otherwise I do worry about the longevity of this game.its hard for me to understand how FROM really fucked up multiplayer so bad, and the loading screens shouldn't just be brushed aside either. Those are some critical errors for them, and I feel like they should have known better or done better. 


 And I know dark souls 2 was far from perfect, but it was still the best game of 2014, and I'm pretty sure all of us FROM fans had a lot of fun with it and played it more than anything else, which is kind of funny considering how much everyone bitches about it. The point is, B-Team still gets a cookie :) 




 I think that is just the example that some bosses show up as regular enemies sometimes, like undead giants and what not.  




 The thing being the MP's dream is a theory, but yes, we do know Ebrietas is a great one, and we do know the other great ones have form - that I am not denying, but it is important to note where these forms exist, as this game pays great attention to details in where and when characters exist.  Ebrietas is the only one that exists in form in the waking/physical world.  The other great ones have form too, but they exist in their respective realities/dreams/realms (Amygdala in Nightmare frontier, the brain and mhergo in nightmare of mensis, etc).  The implied message about the great ones is that they transcended the limitations of their physical bodies (through force of will, like the hunters learned to dodo), and they can clearly alter and affect reality, and that is the sort of power and knowledge that the characters and institutions in this game have been chasing.  




 I didn't say it was better, and you might be right about that, but there are still some holes to be poked:  the lagstabs and phantom bull-shit has always been a problem with FROM's servers or whatever gerbil-wheel set-up they have going on.


And at least they added the agape ring at pretty much direct requests from players to offset SM in DaS2.  That being said, DaS2 was far less laggy for me than DaS.  DaS had terrible PvP lag for me and imo, and it killed a lot of the fun.  DaS2 was much smoother, and other than hackers, in a zillion games of PvE and PvP, I never had people warping all over the place. 




 Sure. I always enjoy the lore discussions, whether it's someone teahimg me something, or poking holes in someone else's theories. And I always love that the different interpretations only bring up more and more questions :D 




 In general, it's to keep you at a certain level to be able to easily interact with the majority of the community. Most people seem to be stickin between levels 75-120 for both PvE and PvP. It also forced you to actually has to pick and choose your item/magic/weapon usage to make for unique characters and fights. If everyone had 50 in every stat, it would make the game a bit droll as you would be over leveled and over powered, whereas with a level cap, you actually have to make some sacrifices for your build to specialize in certain areas.  




 Ah. Ok. All square here.  




 Fair point :) 




 Yeah. The impressions from the game were that all the great ones weren't necessary one happy pantheon of gods, but that they all had their individual motives an desires, and not all of them were created equal. Thanks for the info. Look forward to hearing what else you might be able to add to it.  




 Dude... the decent damage, the awesome move-set.  The staggers, the range, the sweeps, the knock downs, the long-range R2 followed by a quick R1.... and I just can't put that thing down!  I swear - I tried the rest, but the damage and range of the hammer sucked, and it was way too slow.  Same with the wheel.  Why can't their be any other STR weapon equivelants?!

FOR THE RECORD:  Most of the 2hand damage, and even like, half the 1h damage, comes from blunt damage, not physical.  Check out the post from Icarus with the pictures from the official guide. 




 But if it were to wind up remotely similar, then NO please :D 




 Woohooo!  I see my judas priest reccomendation in there :)

Sad Wings of Destiny was fuckin awesome! 




 Haha. YUP.  Moar coffee and vapes please! 




 Awww, I know the doll says, "I hope you find your worth in the waking world," implying Yharnam and all that, but she is dumb and naive.  I was really hoping Yharnam was a dream of the great ones, and in a sense, we were trying to wake up the great ones, as the world was them retaining their consciousness throuhg force of will, just like Mensis Nightmare and Micolash, Gherman and the hunter's dream, etc.  Their physical bodies are dead and/or gone, but they are still alive on a different plane of existence.  Ok.  This makes it a little less interesting :/ 




 Umm, no, we don't need an alternative to the OP ridiculous bug of the rifle spear (great weapon, the bug aside).  I don't think the Reiter's bullets not scaling with arcane is a mistake.  I think the Rifle Spear's ridiculous damage is a mistake/bug. 




 Actually, I think the doll is just a construct, but due to her coy and aloof nature, she comes off as aloof, almost as if she knows more than she lets on, but in reality she really is quite simple and naive...  fun speculation though :D


Edit:  based on what others with the guide say that the guide says, aside the doll's obvious nature (as she even says she was created by humans, and seemingly is quite simple) 




 Wow.  Crzy to see that my high % +physical gems are nearly useless, or rather, only effective seemingly less than half the time in the axe...  Ok, I'm definately going to have to buy this book! 




 Yeah, it was pretty disturbing when you find mild-mannered Alfred post ape-shit status, covered in gore, and so entrenched in his violence, that he hardly even recognizes or cares to see you, the player character :D 




 I'm fan enough, and I enjoy all things Bloodborne, so I likely will.  Apparently it is hard copy on Amazon for 25 bucks or so?  That sounds like one hell of a deal! 




 Bingo.  He is hiding the rituals from sight, or from being completed.  In turn, Rom is also keeping the cultists/servants from their master (the great one(s) ).  It even says "ritual seal" broken when you kill Rom, which fulfills the note you first see in Yahr Guhl (sp) of "madmen work in madness to bring about more madness rituals," or whatever. 




 Ah ok, so it isn't that he wants the ritual to be completed (via breaking the seal by killing Rom), he wants you to stop the WHOLE ordeal, not just the small portion that Rom is scrambling or blocking?


Edit:  Speaking of which - is there any more info on Rom?  How he got there, or who or what he is?    Or how he became to be the seal that blocks the cultist's rituals?  I firmly believe (ed) that he is not human and never was.


 




 But they're so cute! 




 So, is this from the Bloodborne Collector's Edition Strategy Guide by Future Press?  Thanks. 




 Hmmm, this sort of hints at my thoughts that the brain was indeed a great one (as descibed in game), but he was more or less thought into being somewhere between the other great ones wills, Micolash, the Mensis School, and the age old adage of wanting to "grow eyes on the mind." 




 Dude.  I thoroughly enjoyed your post, but how does anyone play Destiny for more than two or three hours tops?  I mean, I get it, the compulsion to play grindy games often lasts longer than the fun, but the decent graphics and run-of-the-mill yet tight shooter mechanics weren't even remotely redeeming of the fact that it was completely unimaginative, generic, had no intrigueing characters or plot points, the voice acting was terrible, it had mediocre gameplay, and by mission 2 or 3, they were already recycling the same maps...


Ahem.  Sorry, I just really hate that game and how shitty it was, and how everyone rushed out to buy such a polished hype-turd.  And to this  day, I'm still baffled that anyone can stomach it :D 




 Punished for failing to learn?  But that is how life is, and how it should be, and it is a shame there are so many stupid people out there not being punished as much as they probably deserve.  But it is such a great parallel to existense itself - art imitating life really :D 




 I use the opposite strategy to avoid her, be it in NG+++, or chalice dungeons.  If I lock on her, I can't see when to start running to avoid the one-shot lasers, as trying to roll or dodge stops me for a split second, and I get zapped.  I know they make noises, but I'm usually too stressed to  figure that out in those moments.  I've subsequently locked her down to where I can kill her in one attempt every time, even on new characters, but man oh man, trying not to die in that last phase the first time fighting her was brutal  




 Yes.  There are a lot of gaps to fill, but so far, it would seem that we don't even know what the real world is anymore.  The only way to wake up the moon presence is by our will becoming powerful enough that we can retain consciousness upon death (the way gherman, micolash, and the other great ones do, even after permanent death of the body), and the only way we can do this is by killing Gherman himself, and this only results in slavery to the MP because we do not have the insight to know that the MP is is there orchestrating this blood-orgy and fucking with us.  After having the necessary insight through the umbilical cords themselves (seemingly the blue-print of evolution and the 'how to' of becoming a great one') we begin to see through the dreams, and then we finally arise to front and center stage of the brutal shit-show of the MP's nightmare realm, and we get the MP's attention.  The MP still wants to make us a thrall to his will and his dream, but we say, *"not today bitch, we know better,"* and when we finally kill it, we become the new Chief Asshole and somehow usher humanity forward into a new age of it's Baby Squid-Monster Overlord...
 




 It still wound up making quicker and easier multiplayer connections, be it for PvE or PvP :/ 




 Gotcha.  Thanks.  Did some more reading up on the original post and the updates and comments and I see what they mean.  Hopefully these odds and ends get fixed sooner rather than later. 




 Gotcha.  I remember seeing the original post a few days ago.  Just read up on the updates and the comments, and I see what you guys mean now.  Thanks Atrophy and Vividos. 




 Dude.  I loved the rifle spear in PvE (talking regular use, not arcane exploit), even though the damage was relatively weak for the first half of the game.  The weapon is fun, and it comes with a lot of reach and versatility.  The build I was using it on was switched to BT (I was just using the rifle-spear cuz I hated the cane), and I was hoping to make a dedicated PvE/PvP rifle spear build just because it was one of the most fun weapons I've played with, but I suppose I'd rather wait till this arcane rifle spear stuff blows over as well :/ 




 I don't believe MP and Oedeon are one in the same myself, but see my above post, as we technically don't see the MP in the "physical world" either (if one even exists in game).  We only encounter the MP in Gherman's dream, and I believe the rest of the game is the MP's dream, hence we are trying to transcend it by waking it up, and refusing to become its thrall. 




 Not that the MP is clearly defined, but Odeon is more clearly defined, as he is described as the formless Great One who exists only in thoughts or words or whatever, which is where the Caryll runes come from.  The MP clearly has a physical form, though we only see it in Gherman's dream, which might mean it has no physical form either, as it supports the idea that the Great One's ascencion is them leaving there physical bodies behind, which is supported by the fact that Ebrietas, the great one that was explicitly described as "being left behind" and "abandoned," is the only one we see in the waking or physical world, which might be a great one's dream in the first place, because the whole game is a series of character's wills forcing them to retain their consciousness, ie., Gherman's Dream, Micolash's dreams (whose dead body we actually see after The One Reborn) and so forth, and it seems our character's true mission is to wake the great ones from their dreams, so we can transcend it.  I believe the waking world (as the Doll implies) is the MP's (a great one's) dream, and I do not believe him and Oedeon are one in the same.  Oedeon is just one of the former great ones that has ascended and left the physical realms behind, and has never been seen in a dream, be it his or someone else's. 




 How do we know that you're not supposed to be able to?  Does arcane not apply to the reittersplash then?  And accidentally apply to the rifle spear?  Thanks. 




 Dude.  I missed the charred set on my first toon my first time around, But I absolutely fucking love the full charred armor set with the top hat!   




 Well, it partially summons her, as in, it shoots out her tentacles.  Other in-game item descriptions relating to the choir tell us Ebrietas was a great one that was left behind.  It seems they use strong language either way in saying "abandoned" and "left behind."  Maybe she wasn't strong enough to transcend her physical body like the other great ones seemingly did? 




 Oedeon:  *"Should we bring Ebrietas with us when we leave?"*


Moon Presence:  *"Shhhhhh!  No dude!  She stands like, right in your face when she speaks to you.  Seriously, doesn't she have any concept of personal space?  Let's just leave her behind."* 




 Item descriptions say she is a great one, and that she "was left behind."  My guess based off lore is that the great ones were able to transcend their physical bodies (in the same way in-game items tell us hunters can retain their consciousness through sheer force of will, ie., like gherman and his dream, or dead micolash and him as host of the nightmare).  The schools and church and players in game are trying to transcend the physical world it seems, transcend the realites in front of them, and it seems the hunter exists in gherman's dream, and he is trying to wake the current great one (the moon prescence) up from its dream... but it all only brings up more questions. 




 But between the choir garb and other in-game item descriptions, the game flat out tells us that Ebrietas is indeed a Great One, and that she was left behind, left-behind being the real question as to what it means.  Did the other ones ascend?  They seem to not exist in the physical realm, and only exist in mind and dreams and other realms of existence.  Why was Ebrietas left behind?  Etc? 




 How is it that it winds up so kerplow-powerful?  The flat arcane damage gets applied to each pellet and is thus more powered than a % gem could make it?  I loved playing with the rifle spear (regular gem slots, didn't know how OP it could be) in the PvE game on my skill build (since I hated the cane) until I went for Evylyn/Chikage.  I wanted to make a build around the weapon because it was so much fun, though the damage was a bit lacking - but I don't want to make a build around this since it will likely be patched out..  




 Is it really a glitch though?  I just thought it was OP mechanics the way the arcane rifle spear turns out? 




 Welcome to Camera Souls, where the hardest enemy you will ever fight is ultimately, THE CAMERA!


YOU DIED! 




 The brain is a great one that was found/created in the nightmare (see the description of living string item). The first eyeball growths you see are dead and covered in a milky white film, hence I said I and others mistook them for spider eggs, especially with the appendages that look like they are coming out of eggs. Later, in the area of mother brain, you can clearly see they are eyeballs growing on everything, which is seemingly what happens if it is left unchecked. The question is, what are they, why are they growing, and who are the little iron golems and why are they seemingly trying to poke out all the eyeballs? 




 Mother Brain and her scourge of eyeballs that are over-running the Nightmare of Mensis.  The first time through that area, we see those pale, milky white sacks covering various parts of the level and the mansion where Micolash resides.  At a glance, I thought they were spider eggs, after all, there seem to be legs growing out of many of them, and there is a giant spider and her spiderlings nearby.  It all seemed simple enough.  From there, you observe the little iron golem men in the mansion strolling around, as if they are tasked to destroy these eggs, since the eggs have arrows/spikes jabbed through them.  It isn't until you find the hidden area with Mother Brain that you see that they aren't innocuous little sacks of spider eggs, but actual eyeballs, as if the brain is replicating, or spreading some sort of disease or curse or who knows what.  Those are the obvious ideas behind it (the mother brain spreading her rottenness), but I was curious what other people's ideas and opinions and speculations were about this area and how it relates to Mother Brain, the iron golems, and the spreading eyeball scourge.  It's almost like the opposite of much of the rest of the game, where the characters and enemies willingly blindfold or blind themselves to keep from seeing what is before them.  I look forward to your replies.  Thanks. 




 They don't scale.  Sure, the first crows you meet in game don't have as many HP as the same crow enemies later on in the game, but they are just adjusted to general game progression.  They don't slide along with your direct leveling/gameplay. 




 Dude.  Charred Hunter's set is pimp!  So much Heavy-Metal-Dracula-Bad-Ass hunter goodness.  Looks great with the Top Hat, and so many other things! 




 Great One***, not Old One  :D
 




 You are new to the Souls games huh?  Yes.  You are doing exactly what you need to be doing, and you are exactly where you need to be.  Do not look up spoilers or info or help.  Slug it out and play blind through one of video gaming's most unique experiences :D 




 For pretty much the entire game, including the weak ass final (or near final) boss :D 




 I think this game was the easiest, because a lot of us players knew what to look for and expect from a FROM game.  Once upon a time, stumbling upon a black knight as a newb in Dark Souls got you wreckt, but now you can go fight it no problem, or even beat the game as a onebro.  Remember, this game and its mechanics and brutality are new to a lot of people.  Sure, even for longer term Souls players it takes some time to learn the new combat system, but once you get that down, it is essentially more of the same.  Try to imagine playing DeS or DaS or BB for the first time, or as your first FROM game.  That being said, I agree.  The Chikage hunter in the Grand Cathedral is harder than pretty much all the bosses in the game. 




 That was all speculation and hype. 




 I think they should have just kept the tried and true summoning sign method, and to keep with the theme, instead of little runic signs via soapstones, it could have just been your messengers sitting there, rining the bells for you. 




 Traded in DaS1 and 2?  I get it, the games aren't for everyone.  Go play CoD  :P 




 TIL That everyone hates the books they were forced to read in high school.  That, and a lot of people don't understand literature, or its significance in history...  Not everyone is meant to or likes to read.  Go back to watching TV.   There are a lot of ignorant people here.  BRING ON THE DOWN VOTES! :D 




 A lot of people had mentioned it and continue to mention it, but it was far more original and it pushed the bar for its time, though other authors who remain unpopular or unheard of had done it better decades before Salinger, so yeah, fuck that book, but hey, it set the bar for generations of self-absorbed navel-gazers to come! 




 But it set the bar for generations of self-absorbed navel-gazers to follow!  It's like, the thing to do! 




 Longer reply:  I didn't mean to dismiss micolash'd blatherings, since as you said, insight is madness in this game, but another key thing he says is "the lake is mud," or something like that, implying how Rom hides or hinders the rituals the church is trying to work, hence he has the title vacuous. It answers the question of why Wilhem hid him  - Rom is there to be a scrambler to the church. Something about him/her/it hides/hinders the church's workings. The church knows Wilhem is at odds with them, and they sent a hunter in choir garb to keep watch on him - hunter who even uses the auger of Ebriatis, the great one that was left behind, the great one the church found, and the only great one that actually exists in the physical (or dreaming or waking?) world. 


Also. Every other human in bloodborne gets a lot of screen time, dialogue, or descriptions in the game via items or notes, yet there is none at all tht mention rom except those that reference te bergynwyrth spider. I don't believe this is incidental, accidental, or intentional. There is no mention of Rom the human, because he never was human.  The implication is that rom is somehow kin (yes, great one blood is an item in game, and we get none from rom), and an interpretation of what Micolash says is akin to Jenny in forest gump, when she says, "dear god, make me as a bird so I can fly far away."  She doesn't actually expect to be turned into a bird, or that birds were other entries that were just one day slapped with the gift of wings. She just wants their ability. There is no concrete evidence in what Micolash says to make it truly lean one way or the other, but based on all the evidence in game, and the fact that Rom the human is never mentioned, I happen to believe Micolash just meant what he said about rom as, "I want what he has."  Nothing more, nothing less. 


And still, this only brings up more questions of "who, what, when and why?"  Your thoughts?   :) 




 Quick reply: I thought the same thing, until I found "great one blood" in a chalice dungeon, and thought, 'holy shit. That's a big difference'. Worth noting, great one blood (at least in coldblood form) is not pale. 


Will read and write more later.  




 And this hiding keeps it from coming to fruition by blocking people's perceptions?  Hence the title vacuous? 




 Dude. I hated the blunderbuss too. It seemed do much more clunky and harder to use than pistols :/ 




 I thought vacuous was somehow relate to how Rom is sort of like a signal scrambler, somehow keeping the cultist's rituals from working. He ce, once you kill him, the ritual in the unseen village is completed successfully, everyone is killed and the one reborn is...reborn. This is supported by the notes, "the spider keeps all manner if rituals from us."  As well as, "The Byrgynwyrth spider keeps our master from us."  The spider is rom, and the master is the one reborn or the kin or the great ones themselves or whatever, not Wilhem as a lot of people presume. This could furthermore support the Wilhem being at direct odds with te churh, hence e summoned Rom, though a lot of the details are still missing. 


Worth noting, a lot of people think Rom was a person turned into a weird creature, but there is nothing in game at all to support this. I think Rom is kin, he ce we get kin blood and not great one blood from him. People like to reference micolash'd dialogue, but that is the ranting of a madman, and saying "give us eyes as you have Rom," doesn't mean Rom was born as a human and later gifted with eyes. It can just as well mean he was simply born/created that way, and Micolash says "give us eyes like rom" just like a child might say "I want wings like the birds so I can fly"


There's another idea I have that I have yet to see be discussed - and that is the brain that is covered in eyes, which in game it is directly called a great one, and the point is, with all the lines between humanity and our base nature and dreams and reality being blurred, was the brain found?  Or was it forged through the yearnings and experiments of mensis and wilhem's sayings "line our brains with eyes."  Very simply, was the brain basically "thought" into existence through the nightmare, the great ones, and the wills of those working on te crazy experiments? 




 Not all the chalice merchants are. I remember one or some of the others in a dead end room that was an offshoot of one of the paths.  




 Right. And it took me awhile to figure those tougher enemies out. I honestly think FROM put them there to crush the player and their spirit, because new players just cant or wont stan a chance asindt them, andeven with good equipment those enemies can own you if you underestimate them, but I think they are there so that when you come back to kill them, you can really see how much better you have become as a player :D 




 I got ya though.  Like Hellkite drake?  Or black Knights?  I mean, even then, Hellkite drake was definitely not meant to be killed right away, and Onebro stuff is when you have already become pro enough at the game and you need a challenge, but you're absolutely right.  There are no real "HOLY SHIT" moments of, *'that guy fucking stomped me, and I would have never in a million years beat him my first go or anywhere near it.'*  


But, aren't you looking at this from the perspective of a vetted FROM fan?  What about the people new to the series who took days or weeks to kill the first two bosses?  I bet those executioner's were about as hard as black knights were back in the day, wouldn't you think?


I mean, we've also come to expect this from them, so I think the player base has just gotten better at playing FROM's games as well, and they know what to expect, and it is hard to recapture those previous moments of "holy jebus who was that that just stomped me!?" 




 You know, big poisonous blood monsters that make you sick? 




 Judas Priest - The Ripper 




 Pendant in its usefulness, but I think iris there to cement the lore. The whole the great ones and hunters and etc can retain their consciousness trough force of will, even if there bodies are dead.  




 You know that's not the Blood Letting Beast that everyone complains about as hard, right?  :P 




 What a bunch of assholes.  Tell them to go play CoD if they are going to complain about what has been an excellent staple since the beginning of FROM's game design.  It adds a nice touch of needed variety and excitement and exploration.  I'd love to see more Sen's fortresses and Cainhurst's and traps and AIDS monsters! 




 Yeah.  The worst part of Cainhurst is how short it is, though the excellent level design in general of BB really hides how short and linear the game actually is :/ 




 What was your poison resist at?  My level 4 bro couldn't do the last phase of that fight without getting herpes, cuz that fucker just looks at me and BAM, I get bloodbeast AIDS and my HP starts dropping like dead hookers in my basement, and I gotta use an antidote cuz that shit is super powerful.  Even with chucking molotovs and blood lure potions, that fucker still moves to fast and is on me giving me the beast herp before I can even tap the dodge button. 




 "Oh look (Gherman), you found yourself a (another) hunter."


"May you find your worth in the waking (dreaming) world." 




 Haha.  At first I thought, "Look, those crows think they are dogs!" and later I was all like, "Holy shit, those dogs fucked those crows!"


That, and I thought it was some sort of bad Japanese to English transition, like, somehow, Miyazaki thought crows barked in English speaking countries :D 




 Why would anyone use a cannon for PvE?  I mean, other guns and weapons are far more versatile and useful, and they don't take such a large stat investment and use half of a precious resource in one shot :D


My only suggestion is using pistol for parry and visceral ing him to death. You just need the patience and the practice. I haven't gotten to him yet on my level 4 beast bro, but the plan is to parry+charge or strong attack, since level 4 viscerals don't do shit for damage.  




 Lots of lower tier rune, 2 blood stone chunks, and a lot of other bloodstone upgrades.  Coming here ASAP was indispensable for my level 4 beastbro  :D 




 For low stat characters?  Yes, for sure.  Beastbro uses an axe though, because I hate the cane, and the axe is badass and has an indispensalbe moveset and good crowd control.  I just use the % ones for now, because I have never really seen a worthwhile flat damage gem outside of a chalice dungeon IIRC  :D 




 I've gotten quite a few at random off rats, but why do you need to farm for them?  In following standard dungeon progression, and thoroughly exploring those and the later root chalices you create for loot, you should have more than enough crafting materials to make a few top tier dungeons at any given time. 




 You can run in tighter circles though and make it proc quicker, so yes, it is faster to a point.  Or you can walk around the table and have it proc once on each side, or run it in a tight circle and get it to proc quicker. 




 My guess is they are as close as it gets to "raw" upgrades in previous souls games, whereas, a nice flat damage bonus to a weapon would be worth more to a low stat character than a +%scaling weapon.

For example, my Level 4 beastbro would probably get more out of a gem with a flat 20-40 damage, rather than +15-20%, since his STR and SKL are like, 8 or 9 each, though, I haven't gotten any worthwhile flat damage gems yet in game to compare the differnces, as the really good ones are hard to get.

 Yeah, in general, I've found it to be less reliable for stun-locking enemies, but the 2h/transformed charged attack will send the lesser to regular to large enemies flying everytime, though the diagnal angle can make it a bit less user friendly than say the horizontal spin2win of the hunter's axe. 




 They are too loud and obnocious, just like the crows.  My issue is that I'm pretty sure there is little to no fade in these sound effects, so no matter how close or far I am from the mob, it sounds like they are screaming or barking in my ears at a gajillion decibals  




 Haha.  You've put together 1% of the story so far :D

Keep going.  There is so much more to it! 




 Yep.  That being said, I've had my fair share of, "Fuck those guys and their cheap ass frenzy mechanic!"


I do think frenzy could have been worked in better.  It should either do a large chunk of damage, but less than what it currently does, like 50-60% health tops, or keep it at 70% damage, but not let it kill you, so at most, it would reduce your HP to 1. 




 Wow.  That's crazy-awesome.  Good on your friend.  


Man, I never fight that thing head on simply due to the zero margin of error allowed fight for a cursed dungeon, plus, everytime I've ever tried to engage him close, he often chains his regular attack with a charge or leap at point blank, and dat hitbox gets me everytime from such a close range.   Guess I just need to git guuder.  Also, I don't play my Chikevyln too often, so that option of bone-marrow ashing the last large chunk of his health for safety and ease hasn't been an option :/ 




 Once you create a chalice, can you still join other glyphs even if you take that original chalice down?  I mean, I know you have to create the original chalice type to be able to join a glyph of the same dungeon type, but is that memory inherent in your game/character, or do you have to leave the original chalice up the whole time? 




 I hate them too, but they're not that cheap.  There are lots of tools to deal with them, including ranged weapons, sedatives, frenzy resist armor, and frenzy resist runes.


The brains are a prime example of what the souls games do best:  they put extreme pressure on players, intentionally inducing panic and "what the shit is going on?" confusion mode, which in turn causes players to panic, and thus not play as methodically and carefully as they must in a Souls game.


Like any other enemy or boss, if you approach them methodically and with patience and a level-head, they can be easily taken down, and create that satisfaction that the Souls games are known for. 




 But DaS2 was a B-Team thing, so I think it would be more likely to be seen in BB than DaS2, but still, I wouldn't necessarily count on it or expect it :D 




 Really?  I was never hit by any of his jump attacks ever, just by staying locked onto him, and dodging forward (to where he is diving from), right as he is diving, and thus, he winds up behind you, and you can just turn to face him and click to quick-turn the camera around to attack him again. 




 Comment so I can find this later.  Thanks for the links :D 




 They are awesome weapons. I find Ludwig's to be a bit dull, but the chikage is fun to play with, and to play against.

And Yes, rifle spear is OP, but only cuz it's broke as shit right now, an it's a shame because its such a fun weapon.  




 It's not OP, It's just plain bugged.  Ludwig and Chikage is OP, considering how easy and quick you can build a character to do top-shelf damage with those weapons, even with no depth 5 gem-farming. 




 Because reddit has the dumbest ranking system, and the arbitrary down-voting and upvoting system is totally horse shit, and just like any other form of trolling or bitching on the internet - it is unregulated and unchallenged and it doesn't really mean anything :D 




 Ha ha.  Wot a storee Mahrk! 




 Yeah, Yogg Saron was a long time ago... 




 That's so... gay? 




 Loran Darkbeast is fairly telegraphed and easy to dodge though once you figure it out, though his movesets are a lot more brutal than Paarl, and he can easily one shot you once he is fully charged and doing some of his bad ass moves.  Havne't gotten to Ebrietas on my level 4 beast-bro, as I have been mostly working on my beastbro, but my onebro runs are usually the last thing I do in a SOULS games once I am border-line done with it.  OH HAI COLLETE! 




 Are you gemming the burial blade correctly?  You can get an easy 650-750 AR with the correct gems, which are the +8-9% physical gems with the flat +70ish arcane damage.  The burial blade is bad-ass, it just takes longer to optimize since you have to farm depth 5 chalices, whereas, you can make your +10 chikage or +10 evelyn or +10 ludwig's bad-ass with minimal time and gem-farming investments, which is why it is the easy sort of go-to common-cheese builds :D 




 The burial blade is much harder to optimize than other weapons, as you need to get to lowest level chalice dungeons to obtain the odd gems that are like +9% physical and +70ish flat arcane damage.  Those gems are built for BoM and Burial Blade.  Furthermore, I think the best is the Uncanny Burial Blade, as it has a triangle gem slot so you can add another %physical damage +flat arcane gem, since most of the waning gems are crap for that setup. 




 Yeah, it's super easy to raise super-high with minimal stat and time investments too :/ 




 Yeah.  You have to master the camera adjustment of facing your character opposite direction, and tapping the right stick button to auto-orient your character with direction he is facing.  Next game:  Cameraborne, where the hardest enemy you fight is the camera, and they are all cameras.  Oh god.  I'm having PTSD flashbacks about the centipede demon in DaS.  WHY GWYNN WHY!?!!  YOU'RE TEARING ME APART LISA! 




 oh god, what an abomination! 




 Yeah, the "why" of most FROM games is seldom the point, or all that important.  It is a rash of people and characters dealing with the "what" of it, often futilely until the bitter end.  The point is, life is a bitch, then you die.  It's all so pointless.  Fuck it. 




 Stop spoiling your game play!  You only get one chance at a first time play-through, so drink every last drop of that coagulated menstrual blood and take your punishment! 




 Yep.  I killed him on another toon last night, and took me a few tries to readjust to the whole delayed movements and dodges.  But I totally enjoyed the waltz of it once I got the timing right again :D 




 If you are using BoM, stunlock her into a wall, a pillar, or just stun lock her period, as she will likely wind up pinned up against something in general.  If you have 15 arcane, you can use beast roar to make this fight even more trivial.  R1 spam your BoM until your stamina is gone, immediately use beast roar, then resume spamming, but don't give her a second to even begin attacking, or she might one or two shot you.  And if you can keep her pinned at the part where she imbues her weapon with fire, and don't let her complete the enchantment, she will spend the rest of the light trying to light her sword on fire, like some retarded child trying to light water on fire. 




 And if I open those, then all dungeons are open to me?  Because I thought I would be limited to only exact matches, ie., cursed, fetid loran = only cursed fetid loran 




 So if you make a dungeon with all offerings (ex, Isz root or loran root), then you can join any dungeon with any combination of those offerings?  Thanks. 




 There is no proof from what Micolash says that Rom was once human, and was turned into kin or anything else.  There is no way to prove what he says as literal, as it can just as well be taken in the same manner as someone saying "god gave birds wings so they could fly."  It doesn't mean god reached down and glued wings on ferrets and thus that is where birds came from, as if it was just a gift that was given, it just means, 'as they were made/created/evolved/born."  There is no concrete proof for either case, but I find it odd that every human character in game has a lot of screen time, dialogue, or info via item descriptions, yet there is nothing related to 'Rom the human' anywhere.  I don't think this is an oversight.  I think Rom is what he has always been, and whatever that may be, it never was human. 




 Ok. Cool. I think that will be a good go to spot to get guaranteed radial gems with minimal farming for my burial blade. Thank you.  




 The official guide. There have been a lot of posts listing pictures of the guide. Look up your primary weapons and the damage types and multipliers in those posts.  




 It depends. Flat physical affects all damage types (phys, thrust, blunt) but if you are primarily using blunt or thrust attacks, it might do you well to double check what other gems you can docket in there to maximize what attacks you use the most, especially since different attacks have different modifiers. It also depends if the enemy is open or not.  




 Another note:  40 dex is a shit ton of investment for a weapon that is best and meant to be utilized in 2handed Bloodtinge form - that is what you do your killing with, the R1's are just for transforming there and back to minimize the HP leak.  Chikage is not for a dex build, and you also lose out on Eve's damage with non hard-capped BT.  I would have gone to 20-25 skill max, and instead gone for 15 arcane for the hunter's tools, as beast roar is stupid OP and easy to stunlock people with (as well as your only parry type defense while using 2h stance, which is dangerous with only 26 vit), and maybe pumped vit to at least 30, especially if you are going to be invading people. 




 While fun to play (with and against), I'm sort of sad that the majority of my fights are against BT chikage/eves or Ludwigs :(


Makes me with there were more weapons in this game, or at least, more go to ridiculously powerful weapons, rather,  more viable and competitively powerful weapons, that are as easy to obtain and get the most out of them with minimal time investment and little to no farming.  I'm enjoying my burial blade build right now, but to get to the best gems for it, I have to run to the ends of the chalice dungeons and farm the lowest levels, as there are no +physical % damage +flat arcane anywhere in the main game or basic chalices, whereas you can put a few easy to obtain +18 to +20% gems in the chikage and call it a day 


edit:  specifics 




 I know a lot of people that need to revisit the past and learn how to spell :P 




 Doctor:  "Please point to the chart and tell me exactly how it is that you suck so much." 




 Don't forget the baby great ones or surrogates or whatever they are - all those little slug things that just stare longingly at the celestial garden/alter of despair. 




 Great write up, thank you, but due to the format of one of the first parts, can you please clarify that this info is correct:


*EDIT; If you want guaranteed radials with physical % and arcane add:*

*Glyph: ba362b97*

*Location: Phtumeru Ihyll root.*

*Rites: Cursed, Foetid, Rotten.*

*Unlock lever, and farm the brainsucker mob guarding the treasure chest in the t-room before the first boss. The best it can drop is a rating 17 gem, but its a guaranteed radial...*


That edit was for all the information below, right?  Also, do you know what the first boss of this dungeon is?  Ie., is the boss itself worth farming for gems too?  (I mean, you would have probably mentioned it if it was, but still worth asking)  Thanks.


edit:  grammar/clarity 




 Aside a bloodtinge build, which is this game's ranged build equivelent (which a FROM game should have), guns do little to minimal damage, especially on the later bosses who have a billion HP and can kill you in one or two hits, but I am wasting my breath, as you are either a retarded troll, one ignorant motherfucker, or just plain retarded, period. 




 Mr souls veteran here took 6 tries to kill cleric beast and 4 for papa G?  An easy boss is one you can kill in one or two tries, and you taking that many attempts is pathetic.  I killed cleric beast my first try and it took me two tries to kill Papa G in my very first NG cycle ever.  You sound like a noob, and a lot of your fellow newbs spend hours and days and weeks getting past these areas your having a hard time with. 




 The brain trusts always sing as far as I can tell. And the baby starts crying as soon as you beat rom. That beig said, no one has come up with a decent lore connection of the messengers and who what and why they are, and even more intriguing, no one has yet to adequately explain why Mind of Mensis and the Winterb Lantern's brain matter is made out of dead messengers  




 Dude. Beast roar is awesome. You can counter projectiles and knock lesser foes and bosses and PCs on their asses. I think I'm gonna put 15 arcane in all my builds from here on out. Fuck having 50 vitality :D 




 Parry or beast roar or use longer ranged weapons for those bitches. I dont get why people have such a huge problem with BoM. No worse than the spam fest that goes on with a lot of other weapons, and I happen to find BoM the easiest to counter :D 




 I still don't understand how the motion control crap works. Alls I know is I occasionally perform the most inopurtune gesture that you can't cancel easily like in DaS  




 Yeah. Unique and fun weapons like Dragon bone fist and majestic greatsword were fun to fuck around with too.  




 You mean Christians?  Sounds like Christians to me :D 




 Whoa... let me just adjust my in-foil hat for this one...and.... yes!  I totally agree!  He is in fact Laurence and imposter Isofeka and the blood minister from the beginning of the game all at once even! 




 Yeah, but pre DLC, you could aquire double digit slabs easy in the course of the main game, and once they released the expansions, you could swim in them.  Sure, you couldn't upgrade every weapon right away, but there were too many similar and samey weapons in that game anyhow. 




 Ha.  No sweat.  You had started off our earlier discussion fairly level headed, so I thought it was a bit strange that you were all-of-a-sudden throwing out completely irrelevant evidence and ideas :)


That being said, now I'm curious about this whole "gherman isn't gherman" thing, which, I think is a ridiculous idea and there is no reason or evidence to believe so, but still, I'm curious... 




 Ah, I've only seen a few gargoyles here or there in chalice dungeons, and no, never saw a chunk drop in there, but it's not like I farmed the gargoyles either :D 




 Wow.  Someone sure is feeling murderous today, huh? :D 




 Just wait for the next two bosses!  I'd rather fight 3 keepers at the same time over them!  The hot dog is one of the worst, but if you have the patience and are super careful, you can beat him really easily, you just can't really fuck it up at all, and either way, it will just take a long ass time.  As for the keeper, on my STR toon I just parried/visceraled her and duked it out old fashioned style, and on my SKL toon, I kept the keeper stun-locked with R1 spam from Blades of Mercy, then knocked her to the floor with beast-roar once I ran out of stamina, then I rinsed, and repeated till she died.  She escaped it once or twice and killed me once or twice, but I just whomped her that way for simplicity's sake  :D


Edit:  And your level is fine. 94 is plenty high to do any of the game. 




 I have yet to get a chunk in a dungeon, from a gargoyle enemy or anywhere else.  Can they be found in chests or on the ground or something in chalices?  Or just from enemies? 




 Those are two distinct differences though, as the imposter actually has dialogue and is voiced by two separate actors, whereas the apprentice only exists on an item description, so I fail to see the point of your reasoning?. 




 So you can dupe and glitch, but then you can't carry those characters forward and keep them?  That doesn't sound all that worth it :/ 




 I think it took me 4 or 5 vicerals to kill him in NG+ with the +30 and +20% visceral runes :D 




 There are plenty of one-offs and non-sequitters in these games.  Not everything is long and well-crafted and intertwined through the whole story.  This may or may not be one of those one-offs, but the point remains, it can be read and interpreted in either manner, with no concrete evidence favoring one over the other.  Read it as you choose. 




 Even if they are low level, at the least they probably have +9 or +10 weapons, with possibly the best gems farmed from chalice dungeons or late game, or maybe they've duped a zillion chunks and rocks (not sure if it works on gems).  This is why I said *'best to run to end game to make your toon more competitive in PvP,'* meaning, some of these people could have built these toons week 1 or 2 of BB's release (or even more recently), and they have had many days and weeks on their characters to farm for better gems and fully upgrade all their primary gear to +9 or +10, on top of finding the best gems.  (Also, they might have their gems, weapons and builds better itemized than you).


Edit:  Like the guy above said, I've "speed ran" my three PvP toons to end game to have decent gems and all primary weapons at +9 or +10, and I'm still clearing out chalices on a few of them.  And by speed-run, I mean, it only takes a night or two of gamplay to get the runes, the levels, and the primary weapons I need to +9 or +10, and to pretty much be at end game, and have my toon where he can hold his own.


Edit 2:  As for your damage, double check with the guide to make sure you are gemming your weapon properly.  Ie., you might be gemming your hunter's axe for pure physical damage, yet, only most of the weaker, 1H attacks are physical damage for the HA, where all the 2h heavy attacks are calculated as blunt damage.  Thus, if you gem the hunter's axe for all physical damage, but only use heavy blunt 2h attacks, then you are heavily crippling your potential damage output. 




 And the saves will be compatible?  1.0 will run the current characters from 2.0 or whatever the current build is?  And then once you upgrade the current build will be comptaible with your characters you took from 2.0 to 1.0?  If so, hell yeah!


 




 Fast track was Isofeka's clinic glitch, but I heard they fixed that, which is kinda obnoxious if you've already leveled a toon or two normally and want to create some different builds to get into PvP ASAP and stay competitive in PvP.  My one regret is I didn't level up an arcane and a quality toon while that was still available.


I'd say your best bet is to play the game through towards end game as normal so you can get enough upgrade materials and ruins to make the build you want and stay competitive - and it shouldn't take that long as the game is super short, especially once you are more familiar with it.  You could also create a totally viable and competitive PvP build at level 60-90 with decent gear and a +8 or 9 main weapon with minimal time investment, but it depends on what you are looking for.  Back to the first point - playing through the main game will also give you some practice since you might be playing with weapons and items you aren't familiar with (ie., going from a main STR build to a PvP BT or SKL build).  A lot of people insist on 50 vitality as a must for all PvP toons due to the invader 30% health debuff, and while it almost helps in making up for that stupid handicap, it isn't necessary, though I do notice I tend to win more when I'm the one being invaded, and not doing the invading.  All that being said, you don't need to min-max in this game to be successful.  As with all the souls games, superior individual player skill will always win out over superior items, upgrades, runes, and so forth.  Good luck to you~ 




 Well, there are a lot less things to upgrade in BB, but at least slabs were super common in DaS2, and chunks could eventually be purchased, and twinklings and dragon bones (the hardest to collect en masse) were super easy and quick to farm too, especially once you got to the late game, and they were at least guaranteed spawns.  Like farming in any game, it is a pretty obnoxious time sink and poor design imo, but it is and was still better than upgrade item availability in BB  :/ 




 To be fair. BSB's poison AIDS is no joke. And you're probably not too terrible if you made it to BSB period. Yes te game game gets harder, but you will likely become better at it. Take a break and come back later. Sometimes that's all you need for these games :D 




 Not really. It is just subtle and cryptic, which FROM does quite often and quite well.  




 Well, he never really befriends you, he just doesn't try to kill you. But yes, you can still talk to him so long as you enter old yharnam through the back route. But be careful, I don't know if killing the hunter below makes him permanently hostile or not, so don't engage either in combat. Just come back later after you've unlocked the short cuts an you can make your way up all those ladders to talk to him.  




 Hehe.  Bet it sucked to be him! 




 Thanks for the info.  I was just looking at the game on steam, and it seems smarter to pay 20 dollars to upgrade DaS2 on the Pc, rather than having to pay full price for SoTFF elsewhere :D 




 Hey all.  I've been lost in Bloodborne since release (which I bought a PS4 for), and I have been thoroughly enjoying both the PvE and the PvP, but I did want to eventually pick up SoTFF.  I played the hell out of DaS2 on PC, and while part of me doesn't want to pay for the same game again, I was curious what my fellow hardcore Souls fans thought of SoTFF, as well as if anyone had some ideas as to which system it plays best on?  Or what the main differences are, as I've read the graphics were over-hauled for both PC and console versions.  (For reference, I have a PS4 and a PC to choose from, no XBox1)


That being said, how is the funcionality of the different systems?  I prefer to game on PC, because my PC performs better than the PS4, better graphics, I like keyboards, etc (though I still play Souls games with a controller), but I heard that the console versions can support up to six persons in a multiplayer game?  But the PC release doesn't?  Any other big differences like that between them?


And in general, what have you guys thought of SoTFF so far?  Is it true that SoTFF comes with all three DLC's?  Thanks in advance for your responses  :) 




 Again, it is very well-written, and one of the most beautiful gems in the whole of the first game was the easy-to-miss, right-under-your-nose hint dropped in your first NPC encounter of the game:


Oscar the Fateless straight up says, "...Regrettably, I have failed in my mission... *But perhaps you can keep the torch lit...* There is an old saying in my family... Thou who art Undead, art chosen..."


The whole "keep the torch lit" is a direct reference to the kiln of the first flame, and yet, you would have never known it your first time through, and even on subsequent play-throughs, it is absolutely easy to miss this tasty and subtle reference.  Again, that's good writing  :D 




 Right, which would likely be a bastardized, incestuous dose of the Queen's blood.


Did you ever play Dark Souls?  There is an exact similar situation at the beginning of that game, where FROM does the exact same thing - they allude to a very specific piece of information that you would just never understand or 'get' on your first play through (or ever for that matter if you are inattentive).  I don't want to say it in case you've never played it cuz spoilers... 




 I like how literal and hidden in plain-sight you can take the translation. That blood in the beginning?


"Where's an outsider like you to start?  With a little bit of *Yharnam* blood of your own."  


He could be literally injecting you with queen Yharnam's blood. And yes, I suppose it could be menstrul blood, or from the afterbirth.  




 Bingo. I just posted this a little while ago:


Ah, but you are just reading it a particular way:  "Bone of an old hunter whose name is lost."  It doesn't say "bone that *came from* and old hunter whose name is lost."  While there are thigs to be lost and found in translation, that is still a massive difference in language use. The item description clearly tells us the one who used it was an apprentice of Gherman, but it does not clearly say where it comes from. Think about that :D

 Yep. And to be honest, I don't really care for the different physical attack values, but maybe there was good reason for it. If all attacks were just physical, they probably would have had to tone every weapon down to do less damage.  




 That, and it wouldn't make sense to have blunt/thrust go through a double dip for damage mitigation. It would essentially mean all thrust and blunt stacks would be weaker due to stacking defense types, which would be quite retarded.  




 Honestly, FROM has been a revitalizing force in what has been the stagnant industry of gaming, aside the already well established formulas, and the one offs and innovative indie studios. 


I warn you - if you pick up bloodborne, it will likely ruin gaming for you, and if you play the previous souls titles, every other game will feel like hello kitty island adventure where you run around with a bunch of school girls slapping each other with wet noodles, and hardly any game out there will even come close to the satisfaction, risk, reward, and enjoyment of playing a game made by FROM Soft...


You have been warned.  




 That is a very keen connection, and a very cool theory. Can we run with that? 




 Yeah. I'm too used to playing with the sweeping motion of the larger weapons too, so the spread just seemed unnecessary for me I suppose.  




 Right. They seem to recover a bit quicker, but you can spam it again in a split second if you so choose anyhow. Again. Personal preference I guess. I don't like the way the shotguns handle :D 




 Not to split hairs, but "It was said" and "He was" are two very difference ways of saying something.  But now that you have me thinking about it, the only other hunter in game we encounter who uses quickening (if I'm not mistaken) is the Chikage hunter in the grand cathedral.  Do you think that is the same apprentice that is mentioned int he description of the old bone?  I know the guide calls him "The cainhurst crow" or whatever, but it still gives us nothing definitive...  




 Whoa, slow it down professor!  Are you sure?  Let me write this down. 




 At point blank they can do some damage, but pistols stagger beasts just the same as the shotguns.  The shotguns have a wider arc, which just seems to promote sloppy play, and why bother with a pellet spread when you can swing a wide weapon like the axe or scythe or sword and stagger a group of enemies just the same, or use a beast roar, or throw a molotov or any number of options that actually do more damage or provide you with more utility.  I just tend to find that nearly every other item/weapon in the game has better utility than the shotguns, the exception being the rifle spear, because it allows you to parry while 2handing a transformed weapon.  Again, this is my personal preference and play-style, and I was over-all kind of dissapointed that the shotguns didn't have a more unique and effective usage. 




 The repeater pistol outdamages Eveylyn at high Blood tinge, but that is because it fires two bullets, and you go through your resources faster that way.  Being that it can be easy to miss with bullets, I found Eve to be the better choice, as it is accurate and fires fast, and other than having fun playing with the rifle spear (non-bugged version), I've found absolutely no real use for the pellet spread of the blunderbuss or shotgun type weapons.  Sure, it is supposed to do damage, but that damage is negligible outside of a blood tinge build (especially in NG+ cycles, depth 5 chalices, etc), since your focus isn't on playing a ranged build.  


That being said, is this for PvP or PvE?  Because I've found no reason to use anything but the hunter's pistol for non Blood-Tinge builds in PvE.  The pistol fires fast, is accurate, and you can shoot enemies at point blank (unlike the Eve which is too long, and will often shoot past enemies or other players at point blank range).  There is the blunderbuss, but I found it to be slow, clunky, and the damage it does in no way justifies how it leaves you more open to attacks on account of how slow it is.  Then there is the repeating pistol, which does more damage, but that is only because it uses twice the resources.  If you are thinking about the damage your guns can do, it doesn't really matter as much when you're not a BT build.  It's about utility and it becomes more of a personal preference or what you think is fun and stylish, though I can't speak about ludwig's holy rifle and the modifier of holy damage, as I don't know that much about it.


As for other reasons to increase your gun damage, sure, occasionally an enemy will have a slice of HP left after a fight, and it can be convenient to shoot them once or twice to kill them, but again, it isn't needed or warranted if that's not how you've dedicated your build, though it depends on your playstyle.


At the end of the day, weapon damage in the souls games comes down to the conservation of movements.  Take for example an enemy that has 3000 health, be it PC or NPC.  Let's say you set out to kill it with three gunshots leading into three visceral attacks.  If your gun does 200 points of damage, and your visceral attacks do 800 points of damage, then you kill the enemy in those six moves:  gun shot parry+visceral, gun shot parry+visceral, and one more gun shot parry+visceral for a total of 3000 damage.  The enemy is now dead.


Then let's say you decide to pump your bloodtinge, so your gun shots now do 250 damage (up from 200).  It might seem handy or helpful to have that little extra damage, as sometimes we do find ourselves dying in a situation where an enemy only has a tiny slice of life left and one more gunshot would kill it, but the fact remains that in the same scenario above, it doesn't change the amount of attacks it takes to kill an enemy:

1st parry+visceral = 1,050 damage - enemy has 1950 HP left now

2nd parry+visceral = 1,050 damage - enemy now has 900 health left

3rd parry+visceral - 1,050 damage - enemy is now dead, but the damage added through pumping another 10-20 points in BT is negligible, because he would have been dead anyway, and thus you wasted points in BT.


I know people can argue any number of ways on this, but imo BT and gun damage is useless outside dedicated builds, and thus the weapon you use is a matter of personal preference, be it for effectiveness, feel, or style, and I've just found the regular old Hunter's Pistol to be too damn awesome and reliable to not use, and it is easy enough to get it to +9 (along with your other favorite weapons) to where you can use it as viable damage output should you find yourself facing off with an enemy who winds up with a tiny sliver of health left (though less so in depth 5 chalices and higher NG+ cycles).  Hope this helps, now go hunt in style!  o/


edit:  grammar/clarity

Edit 2:  Back to the reliability of the pistol - it staggers enemies just the same as the blunderbuss, but it is just faster and super accurate :D
 




 Unless you're going full or super-high BT build, I wouldn't bother with Evelyn, as the Hunter's Pistol is on par for damage with it until like, early 20's bloodtinge.  And if you are going to invest that much in BT (Eve requires 18 I think, which is a lot for non-primary damage), and you don't pump it up more to use a chikage, you are pretty much gimping what could otherwise be a higher damage, more focused skill build, or wasting what could be a full (40-50) bloodtinge build with a good 20-25 in skill, utilizing your stats best with chikage as your main weapon and eve for damage and utility.  


If you want or care to do actual damage with your firearm, yes, I'd say go full BT or a skill/BT build with eve and/or rifle spear and chikage, but if you are just using firearms for utility, then waste as few possible points in BT as you can get away with:D 




 Would love to spar sometime this weekend.  I have 3 semi-complete PvP builds that are staying around level 90-98, but I'm not sure of the best way to do so in this game since there are no soap stones, and passwords don't affect PvP. I imagine the best way to do it is by grabbing the first root chalice available and using that glyph. What do you think?


Edit:  not sure I I'll have the time to grind out the chalices on all/any of my PvP toons just yet, as I'm pretty sure the hunter tombs key chalice is required for chalice PvP 




 I'm not seeing it. Also, I'd likely suspect lag as being the culprit :D 




 I think the final allure in this game (like the other souls titles) is PvP, and challenge runs. Ie, like someone below said, it isn't about just getting gear. It is about the challenge itself, such as the triple offering dungeons 




 Stun lock on lesser foes. You should be able to own most enemies in les than 1 bar of stamina, and for total pwnage, for a measly total 15 points of investment in arcane, you spam until your stamina is gone, then use beast roar ASAP to knock them over, and by the time the enemy stands up again, you should have enough stamina back to rinse and repeat. 


For multiple enemies, I'd suggest either playing unlocked for quick turning to be able to stab whoever is coming at you, or be quick to flick the lock on to whoever gets closest, enabling you to still spam constantly without getting swarmed, though with how bad the camera can be at times, it might get you killed until you are more accustomed to it. 


Eit:  I hate using BoM for PvP though. Sure, im not practices enough with them in PvP to really speak to their power, but Between the lack of range and the latency of multiplayer, I can't stand using them against other players :D 




 Tots casul troll. But the point remains. She is an way boss. 


Edit:  just realized he said no heal run. That's insane. I'm pretty far on my level 4bro that I don't play too often, but I imagine i'd get quite sick of an angry at the game if I tried that.  




 I either stockpile them early to get a few levels, save them for when I want to splurge on consumables, or use them to push me over the edge to be able to level later in the game.  As for the mad-men's wisdoms, I wouldn't use those until you need them, since a brain-sucker might steal them, and there is no shortage of insight in the game.  I tend to use insight/wisdoms to purchase armors and crafting materials at the insight vendor. 




 Dude, if you're anything like me, you hate the cane.  The poke/poke of the cane is fun and effective, but the whip is slow, and does low damage, and pretty much every other weapon with a little bit of reach (ie, wide slahes of rifle spear) do a better job of staggering or knocking over enemies and doing crowd control.  The cane has a certain cool factor to it, especially when imbued with fire as it looks amazing, but I found it to be far too weak, and slow as shit in whip mode, and it seems to be outclassed by every other longer-ranged weapon in game, particularly the axe or burial blade.  I didn't do a whole playthrough with rifle-spear, but I did play through half the game with it, but it was one of my favorite and most fun weapons to play with, though it was a bit weak compared to the damage I could do with some of the other weapons (and no, I'm not talking +flat arcane bug).  It just depends on what movesets and abilities you like. 
























 So sarcastic and passive aggressive. You must have a really well-groomed vagina. You sorry saps are doing this to yourself, bitching like a bunch of children. I'm just calling it like I see it, but hey, if you want to join in the circle-jerk of useless whining, be my guest. Not mine or any other man'd fault that you feel inferior. Here's a tip though - doing this dear diary high-school shit on reddit isn't going to help you feel better about yourself or life here on planet-motherfucker. Good luck. I hope you can work through your neuroses and emotional problems. Be a real women or man, and face up to that shit. No one wants to deal with an adult child.  




 Clearly you didn't read what I wrote. It's ok though. I'm sure commiserating with your fellow hens in the sewing circle has elevated you oh so much in their eyes, and has contributed much to your well-being, never mind how pathetic this drivel sounds, and how it benefits neither sexes, nor does anything to demonstrate emotional maturity in a man. Most of you sound like chicks bitching about your so-called friends because you are too afraid to confront them, and you aren't man enough to deal with your own feelings, whatever that may entail. Frankly, it's pathetic and disgusting. Thank gosh for te anonymity of the Internet.  




 This post is retarded.  It's cancer.  What are we, a bunch of catty hens who are low on the pecking order?  Do you guys not have balls?  Do you feel the need to hate on your fellow man to elevate yourself, as if you're some chick in the sewing circle?


I hate people who answer and thus give credence to this sort of trash, and what I hate are the obnoxious and stupid characteristics that are common in most people, sexes be damned. 




 Yep, but I hear you on the spelling/attention thing.  But even in professional fields, the standards of grammar and even things like basic sentence structure and all manners of other elements have gone to complete shit, or at least it seems that way sometimes.  Attention to details are important, and it never ceases to amaze me how many people don't pay attention, be it on their resumes, their e-mails, their text messages, or to their own goddamn life and what they are feeling and how they deal with it, period  :D


Keep up the good fight though.  I myself would allow for no more than one, two typos max on a resume ;) 




 Honestly, nothing. Men are pretty damn great. Namely, what I hate are characteristics that are common in most people, namely stupidity, willful ignorance, solopsism, and unnecessarilly catty bull-shit like this stupid post.


What I'm saying is, I hate the kind of douche-bag that would answer this, like he's some lost fucking hen who is quite low in the pecking order. The emotionally retarded and immature type of people who aren't man enough to deal with their own feelings, whatever that entails.


Honestly - what are we here?  A bunch of fucking women?


Edit:  seriously. Fuck this post.  It's cancer.  




 But there are so many, with so many nuances, that's why people specialize in just one field of it, and are hired to exploit the system and find loop-holes in said system... 




 But can't we all just get along?  Treat everyone the way you want to be treated!  Ad nauseum! 




 Either way, this is totally exciting me! 




 Awww, you didn't hire him?  But what forethought and clarity of purpose!  He would have surely been a great asset to your team! 




 Fuck yeah!  Kim is one of my fav porn stars! 




 You nailed a good few of them.  I'd add Whitney Cummings, and about most of the other American female comedians out there, among a bunch of the guys as well :D 




 You have good taste my friend.  May you be blessed by Patton Oswalt and his over-rated fat-ass being hit by Whitney Cummings plane as it crashes down from the sky. 




 I love that guy, but there was a point in one of his own specials where he even seemed to be sick or tired of working that schtick.  His broader, farther-reaching bits about humanity, social interaction, human connectivity, and the paints of being a parent are all solid and hillarious though.  Worth noting, saw him live, and with not much material on the former, he was fucking hillarious.  Probably the hardest I've ever laughed in my life :D 




 Not just that, but she's super fucking lame and her material is absolute shit...   




 He is/was a comedian? :P 




 Don't forget a lot of American female comedians as well...  they're just...not funny. 




 Eh, if popculture and Itunes have taught us anything, it's never underestimate the public's ability to gulp down copious amounts of shit-stained swill.  I wouldn't bet on it. 




 Your tub!?  That's her tub too buddy! 




 But he was doing you a favor? 




 What a great way to attract talent!  Don't mind the colorful language and boob-grabbing! 




 So many crushed dreams, so many idiots... 




 Was he qualified?  I mean, while I can appreciate cheekiness on either side of the table, it seems a lot of arbitrary standards, bias, opinions, and negative experiences and conditioning get in the way of the interview process, which sort of makes you sound like an ass-hole :D 




 Book smart?  That's just a term stupid people use to justify their lack of smarts :D 




 But look at her willingness to do dirty jobs and take on huge problems that are seemingly impossible to her!  Clearly she would have been an all-star employee!  Tell me you hired her! 




 But, if you had a sense of humor, would you have hired him?  :P 




 Cuz hell yeah for teen pregnancy and shitty, immature parents :D 




 They had their eyes on the prize!  Clearly they were a focused individual!  How could you not hire them!? 




 Dude!  How could you not have hired him?  Clearly he shows creativity and innovation when it comes to solving problems!  As for the rest?  Well, he doesn't give a fuck! 




 It sure seems there are a lot of stupid, ignorant, strange, and lazy people on the interviewee side of the table, but I'd like to hear about the idiots on the other side.  Thanks in advance for your replies :) 




 Well, I can't speak on that, but if you're posting related materials/comments in perfectly suitable posts and sub-forums, then the moderators have no business perma-banning someone.  Judging by the way they are quick to ban people for seemingly no good reason without giving said people a chance to explain anything (as if it should be needed in some of these cases), I'd say they have itchy trigger-fingers. 




 Whoa...just, whoa... on all of that D: 




 Such dedication though! 




 Project 1999 as a game is pretty great, but Honestly, whoever regulates those forums seem to be completely humorless and unaware of appropriate context and forum topics. I was banned within a few hours of posting a few comments that were completely in-line and relevant to the topics I was replying too. It seems they are power-hungry control freaks who have a hard time understanding people, language, context, etc. don't take it personally, but that forum is kinda fucking stupid :) 




 What if he really is the best - and you missed out on an opportunity to hire an amazing worker?


That being said, yes, he sounds like a dick, but I love how little nuances and things that those who are hiring choose to take offense at are so subjective and dependent on their own experiences and bias.  I wonder how many people who would be perfect fits at certain jobs and companies wind up being passed over because the hiring manager/HR/boss/whatever chose something asinine to be annoyed at, or projected their own personal issues onto the hiree  :D 




 Wow...  just wow.  Couldn't you have told them both to get off the planet period, and fired them from their sorry attempts at being human beings?  You would have done us all a great favor  :D 




 Hey, you'd be upset too if you had semen in your eye! 




 Bwahahahaha.  Simpsons did it first anyhow.  Your day:  0  Me:  1 




 That's what he gets for trying to steal your TV!

 I'd opt for less vitality and go for 15 arcane, as the hunter's tools are awesome for PvP and PvE (specially beast roar), as well as a bit more skill.  




 Perfect for costume parties, or murdering people in the early AM hours of the morning!  Absolutely frightening! 




 Yeah, I just noticed that yesterday as a matter of fact - yes they are.  From the side-views of those attack animations you can see them fairly clearly and easily.  Between that, and the wintern lanters' brains being composed of seemingly dead messengers, it seems that a lot of the nightmare creatures are somehow made out of twisted/perverted messengers, which leads me to believe the messengers are messengers of the MP or some other great one, and since the great ones seem to have different methods and goals, that the Mensis school likely experimented or flat out somehow enslaved and warped some of the messengers, somehow. 




 TIL that god is an asshole that likes to destroy churches.  Consequently, TIL to stay the hell out of churches. 




 TIL that Muslims who don't even live in the middle east are still simple-minded, short-sighted, self-centered assholes with stupid concerns and beliefs. 




 Wow.  What a bunch of presumptuous assholes of so-called friends.  You don't need stupid people like that in your life.  That being said, stop trying to buy/impress friends in that manner. 




 Wait, what?  What bridge wolves?

 It looks like full metal alchemist meets dead space meets bloodborne? :D 




 Actually, no.  I was much more specific than you, namely in regards to maximizing the potential of the physical/arcane split weapons.  But, you're welcome.  BLEAAAAAAAAAARGHEEVOMIIIIIIIIIIIIIIITREGURGITATIONEBLEAAAAAAARGH! 




 24 Episodes is fine with me for any series, really.  I mean, especially the way anime tends to draw itself out and all :D

Will definitely check this out. 




 Uuuuh, what show is that?  I need to watch it! 




 Those split arcane weapons are not meant to be optimized via the arcane stat, they are meant to be maxed via the +% physical and flat arcane damage gems, as their base arcane damage is super low.


That being said, it isn't awkward, you just have to have the uncanny burial blade (cuz the regular one with waning gem slot sucks), and you can take that AR upwards of 600 relatively easy, and that is with regular depth 5 chalice drops, not the more rarer, top-of-the-line rank 20 gems or abysmal gems from bosses.  The BoM are even more OP with those odd gems, because it hits like a truck, and it hits super fast.


That being said, the problem is, it is way more work and effort to do all that, rather than say, get a ludwigs which is basically OP out the gate, even with mediocre % physical gems on it.  Plus, it can be enchanted.  This is why everyone likes and uses ludwigs - because it is easy to obtain, and easy to increase the damage with little to no chalice farming or work.  It's a total bummer that certain builds and weapons in this game are so lop-sided when it comes to optimizing them and staying competitive :( 




 Riflespear is fun as shit to play with, but it is very mediocre in damage, hell, even reach, unless you are talking about the riflespear bug, which is bad to base a more permanent build around, since it will likely be fixed via patch soon enough.  I used the riflespear exclusively on my BT and SKL build characters until I obtained better weapons in late game (cuz I hate the cane), and again, while distinct and fun, the riflespear is easily outclassed in both range and damage by the axe, or ludwigs, and most anything else.  That, and if you are talking about the riflespear bug, it will likely take him awhile to get to a place to farm the correct gems to make it bugged/OP. 




 Right. And the arcane scaling on the split weapons is shit and not meant to be optimized via the arcane stat, and you gimp the split weapons if you only put %physical gems on them as well.  those weapons are meant to be boosted using the gems I mentioned, as the arcane stat itself makes almost no difference on them. 

The split weapons aren't suppose to be turned into pure arcane either, because they have low base arcane damage and scaling in the first place, and wind up just as gimpy if you try to use them that way. 

Edit:  the tonitrus is optimized via elemental damage gems, which are a lot harder to farm. Or at least, more obnoxious. 


Edit 2:  to be clear, I'm trying to tell you why those split weapons are the way they are, and how an and how to properly utilize their stats.  




 Actually, the corect gems for BoM and Burial blade are the +phys % and +flat arcane.  You can make your Burial blade 600+ AR easily this way, and same thing with BoM.  That is how those should be gemmed correctly. 




 I got the perfect build for you.  It's bad-ass, sturdy, gives you access to all those tools you mentioned, and you can make several weapons ridiculously OP (though for burial blade, you need to get the uncanny version to be able to put in all +phys % gems and flat arcane damage, as the waning gem slots suck ass).  That being said, Rosmarinus wouldn't be the focus here, as you will top off at 15 arcane, though you could move the stats around, but 25 end is good to be able to use the different weapon combos out there.  Anyway, here is the awesome OP build that makes you shine for quality weapons and SKL weapons, but you could also viably use some STR weapons just for the hell of it if you didnt want to be too op:

40 Vit

25 End

25 STR

50 SKL

5 BT - dont add any into this, as you don't need it for anything, and fuck anything other than hunter's pistol anyhow for non BT builds :P

15 ARC


There is your 110 build if you start with Cruel Fate (has only 5 blood tinge).  You can adjust the Vit/end/SKL to your liking, but with this build and the correct weapons and gems, you can have a 650-700 AR Burial Blade, a 600 AR BoM, and a 850-950 AR Ludwig's (stupid, right?) with the phantasm shell.  Have fun!


Edit:  Thanks to my mate here on reddit who showed me how ridiculously awesome this quality build is :D

 




 He is the only truly altruistic character in the story, and he says as much, dialogue along the lines of "I only wanted to help," and something about his family telling him he was wrong.  He is just a genuinely friendly, creepy, dude. 




 Which is a shame, cuz it's a fun weapon to use.  I used it exclusively until I got the burial blade and BoM on my skill build, cuz I hate the cane  




 How many hundreds of hours did you play DaS2?  :P


Funny, for being such a terrible game, all the FROM fans still played it more than any other game out there.  The best way to put it is, DaS2 is a fantastic RPG game, but it is not a fantastic FROM game :D 




 It looked pretty damn good on my PC.  That being said, what all the DaS2 whiners meant (even after they played the game for hundreds and thousands of hours, and ejoyed it) is, DaS2 is a fantastic RPG game, and it was still game of the year in 2014, but it is the least souls-like of the souls games.  It is a great RPG game, just not a great FROM game :D 




 Fuck all the whiners.  They still played it more than any other game out there, they still put 100's to 1000's of hours on it, and it was still the best game of 2014, hands down.  No other game, even AAA, had the same replayability and diversity DaS2 had, especially for PvP.  I love how people will say, "it's a terrible game, I only played it for 1000 hours"...  like, really?  What the fuck dude?  


But I get what they mean.  What all the DaS2 whiners are trying to say (and the best way to put it is), DaS2 is the best RPG game of all the Souls games, but it is the least Souls-like of all the souls games, or at least, the most deficient of the souls games when it comes to all the little quirks and nuances that made the souls games great.


That being said, DaS2 easily has the best PvP and matchmaking of all the games (aside soul memory), and definitely has the best variety in terms of weapons/armor (even if it is redundant), but even that is great, as the fashion options are spectacular! 




 Hahaha.  Yep.  when I think Oedipus complex, I think of children wanting to bang their mothers... 




 LOL 




 I hope they do fix it, as I love this wepaon and find it very fun to play with it, even though without the bug, it is kinda weak compared to other weapons, it can still be pimped out quite nicely :D


That being said, like any other obviously OP or broken shit, I don't see it as a matter of will they fix it, but when will they fix it?  :D 




 Haha.  He sucked and died, in that order :D 




 The DLC in DaS was cut content that they just didn't have time to put in the original game, and that content was fantastic and worth it's entertainment dollar a hundred times over.  The DLC in DaS2 went hand-in-hand with the story, but I still think it was more of an after-thought (or at least, not like it was going to be implemented in original game), BUT, the DLC for DaS2 was the highlight of the game, with some of the best game-design and challenging bosses and some great new items and weapons.


The point is, I will buy DLC for Bloodborne in a heart-beat, whether it was intended content that was cut due to time-constraints, or an after-thought :D 




 Yeah - I hear ya on the checklist thing.  After a while it becomes mechanical, especially when you've done them on more than one character.  I actually enjoy creating my own due to the mystery of them, or trying out other people's glyphs, but the story-line chalices became redundant the second time around.  At the least, I would have enjoyed some different tile sets and lay-outs, or even more interesting would have been a wave-like enemy arena or boss challenge.  I think that would have fit just fine into the game, and really showcase the enemies as well as the player characters :D 




 So OP! 




 There is an enemy in the guide called "Izzy's admirer," though I can't remember who it was for.  I think it was an NPC hunter... 




 On my first NG ever I was able to stunlock him to death with a hunter's axe and 20 stamina.  I dont think he even had a chance to attack.  Same thing went on my BoM run.  Guy is ridiculously easy and under-powered, especially for being such a burly looking monster.  I wish he was as challenging as he looks :/ 




 Really?  I didn't know you could die to this guy?  Not trying to be a smart-ass, but I thought this was a terrible boss fight due to how easy he is.  Seriously, if you just look at him he becomes stunlocked :D
 




 I still felt bad killing her.  Even as a beast, she is kinda pretty and majestic.  Also, feel free to use "Ron the Funky Caterpillar" too :D 




 There should be a "you're gonna die," emote, or at the least, something like "careful, this aint NG" :D 




 Yep.  To me she is the Reindeer Beast of Christmas Past :D 




 Bingo. My guess is they'd need a larger amount of time to change it more than they did in making the gameplay swifter, yet still weighty. I love the game as well, and the only bad part is that the superb level design hides how short the game really is. Chalice dungeons are pretty cool, and a great feature overall, but I just wish they had time for more tile sets :D 




 Yes, for other content, not game-changing mechanics.  Don't start the blind hype-train all over again... 




 I agree for the most part, and fuck all that blind-hype-train crap people got all worked up over anyhow.  Disapointment is what happens when you have blind, unfounded expectations.  A lot of it seemed too complicated and convoluted and exclusive anyhow.


That being said, decent covenants with a a slight modicum of depth would have been welcome, but as it stands, the covenants in BB are the lamest and most shallow to date.  The covenants in previous games all had motives, rewards, and mechanics related to them, and BB pretty much completely lacks that.  For that and mainly that, I am dissapointed :( 




 What's that you say?  You miss losing more and more of your HP meter like in Dark Souls 2?  :D 




 Yep.  And that dissapointment is what people get for hopping on the blind-ass hype-train.  Don't know why people chose to believe in that shit and actually put their expectations on it in the first place :/ 




 Well, as far as I can tell, that was all speculation, and people blindly got on the hype-train, and surprise surprise when FROM didn't have some sort of in-depth transformation mechanic and covenant system, especially to the degrees that players expected it.  


And it's funny that people somehow expected these crazy covenants and transformations and blood mechanics, yet what we wound up is the most hands-off, lamest, shallow and bland covenant systemto date :/


All that being said, it's still the best game of 2015 so far, and likely will stay that way, and hey, at least Play Station 4 has one good game on it :) 




 Eh, that's what happens when people got on the speculation hype-train with no proof.  Even if those were the original ideas (which I don't think they were) it would have probably been far too ambitious, and be super hard to balance, and who needs balance when you have ludwig's holy blade anyhow? :D 




 My thoughts:  if that was indeed the case and the idea (as I thought all that was just speculation, and not actually from FROMsoft), it was probably too ambitious, and they had to simplify it quite a bit :/ 




 You're welcome.  Have fun :D 




 You can't just create any random dungeon glyph (even with all necessary materials) unless you've already created a dungeon of that specification.  So if you wanted to make a 'cursed ihyll' of a specific glyph, you first have to make a 'cursed ihyll' of your own.  


Provided you have all the materials you need, you go to a blank gravestone, use 'condust chalice ritual,' option, and make the parent dungeon.  Once that dungeon is created, then you can go to another gravestone and then you can use the 'find glyph' option or whatever it's called to look up the specific dungeon you wanted to run, and you can create it, all without having to use your own materials.


So, if you wanted to run a specific 'cursed loran' glyph, you couldnt create a 'cursed isz' dungeon and expect to access cursed loran, but if you did create a cursed isz dungeon of your own, you could access any cursed isz chalice glyph out there by looking it up the same way mentioned above via glyphs.


Lastly, supposedly if you create a parent dungeon of your own, with all offerings, you can access any and ALL combination of those offerings via glyphs.  So if you created a cursed/fettid/rotten Ihyll, you could join any ihyl glyph, even if it was only 'cursed and fettid.'


Good luck~ 




 Have you created a chalice with those specifications already (ie, cursed/fetid/rotten)?  You have to create a chalice of that type already first, and then you can pull up the glyphs that fall under it, without having to spend your own chalice materials. 




 Yeah. Tiny tonitrus us can be pretty color though, and te cheap 15 ones (shell and paw) are definitely worth it.  




 Or how complicated the races and their primarily religious emotions and other factors are :/ 




 Have you ever been to jail?  All these tough ass motherfuckers for all their street cred who act like bad-asses immediately start bitching to their baby-sitters, the deputies, saying shit like,

"I need a band-aid"


"I need to be taken out of general because I stubbed my toe"


"I need to schedule a doctor's appointment because I spilled my milk"


I dont say this to justify the negligence on behalf of the cops, but put yourself in their shoes for a second and know that they hear all these tough guys who cop to their crimes to their fellow thugs turn into instant pussies as they try to escape the consequences of their actions, and it happens everyday, all the time.  And of course, for the street-cred, they did it, but to the cops and authority figures, they are all innocent! 




 Yep. These open-minded, sheltered kids love to tell you to be open-minded and not racist from the safety of the ivory towers their parents paid for :D 




 Yep. It shows as much as its fatally-flawed idealistic, white-bred, well-funded, open minded liberal hipster yuppie bull-shit does. Respect people, for they are equal, I say from my sheltered, ivory tower that my parents paid for.  




 Racism itself is as old as man himself. Reddit is not classical. It is new, and racism is not unique to reddit... 




 We still calling them protestors?  Lets go even further PC with it and call them 'disadvantaged urban socio-economically oppressed urban societal victims.' 




 Yep. Maybe they chose that since arcane gives you more ranged attacks with the hunter's tools?  Either way. I don't like it. Optimizing builds shouldn't be so lop-sided - easy for physical, obnoxious and redundant for most everything else.  It should be equally challenging/easy/hard/redundant.  




 Ah, that's why.  I've only completed the glyphs I've done with two of the three rites.  I think I've yet to complete a depth 5 with all three rites (as I've just used them for farming regular gems and what not).


And yes, I don't prefer this method either.  Granted, a few extra points can be negligble, especially to skilled players, still having a lot of apparently base-line-needed gems for certain weapons being so far away and hard to get is stupid imo (again, thinking those %+flat arcane gems for BoM/burial blade). 




 Right.  I've read up on a lot of the posts about ranges, and it being similar to invading further upwards beyond the original DaS equation (akin to DaS2), but even then, I know there are a lot of stubborn people sticking to 50-80, but I suppose that is why a lot of us make multiple characters at multiple ranges :D


But I also have the urge to make a new character anyhow, because I enjoy creating them, and I have this really bad-ass Lemmy Kilmister character model saved that I want to employ as more of a main character, as I have thoroughly been enjoying the SKL build, but I think it would be fun to bring the STR up to 25 for additional weapon usage.  I know my other toon would be a good template, but I might just leave him where he is.  His face is kinda ugly :D 




 Right, but all the work to get that far and farm that much at chances to even get an abysmal gem, let alone one with perfect stats, for just one weapon?  Well, that is why people flock to using Ludwig's sword, because it is OP real quick with minimal investment in the game or farming, and it's bad-ass even with the base game gems.  


I'm super annoyed and dissapointed in how FROM made competitive weapon optimizing so lop-sided, and it's a total bummer that they made it so hard to maximize a lot of weapon's potential (ie, the uncanny burial blade, as the waning slot ruins the base-line model).  


I mean, I have multiple characters, and I've farmed a lot of chalices, and I have yet to see an abyssmal gem period 


Edit:  And that's not to say it shouldn't take farming/work/effort/frustration/redundancy to optimize our theoretical top-shelf OP Tonitrus that we've been discussing, but it's a lot of work to make simple/earlier game weapons shine, like the BoM and later the Burial Blade, and use it to its max :/ 




 An be a dex fag?  No whay! 




 I have a few PvP builds, and the most current/closest one I am using is similar to yours, though I had planned it to be primarily dex, but I wanted to make a quality build anyhow, so now I just feel like I could have the best of both worlds on one toon.  Anyway, Nathan Explosion is level 98, and his stats are:

45 Vit (I think, might be 44 or 46)

22 End

12 STR

50 SKL

8 BT (whatever starter stat was)

15 Arc


I mean, I could easily adjust it to make it closer to a quality build, but I think anything over 100-110 is too high, as it cuts out a lot of meta-ranges in PvP, and is frankly just unnecessary, as I enjoy focused builds where you have to sacrafice some power/expertise over others. 




 RACISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSM!  You're so racist!  Stop justifying brutal america's crooked cops purposefully oppressing the socio-economically disenfranchised urban youths!


Just kdiding.  In all seriousness, so sick of the politically-correct bull-shit and people who choose to sympathize with stupid and ignorant people.  But hey, who needs to change when you have the perfect, perpetual victim card?  Change aint a one-way street. 




 Here's another reply for you:  Bolt (and fire) scaling works off arcane, right?  Have you tried optimizing the Tonitrus on your quality build?  How do the stats and the damage look with nore STR than arcane?  If you have tested it out for max damage on that build, what's gems have you used so far, and what does the final damage output look like? 




 And now I want to build a new character based on your quality build, as it sounds like it optimizes a lot of weapons and can make for a very diverse character... but man oh man, running all those chalices again...  :( 




 My Skill build is at 98, and close to this, with a few less end, a few more vit points, and only 12 STR.  It is tempting to move him towards this quality direction and open up so many more options on who and what is my favorite character, but I really don't want to level him up any more :( 




 Yeah.  I don't think I've seen gems like that, though I could check on my main to see if he has anything remotely close, though he is mostly retired.


Anyway, I ask because I wanted to make a quality build for PvP to have access to a variety of weapons (as variety is what has always made the souls games fun as fuck), yet remain competitive - so I wanted to use ludwig's (which I never really liked that much), the cleavers, and hearing that tonitrus can be pretty bad-ass on a quality build makes me happy as well :D


But first, I need to go find me an uncanny burial blade, and then I need %/flat arcane gems with less shitty negatives, and then, another blood rock... ugh.  Sometimes I really hate how they did rocks and weapon variants in this game  




 What does the damage look like on tonitrus with the %phys/flat arcane gems?  Seems like it could really shine on a STR build.


I've been farming those flat arc gems, but so far no luck, because I keep getting the shitty -HP gems, though the few -kin/beast damage are great for PvP.


Do you use the regular burial blade with its shitty waning slot, or do you use an uncanny burial blade?  Or  As it seems it would be able to possibly pump out the most damage (2 radial and a triangle gem slot) since triangle gems come as +9% physical with the +70 flat arcane damage, whereas, it's hard to find a decent waning gem for the burial blade, or at least, so far it has been, and I have that 18% physical gem found in the main game on it. 
























 Hex = easy mode imo.  And I don't mean that in a bad way, but with the two base dark orb spells alone that you can buy fairly early in the game, you have a lot of casts with them, and most bosses and enemies die in a few dark orbs, and you can breeze through most of the game.  If you use dark enchant on your weapon (my SOFS hexer uses the +10 magic mace), you can do insane damage on your one hand or two hand swings.  To compliment the build, it is easy to get some of the better caster gear pretty early too (hexer set, black set, lion mage set, etc), and most importantly is the sunset staff that comes with the hexer set.  Kill some basilisks or other mobs to get a darknight stone to enchant the sunset staff with dark, and you can have the best hexer staff in the game before you're even halfway through it.


I haven't played with a pure paladin/faith type build since early vanilla days, so I can't speak too much to that, but hexer is pretty boss, though it can be too easy/boring with pure casting.  But like I said, enchant dark weapon is killer, and you could always up your combat stats and focus on melee :D 




 Dude, as much as a PITA Iron Keep was, I had a far worse time in the cramped quarters of Earthen Peak being bled out the ass by a half dozen poison manniken fuck-less faces in those narrow hallways.  That shit was maddening:  FROM 1 / Fun 0  :D 




 I wish I could take my Scythe and Axe and BoM and etc into DaS2 :( 




 Thanks Captain Correct Acronym?  The world needs a hero like you? 




 Dude, SOTS has been fantastic.  I just started playing DaS2 SOFS a few days ago, as well as vanilla DaS2 with my RL brother, and it has been very enjoyable, though a bit clunky at first when you're used to how fast, responsive, and awesome combat in BB is.  That being said, as much as I love BB, there is a reason I sort of got bored with it in two months, and am back to playing Dark Souls 2... 




 Yeah... as much as I love BB for mostly the PvE (as the PvP is very limited), there is a reason I found myself playing SOFS after merely two months of Bloodborne... 


There really is an incredible amount of options and choices for builds, challenge runs, weaponry, fashion, general PvE well into NG+ cycles, and all that good shit in DaS2... 




 I remember doing this back when the DLC first dropped on my main, an I swear, the more you get, the less they drop.  I received my first 20 within the first few hours, but then the next 30 took two days.... 




 Never mind all the whiners, even though some of their complaints were valid.  DaS2 was still the best game of 2014, and there is a reason that even all the people who supposedly hated or disliked it still clocked hundreds of hours on it.


The best way to put it is, DaS2 is the best RPG game in the souls series, but it is the lesser of the Souls games in the Souls series.  Even then, it's not all bad, and SOFS (and the DLC for sure) helped close some of those gaps I think.  Anyway, have fun.  It's the next best game to play if you've already played the previous titles and/oror Bloodborne.  Besides, as far as the awesomeness that comes out of FROM software studios, what else can fill that gap?  :D 




 Ha!  I was playing late last night, well past my expiration date, and I swear I wanted to strangle that bitch.  Fuck her and her Majestic Magical Twinkle Sword of Infinite tracking.  Seriously.  Fuck her.  Can't wait to get home and slice of her cheesy-ass twinkle tits with your strat! 




 Enjoy your bloodborne player!  Hopefully PS4 has some more exclusives to make it even more worthwhile :D   




 Be ready to roll... imposing your ethics/honor/etc on others will only bring dissapointment, just like in real life.  Or, it might even get you killed, just like last night -_- 




 Heide Knight Iron Mask!  The missing helm to many sets, especially Alva's :D 




 For sure.  But even in vanilla DaS2, I was already getting more comfortable with two handing weapons, or dual wielding or other items, and in playing a one-bro run, I learned to be comfortable with one or two handing weapons with no shields at all, since 99% of the shields suck for a onebro, or have to be two-handed and even then they are limited and situational. 




 I have definitely been throughly enjoying it, but do you remember how much people complained about the number of enemies in most locations?  Yeah, and then they upped it for SOFS... can you imagine all that bitching, times 10?  Well, they did that anyhow, so fuck it, I think you're right.


I've never been that big of a fan of using shields, and after playing Bloodborne, I never will again, especially cuz I've been thoroughly enjoying the darker, more atmospheric places, especially with a torch.  It's been a blast for sure! 




 Really?  Just by lightning them?  I will have to check this out! 




 Dude, Earthen Peak was already bad enough with all those ass-hatless poison-douche, bleedy AIDS dick headless manniken fuckers already turning my feeble mage into a pillar of salt, and due to posts like this, I haven't even gone to Iron Keep yet...  I'm, uh, saving that place for last, after all the other three mighty dick souls 

 




 When I was a kid, like a lot of little boys, I enjoyed jumping on things.  Sometimes for fun, sometimes to assert dominance, and sometimes to break shit.  This one time, I literally broke shit, by jumping on this old plywood board out back of one of my father's friends who we were visiting out of state.  The board promptly broke, and I fell into a septic tank.  I was able to catch onto the side, and yell for help as my boots dangled in the shit, and luckily my dad came out in time to find and save me.  


TL;DR - As a kid I almost died by drowning in a septic tank.  Can't think of a shittier way to go, literally, no pun intended  :D


Edit:  Shit.  In game?  Some pretty stupid stuff, though none as supid as nearly drowning in shit :D 




 Earthen Peak totally sucks, but other than that, I am enjoying SOFS waaaaay more than I thought I would.  Well worth the 20 bucks!.  Have fun man! 




 Goddammit. Really?  I just got done having my ass thoroughly raped in Earthen Peak with those godforsaken shit head clawed manikens, and now I gotta do it all over again in iron keep?  Shit... 




 Eh, I've heard that, but when I watched the videos on the posts here about that, I just didn't and still don't see any actual change in the hand.  




 I'll say DaS2 is the better RPG game, while DaS is the better FROM/Souls game :) 




 Wow.  Thanks for the story - I didn't know that one.  I mean, so the cash shops go with F2Play games, but Vindictus' RNjesus bull-shit on top of how grifty and pay2win their cash shop is, really is the nail in the coffin to that game...  insane grinds+cash shop are no substitute for actual content and a healthy comunity, which is why end game winds up sucking so much :/ 




 All indications imply he is one of the great ones, along with Ebriatis, the mind of mensis, the Moon Presence, etc. I don't know if the lesser amygdalas are great ones, or servants or what not, but they each seem to have their own agenda. I think rom and the celestials are kin though.  




 We get kin blood from rom. There is no mention of rom or the celestials being a great one. And the fact that he is called emissary makes me think he is a middle-man; perhaps they are the new servants to the great ones post pthumerian style? 




 Ebriatis is the only great one we actually encounter in the 'physical' or 'waking' world. The rest of the lore indicates that she was left behind/abandoned when the great ones ascended, leaving the physical realm, or this facet of reality. All the other great ones we encounter are either in nightmares or some sort of dream. The inferences we are given I'd that ascension (the great ones) physical bodies are long gone (aka dead) and what they share in common wih the hunters (or dead Micolash) is that they retain their consciousness through 'force of will,' which is essentially life after death, an odd sort of immortality. 


What I'm getting at, is your inferences of the cultists tryin to bring back (or summon) a great one seem pretty spot on. It just looks like summoning them through whatever ritual they were working only brings back a horrific abortion of a great one, some twisted monster, rather than the cruel powerful being itself, though I suppose tht could have been "Squirt, son of the butcher's toilet," one of the less heard of and least popular great ones :D 




 To never work when you intend it to, and to do random gestures at the worst possible times :D 




 It's not so much that the walkthrough is cheating, it's that it is robbing you of a beautiful, once in a generation type gaming experience, as much of the excitement, fear, danger, etc. comes from the atmosphere, the unknown, and the mystery of the game-play itself, let alone the fragmented story that uses the medium of gaming in a way most games haven't even dreamed of.  FROM games are unique in this regard, and you only get one blind playthrough...

Edit:  Also, Pistol  blunderbuss in every way, besides the spread that accomodates sloppier, frantic play 




 To access any and all variants of all root dungeons (so long as you have the correct base chalices), all you need to do is create a fetid/rotten/cursed Pthumeru Ihyll Root chalice dungeon, and bam:  you can create every glyph out there.  Good hunting to you o/


Edit:  The point is, don't waste your time and materials creating lesser, specific variants (ie, a cursed isz, then a fetid/rotten loran, then a cursed ihyll).  Just make the aforementioned F/R/C Ihyll and you have access to them all. 




 Think of frenzy as a massive 70% bleed, whereas rapid poison is a tiny flat 250 damage IIRC from the guide. 




 Yes!!!!!1!  THIS!  




 Or at least assist a boss, like being summoned by the mirror knight in DaS2 :D 




 Yeah.  That sounds pretty solid.  I beat him on at least two characters on long, drawn out 20 minute fights, playing it super safe by baiting out his charge/leap/vomit attacks, but on the last few characters I got sick of it, and found facing him more aggressively (closer to your strategy) to be much more to my liking  :D 




 I always put it straightforward like this:  Dark Souls 2 is the best *RPG* game of the souls series, but it is the worst *SOULS* games of the souls series  :D


I mean, there is a reason all those people who hate DaS2 so vocally still played it ravenously for hundreds and thousands of hours :D 




 *ooooh, I am here!* only happened in the DLC unfortunately, but my gawd, that was some great DLC! 




 Don't listen to the DaS2 hate-hype, especially out of context.  Fans still played it as much and even longer than previous souls games, and it was still the best game of 2014.  


What you need to understand is where the negativity comes from:  the fact of the matter is that Dark Souls 2 is the best RPG game of the souls series, *but it is the worst SOULS game of the souls series.*  What essentially made the Souls games great (aside being weighty RPGs with high risk and reward) is sloppy, stitched on, or altogether missing at parts in DaS2.  The DLC helped make up for some lost ground there, but the fact remains that while DaS2 it is the most polished, responsive, and mechanically solid of the souls games, it is lacking in everything else wonderful that makes a Souls game :) 




 If anything, the edge comes from the fact that a BT build has a huge boost when it comes to firearms, I mean, the Evelynn.  Even without bone marrow ash, it can shave off respectable chunks of HP.  The 2h attacks of the chikage are easy enough to avoid, but either weapon is a joke once you slap in 3 +27% gems in them.  GG to whoever you fight. 




 No it's my cake-day.  You summon me! 




 Don't worry on the chalice thing - they use their own difficulty ratings, and are not buffed by the NG+ cycles.

Also, don't worry about the NG cycles affectign multiplayers.  Multiplayer seems to only be based on Blood Level, so you can connect to anyone within your range, regardless of what game cycle they are in. 




 What - you don't want to die in one and a half hits to a ludwig's holy blade with three 27% gems in it?  :P 




 Not to mention, DaS2 not only great DLC, but the content of the DLC itself, and the way in which they paced the DLC release of each of the trilogy really kept the community alive and thriving with all the crazy and interesting items and weapons, even months after its release, and in between the DLC, the multiplayer community was already thriving and plenty...


The point is, I don't see any DLC for Bloodborne being anywhere near as impactful or relevant as the equivelant DLC in DaS2.  I'm sure BB DLC will be fantastic, and I'm sure FROM will hit their stride as they almost always do, and I am sure it will be enjoyable, and I'm sure it will inject some vigor into the game and multiplayer itself, but even then, it's really hard to imagine any DLC for BB that could remedy the existent problems, as some of the problems are the very nature of the game itself.  


If I could list and remedy the few main issues, it is this:

1.  I wish they had kept the frequent/unlimited invasions of B-Team's  DaS2.  It really kept the game alive and moving, well into NG cycles and all the various PvP Options.


2.  Covenants that had slightly deeper mechanics, purpose, or usefulness.  As it stands, these are shells of possibilities.  


3.  Compared to the ease and quick nature of DaS2 (or even DaS) multiplayer, BB really was a step backwards, not just in how clunky and often non-functional or slow it is, but also in it's purpose.  We need an arena, or at least better covenant and more summon sign options for duels and fight clubs.  As it stands, while relevant in theme, the bell system fucking sucks.  


4.  Variety in items and builds.  Again, I get it that they had to focus on quality over quantity, but I think everyone was spoiled in both fashion and funcionality with the unnecessary amount of gear in DaS2.  It's like night and day.  In one game we have too much redundant yet similar gear, and in BB we have sparse yet awesome and unique gear (which I almost prefer), but the lack of build diversity is what really does it for me.


Anyway, I think this is pretty much the game we get.  We'll have to wait and see what future installments bring :D 




 Do me a favor - if you're doing steady farming, can you give me a rough estimate of dropped chunks within your time frame?  Like I said, 8 in 45-60 minutes seemed like a common concensus for a few of us here. 




 You try the eye runes?  It's been awhile since I farmed the werewolves, but last I checked (and confirmed with fellow redditors), we all had consistent results, that with low arcane stats (ranging from 5-25) and the two base eye runes, I think we could get maybe, 8 chunks within a 45 minute or hour span of time?  (worth noting, I only ever bothered killing the 4 wolves in the chapel area itself, not the 5th up in the hallway.  Figured it was quicker to just run back).  It was something that wasn't too terrible, albeit still obnoxious.  Good luck :D 




 A big element of FROM games that I feel like all FROM fans learned to deal with, is *"NO PLACE IS SAFE."*  FROM consistently pushed us out of our comfort zones, first with the gameplay itself:  no saving or loading, death meaning something via loss of progress and currency, and the PvP threat constantly hedging and blurring into the PvE threat.  


And like me (and most other FROM fans) you likely at first hated how brutal the invasions or constant uncomfortability was, but that very real fear and threat added so many juicy and delicious layers in the game.  We weren't just being challenged by the game's environment and the traps the devs laid out for us, we were being haunted by other players, and our own psyches through the immersive fear and paranoia that demanded our attention to details and the enemies and the game itself.  By constantly being pushed out of our comfort zones, by dealing with our fears, and by brutal game play, every inch of progress we made gave us satisfaction, even if it was slow and frustrating at times, and what brought real life to the game more than anything else was the base underlying premise that *"NOWHERE IS SAFE."*   This is a large part of what really made the gaming experience above and beyond most everything that was available at the time, and is still available at present.  Even if you hate hate HATE(ED) PvP in present or past FROM games, there is no denying that it added so much excitement and dread to the games...


To put it simply, Bloodborne largely removed that... 




 Right, but if 'not a souls clone' means having all the successful formulas and tropes of a FROM game, minus the longevity and variety of more content/items/weapons/builds/covenants/multi-player ease and options, than that kind of sucks :/ 




 I hear ya dude, and both you and kirkhammertime who replied have your points.  For all of DaS2's faults, it really did have a fantastic amount of challenge options, challenge runs, fashion and weapon options, and thus much diversity and fun to be had in PvP, and having worthwhile, slightly meatier covenants really extended a lot of people's play-times as well (just like in DaS).  The real problem with ravenous fans like us, is that FROM created us, and no other gaming studio out there is currently coming close to making games as mysterious, immersive, challenging, and all around enjoyable in what is simultaneously a single player yet very multi-player experience... 




 Yeah.  What's worse is, with BB being so easy to digest and be satisfied yet bored with, is that there are few worthy alternatives outside of challenging, niche indie games.  With all the redundant, safe, forumalic games out there, the only thing left for me to do at the moment is buy DaS2 SoTFF... 




 It's super quick to unlock the short cut in upper cathedral ward and run up into the chapel and kill the 4 to 5 werewolves there, then bold hunter's mark right back.  I think you can kill them quicker than you can run through cainhurst, hunting down 4 or 5 gargoyles there, and on top of that, they have a higher drop rate... 




 Yeah.  I absolutely love the charred set and use it on a few of my toons, and I was always dissapointed that the claw was on the left - like - why wouldn't you use that bad mother-sucker for viscerals? 




 Have you tried summoning people in the half HP dungeons?  I tend to find a lot of summons in cursed chalices to mostly be a liability, as you are doubling the bosses HP, yet said boss can still one-shot either of you, and depending on lag, it might not even be because the other player sucks.  As a result, I never bother summoning people for these fights.  


Strategy:  I used to fight this boss on half HP mode super slowly, baiting out his charge, his jump, or his vomit, but after killing him on a few characters, I got sick of taking 15-20 minutes for the perfect fight, and I started fighting him more aggressively, and ending the fight within 5-10 minutes, but it also depends on your build and weapons and etc.  Ludwig's and BT (chikage+eve) builds can burn this guy pretty quick, and if you have decent BT, you can hang back once you lower his HP enough and just shoot him to death. 




 This.  This right here. 




 Dark Souls is the better Souls game (better story, suspense, level/boss/game design), but Dark Souls 2 is the better RPG game (smoother, improved combat, floatier yet responsive and weighty). 


Having played BB first, DaS2 will feel like a step backwards in pace and speed, an it will feel even slower if you play DaS last. For both mechanics and stories, I'd suggest you play them in order, blind, with no google or spoilers or easy help or maps :D


Also with noting, don't pay heed to any of the people who decry and bitch about DaS2. It was still the best game of 2014, and all is fans still played it more than anything else - we were just disappointed in some of B-team's decisions and methodology, and while it was the best RPG of the series, it was at the bottom of the list for what made souls games perfect games.  




 If only destiny had a story period, or characters... God that game is a piece of shit.  




 I'm pretty sure invasions have always worked on a larger upwards scale for all or most of the FROM games? 




 Thank you, and yes, I just re-read your original post and I feel appropriately like a dummy  :)


That being said, thanks for answering me anyway, and great work on the spread-sheet.  Much appreciated!


Edit:  Do you think it would be worth adding a few notes on the easiest way to farm some of the chalice materials people sometimes sometimes find themselves lacking?  Ie.:


Tomb Mold 5 = kill the rats at the beginning of great isz chalice

sage's hair - farm the undead-sage guy right next to the lamp in layer 3 of lower loran

ritual blood 5 - farm the chest in lower ailing loran which is just a quick run from one of the first lamps 




 And is it true, that if you create a cursed/fetid/rotten pthumeru ihyll chalice, you can then create any and all variants of ihyll, isz, and loran?  There was a PSA not too long ago stating that, and I have yet to test it on my current toon.  Thanks!


Edit:  just re-read your post, and answered my own question.  thank you! 




 Don't forget, it also exists because of a lack of competition.  Most of the competition copied wow in mechanics, style, formula, give or take a few minor tweeks or dynamics, so there isn't much of an alternative.  Everyone just wanted to make the fabled 'wow-killer,' and in their rush to copy the ultimate success formula, they stifled creativity and set innovation back a decade... 




 Dude.  Tourists aside, that is still a lot of money.  They aren't going to be investing any less in WoW for the forseeable future... 




 It's not a matter of making an MMO for everyone, it's about making a solid game period, and whether that is for a large or niche audience depends on a lot of factors.  But at present, and for a long time now, there are bigger problems in the gaming world.


The problem is the gaming industry at large, who have been mostly playing it safe on boring, formulaic game-play models (which you can't blame to a degree), but the lack of forward thinking, creativity, and innovation has caused much of the genre to grow stagnant and dull.  People just don't get the same kind of thrills playing the same WoW or WoW-esque games decade after decade, and until a developer comes along to shake things up in some way, shape or form, people are willing to scratch that itch, even on boring and inferior products, settling for less while waiting for something better to come along.  The problem with the skinner-box of MMO's, is that it's often the compulsion to play drives people to keep grinding away, not actual fun or solid game-play. 


The large fact of the matter at hand is, the redundant WoW formula of addiction based game-play/the skinner box needs to go the way of the fuckin dinasaurs already.  A lot of people are bored with the staleness of the gameplay, the tread-mill, riding the same rides on the theme park over and over again, and very little has changed, aside this kick-starter gaming era, which is the only real hope it seems for innovation and change at this point in time, as the larger companies are there to make money first, and make a good game second, and they will not stray from their formulas...
 




 Oh yes, I was thinking of the choice to ignite the flame or become dark lord, not killing Gwynn himself.  My bad :D


Edit:  Point remains, slightly swapped around though, and equally convoluted. 




 Great point.  The economy of lag-stabs in DaS1 was some real shit, and it wasn't much better in DaS2.  Love the way they changed up viscerals in bloodborne :D 




 With how much people either spam their own quick R1's, or how quick they can load up bone marrow and take off a large chunk of your health with a bullet, the game itself pretty much renders all other attacks obsolete (to a point), aside a few precision and specific moments...  The point is, while you're trying to diversify your swings and make PvP 'interesting,' they've already nailed you with 2 R1's and taken off two thirds of your health.  Kind of annoying at how simple the combat system makes itself for PvP.


Personally, I like to throw a few R1's here or there to get things moving, then pull out the heavier and harder hitting moves once they have fapped off their R1's, and once they are expecting nothing but R1s 




 Eh, even in DaS and DaS2, the lagstabs plagued it just as badly, if not worse, so it's not too much different here, other than the 30% health penalty making it an easy 1HKO, or runes making it a 1HKO, but I've noticed a lot of people can't land parries, and if they do, they often have a hard time pulling it off in time.  Point is, I feel like it's comparable to how cheesy/annoying it could be in past games, but so it goes, par for the course. 




 Not really.  The chosen undead didn't have to face Gwyn, nor did the game really inevitably tell you that you had to, and even if you did, you still didn't understand the ins and outs and repercussions of all that.  It's pretty similar in this game... 




 Hint:  you don't have to kill him, now or later for that matter.  You can keep progressing and exploring in Old Yharnam while ignoring him  :D 




 Whatever you do, even if it takes you a month to understand and get the hang of, is, DON'T LOOK UP ANY SPOILERS OR EASY HELP OR ETC.


FROM Software makes beautiful games, and you only get one chance at a clean, mysterious, unknown playthrough of the game, where you get to discover items, bosses, and story-elements of your own.  Drink it in and enjoy it, as for me (and thousands of others), FROM games have been a challenging and invigorating innovation in what has been a fairly stagnant, and unchallenging gaming industry.  Enjoy! 




 What happened?  Did it eventually boot you out? 




 Hate gender locked classes :/

Would have loved to play a reaper, but staring at a yappy little Elinn's underwear all day is just not remotely appealing :( 




 Vella is such an awesome class, and she wound up being my favorite class to play, because she was so fun, but I hate the fact that I have to be fuckin transgender 

Lynn was fuckin bad-ass too, but the most obnoxious thing is that she literally skips around town like a retarded school girl.  Fucking dissapointing for such a wushu kung-fu touch of death bad-ass! 




 The game is fun in the beginning, a bit bland and repetitive in the middle, and fun again towards late-mid to end-game, but past 60 (more like 70), it is hard to stay competitive without cash shopping it, and last I checked, the economy had massively tanked, and if you don't have the cash to buy good end game gear, it is a long drawn out grind.  I made a good chunk of money over a period of a few years, so I was able to equip my toons well once they hit levels 60 to 70, but I can only imagine it would be frustrating as hell at present with how shitty the cash shop it is, and how ludicrous the best crafting materials cost... 




 Another comment:  have you played Tera since the last expansion from fall or christmas or whenever it was?  If so, how is it?  What are/were the major changes?  I plan on looking up more info on it here on this and the Tera subreddit, but if you or anyone else could provide some info firsthand, I'd appreciate that as well.  Thank you! 




 I loved vindictus, made a fortune on magic powders back in early 2010-teens (before economy was tanked), had great fun playin the game and leveling a bunch of toons over the years from 60-70 and then buying them the lower top tier gear, but past that, the atrocious grind that is tied into their bull-shit cash shop system absolutely ruined the game for me. The end game of pay-2-compete and not get kicked from the boat is one of the worst designs in gaming history. I'm sad as well that Nexon is such a shit company. That being said, can you explain how said one player controlled and tanked the economy? 




 Feminists are not NT, especially if you are a male. As for the rest, I mean it sounds like you have a chip on your shoulder, and I'm not talking about your rape comment... 




 Ok. Clearly you're either some insane feminist or brain-washed male apologist. Either way, you have great propensity for great bull-shit, and I'm going back to the bliss of pretending like you don't exist.  




 Honestly, I don't, and I never really did. I've even fairly good at quitting games once the compulsion to play outweighs the fun. If anything, I find leveling up characters, creating builds, and basic game progression more fun than repeating and grinding out end-game encounters, raids, or other redundant farming. I play a game, so long as I am having fun with it. Once it becomes stale or boring or a seemingly endless treadmill, I take a break or quit, as I don't have the patience or time for grinding and farming these days.

 Read my other reply.  




 Because she has to treat it nicely, as it has become sentient and domineering. But I'd be remiss if I didn't add that it totally gave me a chubby! 




 Just say no to life!  Though I suppose I would be super crazy-protective of my hands if they could net me thousands of dollars an hour for work that was something other than prostitution.  




 You make a good point, please forgive or at least excuse my more asshole-ish remarks, at least for the moment.  My apologies, as just like in person, I often come off as gruff, or sharp, and I generally try to make myself as approchable and logical and reasonable as possible.  Perhaps I have been a bit rash here, but so it goes with anything that excites me, but just as they are voicing their opinions, I am voicing mine, and none of it changes the fact that I find much of the bitching and moaning here on this post (go figure, the internet in general) to be pathetic and sad, and it often smacks of deeper seated insecurities and unresolved personal problems.  But so it goes with opinions and bias.


For myself, I can't help but feel that this whole thing is in afront to both the good and bad nature in man, and that catty bull-shit spoken behind someone's back makes us worse for our wear.  I think I am falsely perceiving it as the further emasculation of men, ie., just another attack on men, and as you said, it comes down to just more opinions:  ie., some men will say, *I can feel my feelings and that's fine,* and so it is, but if that is the case, then there is no need for said male to rag on a man who he perceives as a steroype or old-fashioned, ie., a big strong man who loves sports and seems simpler when it comes to his feelings and approaches to life.  At that point, it is like the pot calling the kettle black.


Part of why I appreciate the men in my life, is that they are diverse, strong men from various backgrounds, and most of them aren't afraid to confront me or each other if they have a problem that needs fixing, or something that needs to be resolved, and they aren't afraid to deal with their feelings, and I am talking former jail-birds, welders, mechanics (myself, a fighter/martial artist), and seeing this post, reminds me of what I hate in people period - pointless whining, the inability or fear to address one's own problems, disorganzied back-stabbing, and so forth.  I know it's no organized effort to try to drag men down, as clearly many of these people on this very forum (and outside by the sounds of their bitching) need no help in painting themselves in a poor light, but still, I find it offensive, but that is clearly my own problem, no?  I think the root of the problem is, I want men to be better than they are, and shit like this reminds me that, they, and me, and we, are often not.  We are fucking animals, and we often forget that, for all our intelligence, creativity, and virtues...


Edit:  Now I'm sad :( 




 And a lot of reports are bull-shit.  It sure is fuck aint 1 in 4 women have been raped... 




 You're so enlightened and smurt.  when I growed up, I want to be like you c: 




 And apparently the joke is on you, as there seems to be no pleasing you.  I like it that, even if I write something like, *"real men learn to deal with their feelings,"* you still choose to take offence to it, even though that is exactly what you were talking about, as if learning to feel and cope with your emotions somehow makes you less of a man.  Over-sensitive much?  It's ok, I'm sensative too, and I can admit it, and I am also a practitioner of martial arts, and can fight with the best of them, and I have and will continue to kick some ass.  Point is, I can do perceived manly shit, and I can also deal with my feelings and admit to my faults, and address my feelings as they come up.  I'm also letting you know that just because there is that old joke/stigma/judgment scale, doesn't mean that all modern men adhere to it, or are too afraid to talk about it.  I know many awesome men who are as manly as they come.  Welders, mechanics, prison-birds, all manners of men from all walks of life who aren't afraid to admit when they are in pain, when they have a problem, and when they need help.  I'd suggest you find some people you can connect with, and maybe they can help you come to terms with your own issues. 




 Eh, it's alright.  Did I get the job? 




 You write it like it is something every other man does, or something men do casually, when the reality is, it is a very small percentage of men who actually perpetrate that crime.  The last few studies I read put it something at like, 4 or 5% of men are actually that violent/controlling/fucked in the head.  That whole 25% of women (1 in 4) have been raped is a bull-shit statistic, completed at a bull-shit college in a bull-shit study.  Regret, shame, guilt, and anger for your actions and choices does not constitute rape.  That being said, while it is a small amount of women who falsely acuse men of abuse and rape, if women could stop doing that, that would be great. 




 Right, and so long as it's somewhat fun, what else are you going to do anyhow? 




 Don't feed the troll. 




 bahahahaha.  I enjoyed this post.  Thank you :) 




 Everyone has them.  The difference is, I've worked my ass off to deal with mine, and hopping on someone's asinine reddit post to vent your issues, while popular, really doesn't do anything to benefit anyone, namely the original whiny poster.  And why am I doing this?  Because I choose to, because it is amusing, and because maybe one of these whiners will pull the plug and let out enough of their own insecure, dellusional bull-shit to think, "jeeze, maybe other men are not the problem." 




 Chodehats are stylish as fuck though! 




 Real men learn to deal with their feelings, whatever that entails for the individual - and don't fool yourself.  Men talk about it all the time.


That being said, coming on here to vent insecurities and jealousies is kind of pathetic dude, and frankly, I find this post and most of the people in it really fucking sad. 




 I know right?  You might not like them all, understand them all, or want to be friends with them all, as you can have vastly different interests, approaches, and philosophies on life, but it's not like we need to make a pathetic thread about this to stab our fellow men in the back like a bunch of catty hens who are low on the pecking order, right?


This shit is pathetic. 




 Being fake or posturing or lieing isn't unique to men or rednecks.  In fact, women lie every day about how tall they are, what their face looks like, their hair, etc...


Also, the real country people I know have earned my respect above anyone else, as they are very knowledgeable about survival, construction, creativity, and all manners of useful things.  And while they may not be the most cultured people, they are a lot more useful than the vast suburbs full of clueless, middle to upper class children who know little to nothing about life, or providing for themselves and their family. 




 Dude, no shit huh?  I've made several posts on here to combat the influx of bitching and whining by what sounds like a bunch of immature high-school children having identity crises, coming on here, venting their own insecurities and emotional issues, but still, the ceaseless discharge of bull-shit is still flowing!  Frankly, it's pathetic. 




 Women rape men too.  And the amount of men who rape women is a very teeny-tiny percent of men overall.... 




 Thank you, 'IEatAnyAss.'  I'm sure your suggestions have been well received. 




 You make it sound like immaturity is unique to men and men alone... 




 I've made several replies along these lines to combat the influx of whiny children and pandering little bitches who come in here to vent their insecurities, and holy hell, you can't imagine the amount of butt-hurt and inferiority complexes! I get it though. I can tell a lot of them are young men and women with little sense of self-identity and few honest personal beliefs, young liberals who are hopping on the band-wagon of 'combatting the stereotypes of being a man,' thinking their is some pay-off or benefit to anyone for it, but little do they know, they give themselves away as jealous, insecure, spiteful children. They are airing their issues on here, simply because they don't know any better.


These kids need to work through their emotional issues and neuroses, as there is nothing more pathetic and obnoxious than an adult child...

 Way to kill the joke.... and it still holds true in some cases... a perfect excuse for stupid people :D 




 I made a simple comment that this whiny, passive-aggressive, cheap-shot bull-shit makes the 'men' and 'women' of this thread look like a bunch of angsty, insecure, high-school children, that's all.


Take it or leave it, be a passive-aggressive bitch about it, whine about it, do what you will, but I stand by what I said.  This post, like much of reddit/the internet, is a cancerous circle-jerk for weak-minded people.  And if you simper enough, maybe it will get you some attention, and maybe it'll even get you laid! 




 And oh how they defend their pathetic whining and passive-aggressive bull-shit! 




 I hate the men in this thread:  you are making men sound like pathetic, catty high-school children. 




 Yeah!  How dare they be men! 




 LOL 




 I don't hate anything in particular about men, but I do hate people that feel the need to give credence to this post in a pathetic, passive-aggressive, dear-diary entry because they are too chicken-shit to deal with their own emotional problems and inferiority complexes.


It's not any man's fault per se that you feel the way you do, but please, learn how to deal with your own feelings, and take responsibility for your own goddamn life.  Most of this just sounds like childish bitching, and hens scratching each other's face off for a higher rank in the pecking order.  It's goddamn disgusting. 
























 Yeah, in your case, you might be better off farming wolves in the orphinarium or whatever the hell the place is called (as the wolves have a higher drop rate than gargoyles) just to get the last few chunks you need to get your BB to +9.  You can probably obtain the chunks you need for that last upgrade in 30-60 minutes. 




 You don't belong here dude.  You need to be way more reactionary, cynical, and unnecessarily aggressive over the most inane shit, then defend your angry, insecure delusions till the bitter end.


Yep.  I turn 30 soon myself, and while I do get in and enjoy an occasional binge, my time isn't free, and it's definitely worth more than what it once was, and I'd prefer not to have to spend it mindlessly killing werewolves over and over so I can get this one last chunk to finish this upgrade so I can play competitively with a new weapon... but, ya know, fuckin casuls.


Let's have a bloodborne playdate sometime, and while we're busy with the important shit, maybe the old ladies can talk about shoes? 




 One useless line of text, and neither have you, or any number of the other numerous complaints in this post. 




 Hahaha.  Funy that you mention that.  I had actually taken that exact same screen shot awhile back when I accidentally found that angle.  Purely horrifying! 




 Shaman bone blade the maiden and laugh with glee as she gets raped by spiders wielding spiders as weapons! 




 Troll is troll? 




 I appreciate your sensibilities, and the fact that you didn't decry the changes as the end of the world.


The game is already limited in builds, PvP, diverity, replayability (since it is fairly short is easy), and opening it up a bit to reward players where it's due (chunks from bosses, etc), and to allow people to have fun with each other is just fine with me.  Plenty of people don't co-op at all, and just because it is available, it doesn't mean every new or inexperienced player is going to call in a level 200 toon to beat the cleric beast for them... 




 This game is already short and easy, and the PvP is severely limited and very samey due to a lack of builds, armor (that is more than fashion) and weapons (which brings creativity and more diversity).


A few changes to open the game up a bit isn't the end of the world.  Blood chunks were stupid anyhow - unless someone out there really enjoys mindlessly farming the same static mobs in the same location over and over?  At least we can see some more diversity as we hunt for them.  Having too few chunks available only limited the game more than it needed to be and already is (and weapons you could play with competitively on one of the four to five available builds). There is no reason that they shouldn't drop as rewards from bosses and be available at a high price.  Whether it was for the same reasons or not, FROM apparently agreed.


As for co-op, well, not everyone co-ops, and not everyone seeks to have a high level come in and kill their bosses for them.  The game has been out for a few months now, and plenty of people have already made plenty of progress or beaten the game, and if players don't really know anyone to set a password with, they are out of luck there anyhow.  It's not like you can give newbies +10 weapons and blood rocks, and just because they made a wide range of co-op possible, it doesn't mean everyone will be rushing to have a level 100-300 beat the Cleric Beast for them.


As for the PvP, well, it's already very limited, and most fights feel fairly same-ish, as we only have four or five builds to really choose from.  Invasions were already put on the back-burner in this game via the mechanics FROM chose and intentionally put in the game:  clearly they wanted red invaders to be at a disadvantage (unlike every souls game in the past), and they wanted to give them a real challenge, at least, more so than griefing PvE players.  The crux of the problem here is they gave us no better alternatives a la covenants that are worth a damn, arenas, and in general, more PvP and multiplayer options.  This was a real step backwards imo, and aside the general lack of diversity and builds in the game, this is the biggest thing limiting the game at present, and as other people said, aside some major over-hauls, I don't see how they can fix it. 




 Both you and Hydrall make some great points.  Whoever downvoted you had no good reason to do so, especially since you said what you said so matter of factly and friendly.


BB's covenants are shallow and lacking, the PvE is very well designed, but also very short, it needs more multi-player features, and in general, between the lack of armor (and armor actually having function as much as fashion) and weapons, and thus creativity and variety, I really do believe that BB will have a much short shelf-life.  


I put BB down for a bit and started playing SOFS a few weeks ago myself (along with vanilla to play with my brother), whereas, when DaS1 and DaS2, I couldn't put those down or play another game for a minimum of four to six months, and even then, I'd always come back for more PvE, PvP, and to try some new builds and ideas, like I couldn't get enough, compared to BB, where I have already made all the builds available, beaten the game+chalices with each toon, PvPd with them, and already sort of been sated, as it all feels so samey.

BB is a master-piece to be sure, and the story is cool as shit, and the mechanics are tight, it's just not the best game FROM has made, specifically when it comes to multi-player :/  




 And I agree with you there, though it makes co-op more player friendly in general.  If someone were to ask me to help, I'd just use an un-upgraded weapon to level the field :D 




 Wow.  So much cynacism and gloom and doom here.  Just because you hold an opinion about the reasons behind the game changes, or anything else, keep in mind that IT IS possible that FROM made these changes for reasons other than what you assume.


I keep seeing comments like:


*"This is the end of the series,"* but BB was already a short and easy game in the first place (easier than any of the past games).  And it definitely needs some tweaks to have more longevity.


*"The PvP is now ruined and totally unfair,"* As if us red invaders and our PvP builds and practice were ever fair to us griefing what usually winds up as PvE hosts in the first place?  Didn't FROM already make it clear that they didn't want red invaders to have it easy at all in this game by way of the game mechanics themselves?  And didn't FROM make it clear that they didn't want invasions (host griefing, usually favoring the PvP build invader) to be the focus?  The biggest problem here in lou of the former, is that they gave us no better alternative, and what they are missing is a non-penalized PvP option such as unique bells, arenas, more useful covenants, as well as some sort of PvP option without the health nerf.


*"FROM is caturing to teh casuls."*  Maybe.  Or maybe they thought they made some bad decisions in the first place?  Maybe blood chunk farming is a boring and redundant time-sink and shitty design, and they realized that chunks could be as good a reward as anything else in a chalice dungeon?  Maybe they never intended for certain things to work out certain ways in the first place, and they are now fixing what they see as problems and mistakes.  It doesn't mean "the casuls won the day."


The point is, this game has its problems, but they existed long before any of these patches, and just because FROM makes a decision to change something in their game that they have a right to, it doesn't mean that the elite circle-jerk has lost and the casuls win.  IMO, the game's lognevity is already severely limited by many factors, and it will take more than a few minor changes to give it the oompf it needs to really stand up as a good and long-lasting multi-player FROM game. 




 If you want to PvP (and mostly fairly), there are plenty of options in this game, and there is no reason for you to not find it.  If you were looking for invasions though, ie., the easy griefing of hosts, it seems like FROM already made it clear through their game design that they didn't want that to be the focus of PvP in this game (or much decent PvP in general, for that matter).


To me, it seems like FROM made it clear that they didn't want this game to be as much about griefing players with red invaders as the previous titles, hence bell-maidens only spawn statically in a few locations, when you invade you get a health nerf, and if you invade other places that don't have bell-maidens, then you will most likely be fighting a 2 v. 1 battle along with your health nerf.  


To me it just seemed like FROM's way of saying, "fuck you red invaders - have a real challenge." 




 This game is great and all, but it was easy and short in the first place - and now they added a mechanic so friends can co-op easier with their friends and multi-player in this game has been pretty clunky and shitty most of the time (though the previous patch helped a bit), more than anything else in FROM's series, even more obnoxious than SM at times.  If anything, these options are even more important for a game like BB that is already lacking in variety and replayability.  I don't understand why you are so cynical about all this, and why everything they have done is somehow catering to casuls.  


How about a different side of your personal mind-set and opinion, that maybe FROM thought they made a mistake by making blood chunks a boring grind or redundant by burning through NG cycles to aquire?  Maybe they wanted people with friends to be able to play with their other friends?  Maybe they regretted some of their decisions and ideas?  Maybe they want to keep changing the game to make it better in their eyes? 




 Whoa.  Why so cynical? 




 I thought PvP happened regardless of preset passwords, and even though people have gone back and forth to figure the level ranges out, I thought it was sitll determined by some sort of +/- level range factor?


Edit:  or is this something about the covenant mechanics? 




 Best way is to probably post/offer your services here and on the hunter's bell, that way people can summon you with an agreed upon password :D 




 Hmmm, in the OP IW said he checked for chunks after killing the cleric beast in NG+, but nothing was available.  


Someone else just said "blood chunks are available to buy after defeating One Reborn. Just tested this on NG+ " 




 Yeah.  I had a pwmf22gu open last night to which I had already killed the first boss.  I cleared the second boss, but I don't think I got anything other than a blood gem, BUT, I did clear the pthumerian elder on the 3rd layer and he dropped 2 chunks along with a blood gem. 




 There is a messenger bath vendor (just like the blood echo shop) right outside the hunter's cabin, through the side door in between the stairway entrance, and the entrance that loops around next to all the chalice gravestones. 




 You call me hypocritical?  Because this is pretty funny at this point:  For not reading my replies, you sure are angry about them.  Keep it up, cuz at this rate, along with the #1 businessman sticker or whatever trophy you received, at this rate you'll get the "Internet Asshole of the Day Award."  You just have to keep acting like a totally irrational, dishonest, disingenuous dick-head that refuses to listen to logic or reason or provide a cogent response.  Go on, I'll say it for you:  *la la la, I can't hear you, I'm not listening, la la la* 




 No, that's not necessarily what I meant or what I meant to imply, but as far as game design goes, you do bring up interesting points, and I am always happy to hear when developers or players come up with new and unconventional or non-traditional ideas when it comes to 'upgrades' or character's powers and progression (scaling, horizontal progression, etc.), but I digress. Inconvenience might have not been the best word on my behalf, as I am all for working and earning rewards in any game.  Adding chunks to the chalice dungeon is brilliant in that regard, as I'd rather upgrades/items/rewards/etc in any game come from a hard and challenging encounter, rather than having to say, repeat the same action over and over again (ie, killing werewolves for chunks, as it is very basic and redundant).  Sure, chalice boss dungeons and chalices in general can be a bit redundant and mindless as well, but it still remains more rewarding than the former imo, as there is more adventure there, especially making uncharted and new dungeons.


As for purchasing chunks, well they helped compensate for that by making chunks so expensive, also, I'm not sure at what point they even become available in the game cycle, but it is surely fairly mid to late game, and again, it's not like they are cheap.  So even if you had all but beaten a new game cycle with a new character, taking into account other gear and insight items/armor you'd want to buy, at most you could only buy 4-10 chunks in one play-through, which isn't much, but it would depend on how you acquired and spent your insight, whether you did the chalices immediately or after the main game, and some other factors in there. 




 Cool.  Thanks for the info, and thanks for making and updating this post :D


Edit:  On a related note - do we know what triggers the insight vendors to start selling chunks? 




 So...having to beat the game multiple times on new-game plus cycles to experiment and play with new and different upgraded weapons, (one of the few and limited things that really brings some much needed variety in this game, especially on competitive levels and so forth) was some sort of great design idea to you?  Not only is it fairly redundant, but I like to believe that FROM realized they made a mistake there by making chunks so few and far in between.  I'm glad they at least made blood chunks expensive to be on par with their rarity, and I'm fine with blood rocks being so rare, but honestly, farming is busy work, and it is a lazy approach to game design in any game imo, and I like to think that game developers can find more creative and enjoyable methods for players to experience their games, methods that don't involve time-sink busy work.


To further expand on it, once you learn Bloodborne (it isn't hard, as it is a very short game), it isn't hard to make new characters, or continue on older ones, to beat the game all over again and farm all the chunks on each playthrough.  You can even obtain all static chunks in less than an hour, but the point remains that I think it was an over-sight to begin with, or at the least, I think FROM didn't realize it would be seen and experienced as such a bother or restriction in the first place, and at the very least, I'd like to believe that FROM realized there was no real *need* for this hindrance.  


The question is, what real value did it add to the game, other than an oddly imposed inconvenience?  Especially if you have multiple toons as many of us do - multiple toons who we ran through all the chalices with and optimized and so forth and already spent a lot of time farming chunks and gems with.  I bring this up for those of us who are and who were willing to put the time in to aquire the gear and upgrades, yet still thought the lack of chunks was a bad design choice, to offset the attempt to justify this argument as some sort of hardcore elite gamer vs. casul opinion.


 




 Wow.  How do you go about internet cynicism, specifically, reddit-grade-ass-hole cynicism so eloquently, politely, and concisely?  I need to work on that... 




 Yeah, I saw a few other posts here mentioning getting chunks and gems at the same time, which I think is pretty cool, but to be more specific than my initial post, I am just hoping they kept the original and systematic approach of radial gems from pthumeru, waning from Isz, etc, as it helps stream-line the farming process, and adds some method to it.  I don't really care much for farming anything in any game really, but it's nice to know where to go if players are looking for something in particular. 




 I was wondering the same thing.  If gem drops are now completely random, then it seems that this will be an annoyance since you will have to randomly farm randomness for completely random drops, rather than at least narrowing it down by farming specific chalice type bosses... 




 Looks like the insight bath vendor messengers show up even if you don't have 10 insight :D

Finally, that was a fairly stupid mechanic/idea. 




 Just checked this!  Awesome.  Finally, there is more of a use for insight!  Now we just need a better use for blood echoes :D 




 People down-voted your posts because you are being a total asshole about all this.  I said OP made a dick-move, and explained why I came to that opinion, and right away, you attack me with all manner of inane and irrelevant shit you pulled out of your asshole;  from claiming that I am a newbro, to calling me a vaati fanboi, ad nauseum.  Apparently OP believes he made a mistake too in some way, shape, or form, as he deleted his post.  What's that tell you?


And then you have the ovaries to throw the word straw-man at me?  You never once addressed what I said (aside adding in a few assumptions), and you instead attack me?  Fuck off with your stuck-up horse-shit that no one cares about and your irrelevant bull-shit.  If you act like an aggressive, socially inept basement dweller, surprise surprise when people assume you are just that.  


And not that your petty "newbro" bullshit matters, but yes, you are wrong.  I've been playing the souls series for many years now, and again with your asinine assumptions, what does that have to do with OP's original claim and my dissenting opinion?  Go find a post that OP hasn't deleted yet and jerk off to that you fucking jerk-off of an asshole. 




 Haha.  Well done. 




 Haha.  Just realized your comments were downvoted to hell.  That's what the community thinks of you, apparently. 




 Now who is being a dickhead?  And this is pretty funny, considering you're the one had the nerve to bring up the "community" to me.  Is this how you usually treat people in your community?  Because this immature, *I don't wanna hear it la-la-la I'm not listening* childish bull-shit is pretty goddamn immature and toxic.


Yes, isn't this community so nice - all the toxic assholes like you can get together and act the self-righteous and self-important, dicks for no reason at all, because, well, I guess you are just entitled to that.

So what are you, 14 years old?  La-la-la you're not listening?  Gonna go bitch and sulk with the other toxic assholes in this community?  And as soon as someone brings up something that you disagree with, you tell them they are fanboys and to fuck off, with no mature or cogent argument?  Yeah.  That's what i thought, and that's what I get for expecting more from socially inept troll's in their mother's basements...  




 Fair enough.  




 You might be right about half that.  The problem is, even if we put 99 in health, we can still get chumped the fuck out by 27% gems in Ludwig's and chikage in a few hits.  I don't think they thought all this out well enough to be honest :/


So, do you still have a link or name for whoever you were talking about saying that 150 was a good meta?  I mean, I still think it's a bit high, as you can be super versatile and have a lot of survivability, but like you said, PvP is fairly limited and all :/ 




 Wow. You must be one of the community founders, since you are bold enough to speak for it, and bold enough to assume to know what the hell I really think about all this. Of course credit should be given where credit is due, but some vague accusation doesn't constitute proof, proof which I have yet to see, because as it goes with a lot of people, there is a lot of conjecture in between what is given in the game, so go figure that a lot of people wind up with similar conclusions. As for your comment about IN4 Das2, I have no clue what you're talking about. The game was a great RPG, it just wasnt a great souls game, but that didnt make it any less fun. Miyazaki still directed it with B team doing the rest, but hey, yeah, fuck it. It's not a souls game because you said so, and you made it clear that you speak for the community, being an all pretentious, presumptuous and self-important prick about it. 


Edit:  To be clear of why I think what OP did is a dick-move (and I said dick-move, not that OP is in fact a total dick), is, he should have confronted Vaati about it first and foremost in private, rather than throwing open the soap-opera door.  Instead of screaming "I'm 99% sure Vaati ripped me off" right off the gate, he could have talked to him in private, or at least attempted to, and then made a decision from there.  As OP said, Vaati denied it, and if we take his word for it, than that means all of OP's accusations are for nothing.  Just think of this:  if your wife or girlfriend thought you were cheating on her, wouldn't you rather her confront you in private, and be emotionally mature human beings about it, or would you rather her kick in the door of yours and her's family reunion, screaming that she thinks you cheated on her?  Do you see where I am going with this?  OP acted the melodramatic house-wife who did the former, and the husband said, "no, I did not cheat on you," so now apparently the whole scene was made for what?  Attention?  Jealousy?  The demand for recognition?  I'll let you decide... 




 I do agree in giving credit where credit is due, but what I'm saying is, plenty of us posted and continue to post our lore theories and ideas (most of us without monetizing it) and I'm sure OP wound up at the same conclusions as a lot of us, with the rest being filled in by conjecture and what little room there is for originality and speculation.  I've been discussing the lore since release with others just like the OP, and there is a give and take and we definitely influence each other's ideas by said discussion, and plenty of us have wound up at similar conclusions or pointed out where we thought we were wrong or right, all without claiming pledgerism, but I get it. Vaati is an easy target, and OP got the attention and recognition he wanted, with little regard to any truth in the matter.  I still have yet to see any proof that OP was pladgerised, other than vagueries and the other givens that go hand in hand with discussion of a FROM game.  




 This has nothing to do with being a 'fanboi' as you so eloquently put it, rather that OP went about this like an asshole.  I would have said the same thing if he made claims against Terra, ENB, Davecontrol, silvermont, or anyone else.


Vaati is just one of many people who make decent videos about FROM's game lore.  Sure, he wasn't the first, but just because ENB did it 'first,' doesn't mean Vaati should be derided for it.  Shit happens all the time in any field, in any subject, on anything.  Vaati isn't even my favorite, but he does produce his videos to a higher quality than most, so I'll give him that.   




 Well said, especially because I have seen no other proof of actual plagiarism, other than the common references to in-game items and etc that are used by a lot of people.  Go figure that a linear game with a few pieces of cryptic lore start to sound the same and leave the same conclusions after awhile :/ 




 I just read your update.  You think Vaati unconsciously or consciously borrowed from your works?  I'm sure after days and weeks of reading reddit posts about the same game, the same items, and a lot of the same conclusions, you would never do the same thing to anyone else either, huh?


I don't buy it.


Edit:  Last thing I have to post here (I should have just done one long, thorough post, sorry for that), is that I find it funny that you say, "please don't make any knee-jerk reactions," which is pretty damn hypocritical, since it is exactly what your bold claim with little no no evidence here is.  Way to be a dick about all this. 




 This was a dick-move.  I agree with a lot of other posters here that you went about this like a brat.  You should have contacted Vaati personally, first and foremost, rather than post this for attention and recognition.  If Vaati didn't contact you, you could have warned him you would do this, and then mentioned that you already tried to contact him for a reasonable amount of time in your original post.  


This is a passive-aggressive, drama-inducing shit-fiesta.  What did you think was going to happen?  I think a lot of people are just sour on Vaati because he makes decent money doing what he does, and people say he is a band-wagoner, yet they couldn't do what he does, nor do they attempt to do so, but still they remain jealous, or they think that the original lore posters on FROM games in the souls series somehow hold a copyright on speculating and theory-crafting about the games/books/whatever that they love, as if they were the first ever to do so on a video game or movie or book or any other medium.  I get it that the souls series is unique, and thus, this seems more unique, but it's not new to the art world....

 




 Yeah - but it can infect you without even being hit by him, and drain your health super-quick, and if you're busy dodging, you can't even use an antidote in time.


The one-shot grab is a given, as it can kill a lot of higher levels in one-shot if there health is already low and they are already poisoned :D 




 Yeah - or we could stop using 27% damage gems on weapons :D


Some of the weapons are easy to make OP with minimal investment.  A LHB without 27% damage gems is still a powerhouse, and you can get it there before you even beat the game.


Edit:  But again - it's not a matter of it being like dark souls or not.  It's the same fact of the matter that there is little to no sacrifice or focus in your build once you really start pumping levels.  This is the same argument it has always been... 




 Aside loose structure points, general FROM lore interpretation of citing items and in-game descriptions that everyone does, and the Lovecraft quotation, the only other thing I've seen anyone on here mention as proof for OP's drama-inspiring claim is the "mensis school being ripped into the nightmare" idea, which to me was a natural conclusion. My point is - neither of your phrasing was original or what I would say is plagiarized, as such imagery fits naturally into such a violent and weird game. 


I bring this up, because I never read OP's thesis, but I have seen vaati's vidya, and before I read of any of this, the imagery I had in my head is one of the school ' ripped into the nightmare'. That is the natural picture I saw in my head and the exact word I thought of for it too - in some sort of poltergeist (when the house was sucked and ripped into another dimension) or crazy ritualistic fashion. If anything, a lot of the lore and speculation sounds similar, especially on the parts that are easier to agree on or figure out, and so far I see this as coincidental, especially because no one has given any actual example of plagiarism other than 'they sound similar at points.'  Go figure. A lot of us have been posting lore theories since day 1, and a lot of people and ideas posted before and after us sound similar or even the same. 


My question would be, for all the people who post long-winded videos and essays, how much of 'your' work has been influenced by other's ideas?  I'm sure there are plenty of ideas that were borrowed without being cited, even if it was an 'original' thought. 


Edit:  clarity n grammar 




 Poison becomes a bigger danger, specifically for the AIDS from the blood starved beast.  For dicks like him you can use blood cocktails to distract them, and things like oil urns and molotovs are helpful too.


As other posters have said, you can run past most enemies, which is a good idea provided you are stocked up on supplies.


Most of the bosses are actually quite easy in BB compared to DaS1 and 2 onebroing (agility sucks!), you just have to follow the mechanics and be patient.


Good luck.
 




 I do appreciate that Bloodborne is one of the few Cthulu/Lovecraft mythos related games with an actual Lovecraftian mechanic (insight vs. insanity/frenzy) in it, I just wish they would have made it a bit deeper and more useful :/ 




 There is actually fur growing out of them, it just hasn't poked through their layers of muscles and fat yet... ? 




 150 is really high though.  At that level, you don't really have to make much of a focused choice or sacrafice, as you pretty much have enough points to max (40-50) health, endurance, and two primary combat stats.... ie, arcane and dex, STR and Dex, Dex and BT etc.


Edit:  Aside my original toon who I just kept leveling due to having too many souls, my main toons/pvp'ers are all at level 98-110 though :) 




 I know I'm late to the party, and I agree with some of your points, but I think you overlooked the real reason and the most important reason that the chikage is even worth mentioning or using, is that it is based around a Bloodtinge build - one of all of four to five different build types available in the game.  Seriously, in terms of build and challenge options, this game is very lacking, and with how different the playstyle is on a Bloodtinge build is, it becomes important that we have chikage as a weapon and an option.


Aside the unique nature of the Chikage, the Bloodtinge build is the only build that can really utilize ranged weapons (namely Eve and repeating pistol) for consistant and decent damage, and no, I'm not counting the cannon with it's former 10 and now 12 bullet requirement, as you can get far more damage out of Eve with those same 10-12 bullets, and we won't even get into bone marrow ash.  Again - it opens up a different play-style, and to utilize it to its fullest (as with any build really), you have to do more than just spam R1, and it can involve a lot more micro-management, which can be fun.


The point is, as others have said, the Chikage with an appropriate BT build is a very different and fun playstyle compared to how similar the other builds can play, and this is important in a game with very few build options.  And for the record, my first toon was a STR build that was really fun to play, who settled with the versatility of the hunter's axe, as it was strong, and the movesets were great for crowd control and general damage.  I tried using the Kirkhammer, but between all the narrow hallways, wonky cameras on big bosses, and etc., I couldn't stand how the kirkhammer often took up most of my screen, and made it impossible to tell what was going on.  I wanted to like the wheel, but I just couldn't stand how slow it was and how short the reach is, even if it could be powered up and hit multiple times and etc.  My second build and one of my favorites was pure dex with the BoM/rifle spear/saw cleaver and finally BB as my primary weapon.  I love the burial blade moveset, but I hate that you have to pretty much beat the game, and then farm deep into chalices to really max it out with appropriate gems, compared to how early you can get Ludwig's Holy Blade, and how easy it is to get high damage on the axe or hammer or Ludwig's.  But my favorite build to date is a 25STR/50SKL quality type build who uses the OP Ludwig's for the hell of it sometimes when I want to roflstomp PvE/PvP, but primarily uses BB because it's pretty much my favorite weapon, and sometimes the BoM are fun too, because it is the only option we have for dual wielding blades in each hand.  (Worth noting, I didn't PvP much with my STR builds compared to how much I PvPd on my BT and dex builds, especially my dex builds.  Those are fun!)


It's not just the hype or over-ratedness of the weapon, it is just the simple fact that we only have four different builds available in this game (five, if you count quality).  Thanks for reading this :D 




 And people wonder why the term "slut" is a perjorative.  Dumb bitch asks him to fuck her, then fuck her in the ass, then give her a rusty trombone - then he complies, and she claims rape, after she already bragged about fucking all of her ex's friends and getting an STD... see where I am going with this?  It's also a matter of how it affects the woman's psyche, vs the lack of an effect on a man's psyche.  Very few women can be successful sluts, plus, being a stud takes some serious status or charm, but I digress.


The point is, the dude should probably raise his standards, even for a fuck-piece, and I hope this bitch gets what's coming to her... 




 These are all good points too.  I helped my brother get into DaS and DaS2 by co-oping a lot with him in his early to mid play-throughs, and before long, he was beating bosses and eventually the game itself, by himself, or with other summons.


Edit:  Keep in mind, you could always let your friend summon you, and you could use an un-upgraded weapon, and slowly chip away at the beast without killing the boss for him. 




 Eh, if he couldn't beat the asylum demon and never went back, I wonder about his longevity in this game as well, though I know for a lot of people, once they learn the mechanics and get over the initial difficulty hump, they get significantly better, and eventually these games become pretty easy.  However, if your friend in general lacks patience and intelligence, then I wouldn't count on that.


That being said, the cleric beast is pretty close to asylum demon in that he looks large and menacing, but he is a push-over - super-slow and stupid so as to be an appropriate first souls-type boss of the game.

He can focus on using oil urns and molotov cock-tails, or shooting the cleric beast in the head to trigger viscerals.  Other than that, your friend has to learn to dodge the heavily telegraphed swings and slams, and he has to learn to be patient, because that is the epitome of FROM's games.  You will be punished for being impatient and sloppy. 




 Yeah - if there was at least a bit more diversity in the layouts, the tilesets, the enemies, and even the bosses, I might have been more excited to grind them out on a few different characters, but they are pretty goddamn boring now after three toons, and soon a fourth on the way once I am done playing DaS2 (again).  I usually put a movie on my other monitor :D 




 With the limitations of builds, weapons and items in the game, the best you can do imo (aside low level runs or new toons) is limiting yourself in what weapon you use, or at least changing it up (I never used Ludwig's till my third or 4th build, and my gawd, that thing is a killer).  I do appreciate that playing the game through with different builds using different weapons does feel like a significantly different experience, but that seems to be about it.  


You could try something more odd like the wheel or stakedriver since you have a lot of STR, and couple it with the cannon, or you could try the quality-type cleavers, but other than that, don't expect much of a change in NG+.  


If anything, I'd suggest making an all around different build.  Go either dex or arcane or BT (which is actually quite fun for PvE). 




 WarSouls 40K Space Duneborne?  I love that game!  Would play it for sure! 




 Haha.  I remember reading that article over a year ago, and in the comments I left something to the effect of:


"I thought this was going to be a game review, not your goddamn personal existential crisis?  Go outside and play and get some sunshine dude." 




 ME's ending sucked big balls in major ways.  No idea what those assholes were thinking, as the ending went against everything that made the series great - the characters, the plot, the stories, the everything... so stupid  




 That patch is taking you hours to download?  Stay away from PvP please!  :P 




 That?  That was added, uh, to make the game truly terrifyinh?

*You'll go hollow...*

*shudders* 




 Sudoku* 




 Well, the community was split with SOFS' release, but I have seen plenty of signs and co-op action when I chose for SOFS.  I also went back to vanilla DaS2 to play with my brother, and I joined him in his play through on one of my old 800k SM builds.  We're now closer to 9million SM, and we've seen a lot of action in both invasions and co-op for the majority of our play through, so other than people not needing or wanting co-op, or maybe one of those odd SM brackets, I can't say I've had the same experience.  Even at such a higher SM now, I still see tons of summon signs in the usual places (Iron Keep, DLC bosses, King's gate, all the newb areas back at low SM, etc.).


It's probably your SM, your play time, or the community on the xbox. (I'm on PC). 




 Loved dual wielding maces and craftsman hammers, though the range sucks, and they are kinda suck for PvP, but they can wreck if you learn to utilize them for catching rolls and that forward step of the L2 powerstance.


That being said, I love dual wielding the black knight greatsword and majestic greatsword on my powerstance pyro build.


And honestly, pretty much every other weapon as well.  I love the heide knight swords, the sun swords, the shadow daggers, regular longswords, you name it! 




 I agree on soul memory.  Bad mechanic, to a point, but a lot of FROM fans like making multiple characters anyhow, and so that went on anyhow, or you could just back up and restore your toons.  The agape ring wasn't the best solution, but it would have been much better if they put it in the game off the bat.  I am going to be the first person ever to defend SM here for a moment, or at least say that I can see why they chose SM as a mechanic, as this game made it far easier to level higher than 100-150 metas, on top of having more stats and no useless stats, and what you got is a vast amount of options when it came to your builds.  It isn't as simple as comparing it to DaS1, as DaS2 added too many new stats and build options, which was pretty awesome.  To defend SM further I'd say, at least gave us lots of options with the different covenants and summon signs (loved the usefulness of the small sign), as well as the name engraved ring, which made most of the SM problems that interfere with co-op non-existent for me, at least.  Overall, SM has been and continues to be less of a problem to me than how shitty multi-player was in BB for the first month and a half of it being out.  Now it has been patched a bit, and I am already sated with the PvE, and bored with the lack of variety in PvP.  


Sure, you don't necessarily need a bunch of similar yet different skin weapons, but you can't say it doesn't matter, as fashion-shouls has engrossed people in these games since day one, and has done a lot to increase the shelf-life of FROM titles more than most people will admit.  As for BB, well, you have like, one OP-primary weapon for each of the four (maybe 5) build types, and a few lesser weapons to compliment that, which frankly, is shit for options.  Sure the design is great, but at this point I'd love some more clutter.  Please, give me some more weapons to test and play with and PvP with.  I'll agree, the clutter can be annoying, but over the years, I've tried a lot of those options, and found enough nuances and changes to say that a lot of it is warranted, especially when they have unique looks, reaches, and movesets (this being most important).  As much as I love the design of the weapons and armor in BB, less isn't more here.  More would have been better, even if every weapon wasn't as cool as the burial blade.


I definately agree on the lag being a consistent turn-off in FROM games, but that hasn't stopped me, and others (who PvP far more ravenously and frequently than me) from enjoying these games well past their base PvE games, and well past their primes (and what would have been any equivelant game's prime).  The problem is, there really isn't much of an alternative for these games out on the market.  Sure, there have been a few indie clone-likes and soul-esque influences popping up here and there, but in terms of fluid yet weighty combat, coupled with real risk-and-reward game-play and loss (and we won't even get into FROM's unique story-telling), the market is mostly flat and stagnant when it comes to challenging the player's mind as well as their skills in the unique way that FROM does.   




 Black Knight weapons are fire weapons in this game, so it would be best used with flame weapon as opposed to sunlight blade.  You'd be able to get much more AR out of it that way, since the weapon buff spells increase AR by a flat amount, plus a percentage of the elemental damage.  I'd suggest something with lightning inherently in it, such as the heide weapons, or find what other weapons get awesome damage with lightning infusions. 




 You're all the result of a bunch of retarded monkeys who had butt-sex with a fish-frog.  There!  Are you happy?! 




 Really?  A lot of FROM fans have posted quite a bit about it, how they are already back to playing Dark Souls 2 (myself included), especially when it comes to PvP.  I'll definitely be back to playing BB soon, but after making a few different PvP builds and taking them through the game (chalices included), and using them a bit for multiplayer, I already feel sated, whereas, with DaS1 and 2, I couldn't put them down for months on end, and here, a lot of us fans are already bored or sated with BB after a month and a half.  


I mean, the lack of weapons and armor that creates a lack of creativity and build variety, on top of shallow, pointless covenants really kills the replayability of the game imo.  I am just one of many to think and say that, and that's not even getting into the clunky-ass multiplayer system, the lame-ass limited invasion bell-maiden system, or the long loading screens.  I know the patches have helped a bit, but there is no way to make up for the fact that there are so few builds and challenge options, especially compared to DaS2.  Sure, a large group of people flock to the metas in these games anyhow, but I saw some crazy creative and fun builds and cosplays in DaS2, and continue to see more, whereas for BB, there are only a few weapons in the first palce (let alone versatile and powerful ones), and the primary OP metas are Ludwig's or BT builds, or the other three weapon options we have.  I mean, I can't even get annoyed at the meta in BB, because there are so few options.  That being said, the weapons and fashion that are there are great, but super limited.  The game in general made me think over the whole 'quality over quantity thing,' and at first, quality is very important, but for the longevity of not just the PvE but especially the PvP, quantity becomes pretty damn important, if not, just as important.  
 




 I'd say go for a onebro or other challenge run, though that might be a stark contrast/too hard/too frustrating coming from the unbearable heatness of bad-assery OP that is magic/hex in DaS2.


Honestly, I've played pretty much every base type of build in both PvE and PvP, and one of my favorite has been dual wielding.  Whether it's two maces, two swords, two rapiers, just in general, playing in powerstance is fun as fuck! 




 Eh, to be honest, after having played FROM's games for years, I found Bloodborne to be pretty damn easy, especially once I became accustomed to the quicker pace and mechanics.  I loved the original Dark Souls, but the reality is, the awesome level designs hid the fact that it is actually a pretty short game once you learn your way around, but so it goes with most games.  The same thing goes for Bloodborne, which was pretty dissapointing.  Dark Souls 2 was a bit more non-sensical yet straightforward in design, yet it still seems larger and more sprawling, though I don't know or care to know what the actual differences in size and length are, as I enjoyed each experience for what it was, and the best part is always discovering it for the first time.  It becomes pretty damn easy after that, once you know an area and a boss and their tricks.

As for BB, sure, there were a few tough spots, but I was able to kill most bosses in one or two goes, and even the cursed dungeons became trivial very quickly, all without the easy to OP Ludwig's.  
Even the NG+ cycles and lower depth challenges are pretty easy once you get used to them.  Sure, you can get punished easily, and playing carelessly will get you killed in any Souls games, but I think once your familiar with FROM's tropes, secrets, hiding places, etcs., they become quite easier in general.  That being said, between variety, creativity, and nuances of a lot of the weapons and armor, I found a lot more replay value in dark souls and DaS2 than I have in BB, which has been a total bummer, but it is still a masterpiece of a game :)


 




 I thought the closest break-point to 100 was like, 99 agility?  And the next one for more i-frames was 105?  Thanks in advance for your reply :) 




 I though the "el-em-en-o-pee" part of the alphabet was one complex letter :D 




 Dude... I was thinking this too, but you can imagine the depths of madness you would be peering into, attempting to discipher that thing?  It would be like reading the Necronomicon backwards on Friday the 13th after summoning forth Lord Cthulu!  




 LOL 




 Don't take Ambien too long before bed-time either, because then you wind up doing things, like dropping your phone in the toilet :D 




 So why'd you bother to respond at all then?  If you didnt read what i wrote, then you have no actual response for me, as the rest of what I wrote is more important than BB's clunky and limited matchmaking system. Sure, it works, but it working is no substitute or defense for it working well. That, and the fact that you can only invade/be invaded by default in all of three short portions of the game is still pretty lame. As for your reply in general,  it's a pretty dick-head way to go about things. To paraphrase - *'hey, I didn't read what you wrote cuz fuck you, but I am presuming to know what your thoughts, experiences, and opinions are, cuz I'm just that special of an asshole'*


Next time, don't bother, and don't tell me to chill.  And I ain't your fucking 'fam'. What are you, 14? 




 I agree, and at the same time, I don't think it would be altogether impossible for them either, they would probably just reach their sadism threshold much quicker than your ravenous FROM fan :D 




 Yep.  So many games make it nearly impossible for you to lose at all, and even if you do lose or die, BAM, one save/load screen later, you are right back where you were :D


And you were dead on about your above post - it's all about skill.  And that skill can be learned and honed, and it is all about that skill :D 




 But practice and patience and timing your skills with any of FROM's games will definitely improve your odds, and make you a better player intentionally or otherwise, and that process of learning and getting better (as deemed mandatory by the gameplay itself) is what has made FROM games so satisfying...  The point remains:  it is about skill.  The game itself will make you more skilled if you don't give up on it, whether you level up or not. 




 It's not just a lack of weapons, it's a lack of options and builds, and thus creativity and nuance.  The covenants are shit, the options are extremely limited for items and weapons and armor, and the multi-player bell system sucks in the first place (never mind the loading screens).  Don't get me wrong, I love the game, but there is a reason a lot of us have logged far more hours in the previous Souls games in PvE and especially PvP, yet we find ourselves already sated with Bloodborne.  It's a master-piece to be sure, but I didn't (couldn't really) put down any of the previous Souls games for months on end, and I found myself feeling done (for the moment) with Bloodborne in less than two months.  I know I'll be playing it more for sure, and definitely sooner rather than later, but the game is extremely lacking in so many options and diversity and challenges, period. 




 I really don't see them adding enough of a diversity in weapons and armor and gear (and thus creativity and nuance) to make the PvP feel any less samey.  Sure, it was fun at first, but I just don't think the items in game nor the mechanics and shallow covenants leave much room for multi-player (specifically PvP) longeviity  :(

(Hell, even I am already back to playing DaS2 :/) 




 To a degree, I agree, but at the same time, Bloodborne felt fairly easy to me, because once I became adjusted to the new mechanics, I was already accustomed and familiar with FROM's tropes, secrets, and methods.  Sure, there were a few surprises, but aside the defiled chalice and a few other select moments, in most ways, Bloodborne felt pretty damn easy to me, I was able to kill half to most of the bosses on my first or second try, and it was definitely easier than DaS and even a lot of DaS2 for me, and I didn't even use the easy to OP Ludwig's my first playthrough.  


I'm not bitching or complaining, as I love both games, but I am just providing your point with a counter-balance, as BB is extremely lacking when it comes to multi-player and PvP anyhow: never mind the stupid bell-system and the crap loading screens and connectivity problems, there are bigger issues with the shallow covenant system, a lack of invasions, and worst of all the immensely limited builds, not just in weapon choices and fashion, but also creativity and nuance.  A lot of the things you take issue with on DaS2 are the reasons why it made PVP so fun, and have such longeivity, and it is those same reasons that a lot of us are already bored with BB and back to playing DaS2.  Sure, BB is a masterpiece, but it just doesn't have the options for builds and challenge runs and diversity and multiplayer that the previous titles have.
 




 Give it time?  Bugs and health debuff and lack of invasion and bad multiplayer connectivity and shallow covenants and OP weaposn that can 2 shot an invader, etc aside, there is a very distinct lack of builds and options and thus creativity and nuance in this game, and it makes the PvP redundant and boring rather quickly.  I love this game to be sure, I've had some awesome PvP, and it has some of my favorite weapons and combat mechanics, and it is definitely the best game of 2015, but PvP sucks compared to previous souls games.  We've had time, and many players on this subreddit and elsewhere are already gone back to playing DaS2 :/ 




 Which is wierd, since M-Man was still director on DaS2, and he let B-team give us so many PvP options and nuances and covenants and etc :/ 




 I love this game, but with the lack of fashion and weapon options, and the resultant lack of nuances, creativity, and builds, I'd say nowhere near as much as the previous games.  Throw in the shitty multiplayer, the lack of PvP support, and the shallow covenants, and bam, I'm already back to plyaing DaS2, among a lot of other FROM fans.  Sure, I'll be back to play more bloodborne eventually, but in the meantime, I'm already bored with BB PvP :D


Worth noting, I sadly don't see any DLC being much of a remedy for this, unless they make some fairly major over-hauls to a lot of different things... 




 I agree for the most part, though I disagree with the lack of variety not being a major problem in Bloodborne.  It's not just a lack of variety in weapons and armor (fashion) in the game that is a problem, it's the lack of builds and nuances and creativity that results from that.  It is the reason I haven't been playing Bloodborne for the last few weeks (and the same goes for a lot of other people that have posted here and elsewhere).


The lack of variety is a problem, not just for the lack of builds that you can play with in PvE, but it is an even larger blow to the already shitty multiplayer and lack of PvP content.  Coupled with the shallow and near pointless covenant system, it sucks pretty bad.  I actually used a shit ton of variety of weapons on my first and subsequent playthrough in both DaS1 and DaS2, so to me, this lack of variety is a much bigger problem than you make it out to be, and it is the reason I am already sort of burnt out on Bloodborne, and back to playing Dark Souls 2.  


I loved Dark Souls 2.  It wasn't the best SOULS game, but it was the best RPG of the Souls games, and it had an awesome amount of fashion and other options, it was still the best game of 2014, it was still fun piecing together all the lore (though not as original and enigmatic as DeS/DaS, but so goes any trope once it isn't new and shiny any more), and it was and still is the best multiplayer experience in all the souls games for both PvE and PvP.  Surprisingly - coming back to DaS2 after BB makes me appreciate DaS2 even more, and BB just a bit less, though I still consider BB a masterpiece in mystery, horror, and an all around awesome FROM game.  Sure, I think BB has an amazing atmosphere, great design, etc., but there is a reason I played Dark Souls 1 and 2 far more than BB, and there is a reason I am back to playing DaS2 :)


edit:  stuff and junk 




 Sweet!  Now make a few more toons with different builds and take them through that quagmire of fun! :D 




 Problem is, FROM was just too damn good at what they did between weight and commitment/conservation of movement.  I swear, Dark Souls was one of the first, if not the first game I played where I *truly* felt like the weapons really had a worthwhile difference, not just in damage and mechanics, but namely their feel.  A spear felt like a spear, a hammer like a hammer, a sword like a sword, etc - and they have only made it better as time has gone on.  Pretty much every other game I play, most weapons feeel and play nearly exactly the same, and without the rest of the combat/endurance system's depth, it all just looks and feels like I am swinging around a wet noodle :D 




 Yep, and the only thing that really compares with the risk/reward, weighty feel and gameplay, and the satisfaction, are games with similar mechanics - and most of those were inspired by FROM in the first place :D


The rest of the games feel like Hello Kitty Island's Adventure :( 




 It kinda sucks actually.  You get ridiculous amounts of souls from NG+ cycles and the deeper chalice dungeons, and you wind up with nothing to spend them on :( 




 Whoa. They just got goth served.  




 Yep. It's funny that that's the standard FROM set for themselves. You'd be lucky to break 10-20 hours in a lot of games out there, and then seldom or never play them again because they become redundant or weren't that good in the first place. Don't get me wrong. 10-20 hours for most any game is fine with me, so long as it's top notch in terms of mehanics, story, etc, (depends on the type of game and multiplayer), but still, I can't help but be a little disappointed that there isn't as much variety and replayability in both PvE and PvP for bloodborne :| 




 Believable, but again, more like acquaintances and people you really like who you don't seem to see that often.  Sure, at 18, you might have been busy, or you might have been freshly graduated and unemployed and not in university yet, but did you really have intimate relationships with all 60 of those people?  Did you know all of them well?  Would any and all of them helped you move, or help you move dead bodies?  I'm talking about quality and depth over quantity.  Again, I have tens and hundreds of acquaintances (not talking social media), some I know well, some not so well, but as far as "friends" go, again, I reserve that for only the people I have intimate relationships with, people I've known longer than even a few years.  That sort of thing. 




 It's ok, you can just say it - PC gaming is better, for a zillion different reasons.  Never mind how stupid GFWL is and was on DaS1, the point remains, it is a better experience across the board, in software, hardware, and options and mods  :D 




 Right, but he does have a point on DaS being realesed on PC opening up FROM's games to a much wider audience, that in turn brought in a lot more money and fans for FROM, which made sales for DaS2, the DLCs, Bloodborne, and now SOFS what they are.  In short, I'd say, "it made a lot of people happy," but that sounds stupid as fuck, as you can't measure happiness with dollars :P 




 LOL.  I was thinking the same thing.  Realistically, how do you have 20 friends?  I attribute a lot of weight to the word, so 20 sounds high, because it takes a lot of time and energy and emotions to maintain honest, healthy relationships.  Sure, I have many aquaintences, but friends, those people who would be there to help me move bodies, those people who I can spend my time with rather than wasting such a precious resource, well, those are quite fewer in numbers :D
 




 I agree for sure, but I'll take quantity from FROM, as they seldom fail to deliver with the quality.  Bloodborne's awesome level design hid the fact that the game is super short, and it hid it very well.  There are tons of souls fans who are already sort of... dare I say, 'bored with the game', or at least taking breaks from it due to how limited it is in build variety, challenge run options, and multiplayer.  So long as they follow their previous forumlas for DLC (cut content for DaS1 that was completed, or the planned crowns trilogy for DaS2), it will be just fine.  Those DLC's fit, because they weren't just tacked on, they were already heaviliy rooted in the plots and premises.  Worth noting, lots of fans bitched about DaS2 for any number of reasons, some justified, some nit-picking, but they still had a lot of fun with the game and played it for hundreds and thousands of hours. 


The point is, for lots of FROM fans, they couldn't put down the Souls series games for months and years at a time, and not even two months past release, the same fans are already feeling done with BB because it is lacking in the many different options, covenants, and content the previous games have.  In this case, more is better.  Bring it on! 




 But it wasn't a planned expansion per se, it was content from the original game they had to scrap because they ran out of time, hence it fits so well, and is so fucking awesome.  It wasn't additional, it was just completed, and more of the same :D 




 Haha.  Yep.  I too bought a $400 Bloodborne player.  Sony is fortunate that it has such an awesome exclusive, as the multi-platforms are accessible to anyone, and from what I've played and heard, the other exclusives for PS4 have been crap, but it seems AAA gaming has been crap and stagnant for awhile now, which is why gamers welcomed the challenges and mysterious games that FROM offered, as they were actually being creative, original, and trying new things, which both the industry and the player's need.  Here's hoping for at least another exclusive or two to really make the PS4 shine.


My only (mostly only) complaint about BB is that it sucks how short the game is, though the awesome level design hides this fact well, and it also sucks that there really isn't much build, weapon, or armor varieties.  I was also bummed out in how they changed invasions/multi-player mechanics.  I'm already playing SOFS and falling in love all over again with DaS2, and I know I'll be back to play more Bloodborne, but I think back to DaS/Das2 and I couldn't put them down for months on end... 




 Especially when the nearest bonfire is so far away :( 




 Kitten Souls?  :3 




 You hit the nail on the head on pretty much everything worth mentioning.  And not just that difficulty is cool again, the challenge was welcome after so many crap indie and AAA games over the years that make it hard for you to lose period, and at the least, you just save and reload with no real consequence.  The industry was rife for some change in a different direction, and I feel like DeS/DaS was able to capitalize on it without even realizing what they were doing.  I'm not even going to mention how brilliant (intentional and otherwise) their story-telling is when it comes to the video game medium, as it uses the format in a way most games don't even consider.... can't wait for more :D 




 Yes, some bugs and glitches are almost expected, just like you can find typos in most any written text in a hard-copy book or online, but the product not working in the first place is the biggest fucking no-no! 




 What other people explained stands, and while it might just seem like invasions are a trolling and obnoxious mechanic (and so it often is), the reality is, it really adds a few more layers of excitement, fear, and the unknown to the game, deepening the game-play experience and atmosphere.  It helps keep you on your toes, weigh your decisions more, etc. :/ 




 Yep.  I'm already back to playing DaS2, both vanilla with my brother, and SoFS solo, and I gotta admit, what makes these games so fun is the massive amounts of builds and challenge runs available.  I will no doubt go back to playing Bloodborne from time to time for both PvE and PvP, but they are both very limited at the moment.  Bloodborne's awesome level design hides the fact that the game is actually quite short, and not really that large or sprawling, but what is there is 10/10 for sure.  What is truly lacking is diversity in builds and weapons, and thus options in both PvE and PvP, and it really hurts the fuckin game.  Aside some mind-blowing, game-changing DLC, I don't see there being any remedy for it, and I just don't see it having the same longevity as the Souls games.  Sadly, that's not even getting into the shallow, pointless covenants, the shitty connection and multiplayer issues, etc.


I'd rather FROM start on Bloodborne 2, DeS2, or anything else, rather than focusing on BB DLC, though a solid DLC release somewhere down the line would definitely be welcome :D

 




 Yeah, there are no worthwhile exclusives out for the PS4 at the moment, and triple A and big budget gaming has pretty much been shit the last few years, aside a few formulaic series of games (like Battlefield and CoD, but even those are pretty redundant and unoriginal at this point.  The point is, thank gosh for FROM. 




 At the right time?  That's an understatement. Between die-hard souls fans buying PS4's specifically for Bloodborne, and there being no worthwhile exclusives for the console in the first place, it sure was the right time.  That, and not to mention, big-budget gaming has been pretty much total shit as of late... 




 You sure your at the right doors?  Did you go to the king's gate instead of shrine?  Etc? 
























 You just made me realize that for all the wheel-chair bound cripple fucks, there isn't a single handicap ramp in all of Yharnam.  Yharnam is a dick to handicapped people! 




 I tried that trick last night (was using USB becuase PS+/internet were being bitches), and I received one blood rock in 20-30 tries.  Guess RNgeezusmotherfuckeralready hates me :/


Then I got bored, and moved on to a depth 5 dungeon that had the headless bloodletting beast, and I killed him about 15 times, but nothing other than gems and chunks dropped there either :.


Will try again soon I guess.  Thanks for the info.
 




 I'd go something like 25 end, 25 STR and 50 SKL instead, for visceral damage, and because I love the burial blade and the SKL weapons in general, and your LHB can still have an ridiculous AR of 850+ even with a SKL build.  Supposedly the LHB gets slightly more AR out of STR, but the SKL weapons are much more fun imo, and unless you wanted a dedicated STR build, I feel like the SKL version has more versatility.  Either way, the above is what I would use for a skill build, whether or not you wanted to use the OP LHB, and either way the build will still remain competitive. 




 Yeah, but Evelyn spam builds are the equivelant of magic spam builds from DaS1/2.  I'd rather play the game, but some people think this is fun PvP I guess.  Even more annoying are the people who sit there spamming the shotguns.  That being said, you have to play super patient and let them run out of bullets, but I usually run out of patience and run in, and half the time I die in 2 or 3 hits from the fast rips of their Chikage.  FYI, in the last few days, I don't think I've seen a single BT build outside of reddit dungeon hizzngr.  It's pretty much the meta there, but I hardly see it elsewhere, which is nice.  And it's a shame, because I find BT builds fun to play, just not fun to play with in PvP :D 




 Were you able to get more than one blood rock from the same boss in the same chalice glyph?  I swear, I killed CE a zillion times, but I only ever got one.  I received a blood rock on my second CE kill, then I killed him another 20 times and didn't see anything, which lead me to believe that you can't get more than one blood rock from a single chalice glyph, but I would love to hear if that is possible.  How many times did you have to kill him to get more than one blood rocks?  One in 25 kills?  One in 50 kills?  Etc?  Thank you. 




 But being that most PvP fights last 20-30 seconds, there just isn't enough time for more invasions.  I really do miss the 1 v 1 v 1 or the 2 v 2s and etc. 




 Dude.  Now I want to google bloodborne porn...but I am also kind of afraid to...  I'd be all for hunter vs. doll, but with how weird the internet is, I'd probably find Rom vs. Vicar Amelia or a Snatcher :D 




 Yep.  I took a break from Bloodborne pretty quickly, whereas I couldn't put down DaS and DaS2 for a minimum of probably 5-6 months each, and even then, I came back for more, and I did it quite often.  And what game did I take a break from Bloodborne to play?  SOFS...and then vanilla DaS2 to do a full playthrough with my brother.  I'm back to playing PvP in BB, and while it's fun, I also find it very...lacking :/ 




 FYI - I went to hizzngr3 last night, and not much has changed - though I got just as much shot-gun spam as I did Evelyn spam, so if anything, it was just more annoying, but the matches seemed to come faster than Nightmare Frontier (with a toon I just pushed up to 120 from 110).  I'm thinking I'll back up my toon, then push him up to 150 to see how I like it.  Thanks for the info so far, and I appreciate your efforts to try to bring up the validity and fun of having a higher level meta to the community. 




 I think the biggest flaw when it comes to the PvP meta level discussion is that people keep trying to treat this game like Dark Souls 3, but it isn't.  Sacrafice has been important for level metas in the souls games, and it is a very valid point, but this isn't a souls game, and sacrafice doesn't mean much when we intentionally stay low level, yet farm 27% and other max level gems to kill each other in two or three hits anyway (and I don't blame people for staying competitive), but imo these have been the fundamental problems people have been complaining about for months now, as two to three shot PvP in the clunky multi-player system of Bloodborne can grow stale, samey, and the waiting periods to invade/be invaded (even with hunter's marks) usually last longer than the matches themselves.  We can't just go to a dragon or blood bro and summon them like we used to, or use a red orb to invade whereever and whenever we feel like it.


A higher meta gives us more survivability and more build options, and these have been lacking in standard meta Bloodborne PvP.  As for trying to treat this game like DaS3, let's look at what we left behind, and what the argument for a lower meta always fails to address:

 nbsp;

Weight/Armor/Poise and all that it entails:  In BB, everyone is a ninja.  There is no sacrafice here, no gear choices, no armor vs. weight, no diversity, no creativity, and no heavy armor, or light armor with better all rounded resists, and no armor with stats or buffs.  What is there in terms of resists is just short of negligible, especially when you consider fashion!

 nbsp;

Weapons - We have very few choices, and even less choices when you consider the many who flock to to stay competitive by using the two most easy to OP weapons in the game (LHB and Chikage+eve).  In past games, we had infusions, boss weapons, and all manners of options, but they were never as straightforward and OP as stacking 27% damage x 3.  There was more nuance (aside cheesy metas), but what the hell, eat my 850AR LHB or my 700AR Chikage that swings faster than a dagger!

 nbsp;

Movesets (quick vs. strong attack) - Let's be honest.  Movesets don't matter as much when it comes to PvP in this game, as most anything beyond dashes, rolls, or regular quick attacks can be easily punished in so many ways.  Sure, you might be able to sneak in the occasional jump attack or charge attack, or strong attack to mix it up, but there is a reason why people spam fast attacks:  becuase the game and the play-style of it makes it too easy to punish anything else.

 nbsp;

Buffs:  There are no survivability buffs, be it through magic, miracles, or items.

 nbsp;

Competition and game mechanics:  This goes back to what I've mentioned before and putting it all together:  We have ninja builds with no armor/weight options, no survivability buffs, less HP than ever before (especially when you are the invader), little build variety, and weapons that are easy to make ridiculously powerful, and thus the low level meta is a two to three shot, 20 to 30 seconds PvP match.  I think these are the main reasons so many people come on here to complain that the BB PvP scene is boring, stale, and has less longevity, and oh by the way, they are back to playing DaS2.


As for myself, I've come to prefer matches with healing, as they last longer than 20 or 30 seconds, and are more enjoyable and make for more thrilling fights, and with how slow and clunky multi-player can be, it becomes even more relevant.  If I PvP for a half hour, I'd prefer four or five, three to five minute matches, rather than the commonplace occurrence of eight to ten 30 second matches, with the waiting periods between the matches being longer than the fights themselves.


Edit:  I'd like to add that the two to three shot meta is also kind of frustrating, as your latency test for the other player can put you one swing away from death, and leaves little to no room for experimentation and lag.


 




 But, but, don't people like dying to Evelyn spam plus two hits from a bloody chikage?!  :P


In all seriousness, I am all for build diversity and I love the idea of expanding them, as having all of five builds is pretty lame.  And being that match-making can be clunky and slow, I am all for PvP fights lasting longer than 15-25 seconds.  I think 125 is a good meta. 




 Bloodborne is a great game to be sure, but I would have been happy with a multi-player system that didn't suck, covenants that didn't suck, and more than four "builds," becuase the lack of options and creativity sucks :/


 




 Says the thousands of people who "hated it," yet still played it longer than any other game of 2014, who played it more than DaS, and who still play it to this day.  The PvP is better and has more longevity than Bloodborne, that's to be sure, and the multiplayer in general is so much smoother and easier :D


If you're gonna talk shit about it, fine, but that's your opinion, but a lot of people still love it, and still play it, and still enjoy it, even if it isn't the best souls game in the souls series (it is still the best RPG in the souls series). 




 What have you put out into the world, from your own head, for yourself?  Thanks in advance :) 




 I have that one printed up already.  It's what I've been primarily using the last few weeks, and it's pretty great as well, thank you.  I liked the previous spreadsheet MrBrokewilly posted because it had a lot more details and info about other items and bosses you find within most of the glyphs :D 




 Ah, ok.  This was one of the questions I was definately more curious about.  Thank you. 




 Yeah.  I've done that, I usually shoot him to stagger him, then catch up and slap him around like a bitch, but I've had it that the doll puppets get in the way, or I get snagged on a corner, and etc, and the worst of it was a boring circular 10 minute chase :D 




 I think Micolash was actually a missed opportunity, as the concept is kinda cool ( a maze/puzzle boss), but it wound up lame and annoying as fuck.  It is an extremely easy fight too, but careful, because he might one-shot you.  At low insight, he would just run in circles (often not running into the first room), and occasionally jump through a mirror, and it's just not a fun fight to chase a boss in circles for 10 minutes, and then chase him some more, then have him one shot you, then rinse and repeat, and pwn him the next time around.   




 Yep.  I think it was a missed opportunity for something even greater (a creepy/puzzle/maze boss), but it wound up clunky, lame, and easy, with the occasional one-shot, which just isn't fun or challenging really, especially if you spent 10 minutes chasing him in circles at low insight :D 




 I want moar Sen's :D 




 I'll sacrafice a goat to Chemosh and hope for the best :D 




 Oooh, thanks!  Will have to try this!


Edit:  also, do you happen to know or remember what the other bosses are off-hand?  Thanks again. 




 Eh, I don't think this is the same bull-shit cliche of *"it could all or was all a dream,"* as the dreams in this game are as real as the waking world, more akin to another dimension or facet of reality.  It does make things convoluted and obtuse as you put it, but it's nowhere near as trite and obnoxious as the whole *it was all a dream* cliche.


Edit:  And while there is the curious love-craftian mechanic of insight vs. madness, it isn't as fleshed out as it could of or should have been, but at least this is one of the few love-craftian games out there with an actual Lovecraft mechanic in it (so many games miss out on this awesome opportunity).  That being said, I don't think there is much (if any) room for the "madness makes anything possible" idea, because as convoluted and obtuse as everything is, it is still fairly straight forward:  old ones, hunters, queen Yharnam, etc, are so powerful they can maintain consciousness through force of will; there are dream worlds that are as real as the waking world; the great ones exert their influence from beyond them, and the humans in the waking world try to exert their wills on bringing them through, etc.  If anything, my critique of the game is akin to yours - there seems to be quite a few contradiction in items and descriptions (not talking about the general FROM vagueness and connect the dots method, I mean straight up contradictions), and if anything, this story is more straight forward with more given answers than previous titles - I think the one thing that just trips everyone up is how weird it all is, rather than say, the consistency and repetition of fallen kingdoms and fallen gods and heroes that come to supplant them in the souls series.  Your thoughts? 




 Fire does decent damage on him (oil urns+moltovs, fire papers, etc).


You can throw blood cocktails to distract him for a few seconds (to either heal, use antitodes, or attack).


You definately want a few antidotes on hand in case you get poisoned, as it can drain your HP super quick.


To make it a sure-shot, I'd stock up on the above listed items, then use an insight to summon Alfred, and don't be stingy with your items that way you won't waste half your items and be left without the kill.  Good hunting to you  |o_ 




 That is the sweetest spread-sheet I have seen so far, but it has no info regarding boss blood-rock drop rates, or good dungeons to farm for them.  Thank you though. 




 Haha.  No sweat.  I don't blame you.  After my next and last toon that still needs to finish the story line chalices is done with them, I will probably never run a story chalice again.  Funny enough, I do enjoy the randomized chalices, as it's fun seeing the monster combos and grouping (and how totally fucking difficult they can be) at times, as well as hunting for loot. 




 Yeah - dun sweat it.  You'll catch on.  I've been a long time souls player and FROM fan, and after being familiar with all the tropes and secrets that FROM tends to put in their games, I beat this game very quickly (I didn't mean to, nor was I even playing it that much), and I found it to be the easiest and fastest game so far, once I got used to the change of pace/mechanics from previous games that is.  Given more time, you'll wonder how you ever sucked so bad in the first place :P 




 Yeah, but Destiny is one of the shittiest, shiny turds ever produced :D 




 FROM games made most action-RPG type games and MMO's feel like hello kitty's island adventure when it comes to combat.  There just isn't enough depth and weight and impact and conservation of movement and resource management to make other game's combat feel as challenging, heavy, and engaging :/ 




 As the title says, I was curious if anyone has had decent luck farming specific chalices for blood rock drops from bosses?  I have probably completed 5 to 10 depth 5 chalices on two different toons each since the patch, and so far, I think I have one blood rock drop for one toon.


That being said, the drop came from a cursed dungeon, and as such, I haven't seen a blood rock drop from a non-cursed depth 5 dungeon boss.  Can anyone else confirm whether or not blood rocks can drop from non-cursed dungeon bosses?  


Also, in regards to good chalice codes (ie, quick, easier bosses, etc) to farm blood rock boss drops from, does anyone have codes that also include mobs/bosses that drop other valuable gems - such as the high tier 27% triangle and radial gems?  Thanks in advance for your input and your replies. 




 I hear ya.  I've completed the chalices on 3 or 4 characters (with one more, my BT toon, to go), and like I said, at first it was a pain in the ass, but then I started breezing through them, so it has become less of a pain.  But what I meant was, let's say you get summoned into the defiled to get the pthumerian ihyll chalice (the one with the queen), even then, you might have the chalice now, but then you'd still have to go back and farm for materials to create that one for yourself, no?  Not to mention, if you wanted to farm specific chalices for specific loot, you'd be unable to since you lacked the root chalices. 




 Did you have to go back and farm for chalice materials then to be able to even create the chalice, then?


I mean, as much as I was annoyed at having to run chalices on toons to run depth 5 and so forth, the fact that the SRRC is a total clunky piece of shit when it comes to connecting for multi-player has made the skip options seem dubious to me.  I'd rather just run the dungeons quickly and get them over with (it doesn't take that long once you know them) than sit for 15-20 minutes at a time at some off-hand chance to even be summoned into the correct dungeon.  How long did it take you to connect anyhow?  Thanks :D 




 I agree on some points, but to be less one-sided, if you play the chalices level appropriately, they aren't as boring, and if you thoroughly explore and loot all the mandatory story chalices in order, you won't have to farm any materials at all, as you will wind up with more than enough materials to create the story chalices.


Edit: worth noting, I do enjoy exploring and seeing what challenges and enemy varieties the depth five R/F/C dungeons throw at me :D 




 Seriously man.  Read what you wrote.  You sound like you are 16 years old. I was attempting to salvage the situation, but it seems you can't even face up to what I wrote, and you obviously can't have an adult conversation about it. 


That being said, you are paranoid and delusional if you think I'd create multiple accounts to upvote myself. 




 Good point.  




 Holy shit!  Neil Young, the first hunter! 




 Hmm, maybe 125 is the sweet spot, but at that point, you'll be getting matched with 150's and higher anyhow, no? 




 Point taken, and yes it is easy to get the gems, but praisethesun is right when he points out that people keep treating this game's PvP like it's dark souls 3, when it is not. We've eliminated poise, buffs, medium armor, heavy armor, the weight system (and gear choices that it entails), and a few other odds and ends, yet what we have are weapons that do more damage than ever before, and for some reason, in a game with clunkier match making and long loading screens, it's no surprise that people are dissatisfied with the PvP experience where everyone kills each other in 2 to 3 hits.  




 Yep. My uncanny BB is siting at something like 650-700 AR with those gems (and those are the weaker gems, not the highest you can go) which still isn't as much as my uncanny LHB that is at 850 with plain old 26-27% gems in it, but I prefer BB for PvP anyhow, and it has and takes a lot more finesse :D


Edit - worth mentioning that you can get lots of blood chunks and the exact gems you need for the uncanny BB and regular BoM (killing 2 birds with one stone) by farming layer 1 chalice bosses. Just look up the appropriate glyphs.  




 Diversity?  We only have five builds in this game... but you do bring up some good points :) 




 I have yet to try the 150 pvp meta, but I love the idea of it, as there are only five builds in this game, and what the hell do our 'unique' (one of five) builds matter when anyone running the current standard meta can kill each other in two to three hits?  PraiseTheSun has a point - trying to keep a low level meta of mid-game level, yet wielding the very end of game 27% damage gems is pretty ridiculous. 




 I don't.  Get an uncanny burial blade and fit in three +8-9% physical damage with +60-70 flat arcane damage gems :D  




 Well, in DaS, there is the brilliant writing that was snuck in there from Oscar (who gives you the estus flask) in the beginning, right before he dies:  he says, 'perhaps you can continue my chosen undead quest to ring the bells, and *keep the torch lit so to speak.'*.  Big allusion to the whole kindling the flame thing, but even then, he is handing us his quest, and the answer is right there, hidden in plain sight.


We go to Yharnam, and we are faced with a similar mysterious dilemma, though we actually know our character was there to seek paleblood (as reiterated by the blood minister).  The difference is, if anything, our PC in BB has a motivation, even if we don't know anything about it, though in DaS, our toon was just rotting in a cell until Oscar came and freed him, and later gave us his quest.  The point is, they are equally mysterious, and equally vague, though I can see why you would think what you think.

With DaS, Oscar is someone else putting their quest on us, and in BB, we have a quest, we just don't seem to remember much (or know much about it) in the first place.  And just as well as DaS is written with that information in plain-sight, BB is written well too, as I think the blood minister gives us the biggest clue of all:  "Where's an outsider like you to begin?  With a bit of *Yharnam* blood of your own."  Dude is straight up injecting us with the dead queen's blood (the same blood that has corrupted all), and thus begins our mysterious adventure to keep the torch lit, I mean, seek the paleblood.


But I'd agree, but I don't think it is the story itself that it is lacking.  It is the...movement and timing maybe?  I don't know how to put it, but it does feel a bit jumpy or off at times, but to me, it also sort of suited the cosmic horror nature of the game.  Maybe it was the whole 'hi gothic horror adventure, holy shit SURPRISE MOTHERFUCKER SPACE SQUIDS!!1!' thing that threw you off? 




 Wow.  And you are a clear example of a presumptuous, jump down your dick internet asshole who decides to be hostile and ridiculously aggressive for no apparent reason, other than, fuck you, I guess?  As if I somehow had threatened the core of your existence?  Why are you so sensitive dude? (and I mean that seriously).  

 nbsp;

Did vaati kill your mother and copy your work too?  I mean, it's ok, we all have our own dispositions, and I'm sensitive too, but I try not to come out the gate foaming at the mouth, calling people douche bag for their opinion, making assumptions about what they believe, and in general acting like a total cunt.  Sure, in the post you responded to, I said 'I think OP is being hypocritical,' and he was being hypocritical.  He made the post (only to delete it later) to make a knee-jerk claim that his content was stolen before he even confronted the person in question about it, and then he tells other not to act so knee-jerkingly after he started the shit in the first place?  How is that not hypocritical?

 nbsp;

And speaking of word usage, I find it pretty damn funny that you bring up how irrelevant word usage is, while the very root behind the subject at hand is the particulars of language that FROM uses in their games - and that language makes all the difference in these games, as well as in real life and art and language and poetry and everything else.  You discount the power of words, here of all places?  That's pretty goddamned ridiculous, so don't tell me that words and semantics don't matter, though I suppose you might be one of those people whose words don't mean shit to them, because they don't value their own word, honor, or integrity.  But I don't know.  So far you've yelled at me like an asshole, but I don't know where you stand with integrity and honor.

 nbsp;

Lastly - I don't know about you, but I don't care for drama queens.  I'm too old for that shit, and too old for random internet asshole arguments too, but I'll entertian this all a bit more:  if your wife/GF/SO thought you were cheating on her (whether it was true or not) would you rather her,

A) confront you in private first, and discuss it there first before jumping to conclusions?  or

B)  Kick in the door to a family and community party or event, and have her accuse you in front of everyone?

 nbsp;

Because OP did B.  He did option B with little no no proof.  To be fair, OP did credit a bunch of people in his essay (as one should, and no, I am not cool with plagiarism), from anonymous users who helped him come to his final conlusions, and people who helped him put it all together, so at least he has that going for him.  And to be thorough, I also threw out the names of other "original" content creators in other posts, so chill out with your assumptions.  You know it's not a bad thing that there are say, more than one band making original music, or one artist making one kind of art, or one director making movies, or one DeS/DaS fan making fan videos, right?  Sure, give credit where credit is due - to the originals and to the people who helped set the bar and garner interest in a field and who pioneered something, but it doesn't mean that it has to or should stop there.... 




 Yep.  I never realized how much I'd miss boss-soul weapons, the clunky upgrade paths of DaS1 or even the simplified infusions of DaS2.  It was never as OP as say, damage +27% x 3, and at least you had different classes of armor (as well as buffS) that could counter those harder hitting weapons and spells anyhow.  (And few seem to take this into consideration compared to level metas in previous games:  that we used to have poise, armor that had weight vs. defences vs. elemental resists, rather than mostly fashion, etc)


I can sort of see from a design view, since there were so few weapons, they wanted to make them more customizable, but RNG gem farming (or any farming for that matter) isn't the best game design or use of a player's time imo.  Off hand though, I'm not sure how they could have achieved said customization, aside carrying over some form of infusions, or maybe just have less gem slots.  And then there is balancing for PvE and PvP as well, so I'm not sure how that would have looked with infusions either, but I digress.  I'll back up my save in the days to come and try out this 150 meta.


And here are a few last questions for you - what is your actual vitality at on your 150 toons?  And what does that total health pool look like?  Do you use it with or without health runes?  


And have you tried any other PvP hot-spots with the level 150 meta?  If so, which one is the best with consistent and frequent match-making?  I don't want to feel like I am stuck in nightmare frontier for an eternity.  It'll be like the iron keep bridge all over again :D


Edit:  The more I think about this, the more it makes sense.  People keep clinging to the point of builds and the sacrafice we make for them (which has always been important in these games), which does have merit, but they totally fail in the lower meta argument in every other regard since they dismiss the fact that we no longer have poise, armor weights (and the sacrafices we made for gear choices), better armor and elemental resists, magical buffs, and instead of simple weapon upgrades and infusions, what we do have are gems that make us do ridiculous damage.  


Besides, there are only four builds in this game (five if we include quality as a build in itself, which we can and should), but aside pure lower level builds, a lot of builds still dip into secondary stats anyhow (Ie, STR usually has some SKL, BT usually has some SKL for untransformed chikage, etc), so it's not like we are going overboard anyhow, or making our toons be masters at everything.  I think people really are comparing BB to the Souls games too much, and trying to treat it as more of the same is gimping the gameplay. 




 Yeah, but DaS and BB were both very specific with item placement, and there were usually specific reasons as to why items were where you find them, or why you receive items from specific enemies (not including RNG chalices).  And being that they specifically make Caryll out to be a mystical genius, it seems kinda odd that all of a sudden, any old asshole can now understand and create runes.  So far, I don't think it is due to randomized item drops, I just think it was oversight on their behalf in the item descriptions :D 




 Yep.  And a lot of us enjoy a good, challenging and more evenly matched fight.  If I was to say, co-op with a friend that I was much higher level than, I would either use a completely un-upgraded weapon, or fight with my bare hands to make it more on par, but I have yet to do that anyhow :D 




 Bingo.  He was constantly rooted in place due to the slow recover time, and I was constantly getting flinched by buckshot in my crotch.  Either way, was one hell of a party.  It was satisfying once I pinned him to a wall and shredded him with my saw spear.  From there, it took about 5 minutes of wandering to finally even find the host (as it was for a co-op round).  RIP Papa G 




 Ah, bloodborne huh? 




 You're only a week late, but to be thorough, I didn't say he IS a dick.  I said he is being a dick about this.  Apparently he agreed to to some degree, as he deleted his post. 




 In regards to the previous posts on this topic about level metas, I do think you're right about one thing - it is kind of oxymoronic that people want to cap their builds at 75-100, yet farm for the 27% gems.  Between the clunky multi-player and the loading screens, I don't understand why people enjoy this as much as they do.


At that point, if you're going to use the highest gems, why not bring up the meta to 125-150, that way people won't be dieing in 2-3 hits?  Or why not stay 100 but use no gems, or why not level to 150, and not use any gems there either, even though that winds up being more like a war of attrition...
 




 Yeah, I whomped a dude last night who just kept spamming his blunderbuss.  I usually see pistols and evelyn's more than the shot-gun spread weapons, but those pellets are obnoxious when they make you stutter, and yet, brings no real advantage because not either him nor I him could do anything about it with a follow up attack... 




 The coolest thing is that you can make an awesome SKL build that still can rock LHB for 800+ AR, and still utilize the BB to max potential.  




 You don't need arcane to be more than 15 if you just want to use the tools, as the BoM and BB get squat for damage from arcane. You just have to gem them properly, which are the +physical damage/+flat arcane damage gems. Both weapons are monsters once you socket them correctly. 

Edit: you just need 18 arcane for augur. And if you make the build right, you can sit at around level 100-110 and also rock LHB for shit tons of damage too, while still having 50 SKL for good visceral damage.  




 I think it is the Queen's blood, and with FROM's history of hiding answers in plain-sight, I think the blood-minister in the cutscene tells us exactly what we are taking:  "Where's an outsider like you to begin?  With a bit of *Yharnam* blood of your own."  After all, the city is named after her, and it sprung up around Laurence and the healing church he founded.  


The rest of my theory is conjecture:  that the great one's blood is indeed pure, hence, there are some pthumerians who didn't go full beast, but once you start ingesting second-rate, second-generation blood, enter super PMS beast mode! 




 DaS2:  "*You will stand before the gates of the kindom, without even really knowing why."*  -The Firekeeper Narrator at the beginning of DaS2.  


This is a fairly accurate description of pretty much every FROM game - we have vague ideas of what's going on, and we have to find our own purpose within the complex web of events that happened or are going to happen.  My PC was motivated in BB.  I wanted to know what the hell was going on, but the story is and was, I was being duped and puppeted by others, until I said fuck this and ate some aborted babies and then killed the moon prescence and transcended into a squid.  Take that bitch-ass MP! 




 Another thing I see tossed around loosely:  the original blood/medium used for ministration, and the time-line about the city of Yharnam itself.  Please correct me if I am wrong:


We know the story pretty much started with the discoveries at Byrgynwyrth, and the split came when Laurence left to pursue the power of blood (and founded the church), but the issue I have is that I see everyone talk about it as if Laurence set up a church in Yharnam, whereas, I'm pretty sure that several in-game item descriptions indicate that Yharnam pretty much sprang up around Laurence and the healing church.  Hell, it's even named after the Pthumerian Queen, which would be a hell of a coincidence if it was founded before Laurence got there to found the church.  The other thing I mentioned, is the medium itself.  I think the beast plague comes from second-rate blood.  Byrgynwyrth/Laurence didn't find unadulterated kin or great one blood imo, they found incestuous Queen Yharnam blood.  Given FROM's history of hiding things in plain-sight, the original doctor tells us exactly what he is giving us:  *"some Yharnam blood of our own."*  The transfusion we are given is the same corrupt blood of Queen Yharnam that everyone else has been using.


Again, just like the seeming continuity error I mentioned on my previous post on this topic, I see these details glossed over or mixed-up constantly, and I'd like to see it cemented in place if it is true, or thrown out (all if possible) if it isnt.


Your thoughts?

 




 Someone once pointed out that Wilhem indeed wants you to kill Rom, hence he points at the lake - he wants Rom to no longer hide or block the ritual(s), the implication being that he wants you to see the madness for yourself to stop it, and this goes back around to the Bygynwerth/church split, as we know Wilhem wanted to stop experimenting with blood, hence he wants you to stop the church/choir/mensis.  All the notes about 'the spider hiding rituals' seem to coincide with this, as he is directly keeping the red moon at bay, and the summoning of the one reborn.  But if you interpret all that slightly differently, there is another possibility that the choir (that's why the hunter is there guarding wilhem) placed Rom where he is, so it could hide their dark rituals from the rest of the populace, and as you suggested, the events in Yahur Guhl could just coincide with time passing.  I believe the former, not the latter, but the latter would still make sense in certain context.


I always thought Rom looked more like a caterpillar than a spider.  Also, we get kin blood from him, not great one.  I was thinking that Rom is possibly kin, yet to evolve into an actual great one.  I was also thinking that the husk-like fossil thing in the choir church that Ebriatis is at, could possibly have been her husk, but that wouldn't make much sense, since she was already 'the great one who was left behind or abandoned,' so it wouldn't make sense if she metamorphisized later...


edit:  In answer to your other question, if wilhem did indeed create or summon or place Rom where he is to stop the mensis/choir/church rituals and practice, it wouldn't be inconsistent per se, as Rom is seemingly just a band-aid to the problem, a temporary fix, and not a final and actual solution, so Wilhem's desire is that you put a full stop to it, rather than rely on his temporrary solution.


Ahem, I think we only have more questions now... 




 But we don't know if she gave birth to a great one in the times of ancient Pthumeru, do we?  What we know is she is dead, and it seems the great ones descended in current times to impregnate her, because like the hunters and gherman and Mic Cage, she can retain consciousness by force of will. 




 One seeming continuity error that annoys me in game is the description that says *"master wilhem would have been proud of Caryll's runes,"* implying that Wilhem never got to see the fruit of Caryll's work, yet, Wilhem is in possession of the eye Rune.  Worse still, in all the biggest lore posts and videos, I've never seen that seeming error mentioned.  I've heard that same description of 'wilhem would be proud' quoted, and all manners of things related to them, but I have yet to see anyone say 'there is a discrepency here.'


Your thoughts? 




 Yeah.  I shouldn't have used duct tape :/ 




 Is it a caccoon casing?  For all we know it is a husk of her caccoon, though I don't know why it has the name it has, or why it is where it is per se.  As OP said, it is very similar to Ron the Funky Caterpillar... 




 Yep, though the initial transform attack into the 2hand version is too slow  




 Heal Problems?  Learn to toss numbing mist vials to keep them from healing, toss poison daggers, or learn to shoot and interupt and/or parry+visceral the heals.

Learning to parry?  Time your reactions better.  Don't blindly shoot and cancel out your own parries, and don't be so jumpy that you dodge backwards or sideways every time you shoot, as you might have gotten a parry (lag) and need to dodge forward to follow it up with a visceral 




 Eburietasu-son say, *"SUDOKU!"* 




 If you've cleared the chalices (or are at least to the depth 4 story chalices), just put on a moon rune or three and use a hunter's mark to clear a room or two in some of the depth 4 to 5 dungeons, rinse, and repeat.  You can have millions of blood echoes in 15-30 minutes. 




 SHUT UP TOM GIT GUD SKRUB!


Just kidding.  Yeah, there are some great people here, and there are also plenty of unnecessarily hostile, jump-down-your-throat-for-no-reason type ding-bats here that will defend their angry, insecure dellusions to the death, so don't be too discouraged when you find the typical internet assholes crawling out the wood-work  :D

Good hunting to you o/ 




 Don't give up skeleton!  I mean, pull the lever!  Wait, what's going on again? 




 Yep.  Very linear and short, though the awesome level design helped hide that in BB :| 




 The runes and rocks I have experienced, but I have never seen a blood chunk in a chalice dungeon, aside the recent post patch boss drops, and the one time a gargoyle happened to drop one :/ 




 To be thorough though, bloodtinge builds are really fun to play imo, even outside PvP.  Besides.  We only have four or five builds at most in this game, so I can't really blame anyone for using one quarter of the options available to us... 




 I know journalism typically appeals to a four to eighth grade reading level, but aside being a general skrub, it's a sin to use the words *getting* and *like* in professional writing  :D 




 And BB doesn't?  All that cooperation with Sony and they couldn't set up a little something for FROM for BB?  That's a bummer, but even then, I don't see why they couldn't have just morphed the summon signs to messengers that sat there ringing the bells for you, that way you could still easily and classically find a summon bell messenger (red or white for pvp and pve), activate it, and expect and know that most of the times without fail, that person you just summoned will be coming into your world, rather than, *I'm wasting an insight to ring a bell, then hope and wait for someone to show up, and half of the time, it just fails out, and I have wasted 10-15 minutes of my play time, or even longer with less success when it comes to the SRRC* 




 Yeah.  I hate the way multi-player in general works in this game.  It worked so smoothly in DaS2, and even more smoothly in DaS by comparison, and I don't see how or why it was such a step backwards for BB :( 




 I had previously never seen a blood chunk come from a CD's treasure chests or tombs, and I still haven't, but I have received a lot of chunks from layer 1 and 2 bosses in depth 4-5 dungeons :D

edit: clarity 




 I could say no based on my experience, as one of my toons who had previously looted a blood rock from a chest in one of each dungeon type received a blood rock from a layer 3 boss in a depth 5 dungeon. 


Edit: worth noting, I don't know how rare the blood rocks drop rate is, as I've cleared maybe 4 or 5 depth 5 dungeons between the toon I mentioned and another toon post patch, and I've only seen the one blood rock drop so far.  




 For sure.  I know if I was a new player to the souls/borne franchises, it'd be more akin to the wonder of our first trips through DeS and DaS, so the familiarty and suspicion made the game less intimidating, though I still found my first playthrough very engrossing, and the atmosphere is superb to be sure.


I agree with you about the armor thing being liberating, I really do, especially compared to how wonky and undependable poise wound up being in DaS2, but I still appreciated that being light weight meant you had to sacrafice stats and gear to move fast, and it wasn't a simple matter of aesthetics.  And while I appreciate the fashion options without having to upgrade all your armor to stay competitive, I actually think upgrading armor would be a good option to counter how ridiculously powerful the blood gems are in BB's PvP.


Armor choices aside, (besides pure fashion), and aside when plenty of us say fashion  stats,  armor wasn't just a matter of choosing stats carefully, it was (and still is, DaS2 pvp is pretty great) also choosing gear more carefully.  Sure, no weight in BB is cool, and being able to equip a weapon in 2 slots on each hand w/o weight is great, but even that is a step backwards from DaS2 where we could have three on each hand, though managing that could be clunky or weigh you down too much, but it was still an option that a lot of people used.  


But all that being said, I think I might be using the wrong lens to appreciate BB (at least, the end game/pvp) for what it is.  Just like while DaS2 was not the best Souls game, it was and is the best RPG (and pvp) game in the series.  Instead of trying to look at BB like more of the same, I feel like I should look at it like others haev suggested - almost more like a fighting/arcade game.  While I don't agree with the 150 meta per se that these same people have mentioned, they do have a point that it intentionally plays very differently.  I welcome 'differently,' but it is hard to enjoy it when differently winds up being limited, and definitely more limited than the previous FROM game. 




 Biased how?  Like I said, I think BB is a master-piece of a game, and I guarantee nothing will come close to this game for the rest of 2015, at least as my personal favorite of the year, but that doesn't mean it doesn't have its faults.


The game itself is actually very linear.  There are only a handful of optional areas that people can miss, but that doesn't make it any less linear.  And while you can skip those along with a boss or two in the main game, it is all still very straight-forward, as you always start and end in the same place.  Again, the awesome level design hides this fact very well.  I know we could talk about the story chalices here, but again, those are very linear, and I don't think they are designed well enough to be able to talk about them as if they are some solid content, or at least, in the same category as the main game.


As for the armor, while most of it looks very cool, and it does have stats, most of it is comparable, besides a few odd instances where you might want frenzy resist or lightning resist.  As you know, the important difference is that past games had poise, and different classes of armor with weights that complimented different builds, and thus, on top of a lot of fun weapon options, you also had your fashion/armor options, which played very differently, from light and fast, to medium and versatile, to heavy and slow like a tank.


At first I thought it was cool that everyone in BB was a ninja fast hunter, but I didn't realize how much this lack of armor variety would truly kill the creativity, versatility, and build options.  Couple this with the fact that were are so few weapons (even if they are all pretty awesome), and the fact that we have four to five stat builds at most to use, and then you see how the game is super limited in variety, and the PvP plays very samey, even if you make one of each build (as I have).  Sure, there is a big differene between how BT plays vs arcane or quality, but still, even then, it can become fairly redundant.  


As for myself, I never realized how much I'd miss boss weapons and excessive weapons (even if a lot were samey, a lot of them were still unique) until I was sated on Bloodborne :/ 




 Yes - I've made several PvP characters as well, and to be able to complete the quests I want, get the items I want, and level what I want, it still only takes a few hours.  A little over two or three hours for the main game, and another two hours (probably a bit longer) for the chalices - which is really damn fast when you think about it, and it is super easy once you have the know-how, but that's the way it goes with all the souls games once you figure them out.  Of course, on my first play-through I took my time, and explored a lot and so forth, but even then, the game seemed surprisingly short, and being familiar with FROM's tropes and way of hiding things, BB just fealt supremely easier once I was accustomed to the mechanics.  It was even easier on subsequent playthroughs, and even the cursed mechanic isn't much of a bother anymore.  I'm sure a new player to FROM games would not agree though.


Of course, building new toons for PvP isn't as fast as a true speed-run, but it can still be done very fast, and depending on someone's play-time, it can be done in a few sessions, and even less if you don't bother to farm for the 27% and other top-tier gems, which aren't even necessary depending on the weapons you use, as you can still two to three shot a lot of people with the main game gems.


Here's hoping the DLC brings some much needed variety and multi-player options to the game :D 




 What bias?  I said this game is a master-piece, it's just severely limited in quite a few areas, especially one of the most important in any of FROM's game:  the multi-player.  

As for the difficulty, I suppose you didn't see the 'relative to other Souls game part (especially for people who aren't new to the series),' but then again, that has been the point in all these games.  Sure, they can still deliver an ass-whooping, but once you learn them, they become significantly easier.  As for my critique of this great game, I was dissapointed at how short and linear BB is, though the awesome level design hid that fact well.  From there, the multi-player system is stupid and clunky, the SRRC is terrible, PvP invasions are extremely limited and the health penalties are asinine.  The covenants are also lame as fuck.  I could go on, but that is a good place to stop.  Still a great game, I just wish they had more time to make it even better.

 Actually, compared to the other souls games, BB is pretty short and easy, and once you've run through it once, it is fairly easy to take a character through pretty much the entire game in an hour or two.  The chalices slow you down, but if you speed run those, you can still be done with them in short order.  A good defence of the changes FROM made to co-op, is simply to say, it's cool that they let friends and people have fun summoning each other, because I'd wager that just because someone can summon a high level into their game, a lot of new and low-level players won't be summoning high levels in to beat the cleric beast for them, simply because it takes premeditation, and not everyone plays these games in group or co-op at all.


Point is, this game is already easy and short and limited in every aspect that has made FROM games great: builds, variety, armor that is more than fashion, covenants, and a better multi-player experience for PvE and PvP.  It is a msterpiece to be sure, but fairly dissapointing in a lot of regards (not talking about the FROM hype either).  I am fine with them opening up the game a bit to let friends play with each other online easier.  Now, if they'd only fix a myriad of other fundamental problems with this game, like the SRRC, or covenants, or the stupid invasion system and its penalty... 




 I hate that stupid light on the controller.  It creates unnecessary glare, and it makes it harder to spook myself in the dark  




 Just did another 5 runs of pwmf22gu, and nothing more than 25% gems...

edit:  and a 6th one yielded a lvl19 27%.  Woohoo! 




 HookerFolio 




 Winnie like The Pooh?  Or whinny like a horse?  Or winning like Charlie Sheen? 




 Right, but even the higher % attack gems still give crap returns on the crap arcane stats on BB and BoM.  Those weapons are min-maxed with the +physical gem w/ flat arcane damage, and that is how you optimize those weapons' split damage.  What annoys me is it is still a lot more work to get usable gems for those weapons, than say, throwing in a few easy to aquire 20%+ physical gems in weapons like ludwig's or the chikage, and even worse is trying to get the best arcane gems :/ 




 I can see the wonder of it all now:  the static bell maidens summon maidens that then summon more maidens that summon spiders. You spawn into a chalice dungeon, and wonder why the floor is red and sparky, only to realize that the floors and walls and all the enemies are now made out of red spiders. You go to flick the lamp to escape, but the lamp was really a summoned red spider all along. YOU DIED.  




 BoM and BB aren't meant to get their best damage and best AR's off the arcane stat, as it scales like shit, and is built by that design.  The damage is split with the weird scaling because you min/max those weapons with the +phys damage gems with the +flat arcane damage gems, and that is how you get 600 AR+ on BB and BoM's. 




 150 means we wil have two or three builds, instead of four or five.  This game is already severely lacking in options, variety, and creativity when it comes to PvP, and as stream-lined and as fun as it could be, I think it is unnecessary.


Edit:  worth noting on the BoM discussion.  The BB and BoM weapons aren't meant to get their damage from Arcane stat scaling - they get their best damage off the +phys % with +flat arcane damage gems, as they both attack fast and can really dish out the numbers when gemed appropriately... 




 As others have said, Ludwig's Holy blade is sort of seen as the go-to newb weapon, as you can find it early in game, and it is easy to pump up the damage on it relatively quikcly.  I never even picked it up until my third or fourth character in, and I gotta admit, I see why it is the go-to weapon - it is extremly powerful, you can pick it up fairly early, it scales well with both STR and SKL for either type of build (or a more balanced quality build at like 35/35, but I prefer to specialize and pump at least one to 50), you can enchant it with papers, and it is easy to get that thing to 600+ AR, whereas other weapons involve a whole lot more gem farming (specially arcane, or the other SKL weapons with optimal gems) to really max out the potential AR. 


That being said, Ludwig's will be your go to when you really are having trouble with a boss, or want to sort of smash your way through everything.  For a bit more finesse, and to vary up your play-style to keep things interesting, if you do go for a SKL build, then you'd want blades of mercy, and my favorite, the burial blade.  There is also the cane, but I can't stand the weapon's AR, moveset, or anything about it (just my opinion though).  Again, Ludwig's is easy to fall back on, because to get the best AR and gems on the BoM and BB, you need an uncanny burial blade (triangle slot instead of waning), and you need to farm gems with %physical damage plus flat arcane damage (ie, +9% physical damage, +65 flat arcane damage).  These weapons have lower base AR's, but a little innate arcane damage, but they hit quick, so between the physical and the arcane, if you gem them right, you can easily have 300+ physical damage and 300+ arcane damage per hit.  That is a lot on the burial blade, and especially the blades of Mercy since they hit super quick :D


If you went STR, you are dealing with slower weapons (though even the slow weapons in this game are fairly fast).  You have the axe with decent AR, but it is the awesome, versatile, crowd-mangling 2hand moveset that really makes it shine.  There is the wheel, which is very... different, but I couldn't get into, no matter how hard I tried (worth checking out though).  The stakedriver is fun, and it definitely takes more finesse and timing than a lot of other weapons, and lacks reach, and finally, there is the hammer, which I wanted to like, but honestly, between a lot of the terrible camera angles, I often found my entire character, the enemies, and half the screen being blocked by the giagantic hammer that was slung over my shoulder, and I just couldn't play the game like that.  But with all that being said, it is definitely worth trying them out to see which ones you like best, and from there, you could try to see where you'd like to take your build.  There are a few other weapons I didn't mention, but the ones I mentioned are the most popular and versatile ones.


Worth noting, for a standard level 100-120 build for Co-Op and/or PvP, you want at least 40 vitality for health (especially due to co-op/invader -30% health handicap), 20 endurance (though I prefer 25, as 20 won't even give you every weapon's full 3 to 4 hit combo), and a primary damage stat at around 50.  Blood tinge should be ignored unless you are making a blood tinge build, and arcane should be at 15 if you want to use the hunter's tools, but no higher unless you are making a full arcane build.  Hope this helps.

Edit:  typos/clarity

Edit 2:  To be clear, I'm pretty sure you're right about LHB being top dog for damage.  Other weapons might have more versatile move-sets, be quicker, or be more engaging or challenging to use, but in terms of raw damage especially with being able to be enchanted, I'm pretty sure Ludwig's is the highest damage weapon in game. 




 Oh yes!  This one too! 




 Even with a B/B scaling in STR and SKL, supposedly Ludwig's Holy Blade gets slightly more AR out of STR than skill, so for a quality type build (which you already have), I'd leave either STR where it is, or SKL where it is, and max one of them up to 50 for your primary damage stat.  Personally, I prefer SKL weapons in this game (namely for a particular end of the game weapon), and SKL also increases the damage of your visceral attacks, so in general, I feel like SKL  STR in terms of general usefulness in BB, never mind the slightly slower attack speeds of a lot of STR weapons (though they still wreck).


That being said, my original toon was a STR build, and I had a lot of fun with it and really loved the hunter's axe, but my main toon for PvE/PvP is a 25 STR / 50 SKL /15 Arcane (for tools) SKL type quality build that is capped at level 110. 




 Cool.  So there is hope, huh?  I was mainly wondering if I was wasting time still looking to get lv 19 gems from said bosses, since I oddly didn't see one drop after an hour+ of farming last night, whereas, the night before I received several in quick succession.  Thanks for your input, and damn you RNJesus! 




 It's the ghost of Gwynn! 




 Yes yes yes.  And worthwhile PvP covenants, and an arena, and better conenctivity, and better summong/invading options period. 




 I know a lot of people tested this, but part of me thinks it was all in people's heads all along :P 




 As I said in an above reply, I don't have a large enough pool of accurate data, and RNG is stupid like this, but I found it odd that I received several 18 (or is it 19?) gems in a short time pre-patch, and post patch I didn't pick up a single 18 or 19 gems in a similar amount of boss kills.  Could have just been opposite RNG day.  Will try some more tonight.  Thanks for your input. 




 Yep...  wish they could have come up with better or different rewards for the chalices, and different ways of upgrading your weapon aside gems...  Also, I hate the sloppy way they are organized in my inventory, and I hate searching through a massive pool of gems :D 




 Yes.  Yes I did.  Editing it now.  Thank you :) 




 Yeah.  I just found it odd that after at least getting a few 27% gems fairly quickly pre-patch, I didn't even get one within a similar amount of time of farming post patch. 




 Yes!  After being sated with BB in such a short time, SOFS totally engaged and engrossed me, which I didn't expect it too, at least for PvE, but it did, and I had already played DaS2 vanilla/DLC to death in both PvE and PvP from last year.


 You'll notice a lot of different mechanics at play, more character stats and abilities to figure out, but the best thing is that the multiplayer is infinitely better than how slow and clunky the multiplayer in BB is, for both PvE and PvP :D


Edit:  As others have said, it is worth playing DaS as well, and DeS if you have a PS3.  

Edit (added more): Out of DaS1/2, DaS is the better souls game, but take the whole *DaS2 is the worst* opinion with a grain of salt, because it is still a great game and people love hyperbole.  In fact, DaS2 it is the best RPG with the best PvP in the series, it just isn't the best SOULS game in the series :) 




 So, the day before the patch I had farmed up quite a few 27% physical damage triangle and radial gems quick and easy from the popular chalice glyphs many people use (5pwujscd for triangle and pwmf22gu for radials), and I was pretty much swimming in 27% damage gems.  In fact, I don't think anything less than 27% even dropped.


Last night I ran quite a few boss kills on both those glyphs (mostly pwmf22gu though) for 27% gems one of my lower level PvP toons, and I didn't see a single 27% gem drop.  At most, I received a few 25% gems.  Now, I didn't go about it in the most scientific manner or track the drops well or anything, but has anyone else who keeps better tabs on these things noticed a change in the drop rates of blood gems?  Did they make the 27% gems more rare?  I plan on running some more tonight, but until then, has anyone had similar experiences?  Can anyone confirm or deny?  Is it just RNJesus magic?  Thanks in advance for your replies. :)

Edit:  had wrong triangle glyph listed. 




 Yes.  Yes I did.  Anyway.  Drop me a line sometime.  We should totally play some bloodborne. 




 Uhhh, did you miss the joke? I was saying you didn't belong here because you weren't acting like a bitchy, over-reactive, self-righteous, self-important, cynical and life-hating, reddit dick-head... 
























 Have yet to see anyone mention SJW's, particularly the young, entitled, bratty ones (wait, that's all of them) who pollute the internet and youtube and Tumblr, who clearly just finished their first woman's study and race relations class, yet totally lack in life experience and character and adversity (as they clearly don't understand that adversity and conflict shapes us and helps us grow), and it's all so totally obvious and cringe-worthy how ignorant and herd-like they are as they film their trite videos from their rich-ass parent's beautiful house.  Yeah... total assholes. 




 Dude, fuck me too! Did you know that if you layer wings for marie parts 1 and 2, A Perfect Circle's 13th Step, and Puscifer on top of Lateralus, and their upcoming album set to drop in 2051, it creates a super secret song?  Dude...  you just don't understand Maynard like I do. 




 Yes, I know you know because you have seen the other side.  Thank god we will come to once we have dissolved back into the mud!


Edit:  You sound like a first year philosophy student, but I could be wrong ;)  That being said, fuck those other 'same goops' who don't use their turn signals! 




 You sure you can do it without crossing over to the dark-side of douche baggery, projection, hypocricy, and moral superiority?  :D 




 Yeah, groups are just a social construct! 




 You park in two spaces most places you go, forgot that turn signals exist, and you drive around like you're the only dickhead on the road? 




 Yeah.  "Groups" are just a social construct, and they don't occur in nature or society...oh wait :D 




 That's total jody talk bro!  Just kidding.  I'm totally with you.  I totally respect the fuck our of our bloated military budget, and our massive war machinery (and I mean that, no sarcasm.  I'd rather it be someone else than us), but for the dudes who sign up for the job, keep that in mind - you are being paid to do a job, and whether you go overseas or not, you are not a goddamn martyr.  Let people respect you and your posititon for what they are - you don't have to rub it in their face in aggressive manners as if you are somehow better than the other worker bees around you. 




 Totally.  Those fuckers are so annoying :D 




 I'd tell you, but you've probably never heard of them anyway...

 Whoa.... 




 I'm sorry, but this is the only video on here I ever watched that made me laugh... it's just, so ridiculous  :( 




 Sad, for sure, but I'm still on the fence about kids dying being somehow worse or more sad than adults dying.  Adults actually have responsibilities, and often are more directly contributing to the world, and they often have families and earning potential and etc, or if they are geniuses, it really is a tragedy when they die, because they possibly had the power, ability, and intelligence to make positive changes in the world, whereas kids don't directly contribute to society, and they get to die not having to know how truly fucking terrifying yet mundane life on this god-forsaken rock can be (aside cases of extreme abuse, or examples where parents brutalize and then kill their kids, etc).  I mean, I know people are more emotionally affected by children's deaths, but beyond that, is there a solid reason/argument to truly back up that it is somehow more sad?  Sure, we can say they died before they could develop and live up to their potential, but I'd just counter that again with, "well, at least they got to die when life was still simple and fun."  Anyone care to try to sway me either way? 




 Uuuh, what the hell does that poor translation mean?  I am trying to understand what happened and is going on, but the flip flops behind that dude's mangled head is throwing me off... 




 Most of those assholes got exactly what they courted, but still, the way those bodies fly is goddamn freaky!

 Wheeeee! 




 Wait.  Why did the one person on the motorcycle crash into them?  And how did the cops even know what was going on?  There were no cops behind them as far as I could tell, so how did they decide to come up and just start shooting everybody? 




 I don't remember mentioning anything about the wheel and its scaling, but the last thing Ludwig's needs is to scale off of Arcane on top of STR and/or SKL, as Ludwig's is by far the easiest weapon to ramp up the damage and make OP, even with a lower quality build, and even with sub-par gems :D 




 Yeah, they become more challenging, and I actually personally enjoy the depth 4-5 story dungeons quite a bit, at least more than how boring and easy the first few dungeons are.  And occasionally I do really enjoy exploring some of the odd and more challenging randomly generated depth 5 dungeons :D 




 Bone in turkey leg? 




 I always think of him as "Game Of Thrones Louis CK"

In all seriousness though, heart-ache is some real shit.  Instead of trying to drink yourself silly, maybe you should let yourself feel the heart-ache, and process it, and deal with it, instead of trying to numb the pain and run away from it?  That shit takes time.  Three years isn't going to vanish in one night, or one week, or one month, and probably even a year or two, and a few gallons of vodka and a buncha boxes of doughnuts won't change that either.  Just keep in mind, she said that she wasn't in love with you, not that *you are unlovable* or *unworthy of other people's love,* just not her love.  People grow apart, people fall in and out of love, so the actual break-up often takes the other person by surprise, but it can and does happen, and nothing is forever, even if it is promised and especially if it is expected.  And in time, maybe you should see a therapist, or talk to some people you know and trust.  Wish ya the best.
 




 Seriously.  Who the fuck keeps tomatoes in a jar? 




 I though it was usually because the people who failed to merge and waited till the last minute were lazy and not paying attention and now fuck everybody else because they need to cut someone off... that's why I assume most people don't want to have some asshole cut them off at last minute (not to give OP a pass on his douche baggery). 




 VRUMMM VRUUUM!  Organ donor douche bag calling card!  :P

Just fuckin around.  Glad you're alright man, you sound like an alright dude.  Funny that a lot of people have that awareness/perception/opinion that Mustangs are the calling card of the douche bags, but I find BMW Drivers to be some of the shittiest, dumbest, most selfishly douchey motherfuckers out there on the road.... and there are endless droves of them here in California :( 




 fag no pert begs! 




 no pert beging u faget! 




 Is accomplishment the right word for it?  Gamers like to challenge themselves, and I know there are trophies and other odds and ends for whatever reasons, but I'm pretty sure most gamers don't pick up games (entertainment) just for the trophy aspect of it, and they don't set out consciously thinking, 'I am going to accomplish a lot in this game.' 




 Oh, I dodge bone marrow ash to be sure.  That shit hurts.  Now I just need to practice my *break-distance/circle strafe to the left with shield up* for all the rest of the gun spammers.  Sounds thrilling.  Thanks again :D 




 Love the monster theme dude.  Keep it up.  Would love to see what you put together in time.  And I also love how people are so quick to interject their asinine opinions when it comes to tattoos and what people should or shouldn't have done to their body.  I love seeing more original or different art work, as opposed to the same lame ass japanese koi/lotus/samarui/cheetah print/swallows/anchors/stars/skulls that every person with no imagination comes up with :D  




 Ha.  I still love all my work.  I loved them a lifetime ago when I got them, and I love them to this day. 




 What would you rather he collect?  What would make YOU happy, since this is about you and your opinion.  Maybe some birds, or a skull, or an anchor, or how about some stars?  Some stars would be really wicked cool and original.  Oh, I know.  He could get a koi fish, or some other lame ass shit that people get tatted with all the time.  Stop the douche-baggery. 




 Heya.  So in the meantime, just use the best damage gems you can find, but once you're in a place to farm the depth 5 root chalice gyphs, check out this guide (there are plenty of other good ones out there too):


http://www.reddit.com/r/bloodborne/comments/32gbr1/how_to_farm_the_best_blood_gems/


Just keep in mind you don't need to make chalice dungeons with your own materials for every dungeon you want to explore.  All you have to do is make a Fetid/Rotten/Cursed dungeon of one type (I always use the pthumeru ihyll root chalice, with all rites), and that will give you access to every chalice glyph out there.  Good hunting to you  o/

 




 What level are you?  And what are your stats so far(ie, 50 vit, 25 end, 50 SKL?)?  Also, do you plan on doing much co-op and PvP?  If so, you'd want to cap your blood level around 100-125 ( or even 150) for best results for match making. 




 Cool.  Didn't have time to PvP last night, but I tested it on some mobs.  Most shots seemed to take up half my endurance, and still do a chunk of damage to my health.  Offhand, do you know how much evelyn's typically do in terms of damage when you block?  Thanks.  I'll have time to test it in actual PvP tonight.   




 Not sure about the cane, as I am not a big fan of it myself. If it has a triangle slot, Then I'd say shoot for the best physical gems you can put into it (27% radials) and a 27% triangle. If it has a waning slot, the best you can put in is a bit lower, at like 23%ish, but apparently there are ultra rare +28% damage waning gems, but I and most other people I know have never found one in many hours of game play on many different characters.  




 It's still easy to find dedicated PvP in a number of places, but what we are missing is a no-health-penalty dueling sort bell or arena (among other things, like worthwhile covenants, a multi-player system that doesn't suck and take so long, etc). 


I was happy to see that they gave invaders (ie, griefing pve players) a run for their money in te base game pre patch 1.04, ie, stacking odds against the invader (as previous games often favored invaders, especially since they were built for PvP) but I was bummed that invasion areas are so limited


The level range thing is a stretch, but not everyone coordinates with passwords to summon super high level players,  and I am all for letting people have fun how they want to, but still :/ 




 For any and all root variations of F/R/C you only ever need to generate one yourself (so long as you have the prerequisite root chalices in your inventory), and that is to create a F\R\C\ pthumerian Ihyll root chalice. Once you create that one dungeon with all offerings using your own materials, you will then have access to all available chalice glyphs out there.


Don't waste your chalice materials making one dungeon for each glyph you want to try. Just create the one I mentioned, and enjoy :) 




 Sure.  Have you aleady cleared the main story line chalices and obtained all the root chalices and so forth?   




 Don't have the info off-hand at the moment, but there are a few fairly easy dungeons to farm for all the best or most of the best gems you could need or want, from the 27% physical gems to the +% phys and flat arcane gems.  Most involve repeatedly farming the first layer bosses, or one of the nearby enemies.  Will drop you a line later with more info and some links if you can't find it in the mean-time. 




 I know.  You can use any button (as opposed to old DaS methods of bumpers) in Bloodborne to lessen the damage and all that, but the grab, the attack, the hunter slumping to the ground, and the stand up animations take far too fucking long, for such a fast paced game.  It's not even exciting or frightening (like being chomped on by a mimic) or that damaging.  It's boring and it slows the action down to zero.  




 Yeah, those frame drops fucking suck, and her shrill screach makes me want to destroy my speakers and stick screw-drivers into my ear drums  




 Oh god!  They were so terrible and frightening and confusing to fight for the first time.  And their sack full of dead hookers stunk :c 




 Camera is a cheap ass!  They totally just copied/pasted him back from DeS!  Lazy FROM  




 Hate it when they slurp the insight out of my ass :c 




 Any enemy and their stupid twenty-two minute-long grab/attack animation, where my hunter then takes a nap, and is finally able to wake up and fight again.  Seriously, brain-suckers and their stupid-ass magic/grab spam can fuck off and die, and whoever created those enemies needs to be fired and commit soduko!  


Whenever my hunter is grabbed by a brain sucker or snake man or garden of eyes, I go outside for a smoke, take a dump, watch the news, make dinner, and then I usually get back just in time as the brainsucker is done sucking out my insight, and then my character lays down for a nap, and is ready to finally stand back up and continue the fight :D


Edit: worth noting, I don't think there are enough spider-summoning bell maidens in game, and they should always come in quadruplets.  Two isn't enough. 




 Yes.  Even with high skill, the BB has a low base physical damage (lower than saw spear and saw cleaver even at +10), but it attacks fast, and the 2h movesets don't take as much stamina as the other heavy weapons (ie, standard R1 = 28 on BB, vs 36 on LHB).  If you only buff the physical portion of the damage via gems, you are only buffing one portion of it's damage, and 27% (even x3) of its base damage isn't that much :D 




 Eh, it's hit and miss.  Sometimes I am doing the shredding, and other times they are doing the shredding.  There usually isn't much of a chance to back off and be defensive, as most fights can and do end in two or three quick R1's or a good follow up or quick combo, and even then, most people will just start shooting or throwing knives, so I've seldom found that to be of much use (at least in wider and more open areas). :D 




 Yes, the standard BoM has the best slots for this, two radials and a triangle. 




 I don't know why it's there, I was just mentioning how to best use what is there :D 




 The burial blade has one of the lowest base physical damage values at +10, lower than even the saw cleaver and the saw spear.  If you stick pure physical gems on it, you still won't get as much out of it as buffing both physical and arcane damage.  Plus, both the one hand and even the two handed versions of the weapon attack pretty damn fast, and don't use up as much stamina as other larger weapons, leaving you room for multiple combos and hits. 




 Yeah.  I like the unlocked BB, so maybe I need to get a handle on the unlocked LHB, but speaking of the 20 second meta, 27% gems might be a bit much... :P 




 I just responded to your other post.  Not sure if BB/BoM are meant for full arcane builds, as I'm pretty sure the arcane blood gem stones don't convert the damage of it properly or fully, no?  Also, the scaling with arcane is terrible (ie, the D in STR scaling on a +10 BB will give you more AR than the B in ARC).  Point is, if you try to just boost the physical, or just the arcane, you are gimping the weapon.  As they both hit fast and quick, and the best gems for them are the *+physical % with +flat arcane damage* as they boost both types of damage, and will raise your AR much higher than pure SKL, pure ARC, a split, or either pure phys or arc blood gems. 




 Nope.  You definiately don't need or want too much arcane (unless you want to use hunter's tools, or don't care about meta levels) for the BoM/BB, as the scaling from ARC is miniscule compared to how the split damage works as a whole.  You'll only get a few AR out of investing precious levels into arcane.  The pure physical gems are lacking for BoM/BB as well, because you are only increasing one side of the damage, which has a lower base value in the first place.  The gems you want are the ones that have both +physical % damage and +flat arcane damage.  That is how you get your BB to 650-750 AR, and your BoMs to 400-500 AR, but what sucks is, compared to other weapons that are easier to make OP early in the game, you'll need an Uncanny Burial Blade (for triangle slot), so don't waste your chunks/blood rocks on the regular BB if you can help it.  Also, you'll need to get access to the depth 5 cursed dungeons to get the best phys/flat arcane gems available in both radial and triangle form, and these are used for both the BoM and the Uncanny BB.  In the mean time, if you find that your weapons are too weak, you could always get a LHB, as it scales great with SKL and STR, and it is easy to raise the AR on it with a few decent gems, and it might outdamage what you are using now, but again, LHB like the BB is best in its uncanny version for the triangle slot.  Hope this helps!



Edit:  IIRC, you can at least get some +7-8%/ +30-35 flat arcane damage gems somewhere in the chalices or main game (to tide you over until you can get the 8-9%/+60-70 gems), but I don't remember where they came from :/ 




 Probably the whole DaS *"shit we ran out of development time, so just copy/pastra capra and taurus demons and we'll make due"* sort of things :/ 




 Totally.  If I want to randomly genocide a whole city/town/area, I should be able to, and to hell with whoever is trying to fend me, the foreign invader, off :D 




 Pretty much the same as DaS.  Dude handed us his vague ass quest (though he subtly hinted about 'keeping the torch lit'), and then the chosen undead turns total asshole, killing everything that was content to sit there and drool for eternity until we came along and killed it. 




 LOL 




 Perception is not synonymous with IQ.  Schizophrenic people of all ranges of intelligence see all sorts of things we can't see, after all.


Emotional intelligence is not synonymous with IQ either.


I mean, there are many facets to intelligence, so it depends.  And no, I don't mean this from the angle of "street smarts vs. book smarts," as I've known too many 'street smart' people who just used it as an excuse for their stupidity.  Sure, there can be some truth there, but mostly I've seen dumb people use it to rationalize their own ineptness ;) 




 I enjoyed the main story line areas for the most part.  I think the chalices could have been better designed, as slogging through them felt boring and uninspired at times :/ 




 Don't worry, the challenge will ramp up soon enough :D


But I agree.  Going through the first few chalices (as I did on my first toon) at a higher level is boring as shit 




 Ah. I forgot about the shield. How much endurance does it take to block bullets from say Evelyn, or a shotgun like the blunderbuss or Ludwig's rifle? 




 To be clear, i am talking strictly PvP. That being said, i dont think ive encountered anyone in the reddit dungeon who doesnt have high or the highest level gems, hence the 2-3 shot meta, and smaller weapons can sill be 3 shot metas easily, but most transformed weapons with the higher gems can kill in two or three shots at the 100-120 meta, and I use it and encounter in almost every PvP match. But hzngr is mostly chikevlyn builds in my experience, so I find myself playing more in nightmare frontier. 


In terms of rounding out the builds that exist, I am fine with that, as a few more AR even on quality weapons will still kill you in the same number of hits. There will be no difference in a 400 vs 500 hubter's axe killing you in 3 hits, or a 700 vs 800 LHB killing you in 2 hits, or a 500 vs 600 chikage killing you in 2 hits (after they've spammed a clip of bullets at you), but at higher levels, you at least have more defence, hopefully more vitality, and all around more EHP. 


Now couple that beyond the souls game mind-set for PvP, and lets have some matches that last longer than the wait period in between them, and what we are really missing is dueling bells or an arena or some way to get rid of the stupid debuff for dedicated PvP fights (vs griefing hosts, which I am fine that the invader can be at a disadvantage).  




 You're still missing the cool sound effects, and I still enjoy the BB (unlocked) ;)
(Though to be fair, I haven't used LHB much in PvP, and I wonder if it would be a good counter to chikage?)


And for every 10 Chikevelyn users I see, I see 0 LHB users.  I think I've seen more wheel users, which are rare enough as is, than LHB :( 


edit:  unlocked BB* 




 I still prefer unlocked BB ;)

(Though to be fair, I haven't used LHB much in PvP)


And for every 10 Chikevelyn users I see, I see 0 LHB users :(

 Yes, but the equivelant of havel-butt-mage is bullet spam, and some people would rather spam all their bullets away than play the game.  That shit gets old, and it really is the magic spam of this game.  Rarely do I have the patience to wait it out, and that's on me.  Sure, it's a valid way to play the game in the way you want, I just think it's cheesy and boring as fuck -_-


That being said, while I think the PvP is fun in this game, it is also lacking and a step backwards imo, and the 20 second/2-shot meta (between the 2 minute waiting times) kinda sucks.  Gonna back up my toons soon and try the 150 meta for a bit :D 




 But it's a given that LHB is easy to make OP :P  With the damage you listed, I'm guessing that's around 50/50?  Or 50/30? or 40/40?  Or some higher end quality build?  But what the BB lacks in ridiculous damage (as LHB takes the cake in all buikds/fields), it makes up for in finesse and style and cool sound effects. ;)


Also worth noting, as strong as it is for PvE, I hardly see LHB in PvP  




 Scummiest setup? There are like, four or five builds in this game, but I really do hate people who spam shotguns from max range, effectively rooting themselves and flinching me...for no reason, and I do hate eveylyn spammers too, but I digress :P


Honestly,  between the limited weapon options and lack of builds, I don't find this game's gestures to be as insulting as previous games, and with our 20 second/2-3 shot PvP meta, it's hard for me to take this game's PvP as seriously (Fighting super tryhard havel/butthole/jester/assclowns duel wielding katanas shooting crystal soul spears who then do a /mock gesture is a whole different story). 


The other night I was in hizngr and I fought this one chikevelyn guy (most of them usually are), but he was good, and I just couldn't get him, and he'd always kill me in two transformed hits, with or without a few bullet holes.  I nearly got him once, but by the third time I was matched with him again, I couldn't hlep but laugh and do the whole "spare me gesture" thing.  He didn't, and I died again in another two transformed chikage hits.  What can you do?  (/mock myself) 




 Well, I've seen a  lot of people gem and build for the Burial Blade wrong (the hybrid arcane weapons seem to confuse people a lot), so in this case, I mean the correct gems, more than 'the best' gems. 




 Well, it's not OP as easily putting three 27% gems on a chikage or a LHB, but the BB has a bit more style and finesse, and the problem is I've seen a lot of people who don't know how to gem (and build) for it, as the hybrid arcane weapons seem to confuse people a lot :P 




 It's not that the Burial Blade is 'stronger' per se, it just depends on your build and if you are using the correct gems (with the uncanny BB), and it won't be over-powered for you because you will be missing the best-in-slot gems, and you'll be a long way off from being able to farm for them (until you run all the chalices or dreg through a lot of SRRC bullshit for multiple dungeons), so don't sweat it :) 




 If you gem it right you can get 650-700 AR, so not really :D 




 Oh, I agree.  I like playing the build in PvE because it plays quite different than the other builds (nothing to do with it being a katana, I just think this game lacks variety), but I agree with you on the other parts.  The build is very restrictive, the bullet spam is obnoxious and cheesy in PvP, and I wish FROM had at least another BT scaling/powered melee weapon or two, so the BT build wouldn't just be the Chikage/evelyn build.  It's also annoying to not be able to just keep your weapon transformed :D 




 Right.  While I don't want to necessary encourage bullet spam (seriously, fuck off shotgun and eve spammers and play the game :D), vials serve a multititude of roles, and I don't know about you, but I don't find the 20 second/2-3 shot meta all that engaging or exciting.  I like knowing that my opponent and I are free to go all out against each other, and a longer battle has always yielded more satisfaction, as it usually ends due to me catching the opponent with better strategy or skill or wearing him out, rather than a few lucky, laggy, or quick hits.  That's not the best way to put it, and it's sort of hard to describe the difference at the moment, but the 2-3 shot meta is so quick and short, it often feels like the fight is over before it even begins... 




 Ok, I think you missed the point or misunderstood some important things here, so please let me try again :)


Movesets:  Yes, mindlessly spamming anything will get you punished, but I'm not talking about a non-stop R1 spam, rather, quicker attacks in general.  After months of PvP, I hardly see anyone use slow attacks, or charge attacks, because they are just too slow in such a fast paced game.  I hardly see anyone use them in the dozens of PvP videos posted here every week as well.  I'm not saying they aren't used, but they are rarely used, and for good reason:  they are just too easy to punish, and just too slow in a game like bloodborne's PvP.


The DaS Reference -  I don't think you misunderstood me.  That's the point of it.  It's not about judging the game, it's about how the PvP is way different, yet people pretend the stats in BB are the same as stats were in previous souls titles and hold the same weight (ie, this whole argument).  We can't pretend the PvP in this game is the same as the souls titles (with the random meta and stats), and thus, treat it the same


Stats/Sacrafice - Again, this has everything to do with why I am asking people to stop treating this game's PvP and builds the same as FROM's previous titles, because in the past, again, sacrafice was important and thus relevant, but the gains in damage from stats are so minor at present (due to the gems), that the arguments for a lower meta wind up sounding ridiculous, and there is no real reson for it.  So you bump up the meta another 20-25 (or even 50) levels from the present, and even in a damage stat, another 50-200 AR doesn't mean shit (probably not even that much) when we already have a 2-3 shot PvP meta.  If anything, you will have a higher defence, and more HP, so now maybe we can give the PvP in this game the 'something more' that is missing.  At present, most PvP fights feel like a premature ejaculation of blood, as before the fight can even get really interesting, one of us is dead already, and it's even worse if your opponent has a shitty connection.


So you, and every other stubborn person can continue to say *"but if I have a lot of two stats, it will somehow ruin PvP and make my character a jack of all trades",* and I will continue to say *bullshit,* because stats aren't the problem in this game, gems are, and the 20 second/2-3 shot meta of PvP is a fucking joke anyhow.  How could you ruin that?  How can you make yourself any more overpowered than we already are?  It winds up being boring, and what we are missing is more defence and more HP to make these matches more exciting, because I'd rather the matches last longer than the long waiting period in between them.


Going deeper with it: opening up more weapon options on a toon is fun, and the fact that we only have five builds (with a 75-120 meta) and a handful of weapons in this game does not make for the most dynamic PvP, so if you have more options on any character, I see that as a good thing (and this is coming from someone who has around 7 or 8 toons with 4 or 5 different builds each, most of which who have run through all the chalices and are fit for PvP).


Again, this became redundant awhile ago, but the arguments for the arbitrary lower meta are sounding more and more ridiculous, stubborn, and dated to me, and other than arguments that were relevant to past SOULS games, I think they have no place in Bloodborne. 




 Great. So we want to turn the 30 second/2-3 shot meta into the 20 second/one-shot meta? :P 




 Cool. Glad I could help.  Like I and others have said, just don't expect a prequel to bloodborne. The combat is still floaty, yet tight and weighty. Definitely worth your entertainment dollar value either way. Let us know what you think :) 




  I'm pretty sure everyone understood my sarcasm and humor there, hence the polite and humorous comments and upvotes ;) 




 Salmon Odors? 




 LOL. Hey it's me, the other guy. My post was more akin to satire - just google any old weird and random shit on the internet and it probably exists.  Dont look too far into it or consider it too creepy, as I'm not the weirdo dressing up and playing hunter-doll fantasies. :D


Edit:  the point is, stop being such a pervert ;) 




 You sure it's not soggy original? 0_o 




 I just beat the hell out of them, alternating between killing the most aggressive nippon steel asshole first (as he is super easy to parry-visceral), then I kill candle boy, and I leave flame faggot for last because you can get right in his face and bash his shadows in, while his fireballs sail right over your head.  Also, don't let them do their snake dance and summon the Giant Katana boas - you can interupt this attack, so if you see them going for the snake-geyser ritual, slap the shit out of them.

Also, you could always use a Shaman bone blade :P 




 BloodPorn!  I dig it!  Next game for the franchise! 




 I hated the cane, not because the damage seemed weak, but the moveset itself just felt so clumsy and floppy and lacked a good impact, like the slice of the cleaver or the heft of the axe. :D 




 Eh, As a long time soul player, I had a similar experience myself.  The game fealt very easy, aside a few spots in the main story line where the difficulty seemingly ramped up quite a bit, but once I got past that, it was back to smooth sailing again.  But that being said, don't get too complacent, as I feel there are definately a few areas that will kick even a familiar player's ass, but now that I look back, I still feel like it was a very linear and relatively quick and easy game :/ 




 There are only two:  Chikage and Evelyn.  One of the most fun builds to play, but one of the "cheesier" and more obnoxious builds to fight against in PvP.  Just dodge all the bullet spams, play it safely until they run out of bullets (like arcane spam in DaS), then go in for the attacks, or if you're like me, lose patience and run in between all the bullets towards your foe and then be 2 shot by a transformed Chikage :D 




 Go to nightmare.  You'll see more than Chikevelyns and shot-gun spammers :P 




 pew.  pew.  pew.  pew. pew...

Even more annoying, the shotgun users:

bang.  bang.  bang.  bang....

Ok, you're rooted in place, and I got a piece of buck-shot in my groin that staggers me for a second, but where is this getting us?  Can we play the game now? 




 This post may contain spoilers?  How about the title :D 




 Haha.  This made me LOL.  Thanks :D 




 Eh, they could have just had the messengers ring the bells for you in place, that would function just like a summon sign, but with BB aesthethics.  Honestly, the bells are clunky and annoying as shit, and as much as I love co-op, I hate the resonant bell because it gets old having to play hide and seek with the host everytime I spawn in on the other side of their map.  I don't find that to be enjoyable, and it doesn't contribute to my immersion.  I love PvP and the sinister bell is about the easiest to use in the PvP areas, but it is still slow, and the summoning/invading times for PvP are almost always longer than the matches themselves :/ 




 I hate it.  It is clunky, ineffective, and a waste of resources (as it uses insight right away).  Worth noting, I've only ever used the beckoning bell once or twice for the hell of it, and I use the small resonant bell and the sinister bell a lot.   


They should have just converted the summon/dueling signs into messenger bells, where, instead of writing your sign on the ground, your messengers sit there ringing the bells for you, but they operate the same exact way the summon signs did, that way they could have kept the effectiveness of the summon signs, and stayed true to the aesthethic of Bloodborne.


I remember seeing an interview or features list just prior to release (from a credible source) mentioning bell maidens and seamless multiplayer...seamless my ass, this has been the clunkiest, most obnoxious multiplayer to date.  Also, the resonant bells are annoying as hell, as I hate playing hide and seek with the host when I spawn in his world on the other side of the map 


Edit:  Forgot to mention that the SRRC was a good idea, but it is a total piece of shit as well :/ 




 Yes, Bloodborne is a master-piece to be sure, but even then, the PvE story line is short, linear, and fairly easy, though the awesome level design hides that fact pretty well :/
