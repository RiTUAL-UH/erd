 Obviously we will deal with the aftermath of last season but the producers have said that season 1 was mapped out to much fewer episodes as that's what was given meaning the rest of the season was padded out

So they say that season 2 will arc the entire run meaning it will be less panicked and cobbled together so am hoping for a more cohesive storyline with various arcs and can we get the Court of Owls please?

It would drive the whole thing for me not just this season but following ones as well, they're the puppet masters who will eventually reveal the killers of Bruce's parents  




 It was Mark Snow who created the original theme so hope he gets a nod in the new limited run, he also did the theme for Millennium...

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Snow 




 Here's my take on his entrance in season 2

He wonders in to Falcone's house during the episode maybe at the end of the first one, he looks around an empty house with a bemused look on his face then he enters Falcone's office with the chair facing the wall

Then all of a sudden, the chair swings around like Blofeld in James Bond, it is Penguin

Zsasz thinks WTF then Penguin grins and begins a sombre laugh

Episode ends

Then next episode, Victor decides not to work for Penguin and goes solo, meaning him against Penguin and Gotham, holy moly 




 She should put too much pepper in a pot or something with her name being Pepper and how about those plants huh, could we see her mixing some herbs or making potions at some point? 




 I think Cat is the most obvious as she basically resembles her future character already but we need more Ivy action, she is more intriguing to me 




 Would be a great little nod to the Adam West series if they put an old rotary bright red telephone somewhere preferably in Wayne Manor

It wouldn't need to be anything cheesy it could be in Bruce's bedroom somewhere as the camera pans across or amongst his possessions 




 Yeah and him tossing his coin, very homage 




 Yeah like spike someone's food with poison ivy 




 We need an extensive archive of all the little Easter Eggs littered throughout the season, I for one have seen multiple bats on buildings and in smoke and obviously in the pilot with Wayne's parents on the floor shaped as a bat, then there's the leaf when Bruce fell down the hill

The Riddler ? on the cup was the most blatant one and there's the Killer Croc reference when Bruce was sketching in the book

Then the collage of Arkham that Pengy did had the speech bubble saying oink 




 Yeah but less Cat and more Pepper 




 We really need the original intro, titles and theme for the limited run if it is ever going to be worth watching, some half assed modern version will not cut the mustard with fans

We need this...

 I sure hope they give her far more screen time next season as she has barely been noticeable in the first season and the young actress Clare Foley is a great choice, very creepy but strangely alluring for a kid but largely under utilised

We need to see her pull more pranks and see her back story with her parents and what she gets up to, Ivy has just as much influence in the Batman universe as Cat but it seems Cat has gotten all the attention in season one 
























 These are the albums that got me in to dance music, the mixed ones in particular were generally some of the best ever released especially the first 5-10 which were the pinnacle golden age but in latter years they went down hill a bit and went too commercial and the mixed era died along with the brand, it still lives on but only to make Ministry of Sound money, the craft and care of the originals were something special and touched your mind, body and soul, the highest state of euphoria

These are about the best euphoric ones they ever released...

 From the season 3 finale, next season could we see Ferguson finally be convicted of attempted murder and with the net closed around her, could we see her behind bars and to make an example of her, could she be put in Wentworth?

Would be great to see her dropped down a peg or two and see her roughed up a bit with Vinegar Tits the new governor or would we need another season to finally see this happen? 




 I wonder if Jim will grow a pot belly 




 I wonder if we may see Vicki Vale who Kim Basinger portrayed at some point, a recurring reporter character would play well especially if she was feisty and snooped around a lot  




 Check out these guys, they are UK based so would serve that area but seeing as the season has done, it no longer matters that there was a massive delay in broadcasting between countries...

http://gothamtvpodcast.com/ 




 Well, we have had a lot of Fish and Cat and not a lot of Ivy, poor Pepper and then there's Leslie and Montoya then there's Barbara who has been a mess all season, what were the writers thinking and then there's Victor's mistresses, Penguin's mum and various fleeting characters like Robin's mother and that's about it

Outweigh this with multiple sausages and testosterone fuelled nonsense, can we have more totty in season 2 please?

I see the writers may be having more diverse characters in season 2 so hopefully there may be a few welcome surprises in the way of sultry butt wiggling beauties 




 Bad Photoshopping 




 No pics, this is a scam 




 Yeah and Jim as the guy from The OC 




 Also, will the kids grow in to their roles as it's important to consider actor changes as well and if that will alter the show, I think the casting has been spot on and if anyone changes Riddle Man or Pengy for another actor there will be hell to pay 




 So long as she stays away from fetish whips till she gets older 




 Yeah David deserves a shot when he gets older but consistency is the key here, not every season has to be great but so long as it keeps going and the characters remain entertaining then why not 
























 I wonder if the FBI wallets and badges will be updated with up to date photos or will Mulder and Scully use the ones they did on the original intro, I would love a copy or two 




 So we getting CSI meets paranormal then 




 Yeah but comics go where no episodes can but I wonder how this will be filmed, probably in HD so will look great but hope it's still on film and does not look too stale, the great thing about the series is it had a certain look to it, light and dark, funny and sombre, it had it all 




 Yeah and it's not just Wikileaks but films like Loose Change, Zeitgeist and everything in between, but 6 episodes is limiting and it would only scratch the surface depending how the writers have done it

I wonder if the new comic book series will influence the episodes? 




 I get a cold war feel when viewing some older episodes especially the one with the submarine

When Mulder ran around outside it was so dark and foggy and very unnerving

The tension of the set pieces and the music really added depth to average scenes

Really hope the new mini series adds very post 9/11 and interconnected paranoia to the series as I know it's only six episodes but they all need to have a powerful message of current states of affairs 




 Would be great to have a section dedicated to vintage DJ sets that were spun on vinyl

Here's a stunning set from Paul van Dyk at Mayday in 2000

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcokiSnd5vs 




 Yeah his mix from Smack My Bitch Up into Adagio For Strings is very creative, the album was great yeah but it was more a laid back album instead of the driving euphoric stuff 




 Yeah they were all commercial but not always the way that MOS went with Trance Nation and the like even though original Trance Nation by Ferry Corsten was sublime 




 I wonder if this does happen, where else is there left to go, I think since her introduction in season 2, the show has gone to another level 




 Wasn't The Freak put in jail in the original Cell Block H, I know she had lots of fights with Queen Bee 




 I have scoured Discogs and am certain my list is correct, I have looked at all the vinyl and cassettes listed on there and only find his name on the ones listed above so chose various for the others but I may be wrong 




 Well, my first introduction was in the early 2000s and went to Blessed at The Republic around 2002 then Gatecrasher Resident Transmission event around 2003 so have been clubbing ever since

These albums are the best they ever made, forget the cross commercial nonsense they did after the numerous classics fodder...

 Poor Ivy Pepper, she will have to play with her plants again tut tut 




 Ah whatever, Couch Tuner again then 




 Also, where the heck is Ivy, are they ignoring her for another season, she needs screen time god dam it 




 Not keen on the likenesses here, it seems that someone forgot the photos and went by memory 




 Imagine not getting let in somewhere then flashing an FBI badge 




 Fox won't allow UK residents to view their site 




 Will the new mini series be shown on terrestrial TV or Sky / cable in the UK

The original series had aired on BBC / Sky 1 but what about the new series? 




 I sure hope they remove that stupid delay between the US showing episodes months before the UK receives them, you'd think nowadays that most countries would get things around the same time

Also, when will season 2 air in the UK ??? 




 I feel The Riddler should be on even level with Pengy in season two but they're still showing him as secondary  




 I know this was sung briefly in the cell by the old woman in an episode in the first series but I wonder if the full "I used to give her roses" will feature on an episode soon

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TC38KlmnSo

Maybe in the final season finale it has to be played over the last scenes, they need to do a homage when the final season ends and the prisoners all go on to pastures new

It would need to be Lynne Hamilton credited in the last episode as that song is probably more remembered than any of the Cell Block H characters 




 Would be great to have a few cameos from those who were in Cell Block H

They should have Ray Meagher (Alf Stewart / Home   Away) back as he was in the original as Geoff Butler / Ernest Craven / Kurt Renner 




 Gordon looks bloodied, you think he would have taken Falcone's offer and had a vacation by now, maybe Bullock finally had enough of him lol 
























 WTF is up with Lee's neck? 









 Well, will wee be seeing Riddler's bowler hat or Penguin's top hat any time soon

Also, Cat is basically like her future self but more leather needed

Ivy who I adore wears a Freddy Krueger style jumper, maybe latex will be her thing when she gets older

Not talking about Batman yet but maybe the final scene in season two will have him fall down the well to be surrounded by bats, that would be a fitting end to season two 




 They need to use less sex but more quirks, if she has some odd habits would be entertaining, maybe she goes off drink and pursues a few interests, it would be good to see her in public places doing normal things and having opinions, we need some dynamics now and less lesbian coke scenes 




 Well done lad and well said 




 Is it just me or did she kind of enjoy pummelling Barbara's head on the floor

I think also in scenes especially the Jerome episode, she did seem a bit snappy

So it's my guess that maybe she will turn bad while Barbara will turn good

She does seem secretive so will have some skeletons in the closet am sure

We have all seen Barbara's so maybe when Leslie turns sour, Babs could have redemption

I think it would be good for Babs that Leslie may do something damaging for Gordon and Babs picks up on it and does something heroic to save Gordon which could either be the making / breaking of Babs

Leslie on the other hand could have been anything before working in Arkham but nothing was said about her past, I think she will show her true colours soon, hopefully 




 Can anyone get any cuter than her, she's a perfect little puddy tat 




 Any local services that can reverse a fridge freezer door please? 




 This site doesn't show GIFs, what a bummer  




 There has been a pitch cam for months but now is the time we filmed the new scoreboard installation, we need setting up, retuning, collaborating settings and finally a Blu-ray 




 Come on guys, let's have an epic display of GIFs till the files are reopended lol 




 Come on guys, let's have an epic display of GIFs till season two arrives lol 
























 Yeah she was a sex siren who screamed like one 




 Are there any plans confirmed for the area front facing the taxis

The bit of land in front between the car park and the fountain path

Heard there was plans for this as well as the old Nelson Mandela site

They need to have a Sheffield store / gift shops and a few restaurants 




 So many epic lines in this scenes, never rub another man's rhubarb 









 Yeah agree, it seemed very rushed and the panel all seemed on edge

Sometimes these organisers should give set times for these things

Like at least 50 minutes per show / panel to have 20 minutes talk then the rest questions 




 Well, Mulder and Scully finally got together in the second film so will that play differently now we have six new episodes to view soon?

One of the things that drived the series was the sexual tension / chemistry between them, the will it or won't it happen every week, it's what kept us coming back for more

So with this no longer an issue, will there still be a spark between them that will produce great scenes, maybe they could add more humour to compensate like a lover's tiff kind of banter between them, that would be entertaining 




 Yeah me too but it's an odd character to get behind anyway, think early in the season she should have had interests to follow, I heard she was an attorney or something

It would be great if she pursued some job like that and stirs things up in GCPD for Gordon then at night the claws come out and she has an alternate life 




 Going on the recent Comic Con panel, I get the impression that she feels like a black sheep on there, not getting any notice and given garbage material to work with

Bruno Heller and the writers not giving her any real respect and other actors all getting the star treatment, I feel really bad for the actress

She can obviously act and am sure given enough scenes she would shine, she is a lot more interesting than Morena Baccarin in a non ego kind of way, like more open and willing to speak to people

She should be given more meat to chew on, more things to grasp, it seems the writers are embarrassed how they have written her into a corner and seemed like they made a mistake with her at the beginning and are wishing the character away so are choosing an easy way out by making her psychotic 




 Come on Riddler, put more effort in FFS 




 Was that Jerome at the end, WTF ??? 




 Do we have a full version? 




 Batboy stay away from Penguin !!! 
























 When will these be available as would prefer a straight clean install on multiple machines instead of upgrading ??? 




 Are these things made in a studio or wind tunnel? 









 The Freak's days are numbered, I'd love it if she was sent down for attempted murder, destination Wentworth and let the sparks fly 




 Bee as The Freak, mind blown 




 Which direction will the new episodes take then, will they go straight paranormal as that always worked, will it all be aliens, how about some spooky episodes with horror thrown in, will it be from canon or will it be new ideas, there has to be some bridging from the last films / series but instead of getting bogged down I think it's best to kind of forget some past events and tell new stories, that way it's not getting drawn back too much and will let the new stories shine 




 Describe the characters in one word only...

Bruce = brooding / Gordon = liability / Bullock = grouchy / Alfred = fastidious / Nygma = riddles / Penguin = waddles / Ivy Pepper = prunes / Selena Kyle = climbs / Harvey Dent = flips / Fish Mooney = swims 




 It means fucked, screwed, done over 




 Nygma riddles, Penguin waddles, Bullock curses, Jim chases, Barbara exhales, Leslie dissects, Ivy prunes, Cat climbs, Alfred tuts, Bruce broods 




 And not forgetting throwing pencils at ceilings 




 Gillian loves knobs 




 It seems he has a murky past, a dead end job, no missus and now Gordan taking the limelight

I wonder where Bullock is going, will he stay canon or will they throw in a newbie to complete him

Gordon has all the luck, drive and women just falling at his feet, Bullock is most definitely bollocksed 
























 Right, back in the day say the 90s, it really was a boom in paranormal on TV

I'm from the UK so the best we had was Strange But True, check out this archive...

https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7D63E9D27340FF44

Then the US had various shows from Sightings to Unsolved Mysteries with Robert Stack

There were other themed shows like Outer Limits but not factual reconstruction TV shows

I would love to see the complete Robert Stack Unsolved Mysteries episodes but you can't stream any online thanks to the guys that own the modern inferior version hosted by Dennis Farina which changed the theme tune and gave it a very boring studio feel with non of the charm Robert Stack gave 




 Hey it's the off season so random stuff allowed

Will season 2 come around already, it's forever 




 Bruce Lee should have played some sort of super hero and had his own show

Instead he was sidekick to some douche and had to fight an inferior Burt Ward

Rumour is he didn't want to lose so they made him and Robin tie, way to go lol

Bruce would have kicked the hell out of Batman and the rest of the cast for sure

Bruce used martial arts to beat his opponents, Batman uses those wonderful toys 














 I am still on Windows 7 so am awaiting 10 very soon but will WMP be available in Win10 as know Microsoft have killed Media Centre so what of Media Player?

Seen they're having standalone apps for these tasks so is there a need for WMP, I have used it for years to transfer files to music device but version 12 hadn't really changed from XP and still had outdated options, codecs and functionality, it could have been so much more 

They should have merged Media Centre with WMP and tied in massive downloads services like iTunes, think then Microsoft would've stayed relevant instead of getting lagged behind for many years  




 Is that Windows Media Player? 




 Can anyone list the available file formats Windows 10 will support when released?

I mean various formats from codecs / audio / video / image / office / PDF / zip files

Heard 10 will offer wider audio and video format playback as well as image viewing 




 Also, after the year, a physical version will still work while downloading after the year will be a paid upgrade so having a few physical copies dotted around is a good fail safe plus installing from physical media is a lot quicker than having to download the thing which could take overnight for some people 




 Not everyone has reliable internet connections so those without would be great to install the latest version without the hassle of outdated computers not being able to upgrade

 Then there's villians being killed off too soon like Scarecrow's dad and The Ogre, they should have been characters in the background causing mischief instead of being killed off so soon, they would have been great season villians in the shadows

Then there's The Flying Graysons, why only one episode and have their dispute resolved in one episode, they should have still had their dispute but come back in season 2 having resolved issues, then at least we would have believed it and it would be a great motif every season to have them return for a few episodes

Then there's Arkham, the whole Arkham promise has not been lived up to and should have been given far more attention, Gordon should have had a part time role in there for half the season then we would have gotten lots of little side stories featuring the odd villian we all know and would have been the great place to throw in Easter Eggs like colours / sounds / symbols / costume nods, it would have been a real treat for fans know this week they may get some little nods to the Batman universe 




 I would also say that whole Fish storyline on the island was pointless

She should have gone underground in the city then we would have had many useful episodes with her amassing her recruits and indeed luring Selena along, Ivy would have been included as well am sure or would have been on hand and picking up tips for her future self, maybe a young Harley would have been around as well

All this would have laid great groundwork for future younger villains but instead they put her on that god awful island which was a totally pointless plot device and detracted from everything else 




 I know they only planned for fewer episodes in season 1 so had to pad out the season which made for odd stories and was very hard to follow in places 

The show runners have said that they will arc the entire second season with multiple mini arcs, meaning we should have a far more coherent package  




 I'd disagree, the first season was hard to follow 

Season 2 will be a far more coherent package  




 Figured it may be a good idea to change the intro mood every season 

Like first few seasons it starts dark then gradually gets lighter over time 

Like the fonts and visual styles adapting to the season's main story arcs

Even the music themes could change from brooding Bruce to lighter Batman 




 Okey dokey ladies and gentlemen

What's in store for Riddle Man then?

From multiple personalities to what next

I'd love it if he went on a sadistic spree under the radar for an entire season

Be good to have him conflicting himself, like someone self imploding every second

Like self doubting his own motives, his every move, the truest form of insanity

This would be an epic descent in to the world he becomes but what of Ms Kringle

Maybe she will be the ultimate catalyst for his ascension to the dark side, she's such a cock blocker lol

If she carries on teasing and messing with his head, you'd not blame him for ultimately slaughtering her 




 Wow, looks like Selena will have her lethal little cat claws out soon lol 




 Well, season 3 has just ended and now a teaser for season 4

Are they shooting back to back seasons now with no breaks? 




 RIP Robert Stack, you are still missed and a class act till the very end

His voice alone gave us chills, he really brought reconstructions to life 




 When will this be available in the UK, will these be available at my local electronics store? 




 Oh god, does this mean she is busted or is this made up? 




 Yikes not much of Mulder but Scully is always very fine x
