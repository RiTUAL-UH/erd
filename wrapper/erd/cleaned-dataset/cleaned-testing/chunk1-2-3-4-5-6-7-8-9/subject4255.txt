 Hey everyone, instead of *just* downvoting a post could you please add a comment as to why? Maybe it's not that healthy, maybe it's not that cheap. Give us some context! Only you can improve quality and that starts with not just a downvote, but a reason as well. I'd like to know how to improve the subreddit.

 Hello,

I just switched from an iPhone 4 to an iPhone 5 a couple of days ago. I've been having issues logging into the app. I have cleared the login sharing and cache, deleted my account and then re added it with no luck. I've even tried uninstalling then reinstalling the app. Any ideas?

 So I bought a couple of bags of fresh cranberries at the market yesterday. I get home, pop some in my mouth and almost hurled at the taste of the wretched things. They were so tart! I had no idea! 

Anyhow, I want to make something healthy with them (low in carbs) and was looking for some recipes. 

Thank you in advance. 




 Everytime I buy a certain cheese flavored chip, I am always curious as to the addition of MSG. I know it's supposed to make food taste better but I've never had that chip without it. 

Same goes for any product you've tried that was MSG free.  














 Look, I've tried donotcall.gov, I've tried being nice and telling them to please remove my number from their list. But they're adapting... Like this:

I'll get calls from numbers all over the country, when I pick up they hang up on me. I would ignore them but if I don't pick up they'll call me 4-5 times a day. Just yesterday I picked up and didn't say anything and I could hear a guy speaking Farsi. As soon as I said hello he hung up on me. If I call them back then it'll take me to a rep and when I ask them to remove me from their list they just hang up on me. 

I would love to scare the shit out of them or take legal action. It kinda freaks me out when I answer and get hung up on. Can anyone help me?

**Now the problem:**    

Just recently (within the last week) I would turn my PC on and it would load to the login screen. After I entering the password it would load the desktop and after about 10 seconds my mouse would freeze, my keyboard would be unresponsive and then the video would cut out. Every now and then after doing this my PC would restart but would meet the same doom. **This is a list of the things I tried to fix it:**  


* Draining the power after the PSU is unplugged  
* Reseating the RAM  
* Reseating the GPU  
* Resetting the BIOS (by removing the little round battery)  
* [Following these directions to make sure I'm not a crazy person](http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/261145-31-perform-steps-posting-post-boot-video-problems)  

Anyhow, it's a new build (been working fine for about 4 months). 








































































































 You people loved the shit out of "Let Nas Down" by J. Cole. I love that shit too. I love the shit out of it. But all be damned. I post a link to NAS' FUCKING RESPONSE and you look the other way? J COLE WAS INSPIRED BY NAS (you'd know that by listening to "Let Nas Down") because Nas is a lyrical master. When J. Cole made that first album and became a bubble gum rapper, NAS SAID "Hey man! What the fuck!? You're better than that shit dude."  

J. Cole was obviously upset that his idol criticized him so he poured his heart and soul into [Born Sinner](http://open.spotify.com/album/1NfrmcXk8xNennyxQ57JcW) and especially that one fucking song you people liked ([Let Nas Down](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLF39513uwM)).

Well guess the fuck what? Nas heard the damn song, took the beat and intro and made a fucking response out of it. JESUS CHRIST. IS THAT NOT THE MOST BADASS THING YOU'VE EVER FUCKING HEARD? I'm not going to spoil the damn song for you all. It's worth a listen. 

"But but... it's rap" -asshole 
"Shut the fuck up and open your damn mind fool" - me  

"But it's 3 minutes long." -asshole
"Are you fucking kidding me? You spend more than three minutes jerking off getting the same euphoria that this 3 minutes will bring your bitch ass." - me  

"But your words... they hurt my feelings." -asshole
"Grow the fuck up you little bitch. Life hurts. Cry a river, build a bridge, get the fuck over it and listen to the goddamn song or so help me I will find you and implant a goddamn chip into your head that loops 'Banana Phone' into your mind nonstop. The only thing that'll make it stop is you getting over your hypocritical mentality and listening to the goddamn song." - me


[LISTEN TO IT SHIT FUCK CHRIST CROSS BITCH NIGGA.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgcAPrmz4zg)  

And if you've already listened to it and are like "Dude, chill the fuck out. I loved that shit too." then good for you. Let's eat crumpets some time. 


Also, discuss your thoughts on both songs.

You know how it went on sale 2 days ago? Well this whole damn time I've owned the game I have just assumed I've had it. Until last night.

I play mulitplayer with some friends of mine and I try and join their game only to find out I don't actually have it and now it's $30 (a little ridiculous for a DLC if you ask me). If you have an extra copy from a bundle, i'd appreciate it.

I'll even draw something in mspaint for you if you comment (you don't have to give me the game for me to draw.) 




 One of you fine people posted a couple weeks ago about this site called usertesting.com.

I sign up and took a practice test (which paid out $10), got a 5 star rating and haven't really received a test since. I mean, you get screened for most of them (which, so far, has led me to 0 successes). 

Do you have any tips or tricks on getting new tests? I mean shit, I'd love the extra work but it is so damn picky. Should I just lie or something? I'd hate to do that. 




 Open to accounts older than 2 months.

To enter:

1. Comment with the game you'd like  
2. In mspaint, draw me your best interpretation of what the word "flargepool" is/means

 




 All I wanted was Crusader Kings 2 (can't beat the price, it's $24 on sale and humblebundle but $6.74 with the jumbo bundle)

* Deadlight
* The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing - Complete Pack
* Galactic Civilizations II: Ultimate Edition
* Terraria
* THE KING OF FIGHTERS XIII STEAM EDITION
* Legend of Grimrock
* Orcs Must Die! 2: Complete Pack
* PixelJunk Eden


RULES:   
1. I will only gift games to people that **have not received**.   
2. Your account **MUST** be at least 2 months old and have at least 35 comment karma (none of these sit-and-wait accounts)  
3. **DO NOT PM ME.**   

**To Enter:**  

You must comment with the game you want (1 game per user), your steam ID, and your best mspaint drawn interpretation of what it means to be a "cattyflanger"

Winners will be picked in 24 hours.


Edit: Guys, I fucked up. I'll be passing out the games still but I won't make it in my 24 hr period. For this error if you read this, edit your post with another game and I'll give out 2 per winner.

 Hello all, I hope I'm in the right place.  

My yard has a bad chigger problem. If any of us or our animals go out, we get eaten alive. I've been researching non-pesticidal ways to remove them from our yard and have come up with two safe tactics.

1. Nematodes
2. Sulfur  

My problem is, I'd like to rid them while spending the least amount of cash.  

Nematodes work well, I hear, but they are pretty expensive and require a special hose hookup to apply.  

Sulfur is cheap but I'm curious if it will affect my yard's ecosystem in a harmful way. I know it smells (that's not an issue for me) but would that smell keep birds away? What about bees? I'd hate to shoo bees away because of the chiggers. Would it negatively affect my dog?  

Any help would be appreciated.

 Hello everyone! I have an office birthday celebration this friday and the cuisine is "anything salad." I want to bring a keto-heavy salad but am not sure what would go well together. 

Could you help me out? It doesn't have to be limited to your typical leaf salads, keto variants of pasta salads, chicken/tuna salads would work as well.

 I walked into a bathroom and heard this weird noise coming from the stall next to the one I was entering. It was kind of like a small popping noise.

Anyhow, I sit down to take the browns to the superb owl. I pinch a couple of loaves and realize that there is no toilet paper in my stall. Shit! 

I didn't want to walk out with my ass covered in dookie so I asked the man in the stall next to me if he could spare some squares. He shuffles real quick and hands me a wadded up tp bunch with warm liquid on it.

I smelt it (you would too) and it was totes jizz.


TL;DR. Wiped my ass with a jizz soaked TP square.

 This is the second time I've tried it and I keep getting sick. I read about the keto flu but this isn't it. My tonsils have swollen up so bad that my throat is now the size of a quarter.

 At work we have [wall-mounted lock box](http://imgur.com/UEUElTj) where we store keys. It's always been open but yesterday I bumped up against it and closed it. Now it's locked shut and nobody knows the combination.

It's not your typical [multiple-dial lock](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Combination_discs.png), I've looked up youtube guides that tell people to look for markings under the turning dials and it doesn't have that. What I do see is [THIS](http://imgur.com/m3MtVjw). There is a flat surface on the cylinder below all three of the dials. I've tried lining them up facing me with no luck, I tried using the opposite number as well with no luck. I'm not even sure if that's the way I should be going in order to open it.

I need help opening this lock. Any help would be appreciated.

 Hello Gracious Community!

I've recently decided to acquire a road bike and I've got some helpful tips from users on where to find a great selection of used ones under $200 (120.53 pounds, 145.36 euro). Below is a list of links of bikes that I thought looked great. Do you mind giving your two cents on which one would be the best purchase or advice on what a good deal looks like?

Here are some specs as to my body type:

I'm 5ft 8in (172.72cm)  
I weigh 195lbs (88.4505kg)


Also, if you see one that's not worth the price listed, feel free to give me an amount and I'll ask the seller! 

I very much appreciate your assistance. Thank you for the support/help! 









 Hello community!

I have a low-end mountain bike. I bought it used for $25. The only big issue I have with it is the handlebar keeps coming loose! I've tried tightening the bolt and ended up stripping it. I have a new bolt and it's not working to well either. Do you have any recommendations on how to keep it secure? Maybe a trick? 

Also, where is the best place to find used sports bikes? Like the majority of the ones on the front page. I really like their design, the thinner wheels, and the two-placement handlebars. They also look like they're a little lighter than mine. But they're expensive new! 

Thank you so much for your help! 



















 I have quite a few mods I'm interested in using but once I install them (using KSP Mod Admin) and start the game, the loader will run until it hits the middle and then just stop.

Do not forget to provide your Steam ID. Please refrain from requesting if you have already received something from GoG. I know how disappointing it is to submit to countless offers and come up with  nothing, so I'd like to give only the underdogs a chance. 


EDIT FOR ALL:

User /u/lumenation has informed me of this info:

**If you have Sims 3 on steam and try to buy expansions from stores or from Origin, they will not pair with the Sims 3 on steam. Only expac's bought on steam will work with Sims 3.  

However you can use the steam Sims 3 key on origin and any expec's bought on steam with origin as well.
If you knew this or not I just thought I'd let you know so you can inform others. I had issues with this when I originally had Sims 3 on my steam.**

 I went to the doctor recently to get some blood work done. They said that my TSH was running high and that my thryroid isn't producing enough of the hormone. She wants me to start taking levothyroxine. However, I'm scared. What if there is an underlying cause of this occurrence? My family does not have a history of thyroid issues and I had blood work done last year with no thyroid issues (that I know of). I'm scared that if I start taking the supplement that if it's another issue that hasn't been diagnosed and is treatable, that I will eventually become dependant on the medication and my thyroid will stop producing hormones all together. Am I making sense? What can I do? 




 Am I correct in saying that she was once a man? I know that's probably a dumb question. She just looks so much like a woman! Except with a dick. Anyhow, I saw this presentation on shemales and how men get turned on by them. But gay men aren't. It's weird how our brains work. Something called an erotic illusion. Here's the talk: http://youtu.be/p-A8GvUehq4?t=21m35s. 




 I used to hate Yishan, until the thought police seized me. They beat me day in and day out. They deprived me of food, water, and shelter. They made me watch hours upon hours of reality TV (Jersey Shore, Teen Mom, and The Real Housewives of Atlanta) while crushing my ball-sack with a pair of vice grips. They inserted 2-4lb pineapples in most of my orifices and then forced me to eat the fruit. This went on for months.

That is... until Yishan saved me. He came and stopped the torment and he promised me that I would one day come to love him. 

Today is that day, my brothers. He is lov...

 Thanks! I overclocked it to 4.1Ghz but mulitplayer hasn't changed much. I think the highest I can clock it is 4.2, I might try that! 




 Yep! I just upped mine to 4.1ghz and the game is running better! 




 Can you recommend any MP servers that aren't shitty? 




 Well, maybe when I get a higher paying job I'll switch over to an Intel CPU and MOBO.

 Actually, I do have the ability to overclock it and it's water cooled so I believe it can happen!

I've had to turn the graphics down extremely low which makes the game very ugly! It's a beautiful game! I want to experience is in its glory.  

Anyhow, I've come to the conclusion that it's my GPU (Radeon 6870) and I'm looking to purchase a new one (can be a refurbished or used one). One that can handle Arma 3 at (hopefully) max settings. I also don't want to spend a fortune. I'd like to spend at max $240.  

What types of GPUs do you all use to run it at high settings? Any ideas or paths would be greatly appreciated.   


Also: I get rekt in every firefight I encounter, I can't turn fast enough...  




 I love that place! MT is awesome.

Unfortunately I moved to Dallas. I miss my curry. 




 Thanks smilebot. :) 




 Perhaps there is a difference but perhaps not. Everywhere else I've been has a much lighter panang curry, it doesn't look slow cooked from what I can tell. It's not that deep dark red. Makes me sad :(. I just purchased some panang curry paste off of amazon and I'm going to try and make your recipe when it comes in. Man, but nothing beats Madam Mam's panang curry. I could eat it every meal. 




 I wish it was that simple. 




 Awesome! Thank you for the explanation! 




 Lock-out? Tag-out?  




 I don't get it, the first comment in the first link tells you exactly why it might have been deleted.


Keep your conspiracies out of our undeletes.

That's why they are two different subreddits.  




 Oh, I misread your comment.

You were saying that if it's not a bacterial issue then don't give antibiotics.

I thought you said that we shouldn't give out antibiotics for bacterial infections. I was confused considering I am current suffering from an upper respiratory infection. 

Sorry about that. 




 Perhaps rule 0 like the last one?

It's not that funny.

Like 90% of /r/funny is rule 0 




 What about an upper respiratory infection?

 Or just a simple bread recipe. I plan on grilling some bratwurst this weekend and I'd really like an easy keto-friendly bun recipe.

 I have no idea where to begin. I thought taking this practice test provided [through the LSAC website](http://www.lsac.org/docs/default-source/jd-docs/sampleptjune.pdf) would be a good gauge on where I currently stand. 

So far I figured I suck at the logic games. 

I'd love to be able to score high by the December 8th test but I also know they have one in February too. Would it be better to wait until February?

I'm also not made of money and a lot of these tutoring sessions are half my monthly income. 

I've talked to a couple of friends I know who are in law school and they said that they had both taken courses. I think one did a private tutor (which cost him a shit load) and the other took a princeton review course (the lowest one being $1550 (3/4ths of my income)).

I've looked at the links provided on the sidebar and I hear the Blueprint is a decent service that's only under $900.

 I was thinking about that being a possibility. He said his head starting ringing, I thought that happens when you get hit in the temple.

 I totally get that.

He's bleeding internally due to injuries sustained from her kicking him in the stomach though.

That means his organs got messed up. That sounds like an emergency room visit. 




 Half the stuff on this subreddit it complete BS.

This guy got kicked so hard he was bleeding out of his mouth and he decided *not* to go the the hospital?  




 So she kicked you so hard you were bleeding out of your mouth?  

Then you didn't go to the hospital?  

I'm calling BS. 




 Because it's a lie.

 Yay! I'm so glad you liked them! 

I'll be frying some up tomorrow. I got a craving!  




 How? I'd like a change in career.  




 I have one too, I've made like $3 and I can't cash out until $100.

It's been over a year... 




 Here is the recipe!  

http://cavemanketo.com/crispy-wings/  

If you're trying to cut back on fat, then baking would be best.

I'm on the keto diet so I'm just trying to limit my carb intake and let me tell you, I fry chicken thighs this way and I can't believe how crispy they turn out! 

 




 I find that cooking the broccoli helps more.  




 I do it over the stove, I think if you're using a deep fryer you use its lowest setting first (like 280F) and then crank it up to high (380F?) 




 All I get are pictures of Gary Oldman 




 "Blue" "Waffle" 




 Try the twice fry method:  

14 minutes on medium heat   

3 minutes on high heat   

They come out like breaded fried chicken. I'll never eat them any other way.  




 I've got this weird gut issue where if I eat too much raw broccoli I won't digest it and end up pooping chunks of raw broccoli.

 




 I was having a discussion with a cab driver while abroad in Mexico and he flat-out asked:  

"All black people are evil, right?"  

And just turned the question on him.  

"Are all brown people evil? Are all Asians evil? No? Well that's your answer."

 Wow, you must be in a fraternity (or you are 10) having said that last line.

do you only hate the guys that stole your college girlfriends?

I got a little mixed up, not 'TOS' but 'User Agreement' 

Correct me if I'm wrong but I believe this says that OP doesn't own his content once placed on reddit; reddit owns the content. 

So no, not public domain. My bad. 




 It's a site wide rule. 




 Ha! 'Legal protection'

Once it's on reddit it belongs to reddit.

You should read the User Agreement sometime. 

EDIT: fixed some incorrect information.  




 He was soliciting his story. Basically trying to make money off of it. That is 'self-promotion'

Make sense?  




 Can you ask him what he did. I've searched all around and haven't found a solution even when searching "AMD Rust fix".

 Why can't I watch the theatrical release of Anchorman 2? The only one I see on Netfilx is the extended edition which completely sucked.  




 Anyone know what the limit is? 




 I have a friend with the same card that doesn't have any issues. I believe that somehow it configured itself to use my CPU instead of my GPU to render everything. Like it didn't think I had a dedicated GPU. 




 The game ran completely fine before the experimental version came out. After that it has been super laggy. 




 I think this will be the last game I ever purchase in Alpha.

 Holy shit. 

121 went down to one lane a couple of weeks ago (where it enters Garland) and there were signs for miles saying "left lane closed ahead".  

We get 500m from where the lanes merge and what do you see? A bunch of assholes getting in the left lane to cut people off at the end.  

I placed my car between my lane and the left lane to stop them and all they did was drive in the shoulder to go around to be stuck at the end.  

I don't get it. 

EDIT: Looks like this isn't the proper, efficient thing to do! Don't be me; don't be wrong. 




 My worst enemy.  

5 years ago I went into a Firehouse Subs and asked for the hottest sauce they had.  

The man handed me this sauce.  

I placed a crap load on my sandwich, ate it all up with minimal tears, and left the store.  

That's when it hit me. It felt like Bruce Lee was in my stomach trying to kick his way out.

I drove to the nearest dollar store to pick up some pepto bismol and I felt James Bond drugged (from that scene in Casino Royale) as I walked to their bathroom where I proceeded to puke.  

  




 I hate Jake! I can't see him as a tough actor. 




 It was so surreal. 




 Oh, I completely agree! I enjoyed the loud. It made me feel like I was there. 




 I believe a lot of people were bitching about it being so loud.

I think it was loud on purpose. Like when Michael Cain's big reveal is practically inaudible due to the sound? Yeah, that might just be the director trying to convey how you would feel if you heard that. You hear the truth and then nothing else matters. 

Or the shuttle taking off? SHIT FLYING INTO SPACE IS LOUD...

Just like OP! 




 They sent me the same letter/email for 3 months straight.  

I never called in, I never upgraded, and the never forced me to upgrade.  
 
I believe it's just a scare tactic. And if what they did to me is similar to what they do to others, it should be illegal. 




 I have cable one too!

Don't worry, they sent me the same emails for 3 months and never did shit.

 And legend has it that they'll drop the worm in the bottle. If it dies before it hits the bottom, it's a good bottle of mescal.  




 It's a species of worm that feeds on the plant. It is just a worm, not a hallucinogen. 

There is a dish served in that area that is a bunch of the worms fried up. I've had it, it's pretty good!

Now that I have it, I've stopped playing. I want others to have a shot at that glorious feeling that comes after acquiring such a difficult flair.

 Thing is, they are so expensive!  




 Could you recommend a brand of carbless sweetener?  




 What do you use instead?
 




 It's found in a wide variety of powdered artificial sweeteners, from stevia to splenda. It's a starch and the ratio in stevia, splenda, is 1:1 so a 550 serving [bag of stevia](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/91hm25DmYML._SL1500_.jpg) will have 550g of carbs from maltodextrin. 

I know 1g carb per 1 tablespoon isn't a bad amount of carbs but I was startled when a friend of mine did the research. 

Anyhow, what do you think?

 Just to let you know:

I fucking hate Dr. Who AND 'How I met your mother'

The former is a cheap-ass show where every supporting actor fucking sucks at their job and the special effects are lame.

The latter because it's just not funny. Canned laughs all over the place and Ted is a fucking moronic character  




 The redditor that uses 'cause' in place of 'because'

They're two different fucking words.  




 I can't find any "Sugar Tax" in the article.

  Nice pic. It's hard for me to picture water not spraying out from the gap between my legs or between the seat and the butt crack

Oh, I need to answer this. You can adjust the position of the nozzle to get the perfect shot at your keester. 

Also, I'd recommend buying a foot stool. If you put your feet on it while pooping, your body will form the natural position for pooping. This gets the poop out easier and is easier on your colon. It's way more comfortable too.  




 There are some on Amazon that you can get for under $30. Don't pay more than $30.  




 I'd like to pursue comedy too. I can make people laugh pretty easily.

I'm currently seeking employment in a bigger city. One that has comedy clubs.  

You should do the same, try comedy out at a club. It's not just great for showing you if you're truly interested but it can help refine your talent.

 Logic's really upfront with his influences, which is a lot better than jocking the style without giving props

Oh, and that is one thing I appreciate about him. He seems very grateful of the inspiration previous artists have gave him.  




 I completely agree. It works in Midnight Marauders (I'm currently listening to that album) but it absolutely does not in Under Pressure.  




 I sleep on my back with my feet straight up.  




 I cannot understand why Logic chose to audio morph these endings. 

I appreciate learning about different anecdotes about him and the creation of the album but I just cannot understand why he made them all choppy and weird. It really kills the flow of the album, IMO. 

Here's some samples of what I'm talking about in case you haven't listened to the album:

['Metropolis' outro](http://youtu.be/4bdMtenCBjc?t=4m42s)  

['Buried Alive' outro](http://youtu.be/tqJ24z5ys4U?t=5m17s)

['Bounce' outro](http://youtu.be/ENDuSctl8h4?t=3m45s)

ETC.

I really love the album, I think the beats and lyrics are awesome. I just don't get it.

I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Shreks, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on fairytale creatures, and I have over 300 confirmed layers. I am trained in donkeh warfare and I'm the top shreker in the entire Duloc armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will shrek you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before in this swamp, mark my shreking words. You think you can get away with coming into my swamp? Think again, mothershreker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of ogres across Duloc and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, swamp maggot. The storm that shreks out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking shreked, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can shrek you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare ear tube antenna things. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed shrekage, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Ogre Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to shrek your miserable ass off the face of my swamp, you little long-nosed puppet. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your shreking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn trespasser. I will shrek fury all over you and you will drown in in the mud of my swamp. You're shreking shreked, kiddo.

 Yeah, and all these 'engineers' bitching about 'LE LIBRAL ARTS R BAD'  

The school I went to had so many graduates move on to medical school and other degree programs. My school was/is notorious for getting graduates out in four years. There were/are plenty of undergraduate research opportunities available. I could go on.  

Sure, they're not meant for everyone but neither is higher education.  

I'd say it was well worth the 10k a year I paid.

 I didn't mean his religious beliefs. To each their own.

 I mean, he did sign up for an 'Ask me anything." 




 Kevin, here is a comment you made about the Ferguson protestors (I'll hyperlink it so you can click it and be taken to the source):

[Ferguson riots have very little to do with the shooting of the young man. It is an excuse to be the losers these animals truly are. **It is a tipping point to frustration built up over years of not trying, but blaming everyone else, The Man, for their failures.** It's always someone else's fault when you give up. Hopefully this is a reminder to the African Americans \( I always thought we just Americans. Oh, well.\) that their President [they] voted in has only made things worse for them, not better.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/21/kevin-sorbo-ferguson-animals-losers_n_5697647.html)

My questions is as follows:  

In regards to the selection I have bolded: Do you really believe that African Americans are not at a disadvantage in our (American) society? Enslaved for hundreds of years, [falsely reported as inferior by pseudo-scientific studies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_racism#United_States:_slavery_justified), segregated after emancipation, subjected to [institutional racism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_racism#United_States) (especially in Ferguson, MO as cited by a [DOJ report](http://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/opa/press-releases/attachments/2015/03/04/ferguson_police_department_report.pdf)), constantly bashed by conservative media, etc. After all of the history and examples I have linked, do you still believe they are simply "not trying"?
 




 I feel bad if he receives downright hateful comments. Those are just confirming his biases on atheism. 

I do appreciate people questioning his beliefs, especially the ones he holds that are ignorant.   




 "I immediately regret this decision."

 I got a creepy-crawly machine for Christmas when I was young.

But I couldn't eat my creations. I wanted cupcakes because I loved food. 




 We're only hearing OP's side of the story.

Anyway, I must be lost because /r/pettyrevenge doesn't seem like the place to question the revenge that took place. It's more of a "yeah fuck that person" bandwagon.  




 I try to empathize with people. I wonder what made that lady close her store so early? Maybe a bad day?  




 The first panic attack I ever had was when I lit up my first joint. My heart started racing and I felt like I was losing control.   

I kept jumping up and down saying "you see, it's not a dream because you're not flying."

I continued to touch everything I could because I was convinced that I was dreaming. I went to bed that night and I wasn't the same for months. I was in constant dismay about reality. I would have panic attacks. 'Inception' struck a chord and I haven't watched the movie since.   

Then I was with a close friend and I started projecting my issues to him. He said: 

"You know, test_subject4255, even if we are living in a dream, isn't it the best dream ever?"

I haven't forgot that since. 

I was convinced that I just had a laced joint so I had to prove to myself that it was a fluke. I've smoked twice since (over a 6 year period) and I have had some good experiences. Things that really turned my mind around. I don't plan on using it again because it's really not my taste but I'm glad I got over my fear. I haven't had a panic attack since.  

Anyway, I know that you're probably trying to find a connection between your current state and my story and I just wanted to let you know that it is MORE THAN OKAY to reach out to supportive loved ones/friends about your issues. Who knows? One of them might make you feel a ton better.   

Edit: I am not condoning the usage of marijuana. This is just simply my story about a bout of depression I experienced. If you are medically depressed, I am also not condoning skipping of meds/holistic cures/not getting treated. Some people are born with chemical imbalances that medication can help with.

 **Meatballs**  

* 1 roll spicy country pork sausage   
* 1 roll spicy Italian sausage   
* Handful of chopped arugula   
* Large handful of cubed or shredded mozzarella   
* Sea salt to taste (I used smoked salt) 

Form meatballs and place in a hot skillet. Cook until halfway done  

**Broth**   

* 1 medium carrot 
* 4ish green onions   
* 1 stick of celery   
* 1/2 stick of butter   
* Bullion or broth of your choice  
* 1 Chayote squash  
* 1 chicken thigh, chopped ham, or bacon   
* 1 jalapeno   
* 1 gallon of water   
* Sea salt to taste

Get pot hot and toss in butter, chopped carrot, jalapeno, green onion, and celery. Mix occasionally and let it come together, about five minutes Chop chicken and add it, cook halfway and add the water. Add bullion to taste.

Toss in chopped squash and bring water to a good simmer. Let simmer until flavors come together. Add meatballs and grease from pan.   

Cook until meatballs are done.  

Dish, top with parmesan cheese and cilantro (or arugula if you don't like cilantro)  
**Enjoy!**  

The squash is about 4.5-5 net carbs   
Arugula is 2 carbs per cup  
Carrot about 3 carbs   
Celery is about 2 carbs   
Green onions are 2 per onion  

One pot of soup (21 - 24 carbs) made at least six bowls for me, so the carbs are spaced out pretty well (3.5-4 carbs per serving).

 I there with you. I've had HBP since I was 18. I'm 25 now. Stress was an important factor but my HBP didn't go down until I changed my diet. 

I'm not sure what will work for you but I started cutting carbs out and it made a huge difference. I know it sounds weird because fat (for a long time) has been thought to cause heart problems. I have (in my experience) found it to be the opposite. I'm on a high-fat low-carb diet and I've never felt better. Keep in mind, I count calories too. Too many and you'll gain more weight. 

Everytime I mention the following subreddit I get downvoted, but you should check out /r/keto. Now ketosis is used mainly by super overweight people as a weight loss program (they'll lose like 20lbs a month). I'm a 5'9" 180lb male and I just use it as a diet program. I eat red meat, chicken, vegetables, etc. I try to eat a lot of fiber and healthy fats. It's helped my blood pressure and heart rate immensely. With the diet you lose out on potassium and magnesium and you'll have to take supplements. You also need to drink a lot of water. 

Exercise is important also. I try to walk everywhere I go but I'm not super active (I really should be).  




 There needs to be a rule against fake shit.  




 That dude was so fucking awkward. 




 Probably because this post is tagged [Serious] and they were making jokes. 




 Wait, so alcohol kills stomach bacteria too?  




 Totally agree. I've appreciated every video I've seen on here. Random ideas for videos are original ideas. There's no need to hate these creators. Want better videos? Make your own or browse /r/videos. 




 I honestly believe that most of his supporters have no idea his name is "Rafael Edward Cruz". 




 You're acting like they're not going to get punished.  




 I doubt it. If the kid had a gun and was threatening the old man, that's what would be reported. Self defense. You're just hyperbolizing to fit your "gun-freedom" agenda.

 I cannot make this up:

https://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/30081a/what_is_a_song_that_you_will_forever_associate/ 









 It's a damn fine guess.  




 I thought that might have been the case. Thanks for informing me! 




 I just wish they spent more of that money on infrastructure. Austin roads can't handle everyday traffic let alone the floods of people there for SXSW and ACL.  




 Thankfully, yes. I was a sophomore in high school at the time. I graduated, went to college, and now have a stable job and a semi-stable life. A ton better than what it used to be. 

Gosh, it doesn't feel that long ago. It's been more than six years. Woah. Time flies. 




 Like most TIFUs this didn't actually happen today. This happened 8 years ago. 

I grew up in the south Austin area and some new gang members from California had moved into the area. I wasn't involved in gang activity but I knew a lot of kids that were. 

One day I was walking home from a friends house and a truck pulls up to me with a couple of guys asking where my neighbor was. I told them I didn't know and they said that if I found out, let him know they're looking for him.

The next day in school I find out that they had a pistol on them and so I inform my neighbor's sister that they intend to kill her brother. I ask her to leave my name out of the mix when she confronts the principle about the problem but... she fails to do so.

A couple of days go by and I jump into bed and feel a cold piece of metal at my feet. I go to look at it and it's the head of a bullet. Then I start seeing holes in my walls. I lived in a trailer home (I had the middle most room, the trailer was facing the street [like this](http://i.imgur.com/d8zsEne.png)) and that bullet and two others had ripped through about 4 walls of my home. One hit a top bar of my bunk bed and fell into the bottom bunk. One ripped through the bathtub, my dresser drawer and landed in my box fan, and the other hit the bottom skirting of my house, landing underneath it. 

One bullet passed above me and my sister and the other below us. I never heard the shots (it must have been fired in the middle of the night a couple of nights before) and I never found out who did it. I called the cops, found the brass casings, but nothing ever came of it. We lived in the poor side of town so I didn't expect much. 

tl;dr: snitched and almost got stitched. 

Edit: Dangit! I meant to edit the title before I hit 'submit'. My neighbor ended up living. They backed off after his sister got the police and principle involved.  




 I hope it is and I hope it further tarnishes his name.

Or maybe I hope it doesn't and he gets chosen as their running man. He is sure to lose. 




 I think OP is just sick of the double-standards when it comes to the GOP. 




 That Obama was born on American soil and everyone had a bitch-fit about seeing his birth certificate. The double-standard that nobody is complaining when a white republican is technically 'less-American' 




 When I eat at McDonald's I'll usually get a couple of McDoubles. I ALWAYS ask for them to be in the same box but they rarely ever listen!!! I don't want to waste the paper but they'll individually box each one...

 Yes, when comments devolve to people spreading hate-speech, us moderators take action. I put a flair on the post to warn people.  




 I mean, that's how elections work?  

If you're talking about gerrymandering then I understand what you mean. Many districts don't really have a legit choice in who wins their representation because either side will always win.  




 I'd love to hear your side of the bill. I am completely against it.  




 We are about to have an [open-carry law](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/03/17/texas-senate-gun-open-carry/24892513/) on public college campuses too...  




 It's just the voters that elect them's fault. :(

 How the fuck could I let myself get all worked up over eggs?  

My SO and I live together with a 3rd roommate. We'll call my SO "Lilly" and our roommate "Cindy".  

Lilly and I pretty much share almost nothing. When we shop together I buy stuff I need and she buys stuff she needs. Now with certain products, we'll rotate purchase. Eggs especially. I'll buy them one time and she'll get the next time, etc.  

Recently she's been shadowing a teacher that has about 80 chickens and she will give Lilly a dozen almost every week. So now we don't have to buy eggs because we're getting a steady supply of delicious farm-fresh eggs... until right now.  

Spring break was last week so we didn't get our weekly dozen. When I checked the carton yesterday we had 2 left, enough for a breakfast. So this evening I'm getting all excited because I figure I'll eat the two tomorrow morning and then when Lilly and I go to the store tomorrow evening, I'll buy a dozen. So as we're winding down in bed I ask Lilly "hey, will you make sure I get up at 7:30 tomorrow? I want to eat breakfast." Now mind you, I'm not a big breakfast guy. I'm trying to get in the habit of it because I'm always so unproductive in the mornings.   

Lilly says "Sure, but there's only one egg left and I'm taking it for lunch tomorrow."   


WHAT. "Lilly, why didn't you tell me we were down to our last egg?"  

"Well you never eat breakfast, megabenson." (Fair point)

"But but... Dammit! Now I have go to the store now and buy more!"   

So I get up, put my shit on, and head outside to my car. Except I'm blocked in by Cindy and my next door neighbors and Cindy is fast asleep.   

I get so damn mad! OVER SOMETHING SO SMALL.   

Mind you, I wasn't mad at my SO. I was mad because now I'm going to be hungry tomorrow morning and all I have are a few slices of ham and 0 eggs...   

Man fuck this. So fucking stupid.   




 Please use np.reddit.com when linking threads. 

It discourages people from downvote brigading.  




 Sweet, I will attempt that this afternoon.  




 If I somehow found my product key, would it be as simple as transferring those files (via safe mode) to a usb, writing down the product key, and then fresh installing the OS on a new HDD? 




  magic jelly bean key finder

I might be able to run this program in safe-mode to find the key. 




 A friend of mine gave it to me. He installed it via flash drive on my tower (I don't have a cd drive). He copied the installation files onto another flash drive (so just in case something like this happened) and gave me them. 

The product key might be within the folder I placed those files into but that folder is on the broken HDD.

Edit: I'm not sure if it was a genuine copy or not. It didn't seem ripped because there were no special hoops he had to jump through. 

I think I might just have to buy another copy of it.  




 Yeah, the problem with that is I had a usb with those files on it. I moved them over to my system (I needed to use the usb to store a big project) and guess what? They are on the crashed drive. :/ 




 I don't understand why Windows 7 and 8.1 are the same price. The only thing I can think of is that they are trying their best to phase-out Windows 7. 

For how old Windows 7 is, I don't think $100 is a reasonable price so I'm looking to you all for help with this matter. Maybe you know of a not-so-common software shop that has copies or maybe you know about decent sales going on around the internet. 

Your help is greatly appreciated.

 Oh thank god.  




 I guess I'm not that weird. Lol 




 Yeah, it's weird but totally normal.  




 You are quite welcome!  
























 I can imagine that some users want their content to take off so bad that they downvote all above and below them on the 'new' page.  




 Thank you! 




 I just think this would be a really good way to disappoint a redditor.  




 I'm the hacker that fucked this all up. 




 Because it's an anti joke. 




 I predict that there will be some users that submit the survey more than once. I highly doubt there are users that are going to sit in front of this survey and fill it out 100 times.  




 You know, I'm not experiencing this. I just sorta came up with it. :) 




 Is there a similar website like ZenniOptical that you use for contacts that can get them to you at a low price? 




 The knife that went through it.  




 Thank you! 




 You PM him/her over a period of months until you gain their trust. You find out that they actually live in the same city as you, in fact, just a couple of blocks down. You share pictures of yourselves with each other, slowly piecing together your independent lives. You find that you have similar interests including vast collections of fedoras, novelty swords, and NES cartridges. You muster up the courage to let them know you have feelings for them. You find that they share the same feelings towards you. You share more intimate photographs with each other leading into ending every night with a message in your inbox that says "Goodnight, I love you, I can't wait to meet you."

You decide to take the initiative and set up a date together. You invite them out to the local Hilton restaurant for a fancy meal followed by a night out on the town on Monday, April 20th, 2015 at 6:00pm Central Standard Time.

You wait until the eve of that fateful night and never leave your driveway.  




 BOOO CAPTIONS 




 Yes, but what are the ratios and cooking instructions? 




 Don't pick it up bare handed!!!!

There is a flesh-eating bacteria that is present on those chunks!  




 Yeah!

I was a little curious after the shampoo washed out of my hair, down my face, and into my mouth. It was very salty!  

Then I noticed that the shower gel is the same consistency! Naturally, I was curious about its taste so I tried it to compare. SAME FLAVOR, super salty!  

That's when I looked at the ingredients. They are the same!   

Yes, I could've skipped the second try but some minds work differently from others. 




 Yeah, I just found out that the Internet on campus is sluggish today. Sorry about that!

 I have a business proposal for all of you worried about the change:

Step 2: Wait a couple of months after the new mac hits the shelves  
Step 3: Sell your stockpile at a premium  
Step 4: Profit. 




 If you don't mind me asking, I have been trying to get into the IT world. How did you do it?    

Any sort of special classes you took? I already have my bachelor's degree (in history) but I am great with computers. Like, I do IT work in my office for my coworkers. 




 You seem to know your bugs.

Would you mind informing me what kind of bug is in this amber I found? 

http://youtu.be/fieTpX7DQE8

It's legit amber too. It was partially encased in rock and I cleaned up the stone. 




 I don't understand 




 Not really. 




 I can tell you this by experience. The body wash and shampoo of Spa-Haus taste the same. I then looked at the ingredients... the same.  




 Not sure why you're being downvoted... it completely ruined it! 









 Plus, how long am I supposed to leave it in the hot water?  




 It's because their last emperor's surname was Nguyen and it changing your family surname to match was respectful.

[Source](http://www.ibtimes.com/why-are-so-many-vietnamese-people-named-nguyen-1556359)

By the early 19th century century, the Nguyen Dynasty seized power in Vietnam (which unified the country), prompting yet another wave of surname changes and adoptions. That dynasty, which "awarded" their surname to many people, ruled the country until the end of World War II. Esther Tran Le, a Vietnamese-American journalist based in New York, said that the name Nguyen was the last name of the last dynasty of Vietnamese emperors. Apparently the last King's name was Bao-Dai, but his real name was Nguyen-Vinh-Thu, she said. Many of the Vietnamese [peoples] last names derive from the former Emperors' last names.

 Great question!

Honestly, I'm not sure about the IP address. I would assume no. What I meant by that in the post is that there is a survey site we were considering that had an option to only allow one vote from one IP address. 

This poses an issue when it comes to schools and business. Effectively one vote can determine an entire school's opinion. We wanted to avoid that. 




 PLS 




 Hello /r/gifs users! 

We've been receiving a lot of mod mail from you all regarding 'Power Users' (i.e. those who post content to /r/gifs 20-30 times a day). The complaint stems from other users' inability to submit content to our subreddit and collect the karma that these posts accumulate. 

We've decided to create a survey and let you all decided if we should enact a post limit for users. 

Please take five minutes out of your day to answer! There are two  questions that are mandatory and the rest are silly questions we've come up with to get to know our user base a little better.

The survey is open for all to submit answers to but **PLEASE ONLY SUBMIT IT ONCE**. We had the option to use a feature that only allows one vote from an IP address or allows only users with a Google account to vote BUT we decided that these features would hinder our users' votes. 

**[LINK TO SURVEY](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1otfolOwCvjhUVtLo8lwvO5z3iZGWjkCm43b2XrMqIy8/viewform?usp=send_form)**

Thank you so much for your participation in this community and survey. It means a lot!

Sincerely,

test_subject4255

EDIT: I guess I should have mentioned a date at which the polling ends. How about a week from today? 

Polling ends 4/23/2015 at 12:00pm Central Standard Time. 

EDIT 2: **POLLING HAS ENDED. RESULTS WILL BE GIVEN SOON**

 I think we should just confiscate all guns. No guns = no illegal selling of the weapons, no confusion whether or not you're holding a taser, no gun related deaths.  




 Please give me some sources that say more white men are shot/killed by police than black men.  




 But it does! You don't see white men getting shot by police.  




 Idk, maybe he was afraid? Fight or flight?

 I don't understand. Why would you shoot the guy if he's being held to the ground? Taser or not?

 [REQUEST] GTA V


I know. It's posted as a request nonstop. Let me tell you why I'm different! I'm not.

I just simply don't have the money to purchase a game that I know I will enjoy. I've been a huge fan of the franchise and put a lot of hours into GTA: San Andreas when I had it for Xbox. I never really appreciated GTA: IV because I'm a big fan of flying airplanes and I feel like Liberty City is confined.

San Andreas has been my favorite one out of the series because of its size and GTA: V is the closest sequel that mimics it. I want to rob stores, steal fighter jets, take flying lessons, etc. and I know this game will offer it all to me.

Plus, my SO would be ecstatic considering we first connected with her love of driving down sidewalks.

Thank you for considering me. 

http://steamcommunity.com/id/jrockbarn/ 




 I like it! It's a little dark though and the NPCs are hard to hear.

 I just eat turds. They have already been processed so my body does less work in scavenging the precious vitamins and minerals left behind from the previous tenant. I've refined it so much that I've stopped shitting, there is nothing left to process. The 'waste not diet' is the one you should really be on.  




 It took me about 3-4 weeks to get over my sugar withdrawals. It's crazy. You'd have to experience it to believe me.  




 I get where you are coming from. Yes, it is a disgusting thing. 

If you just try and realize what conditions need to be like for you to willfully take the life of endangered species maybe you'd see that it's probably not what they want to do but is what they must do in order to survive.

On the same note, there is a market for what they do. If you destroy the demand the supply will go with it. This is something that the Chinese government is trying to work on. 




 You came off as super critical of his actions.

 My SO and I split 5 weeks ago. The first two weeks were an absolute nightmare. The third week was much better and now I'm doing just fine.  

Same sort of situation too. 3 years together, she came from money, I didn't. She wanted to be engaged, I don't have the money. She just got her masters degree and is set to live with her parents for a year. We fought about stupid stuff all the time.  

As much as I hated to see her go, in the end it was for the best.   

I was able to finally do what I wanted: move out of Texas. Now I have a job lined up in DC that I will start at the beginning of next month.  

A great book that is helping me get through this is called "How to Survive the Loss of a Love" and I have a copy that I am more than willing to send to you.  

It can be a little preachy at times (I'm not sure if you are religious or not, if you aren't, just look past it) but overall it really puts things into perspective. It taught me to focus on me now.

 




 How old are you? 




 Hahahahaha, you've got to be kidding me.

Black people show deference everyday and are still belittled.  




 Do you want me to draw red lines? That barrel is pointed at people.  




 That gun is pointing at the people running off, can't you see? 




 [You need to rewatch it then because that barrel is pointed at people.](https://youtu.be/R46-XTqXkzE?t=3m11s)

Oh, and nobody is attempting to grab his weapon.  




  there's about 5 seconds total the officer has his firearm out and it is **never once pointed at a person**

 Oh great, another 'I have no idea what a circlejerk is' comment.  




 Oh great, another gun rights circlejerk.  




 Right, and Bernie voted 'No' towards the USA Freedom Act. 




 I subscribed to Darknewt for a time and then once GTA V came out, he stopped doing Morrowind Let's Plays.

http://m.dailykos.com/story/2015/06/01/1389699/-BERNIE-COURIC-Interview-Bernie-is-voting-against-USA-FREEDOM-ACT

Sanders, who opposed the Patriot Act and its reauthorization, said he plans to **vote against** the less-wide-ranging USA Freedom Act, passed last month by the House, which would allow some counterterrorism tools  including the NSAs controversial bulk data collection  to remain in place.  

And just in case you don't know exactly what the USA Freedom Act really is:

http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Freedom_Act  
 




 Booo 




 Bring your concerns to his/her attention. He/She might give you what you want. 




 Or maybe it would have and they thought the filibuster was unnecessary?  




 Nah. 




 Remember the first time Rand Paul filibustered and the top article on Reddit's front page was about it? Remember the first comment? Here's a refresher in case you don't:  

"And Bernie voted YES!"  

That was a load of horse shit. Bernie voted yes for cloture. That means he voted yes to having a vote. He did not vote yes on the bill itself.    

Whatever user made that comment is a smart cookie. He knew reddit never actually reads articles or confirms them with their own research. So what we got was everyone shouting "BERNIE SUPPORTS DOMESTIC SPYING?" when in reality they should've been shouting "BERNIE SUPPORTS THE ABILITY TO VOTE ON THIS BILL!?" which doesn't sound as circlejerky. 




 It wasn't that soon after. You're just appealing to reddit's dick. 




 Booooo 




 Back when the game was good. 




 Why would you put ice cream in your back pocket? Weren't your afraid it would melt and get your pants/shorts all icky?  




 I can't wait until this isn't a thing anymore. 




 It happened at college campuses too.  




 Oh, shit is bright! 




 $45 dollar flight from Dallas to DC? I'll take a little shit. 




 Why didn't they do this at night? 




 Baby, did you just fart because you blew me away. 




 The program will die with or without Rand's filibuster. He is just doing this for PR. Bernie knows it will die and wants to stop Rand's huge waste of time.

 




 His point is: "Rand is better"

I completely disagree.  




 I appreciate your appreciation. 




 Better enjoy it. Bird flu has taken 50 million chickens to heaven. 




 Where did you hear that? 




 Ah, it all made sense with the band at the end. Thank you for the explanation. 




 Ok, I know this is real. Like, no little play sets, but why do the people look like they are claymation? 




 I would love a resume spruce up. I will PM you. 




 The link is broken. You need to take the 'www.' out of it. 









 That is odd. I'm not sure why it's not working. I viewed it in incognito mode without any problems. 









 I didn't like the game but I am from the area that the first sequence happens in. It was cool to be able to recognize where they were in regards to me being in that location! 




 Deus Ex: Human Revolution

Not just a great opening, but a great plot and story. 




 "Edit: Front page! 

Edit: Thanks for the gold, kind stranger!" 




 I was a little shit in elementary school.   

In 5th grade my mother, sister, and I moved out to a rural area from an urban area because my parents separated.   

Coming from an urban school I had this shitty mentality that I was smarter than all of the rural kids. I wasn't very nice to my classmates or teacher. I was a really shitty kid.  

Anyhow, I had a terrible problem turning assignments in, so bad that my teacher did not allow me to participate in the honors program at my school. Naturally I was angered by her actions and over the next couple of days disrespected her constantly! She finally had the last straw, grabbed my arm and dragged me to the front office to retrieve my mother's contact information that was located in a rolodex on a form all students turned in at the beginning of the year.  

She's spinning and searching and finally located my form...

"OF COURSE!" she exclaimed "It's a blank piece of paper because you never turn anything in!"

I just smirked devilishly. 


She brought me back to the classroom and told me to call my mother from the classroom phone. I started to punch in a bunch of random numbers and professed that I didn't remember it (I was lying).

TL;DR: I was a little shit.  




 Holy shit, leave the innocent animals out of your crusade! If this was a member/members of FLDS, they are going to have a hard time getting into heaven with this on their resume.  




 Where did you hear that? 




 Once a cheater always a cheater!

Either she did this to you before and you forgave her OR this story is complete bullshit with a phrase reddit throws around that gets upvoted. 




 I think it's just the users from racist subreddits that jack each other off in default sub posts that involve race.  




 FANTASTIC!  




 So, I was able to test the part. It functioned accordingly. The problem went away for a bit but I decided to retest the error codes.  

It still said 14. Anyhow, I immediately started the engine in order to run the car for a bit (with the paper clip still in the connector) and the car jumped then completely shut down. Now the dash isn't getting any power, turning the key does nothing. No lights, no A/C, nothing.  

What did I do wrong? 




 You can download a pizza???? 




 Just ran the test and got a 14. [If this chart is correct](http://honda-tech.com/honda-accord-1990-2002-2/check-engine-light-codes-cel-diagnostic-trouble-codes-dtc-malfunction-indicator-light-mil-1490107/), it is indeed the IACV.   

14	P0505	ICS Malfunction  
14	P1508	IAC Valve Circuit Failure  
14	P1509	IAC Valve Circuit Failure  
14	P1519   	Idle Air Control Valve Circuit Failure  

What is the best way to test it, or rather, how do I test it with the method you mentioned? 




 Imagine the domino explosion effect that would take place if this was a GTA game. 




 Awesome! I lost my book awhile back, thanks for the link! 




 Thank you for your response!

That was one of the first things I did to it once the issue arose. I cleaned the IACV and put it back in and bought a new MAP sensor to put in. Maybe I should try a new IACV? 




 Could old fuel be causing this issue? When it finally gave out it was about 3/4th of the way full. Anyway to responsibly dispose of that gas so I can fill it with fresh gas?   

What's the best way (and cheapest) to look for leaks in the vacuum?   

I have checked around to make sure no wires have been chewed up: all clear.

I cleaned the throttle body like 3 years ago and I recently cleaned the IACV. MAybe I should get a new IACV? 




 Thanks! I do not know how to access the trouble codes, but I will google it.

I have cleaned the IACV (like in January) and the it's been about 3 years since the throttle body has been cleaned.  




 You can get MRSA from popping a pubic zit? 




 I heard it's another way he punishes his wife. 




 I could be wrong! Another user responded to me. 




 What about the actual question? Who would you vote for? 




 Hmm...  

It must have been the mod from Arma 3.  

I remember trying to download the client and it was taken down.  

You're taking about the Arma 2 mod, that one is still up? 




 Last I checked, DayZ mod doesn't exist anymore because of copyright issues that spawned from the standalone.

I tried playing a couple of weeks ago with no luck, or maybe that was a DayZ mod for Arma 3. I am having troubles recalling.  









 Yep, just rustling some jimmies.  




 You have a source on that stat? 




 Just like concealed/open carry holders! 




 I must've missed that!  




 Where'd you hear that!?  




 Baltimore ~~Protesters~~ Looters/Rioters Tried To Light This Pizza Shop Owner on Fire 




 A browser you could log into and it would save your bookmarks.

I submitted a business tip to Google back in 2010 about this idea. A year and a half later it was an option in Chrome. 

Would I have liked to be the catalyst in that? Yes.

Is it possible it was already in development before the time of my email? Yes.

I will never know. 

Google, if you are reading this, I am sorry my immature younger self reacted to this situation. In five years I have really grown and now I look back and think: 'how stupid/arrogant were you!'
 




 Dude, I am in the same situation! 

You wouldn't happen to be in higher education, would you?  




 Hands off my jerbs. Hahaha, jk. I hope we can both land a gig! 




 Do you know any good recruiters? 




 You're a server admin? That's awesome! How did you get there? Just volunteering? What was your first job? 




 Well, that department has a great retention rate, so I don't see any positions opening for the next 3 years. 

I do have a linkedin! I updated it last week. What else should I include on it? 




 How the heck do I convince a company that I am great with technology? 

I graduated with a BA in History but I've been working on computers since I was 9 years old. I am currently 25 and I am called upon in my office when someone's computer is malfunctioning. 99% of the time I fix it, and we HAVE AN **IT** DEPARTMENT!!!!

I've applied to numerous IT positions in the Dallas area and have created a great cover letter to supplment my application that goes over my qualification. I'm getting antsy though! I have on heard back from one employer who asked for an interview, when I told him the times I was available, he never got back to me! 

I have two months to find a position in the Dallas area or I am going to be homeless.  




 Rip non mobile users. Lol 




 He did!? I MUST'VE MISSED IT! 




 BOOO CAPTIONS 




 Where did you hear that? 









 So much passive aggression!  









 I would buy this.  




 Staphylococcus = Staph infection

Staph sounds like Staff.

It's essentially 'Staff Only'  

Edit: Don't google 'staph infection' unless you'd rather not eat today.  




 Yeah! It's made of ducks. 




 BOOO CAPTIONS 




 Nice to know that this information was posted in /r/games before this shitty meme subreddit.  




 You're part of the problem. 




 Remember, these aren't protesters. These are looters.

 We need a picture of it in your mouth!  




 Haha, yes!  




 You might try sprinkling some salt on the zucchini slices and setting them aside while you prepare everything else. Should make them less ~~salty~~ soggy. 




 Let's throw you in, you racist.  




 Yes, lives are worth less than items. /s 




 Someone beat you to it

 This subreddit makes no sense. I post a picture of a panda that looks like a dog - downvoted. OP posts a picture with the description matching a part of the image - upvoted.

Wtf. 




 Wow, it's soooo simple!

 A real man loves her everyday of the month. 




 Thank you for saying this.  




 I'm sorry man! 




 User error, whoever did this didn't let the cake cool down before applying the icing.  




 BECAUSE DEMOCRATS DON'T FUCKING GET OUT AND VOTE.

(Or the states they're in pass abbottrary voter ID laws, gerrymander the districts, etc.) 




 That one time OP forgot a [SERIOUS] tag and fucked up the question.

 It's called an opinion.  




 We do. Dude is lame. 




 If you have to watch half of it for it to be good, then it isn't good. 




 Look, if the content takes a hit then the users will be okay with power users.   

It's the old kings conundrum. We try to 'rule' in favor of the majority. We have been having a lot of outcry about power users. We made a survey, we are listening to the voters, if they become unhappy with their decision, we can vote to change it back.

I just wanted to keep this democratic.  









 I knew a guy that was in the movies about racing cars. He died in a freak car accident.  




 0, it's just meme advertising.  




 Yeah, looks like reddit circlejerkers are displeased with our opinions. 




 I don't think he's ever been funny.  




 Thank you!!! I am glad that they are enjoyable!
