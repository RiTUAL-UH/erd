 I'm editing a multi-camera live concert video that was shot with a bunch of DSLRs and a BMCC. The BMCC has vastly superior image quality, but as the night goes on, it seems to have developed a dozen or more hot pixels that show up as white or coloured dots and are quite noticeable on a black background.

Any ideas on how to make them less noticeable? Thanks in advance guys! 









































































































































































 So we've been using sennheiser in ear monitors for the last 12 months or so, with the stock earbuds, and recently I had a chance to use the same radio pack and microphones with a set of shure earbuds. I didn't see what model they were, but they absolutely blew me away, the sound was just crystal. Full and clear. 

So as I hunt around for earbud options, I thought I'd consult the pros here - have you guys found nirvana in a stage earphone? What should I check out?

 




 An update to the thread I posted last week...

So today my band and I taped our Starking appearance. We sang with Girl's Day - at least, three of them, Minah must have known I'm dangerous and stayed away.

I never realized just how young those girls are - but they were totally charming, super professional and heaps of fun. Then we did a couple of songs with Brown Eyed Girls, who came across as... Sort of grumpy.

I don't know how our singing went, but we had an awesome time with the new hosts, Boom and Teuk (ex super junior) and it was a pretty damn hilarious day all up, once all the waiting around was out of the way. They seemed to think we kicked some butt, so who knows, it could lead us somewhere. :)

it's going to air in late November, I'll get a copy when I can and stick it on YouTube - but yeah, I thought you guys would appreciate what a crazy day I just had! :D 









 I sing with an Australian a cappella group, we're in Korea quite regularly, this will be our third visit this year. One of the things we love to incorporate in our show is bad imitations of k-pop songs, it's pretty funny since we're all guys.

Long story short, some TV producers saw us singing Twinkle Twinkle earlier this year and they've invited us to do a broadcast later this week.... And it seems like they're bringing Girl's Day in for the show as well. I have no idea what's going to happen, but I'm pretty sure it's going to be hilarious. :)

Wish us luck! 





































































 I've got a nice frontpage setup, but I like to see what's going on in the rest of the reddit world as well. Seeing as there's a few specific subreddits that are super popular but totally not of interest to me, is there any way to filter them out? 




 I've manually created a vignette effect (I know, I know) that I want to use on a dozen or so clips. I'm just dipping my toe into after effects, is it easy to save that adjustment layer and copy it across to the other clips, or am I missing the point? :) 




 I'm starting to shout at my telly now, having just come through the Vice section. The evidence is so weak and the questions so vague at this point of the game that you're more or less just guessing in interrogations. Even when you get questions right, you seem to get bugger-all in return. And it doesn't matter if you stuff every question up, the game goes on. It's like a movie in which you twiddle a thumbstick every now and then to get to the next scene.

The action is pretty ordinary and formulaic, the driving is both boring and unnecessary, the city has little in it that makes me want to explore further, the main character is a bit of a prat... Sure, the stories are great and the character animations fantastic - but the gameplay is so fucking irritating that I'd probably be happier if I left it alone and never finished it.

Next to Red Dead Redemption, this feels like a gimmicky vehicle for the awesome animation work of Team Bondi, a half way step towards future games that might put the technology to better use. But that might just be me. 














 I want to expand my abilities... Can you guys throw out some quick tips on how to make a project more visually interesting with the footage you've got? If you can point to any example videos I'd love to see them.  




 Sorry guys, beginner's question here: I'm working on a 25fps sequence using footage from 2 cameras - a Sony HDV camera and a Canon 7D. We've shot interviews and the like from 2 angles and want to be able to cut back and forth between vision from the two cameras - but it seems they shoot in slightly different frame rates.

If I create a 25fps sequence and just drop in the 23.975fps footage, does Premiere CS5 just sort frame rate issues out? Or do I need to process it somewhere else? Oh, and sorry if this is a stupid question! 









 Hey guys - just a quickie. I've been using prores transcoding in FCP, which does a great job of making 7D footage editable. Now I have to do a reasonably large project in CS5 - should I edit the 7D footage straight, or transcode it to something?

If I need to transcode it, can I do it using the Apple Compressor, or does Adobe have its own tool that works better? What format works best?

Cheers in advance! 














 Hey guys - thanks for the inspiration. I'm on day 2 of keto plus a few weeks into Starting Strength; I'm gonna be a total posterboy for reddit body transformation... heh heh. 

I'm struggling already though... The thought of greasy food for dinner again is making me a bit nauseous, plus I feel headachy and drained. Just checking in to make sure this is normal... Is it? 
























 Hi guys - and thanks for giving me the inspiration to get back to training after more than 10 years on my arse.

I went in and did my first squats, deads and press workout today, and ended up in a conversation with the guy running the place. I've got bad knees as a result of way too much basketball when I was younger, and I'm now carrying a lot of weight (~125kg) - getting my legs back in shape to support dodgy knees is the main reason SS appealed to me. I've been doing bodyweight broomstick squats at home for the last month or so.

The gym guy, an old fella who seems experienced in free weight training, is telling me I shouldn't jump straight into 5-rep heavy lifting in search of strength. That since I haven't been in a gym for 10 years I should spend at least a month doing low weights for 20-30 reps on things like leg extensions, unweighted or low weight bar squats and the like, in order to prepare my tendons and ligaments for the stress, that if not, I'm risking a blowout at the squat rack with severe consequences.

This seems to go against what Rippetoe says in SS - that the squat is not only the perfect conditioner of connective tissue, but that done properly, it shouldn't be dangerous. The way I read it, he seems to be saying learn the right forms and get straight into it. I'm confused... Help! 












































 So we're replacing a band member, and have found one strong candidate who seems to have a lot of the attributes we need - a rare combination. But his groove is non-existant - too much time in the classical world I think.

I've got time to spend with him if we decide he's our man, but I wonder what you guys' experiences are. Is groove innate or can it be trained? Will I be pushing shit uphill if I try to train him? And how would you go about it? Mixtapes? Metronomes? One-on-one sessions? 

Any ideas? 




















































































 Thought I'd bring this one up because it always tends to flush out a bunch of other wonderfully horrific stories about how other dudes lost THEIR knackers. 

SO:

I was lucky, because my nut started to hurt. In most cases, testicular cancer is absolutely painless, which lets it grow and spread to the lymph nodes, lungs and eventually the brain (which is the state it got to before Lance Armstrong did anything about it).

In my case, it was caught early because I'm a rabid motorcyclist and was learning to pull wheelies. When you're learning wheelies, you tend to smack the bike down and bash yourself in the nads a lot. The best guess of the docs is that weeks of testicular trauma due to mousetrapped wheelies had caused a minor bleed into a tumour that was growing in ol' righty. The bleed caused it to swell until the nut was twice its normal size, it hurt like a thousand bastards and I got it diagnosed. So it could be said that wheelies may have saved my life. Honestly, officer.

Apparently most cases of testicular cancer are discovered by the missus, in the bath. Or so I'm told.

The rest of the process was fairly simple. They chop out the diseased bollock (though it's not a simple case of cut the ol' scrotum and pull it out, they actually go in from your stomach, below your navel and off to the side, go figure), you go stash some wigglies at the sperm bank and then go for a short round of chemotherapy, which has a 50% chance of permanently sterilising you.

Chemo sucks, in my case it was just one IV bag of one chemical, carboplatin, which is so toxic that the nurse carries it in wearing elbow-length gloves. A nice touch. The treatment took 45 minutes, after which I had to go sing a gig. That was interesting. It left me with no appetite or energy for weeks, and for the next 3-4 years I felt kind of foggy in the head, as if I was thinking through cotton wool. I can only imagine things are worse for people who have to go through longer treatments - Armstrong is a good example, he had to have five or six, the poor bugger. With just one treatment, I didn't even lose any hair.

Anyway, I didn't find the process overly scary, and apart from the annoying effects of chemo, I can honestly say that one nut works just as well as two (the missus tested it out just hours after surgery). Looks a bit odd, mind you, but then the frank 'n' beans have never struck me as particularly pleasing to look at, even in the best of times.

So hopefully if there's anyone out there that's just copped a nasty shock, found a lump or had a diagnosis, I can reassure you a bit. There's plenty of blog posts, articles and whatnot on the net where fellas make a big deal out of losing one ball, what it means to their manhood, and generally make it sound very scary. It doesn't have to be, though, and your life will go on just fine. The guy at [www.mybollox.com](www.mybollox.com) has a pretty healthy attitude about it all (and incidentally, the same doctor as I had).

As for the rest of you, if this post gets you to fondle your nuts or the nuts of somebody you care about, I'd consider that a win for everyone. Even if you don't find anything.

Fire away! 







































 I'll be doing up a full review in time, perhaps a video review too - but since this is such a breakthrough bike, arguably one of the two most fascinating superbikes of 2010 alongside the S1000R, I thought you motoreddit folk might have some questions. So if you do, ask away! 


































 I know what you want to say, and I know you're struggling to get it out, and I know YOU know I know. What I don't know is whether it's ruder for me to finish the sentence for you so we can move on, or to wait for you to finish and let you hang out there because I don't want to talk over you... 

So, uh, whaddya reckon, should I finish your sentences? 

















































 He might come in very handy as an Oden remedy.  




 FUCK THESE FUCKING CUNTS
 




 11 in the morning here in Melbourne, Australia. Dunno what you're all complaining about. :P
 




 Heeheehee 




 Sure, but it was IMPLIED. 




 Highlights: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsvBg9UQXus

You know, looking back on it, there were some great dunks but the competition itself has always been a joke. Nique's two handed windmill with his head over the rim scores 45 and Jordan gets a 50 for the same dunk he did in the semi round? C'mooonnnn. As a kid this was a really huge thing, but looking at it now, I kind of understand why the name players wouldn't bother with it. 









 I'll give YOU two wet balls in a minute. 









 Vince, MJ and Dominique Wilkins were absolute highlight factories, but there's no argument in my mind that Carter is the best dunker that's ever played in the NBA. 




 'Knoaf mate 




 But you have the athletic trainer of the year up there!  




 I think this serves an important purpose.  




 Dummies would be spat. 




 Gold is a nice way of spreading a bit of joy while supporting the website. Best thing to do is to pay it forward... Here ya go! :P 




 http://assets.dogtime.com/asset/image/4f967276eadf725ead000500/column_dog-picture-photo-puppy-growl.jpg 




 I feel like the Hawks should take this one as a moral victory. Durant made a huge shot at the end, but it was immediately preceded by a bitch-ass push off no call and a rip-through. I reckon we should be able to expect more from KD.

I wanted OKC to win, but... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avr7enrZuJQ

Hawks' offense made a fool of the Thunder through the first 3 quarters, every basket seemed like an easy one, where the Thunder were struggling to get shots off and making some really tough looks. GG Hawks. 




 Blockrates?!? Hahaha!
 




 Plenty of post but it's also a great lens, I bet it's the 135 f/2 L.  




 I thought the same thing, but we did a cheap-arse wedding and it turned out to be one of the best days of my life.  




 For me, yeah. But that's because my camera only had one good autofocus point in the center there and I don't trust the others.  




 I think it might also help to use a fisheye lens or another ultra wide, then you can exaggerate the painted flowers and give the sense of being right behind the canvas instead of looking from a few feet away.  




 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z201YXJX3c0 




 It's called a go360. Here's me being a dickhead reviewing one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z201YXJX3c0 




 Doesn't show a lot of class going off for 70 on one of the worst teams in history in a total blowout. Then again, there was bugger-all else interesting about that game. 




 I dunno. He's not real flash at making in-game adjustments, but he's astonishing in between playoff games at taking away an advantage. 




 Well woop de doo. 




 "War is bad. It makes me sad."

- Melo's sole contribution to his University history class. 




 DMC stood on Paul's foot as he was trying to turn and run. 




 Everybody just wants somebody to beat the fucking heat.  




 Slim reapist? 









 He missed that free throw just to fuck with you. 




 It just occurred to me to check what the record for consecutive 30-point games was... Yyyyyeah, Wilt with sixty-fuckin'-five. Dayumn. 




 Amazing figures, considering how shittily he started the 4th quarter.  




 To me it doesn't look like it's quite stopped rising. 




 Good games for their time, but I think the ship has sailed. 




 Really? I think he comes across as a thoughtful, warm, stand-up guy. 




 Then again, I've heard it said that if you get a hold of somebody's chinpiece you can 'make their head go wherever you want it to. ' 




 Aussie here - I never picked a team, I just like keeping an eye on the league as a whole and catching as many games as I can from the teams that are doing awesome stuff at any given time. 




 I think it's actually a positive, kinda like Pop making sure the Heat don't get a look at the full squad before crunch time. 




 Since the Heat beat OKC in the finals, they always seem to be in the Thunder's heads. Maybe this is the year they turn that #2 self-perception on its head. 




 Also not to mention he scored a career high on Iguodala, one of the best wing defenders in the game. 




 On the other hand, as well as KD is playing, the OKC offense has long periods of total suckage. No movement, no plan, just give it to the Reaper and hope he can do something cool. I wouldn't be surprised if the Spurs take it comfortably, even if Kawhi ends up with a KD scrotum-print on his eye sockets. 




 That's not language. Get with the times! 




 What about making video players marginally less stupid so they can play the video vertically?  




 His hook shots have been money lately. 




 I think you're right, he's got one of the biggest verticals I've ever seen and he has a lot of style and flair. Although Blake and DeAndre occasionally unleash those giant destructo-dunks that are even more exciting. What Blake did to Pau, foul or not, was two of the best dunks I ever saw. 




 Ah righto. 




 Because LeBron denies that he's slacking off, maybe he's just running low on energy. 




 Why would he be angry at Deng? It's not like he had a say in the matter.  




 I like your new adjective there. PG got all dunkier-than-thou on the Clips. 




 Heh heh yeah been there - missus not impressed. But that only happens once or twice, after that the adage holds! 




 Looks like a decent rider stuffing around to me. No such thing as an unintentional wheelie. 




 Pacers forgot how to miss... 




 This should be a ripper game. I'm thinking pacers by 10 though. 




 But who the fuck understands the theory behind a pop hit? It doesn't matter. 




 Kids can emotionally connect with music without intellectually understanding it. Try that with your Dostoyevski.  




 Funny that so many cartoons use classical soundtracks. How can we expect kids to understand that?  




 Whaaaaaat? 




 ...scrogged.  




 It looks a bit... Fallen off of. I think you've just munted your resale value - and let's face it, this is a learner bike, you're gonna want to sell it within a couple of years. 




 Awwwwww! That's sweet! 




 YO MOMMA ATE THEM
 




 No way - no two guys move the same way in the air. Look at MJ's dunk contest efforts, there was nothing formulaic about those yet they just looked so damn good in slo-mo. 




 No way, he was saying in the lead-up to the contest that he had 4 dunks prepared that nobody had ever seen before. It wasn't improvised. 




 Nature's *other* dental floss. 




 It was always dogmatix here in Australia when I was a kid.  




 'Tis a bag of wank, sir! 'Tis not for riding. 




 Well you sure told them. 




 Nothing out of the ordinary. 




 Man, I LOVE the countryside, I spend hours just jumping dirt bikes in the mountains. Go play GTAIV if you want to be stuck in a big, grotty city. 




 YOU'RE A CUNT. 

Oh, sorry, are we starting yet?  




 I read somewhere that the uncle had been involved in price collusion with the Chinese over some NK business deals too... 




 You start with the body - tall, lean, strong. Unbelievable athleticism, the league had never really seen anybody who could just hang in the air so long. Watch the old game tapes, Jordan would elevate for a shot, wait for the defenders to drop out of the air, then shoot right over the top, have a coffee and come down. His hands were gigantic too, he could palm the ball at will, giving him amazing control on the dribble, or in the air, or grabbing steals. And his speed was absolutely stunning, in the open court he had an extra gear that nobody could keep up with. 90% of the time he looked like a coiled spring, running conservatively, but then he'd explode and it was amazing to watch.

Then there was the offensive skills - his touch was absolutely ridiculous, nobody has ever come close. He'd make layups the league has still never seen again, changing his mind two or three times in the air and kissing it in with a little spin off the backboard. His post game was just unreal to watch, that turnaround fadeaway was so deadly. He was an absolutely electric scorer, if the ball was in MJ's hands something amazing could happen at any second. Excellent vision, too, finding teammates or punishing a sloppy double - and if he got a sniff of the rim, he'd rise up and posterize ANYBODY in his way.

You could talk about defense - that sprung from his ridiculous motor. The guy was just ON all the time, an absolute energy factory and there were rumours he'd party all night and turn up and still demolish you. He was a constant threat on defense, not just on his own man, but a demon in the passing lanes for steals and most games he'd have one or two out-of-nowhere flying blocks as well. 

The competitive spirit and iron will just burned in him, he was the ultimate win-at-all-costs psychopath, to the point where it almost looks like it's ruining his life after basketball. He took *everything* personally, in fact if there was the tiniest reason to get pissed off with somebody, he'd make it his mission to destroy and humiliate them, and more often than not, these were his best games. Having said that, he never took a game off. You see LeBron and the heat coasting during the regular season - that would never happen on a Bulls squad, they just had a fire inside. 72 wins in one regular season is evidence of that.

And on top of all this and his many other gifts, he was also the most stylish player ever to take the court. Everything he did just looked so damn beautiful and in control. He was loose and fluid, but incredibly strong and athletic at the same time. If you played ball in the 80s and 90s, you'd see so much of MJ's style in the other kids - tongues out, scoop reverse layups, jumpman leg splits, people just wanted to be him. It sure didn't hurt that his Nike PR team concealed what a knob he was from the public so impeccably. 

So yeah - perfect storm. Outstanding physical gifts, unparalleled drive to improve and win, smart, skilled, creative, unstoppable and more marketable than pretty much anything the world has seen since. 




 Ah, you never know. Some people respond to Kobe's glaring style of motivation, others would absolutely hate it. 




 Yeah good call. The old one had much nicer colour and contrast than my 24-105, but it was just useless indoors. Blew me away how blurry every shot was. 




 Canon 5D3 lets you do it in-camera, hence a rash of similar pictures when that camera launched.
 




 Canon 24-70 f/2.8 - I haven't tried the new one, but I had the old one for a year and hated it. Lack of IS really killed it in the low light situations I expected it to shine in. 




 Canon 135mm f/2L. 




 Perhaps the balls dropped? 




 There's a difference between really bad and just completely destroyed by injuries. Bad luck has played a big part, the team was performing above expectations before everyone got carted away in the meat wagon.

 




 He should be there for sure, he's an absolute highlight machine. 




 Plus, y'know, proximity of teeth to balls.  




 Wow. 

If you were a boy scout I'd hand you an advanced turd polishing badge. That is very impressive.  




 Right on, it's no kind of path to peace or happiness. After all, what's the ultimate goal? 




 Forget variable NDs, they're garbage. 




 He acts like a child throwing a tanty. 




 Jesus, what a loser. 




 What's this from? 




 Haha I wrote about this a couple years ago, they're fasscinating! Couple of amazing videos of them at work too: http://www.gizmag.com/nuclear-icebreakers-double-acting-ships-azipods/20903/ 




 I think it's more than that. I think the US relies on massive military spending for such a huge chunk of its economy that it's become addicted to war. The country has deliberately stayed in constant conflict since WW2. Drop that spending and the country would be thrown back into depression.  




 *shudder*

Dude think of it this way: a new chain and sprockets makes the motor and gearbox feel amazing. I change my chains a bit more often than is strictly necessary just 'coz I love the feel of a fresh set.  




 You. You are a bad person.  




 I agree on both those counts, but he also comes off as a total knob end. 




 Yeah, now that you mention it. Aussie here and I reckon Bogut looks like a proper bastard.  




 Not only the initial impact, but the two jagged ends of each bone snagging and pinching all the muscle and tendon as the foot dangles freely. Ugh.  




 "Whoooo, a little more choke and that would've started! " 




 "Better an empty flat than a bad tenant..." 




 I'm not sure that's a bad thing. Aussie drinking culture is pretty gross. Source: ex-piskarn.  




 Unwatchable. 




 It sure seems like every couple of days another great player goes down. Anybody keeping a list? Is there any way to compare this season to others in terms of which seasons have been most impacted by high profile player injuries? 

























































































 Ride one. Ride this one, then tell me how joyless it is! I was blown away. 




 Wait til ya ride one. I love me some dinosaur burners, but this was one of the most exciting things I've ridden in years. 









 Yeah but it's more like 'yes sweep til Brooklyn.' 




 Ctrl-F "stromile"

All is in order, thank you. 




 Haha bring it on! My brother and I did an hour long dick song show last year. It's a labour of love. Get her to link me done tunes! 




 Please show this to your daughter, I feel we may be kindred spirits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-QtWWZiQzo 




 Reporting for duty, where do I queue? 




 Green skinned Aussie here, can confirm.  




 Thunder would appear to have the edge, but dare I say DeAndre Jordan might be a big factor? Dude is acting like a 7 foot Rodman lately. 




 What they need is a coach who can better utilize Howard and Lin in a pick and roll offense. I hear D'Antoni is available. 




 Oh, I dunno, because he was playing like a sack of shit all series? 




 Not to mention, KD had been shooting like absolute faeces for the entire game, missing just about everything. 




 I gotta say it, Durant has looked like a piece of shit in this series.  




 That... That's actually pretty fantastic. 




 I choose not to be dragged down by the cynicism of this video. Instead I shall marvel at the gorgeous camerawork and sweet editing. 




 You smoke flavoured tobacco in those things for like 45 minutes at a time. I can't believe that wouldn't make a big difference to your energy levels in an overtime game. 




 /r/asmr ;) 




 I think it's more likely to go fungal, but we'll see! 




 Fair call. Unfortunately lyrics and melody are very tired together for me. Maybe this is just my dick period.  




 http://m.soundcloud.com/wrongtown-brothers/one-little-person ;) 




 I'm amazed I got the "honeymooner's choice" line past my editor in the Multistrada one... :P 




 Close - just north of Melbourne, Australia. 




 Not the missus, but one of her friends. I've banned the missus from getting on the back, she fell asleep in the twisties a couple of times and my ego couldn't take it. :P 




 She's fine. But yeah, I don't think she's real keen to get back on again. She had no idea when it happened, but when she saw the tape, she nearly crapped herself. 




 Cheers mate! We're going to get back into them in the next few months. :) 




 Aye, it looks tight as a motherfucker. Is that how the drag guys run them? 




 They made some absolutely shithouse chemistry moves when they dealt Granger and picked up Turner and Bynum. Heart and soul got replaced by a pair of me-first bastards. 




 Dwight and Lopez look weirdly uncoordinated on offense. Dwight's hook looks so stiff and strange.  




 *dominant 




 There's been a few similar threads on Reddit with people admitting they've got the attraction and are trying like hell never to act on it. What a tough hand to be dealt. 




 He also works his arse off, to be fair.  




 Ya mean white balance? 




 I feel like there's an equivalent Austin Powers gif just waiting to get made. 




 There were sure some amazing characters back then. Gods like Jordan, villains like Laimbeer, and a complete alien like Rodman the likes of which we won't see again.  




 Well, they still dribble up and down the court, so I'd like to see that included. 




 What a great video! 




 I dunno, he seems like a nice guy, but a total clown. A lot like Dwight Howard in that regard.  




 Wishful thinking I reckon. Consistency ain't his game.  




 Those things are pure horn in the metal. 




 That is some serious skill. Not a great bike for doing stoppies on, and he's just owning it! 




 Refurbished macbook pro?  









 Greatest that ever lived. 




 Durant looked very ordinary out there for most of that game. Almost seemed like he was pushing to get to his 25 points. 




 That's the problem here - the Spurs have a better chance of beating the Heat. Just let 'em through already. 




 I've taken pairs of tyres to the shop like that. Gotta plan ahead a bit in traffic! A mate then asked how to move a tyre I was giving him, and I told him to put his arms up and slip it over his head. Had him stuck like that for about 5 minutes while I rolled around laughing. Pro tip: stand in the tyre and pull it up around your waist! 




 As an Aussie, it's absolutely worthy of comment. Any sports stars over here that behaved like that would be treated with the kind of scorn Americans seem to reserve for Justin Bieber. 




 Metta's Champions thing was alright. Is he "active?"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjEUAtEisc4 




 Or are they just really missing Granger? 




 I'd agree with this. If you've got the time and skills to grade all your footage, then go ahead and shoot cinestyle. But it adds time to the process, and unless you know what you're doing, it actually makes the footage look worse than standard. I've gone back to shooting a lot of my stuff on standard because clients can't tell the difference and it's heaps quicker. 




 Well will ya look at that date! 




 It's the ring of faeeeeeceeeees... 




 I had a hornet 919 years ago, ripping bike, loved it. Might even prefer it to the FZS1000 at the end of the day! But ya gotta run what ya brung as they say!  




 Yep, the 2002. Need to keep it revving like mad to keep up with the big twins I'm chasing! Could do with some bottom end.  









 They absolutely fucked that piece of road up.  




 I dunno... Show me the data.  




 Barkley was an energy-filled hate machine of intimidation. He went hard as a motherfucker with full intensity on every play. 




 Bought it. Watched it. It's got a few moments but it's not awesome.  




 Dear god. 




 Can you say that five times fast?  




 My theory is that people see crystal clear photos and don't have the emotional response that they get from old photos. A lot of stylistic processing emulates the problems inherent in shit cameras, old film or old photos and that resonates with people's desire to reminisce. It gives the photos a kind of aged credibility. It's odd.  




 That's the "Chuck a Wheelie" signal.  




 WHOSE GAME IS IT? IT'S MICHAEL JORDAN'S GAME!  




 WITHOUT THE BASKETBAAAAALLLLL 




 Nigga on, if that's what gets you through the day. 




 Be... cause I didn't see that?  :P 









 Here, I knocked this up. Hope it helps!

 OK I'll put something together. 




 Honestly the bars and big eyes make it look a bit like a sad elephant. But I bet it's nicer to ride already.  




 Let's not forget, whichever porn star he chooses to rail will be made well aware that he's the slut shaming asshole that outed one of their colleagues. It will not go well for him.  




 YOU FOOL. YOU WILL KILL THIS SUBREDDIT WITH TALK LIKE THAT!  




 It's incredibly easy, super intuitive and extremely fast - even faster when you're dealing with a stack of shots. There's still things that PS is handy for, but LR absolutely shits on it for file handling, choosing your keepers, getting a basic look, doing your crops, etc etc etc. 




 And the league and the ticket buying public can't be sure one team or the other's just not going to bring half their squad. Pop reaps what he sows. 




 On my mobile right now but it's pretty intuitive. It's under lens corrections/color.  




 The primes give the best looking photos, but I can't get by without my 24-105. I probably take 90% of my shots with it. 




 It's a brilliant lens but pretty limited in scope. Probably makes my favourite images, but I'm not gonna take it out on a walk around! 




 Lightroom kills CA very effectively, you can spend a little tie and make absolutely sure you've got rid of it on your keepers. 




 Mine too. It flies.  




 Appreciated! (I think I've fucked it) :) 




 I've always thought he was a straight up knob. 




 Why's that?  




 Symptoms are as follows: Lens seems to work normally at 24mm, but as you zoom in, the IS and aperture start to jump around wildly. I believe this is an issue with the flexible communications ribbon that connects to the aperture control ring. Canon Australia wants $480 to repair it... That's ludicrous, especially given that you can get a whole new lens for $700 in some places.

I've found a second hand aperture ring with a new ribbon soldered on and I want to have a crack at making the repair, but I understand it's easy to knock certain lens elements out of alignment in the process. Has anyone opened one of these lenses up, and do you have any tips for me? 




 Old fixer upper motorcycle. 




 Mirror? 




 Anyone ever yells that at you, I got bad news for ya. Or good news, depending... 




 That was great! 




 What about "I'm... We're..." and "As if you'd ever take responsibility for something!"

 




 Penis. 




 Wow. :) 




 Sweet baby jesus that was good.  




 Nice shot... I assume you've got in and cropped it as straight as you can, and fiddled with the distortion controls? If so, you might need to fire this one into Photoshop and play with the skew or perspective tools. 




 You guys woulda held on if it wasn't for the okc defense though. That 12-0 run had a stack of forced turnovers in it.  




 Just chuck it in and go! FCPX is awesome with DSLR video.

 HGGGGNNNNNNNGGGGGHHHHH

*spaff*

Two, please. One with a flat bar. 




 A vow of positivity... I should look into that, I'm a grumpy cunt. 




 I'd go a step further and name him as the greatest single sportsman of the modern era. Better and more transcendent than Rossi, Federer, Schumacher, Tiger, Beckham... Maybe there's an argument for Wayne Gretzky, but ice hockey is a much less global sport than basketball.

Good god. 




 Funny how these things keep showing up around dunk contest time. 




 All this "I'm not doing the dunk contest, but look at me anyway" stuff is bullshit. Put up or shut up. 




 Yeah but it sort of fell flat. 




 I remember MJ saying something that really resonated with me - something along the lines that every night, there was some kid up in the stands who was only ever going to get one chance to see him play. He said he played every night for that kid, so he could never take a night off. 




 And yet look at who the heat lose to. 




 Similar to the way LeBron's regular season coasting will tarnish his legacy. 




 I can tell you I got the Canon 135 recently and it's an absolute ripper. Sharp, separates the background beautifully and focuses very fast. And half the price.  




 For sure, but if your auto focus system is losing you shots and getting you into trouble with clients... 




 Except... Most of those are deeply ordinary pictures, I see nothing that makes me want to give up my DSLR.  




 Yes, but he had that whole thing going where he sort of loped about at half pace, keeping up with everyone, and then exploded when he wanted to. Extraordinary motor. 




 Fucking hell, it feels like Stern had been on his last couple of days for about two years!  




 YEAH IT WAS ABOUT TIME SOMEBODY TOOK BENNETT DOWN A PEG. 




 It's a beast unless she shoots fast action stuff, in which case it's only awesome. 




 So much can happen though. KD could snap like a twig in a winning WCF game 7. You've got to be in it to win it, and the pathetic East more or less hands the ECF to Miami with only one decent team in the way.  
























 Dominique Wilkins. The guy had heart, and he dunked like he wanted to throw his whole body through the rim.  




 They're both in 'motor valley' about half an hour out of Bologna. Basically, if you're a petrolhead and you're in the region, it's a must-visit destination. Ducati, Moto Guzzi, Ferrari, Lamborghini etc etc... This is no big deal. 




 He does come off as a bit of a knob to the casual viewer.  




 There can be only one. 




 Len Bias? 




 Sure ain't going to be a team that places emphasis on character. The guy's a fool.  




 A black guy, clearly.

 At 12 mm on a full frame, you can almost see behind yourself. In the wedding shot I would have looked like I was right in their faces, no more than a couple feet away. It can be a really cool effect but it feels incredibly rude to shoot this way!

 Man, a Kurt Rambis basketball card was always the best shitty one to get in your pack. Those glasses... That moustache... I almost couldn't believe he was a real person.

http://d1warraxuf7xh1.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/act_kurt_rambis.jpg 




 His sources were probably executives that were worried about the foot. He didn't report that the foot was fucked, he just said it was an issue with various executives. Both sides could be right on this one.  




 Yeah I kind of had it in my head that he was old, tired and flogged out. I guess not! 




 You'd have to include Oden then.  




 I've had the fuckers draw level with me at 80kmh.  




 Pessimistically confident.  




 It was probably all the #thereturn crap. Hold the guy up as basketball Jesus and there's bound to be a backlash. 




 Ahhhh shit, the poor bastard. His wave was just about to break. 




 Can't see that happening. Wade is part of the furniture.  




 Don't you have something better to do?  




 Motorcycle sales would rocket.  




 I dunno about that. Pop has said he's gonna retire the day Timmy does.  




 Small ball and the trap defense worked for a particular lineup of guys - Miami is rebuilding from scratch now, so I'd presume their style of play will change depending on who they sign. 




 Keep one of these under your seat: http://www.ebay.com.au/itm/Safety-Car-Bike-Auto-Tubeless-Tire-Tyre-Puncture-Plug-Repair-Cement-Tool-Kit-/291047728863?_trksid=p2054897.l5660

You can also get miniature air compressors. I use them heaps - as often on my mates' bikes/cars as on my own. 




 Hornet 919 was one of the best all-round bikes I ever owned. I miss it heaps. It fit me like a glove and did everything - touring, stunting, track days, commuting, great for passengers, the lot. 

I haven't ridden the FZ09 yet - it's on the list - but you can pick those old Hornets up super cheap in my part of town and I'm forever looking at them in the paper and going "hmmmmm..."

The Speed Triple, if you can stretch for one of those, is the [best bike in the whole world ever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDNrRX6EzWA). 




 I thought it was called a four-play.  




 Dude that was one of the all time greatest highlights I've ever seen. And it came right after another insane putback slam. I feel for Pau and all but those made me jump out of my seat.  




 Because if they're paid what they're worth, they'll lose again.  




 That was more or less me 15 years ago. Funny thing is, the muscle memory of all those thousands of hours hasn't gone away. I don't shoot hoops for years at a time but I can step right up and hit 8 for 10 free throws. 

Anyway, I feel for ya but there's a big wide world of other stuff out there. Motorcycles filled the gap for me.  




 Yeah they're tops! I'm just trying to arrange a test unit, the SMH10 and 10R turned me back on to riding with headsets. 




 On my high school team we had one guy who could dunk, and it was a big deal. 




 It was that or Drew Peacock. I just wanted a penis name.  




 He was an unstoppable offensive rebounder when MyPlayer Dick Harden got drafted to Dallas.  




 I dunno, surely it's a severe dose of short-man complex that makes him the ferocious competitor he is... 




 I kinda have a bad feeling about it. A kind of cancery feeling. The Bulls' success has been built on heart, effort and hard work. I'm not sure you can plug a me-first guy into that and not kill it.   




 At least she's not called La La. 




 Yup that's me. 1198 isn't the worst bike I've ridden around town - I've been riding the new Buell lately and that takes that dubious honor. But the s1000rr is as smooth as butter. If you want a bike that can be Clark Kent as well as superman, it's gotta be the Beemer. Doesn't look as nice but test ride both and the difference will be obvious.  




 Went up there with a car and a bike a few months ago. 3 nails in the bike rear tyre, one in the car tyre. What the hell is that all about?  




 The amount of seriously dicey u-turns I've done on windy roads durung tests... *shudder* 




 Fucken lot of work eh. I'm ashamed to say it but the farty noises in your oil change vid made me giggle like a school girl.  




 Lightning is about to release something that will shit on every bike on the road. Fastest production bike ever.  




 That team could be the most punchable collection of faces in history.  




 And bow legged. 




 The leftist party wasn't left enough for the southern States, plus they'd just made cunts of themselves. Abbott won by keeping his mouth shut. And he's probably still got loads of support, just not from people who can use the Internet.  




 Jordan has become a real heart and soul player in the last 2 years. I'd be very sad to see him go.  




 That's absolutely stunning footage for a 21 year old sports broadcast. Crystal clear... And so many cameras - they had just as many on the reverse side. Clearly knew they were filming a once in a lifetime athlete.  




 Certainly the best correction of athletes - not sure it really lived up to its potential though.  




 Bron needs his hand held and Wade needs to feel like he's still relevant?

Edit: I think it's more like Bron throwing Wade a bone. 




 PJ3 played some really good ball while Westbrook was out. Sad to see him ride the bench in the playoffs. 




 I've been lucky enough to ride a ton of bikes, and the best by a mile was the Speed Triple. No question.  




 DONGGGGGG 




 I had the chance to sit down with Randy Mamola once a few years ago and ask about this stuff. He told me that an engine part made for Rossi might cost 3 times as much as the one on Lorenzo's bike. There's a huge difference again between that and the satellite bikes.  




 Hard to beat Wade in hateability.  




 I want total humiliation.  




 They should let Bron do interviews without Wade there to hold his hand.  




 Condolences in your last two decades.  




 Bulls with Melo and Rose might be able to knock the heat off, especially if they bring the chump game we've seen the last two times out.  




 The Poo Game (tm)
 




 Plus, he takes an arse-kicking like a champ. 




 I think it's great. As often as not, it takes a special kind of psychopath to become rich enough to own an NBA team. Hang 'em high if they've been pricks. 




 No way - the Spurs first half offense has been blowing everyone away. Mind you, so has the Heat's shitty D. 




 That Heat uniform is the wrong colour to be shitting yourself in. 




 Then again, Melo might look at the way Bosh has gone from being the Man to playing third and fourth fiddle. 




 So much skill, such a finely tuned human being, erased in an instant after what was probably a tiny error. Vale Bob Price. 









 You and I could work as hard as we wanted and not end up with his size, strength or bounce. Even among NBA athletes, most of whom work like bastards, he's an outlier.

Edit: missed your point entirely, play on! 




 A lot of uncharacteristic turnovers. Much as I want Miami to lose, I don't think we'll see that kind of effort again. 




 Winning genetic lotteries? 




 All those chats are played through the in house PA. 




 I make a point of blurring the speedo in anything I put up anywhere. No need for John Q. Law to have any reason to come after you, no need for anyone who knows the road to be looking at what your corner speeds are - whether it's higher or lower than theirs, little good can come of it. 




 He's an ignoranus.  




 This can go back and forth all day. You've got your opinion, I've told you mine. Great player, bullshit situation and I don't have to be impressed by it.  




 Took his legacy in his hands by teaming up with two of his biggest competitors in the east and taking a pay cut to prevent the salary cap from maintaining competitive balance. Clearly it worked a treat, and plenty of people jump on board when you start winning.  




 I have plenty of respect for LeBron's game, but fuck the Miami superteam. It's a pussy's path to a ring.  




 If everybody you meet seems to be an arsehole, you're probably the arsehole.  




 Those dunks at the end... Lad's got some anger to get out.  




 Outlaw gangs are very real and very serious.  




 You know, it's kind of possible.  




 The leap to side-sitting on the tank at 2:15 made me laugh out loud in joy and disbelief. Beast! 




 So... What sound does a cockenballs make?  




 Garn then, show us!  




 Wow. I can't remember ever seeing somebody get thrown so high.  




 He's handling garbage most of the time.  




 "Cupcake?" 




 Me too! Excellent cheap hobby.  




 I've got some 5-driver Westone jobs. I use then for onstage in-ear monitors. Having said that, I think they're total overkill even for that. I reckon most any molded earpieces would do the job.  




 Lance Stephenson:

 Well he does seem like a bit of a cunt.

 Right with ya mate, not naked enough. 




 About the same as good noise cancellers.  




 I thought the sennheiser noise canceling cans were pretty good, until I started taking a set of molded earphones on the plane with me. They're tons better, you can listen to stuff on the lowest volume setting. Lets your brain relax.  




 Interesting point. I guess we'll see.  




 How much of that was flat top?  




 I don't think it's cool for you to broadcast that offer Glidecam extended you. 




 Agreed. It was so good, it made me like a Nickelback song.  




 Right - not to mention how deflating it is to your sense of self belief to take on the best team in the league without your #3 offensive option and best defender. OKC plays on emotion, this is a killer.

Also, fuck the heat. 




 Onya dad! :) 




 Won a stack of road races too, Angel Nieto rode Bultaco in the 70s. But more recently they've been known as off-road and trials 2-strokers. 




 ...but you've only got one arse to put on them! 




 Nothing about OKC's stagnant, iso-heavy offence convinced me they'd beat the spurs even when Ibaka was healthy. Ibaka is their most important defensive asset and their #3 option at the other end. They might get a win or two but I think they're finished, especially since the Spurs have a great defender to put on KD, and home court advantage to boot. 




 Top level racers are by no means normal people.  




 Regular season records don't count if your team is coasting like a bitch.  




 Agreed. Source: will never shut up about hating this chequebook superteam.  




 They were all pathetic. And he should die in a fire. 




 But it's basically totally comprised of wrinkles! 




 This is only true of some people's spit. But when you find someone with just the right loogies, you hang on with both hands.  
























 All depends on how far you can see.

 You wouldn't change gears there though would you? I mean, you ride first for a bit before hooking second.

 Yes sir! Well spotted. 




 Lake Mountain, VIC. Get into it!  




 That's stunning slow mo! I wanna know why the extra clutch grab once the bike was already up - that's odd. Watching what happens on the throttle side is pretty scary too.  




 Lucky man. Last time a chain snapped on me it whipped up, beheaded an indicator, chainsawed the ducktail and made a bit of a mess inside the sprocket cover. I had a passenger on too, thank christ the chain guard did its job.  




 Heh heh can't be too careful eh! Anyway, I'm the guy in front on the grandpa bike.

 What about those of us who think it plays directly into the hands of the enemy? It's what these pricks have been begging for all along. 




 If you go out trying to be a dick to people, and people say "you're being a dick" you shouldn't act all surprised. OP baited christians and reeled one in, of course he's being disrespectful. That was the point all along.  




 My point is whoever made the sticker knew they were being disrespectful, as did the person that stuck it on their car. There's no reason to have it if you're not baiting.  




 These days, just something some christians stick on their cars.  




 Why would you get that sticker if you weren't being disrespectful? It's a Jesus fish with a different god in it.  It's designed to be disrespectful.  




 It was a beautiful reminder of our mortality and how fleeting youth and beauty can be. I watched it on the shitter and shed a tear while wiping my butt. That was an odd experience.  




 Indeed. Could have cut down on the wank factor.  




 99% invisible steps into those areas occasionally and is otherwise pretty beaut.  




 That and it made my penis go numb.  




 Hahaha indeed! 




 No point in doing reviews if you can't find a way to have a whinge. That's why I've gotta stop doing superbikes, what the hell can your average mug like me say about those things?   









 Told me? I was official scorekeeper! 




 My brother managed 10 times in 2 hours the first time he tried ecstasy.  




 Tough luck pac-man. You're eating the brown pills today.  




 It's a joke that reveals what you think about the situation.  




 You are blaming the victim, that's exactly what you're doing. Heaps of people take naked pictures of themselves, for whatever reason, and that's their business, and if they fuck up and put it in the wrong place that's their fault. If somebody steals them from a place they believe is secure, that's another entirely. They probably had no idea that their stuff was going to the cloud. It's all automatic.  




 They're a really nice little bike. Engine from the days when you didn't have to rev the piss out of them. Would make a good stunter. Have fun!

 Good for quick cheap prototyping and full color models. The results can be hardened to a pretty solid form by soaking in some sort of glue. Stuff that isn't post treated in this way can start flaking in the finicky bits. But yeah, very cheap as they use regular 80gsm paper.  




 Wow, I never realised he was no jive-talkin' wigger. 




 Holy shit, different suspension for front and rear? Where do I sign? 




 Cleveland: the new Heatles. I was ready to get behind LeBron, but superteams are just icky. 




 As a motorcyclist, it's extraordinary just how much you can feel the difference when you get right up the bum of a truck. I've used it as a technique to squeeze the last few miles out of a low fuel warning, you need almost no power once you're in the draft.

Having said that, I've been playing with an adaptive cruise system lately in a test car, and that seems significantly less fuel efficient than the way I'd drive if I was operating the pedals. It slows down and speeds up quite aggressively to maintain the distance you choose from the car in front. I'd guess that early self driving cars, before they begin talking to one another, will be less energy efficient than fuel-conscious human drivers. 




 The fountain of youth... I think that's what happens when we try to change his nappy. 









 I dunno where in the world you are, but it's generally about as much as a Panigale.  




 The EBR possibly steers and handles a touch quicker, it's very enjoyable in corners. The BMW has a more flexible and more powerful engine, but it's a total computer bike and something like 33% of them have reliability issues, is what I'm reading. They've all got their individual character that will speak to different riders.  




 But... But I wasn't! I was saying it's a better all-rounder!  




 End of the day, Erik wants to be in that top 3, and he wants to race at the highest level.  




 The SX is basically exactly the same bike with the plastics off. Same gearing, same power, same torque and yep, same clutch. Better start working your forearm muscles!  




 Well cheers mate. I did a vid on your bike too, couple years back: Ducati Multistrada 1200 S Review: http://youtu.be/zyZ64Ef-yaY 




 On the bike, it's a Sena 20S headset (SMH10 would be almost as good and cheaper), through a GP10 backpack thingy for the GoPro. Wind noise is cancelled to virtually zero, and the audio is synced straight up with the vision. You can also record intercom conversations if you're out with multiple riders.

It's a great motovlogging setup, being able to talk on the bike means I don't have to shoot nearly as much footage off the bike as I used to - so I'm less reliant on having a cameraman around!

More info: http://www.gizmag.com/sena-20s-video-review/33093/ 




 Haha bush mechanics FTW! 




 That's fine in theory - but I'd say looks play a big part in the majority of bike buying decisions, like it or not! 









 Cheers! I'm gonna get a sleep study done in the next couple weeks. Thanks for the feedback.
 




 Hey there - I'm sleeping like shit and starting to investigate the idea of a CPAP machine too. What do you reckon? Worth a go? Did they make you feel more rested in the mornings? 




 I'd get more distortion at 12 mm. I reckon this is a 16 mm.  




 I think you need to put him on the level of guys like Valentino Rossi and Michel Schumacher - who not only dominated their sports, they transcended them to the point where the whole world started to take notice. 




 Fair go, he led the league in a pretty significant stat category this year, as well as leading the league in dunks. I think there's a discussion to be had.  




 Looks a bit like Michael Jackson.  




 Me too - bear with me here, I might be completely off track, but imagine the ball is your bodyweight. You come down hard on the shoe. The old shoes dissipate that force and don't bounce you back up. The new shoes seem to return most of that downward force back upwards.

How is that a good thing? 




 A ball would bounce much higher on concrete than on a trampoline.  




 ...wouldn't that throw more landing shock back up through the knee? 




 How many people burned their jerseys though? 20 would seem like a high number to me.

Fair enough.   




 Passionate and talented writers, photographers and filmmakers are exactly the people they should be giving prime access to. This is great publicity for everyone. He's demonstrated his ability, both to create strong content and to get it seen. He should get a press pass to whatever he wants now.  




 It's a 7 footer's move, and a really hard one. Big guys get it super easy all the way into the NBA. You'd need a very rare package of size, coordination, skill and dedication to develop that shot.  




 You just drill riders into your stock triples, you don't need to get a whole new jigger!
 




 KTM motorcycles all use WP suspension - stands for White Power but I think they're fairly keen to move on from that. :) 




 Aye, and a flat bar too.

 Nope. But go nuts if you're worried. You'll start out pretty slow - remember you're watching some super skilled riders in these clips. You're a god damned champion if you start hitting those kinds of lean angles.  




 I often go out to an empty carpark at night and run slow circles and figure 8s with a buddy or two. It's fucking hard work but you come away feeling like a god.  




 I dunno, he looked pretty fuckin' buggered when he hit the bench!  




 Scary motherfucker.  




 Wade shits me no end, and this play is part of the reason. Gets the great dunk, then goes out of his way to turn around and step over the guy to try to create a Pippen/Iverson moment. Wanker.  




 Best bike in the whole world ever.  




 A mate stacked my bike years ago, and it had ball-marks in the tank too. I just can't think of what else could cause it...  




 Degrees cost a lot of money. All well and good to get good marks, but some people are in it to learn stuff and challenge themselves!  




 God, he looked stiff as a board to me. It looked like everything hurt.  




 Ugh. Got his money's worth, I guess...

 The one dunk I ever got in a basketball game. I should add, it was a D-grade women's game and I was refereeing at the time. 

I'd spent several hours a day between the ages of 17 and 20 obsessed with trying to dunk. But as a 5'11 white guy the odds were stacked against me. Still, when the stars aligned I could get up there, I just couldn't quite palm the ball to get it down. A volleyball? No worries. A netball? I was throwing those down like Dr. J. Basketballs just eluded me. 

So there I am, bored out of my mind reffing this game, and one of the girls lumbers out on a "fast" break. I'm jogging behind her, the layup goes up, time slows down and my pupils dilate. 

I saw the sit - the ball was going to teeter on the front of the rim. I could just feel it. And instinct kicked in. I wasn't going to miss my chance. 

I took three quick steps and launched, grabbed the ball, and slammed it down with all my strength, shouting like a caveman. I landed triumphantly, threw my head back and hollered. 

And then I saw the confused faces of the players, blew my whistle and gave somebody a sideball. 

Best part was, as we got started again a kid on the sideline burst out in tears, wailing "no Jordans! No Jordans! "

Made my year.  




 I thought it roughly translated to "oh my god I finally got some attention, now I have no idea what to do with it. " 
























 God that was awful. 




 QUIT STOMPING ON THAT KNEE YOU NEED IT GOD DAMNIT 




 Mind you, mileage is more to do with miles per gallon or litres per 100km. And 'fuel efficiency' is about the best synonym we've got for that.  




 Range? 




 This league is just so much better with that crazy bastard in it.  




 Fucking gurgley throated announcer... Ugh. 




 There's more: http://vimeo.com/113812673 




 Sir Jonathan Edward Guthmann.
http://vimeo.com/68336871 




 Nerlens Noel was a big man with injury problems who wasn't going to play his whole rookie season. I think the Cavs thought Bennett might be useful faster - but he buckled like a baby giraffe under the pressure and hasn't looked remotely useful til this year. He's had a few games where he's looked like a bit of a force, he might still prove to be a good pickup for Minnesota. 




 Room noise is part of the buzz for me :( 




 Honda Cb900/919 is the best all-rounder I've ever owned. 




 Did you take that picture in Berlin? I'm pretty sure I got the same one. Flying cocks, gotta love 'em. 




 Either that, or you taped your grandad snoring.  




 I hope they keep ranking him low. I love how much it fires him up. 




 I dunno, I thought the soundtrack was a ripper, but I didn't like the movie at all. Seems about right to me, although I know a lot of people loved it. I guess I'm just not a Coen brothers fan, their style always annoys me. 




 That's a cool trick that toothbrush one.  




 He's working on a bot to do the AMA for him.  




 Well aren't you a ray of sunshine?  




 That's when you do the old wide walk.  




 no na moon ah something sonething doogn doogn 




 Sure, everyone wants to win. It's a matter for the league to address so that genuine competition can be worth watching.  




 Unless you've got money riding on it, it's pure entertainment and nothing more.  




 Ugly basketball.  




 I don't have much to say about the post, but i think i would've experimented with a longer zoom to try to draw out the curve in the path, because that's where my attention goes and it's way off in the distance at the wide angle you've shot with. No use to you but that's what came to mind!  




 Good luck! Mine lasted juuust under 24 hours before one of the motors blew in an altercation with a telephone line. 




 What awesome news! Her "let me try ASMR to you headphones" video was the first one I ever watched, and it still blows my mind. Her accent and speech cadence is just so powerful. Welcome back mate, anyone gives you trouble, you come talk to us. 




 Bombs it like a bad man in 2k.  




 Props to the Spurs there too - full court outlet pass right to the opposite basket and it's STILL a 1-on-2.  




 I love your post work on this. Awesome!  




 It's big in Ireland.  




 I did. Bit of a compulsive game finisher. It got more and more ridiculous until the last mission, which was pure stupidity. Loved it.  




 To be fair, that was a knobbish speech. He doesn't do himself a lot of favors in that regard.  




 /r/cringepics seems to be leaking. 




 That's one sweet cave.  




 I don't know what that is, and I'm gonna keep it that way.  




 It happens to the best of us. 




 Gold! We had a guy suggest "Menial Merriment." He wasn't joking either. 




 That's bizarre... It's just an LED... Will give it a go. 




 I, ah, kinda like facebook. 




 Weird. I've just got a note 4 too. I charge it overnight, and I've had it for nearly a week, and it's totally drained by bedtime every day. Baconreader, Facebook and Chrome, little bit of YouTube here and there and i don't feel like I'm using it all the time. Teach me your secrets.  




 Makes sense in relation to personal attention ASMR.  




 It just gets tiring dealing with a stack of people who all want something from you.  




 She's that good.  




 That white noise one sent me to sleep for about two months.  




 This woman is pure, distilled love and affection. What a sweet soul and a perfect ambassador.  




 That's magnificent.  




 I got a speeding ticket in NZ. The cop apologised profusely and told me if I'd only been 20 over, he'd have let it go... Cost me 60 dollars or something. I wanted to hug the guy. I came home to find a Melbourne hidden camera had caught me for 4 over at 4.30 in the morning, and fined me $180. NZ is the place to be alright! 




 Well that's handy, because it looks like you R1. 




 Went straight to penis. Contents as advertised. 









 That is just a gorgeous jam. 




 I've found their spare parts pricing absolutely terrifying. I ended up making a ZX9 ratbike rather than pay the astronomical price for genuine bits. 




 I just find that a weird way to look at it. Bikes are just stuff, there's good ones and bad ones but it's all about the ride. Getting hung up on one bike or another always seems to lead to bad places when it gets stolen or you stick it in a bush.  




 Angry Barbie! 




 Brutal beauty is best beauty. 




 That slammed bounce pass was a pearler. 




 That's disgraceful. Well done.  




 Yeah but I'd say niggling is less serious than nagging. It's a more playful version of the word.  




 1. Lebron
2. Kevin Durant
3. dick cheeks (my 2k player) 
4. jeremy Lin
5. I'm tired 
6. Metta world peace, what a fuckin stupid name
7. Kanye West, is he a basketballer? 
8. Falls about laughing 
9. There's that knob who runs around trying to intimidate everyone (beats me) 
10. I'm late, screw this  




 Dear person that stole this article wholesale from Gizmag.com, fuck you. At least put a fucking link in.  




 I was pretty amazed.   




 He strikes me as a genuinely stupid man. 




 You're very kind. Here's another I wrote in the same job :

My lebanese wife's shiny locks
Sprout from armpits, back, arms and her box.
Her pubes are so long
And so thick and so strong
That she knits herself into her jocks.

You might think it's strange for a man
To permit so much hair on her can
But it brought us great mirth
At our eldest son's birth;
He came swinging out just like Tarzan.

I'll confess, though, I'm catching the bug;
Even though she's quite ticklish to hug -
And the 'stache on her gash
Sometimes gives me a rash -
It's like rooting a fine persian rug. 




 It seems I've been gilded -  yippee! 

So what does that mean, let me see... 

Well it sounds like a scream 

For the whole reddit team 

But there's bugger all in it for me!

;)  cheers whoever that was! 

 




 No. Not even a little bit.   




 Here's a 4-stanza mini-epic I threw together on a really boring job site once:

-----

My lesbian friend said "I'm horny, 

But fisting's beginning to bore me. 

With five fingers up it, 

I feel like a Muppet. 

I'm sick of my bitch speaking for me."

-----

I replied "the solution is clear. 

It's penis you're needin' my dear. 

They're built for the job, 

Plus they'll fit in your gob 

And I happen to have one right here!" 

-----

"What luck!" said the lass, "I might screw you. 

I've never been that fond of hoo-hoo; 

A big pair of tits, 

They're my favourite bits, 

And most men ain't got 'em - but YOU do! 

-----

I was slightly offended, but fark it - 

It's not every day I can park it. 

Most girls aren't impressed 

With my man-booby chest 

But it's big in the lesbian market.

 That's some Clyde the Glide level floatage. 




 I think this guy should steer clear of the word 'skynet.'  




 Awesome! This doesn't mean you can't go enjoy food, it just means you don't have to if you don't feel like it, you can just fuel up and get on with your day. 




 Or just using them as marks for the actors. 




 Dear jesus god no no no 




 Speed triple is the best bike in the whole world ever.  




 Why would you want to drag race a middleweight triple with a short wheelbase?  




 Nope.  




 5-year-old me would probably think I've got a pretty cool life. I review motorcycles and travel the world singing... But I can't help wondering what 70-year-old me will think of me, because I have saved fuck-all cash for that guy. 




 It felt a little homoerotic, but hey. All for the cause! 




 Didn't have time to defecate on this one. My wildly puckering anus did munch a decent hole out of the seat leather though. 




 Yeah that's me. It was a flinch. I thought I was a goner.  




 Ah... Hey! That's me! AMA. It's midnight here though so I'll answer tomorrow.  




 Yep. 




 You'll be glad to know Nick wasn't put off by the whole experience. He had a ball on the back...

... Because one ball is about all you can fit on that seat... 




 First two bikes I ever loved were Hondas. I'd just be taking a dump on them because they won't give me bikes to review!  




 Cheers mate! I'm easily bored, so I try to make stuff fun. :) 




 Cheers! A bit of a homage to an old Yamaha video I remember from years and years ago.  




 Honda won't answer my emails... Maybe I should borrow a friend's Honda and take a huge dump on it. 









 Military industrial complex, the one that's been propping up the floundering American economy for decades. 




 Absolutely. I'd buy a Blake Griffin autobiography in a second after reading that.  




 I'm not sure my labrador appreciates food at all either - it's gone in seconds and she's off rooting about in the grass for stray faeces for dessert. 




 Szekaly I think?  




 I use a macbook i7 with 12 gb ram, a thunderbolt external monitor and a bunch of thunderbolt drives. I really like fcpx, it took some getting used to but it's very quick for me now, handles DSLR footage like a champion and it's super fast and responsive. Mind you I only really make Web video, it's probably pitched right at my level.  




 Sums up Wade to me, turns around after the dunk to deliberately step over a guy that wasn't in his way. Tosser. 




 That or Slam Dump.  




 For me, it was two things. Firstly every photo I saw on Flickr that I loved seemed to be coming out of the same camera, a full frame. The crops couldn't seem to keep up with the level of detail in sky and cloud areas. I'm not sure if it's dynamic range or what.

Secondly I'd bought the 24-105 lens after trying it on a full frame and didn't realise it wouldn't go as wide on a crop, so I was a bit of a drongo.

At the end if the day I just don't get the same feeling from shots taken on my 7D as I do with those from the 5D2. I'm very happy with the 5d and you can get em pretty cheap right now.  




 The trouble with wheelying for girls is that by the time you finish the wheelie, you're speeding away from them. So there they stand, wanting desperately to lavish you with hero sex, but not knowing where to post it to. 




 No comment on the gas. I'm taking that as a yes.

...aaaaaand as I type that, you're saying "give yourself good quality air to breathe" in my headphones. :P 




 I sang "this used to be my playground" by Madonna in the delivery room as my son was being born. Midwives and wife were united in their discontent.  




 Wow, yeah. But Danny McAskill and the Isle of skye are both cheat codes! I imagine it's much easier to film slower stuff than quick motorcycles as well.  




 That's some shitty drone footage though, I gotta say.  




 Peak horsepower is one thing, but a supercharged litrebike will smash out some serious torque on the way there. The roadgoing H2 will be fucking quick! 




 Get some of this goodness into ya: unintended asmr - Thai massage instruction: http://youtu.be/7SMnFQH6kNE 




 I'm riding a Gen 1 into the ground as my commuter hack as we speak!  




 That model was notorious for it, yeah. Did you try any of the ivan's gear?  




 Fair enough, I guess we wait and see.  




 I have my doubts that this will fully fix it - so many bikes from so many manufacturers come out with that throttle snatch... The MT09 is among the worst, but it seems to be an accepted part of injected bikes these days. I suspect this will improve it but not eradicate it. 




 Wheel spin seems unlikely.
 




 To each his own, but I've never understood the appeal of these giant twin shock retro nakeds. They feel bargey and awkward to me, compared with the sportier naked bikes, it seems harder to get them to handle and you don't gain that much in comfort. GSX14, CB13, the whole segment just confuses me.  




 That would be the perfect Nique moment to cast in bronze. 




 Almost looks like a blackbird tail too.  




 It will help you get chicks all day bro.  




 I dunno what you mean, but feel free to have a crack at it! 




 If they wanna work that hard, they can have us. There's other reasons too - I used to see learners on forums watching other guys' videos and getting fixated on speedo numbers and going out to the same roads to try to match them. Or have people come on and start pissing contests. Better for everyone to have that number disappear.  




 Plenty of great roads in vic. Do a bunch of miles and work on staying wide on entries for maximum vision. Or head to Broadford and go mad on right handers til they feel great!  




 So many reasons. Mainly because we didn't have german porn.  
























 My dad had a car accident at 16 in which he was thrown through the windscreen into a pool of burning petrol. He had no eyelids for a few months and his face ended up looking quite a lot like this guy's, minus the nose thing. 

He was in hospital for 18 months, and had time to come to terms with the fact that nobody was ever going to give him anything based on his looks. 

It turned out to be the making of him in a funny sort of way, he worked his arse off, married a fine gal and became a very successful guy. I've got a ton of respect for the way he carries himself and after the initial 'whoa' most people just forget it's there. He's never even bothered going back to get more plastic surgery to make it look nicer. 

Tough stage of life for it to happen but life goes on.  




 Your friend better not ever try riding in a one-piece rain suit. It either escapes at the neck and steams up your helmet, or it festers and ferments in there til you unzip your suit and drop everyone in the room. 




 You'll send him a sexy granny? 




 Just like I'm the king of the microphone... 




 Their wind noise reduction is almost unbelievable: https://youtu.be/HxVgmovTYjQ 




 Fuck the Cavs.  




 I use a pair of Sena 20s headsets - you can then either record straight to a prism helmet cam or a gopro with a gp10 Bluetooth unit attached - or i think they'll record straight into a smartphone with a Bluetooth recorder app.  




 Discerning players demand that the fuck be shuffled out of their decks? 




 Hey you! Yeah you. Nice chin.  




 Blow us a snot rocket and it'll all be fine. 




 BOATERCYCLE 




 ...duh? 




 That was my first guess too. Came to the comments to confirm, thank you sir!  




 Nice vid, could really do without clickbait titles in this sub though.  




 There are none the like of Bestbrook. 




 I can't get interested in an Aussie league with no Melbourne tigers in it.  




 Kung fu, swing dancing and motorcycling are three hobbies I've found to be very social. I'm sure there's a ton of others depending on what you're into.  




 You have red and blue lights flashing in your helmet? I'd shit myself! Also, set your gear shifts earlier on corner entries, you're unsettling the bike.  




 Great post, thanks!  




 Nice job. I'd stick a fat flat handlebar on it.  




 I'd vote for him. If harden wins, the whistle da real MVP.  




 Chemistry and stacking the team to the rafters.  




 I've got a mate with a tiny knob, he's got a great philosophy on it. I wrote a song about him, you might like the sentiment: https://m.soundcloud.com/wrongtown-brothers/one-little-person 




 Did you deliberately pause that on a shot of Tiago Splitter? Because that thing sure looks like a splitter to me.  




 I'm starting to think that of all his vaunted abilities, team stacking may be the most important.  




 Nobody's asking no questions when it's business time. 




 Haha thanks! First answer that got into my thick skull.  




 You're right - but they're still awesome flicks.  




 Right there with ya. He looks like a fuckin' arsehole.  




 You got a gift there!  




 But then I violently attacked a woman.  




 Anything could've happened to that bunny. Split toning. I call split toning.  




 HOW DID YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT?  




 Am I going crazy? The shot you posted is nothing like any of the misty forest shots in the guy's website. No idea how you plan to get that feeling with such a wildly different shot.  




 Well, I think it was kind of a reference to the one-handed backwards reverse MJ did in 1988, except he threw in an alley-oop pass and went backwards between the legs. This is the one:

https://thebestten.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/michael-jordan.jpg 




 Except he's much shorter, and dunks off one foot where 'Nique was a 2-foot power guy. In fact he looked absolutely nothing like Dominique Wilkins 2.0, except for the fact they're both awesome. 




 Sorry mate, I was ready to get on board until the Wiggins trade, and since J.R. Smith came across I've got nothing but contempt. It's just another grasping pop-up superteam.  




 Australia, whoever is beating the Cavaliers, probably Westbrook.  




 I've had a hubsan x4 and a syma x5. The syma cost 40 bucks and has been amazingly durable. I destroyed the hubsan in 24 hours. The ones without cameras are lighter and easier to fly.  




 My god she almost doesn't look real. 




 They'd need to give Vince an extra scorecard to hold up that says "I coulda done better."
 




 I say we bash 'em. 




 The East is gonna smash the west with dazzling fundamental peach basket. 




 That's a crash, not a close call. And it sure doesn't look like smart riding. Glad you got off with an easy wake-up call and I hope you pull your head in until your ambitions and your talent line up a bit closer, to paraphrase Casey Stoner. 




 In the face of the MVP, no less. 




 ba doooo doooo doooo 




 That cake looks more like your dad than your dad does.  




 So you're saying they have an offense but he's refusing to run it?  




 Chicago needs some kind of offensive system. I've only seen one full game recently - at the warriors - but the bulls hardly seemed to move the ball at all. One pass, maybe one screen, then iso Rose or Pau with zero off ball movement. Pau is great in the post but Rose was chucking up contested off balance jumpers all night - and it didn't look like he had a ton of other options.  




 Instructions unclear.... 









 I would have gone with 'aladocious' instead of 'alidocious.' 




 Well look at it. The right surface of the left rock is lit and vice versa. The light source is in the middle. If you wrap a 180 panorama around, the left side of the frame is looking 90 degrees to your left, and the sun is still back at 0 degrees,  so the angles makes sense.  




 I recommend having a go in a variety of awkward places you can look back and laugh about later. That's what being a kid's all about!  




 What if it's a 180-degree panorama stitch? Then it would make sense that the rocks on the right and left would be lit the way they are. 




 That 360 two-hand windmill thing would have been a stunner if he made it. 




 Some buddies of mine often go to Gasolina in south wharf to watch motogp/sbk. The guys there love their bikes, too.  




 Cheers!  




 I'm in town to do a few bike tests, and I thought I'd pick up a lid while I'm here. Cycle Gear? What's the best place to shop? 




 Let it be so.  




 This is where you offer to wear a homemade cock'n'balls hat and video yourself walking around a shopping mall if you're wrong.  




 You've nailed it... I'm an Aussie in America this week and it feels incredibly insincere and weird to have people constantly attending to me. I don't like it, I'd much prefer to be on equal footing with them. Mind you it's gone the other way in some of the fancy coffee shops in Melbourne, where the wait staff make it clear they feel like they're way cooler than you. 




 Ah for fuck's sake, really? 20% is the standard? Fucking hell.  




 Yeah man, the theatrics on the launch were unbelievable. 




 Clearly you need more stars.  




 Maybe, but a shit planner!  




 C'mon dude, it's all just meat and bones. You'll get over it. 




 Sold! 




 I stuffed up my travel itinerary and bought a ticket to the game, but I'm flying out 2 hours before tip-off. Gutted. Also, I can't resell on ticketmaster because you need a damn American credit card. So... Anyone here want it? 3rd row behind the Pelicans bench. :( 




 Wall formed, league fucked. 




 Well.... it's kinda nice.  




 I hear they have a coke machine now. 




 It might end up cheaper to rent a car after all - how bizarre!  




 Indeed - that's a wonderful tourer, one of the comfiest and most practical things I've ridden. Dunno if I'd really call it an ADV bike though, it's much more of a road bike.  




 Let me know if you hear any more about it. I might ring the Pistons box office when i get there.  




 Daaaamn 40 bucks each way ain't a cheap night out. :( 




 I guess I could rent a car if I had to, but is there an easy way to get out there without one? 




 Aussie here, excited to get tickets to my first NBA game, and maybe a second. I'm staying in the city centre and need to get out to the Palace for the Pelicans and maybe the Nets in the next few days. Google Maps is telling me it's a 3 hour, 4-connection bus ride out there... Whaaaaat? Is there an easy way to get to the game? What would a cab cost? Thanks for your help! 




 Yeah, for sure, it's a bizarre idea. But these are transcontinental tourers and that size makes things smooth and comfy on the road. 




 Yep and yep. I think it doubles as a torque extender for the other tools too.  




 Cheers for the kind words. This is no intermediate level bike, it's a monster. I'm gonna try to get hold of some of those 800cc Triumph triples, maybe a BMW F800 GS or a crossrunner. Til I've tried a few I can't really make a call. But they're all huge compared to a proper dirt bike - the KLR and DR650 are decent dirt focused compromises for road/trail touring.  




 I don't disagree with you - nobody wants to see my ugly mug. Unfortunately I don't always have time to go and make appropriate vision to cover every second of the voiceover, and a talking head makes for an easy edit. I've done plenty of others the way you've suggested but this time the bike was back before I had written the story. Sorry!  




 Cheers mate! 




 They sure are, man. Great once you get going but you better be real careful where you put a foot down. Gave me an appreciation for what our short-arse riding sisters have to deal with.  









 Nick the Dick. And he's flopping it onto a hot dog bun on a serving tray if memory serves. Great movie!  




 No amount of patents can convince me that hydrogen will take over as the next big thing. It's a pain in the arse to deal with, and a hugely inefficient use of energy.  




 It looks like they actually took it off his Facebook page. Luck it down folks!  




 LeBron could be awesome. He just doesn't wanna.  




 I've been riding more than 12 years. Take me off a bike and I'm still that kid.  




 You can say poo, you're on the Internet.  




 The 1980s Celtics plus Len Bias.  




 Dunk of the year? It's great, but he does something like this every other game!  




 If it makes you feel better, he's been phoning it in all season anyway.  




 White Australian here. Appropriation is one thing you could call it - another is that she acts like a complete fool. But hey, pop music wouldn't be doing its job if old people like me didn't think it was garbage.  




 You should have sex with him. If he likes it, he's a total pervert.  




 Did... Did I just hear you bitching about bitching about bitching? HOW DEEP CAN WE GO?  




 LOVE FIST! LOVE FIST!  




 I would love to see a video of this.  




 Let's just hope he doesn't take the *other* Paul George leap.  




 And now we can get back to not wanting to watch it.  




 Don't bother with the camera, they're absolute shite until you get very expensive and add a stabilising gimbal. They also weigh the quad down and chew battery. The same Sena without the camera is even better.  




 Except your skill at conjugation.  




 Personally, I lost my shit when I saw it melt away. I even called the missus over to gawk. 




 A buddy of mine used to work picking up corpses for the coroner. She said these kinds of deaths were way more common than you'd think.  




 Way i read it, he was giving his team a serve for how badly they got torched in the first half.  




 *predominant 




 It's rubbish. 




 They laid the groundwork, but the NBA rose and fell internationally with Jordan.  




 Jordan more or less *created* the golden age of basketball.  




 AKA 'the vaginalympics.' 




 Bands live and die on their lead singer - I've been in quite a few. And the most interesting people artistically are often complete twats. LSD, in the Van Halen sense, is very real.  




 That floater is Rose's skyhook. Unguardable, instant release, over 7 footers no worries. 




 Shows how much I know, I don't even think I'd star that one in Lightroom... 




 But he's sprinting that fast on snow and ice... 
























 The outtakes were not pretty.  




 That's the first one we did in that sort of style but you might like what we did with the MT-09:  https://youtu.be/f1i9Ww27lxU 




 I'm just shit at kick starting. A mate who grew up on dirt bikes got it going in 7 or 8 tries.  




 Absolutely. It's easy to ride and pleasant to get about on. You're not getting Yamaha reliability - but on the other hand if you don't mind getting the spanners out now and then to do minor tighten ups and check things over, it'll teach you more about maintaining your own machine than you'll learn on a Yamaha.  




 I can tell you on our test bike the exhaust shield bolts came undone on day 2. But pop a bit of loctite on and you should be right. It's the classic bike experience.  




 GET OUT 




 Yeah he was a surprise - I just wanted somebody to walk down the street playing trombone, I had no idea he could impersonate a motorcycle! Right guy to call! 




 Damn, great find! Thanks for that. That's a pretty compelling graph. 




 Haha sorry mate, we got a bit twisted with this.  




 I left a shot out where I tasted the himalayan pink salt and said 'mmmm, that's good salt.' 




 We were trying to keep things a touch ambiguous. Personally I can hardly watch it. I'm loving the YouTube comments. Haha!  




 It depends what you ride for. For me it's the thrill, and a naked makes fast feel a lot faster. I like having to hold on when the pace comes up, it's much more involving than sitting behind a fairing. More reward for less risk.  




 You don't spend much time on Web forums, do ya?  




 Looks a lot like the Zero S from some angles. 




 Look to the superteam of the East. There's your villain. 




 Last year was magnificent. Total humiliation.  




 I hate the cavs with my whole shriveled, black little heart.  




 This might be the year they finally grow up and do what everyone believes they can if they play the ball and forget the refs. 




 I used it just this week. It's there! Make sure you haven't clicked on a category that's restricting your search. Click on Video in effects and search for letterbox.  




 I dunno mate, check my history, I'm not a bullshitter.  




 The one dunk I ever got in a game. It was a D-grade women's game and I was reffing. All alone on a fast break, this lady puts up a layup, and I can see the instant it leaves her hand exactly what's about to happen. It's going to sit pretty right in front of the rim.

I was obsessed with dunking. At 5"11 and white, this was not a healthy obsession. I used to jump off things to make it happen. I could jump straight up and hang on the rim with both hands, but was an inch or two short of being able to throw it down. It just burned me inside, I used to dream about dunking at night.

So when I saw that ball, something snapped inside me. I was already at full sprint, but I changed course to head for the basket instead of the baseline... One, two, launch... I caught the ball with one hand and jammed the fuck out of it, and roared like a mountain lion.

Then I had to blow the whistle and give somebody a sideball as they all looked at me in total shock. And to make things worse, one of their kids on the sideline started crying and saying "NO JORDANS, NO JORDANS."

Doesn't matter; got dunk. I never got another dunk in a game but I can now die happy. 




 We'll see it in MCN as "LEAKED: could this be the new GSX-R?" 




 I've been helping out with promo in Australia, so i got to our local premiere. Great film, very funny. I never saw the first one but laughed my arse off at this one.  




 Fucken yay. 




 Jesus that guy's voice is just exquisite. It's the perfect instrument for pop.  




 Aaaaaaaaand no NBA for you Australia.  




 It's a bastard to get out of that stadium. 




 Unfortunately then you will have zucchini.  




 That guy is just ridiculous.  




 Another tip: I forgot to pay my rego and was pulled over for unregistered driving. Had to pay the rego by the side of the road before I could leave, but I got a 750 buck fine on top of it. 

Because it was within 2 weeks of the rego expiry, I was able to write in, say it was a mistake and get let off on a warning.  




 Not the worst way to spend a lunch hour. Definitely read the instructions, no matter how good you think you are - step 1 is "take the lid off the jar before you do anything else." 




 You sure you're infertile? I thought I was supposed to be after losing a nut and having chemo, but now I've got a son who disagrees with that assessment.  




 Took me about 5 years to be able to think clearly and sharply again, it felt like I was thinking through cotton wool. I found modafinil helpful.  




 I carry the gear I need for the job... If there's no job, the camera in my phone is good enough for snapshots. 




 Aw.  




 I like the way it rises like an empress above the Seeeerengetiiiiiii.  




 You and George Clooney.  




 Did he boop him on the wang there?  




 That's a great way to make sure next game the chants go "refs you suck dicks." 




 And the layups, and the open long twos. He's gonna be shattered.  




 That tech near the end - does he get that call if he hasn't been a whiny bitch all year? Huge call.  




 Dirigible.  




 I wonder what the stats are on gay dudes drawing dicks. Higher or lower rate of knobdoodling than straight guys?  




 STARTED FROM THE BOTTOM NOW WE... STILL HERE.  




 Or, YouTube could simply play vertical videos back in vertical orientation. 




 Actually it pretty much does. And ninja turtles.  




 I was against the idea of ABS until I tried it in the rain. It's beaut. And there are genuinely bikes out there now that are so fast that I find myself leaning on the ABS on fast roads. That's probably not a good thing, but the technology is astounding. Not to mention Bosch's cornering ABS system which takes it to the next level. 




 He's also shown he can be a huge douche, don't give your heart away so easily. 




 I suspect it'll be terrible. I know a company that's working on it - soundracer.com - and those guys have a fun thing that plugs into your car cigarette lighter. It reads the revs on your engine and then transmits the sound of a huge V8 to your car stereo so it feels like you're driving a monster truck. 

But it relies on revs - to do this for an electric vehicle, you'd need to simulate the presence of gear changes. It would ruin the effect. 




 I've ridden plenty of loud bikes, but I split every day on a bike that's as quiet as a mouse. I regularly sit and wait behind guys who plod along blipping their throttle waiting for assistance from car drivers to get through. The best thing you can do to make your bike better for splitting is to fit fold-in mirrors. 




 I like the sound of a bangwagon. Amish porn?  




 Yep. I'd put a giant-arsed family size pizza tray sprocket on the back and make it even more berserk if I owned it. I've got no business going more than 300kmh.  




 I've seen what they're working on for the next model and it will be right up your alley.  




 This is 100% down to battery cost. And there's some serious volume manufacturing staying to happen soon that is expected to bring the prove of batteries down by 75% - that's the target, at least.  




 I didn't get the prism til later. It's a GP10 Bluetooth backpack on the GoPro 3+ that receives the sound and sticks it on the GoPro vision.  




 Yeah I was traveling so I bought a lid in California, and I wanted something ADV style. But it wasn't too bad, even at speed!  




 The Gigafactory is all about cost reduction. But every battery company on the planet reckons they've got something with twice the energy density on the bench due to better structures or chemistry. Obama threw 6 billion dollars at the industry a few years back and there's just a constant stream of new ideas coming through. I have a lot of faith that major breakthroughs will change the game in the next 5-10 years. I'd love to see a graph of battery improvement since the 1990s, ni-cad through to Li-po and beyond, I suspect you'd be surprised.  




 Because people are still stressing about range on these things and going from direct drive to putting a gearbox in is at least a 10% drop in mechanical efficiency.  




 I have a strong recollection of one of the FAST BIKES guys pictured in a magazine pulling a huge stoppie on a GSXR K5, I think it was, without his fingers on the brake lever. This shot reminded me of that photo, and now I can't find the god damn picture. 




 Aprilia runs hot as a motherfucker. You'll need tin foil underpants if you "cruise" on it so you can get a nice crispy skin on your baked spuds. Good bike for going flat out on, but grumpy around town. My pick is the S1000RR, the 2015 model optioned up with the active suspension and cruise control. That's one hell of a bike. Super easy to putt about on, plus goes like stink on a full throttle, and having ridden a good few superbikes I'd say it's also been the comfiest for me. 




 Yep, brought a 20S with me to America and bought a helmet when I got there. Had the little GP10 GoPro backpack on. Sadly I fucked up the angle of the chest camera and I had precious little time to film, so that stuff was all but unuseable. The 20S does a pretty remarkable job considering I got up to about 130-140mph on some of those little squirts. 




 Here's the thing - massive, monstrous levels of performance are just not an issue. Range, battery density, fast charging standards and battery price are - and those will come down fast as the Gigafactory and other mass battery manufacturing operations kick into gear. All the things like emissions and noise regulations, and all the complicated reasons why petrol engines need more and more complex engineering to keep improving them - electrics don't have to worry about any of that stuff.  




 He's right - full throttle at a standstill doesn't take off like a rocket. It's an immensely powerful and torquey motor locked in a very high gear. I suspect most gas superbikes would beat it to 40mph. But hit the gas at 60mph, like I was on the Skyline road, and there's *nothing* I've ridden that comes close. It's absolutely insane. And if I owned one I'd downgear it as far as is practical, because I ain't gonna be doing 218mph any time soon and I'd want that monster performance as accessible as possible. 




 US$38k... Yeah. Still early adopter territory. 




 I don't think I'd have worked it out if he didn't put the tail piece next to it. 




 I had a Boss Hoss in my session on a track day once. Sat back and watched him lug that lardy barge around for a lap. It was a huge chore in the corners but he was clearly having a giggle smoking it up on the exits and the straights.

 Yeah, but you know how that stuff works. People who post that sort of shit are usually the ones who most need that message, that's why it resonates enough for them to want to post it. John Lennon's a great example - his lyrics were 'peace, love, mung beans' but he physically and mentally abused his wife. 




 I'm a father. I toss my son in the air heaps coz he loves it. Ok he's indifferent but I love it. Screw you guys.  




 No, but c'mon in buddy. Your bike is now an orphan again.  




 Fucking pricks. Just about every story or photo I post gets stolen and rehosted somewhere too. Even worse to see it submitted on reddit.  




 Melbourne is one of the best places in Australia to ride a motorcycle. Nice wide lanes you can split down, and you can park your bike on most footpaths for awesome access to just about anything. So if you're at all interested in bikes, this is a beaut place to ride them. Sure as fuck shits on public transport.  




 It's training. Easier if you do it earlier, but I believe if there's nothing physiologically wrong with you, you can learn.  




 *timbre 




 That's how basic traction control works when it has different levels you can select. Slide control is a bit more complex as I understand it. 

The latest and greatest bikes are starting to run inertial control units that can get very accurate readings of things like your lean angle, the pitch of the bike, g-loads and yaw. I believe slide control uses the lean angle and yaw readings to allow the bike to get a certain amount of sideways happening before it gently intervenes. 

I've only had one quick track session on it, and I was focusing on the active suspension out there, so I didn't play with that setting. But the electronics are just getting more and more amazing.  




 The new S1000RR has slide control.  




 He sure does seem to ride like a man who hasn't figured out how hard the ground can be yet. Magic.  




 He's got that humble dunk attitude though. I wanna see him break out a bit of flash.  




 I was looking for Gerald Green.  




 DONGGGG 




 Mind you the really cutting edge stuff from silicon valley rarely seems to work on android first.  




 For the continuity stuff, you can get pushbullet for android. Works great.  




 ...and those fucken mushrooms. Dear god they are just ridiculously good.  




 Dunno what side of town you're on but there's a taiwanese restaurant opposite Malvern station that sells it as 'XXL chicken' as well.  




 SOUND BATHS! SIGN ME UP!  




 Best in-game dunker in the league. OH YEAH I SAID IT 




 We'll know in a day or two!  




 I'd say don't bother with a camera until you can afford one that is stabilized. The vision is useless, and the cameras weigh the quads down, reducing maneuverability and flight time.  




 Melbourne, Australia. It's about to become legal here in a limited sense but has been tolerated add long as I remember. I split every chance I get and will change lanes if I can't get through. I'll fold in my mirrors if things get tight. I make sure I don't hold car drivers up, and they don't hold me up, that's my rule.  




 Paywalled.  




 Big announcement from DJI tomorrow... 




 Brave is one word for it.  




 You're probably right. But you never know.  




 How you feeling about this at this point?  




 Extraordinary work, mate. Get yourself a license and go commercial with it.  




 Yes, because the usual crowd of bron chasers would flock to follow him. For all his many vaunted skills, team stacking may be his most powerful ability.  




 Correction: as I understand it, the terms of the TPP are to be kept secret for FOUR YEARS AFTER IT IS SIGNED.  




 Can you do us a favor and post a dyno chart?  




 Just tell 'em where the stops are and maybe any hits you want them to catch. Work with them in rehearsal or send them a recording of a groove if you like.  




 In all seriousness, this is why I recommend if you're gonna go and ride hard, you should learn how to wheelie and stoppie. When a wheel comes up you should know how to handle it, and the best way to practice that is in a safe place at lower speeds.  




 I generally get along well with Canadians - same as kiwis and scots. I think all us little brother countries have a similar attitude.  




 I don't see a lot of hate for AD, Curry or Durant. The guys that cop it do for a reason.  




 Get a bit of mongrel up ya Wiggins! Don't gimme that fluffy weak crap! 









 He broke back in again though. 




 Who's cuddling up and enjoying movies? I look at that guy and experience about double the 'holy shit' factor I get from Arnie - it's an awe inspiring display of insanely hard work and discipline combined with jackpot genetics and the best nad shrinking drugs money can buy. Arnie's physique is stunning but believable. This guy is so far beyond that, it looks almost like another species.  




 I believe that's how it works. So players can be totally confident they won't be tested again after their 4th check. Seems ridiculous to me but I think it's part of the deal with the players' union. 




 The NBA needs to publish the dates of when each player gets his 4th and final 'random' drug test for the year. 




 Bummer eh. I suppose it must be a touch demoralising being a stand-in and knowing you'll be sitting behind one of the greatest in the game as soon as he's healthy again. 




 What the heck happened to PJ3? He looked like durant-lite for stretches when KD was out. Did I miss a memo somewhere? 




 Yep I thought I was a goner. Passenger had no idea til she saw the video... That was the last time she got on a bike. 




 Maaaaate who needs brakes? They just make you go slow.  




 I was there too. Stonking motorbike. That suspension... Wow.  




 This is me on the bike. Looking back at it still scares the shit outta me. https://youtu.be/9TxEw1LunfM 





























 Just wait for him to get a bit older.  




 It could happen yet... 




 She gots her nails did. 




 Happy with the switch, very hard to look back. 




 ...or any number of other reasons. My son had torticollis, couldn't turn his head to the right. 




 Yeah we stuck an Evel Knievel sticker kit on our kid's lid, with his name on the back. Made him a bit of a star with the neighbourhood ladies. 




 Inflated? 




 That road was in the east.  




 HEE-HEE! 




 Forget about it, the Cavs just barely squeaked past a Hawks team minus Horford, Korver and Sefolosha. They had a hard fight against a Bulls team with a hobbled Noah, an absent/injured Pau Gasol and a terrible offense that seemed to rely on Derrick Rose prayers. Lebron is wearing down and cramping while playing massive minutes. I'm expecting a bloodbath in the finals. 




 He's 0-10 right now... 




 Gerald Green's gotta be up there. 




 Dunno why you're getting downvoted, that looks like the answer.  




 Of COURSE he is. Fucken.  




 Expose for the skin in the shadows, this blows the highlights out like that.  




 Yay Eastern conference. 




 Man those Hawks uniforms... *snif*

/Nique fan in the 80s. 




 Wasn't Penny a point guard? 




 Mate they've been playing on the BBC in the UK. It's everywhere.  




 But when they are... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alYUJbweWjc 




 Sorry to disappoint, I'm a writer and video producer and my editor spends all week trying to stop me being filthy at every opportunity. Sometimes he's successful... Either way this fart has been played all round the office, I hear it popping up on various computers a few times a day... People are getting sick of it but one of the finance guys reckons I'm a god. :) 




 Judges are good for giving technical feedback and educated performance notes, but they tend to reward accuracy over entertainment. You can't have competitions that are entirely audience judged either, or it becomes who brings the loudest friends. But if you focus on the audience you'll be a better act.  




 At the end of the day, the audience is all that matters.  




 "Sharon" is reluctantly proud, a state she spends a fair bit of time in. 




 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=218iXiKhKlg 




 My pleasure! :) 




 Hahaha! :) 




 I was just the channel through which this entered the world.  




 That's just how good a fart it was. 




 I'm 38. Every fart is a free laugh waiting to be enjoyed. 




 She's so serious! That's pure gold. Tell them thanks, from the heart of my bottom. 




 Awesome mate, that warms the ol' cockles! 




 Synchronicity... We found out yesterday my wife's uncle only has a few days to live. I guess I made this thing as a bit of a reaction to some awful news. Look after your gal!  




 Ripped a couple this morning but nothing up to the Beethoven standard as yet.  




 You got me, I'm terrible with theory. :) 




 I was on a soft camping bed, my technique is usually solid. But I appreciate the tips! 




 Just checking my message history, his response was "I would wager that's the best thing you've discovered in 2015?" 




 No sir, if I could do this on purpose I'd be a rich and famous man. 




 I believe /r/farts is ready and waiting for your contributions! 




 PM me your email address, I've found only one other fart I didn't delete but I'll happily send it over. 




 I miss my brother, he's moved out of town. So I've been recording my farts and sending them to him so he doesn't get too homesick. 




 That makes me feel good, because my own mum is not so happy. 




 I'm not here to take your glory, but to inspire you. You'll make that name famous some day. 




 There are many people on here far more talented than me - if this fart got remixed, it'd be sensational! 




 Lay it on us. 




 If you're gonna steal from anyone, steal from the greats. Seems my arse has excellent taste, who knew? 




 I have a brother. He needed to hear them. 




 The guys in Eternityclub are all looking at me funny.  




 I can't remember, I'll have to ask the lads that were in the room at the time. 




 I sure hope so! 




 On me phone. Yep, farted on me phone. I am not a smart man. 




  /r/EternityClub: front page posters only

You may be right... I didn't spend that much time on this, because, well, you don't expect it to be the fart that brought the world together on one day in May. 




 Ten points if you whistle the fart symphony during honeymoon sex.  




 Right, I'm going to bed. The last few hours have been truly exhilarating. Thousands upon thousands of people have listened to my greatest fart, and my arse now has an agent. I'm just not sure how tomorrow is going to get any better. But you never know. 




 I was recording all my farts at the time, to send to my brother. 




 Hahahahahahahaha

edit: god it just keeps going, I love it! 




 I totally sing that one in the band... Maybe that's where my date got it from! 




 Tomorrow is a new day, and now you have a perfect recording device in your pocket at all times. You got this! 




 I'm not ready for instant rectal fame and fortune, my butt would be flogged out after a 90-minute show. 




 I was recording all my farts to send to my brother. He's moved out of town. 




 Send us an audition tape. 




 Here's to you! 




 My pucker has brought a lot of happiness to the world this day. I'm going to buy it a lollipop. 




 Nope, that's all yours! 




 Stralia mate! 




 Five year olds, they know what's up. 




  http://www.kooplet.com/cgi-bin/kooplet/search.pl?w= q=46404a404d40514052404f404d40 p=S:1;D:NaN;P:0;H:1;R:0;L:0; t=p

What a resource! 




  second musical idea in Movt 3 of Beethoven's 6th.

I just don't think I'll ever be able to fart that fast. 




 I'm a dad. It could happen to you. 




 I thought about it, but I couldn't be stuffed opening Logic and I dunno how to autotune in Garageband. Now I'm kind of regretting that I didn't hire a proper orchestra. 




 Tell him the fart guy says "high five..."

And then when he puts his hand up, grab it and tickle the little dude like mad. :D 




 /u/hacksilver found it! https://youtu.be/iQGm0H9l9I4?t=1429 




 They would all sound incredibly pedestrian next to this one. 




 18th in Australia buddy! G'day from down under. 




 There's always that risk. 




 See this kind of thing makes it all worthwhile. You have a great day mate! 




 I've seen one live, twice - Mr. Methane. He brought the house down, awesome stuff. 




 I just use the Android sound recorder and share 'em via Message. A warning though, if you start doing this, you will be farting on your phone a lot. And then you might be putting it close to your face. Just sayin'. 




 I don't see why not. 




 Lately, yeah. I send them to my brother.

He doesn't send anything back. 




 I mean, I'd like to... 




 Tell me about it, I just signed a licensing agreement for my bunghole. I'm not even joking. 




 I sure hope you're right. 




 I'm gonna go ahead and take a guess that this is more of a boy thing. 




 hahahaha excallent! 




 MY GOD MAN I THINK YOU FOUND IT! 




 Any chance you can dig up a link on that? 




 Listen to it, man. I mean really listen. It's a beauty. Farts like that come along what, once a month? 




 My brother moved out of town, I started texting him my farts so he wouldn't feel so homesick. 




 Just ask away, man. What do you need to know? 




 HAVE A RIPPER DAY MATE! :) 




 My brother moved out of town, I started texting him my farts so he wouldn't feel too homesick. 




 I'm not sure I can really take the credit here. My bunghole did most of the work. But it does seem to be making a lot of people happy, which is not something many bungholes get to do. 




 If you see it, tape it for me. That would make my year. 




 We can only hope. 




 My brother moved an hour away, and I was missing him. I started texting him my farts so he wouldn't get homesick... But when this one came out, I knew it was special.
 




 Right there with you, man - I'm gonna go to bed soon knowing that by the time I wake up, hundreds of thousands of people all over the world will have listened to my pucker. My eyes are red, from crying so much, from laughing so much. My stomach is actually sore. The world is a wonderful place. 




 No. I plan to keep on farting until another movement comes out. 




 My brother moved away from town, and I was missing him. So I started texting him farts to let him know I love him. This would have been in the first dozen or so, but the second it came out I knew it was special. 




 Hahahahahahaha I'm in tears here! 




 You turn your back for ONE MINUTE..... 




 On a serious note, my missus is certain she's heard that melody somewhere before in a classical piece. Perhaps Vivaldi? If there's any classical music aficionados out there, I'd love to know if my butt is a plagiarist. 




 How many beautiful tunes have been carried off on the wind, never to be heard again? 




 You never know, your butthole might be the next Wagner. I never knew the talent I was sitting on. 




 I have no idea, but it kinda works...? 
Hahahaha! 




 Then my Sunday was well spent. :) 









 Theo Ratliff was the first to give him a high 5 on that game winner... Haha! 




 This - hitting shots is a 50/50 thing if you get a decent look. Getting a steal off a storied rival all-star, on the most crucial play of a Finals game, then creating a shot to end the perfect career... Gotta be MJ. 




 Amazing that he can lose traction on the painted lines so many times, and then just keep throwing it in there onto them. 




 I spent a couple months with an early production jigger from another company in my lid, it put me off HUDs altogether. Turns out it's a lot of extra shit to have in your helmet for what seemed to me to be very little benefit. 




 Ctrl-F Ephemeral Rift.... Yyyyyyup. 




 Ah you might have to pay for his stuff now, he used to keep a blog showing lighting setups and whatnot that I found very educational.  




 This guy used to post here heaps: http://www.koloskov.com/

His product stuff is great and he has a bunch of tutorials on his site.
