 I find this usually happens when your zoomed in too much. zoom out a bit and then it should work cause it works for me.  




 I'm really looking forward to American Sniper are there any movies out right now that are similar to it that I should watch? 




 holy crap do people these days actually know how to spell? "you actually take the works right out of my mouth" do you even english? 









 THE NORTH REMEMBERS!  




 they need to demand that sony sell spiderman back to marvel.  









 Sony should release it claiming they have changed the ending when actual fact they havent. how would north korea know? unless they had a spy actually go watch the released cut.  




 Dont keep trying if it keeps declining it could still be charging you for each time you try. Id wait a bit, most likely the servers are getting borked.  




 Nice set up, like how you have the tv on the wall.  









 If we dont have a hulk movie by phase 4 im gonna be pissed.  














 It will easily play it, dont know about ultra tho. I run it on a gtx 660 with medium to high settings at 1080p.  









 Its one of the best pc ports ever. so yes you should buy it. Plus its not a bad game. even though its like an hour long if your going to play the phantom pain next year youll need to play this.  




 Nope works for me. I have an I7 4790, GTX 660, 8GB ram.  














 I got MGSV: GZ and Flight Simulator X.  









 Bilbo saw a dragon, frodo saw eagles. bilbo wins.  









 yea not funny at all.  









 enjoy your downvotes.  









 i reckon someone already has a copy of it and is sitting on it waiting for the right moment to leak it.  




 Didnt angels and demons cause a bit of controversy?  









 Hopefully someone leaks it.  




 well fuck sony, I hope the hackers screw them up so bad that they have no other choice to sell spiderman back to marvel.  









 its a good work laptop but its no gaming machine.  




 Ive enjoyed every minute of this show but im down to the last 3 episodes of season 2 and i really dont want it to end thats how much ive enjoyed it. Im debating whether or not to finish it now or wait for season 3 so i wont have to wait as long.  




 Nice, This is mine here in New Zealand. Its about 23 outside right now. http://iforce.co.nz/i/yv1r4bep.svc.jpg 




 because there never was a trailer. it was all rumor. it was never actually officially confirmed.  









 why? msi is awesome.  




 I personally will always go with the i7 model as the extra threads for work will come in handy. If you're just playing games then an i5 will be alright but youll find a few years down the line the i5 will begin to bottle neck when compared to the highest i7 at the time because of the extra threads. In some cases there is usually only a $50 difference between an i5 and i7 which is another reason i go for an i7. 
 




 did anyone else read that in the style of the CS voice over lol.  




 most likely testing it.  




 Apparently they are sold out http://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/2plz1b/newegg_is_sold_out_of_its_free_3_games_from_the/ 




 usually there is a countdown timer on the steam page of a game thats releasing in a day or so but there is nothing on he ground zeroes page. It just says coming soon. Doesn't that seem a bit strange? or is it just that Konami doesn't know how to use steam? 




 yea? this was announced ages ago.  




 are you overclocking? try resetting to stock clocks and see what happens.  




 haha lol that sure surprised me.  




 its already the 18th here in New Zealand and im wondering why it hasn't started yet :( 




 sell the pc for what ever he can get and save up for new rig? 




 we already have DRM with movies from Itunes you cant play the file outside of Itunes hence its locked to one player. Thats DRM enough imo.  




 yes we have a special coming next year followed by S4 in 2016 but with Cumberbatch now signed on to play Doctor Strange i fear that we are only going to get less and less Sherlock despite Cumerbatch saying he wants to play him to an old man i fear his schedule just wont allow it which begs the question how much longer can the series keep going?  




 I agree and disagree. The way light sabers were used in the prequels was definitely one of the few positives in my books. That final duel between Obiwan and Anakin was incredible, it was just so beautifully choreographed it was like watching a well performed ballet. But i also agree that the duel between vader and luke in empire strikes back was amazing to. It all comes down to whether or not you prefer the prequels or original trilogy and clearly your a fan of the original trilogy and i can respect that. I seem to be one of the few fans who like both trilogies.  




 I'm assuming that's why it says potential. Doesn't necessarily mean it will happen.  









 love the way that 980 lights up. so awesome.  









 Bad AutoModerator!  




 obviously fake since GFWL is no more.  




 yes those specs are real, and yes the ps4 and xbox one are basically low end pcs that use proprietary hardware and cant be upgraded. Basically they are pcs without all the bells and whistles.  




 you ether have a shitty isp or you have some serious line issues ether in your house or between you and the exchange. get that shit sorted bro.  




 man thats to close to the edge.  




 he said $300 lol not $1000.  




 Just show them to this. http://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/wiki/guide 




 Needs a bit more cable management when you get the time. But other than that looks good.  




 no way your building a pc with that you need at least $450 but even thats pushing it.  




 who has a limit? lol.  









 I find your lack of taste in movies disturbing.  




 its a small game bro, its like 2 and half hours long that sounds about right.  




 1080p easily. 1440p will be pretty decent but you may need to lower some settings. 4k will struggle.  




 you should be able to point steam to the directory of the second hard drive.  




 Because i already have everything i want. who knows this feeling? :( 




 i have $109 to be exact lol  




 na it sucks.  




 i got the images from here http://www.pcgamer.com/windows-10-leaked-build-reveals-new-xbox-app/

what do you guys think of this new xbox app for windows 10? is it a steam like app or just more DRM? i noticed on the bottom left there is a store icon. How cool would it be if we could purchase and play xbox games on pc? it would be a step in the right direction on microsofts part to make a unified experience which is what they hinted at a while ago with that windows 10 announcement that showed a pc, xbox one, tablet etc all lined up against each other. What do you guys think. 




 say you need to test it to make sure its not DOA. 




 Its a good game, dont listen to this review.  




 dude thats not good. Do other temperature reading programs have this issue cause if they do you probably need to reseat your cpu. just sayin.   




 yea that bit was leaked in the emails. its happening in january.  









 At least they're patching it. gotta give some credit. They could of chosen to just leave it the way it was but they did not.  




 The Crew,Fire Works Simulator, Final Fantasy XIII-2. 




 its actually one of the better COD games.  




 clearly a problem with your gpu. The game runs perfectly fine for me.  









 ether the cooler is not mounted properly or you need new thermal paste.  




 BUT 2 GPU  MUST BE BETTER THAN 1 AM I RITE? :( 




 LOL! INB4 CONSPIRACY.  









 What are your thoughts on the pc version so far? i picked it up and im actually enjoying it more than XIII.  




 Looks correct to me? what cpu do you have? nvm I see your flair, it says you have a i5 3570 which is the correct cpu its showing.  




 I would of said Aaron Taylor Johnson but hes already quick silver. Most of the good guys are taken already. they would probably have to cast an unknown but someone who could stand toe to toe on screen with the avengers cast.  
























 his facial expressions tho lol 




 dude nice!  




 And Im actually enjoying this more than FFXIII, makes you realize how badly written the lightning character actually was and the story is just so much better (especially without lightning) in XIII-2 imo.  




 Inb4 Bring Back Brody.  




 Even if its just for a cameo like he bumps into Quinn out on the streets of Pakistan and gives him a piece of advice or something about going rogue. Or he confronts Carrie about a CIA conspiracy or something. But they need to get him involved it would be awesome.  




 what temps are you getting? sounds like it might have gotten a bit dusty or your power supply isn't coping with the stress.  




 January 27th.  




 there was? got a link.  




 What movies do you consider to be a hidden gem? 









 haha this is awesome.  




 basically what the title says. do you think well see more high frame rate movies after the hobbit or does the format die with the release of the last hobbit movie? 




 Yea I skimmed through it and stopped when i saw pics of the actual script.  




 Ouch. Hope it turns out as good as Skyfall or at least Casino Royale.  




 Just scan your computer, thats all you can really do atm. Perhaps change your passwords to all your important accounts just in case.  




 Correct. ALI213 is the default name a particular pirated version of the game uses.  




 I almost choked on my own saliva reading this haha.  




 where have you been? hes talking about all the leaked emails from sony.  




 Im enjoying it. Havent really had an issue with the micro transactions since i dont use them.  




 Dude he's been awesome as spidey and it will kill him if this happens. Hes a true fan. They have to keep him.  









 thats a good thing! people need to realize that adaptations that steer away from their source material is a good thing since not everything translates well into film.  




 Box and Hardware Pr0n. Nice!  




 lol dat pirated copy of AC:Unity.  




 This has never happened to me! off all things that have happened to me no one has ever tried  to scam me on steam. where are these so called scammers? never encountered one at all.  




 I dont even want to watch it because i know it will just piss me off.  









 Whats the best flight simulator out right now? 




 uncharted games usually do end up looking just like the footage in the trailers.  









 And Oliver stayed dead. Would you guys still watch if Roy took over team arrow? 




 I just bought the crew and i cant even activate my key cause apparently the servers are down or their are connection issues. Is this happening for anyone else? 









 Seems to be a common trend these days. the first couple of months of the new year are usually the dumping ground for movies you would think would be better suited for directed to dvd releases. March has gotten better over the last couple of years with movies like the hunger games taking advantage of the less competition during that time but Jan-Feb continue to deliver nothing but crap. Any particular reason for this? 














 Just got back from seeing the battle of five armies. I need some time to digest what i saw but over all it was really good imo a fitting conclusion to the middle earth saga. 




 After what happened on yesterdays episode. This now opens the door to a civil war in the MCU with the rise of more Inhumans it gives a reason for stark to get nervous about people with special abilities and to start talking to the government about how to deal with these people. 









 Can anyone tell me what movies are still canon in the x-men timeline? 




 For instance mine are the james bond films i always tell my self ill re watch skyfall or quantum of solace this weekend but nope it never happens. Anyone else got a movie their like that with.  




 I feel like it doesnt really represent the tone of the film all to well i think they should of just cut it and started straight at the marvel logo followed by quills dancing scene as usual. would of been much better imo  



















 But this time have him direct it instead of Blomkamp. Surely Microsoft knows they have a good thing going here with Halo and that people actually want to see this made! the short films Blomkamp did for the halo 3 advertising campaign were amazing so if they could still get Blomkamp involved as producer along side Jackson it would be perfect. If you dont know what im talking about check this out. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejw3xpPIVbQ 




 I quite often see people complaining about this one. Anyone care to explain? 














 Cause they are too serious for Collin Firth's taste hehe.  




 So in just a few days the last hobbit movie finally releases which means Peter Jackson's middle Earth saga will be complete. The hobbit trilogy has had mixed reception compared to LOTR but thinking a head how will the trilogy go down in history? do you think more people might start to appreciate over time? or will people continue despise it? 




 Gonna buy the game tonight. Any one know where the cheapest place is to buy it? 









 Cause your cpu and gpu are running hotter than normal. God damn it. Time to invest in better cooling.  









 Havent played the game since release on pc so decided to try patch 1.3 and I must say even though there are still some bugs that need to be worked out like still being able to glitch in walls and swimming in mid air lol in terms of frame rate and just in general the ability to just play the game without stuttering its a huge improvement. Just thought id add my two cents. 

Specs of my rig. 

I7 4790
8GB RAM
GTX 660 2gb  




  i mean i thought this would be something that doesnt happen until further down the line like im talking the last season of the show or something, but it looks like they want to get it out of the way. Anyone else think its too soon? 














 I dont understand why so many people seem to struggle playing him. Just spam q, whats so difficult about that? 




 So It looks they are going the DOFP route and are going to reset everything in the terminator universe or at least some major events in the universe and then start fresh from when ever the franchise is reset to. Are we ok with this? what if they erase the first 2 movies and essentially make them pointless cause of the reset? 









 3DM said by the end of this week? any news? 














 Lets take the hobbit for example, i see nothing wrong with it. ive enjoyed it right from the start and i love what peter jackson has done with middle earth and yet people still complain about silly arguments like too much CGI or he ruined the movie by adding stuff that wasn't in the book. but its not just the hobbit where im seeing this. 

The new star wars trailer for instance everyone is complaining about something whether it be the damn light saber or the lense flare near the millennium falcon or the CG in the teaser, yes ive seen people complain about that to. UGH. what is it with people and why cant we just enjoy what we have been given am I missing something here? 




 it could be a lot worse even if its only from people who have been to press screening reviews. 

http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_hobbit_the_battle_of_the_five_armies/

 




 You know its going to piss of the batman fans.  














 I thought it was really good even though the premise is kind of stupid i enjoyed it for what it was and it actually kind of worked for me despite it being a silly diluted plot it was still an enjoyable flick imo.  









 What type of stories would you like to see made in to movies? The obvious one would be an origin of gollum movie since we only catch a glimpse of it in return of the king and hear little tid bits of it through dialog, i think gollum is interesting enough to carry his own movie. Also one issue i can see being a problem is what would be the end game for a MECU? since LOTR is essentially the end any movies would have to take place prior to LOTR. Unless they came up with their own stories on what happens after LOTR but I cant really see what working well. Any ideas? 





























 Made a poll since im curious to see which version is more popular. Also perhaps explain in the comments what made you swing towards that paticular version. For me it was alpha sapphire because it has lugia and i like lugia more than Ho-Oh :)

http://strawpoll.me/3101987 




 I just bought alpha sapphire of the eshop. How long should the download take? 




 If your a gamer then youll know 2014 has been kind of shit for gaming at least imo. So many big titles have been delayed till next year which got me wondering. Why dont we hear about movies getting delayed as much as games? I mean sure we had the amazing spiderman 3 delayed this year to 2018 and as far as i know thats the only one this year. Though to be fair i dont keep up with movie news as much as i do video game news so I may be wrong on that part but if someone could enlighten me as to why movie delays dont seem to be as common id be interested to hear the reason behind it.  




 Who else agrees? 

In case you need your memory refreshed. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqO5wlwQcRI 




 im interested in movies like The Prestige and Now you see me.  




 In todays day in age with the likes of itunes and netflix. I feel like we should be at a point now where if we wanted to we could pay the price of a movie ticket and get to watch the movie at home in private the same day its released at the movies but it hasnt happened yet. Im just curious why?  




 I think my game might have glitched because im pretty sure ive done everything right up until this point. At 5:18 in this walkthrough there is a door that opens so you can get to the second pulse generator https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ekz6R_m-SE but the thing is in my game the door is red and refuses to open. ive killed all the flood and covenant but it its not opening. Any ideas.  









 Id be willing to pay something ridiculous for an epic game like that. 




 There were rumors about him being involved in the film. Was that his voice? doing the whole "there has been an awakening" dialog? it sounds a hell of a lot like his smaug voice but slightly altered.  









 I feel like its an appropriate thing to do.  




 I sated in the other thread that I thought the dark knight was the boring one of the trilogy mostly because of the dry Harvey Dent plot with all the politics while begins and rises are great action films the dark knight seemed more like a political spy thriller rather than a straight up action movie like the other 2 and may have been why i found it boring. Anyone else agree? 




 That bit of marketing always confuses me and it makes no sense. I mean if they mean that it will be in cinemas exclusively for a while then sure but other wise to me it makes no sense when we know it will be on dvd and bluray and itunes and all that later on so whats the point? 




 Got my xbox one yesterday and ive got a few downloadable games that im currently downloading would like to check on their status when im out. Is there a way i can check on them when im not home? 




 Anyone know if this weeks ep will be the last for the year? most of the shows I watch have ended for their fall finale.  









 Im expecting a bunch of emotional character close ups, maybe one VFX shot and one last shot of something that will make the fans have a WTF moment to build hype for the next year. I heard the last shot of the trailer is meant to be the villain holding vaders helmet or something? 




 cant afford to go the movies tonight so ill be watching something at home on the internet. Ill watch pretty much watch anything except for horrors and romantic comedies. so fire away.  




 Why hasnt it been posted yet? 




 It sucks use Imgur instead.  


































 Sherlock, Smaug and soon Doctor Strange. All tho I still need to see the Imitation game.  




 you realize its not coming out till march 2016 right? 









 Gone girl is good but not nightcrawler or whiplash good.  




 I know Im late to the party but my god that was amazing. It's easily tied for best picture along side Nightcrawler. Tho I still need to see other films like boyhood, raid 2 and imitation game but damn whiplash was incredible. That drum solo at the end. wow was that intense and every time J.K. Simmons came on screen my eyes were just immediately drawn to him, he has such an incredible presence its kinda scary and he just elevates everyone around him I mean Miles Teller as well that dude can act. Whiplash is easily in the top 5 movies of 2014.  




 I think sinister six will merge with amazing spider-man 3, that means sony can get one more movie out of Andrew Garfield and wrap up the trilogy properly. Then sell the rights back to marvel.  




 Awesome. i was looking forward to seeing this on the big screen again back when its original re release was cancelled. so Im looking forward to this. I saw ROTS 5 times when came out. Thought it was amazing then and I still do now. 









 The current generation haswell will be enough for a few more years at least even when the broadwell desktop parts come the performance increase wont be enough to warrant an upgrade it will be something silly like 5% IPC or some BS 




 I cant seem to find any games this morning and it says it cant retrieve my items from the inventory. Anyone else got this problem? 




 read his comment again, SLI doesn't always improve performance infact sometimes it can get worse because of how poorly optimized the SLI profile is for the particular game.  




 that's what im saying avoid $20 power supplies. they're cheap and are usually built with poor components. Thats what I meant by dont cheap out on the power supply.  




 you never want to cheap out on the power supply no matter how cheap your over all build is, one bad power supply and your pc could get fried.  




 Glorious set up brother! you should check ebay when you get more funds to get a nice cheap decent gpu.  









 From the announcement it doesnt sound like it.  




 have you tried playing the new game from telltale? its pretty damn good even if its just filler stuff.  









 wow, looking forward to playing the new pokemon on this.  




 I figured that since DA:I finally got cracked lords of the fallen would follow, but that doesnt seem to be the case. Anyone know if it will be cracked at all? 














 Got some left over christmas money to spend, wondering if I should pick this up. Is it good? 




 you might need a bios update. if I remember some amd bios were incompatible with some newer games.  




 So did The Dark Knight Rises, The way that whole plane sequence was shot was pretty incredible.  




 The Avengers. The way Loki makes his entrance is awesome.  














 Boyhood is also out in 720p 




 the year just started, have a little patience. Id be willing to wager that most of these if not all will be online by the end of the month.  









 we know it's sometime this month but do we have an actual date? 




 when did this trend start? was it for prometheus or before that? 




 They're filming this year however its not coming out till 2017. Why do they need an extra year and whats stopping it from making a 2016 release? seems a bit strange.  




 between now and the end of january is usually when it happens so fingers crossed.  




 it comes out in August thats more than a few months away but you are right. we should of had a teaser by now.  




 well at least I know a dvd screener is out their and hopefully it might leak! :D 




 Thing I hate the most is the awkward silence right after the trailers end and right before the movie starts everyone starts opening up their lollies and packets of chips and its like jeez. lol.  




 No. I hate eating during movies. I find it too distracting.  




 But what if the host doesnt want the baby from the start? why should she be forced to have it? its not fair on the child to be brought into a world where its not even wanted.  




 Completely agree with this.  




 this. plus No woman should be made to look after a child if she didnt want it from the start. I hate people that get all up tight about this subject about how if she didnt use protection then its her fault and she should keep the child but why should she if she never wanted it in the first place and it was a damn mistake?  




 I reckon seeing a live mammoth would of been pretty bad ass.
 




 Spiders,Snakes,Cockroaches. Seeing life sized versions of those would probably kill me lol.  




 When ever I tell someone online that I'm from New Zealand they go oh that's next to Australia right? Or Hey that's where Lord of the Rings was made. Usually its something along those lines. Why is this? Why do people seem to know nothing about my country?  









 I watched guardians of the galaxy for like the 10th time yesterday. 




 Im super pumped for it. Im all for anything to help fill the void while we wait for age of ultron and agents of shield to return.  




 Linux sux use a real OS like windows.  




 works for me so dont know about u guys.  




 I wont be getting my 970 till at least the end of February :( 




 They love teasing us :( 




 just buy a physical copy then? 









 Rockstar said they would be released in a couple of a weeks back in late December. So where are the system requirements? 




 did you even read the article? its for the half life 1 remake black mesa announcing its full release.  




 I totally forgot this game even existed.  




 just go to any pc vs console video and be amazed.  









 Thats never been confirmed outside of the leaked emails from November. Things could of changed since then.  









 Off the top of my head, this one from Iron Man 3 comes to mind https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv2bGsdizhM so bad lol. 




 Time Gem in Ant-Man and Soul Gem in Doctor Strange.  




 I pray to the marvel gods that they get spiderman back! pls sony just give up, make some sort of statement to the fans about wanting spiderman to have a better future, admit you made mistakes and move on.  




 Yus!!! hopefully this trailer is more story focused than the last couple.  




 Never seen the original Mad Max before and with the sequel coming out I was thinking I should watch it. Just wondering how does it hold it up today? Do I need to watch it or can I go into fury road blind with no knowledge of the original? 




 yea i was gonna say wtf man, taking your computer and tv sure thats what burglars do but to steal a mans bed? fuck your asking for trouble now son. A man needs his beauty sleep. 




 they never said it was half done filming. it never even made it to principal photography. But it was well into development. They were probably a couple of months away from filming when it was cancelled.  














 Draco Malfoy from the HP series.  




 i gave u an up vote because you were unfairly down voted. I want winter soldier or DOFP to be nominated for best picture so then the Comic book movie genre will be taken more seriously. I dont think a comic book movie has been nominated since the dark knight. the winter soldier and DOFP both deserve recognition for best picture. Ill probably get down voted for saying this but its true.  




 'All this hype. WHat if it turns out it was cut for a reason' You have to wonder how much rogue they actually filmed and decided to cut if their able to release another version based on Rogue. Im really curious to see it.  




 I watched this again for the first time in like 5 years, still cracks me up every time. Its one of the few comedies that legitimately get me laughing. what did you guys think of the movie? 









 65c isnt bad. That should not be causing a shutdown. whats the max temp for the 8320? i thought it would be like 90c max or something? 




 Im really interested to see how he pulled off the awesome Joker voice. Are there any documentaries or behind the scenes stuff that show how he did it?  









 Yup, no idea what the specs are tho its from 2005.  




 yea thought it might of been ebay. bad luck bro. always go to a decent company like Ibuypower or cyberpowerpc for prebuilts.  









 thats why i always check the channel directly. youtubes feed is shit period. it never seems to work for me.  




 just because someone has an AMD cpu or graphics card doesnt make them any less a part of the master race than you me or anyone else and I think a lot of you seem to forget that. Quite often ill see someone get down voted because they have an AMD rig. I want to know why is AMD thought off so negatively here on this subreddit?  




 This one? 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRd-CeWzZrs 




 i hope your right bro, id love it if we got the master chief collection and the gears of war games. Hell id be happy with those. but any future titles we get id consider a bonus. ms please all i want at least is halo and gears! 




 yea they do. Some of us actually liked titan fall and despite already owning destiny on ps4 I want it on PC for the superior visuals and just over all better experience.  




 id say its pretty much confirmed now. There were rumors like this with GTA V on pc right up until it was confirmed. All we need to do is a wait for bungie to confirm it, probably early next year. I have yet to finish destiny on ps4 so I may actually wait and play it on pc with a controller.  









 Snape in Harry potter and the deathly hallows part 2. 




 With only a few days left of the sale its currently at $13.74. Should I buy it now or wait till the last day just to make sure it doesnt get cheaper? 




 summer 2015 maybe? im just guessing.  




 probably less than 500w. A long the lines of the 970/980.  




 'The game I turned my consoles on for the most this year' hahaha well played totalbiscuit.  




 seriously? IMDB is trash. At least the forums are. I never found IMDB reliable at all.  




 And Andrew Bond? Can anyone explain? was Bonds father named Andrew? 




 A lot of people seem rather one sided about this, some think its cap others think its stark. I think its captain america. A large portion of the movie focuses on him and his back story. Though I can see why others would say its Stark.  




 Peter Jackson's King Kong? 




 I know what you mean OP! Im having trouble keeping my ambient room temperature down because of how tiny my room is. As soon as I shut my bedroom door my cpu temp rises because my ambient temp rises which pisses me off. So I have to keep my door open until I can afford a fan off sorts. 




 I5. better performance and a better upgrade path. 









 imagine if the harry potter movies were made now,Benedict Cumberbatch would of played voldemort.  









 I was just wondering about this because I remember before it was announced that Norton wasn't returning I remember reading heaps of rumors how the hulk was going to be tbe villain in the avengers and team was going to have to hunt him down because of how out of control he was getting, this was of course before Norton left the role. Did anyone else hear any similar rumors regarding the hulk in the avengers before Norton left? 




 Did someone order a pizz...I mean monitor xD 




 nice build. eventually you can upgrade to an i3 or i5.  




 I gagged while looking at this.  




 because the characters surrounding her a more interesting. you know your show is bad when your main character is less interesting than your supporting characters.  




 we are getting phantom pain next year so dont worry :) 




 you aint getting any karma from me son. Controllers are perfectly fine for FPS. 




 Because this game looks awesome. I'm sure a lot of people outside of korea want to play it. 

http://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/2m66gt/lost_ark_the_new_korean_hack_and_slash/ 




 did you flick the switch on at the back? 




 Intel. I used to be all pro amd but once you go Intel you can never go back.  




 lol i bet if you showed him the controllers working on your pc he would of said its fake even if you were playing a game right in front of him. sounds like hes one of those guys who searches for a movie trailer and calls it fake when its not lol.  




 I dont see anything wrong with it? don't act ungrateful.  




 TAG THIS MOFO! NSFMR!!! 




 This the exact upgrade I hope to make next year. I'm running a 660 myself. its a great card.  




 so does it still work? 




 thats kind of creepy.  




 Has anyone actually been able to see this yet? I heard finding a screening is like finding a needle in a haystack?  




 Thats fuckin amazing! its like an Frankenstein pc lol 




 yep your all good :) 




 you can play it just fine. those sites are highly inaccurate.  




 Thats not a bad rig, honestly you could just upgrade to a gtx 970 and you would be sweet. you might get a tiny bit of a bottle neck with that cpu but it would barely be noticeable.  




 I think this has to stop guys I mean look at this post http://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/2qei24/my_brother_has_become_a_peasant_today/

The guy makes fun of his brother because he got an xbox one for Christmas I mean isnt that taking it a bit too far? using it to insult someone? Its not a joke any more and especially during christmas calling someone a console peasant out side of this sub who has no idea what it means is rather insulting and vulgar. Anyone else agree? I hope the mods will at least consider it because Im sick and tired of seeing thie term used now and quite frankly its embarrassing.  




 Nice! Hope the build goes well :) 




 So I just noticed this just now, as soon as I open /r/pcmasterrace my temps spike from around 35-36C to about 45C and go back to 35-36C as soon as I close it. Is it because of the snow animation at the top thats causing the High cpu usage? anyone else getting this? this happens in both chrome and firefox. any other web page is fine.  




 I have a debit card so i'm just gonna deposit it straight in to my bank account. :) 









 just wondering, how do you know it was stolen? i know you said you saw the delivery guys coming down the street but how do you know it wast stolen did a neighbor or friend notify you? 














 correct. Broadwell will use LGA1150 the same socket as the current Haswell but Skylake which was mentioned above will use a new socket.  




 aye? i thought it was broadwell? only the mobile parts of broadwell are out we are still waiting for the desktop parts.  




 The next wave of Intel cpus is Broadwell which still uses LGA1150. however they are not due out till sometime next year. As far as im aware it wont be much of an upgrade over haswell unless someone can correct me? id stick with Haswell in a new build.  




 aye, its not free.  




 even worse now that rocket has basically left development to open up a new studio and start working on another game. you know its bad when the creator leaves and doesn't even want to finish his product.  




 and yet that guy spent over 200 hours playing it. obvious troll is obvious.  




 wot? 




 I'm among the few who enjoyed the first amazing spiderman but I havent even been able to get through the 2nd one yet. Its that bad. And I dont think its all of reddit, it just seems like that cause of how often its posted.  




 it says that all 10 of DCs upcoming movies are part of the same universe meaning that includes Shazam. This is coming directly from an official source now so there is no doubt this time.  




 the lord of the rings references lmao.  




 its possible the gameplay despite being from the pc version is that its running on a ps4 devkit which is essentially a pc with the same specs as a retail console.  




 aye inquisition is awesome. 




 I cant read any of what your friend added. 









 the New 3DS clearly states it doesnt come with a charger .its stupid I know. But this info has been known for a while now.  




 its ether FC4 or The Crew. Dont even bother with unity.  









 Even with that clarification he still doesnt sound too keen on the crossover happening.  




 Now that hes free from Ant-Man do we know if he has anything in the pipeline?  




 if it was a publicity stunt then why only give the movie in a limited release? seems like they are still taking the terrorist threats somewhat serious.  




 Nothing is gonna happen. its a bunch of fake wannabe terrorists trying to act tough behind a keyboard.  




 the 270x requires a 500w power supply so yours is more than enough. Its possible the power supply is on its way out and the timing is a just coincidence that it started happening when you put in your new 270x. perhaps put in your old 7850 and see if it still happens. if it doesnt happen then maybe its an issue with your 270x. what make and model is your power supply ?  




 This one?

 so no 950ti? seems like the 950ti would work really well on the new architecture.  




 how is he biased? he still uses intel in most of his rigs.  




 i have the entire collection on origin. its glorious.  




 already been posted.  









 Navy seals? aye more like ninjas lol.  




 thats a 970? huh it looked so small i thought it was a 750ti.  




 some people dont have time or just cant be bothered.  




 its back man.  




 its back! 




 the end of the world? 




 Your worrying too much, it will be fine. Some sites take a bit longer to update their shipping status.  




 Dam it! 









 wtf, i seriously hope your joking. your in some serious shit other wise.  




 you've probably bumped a cable loose some where, check they're all properly connected to the motherboard.  




 no begging.  




 we have them in EB games in Auckland.  




 Ive got a spare copy of half life 2 in my inventory and have been wanting to get cod 4 for a while now. Anyone want to trade? ill gift it to the person and then they can gift me?

 Just play games bro, i dont upgrade until i find a game i cant play.  




 So im trying to mod skyrim, But for some reason none of them are working and i have a feeling its because they're not in the right order. I heard some mods have to be specifically placed before or after other mods but i have no idea what i should be doing here. Any idea what order these should be in?

 Cry moar bitch.  




 For those wondering what im talking about, its when Linus pulls on the heat sink and its just dangling in the air.  









 im down for that! 




 This could actually be awesome. Imagine the crew of the enterprise pulling off an awesome space heist!  




 i think its creepy how much she looks like Brody.  




 because its so damn creepy how much she looks like Brody! 




 yea thats what i thought, I thought they might of aired the wrong episode because when Carrie and Dar are talking at the start i was like aye, did I miss something? this episode felt so out of place.  




 those episodes were golden compared to this crap we got.  




 got a source for this? 




 strange, i played this game for over 20 hours and never had an issue.  









 same, wish they would put Quinn and Saul in charge. would be so much better.  




 Anyone else get the feeing that there will be less Carrie and more Quinn and Saul next season?  Carrie basically doesnt have any reason to be on the show any more. Quinn is off doing his own missions and Saul looks like hes back at the CIA. Id love it if season 5 was Quinn and Saul doing mission together. Quite frankly I think Carrie's story has run its course, she said good bye to Quinn they no their relationship will never work. Quinn made that obviously clear when he left. I'm sure Carrie will still feature next season but hopefully as more of a supporting character, I really think she needs to take the backseat for a while and let the others shine. just my 2 cents.  




 Its fake. There are no legit torrents for the movie yet.  









 Here's a small recap trailer I found, it still missed out heaps of stuff but it covers the basic plot. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6V__oXbHeg 









 So in all his interviews recently, I don't know who keeps bringing it up whether its him or his interviewers but he keeps mentioning how he doesn't want people to think of guardians of the galaxy as an infinity war prequel and how he doesn't seem to fond of the guardians crossing over with the avengers and it all makes him sound rather arrogant imo because its not his decision to make where the guardians are placed in the MCU.

Now in all fairness I can understand that he wants guardians to stand on its own but guardians is part of the MCU that's never going to happen and its inevitable they will meet the avengers one way or another with or without Gunn. 

It seems to me that perhaps Gunn doesn't like where the MCU is going and Feige's vision as a whole since he even complained recently about writing Thanos in to guardians and how much trouble it was and how it was a plot that was just serving the avengers and didnt really add anything for the guardians and he doesnt want guardians to serve the avengers which again I can understand but its not his decision to make.  

Kevin Feige has a master plan hes the quiet puppet master who is pulling the strings behind the scenes and it seems like Gunn isn't too keen on following his vision. Not sure if its just me but that's the vibe im getting he wants guardians to stand on their own just how Edgar Wright wanted Antman to be standalone but that obviously wasn't going to happen and he had to be let go. 

It looks like Gunn might be in a similar position and hes starting to get rather vocal about his opinions (Which I think is good) but I hope he sits down and seriously thinks about what hes been saying before he gets in trouble with the higher ups at Marvel and Disney. 

We all know Marvel isn't afraid to change directors. I think what it comes down to is can Gunn and Feige come to a neutral agreement on who has the most control because it sounds like Gunn wants more control than he actually has. I'm only speculating here and more than likely Gunn is just messing with us and behind the scenes hes completely on board with the avengers and guardians crossing over (I hope anyway) however If worst comes to worst they may change director again and thats the last thing I want. Thats just my opinion though.   




 The PC isnt part of any generation. Its one constant platform. Its always changing.  You cant define it by a generation.  









 That's pretty cool. People hate on Microsoft for their lack of pc gaming support but this proves that at least someone at microsoft does care . 




 the best deals are usually on the last day. 




 This is an old article sony have said they are looking at different ways to release the movie sometime in the future. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-30559169 
























 Anyone want to guess where Thor and Hulk will be during this? I'm guessing Thor will be in Asgard dealing with Loki and trying to find out what happened to Odin and Hulk will possibly be off world? on his own intergalactic adventure if the rumors are to be believed. 
 














 The original release of GTA 5. I think the game was impossible to get on ether the 360 or ps3 for at least a week. At least in my area.  



















 Its still spider-man though. They don't have to market Miles Morales they just have to market spider-man.  




 If marvel and sony struck a deal to have Spider-Man in civil war but it was Miles Morales and not Peter Parker. How do you think people would react? would people care? I mean its still spider-man just not Peter Parker 




 I think a really cool franchise could be made out of Inception. It could be like the matrix mixed with a bit of bond/mission impossible action along with some spy thriller elements.And if they couldn't get DiCaprio to return then it could focus on the other members of the team and have the second and third film follow them around on other extraction jobs with an over arcing plot involving some sort of government conspiracy and cyber criminals and terrorists where they extract or plant ideas to prevent attacks and catch criminals etc. Any other ideas? 




 What on earth did I just watch? is this a porno? 




 it's gonna get a bit bumpy. 




 can we stop with the whole no pre order thing. this forum is about 5% of the total pc community. So its pointless telling people not to pre order it wont make a difference.  




 Interstellar would make a pretty sweet game.  














 This seems to be the "cool" answer to any half life 3 related post these days. But we all know you will still buy it day 1.  




 Halo and the possibility of a new Gears of war game in the future was my reason. I'm hoping microsoft will announce something awesome at this years E3 to make the purchase worth while other wise its just gathering dust.  









 they love it because it makes them feel special when they can say "my platform has this game so it must be better than your platform" and it also helps them justify their purchase even when they wont admit how crappy the console actually is.  









 Does anyone have any idea why marvel seem to have put it on the back burner for now? Everyone seemed damn sure we would get one in phase 3 but we didn't and now it looks like we might not even get one in phase 4. It looks like the Hulk will continue to be a supporting character in the avengers films which is kind of sad that marvel seem to be wasting Marks talent by using him once every 2-3 years for avengers films. Look I get that the Hulk isn't exactly an easy character to make a movie about due to him being a sort of anti hero if you will and it can be difficult to balance between Banner and Hulk but come on marvel give Hulk some love in phase 4 please! 




 Plus he lost to star lord in a humiliating dance off so who would want to return after that? 




 Your not gonna get that performance at $100. if you can add $40 you can get a 750ti.

 I read the 960 uses 120w max at laod. So would a 500w psu be enough for SLI? 




 he said buses haha.  




 370x is probably gonna be a beast.  









 OP has bad taste. 




 are you sure you saw John Wick? because the John Wick I saw was bloody awesome. Beautifully shot and had one of Keanu Reeve's best performances.  




 I finally got to see it yesterday and I think it may be Michael Caine's best performance yet. That scene where Murph visits Professor Brand in hospital just before he dies, I was holding back man tears. Time and time again Caine continues to impress and Nolan keeps bringing out the best in Caine. Looking forward to what he does next.  




 lame spot. its all seen it , been there.  




 Can someone explain the ending as simple as possible because I got a bit confused when we get the bit where cooper appears to fall in to the black hole and time itself and how he communicates with his daughter through the watch. just want some clarification on it.  




 bullshit. no way it will make it close to mockingjay or guardians.  




 Noooo!  




 Do we know for sure that this is going to be about the bounty hunters stealing the death star plans? I heard a few other sites saying that its going to be the Han Solo film? 




 I think the court room drama has actually been the most entertaining stuff so far.  




 Totally agree. I hope they do a sequel.  




 Fool of a took!  




 old post is old.  









 I might. I'm not a HUGE fan of the RE games but I enjoyed them for what they are.  




 i say its Merlin cause in the promo you see him talking to team arrow and he presents the weapon Raz used to kill oliver. So how could of he gotten it if he wasn't there? 




 My planet just got Annihilated 




 You have to say it in the awesome Korean accent!  




 I'm guessing its Merlin.  




 aw 




 With Oliver potentially out of the picture for a while will Felicity give Barry a heads up on what happened?  




 Oliver will be dead the rest of the season until next season when Barry goes back in time and saves him.  




 Plot twist. They do another arrow vs flash crossover where barry goes back in time and saves him.  




 To be fair I didnt even notice till I saw this. So they must of done something right.  









 run some benchmarks for a an hour or so and check the temps.  




 yea this is a really interesting site. You can find other game companies on it to even VALVE.  




 sure you were drunk...  




 aye, its $109 on psn and xbox live.  




 wont work. they will deny your credit/debit card.  




 I enjoyed it. A lot of people are saying its average and doesn't deserve all the Oscar nominations it got but I disagree I think it does. Its a great film and its one of Bradley Coopers best performances. I hope ether American Sniper or Whiplash win Best picture.  









 its like the matrix meets superman.  









 The only reason Boyhood might win imo is because of the whole 12 year process behind it and Birdman wont win because its such a mixed bag. You ether like it or dislike it. Mean while Whiplash is more grounded and has great performances all round and its got the technical awards behind it to for best editing and sound which past best picture winners usually have as well.  




 Everyone seems to think whiplash is the under dog this year. Saying their happy its been nominated but no way it will win. I actually think it might. Anyone else?  




 even if thats the case it will pop up some where else quick enough.  




 cant tell if sarcasm or serious....  




 and me  




 unless you know someone in china who could buy it for you and  then gift it to you then yea your probably out of luck.  




 Under the mountain. I know Sam Neil did that real budget looking film but it was kinda crap. Would like to see a proper franchise made out of it.  




 Just buy the pc bro. your only going to more douche bags here trying to force you to build one.  




 If you dont want to build one dont. Ill get down voted for saying that but its your money and if your more comfortable getting a pre built then get it. Cyber pc are great. Highly Recommend.  














 yea the unfortunate side effects of ageing. I think DOFP was probably the last time well see these two together on screen as X-Men.  




 how long did you test it for? you can test for over 10 hours and still have an unstable overclock. These sound like symptoms of a bad oc.  




 It obviously means your oc is not stable.  









 anyone else think they should of attached it to ant-man instead? that movie could of done with the boost of ticket sales. Avengers 2 doesnt need the extra box office its already going to be a hit.  




 There has been an awakening, have you felt it? 









 So Im a bit confused about the time line in the upcoming x-men apocalypse film. Since everything has been reset in DOFP. Does apocalypse take place in a new universe post time line reset or is it before the reset? Im guessing its before since the original cast wont be returning because all of the x-men will be too young for the original actors . But its been confirmed for a while now that Hugh Jackman will return as Wolverine. So how does that work ? or will it be like DOFP and some of it will be in the past and future at the same time? 




 its their money they can spend it how they wish.  



















 I think they sometimes do an easter sale cant verify that tho.  




 he could saved up for a couple months on a really tight budget? you dont know his current circumstances.  




 Matthew Vaughn Approves this shit! 




 Welp I could log in and get to the server list now its back to the way it was before, I cant even log in.  




 But the wait time is over an hour and half. WTF.  




 So I bought the game on steam and now im having trouble making an account. Do I have to use the same email as my steam account and do I have to use the same username as my steam account or not? im kinda confused. Because its saying my account doesnt have access.  




 Sony Offline Entertainment 




 I think it might of been too "out there" for the academy if that makes sense and it doesn't help that it wasnt released during oscar season.  









 Been trying for the last hour, no luck. Is anyone besides a couple of twitch streamers actually playing? 




 the entire franchise hinges on her being in the movie! 




 Just watched the film and im just wondering about the end. Did the investigation ever find out why the veteran Chris was helping killed him? I want to avoid going into conspiracy theories if possible but Im just curious about what happened.  









 what a weird month to push it back to. Like I can understand wanting to be on oscar season but why not November? Their brave releasing it so close to star wars. 




 http://variety.com/2014/tv/news/sherlock-season-4-2015-special-4-episode-1201256929/

The new season will consist of a special episode, which will begin filming in January 2015, and three episodes, which will commence production later in the year and will likely appear in early 2016. 




 season 4 will film later this year. when it airs idk. Right now their just filming the special.  




 i liked the amazing spiderman 2 so i actually want a third film.  




 inb4 left 4 dead is actually the superior game lmao.  














 Avatar

This trailer was beautifully put together, its a shame the movie didn't quite live up to the hype that came from it. Still enjoyed the final product tho. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PSNL1qE6VY

Spiderman 3

This trailer got me so damn excited for venom and it still does. Just wish they could of done better by the character. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bzqHbTD64w

Inception

As great as inception was I still think its trailers were better than the movie itself especially this one the action, music and sound design in the trailer was miles above anything that was actually featured in the movie itself.  Still a great film tho again another one that was way over hyped thanks to a great trailer. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66TuSJo4dZM
 




 I hope whiplash gets nominated for best picture.  









 I wont believe it till we get an official announcement. Ive been burned too many times by latino review. Id say there's a 50% chance is this is legit but wait till something official.  









 http://www.nintendo.com/nintendo-direct/01-14-2015/

Do you think well get any information regarding the 2015 pokemon game? or is it too soon? 




 I kinda wish Brandon Routh wasnt cast as the atom now that way he could of been superman in supergirl.  




 noo! are you crazy? the ending was phenomenal the way it is!  




 fuck, for some reason I first read this as avengers 2. Almost gave me a heart attack.  




 Would you ever consider directing a super hero movie for ether marvel or DC?  









 He was obviously joking you people need to learn how to detect sarcasm.  














 that's probably the truth of it to be honest It doesn't make financial sense for rockstar to have a team as large as the console development team working on a pc version they probably have like 5-10 guys working on the pc port who have no knowledge of how the pc architecture actually works they just assume that everything will translate smoothly because of the x86 architecture used on the new consoles but now their finding out that its actually not that easy.  




 you cant be stupid enough to think he was being serious? 




 it kind of is. I mean if you look back at something like the watchdogs delay that was like what a whole 6 months? to compare to something like that 2 months is a slight shift i guess its just how one interprets it.  




 I cant believe you people thought he was actually serious. He was obviously joking.  




 If I had to pick one Id say its because March is the end of their fiscal year so its just all 'money money money. 
 




 he was obviously joking , did you actually think he was serious? no one would ever do that.  




 I already have a ps4 and xbox one along with my pc. So it doesnt really matter.  




 Heck no. If your getting fps issues the problem lies else where.  




 the people having performance issues are the ones who have bottle necking issues. Their cpu is probably not up to the task. Like dont do something stupid and pair a 970 with a pentium cpu. ofc you will get bottle neck.  









 I will still buy it on PC when it comes out dont worry about that I just really want to play it right now. ive been waiting since last year when it came out on ps4/xb1.  









 I said to myself if it was delayed again Im gonna give on the pc version and just get it on console and that's exactly what Im doing. sorry guys but **** this. Im getting it on ps4 next week. Ive waited long enough to play this.  




 their talking about cpu cores.  




 I said to myself that if it was delayed again im gonna  give up on the pc version and get it on console and that's exactly what Im doing. sorry guys but **** this. Im getting it on ps4 next week. that's just how it is. I still have my pc but its time like these where my faith in Gaben tested. 




 Well I said to myself if it was delayed again ill give up get it on console and that's exactly what Im doing. sorry guys but **** this. Im getting it on ps4 next week.  




 Yes it does! the ending was too open ended, I want to see Christopher return with a huge as army of prawns and **** shit up.  




 ok here are some of mine.  

Star Wars will flop and all of Disney's future plans for the franchise are scrapped it becomes the biggest flop of all time. 

Furious 7 will be another smash hit in the fast and furious franchise spawning 3 more sequels. set for release in 2017,2019,2021 respectively. 

Avengers age of ultron will top  avatars 2 billion dollars at the Box office. the huge success will cause marvel to change some of its phase 3 plans and bring avengers infinity war part 1 forward to 2017 and part 2 in 2018. The other films will have their dates shifted slightly but phase 3 will remain intact. 

Ant-Man will be a surprise hit. Marvel will announce a sequel but will not give a release date. Many will suspect it wont be released until phase 4. 

In February Marvel and Sony announce that Spiderman will return to marvel with a new trilogy of films, the first film will be announced for 2017 starring Andrew Garfield, Garfield will also feature in avengers infinity parts 1 and 2 with a cameo in Captain America: Civil War. As part of the deal sony will get a portion of the box office earnings.  

The Avatar sequels finally begin principal photography in Wellington, New Zealand. 

After the huge success of the final hobbit film. At comic con 2015 Warner bros announces a middle earth cinematic universe.Peter Jackson will be the creative visionary behind the universe he will be the WB version of Kevin Feige, the first film will be a trilogy of films based on the origin of the Witch King of Angmar the first film would release in 2017. 

At comic con 2015 warner bros announces that batman v superman is split into 2 films with part 1 releasing in October and part 2 in march. 

Fantastic Four is another surprise hit. making around $450 million at the box office. Fox is slightly disappointed but they still go a head with the sequel and believe they can make this new iteration of Fantastic Four into a money making franchise.  




 What an awesome movie. Beautifully shot. Especially the fight scene at the end reminded me a bit of the neo vs smith fight from the matrix with the rain and lightning in the background. So good.  This movie may have rebooted Keanu Reeves career in the best way possible. Lets hope he takes advantage of this success and we see him in more of these roles.  




 yea boi! NZ bros! 




 Doesnt this line from stark basically confirm he's the one who makes ultron? 









 I think the recording is gonna play a big part in the trial now.  









 Im going on holiday in Bali for a week in February from the 11th to the 18th which means Ill be missing out about a week of my course. Since I receive living costs and have an active Student Loan, will I need to contact them even though its just a week?  




 Comes out in April for me! so hyped.  




 April master race! so hyped! 




 yea it is.  









 Since bay is apparently out, they will need to having someone already working on it if they plan to make the projected 2016 release date. Any ideas who they might of picked? 




 Ive had it on my battle net account for a while but never bothered to give it a try. is it any good? worth trying out? 




 Furious 7.  




 There's still time to announce a delay.  




 I like how it acknowledges that its a parody of a Hollywood blockbuster. 




 it's not in the same universe so it doesn't matter.  




 Hes got a very particular set of skills,skills he has acquired over a very long career. so why not use them? let him do taken 4 imo 




 After seeing Whiplash I think he could pull it off. At times his character felt very isolated and was dealing with his own personal issues just like peter parker does and he played that very well. Not sure how well he would pull off spiderman tho. I've only seen him in whiplash so maybe someone else can chime in with their thoughts.  




 This just getting ridiculous and out of hand. Poor bloke needs help.  




 you can see the detail must be running at ultra, 4k, 60 fps. 









 you'd be surprised what they spoil in trailers these days. I would not be surprised at all if they spoiled something like that and used it as the big money shot of the trailer.  




 that makes no sense? if the game is on steam then the keys should be able to activate on it? 




 you know hes probably joking about buying the game right? 




 if its not delayed we should get something within the next 2 weeks. tho knowing rockstar we might not get anything till the day it comes out.  




 there's still 2 weeks till release calm your tits.  




 That is clean.  




 I check it every 5 minutes! 




 im talking about sam betraying rogers to team up with stark in civil war. This has nothing to do with Hydra.  




  .

that could actually make a really cool plot. Imagine the look of betrayal on rogers face when his second best friend next to buck betrays him. 




 You have to remember that what happens to Odin all depends whether or not Anthony Hopkins decides to return for Thor: Ragnarok.If he returns then obviously he could be alive just in Odin sleep or if he doesnt return then they have an excuse to kill him off.  




 I actually like SC 2013 come at me bro 




 DAMN IT I FELL FOR IT! 




 Shouldn't the game have gone gold by now? why haven't we heard anything about the pc version finishing development? 




 we just got the witcher 3 requirements and that's not out till May. Something is going on here and I don't like the Silence.  




 Does anyone find it weird steam still says early 2015 and not january 27th? Normally games this close to release have a countdown showing how much time their is till release. Maybe rockstar isnt putting january 27th on the steam page in case they do need to delay?  




 Been a while since I last heard news about it. Is it still happening? 




 your doing it wrong man. i live in New Zealand and never pay more than $65 for a new release game. And games are expensive as shit here. Thank GabeN for online Key stores.  




 what on GabeN's earth is this? no offence but this is a terrible build. You can do a lot better for that price. Hope you didnt buy this yet. This one is better. http://pcpartpicker.com/b/ZB9WGX 




 Dude Ikr! the GOW1 port is so good. It runs really well. Makes me sad Cliffy B never put the second or third game on pc cause of pirating.  




 we need to show developers that we support pc games. Too many developers are scared of putting their games on pc cause of people downloading them and if we ever want halo or gears of war back on pc gta v will need to do well in sales to convince other developers that the pc game market is still strong and that its worth the time and money to have an extra team during development to make a pc port.  









 I remember back in high school stealing chocolate bars from my local super market and putting them down mah pants...back in the day. I was young and shit and quite the rebel to ,hehe.i remember being pretty good at it to tbh. I also remember getting away with some whipped cream and later spraying some of it all over some poor buggers car and then threw it down a ditch some where on my home. I also remember getting a way with a copy of Command and Conquer tiberian sun from a local computer store. 




 This movie is awesome.I loved the animation and Baymax was an awesome character. Hope they do a sequel and this is easily in my top 10 movies of 2014. 




 Na the ending will more than likely involve ether Fury,Stark or Rogers visiting him and offering him to join the avengers.  




 All disney have said is holiday 2015 so around the time the force awakens is released.  




 use pcsx2 and play em? 




 up vote for dat edginess.  




 After seeing whiplash him being in spiderman 2 made me appreciate that movie a little more.  




 Before Iron Man 3 came out I remember reading that Disney decided against using the Demon in a bottle story line and went with PTSD instead.Any idea why it didn't make the final cut? I'm still kinda hoping we get some hints or nods of Demon in a bottle in future films especially with Civil   Infinity War coming up.  









 ill probably get downvoted for this but wouldnt it be bad for their sponsorship with antec to do this? 




 Damn the reference cooler is sexy as hell.  









 your cpu is a bit of a bottle neck.  




 this is my favorite part of attack of the clones.  









 I would of also cut the joke at the end about changing the name. it still ruins a other wise seriously toned trailer. But other wise good job :) 




 This looks awesome! There is no stopping marvel now boys!  




 These things are pointless imo.  




 Isn't it supposed to be out by now? 




 because it would of been weird. seeing the guy who's gonna be vision in the future playing a character in the past 




 Maybe next year ill get a 4k TV. Hopefully by then they'll drop in price.  


































 everything looks great except for Iron Mans suit. Looks so photo shopped.  









 Titanic. But If I had to pick a recent score It would have to be Interstellar.  




 Its all about taste and all film is subjective. Your not going to like every single film.  









 just watching 1080p youtube videos id probably use that up in a few days.  









 Thor dies, Cap then gets to use the hammer? 




 I guess that makes sense. But Id hope that we would be able to figure out a way around that limiation.  



















 Oh god. this movie is gonna suck.  




 I think its been put on the shelf for now. My guess is Fox will wait and see how FF does before revisting it since Josh Trank will have also signed on to direct FF2. So we may not get a sequel till after FF2 and even then Trank has his star wars movie to do. So if Chronicle 2 does happen it wont be directed by Trank.  




 is that including spectre or still 2 more after spectre? 




 Ok seriously can we stop already?  





























 TL;DR LOL 




 This article is from last year. Old news.  




 If it still turns on you might just need to replace the hard drive. Or the hard drive could of come loose due to the amount of force. Open her up and check.  









 its cheap, constantly updated with new content. Its original content is even better than some of its licensed content (Looking at you House of Cards). Easy to switch regions with a VPN etc. Compatible with lots of devices. Its just that good.  




 Netflix.  














 You could try the Pelangi Hotel in Seminyak  




 Damn that's complicated to look at.  




 Apparently its 145 minutes according to my local cinema. Just in case anyone wanted know.  




 Their laptops are actually decent.  




 Is still shit.  




 If Captain America: Civil War has spider-man I reckon it has a decent chance.  




 So the last episode was called the return and we got a surprise guest apperance from Manu Bennett as slade. The episode implied that Bennet was returning as Slade but he didn't really did he? he ended up back in Prison and imo It was more of a guest apperance than a return. A return to me would of been him escaping so he could of been used later on. I just found the episode title a bit misleading.
 









 Why didn't disney at least give the second one a go before canning the franchise? they could of at least wrapped up the story properly with one more film. And besides, It could of been one of those franchises that picked up steam through dvd,bluray and VOD sales. So much wasted potential. :(  




 A lot of people don't have the technical know how to figure out how to use Netflix,Hulu and torrents etc. Some people still cant afford internet. Also some people just prefer the social aspect of sitting down and watching TV with a bunch of friends rather than being anti social and watching it on a laptop or something. TV is a very social thing for a lot of people.  









 With all the spin offs and what not. When do you think disney will reveal the entire slate? perhaps at star wars celebration?  




 Is anyone else worried that Sony is selling off its TV and smartphone divisions and wants to invest more in PlayStation? I mean what if their investment fails to return a profit in 3-4 years time? would Sony consider selling the PlayStation brand as well? The last thing the gaming industry needs is a monopoly controlled by Microsoft. Nintendo really doesn't have any stake in the industry anymore like MS and Sony currently do. Would you guys still support PlayStation if it was purchased by another brand like Samsung? 














 Oooh season finale perhaps?  




 I mean come on. Do you really think CBS is just gonna let this show end? give it a year or two maybe three. But it will be back in some way. Mark my words this aint the last we've seen of it . 




 The new spider-man actor and director
Captain Marvel director
Infinity War director(s)?
Thor Ragnarok director
Black Panther director
Inhumans director
Confirmation of Spidey in Civil War
Agent Carter season 2
Agents of Shield season 3
New Avengers line up for infinity war

Did I miss anything?
 









 why not just download it all at once? its annoying when you have slow internet. Id rather wait a bit longer but at least be able to play it without interruption.  




 well thats stupid.  




 So I just started playing the order 1866 and I just watched the cut scene after you kill the lycan with the lightning gun and now the game seems to be downloading something again. its currently at 55% and 60 minutes remaining. wtf is going on?
 









 human centipede 




 There should at least be a temporary logo until an official one is released.  



















 its a tv show. the contract wont be that binding like it would for a movie.  




 there's nothing stopping it from happening. That's actually great casting.  




 I wanted spider-man back but not like this. Why move everything? they could of easily had another film in 2017. I'm happy civil war and guardians of the galaxy 2 seem unaffected though.  




 everyone noticed this. Your just late to the party.  




 They wont be taking money from each other. They are both Disney films. Disney would still get money ether way.  




 Why delay any of them? they would still make money. imagine the nerdgasms. Avengers and Star Wars a couple of months apart. Would be madness. But awesome madness.  




 Its not paid DLC for Unity. Its a complete game.  




 Oh god yes! but ONLY if the movie is ready in terms of VFX and editing and what not.  









 Not bad. Looks like your all set to go. Huge fan of those EVGA power supplies. So underrated, more people should use them.  




 So a week from now I'm considering upgrading my graphics card and with the launch of the 960 the price of the 760 will now drop. So I'm wondering do the new feature's and the performance increase of the 960 out way the benefits of a 760? or should I just go with the newer 960.  




 I like pc as much as consoles. Why is it wrong for someone to like both? Not only that I think its stupid to sell a console for a new pc case when the value of the console outweighs the value of a new case.
 




 nope.  




 I don't see how one can film a movie like that with at least some of the cast members feeling awkward on set. I mean what if they down right refused to film a sex scene because of how outrageous it was? I haven't heard anything like that happening for fifty shades just used it as an example. I'm just curious how a director would handle a film like this?  









 that's the most stupid idea ever heard. no way I would sell a ps4 for a case.  




 I can never understand these posts. if its your money just buy the damn case.  




 Netflix gets new episodes weekly.  




 it will be quicker than dude, have you ever use tpb before? its like 10 minutes tops after it airs.  




 so watch it later on netflix? 




 I think an official discussion then a late comers discussion would be good. But it might be a bit too much for the mods.  









 I mean unless they go back in time some how it doesn't make sense but this is moffat we are talking about how so ofc nothing is as it seems.  









 Walter White. All he wanted to do was secure a future for his family before he died and the only way he could think of doing that was by cooking meth.  









 Im more interested in the process behind how marvel got to where they are today. I really enjoyed how star wars conquered the universe because of that reason it went so in depth into how star wars got to where it is today.  









 So get this, In the newest trailer there is a shot of Jason stathams Ian Shaw blowing up a car, next shot you see Dominic looking all sad at a photograph of his family .I think Shaw kills Brian and Universal is hiding it pretty damn well. What do you think? Here's the sequence im talking about. http://imgur.com/a/s10Zi now this could be just the way the trailers cut but it seems kinda obvious now that Shaw will kill someone close to Dom whether its Brian I cant say for sure but why else have that shot with the family photo with Brian in the center? 




 aye you see them plenty in both of the trailers. calm down. They are a major part of the plot they were even in the winter soldier post credit scene.  




 I might have been living under rock but I haven't seen this yet. Should I check it out? 




 that was more of a joke than a controversy tbh. North Korea just got Butt hurt someone decided insult their great leader.  




 I would of thought Selma would of gotten more controversy due the subject of the film but man American Sniper, It seems like every day a new article pops up adding more fuel to the fire. Are there any films as controversial as American Sniper? 




 it was announced by fox ages ago along with a march 2017 release date for another wolverine sequel.  




 Since when do you tip Pizza deliveries? we dont in NZ.  




 Heading there on Wednesday for the first time. Staying for a week. Any thing a first time visitor should do and places to check out? 




 I liked interstellar's theory on this. In the movie they claim that the U.S faked the moon landings to bankrupt the soviet union.  



















 Did a quick Google didn't find anything.  



















 Poltergeist. If you never want to sleep again.  




 you wot m8? your complaining about 250fps? wow.  









 . Windows server 2008 data center can handle up to 2tb of ram. 
http://blogs.technet.com/b/markrussinovich/archive/2008/07/21/3092070.aspx 









 It might go better than you think it will. I've heard stories of  EVGA sending back newer models of their card because its no longer in production. You might get back ether a 760 or 960.  




 actually can its called IGN 




 GTX 960.  









 Yep lol.  




 CW YOU HAVE FAILED THIS CITY! 




 Oh yes. That star trek trailer was amazing. The way they cut the trailer to Freedom Fighters from Two Steps From Hell. Still gives me chills.  




 I got mine from study link. Here in New Zealand .Its basically a subsidiary set up by the government and offers interest free student loans. You can also get a student allowance which is free but is dependent on how much money your parents make which will impact how much you get per week. Or you can get living costs which you have to pay back on top of your student loan up to $175 a week.  














 Good way to look at imo. The i7 will be able to play newer games longer than the i5.  




 eh? both are solid ports imo. They did have resolution issues at launch but I'm pretty sure they have been patched now.  



















 I cant take anyone seriously when they start their argument with "fuck" 









 All film is subjective. Gourlami is allowed to like wolverine origins if he wants.  




 I love that line. Don't know why. Just do.  




 Damn this looks good. Might be more hyped for this than Age of Ultron.  




 its still too early. It aint out till march next year.  









 Aint happening, any talk of a sequel died when the abysmal box office numbers came in for the second film.  




  Im guessing with Age of Ultron? I'm seriously hyped for this movie. I want to see more.  









 Since Marvel don't seem interested to back a big budget film for the Hulk, why not go the Netflix route? Del Toro was already working on a live action tv show for ABC haven't heard anything in a while tho. Maybe they could jump start it again now that they have Ruffalo? 




 I cant find any copies online and normally its up by now. Anyone know whats going on? it did air today right? 
























 Well this is interesting. 

http://blog.ubi.com/ubisoft-quebec-studio-spotlight/ 









 lol bs pics or it didn't happen.  




 if you compare the figure on the far left to how Paul actually looks in the scenes he did manage to get filmed you'll see he looks nothing like the figure. The figure is far to thin and the head just looks wrong. plus its awkwardly placed away from the rest of the cast. It must be one of his brothers who then had their head switched out with Paul's during post.  














 Its beautiful.  




 did you even watch the first movie? Dom and his crew were pulling of heists all the time like stealing dvd players and shit.  




 Big hero 6 




 Are people still pissed that superman killed zod? Personally I'm ok with it. I mean, if he didn't kill Zod, Zod would of killed the family and then kept on killing people. Zod left superman no choice. I get that superman killing people is wrong and goes against everything he stands for but I think it was an interesting and ballsy take on the character by Snyder. What do you guys think? 




 So this semester I have to get a laptop. I'm pretty much settled on the Asus ROG G551JM. Just wanted to see what people here thought of asus laptops. Are they of good build? do they last long etc? 




 How does Disney proceed with the franchise? do they keep going and try and make episode 8 better? or do they scrap the franchise completely? id assume they would keep going because they've poured to much money in to it already it would be pointless to stop.  









 2 years is the norm for marvel films, whats so unusual about it? 3 years your starting to get the point where fans will be complaining there taking too long.  




 Jaws 




 Best thing would be some chocolate bars, and whipped cream.  














 I think you should wait for amd to announce the 300 series. the 300 series might end up being better than the Nvidia's 900 series. Dont just jump on the nvidia bandwagon because everyone else is . Just my 2 cents.  









 we run windows. Decent size screen would be nice 15.6-17inch, light to medium gaming so some mobas,cs go, f2p games like nosgoth, the ocasional AAA title like tomb raider etc. No special ports required. Portability would be nice i don't want anything to heavy.  









 Doesn't that defeat the purpose of having an i7? I thought i7's were meant to be quad cores?  




 I'm not afraid to admit that ive done this, a few of my facebook posts ive posted were to try and make me seem cool but I failed pretty hard.  




 I've had a couple of pavilion laptops over the past 4 years both died due to over heating issues. Is this still a thing? or should the pavilion line up be avoided like the plague and is it worth stepping up to the Hp's envy laptops? 





























 Stephen king's the dark tower comes to mind. I have little faith the movie will be any good if and when ever it gets made its just so complex.  




 I mean why does avatar need 3 god damn sequels and we cant get one battle angel movie :(  




 Apollo 13 




 Looking for something that takes a scientific approach yet has all the fun of a good ghost scary ghost hunt. 

 




 How are they not done filming yet? WTH.  









 No, they clearly state that recommended specs will run at 30. Read again. All tho they say they are aiming for the most performance possible for now it looks like recommended specs will run at 30.  




 Here's the link to the original polish interview. 

http://www.gry-online.pl/S018.asp?ID=1132


PC recommended specs will be able to run the game on 30 or 60 frames per second? 

I think, we'll stick with 30 FPS. We're not going to stop working on performance until the very end, it's crucial matter to us, there are different PCs with different specs. Programmers insisted on avoiding tricking the players by lowering predicted specs. As I mentioned before, It can only get better. 









 You sure that's it? I thought it was the plane that looked like the plane bane used from the dark knight rises? 




 should of got it directly from steam 




 yea its bullshit. 









 Ok I stand corrected. But usually the oscars do seem to prefer the higher rated films.  




 My computer will probably catch fire trying to play this.  




 I loved episode 3. Saw it 5 times when it came out. I still get chills when Anakin turns to the dark side.  




 It wasn't rated high enough on rotten tomatoes. sad but true. The oscars seem to favor movies rated 85-100% anything lower doesnt get recognized.  









 err how does she know when its your birthday? 




 what did she do then? when she found out one of her kids did it? 




 I have a 360,Wii,Ps3,Ps4,Xbox one and I think I have an N64 and PS2 around some where. Plus my gaming pc ofc. 




 same, here's how Id do it. At the end of AOU Banner is shot into space after cap and falcon break him out of a government holding cell set up by stark after banner looses control of the hulk, cap tells banner that its the only way hell remain free but cap tells banner hell call upon him when hes needed again.Eventually his craft crashes into Knowhere, Banner makes his way out of the crashed craft he looks up we see groot smiling at him and he says I am groot, end scene.  









 That's bullshit, I mean unless said third party stole the keys then they should be legit. wtf Ubisoft.  




 Anyone got a decent 24/7 OC going on this card? looking to OC to try and improve performance on some newer games that are coming out.  




 Ant-Man got pushed forward from November to July.  




 Wow. That's huge! Paramount must be well ahead of schedule for a drastic move like this.  




 I think this scene is really important. It tells you up front what phase 2 is about. It even foreshadows the events that occurred in the winter soldier with hydra being mentioned and how they will use weapons of mass destruction on civilians.  









 I preodered it you mad.  




 we don't know this yet, Bucky could still play a major role in civil war especially if stark finds out he killed his father.  
























 Well at least he made his point.  



















 I think it's SHIELD 2.0 I think some agents from Agents of Shield may cameo at the end as well. Who else are they gonna get to run it? Would be awesome if Coulson returned for a cameo as well.  









 Good lord. That cpu cooler.  




 some people don't have room for a desktop and a desktop doesn't have the portability of a laptop.  




 can you post the temps in Celsius please? I hate trying to read temps in Fahrenheit. 









 That's what I mean. With Civil War marvel has now dug themselves into a hole they cant get out of. Now in future solo movies they'll have to come up with some crap excuse as to why Cap cant help out Black Panther or something because after Civil War fans will be questioning these things more and more.  




 After civil war everyone is going to be asking why Iron Man isn't in Guardians of the Galaxy 2 or why Captain America isn't in Thor Ragnarok. I think marvel have created an in inescapable situation here with civil war where they have essentially killed their own solo films by making civil war basically avengers 2.5 and now all the fans will be wondering why certain characters wont be in other characters solo films. Is the age of the solo film done? 




 FlashForward. That cliffhanger had me in tears. still pissed they canceled it.  



















 One weeks not so bad I guess. Hopefully they do it soon and get it out of the way.  




 Anyone know if there will be any more 2 week breaks or will it be a straight run to the season finale from here? 





























 Just had a look on the receipt and I don't see anything. 




 I bought a 970 last week. How do I get my free copy of the witcher 3? 




 is it even on netflix anymore? according to https://netflixaroundtheworld.com/ its not.  




 Just curious.  














 Great. Just what we need more movies about American patriotism. Look don't get me wrong I enjoyed American Sniper but why does everyone have to jump on a bandwagon.  
























 Beautiful.  




 Maybe hes adding a bit of spider-man to it? 



















 yea by 1%  





































































 its like marvel cant seem to make up their mind how much of this movie is officially canon. They have referenced it since its release but when ever marvel talks about is past It always feels like the incredible hulk gets pushed to the side. What does r/movies think? is the incredible hulk canon in the MCU despite marvel kind of acknowleding it.  














 Any chance it will be with inside out? 














 For a second there I thought Sky was gonna leave Shield. I mean they set it up perfectly if they wanted to go down that route.  




 OP doesn't know how to enjoy movies.  




 Nightcrawler, end of watch 



















 Its really annoying since its stops other games showing as being in game.  




 Figured it out. just took a bit of tinkering in EVGA precision. got my fans at 30% and the 970 is now sitting at a nice 37C.  




 hmm if you say so. its just compared to my old gtx 660 which would sit at around 40c while browsing with the fans on this is quite hot in my books. I guess I'm just not used to the new 900 series cards and how they work.  




 yea but right now im using chrome watching a 1080p movie trailer and its sitting at 49c. seems a bit hot.  




 How do I get the fans to run? I know they don't start running till about 60c on the EVGA ACX 2.0 model. I tried playing around with precision x but its kinda confusing. I want my fans to run at a low speed 24/7. Is this possible? 




 AMC movie talk.  




 So much this! I wish the larger fan base would hurry up and figure this out. It was never about the cars or the action it was always about family.  









 No offence but you just wasted your money.  









 By this time last year we already had confirmation of season 3. But yet this year we have no word on season 4. Any ideas when we might get a confirmation? 




 Pretty high I reckon. Unless they replace him with a new character to fill his spot.  




 I was thinking Thanos needs an army right? what if he summons all the villains in the MCU to team up with him to fight the avengers. This could be anyone from Abomination to Red Skull.  Who would you have on team Thanos if this were to happen?

 




 This might be the best city builder since Sim City 4 imo. I'm having fun just watching streams. The gameplay looks incredibly engading and addicting and it looks like its got some real depth to it. Can it be Tuesday already? :D 




 In regards to Thor I was talking about Malekith. 




 It seems like Loki is the only villain marvel have seem to have gotten right in the MCU. Bucky was also a pretty decent villain in TWS so marvel do seem to be learning and hopefully they'll knock it out of the park with Ultron. But it seems like with Thor and Iron Man they struggle a lot to make engaging and interesting villains. Why is that? Are their writers just having trouble grasping the source material or are they just surrounded by yes men who have no idea wtf they're doing? 




 Cause too much water, am i rite? 




 I know that. Why do you think I'm going for the 970 . 




 Exactly.Plus I don't have $1000 to spend.  




 980s are over a $1000 here in NZ.  




 http://www.pbtech.co.nz/index.php?z=p p=VGAEVG2972 name=EVGA-GeForce-GTX970-4GB-ACX-Dual-Fan-PCI-E-3.0-Vid 




 May have the opportunity to pick one up on Tuesday. A local computer store is having a sale on 970's and its within my budget so I'm thinking of getting one. I play at 1080p so I just wanted to double check that I wont be affected by the 970 memory issues.  




 yep. And its actually a decent port.  




 I ended up torrenting it haha.  




 the torrent has leaked go try it out yourself.  




 Actually Carrie not be an intelligence officer again does kind of make sense after what happend at the end of season 4.  









 Not gonna happen for me. I'm addicted to trailers.  




 da faq. 2.5 years? so what does that mean for Quinn?  




 your not a pirate. Your just changing region. Everybody does it. lol.  




 I went to Netflix last night to watch the avengers but found out for some reason its gone and after a bit of searching I found out it left Netflix back in December. They really need to bring back expiration dates on the app itself so people know. I know we have great posters here who let us know what movies are available on VOD services each week but there needs to be something that lets us know when movies are leaving Netflix. 














 whats it like? its optimized well? 









 The OP deleted it as soon as it was announced he was ok he felt his title was mis leading once the news he was ok came out.  




 Honestly I think the podcast is better without him. I find he just yells out a bunch of random crap and I have no interest in any of his opinions but thats just me. I've also noticed that when Jesse is on TB seems to take the backseat a bit more and lets everyone else speak  but this week TB seemed to be quite happy without Jesse.  




 Yea of course.I don't care what people say I'm not gonna get rid of my Xbox one and Ps4.  














 So whats happening with the sequel? Do we know for sure that its in development? I remember reading that the sequel is expected in 2016 and that Aiden might not be the main protagonist.  









 I Amazing Spider-Man 2'd myed self. No regrets. The trailers saved me from going to the movie. so top kek to sony for that one.  









 Think for a moment about ghosts. There are two proposed types: intelligent ghosts, and memories. Then, there are time travelers, something that seems unrelated at first thought.

Intelligent ghosts are the type you can interact with, and can interact with you. Some consider them to be dangerous, and others think them friendly.

Memories, however, are like a recording, repeating over and over. Imagine hearing a childs laugh every night at 3am. It is always the same, and always plays at the same time.

A time traveler dropping into the past for ten seconds would be able to interact for that brief moment. To an observer, the traveler would be seen appearing from nowhere, doing an action, and disappearing. Could this be considered a ghost as well? 



















 By the time May comes around BvS will be less than 12 months out.Which is still quite early for a teaser. Trailers don't usually start releasing till about 6 months out. A few movies being the exception like Interstellar with a teaser trailer one year out.  




 This is still not enough to make me switch. I use windows as my daily driver for work so I cant really switch to Linux even if I wanted to. I wouldn't switch to it on my desktop or laptop at home ether.  




 I always assumed it was bitch? 









 MTV and Awards used in the same sentence. LMAO. what a joke.  














 Nek minute... 









 I thought I read some where that hes supposed to have a cameo along with Heimdall. yea here it is. http://au.ign.com/articles/2014/11/03/idris-elba-says-heimdall-and-loki-are-in-age-of-ultron-calls-going-from-mandela-to-thor-2-torture 









 I know that. I'm asking what is stark going to do with the scepter.  









 Wonder what this means for his Alien movie? Would contracts have been signed at this stage so the studio is obligated to let him make it or could they still cancel the project? 




 20% on rotten tomatoes, 5 reviews only 1 is positive. I know its still too early to call it but its not looking good.  




 This looks really good. Ian McKellen is gonna make a great Mr Holmes.  









 I remember reading some where about Zoe returning in a flash back or something. I guess it was just a bs rumor.  




 the star wars prequels. The internet forgets that there is an entire generation of people that actually like those movies and probably dont say anything when their favorite movies get hated on.  




 they had reshoots planned for January-Febuary so its not to far fetched to think they coud of used that time to put something together.  














 anyone got one last guess as to what they might announce? 




 hes on drugs. I mean look at his eyes he looks like hes 420 blazing it. 

http://media.comicbook.com/uploads1/2015/01/a-hulk-117758.jpg 




 I've only seen him in House of Cards. Any movies of his I should check out? 









 well if spider-man isn't in Civil War after this then something went seriously wrong. He should have more than a cameo if they are signing a deal with the directors of Civil War.  
























 "Make it better" he said lol  




 Since we know Ahsoka is alive. Where was she during revenge of the sith?  









 First couple of tv spots are already out.  









 That was a dick move on his part. He should of just done it and not drag it out, he basically tortured the poor girl. I guess they wanted to show how far Doug had fallen and how loyal he his to Frank. Still pissed me of though.  




 Not sure if its just me but games have a been pretty shit recently. just wondering what everyone is playing? 




 But I liked clones :( 




 that would be weird but a nice surprise none the less. Maybe strange uses some alternate dimension thing to bring spider-man into the MCU? 




 Its not official, but they have been right about stuff before. They called the marvel and sony spider-man deal months before it was announced.  














 When you realize you only have one episode left before you have to wait another year :( 









 Inception 









 RDJ is more likely to announce the new actor playing spider-man rather than the director of the new movie. Spider-Man will replace Iron Man as the face of the MCU come phase 4 it would only make sense that RDJ announce his replacement.  














 Paid sex is best sex.  



















 Take a break! seriously people take your 15 min break or however long you get! Get some fresh air or get something to eat. Do something just get out of that chair and put that headset down every chance you get otherwise you will go insane.  









 In Soviet Russia we be friend you.  




 Any news on when Wii U emulation might become a thing? 









 Totally agree! I fuckin loved whiplash. I would of been happy if ether American Sniper or Whiplash won over Birdman.  




 I thought American Sniper was a much better movie than Birdman. Birdman is just overly long, boring and tedious outside of Michael Keatons performance it just didnt do anything for me.  









 You guys are lucky. Back when I was younger. It took up to a year for a movie a movie to hit vhs and dvd. Now it only takes 3-4 months. For bluray and VOD. 









 Man remember when everyone thought this was for the halo movie? good times.  




 FYI. Its not my poster.  









 Thanks. I knew he slipped in the bath tub but I didn't see the lump on his arm. I was watching it pretty late so I guess  I didn't see it.  




 Since the first film took place in 2019. Would be a nice little nod to the first film.  




 Use Hola extension and change region to US.  




 Anyone care to explain this? I was a bit lost 









 Just wanted to double check here first, does the standard $7.99 sub include HD or is HD only included with the 2 screens + HD sub for $8.99?  









 Being in NZ we are a full day a head of America. So I have to wait till saturday.  the pain is real.  









 I'm a big gamer, I love all platforms but nintendo has never really done anything for me outside of Pokemon.So its weird that I've been considering picking up a Wii U but I'm not even sure why I want one. Are there any MUST have Wii U exclusives? I guess I do want to play Mario Kart 8 and theres always the off chance nintendo brings out a pokemon colosseum like game for the Wii U sometime in the future. But beyond that I just dont know really.  



















 Confirmation of Spidey in Civil War calling it now.  



















 Back when infinity war was announced their was a bit of debate whether or not infinity war was one movie just split into two or if it counted as avengers 3 and 4. Anyone know if we ever got an answer? 









 I was excited for the mods and to see what the pc community would bring to the table but Ive already played it on ps4 and now after this 3rd delay any I had for the pc version died with it. 





























 980ti isnt going to happen. Why would Nvidia undercut their flagship gpu with the Titan X? 




 Fuck off grammar natzi.  




 Why do you post links to dead subs? you think your funny but your not.  




 was cooper dead after he ejected from his craft? and everything after that was a dream? or was he alive and did he really save mankind? my problem the cooper being dead theory is what about dr brand? shes left to die on that alien planet? or would other humans eventually find her? 




 There would be no life left on earth.  









 No one cares if you pre order or not its your money.  









 sell body parts you don't need? 














 There should be. Such a stupid move on DC/WB part. Gustin so damn good as the flash.  


































 The whole sub switch thing. so stupid.  


































 When I was in Bali I saw a dude taking a piss on the side of the street. this cant be unseen. disgusting.  









 this will be the last break this season. After this break its a straight run to the season finale.  




 Instead of Barry revealing his identity to Iris like he did in the alternate timeline in present day he revealed it to Eddy. It seems like time is finding a way to fix what Barry altered. Also in the new promo once again we see Dr wells confronting Cisco but under different circumstances. Maybe this explains why Oliver is wearing league gear because time changed so much that it caused things to change like Oliver accepting the offer to become Ra's. 









 750ti is not potato tier. An r7 250 is potato tier. thats a decent rig there.  




 ps4 or Wii U 














 When I broke my Clavicle back in high school. fuck that was pain.  









 fuckin casual. why dont you have a robot? 









 whats your budget? 









 Furious 8: The Revenge of Helen Mirren 
























 LOL kdramasters, what a joke.  




 Still not worth it. Also the only reason EA dropped the price is cause so many people refunded the game.  



















 no they just haven't updated their website.  







































 Can you change my account password again please?  
































































 I knew that crossovers were now a yearly thing but yea kinda surprising.  





























 Despite It looking a lot smaller compared to the other MCU films its got a great cast and I think its gonna have a lot of heart in it. I think the audience will really get behind Ant-Man once they see the movie. Sure it might not be a box office hit like Captain America or Iron Man but I think it will do well enough that marvel and the overall fan base wont be disappointed. I know a lot of you don't share this opinion and that's fine but I felt like Ant-Man needed some loving around here seen to many negative threads about it recently.  









 your work blocks IGN but not Reddit. Sounds like you have a great network administrator. lol 




 LOL 



















 Anyone know? buddy of mine just picked up resident evil 4/5/6 for a dollar. Could they end up charging him the full price or remove the games from his library? 




 His spidey senses were tingling.  









 really? they are already introducing inhumans and that doesnt come out till 2019. Civil War comes out next year and its too early? lol.  




 The battle between old shield and new? Iron man will side with new shield while captain america sides with Coulsons shield? 




 Before being interrupted by Caitlin I got the feeling he was going to explain everything like he did in the previous ep just under different circumstances due to the rupture of the time barrier.  




 Last I heard it booted its first commercial game ocarina of time 3D have we heard anything since? 




 Would be neat if they mentioned him being on it and teased him on AOS like the week before the show premieres on Netflix. Have coulson mention a masked vigilante going around the streets of New York saving people.  




 We continue to get ripped off and complain when we have to pay for online multiplayer and complain about how shit our fps is. we're constantly getting poorly developed games especially this gen with the ps4 and xbox one. So why do we continue to support consoles? 














 You should keep the quadro as a memento of your time together.  














 So when Joss signed his three year deal with marvel he basically became not only in charge of the avengers for that time but also became a sort of show runner for the MCU helping out other films like Thor 2 and Guardians of the Galaxy when they needed a hand and basically pointed the MCU in the right direction. However now his time is almost up and I'm wondering who will take his place? The Russo Brothers seem like the logical choice at this point but on the side they have the ghost busters to worry about and it would seem like its too much for even two people to worry about. if not the Russo brothers who would you choose to take Whedon's place? 



















 waiting for the inevitable "GTA V delayed to may 14" announcement 














 They should of kept the scene with Peters dad returning it would of wrapped up the story a bit more.  




 Le snacks 




 I get more Karma.  



















 Ikr plus I have another resit I can use if I fail anyway lol.  









 How did you know? (   )  









 Is it really that hard to get a debit card? they are so convenient how can you not have one? 



















 Tokyo 



















 "being drunk" good one :) 




 yea what the hell. Stupid move on their part.  



















  I'm finding it harder and harder to justify having a Netflix account anymore when its so much easier to just torrent stuff that doesn't expire.  




 she wasn't using it just dropped out of her pocket.  




 Yea also I heard the hobbit and the Lord of the rings will be available as well.  




 https://www.facebook.com/NetflixANZ/photos/a.924685260898686.1073741828.833905236643356/935046583195887/?type=1 theater

Maybe the New Zealand version wont be so bad after all.  




 Does she think hes too dangerous and unpredictable? If that's the reason she could just as easily put some device inside his head like a kill switch if he ever got out of control. Anyone reckon we might see Slade eventually part of the suicide squad on arrow? 














 So I've been playing basically since release and the game is great but I seem to be getting a point now where Ill start a city, get to the half way point and then just loose motivation to go any further and actually finish the city. I'm not sure why though. Anyone else feeling the same? 









 Doubt it. If hes leading a team of new avengers. Hell most likely appear at least in infinity war part 1 where may die and Bucky will take his place as Captain America.  




 Why are reports saying he wont make it out of Age of Ultron? is it just mis direction? 














 Goosebumps.  









 Allie's Bread 




 Dude I've been doing this since primary school. Vegemite and Potato chips ftw!  









 Hmm ok. well what do you think would be best? a new fan or a hotswap bay? 




 Heres a few pics of my case. The fan you see near the hard drive doesn't work anymore it hasn't been working for a while but I didn't think it was an issue until I saw my hard drive temps. I have no idea how to remove it because the way the case is designed. Hence why I just want to put a fan underneath the hard drive itself. sorry for the quality of the pics btw I used my ps vita lol. http://imgur.com/a/WaQ1m 




 So I need to put a 80mm fan underneath my hard drive. My hard drive temps arent ideal. I've seen it as high as 55c while gaming. Slight problem though. I have no where to mount it. would it be ok if I just slid it under the hard drive bay so the fan is blowing air upwards? it would not be screwed into the mother board or anything though it would be loose under the hard drive bay because I have no where to mount it.Would this be ok? 









 March is slowly coming to an end and the rumors last year indicated that Destiny would launch on PC sometime this month. Anyone heard anything? 
























 I actually laughed out loud. What is that accent? Italian? 




 because the steam machine also uses AMD. so he wanted to make it as close as possible.  




 its monthly updates once the final release is out not while its in technical preview.  




 LOL it does not have a keylogger what a load of bullshit.  





























 your joking right? 









 Bored.  




 Open Office 



















 I'm starting to think that maybe there's something to those downgrade rumors. No DX12 support are you fucking serious?  














 Wheres my KARMA Bitch! 



















 Anyone else agree? 




 who else thought the Anaglyph 3D movies were really cool back in the day? I'm talking about Spykids 3D and Sharkboy and lava girl. Call me old fashioned and this maybe the nostalgia talking but I think the Anaglyph 3D is better than the Real3D. 




 If you did not tear up while watching this then you have no soul! 




 Personally I've never been interested into the Dark/Demon Souls type games and from the trailers BloodBorne doesn't do much for me ether. So tell me why should I be excited for this game? 









 I understand the episode basically retconned itself at the end, obviously some effects of barry time traveling will play into next episiode but I'm still a bit confused on if this is a glimpse into the future or just a possible out come due to barry messing with time.  
























 So what do you guys think, should there be jedi in the game? 









 No way I'm watching them to make sure theirs no Jar Jar. If I even see a hint of Jar Jar I'm not watching.  




 They probably got the special confused with S4. S4 will film later this year once Benedict has filmed Doctor Strange which starts filming May. 




 Sherlocks probably high on drugs. Watson walks in and finds him stoned out of his mind mumbling a bunch of random words ends up telling some random story in Victorian London. Watson proably bitch slaps sherlock at the end to wake up him.  









 And even then their "bad ones" are still above average and rather enjoyable films. I.E Thor 2, First Avenger etc 




 $800 for a 680 which is now 2 generations old. It should be a lot cheaper than that.  




 As far as I know. And who says Nvidia will even release a 980ti this gen? why would they when the Titan X is their new flagship card.  




 Nice typo Mabel. 





























 Never been to one before but seriously considering it for the premium experience especially for a movie of this caliber. Is paying extra for gold class worth it over your average walk in cinema? 




 HOLY DAMN MY EYES! 




 Sounds your like your psu is dying and gta 5 is pushing it to the limit.  














 im gonna pre order it just to piss you off.  




 It will be on Origin.  Not steam.  




 And of course people still bitch about batmans voice. their never gonna get it right enough to please enough people. I thought it was bad ass. I hope they go through with it.  









 mine will. i7, 8gb ram, gtx 970. I'm ready for this game.  









 who cares! buy! 




 Star Wars and Batman V Superman. I'm in total geek mode right now! hype! 




 what about the people who got tickets to the imax event? kinda sucks for them . 




 works for me.  




 new link! http://www.comicbookmovie.com/fansites/JoshWildingNewsAndReviews/news/?a=118811 




 Gone. These are dropping like flies lol.  




 and yours is gone too lol. 




 And its gone. Sorry peeps.  














 he doesn't get any say in whether or not they crossover. if marvel and kevin feige want it to happen it will happen with or without him.  




 amd cpus naturally run hot. 77C is nothing to worry about imo. when it gets 80c or above then worry.  




 crikey thats 2am my time. oh well. sleep is for the weak! 









 **** I hate reviewers like these. They try to be different for the sake of being different but don't express their own actual opinion.  




 the new force awakens trailer and star wars battle front trailer will premiere at star wars celebration.  




 Too late hes Doctor Strange and hes going to be awesome.  




 why? as long as Tom Cruise is physically able to play the role of Ethan Hunt keep making the moies.  









 Yea not right now but down the line mainly due to the fact that Miles doesn't exist until peter parker dies. so theres that.  




 So Is 3d bluray still a thing, and do people use it? if so whats it like? Also whats the current adoption rate of 4k tvs? have you guys moved to 4k yet or are you sticking with 1080p tvs? 




 Disagree. I still enjoy arrow but Flash has been vastly superior to arrow this season.  









 Could be a bad overclock. Did you overclock at all recently? 



















 Seems to be missing some movies.  









 War machine.  









 Reminds of  me of what happened with Patty Jenkins and Thor 2.  









 Hey ive got the same laptop. Asus laptops are great.  



















 Loud music at 6am.  














 Initially chose the wrong career path, ended up with 20k extra student loan debt that I didn't need. Now on the right path but I still regret that decision. wasted 2 years of my life. sucks man. I often wonder tho had I not made that first mistake would I have gotten to where I am now? maybe, maybe not who knows.  









 Loki in The Avengers. Hes got the joker elements but hes less serious I guess? not sure if thats the right way to describe him.  




 you sure its the thermal paste and that your cooler is mounted properly? 




 AMC indie spotlight.  




 Never. The animated movies are still really successful in their own right. 



















 you probably have a virus or bit coin miner that found its way on to your machine.  









 Don't get me wrong the MCU has had some cool villains not great but cool. Loki was fun and entertaining to watch kinda reminds me of the joker a bit. Bucky was awesome too. But Fisk is just on anothr level entirely. Every time he was on screen I was legitmately scared for our heroes whic has never happened in the main MCU films because we know our hero will survive because hes got another movie out the following year. Now I really want Fisk to shows up in the new spider-man movie that would be amazing.  




 Spider-Man as a meta for the audiences would be kinda cool.  




 A little more context please.  




 yep episode 4 is out now lmao.  









 because reviewers need to write their reviews in advance.  




 I haven't seen anything yet to indicate they have and with all the age of ultron press the cast need to do not sure how they will find time.  




 Civil War begins filming next month not Doctor Strange.  




 The Russo Brothers  




 Be pretty funny if it ended up being Doctor Strange.  



















 You know I think I saw that in a tv show.  




 I'm telling you man good manners get you far lol.  




 HP and the order of the phoenix. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgXoH6NrnOc 





























 I couldn't believe he was that stupid when I read that part but it turns out he is. I'm just baffled.  




 I know. His last comment especially just infuriated me. He admits to being a PC gamer but then calls us bastards? wtf.  














 Ill miss the 20th century fox logo :( 




 Really? Id called that innovation but that's just me. 




 you cant brnig the guy back if he dosn't want to. These movies are exhausting to make.  




 I hope its true. The piledriver architecture that AMD has been using since 2012-13 is old and out of date and AMD fans have been wanting a high end APU for some time now. Hopefully they don't screw it up like the bulldozer chips.  




 The july date was given to spider-man since hes now part of the MCU.  









 Didn't catch on? explain why it made over 2 billion dollars then? I think people liked it for what it was not because it was trying to be a poor mans star wars.  




 he did say in the OP there is certain things he cant talk about so Thanos is probably one of them.
 




 Almost forgot how was Andy Serkis in the movie?  




 Ooh now I'm really curious.  




 Game of thrones and Daredevil in the same weekend. Hype.  




 In what way was it disappointing? did it not directly tease the next movie? 




 were you guys asked to lie or deny certain things about the movie? 




 Interesting. So I shouldn't believe everything I read on twitter then? since I saw someone say hes not in it.  




 Can you confirm if Loki or Heimdall appear in the movie? 




 Had to google this cause I never heard that Joss was actually pissed about it but it seems like he actually is from what I read which sucks because I think Idris was just excited and accidentally let it out I don't think he purposefully did it just for attention like some articles make out he did. If he is cut from AOU because of this I'm glad Joss isn't doing Infinity War he seems like a bit of a dick imo but im sure there's more to this than we publicly know.  




 you sure? it looks like the suit he was wearing at the end of winter soldier that he got from the museum.  




 Why did Dom just get up and awkwardly leave, and also where was he going and why didn't Letty go with him? I thought they were married? 




 I like how cap is wearing the old suit.  




 Bullshit it felt like a rushed movie it was almost 3 hours long lol.  




 Loki according to this guy. So did Idris lie about having a scene with Tom? or was it cut?

https://twitter.com/reed_tucker/status/586353360737021952 




 Someones getting angry sex tonight.  




 giving presentations or anything that involves public speaking. fuck that shit. let some other schmuck do it.  









 Punch myself in the face 














 So Its ok to talk about GTA 5 but not COD? since when did you make the rules? 









 Punny.  




 tbh I wouldn't mind if that was the case. Disney has so much on their plate right now its insane. I want this movie to get as much development time as possible before going into production. 




 maybe rockstar shouldn't of taken so long in the first place. The reason alot of people will pirate gta 5 is cause they dont trust rockstar to make a decent port after what happened with gta4. its hard to care about rockstar in this situation.  









 Link? cant seem to find it.  




 I remember reading that Scott Derrickson was supposed to direct with CBS films financing the project. Anyone know what happened?  




 I agree with AD,Elementary,TG. Haven't tried Mad Men yet. Modern Family is not my thing but The Newsroom and Doctor Who are amazing.  




 Agree with this one. I tried watching the piot. I couldn't even finish it, it was that bad.  




  I was like this at first. Took me a few tries to get into it but once I did it was awesome.  



















 wait the video description says 13 episodes? I thought it was 10? 




 I'm actually curious to know more lol.  














 the camera makes it more cinematic.  














 How do you think theyll do it? Could it be as small as Hawkeyes cameo in Thor? 









 Original Post http://www.gpforums.co.nz/threads/498518-Are-all-mac-users-numpties?p=10533958#post10533958

Ill dig up a story I still cant get over even years on

At my old repair shop job, we had a 27" iMac come in that the user said the DVD Drive stopped working, and it was out of warranty\user didint buy applecare so apple would not touch it

Some poking about later we ended up pulling a shitload of toast and crumbs out of the slotloader, we even tipped it up and shook it and such a large amount of crumbs came out after the chunks of toast we physically fished out left us stupefied, we instantly assumed the user had kids and the kids did kid things with the mac, and as a result the drive was toast (heh)

we told the user and he went all red and said "well, I uhh.. thought it was hungry"

"huh?"

"Yeah! Well recently its always been a bit slow when you turn it on in the mornings, like its tired or something, and I figured that I feel like crap until Ive had breakfast in the morning, and I have my breakfast at the computer desk so I thought it just needed a bit more energy, so I fed it toast!"


uwotm8


Mac users eh lol.  














 At the start of this episode John was trying to train Finch to use a gun of sorts, preparing him for when John is gone. Anyone else think they might of been foreshadowing his death? 




 bullshit. if you do it properly you should only have to do it once in a life time.  




 At least you have a job.  




 That's already out.  




 Dr strange is next year.  




 Damn it you stole my answer! lol.  









 Seen the movie a couple of times now and I'm eager for the bluray release. Any ideas when? 









 End of this week. The press screenings are on the 9th. 














 Anyone know if arrow will get a wondercon trailer? 









 Yes! Even though I play it on PC. Hearthstone is one of those games that should go multiplatform. I mean it kind of has already with the iphone and android. But Im surprised those happened before the console versions. Hopefully Blizzard gets around to it.  




 Thats a bad way to do it in my opinion. your basically starving yourself the rest of the day. id call that an unbalanced diet.  









 wait campaign? da faq? 









 make sure its signed in contract as well that way you can sue them if you ever have a bad day lol 









 Barry attacking Eddie is at 1:07 in the wondercon trailer. At least I think its Eddie it looks like him.  









 In the wondercon trailer we see Barry punching the shit out of Eddie. My theory is that Eobard Thawne decides to leave Dr wells body after realizing that Barry is close to finding out the truth he takes over Eddies body essentially killing him (like he did with the real Dr Wells) that's why we see Eddie killing those cops in the wonder con trailer.  









 Revenge of the sith, Quantum of Solace.  




 I lost the game! 














 6300 is a decent cpu 4300 should be avoided at all costs . 




 But the human eye cant tell the difference between a 7790 and a gtx 970.  




 This one.  




 Justin Lin is directing star trek 3.  




 Link doesn't seem to be working just getting a blank page.  









 is the money in your own account? if so then legally you can access when ever you want.  




 keep it! not sure how you just find a mobo with an i7 on it lol but kudos to you haha.  




 its trademe what do you expect.  




 But if he doesn't get a break till December that means season 4 wont be ready at all by the fall this year? 




 I've been thinking with Amell now cast in TMNT2 It'll be interesting to see how they will find time to film arrow. I mean unless Season 4 features very little of Oliver I cant see when they would film it if they still want season 4 to premiere in the fall this year. TMNT2 will be filming for at least 5 or 6 months that's not including the possibility of reshoots ether and Casey Jones is an important character in the TMNT story so its not like they can film less to accommodate Amell filming arrow other wise the story would suffer. I'm wondering if the addition of this new spin off show that features some characters from arrow is a way for the CW to fill the gap so at least the CW will have an alternative to Arrow if Arrow does need to take a break this year. Thoughts?
 




 Unfortunately it will. I'm not sure by how much though.  




 Too slow mate.  




 Like how many times did Toretto and Shaw ram their cars into each other for no reason? lol.  




 why does the carpet look like magets?  




 No its not.  




 Ryse son of rome is a fun pretty game if you like lots of quick time events and a cheesy michael bay esque story line . 




 is it batman arkham knight? what else is coming out?  




 So what was the deal with that? was that a subtle hint from the film makers that lucas black will have a larger roler in furious 8? Why didn't Sean go back to LA with Dom? maybe they just felt it wasn't right for this movie?  




 Monday to Friday its 10pm then awake at 4:15am. Weekends or holidays its when ever I feel like it . 









 Have you read the comics at all? if you haven't read the comics then X-men 3 is actually a pretty decent flick.  




 My recent obsession is Interstellar. Seen it about 5 times now. And when ever I'm doing something on my computer I always have Hans Zimmer's score in the background. Its just so damn good.  




 Excellent choice! 














 grammar natzi irl eh.  



















 http://i.imgur.com/CzgukMH.gif 
























 He was probably teasing his civil war involvement. which is now official.  




 That will change with direct x 12 though. http://wccftech.com/geforce-radeon-gpus-utilizing-mantle-directx-12-level-api-combine-video-memory/ 




 During the party scene Wilson mentions a missing persons case to cap. Anyone know what he was on about?  




 And this was mostly doing side missions to level up. The side missions are just as entertaining as the main story and a lot of the side missions link up with the main story line. Now I'm level 10 and I'm about to resume the main story line. This game is amazing. Its gonna keep me busy for months! 














 i watched it in 2 days.  




 I actually agree with them. I thought the VFX this season were really good.  




 Works for me here in NZ.  




 yea and I can get on the store just fine.  




 eh steam isn't down.  














 Get the 4gb model. Now a days games are using more vram than 2gb.  














 So let me see if I understand this correctly. Becuase of the alternate timeline and what not that the flash going missing happens a lot earlier than 2024? I'm guessing the black whole was the crisis also?  




 970 here. Played for 4 hours straight no problems.  









 You can run the witcher 3 just not on ultra or high settings.  














 I'm getting it on PC.  




 The wait is so painful especially when people on twitch are already playing it.  




 No begging.  




 I have this one to! its awesome.  









 here's the original interview if anyone's interested its around 3:10 when ruffalo appears. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0grQvejhFtU 




 its regional pricing. Everything is devalued over in the ukraine no idea why.  




 fyi this infographic is a bit out of date. Doctor Strange is out in November not July.  




 fyi I think this infographic is a bit out of date. Doctor Strange is coming out in November not July.  




 they moved it forward back in October when they announced phase 3. James Gunn announced the new date.  









 They will make it. Just not now. Probably in phase 4.  



















 Kayran from the witcher 2. such an awesome and challenging fight it was.  









 proably high settings at 1080p.  




 it will run it fine. Its just bullshit marketing. Nvidia trying to sell their 900 series cards.  









 I think present day Barry is gonna get stuck in the future and the whole flash vanishes in crisis will happen earlier than 2024 because of wells speeding things up. 




 Starling city is under attack and Barry be like. Nah I need to have a chat with my buddy wells.  









 Is Stephen Amell done with arrow? The way it ended it would seem like it. Or are they just sending Oliver away so that Amell can film TMNT2 and then return when hes done? 









 So Oliver appeared as the arrow on the new episode of the flash.He's seen wearing league gear. Anyone got an explanation to this and where it fits into the timeline? 









 Yea I know deadline and various other sites are saying its gotten a 13 episode renewal so I was curious and checked the official facebook and twitter pages of POI and I see they haven't announced on ether of those services that the show has been renewed yet. Is it possible their still deciding on the whole 13 episode thing? since deadline was the only one mentioning it maybe they jumped the gun a bit to soon and had an unreliable source? you'd think like other shows they would want their fans to know they have been renewed.  




 there is still one episode left.  




 Did that reference confirm GL is gonna appear eventually in the Flarrowverse? 




 Netflix
Hulu
Amazon (Prime)
TNT
Starz
ABC

Any others you guys think would suit POI?
 




 I could see amazon picking it up. they seem to have a good relationship with WB with amazon prime and all.  




 I find it interesting how Brett Dalton (Ward) seems to be back in the main cast.  




 We have two episodes tonight so we could find out then.  









 How can this Sub evolve if its not allowed to change? 




 and in one of the marvel one shots they reference blonsky and in agents of shield the abomination gets name droped.  














 Say for instance I get off my horse and go exploring for a bit come back after a while. Can my horse be attacked by other creatures and even die? 




 The Witcher 3 obviously.  




 I love it. very different from the american trailer.  









 interesting. mine shows 3.92gb http://imgur.com/2oFz5KI 




 Doesn't happen to me. weird. I got it on steam.  




 the best part lol "do NOT contact me with unsolicited services or offers" 




 OMG THIS. My mum does this all he time and she doesn't undestand why I get pissed off. its so damn annoying. Ill be like shut the door please after shes talks to me and shell just walk away. lol.  




 Red Skull anyone? 




 why do all of his movies suck so bad? 









 Action movies. I have no shame. I liked transformers 4 lol.  









 You have to remember they are marketing to a completely different audience in Japan. what seems like a spoiler or ruined moment to us probably doesn't to them. Its a very different and tough audience to market to.  









 Anyone else get the feeling their up to something? Especially Agent Weaver I get an evil vibe from her when ever she gets involved in discussions and mission plannings its like shes hiding something and shes got her own motives for doing things.  




 LOL thats bullshit.  




 Damn and no word on Fox shopping the show around to netflix or hulu :( 




 The blacklist already got renewed for season 3.  




 Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooo! 




 Not at all. Chris Evans was the human torch and Captain America. Why can't Hardy be The Punisher and a DC character?  









 How do you think season 9 will open and where do you think everyone will end up?

I think Leonard and Penny will get married

Raj will continue dating Emily despite being weirded out by her

Howard and Bernadette will ether kick Stuart out within the first few episodes or something will happen to Stuart that forces them to let him stay with them. 

Not to sure about Sheldon. He might try and get Amy back but the way they ended the episode it seems pretty clear the relationship is over at least for now. Really looking forward to see how the writers handle this. 
 




 wooo 3 hour podcast hype.  









 lets say he is Spider-Man and the whole "casting a younger actor" was just a ruse, do you think he'd be a good choice?.  




 Finally he gets in on the action and he now knows whats really been bothering Felicity! This was long overdue she should of told him about the league like 3 or 4 episodes ago.
 




 I don't care what people say Im watching them in the order their aired.  




 As soon I saw how Oliver reacted when he heard that maseo gave ra's the bioweapon I knew he wasn't brainwashed.  




 why the heck would I skip an episode of the flash? gtfo.  




 Not gonna happen.  




 No one is hating on it. its just age of ultron didn't live up to the hype for a lot of us. its still a good movie but a lot of us feel underwhelmed by it.  




 Everyone has their own opinion. But I liked the movie alot. I personally think Norton is a better Bruce than Ruffalo. You should still watch it, it has a lot of great moments.  









 Why did you get a 5930k instead of a 4790k? you could saved money and got a better gpu.  




 Mean while Civil War will actually be the big kahuna that we're all waiting for and marvel decided that age of ultron along with ant-man were just a bridge to fill the gap while we wait. It was almost like a filler episode of a tv show setting up and teasing whats to come and didn't really move the plot forward aside from meeting some new characters. Maybe this was intentional or I just picked up on it due to Whedons background work on TV? It just felt like an episode of a tv show that plays before the finale you know what I mean? 









 I like the story to. Multplayer not so much. Mainly because I just don't have the time to invest in it.  




 I think the very concept of supergirl sounds stupid and just doesn't fit in the arrow and flash universe imo.  




 This is old news.  




 War machine is absent quite a bit in phase 2 we see him a bit in Iron Man 3 then all of a sudden he is a member of the new avengers? I guess we're to assume that a lot of stuff happened off screen between him and cap but id sort of like an explanation of what happened I mean sure he helped out in Ultron but does that make him worthy to be a member of the avengers? I guess maybe stark recommended him to cap as his replacement? 









 well he is a new avenger. so not surprising. would be kinda weird not to see him. 














 benchmarks or I don't believe you.  














 Well I saw someone mention it over on r/pcmasterrace that their was someone or a group of people working to bring the campaign to halo online.  









 Also looks like its gone up a couple of percent, before it was at 73% and I was worried it might drop below 70% hopefully it can work its way back up to at least 80%. 

http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/avengers_age_of_ultron/ 









 What a movie indeed. so glad I finally I saw it. Colin Firth was a bad ass. Action scenes were really well done to. So happy to hear its getting a sequel it really is a sleeper hit. More people need to see this one.  




 Any thoughts as to why hes teaming up with Barry? if hes supposedly forgotten everything about Oliver it doesn't make sense unless Barry manages to get through to Oliver some how but Oliver keeps pretending hes brain washed when he really isn't just to buy time and figure out a plan.  




 yea its fair. i liked the first movie and loved guardians and cap 2. I found the first half of ultron a bit boring and tedious to get through.I didn't start appreciating the twins till the second half of the film. It definitely shows that Whedon is running out of ideas and its probably a good thing hes not doing infinity war. id say its fair. Ill be a bit worried if it keeps dropping though.  




 its sad that you have to point this out. people are so afraid to speak their opinion.  




 it was avengers assemble in most countries outside of the U.S.  




 Heres some of my ideas

Have an original avenger die. e.g stark or cap

Spider-Man swings in making his first appearance in an avengers movie. 

Have the avengers actually do some serious damage to thanos, thanos withdraws but we see a credit scene with him and his real army of villains and what ever aliens he might have at his disposal, ready to return in part 2. 

The guardians arrive to save the day. 

Got any other cool ideas? 

 




 Wow....  














 people hate on 2 and 3 but I like both I thought 4 was trash.  




 Since steam has pretty much gone to shit. Gog galaxy will be the next big thing, right? 









 power supply could be on its way out, maybe its not delivering enough power. it happens.  




 Not everyone wants to build their own.  




 you can https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KubRDApPHc 




 You know their gonna use that in their arguments now.  




 its a new zealand based store. its fully legit.  




 Or do I need to get an actual 3d monitor? 



















 no.  




 no. buying online is much more convenient as long as you get it from a good store like new egg or amazon.  




 and yet OP will be at the star wars episode 7 opening night.  




 i agree with this but what we can agree on is that the joker looks terrible. But his performance might be awesome. And that's what matters. 









 fake. 
























 RDJ has two more movies on his contract. Civil War and Infinity War Part 1. He will probably die in Infinity War.  









 I like it. it ties everything together.  




 I think at some point in the upcoming crossover with the flash, Barry is going to tell Oliver that he can travel back in time. I think Barry and Oliver will some how travel back in time and save Sara thus preventing any of this from happening and Oliver never has to join the league.  









 It was mostly small bits of the title music for spider-man 2 that I noticed quietly remixed in a couple of the action sequences involving Wanda Maximoff sounded very Danny Elfman esque.  




 i thought it was pretty weak. i haven't seen the movie yet but it just felt bit disappointing. I would of been happy if the spidey one was real.  




 Type cast? hes only been in guardians and now in Jurassic world. That is not being type cast.  









 broadwell cpu. Nice. 960m is also pretty solid. decent for 1080p gameplay.  




 I don't know why your being downvoted this would be the best option if something like this were to happen 




 They were standing in a police station i dont see how wells would of gotten away with it.  





























 By doing what ever the f I want  









 some of its ok if the chick sems to enjoy it but I've seen it to point where it sounds like their in pain and im just yea im done lol.  




 I actually don't mind this. lol.  









 I tried the code and it doesn't work.  














 I went to buy it from nuveem but its still not available there. Any other places that have the price as low as nuveem did?

 before I forget , credit to the original post http://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/336yil/what_is_this_a_billboard_for_ants/ 




 Don't all marvel movies use the stero d logo? 




 it will be this year guardians of the galaxy I'm calling it now :) 









 they could be lying remember they said their was gonna be no post credit scene for the first one and then bam we get the Shawarma scene.  














 its not aborted. its still in the pipeline its just being reworked to accomodate the new spiderman.  




 the iron man reboot is quite interesting. its good to know they have a plan when RDJ eventually leaves.  




 god damn i love these emails. hilarious.  




 https://wikileaks.org/sony/emails/emailid/88763 




 If he wanted to watch any of the prequels he could probably get away with just watching revenge of the sith it has enough back story for anakin imo.  




 Its apparently from the hacked sony emails. so it could be legit.  




 There are too many story lines and we need to choose which ones we are focusing on and lift out the other ones, ie; could reduce father arc to just Roosevelt?
 
Could cut out plane crash and Richard destroying spiders and start on armored car  dont start with Spider-Man.let the danger/stakes to NYC build first and then have Spider-Man enter the scene heroically.
 
Tone down Paul Giamatti performance, so he seems a bit more menacing and less cartoonish.
 
If you cut Richard from the opening and the plane crash maybe you could instead do Harry coming home and seeing Norman at the top of the movie as a cold open.
 
Really love Electro  feels like you may not need the scene in his apartment, which makes him seems completely crazy and hard to relate too.
 
Like the idea that eel goes in his mouth and instead of burrowing, you see it glow within him
 
Need to set up the Power Plant earlier, visually.
 
Seems like the movie switches povs a lotwhy are we in Maxs pov during the car chase, worth looking at this playing out from Spideys pov.
 
There could be a better way to reveal that Peter is missing graduation  maybe when you cut Gwen you cut to the wide shot? 
 
Tiny note  dont think Peter would lie to Gwen about sirens --- maybe he just downplays it
 
Stan Lee Cameo  maybe need a little more emphasis on Peter here trying to get out of his costume and not be in seenset up a little more the pressure of the principal getting closer and closer to calling his name.
 
Instead of seeing the ghost of Captain Stacy, can just here the voice in Peters head and maybe flash back to the last movie?  Dont think we should add Cap Stacy back into car chase.
 
There is too much back and forth with Peter and Gwen  can we recut the Dim Sum scene so that it doesnt feel so repetitive of their break-up in the last movie  Can Peter be more honorable and definitive and less wishy-washy?
 
Why do we need a year to pass
 
Harry story feels like the main plot of the movie  Peter should look into the past b/c of Harry  maybe find some photos of them together as kidsuse obsession wall more to set up this part of his past not just what happened to parents.
 
Not sure what Peter learns at Roosevelt is entirely correct. Were distracted by the idea that Peter became Spider-Man b/c of his fathers blood --- all this special back story with his super-scientist dad fights with the idea that Peter is normal kid from Queens who becomes the greatest super-hero in the world
 
Andrews performance is all over the placea lot of crying and then a lot of mania. Hard to track him emotionally sometimes. It undermines his reaction to Gwens death b/c he gets upset and emotional a lot.
 
Dont like the idea that May tells Peter his parents were spies b/c two seconds later he finds out they are not and it again fights with the idea that hes an ordinary kid.
 
Like the idea that May finds out hes Spider-Man  finds his costume instead of just the rosemary harris wink-wink all the time.
 
Kind of like the morgue, but hate the dancing mortician  clich.
 
Are you using VFX to show how Electro is travelling from one point to another (bursts of electricity).
 
Need to underscore capture of goblinmore sirens as you linger on the clock 1;21, 1:22 am (nice touch).
 
Surveillance scene should be about following Harry not Peterno one should be following Peter.
 
Can Electro hum Itsy-Bitsy Spider before he plays it electronicallymaybe we can use this again.
 
Maybe intercut the ending montage and hearing Gwens speech with someone going into special projects and revealing more easter eggs and see that the rhino case has been broke into and the suit is missinggreat way to transition to rhino ending.
 
Dont need Aunt May in the kitchen.
 
Spider-man needs to feel more directly responsible for preventing the planes from crashing.
 
Dont show New Yorkers looting. 




 I felt like they just released this teaser because they needed to before people forgot about the movie it didn't interest me at all except for the cool dialog from batman at the end. Maybe I was all hyped out from star wars. Hopefully the second trailer is better.  




 All of them. Find which suits your tastes better and stick with that.  




 They already have announced a spin off movie. its called rogue one.  









 Transcendence is so bad tho. I usually like Depp but his performance was so bland.  




 i hated 2 but like 3 and 4 and 1.  




 The Star Wars prequels. I grew up with these and love them. You guys had the OTT and I had the prequels and you cant take that away.  









 i think skyrims even gone cheaper than that for like $3 or something.  









 it was available in 3D in countries outside the U.S. 









 I am and I cant fucking wait! 




 Space battles will probably come later with DLC. I guarantee it. Don't tell me DICE don't have something like that planned in the future.  





























 I'm guessing its an extended cameo then.  














 why not get the arkham knight bundle? 




 Doesnt really answer the question though. the texture pop in is what made it unplayable for me.  









 Is this subreddit gonna do a season 8 re-watch before season 9 premieres? 









 Book 6....Keep dreaming.  




 No. I hate this game with a passion.  




 That are not part of their main phases sort of like star wars anthology movies? 




 if your not going to watch it all dont bother. Every episode is essential to the plot. If you skip one you'll miss something important and it just wont make sense. 




 i think OP is talking about the movie Max with the dog.  









 yea but marvel seems to want people to think that the incredible hulk never happened :( 









 that tweet sounded like the person wasn't a marvel fan tho and just mocked the name ant-man.  




 I mean what other villains besides Loki have returned for more than one movie in the MCU? I really want YellowJacket to survive Ant-Man. Been a bit annoyed that Red Skull hasn't made a come back yet.  









 All of us need to see this movie to show marvel we want more new characters.  Marvel will be watching this one closely to see how it performs.  









 english version ftw.  




 Or will they just go **** it and keep moving forward? 




 Geek0id 3 cause you ain't geek0id.  









 stupid article is stupid. what major update? did I miss something? 




 Stop making shit up.  














 A lot of people are expecting it flop or fall below expectations. I think when a movie, especially one like ant-man defies all expectations id consider it a sleeper hit.  




 There are some streaming websites in countries like korea that get exclusive streaming rights a month or so after the cinema release state side. People then use a piece of software to rip the video from their servers.  




 What when? 




 Hank Pym should task Scott Lang to steal one of Stark's Iron Man helmets as a test but Scott ends up doing it for shits and giggles and he ends up on the avengers radar when Jarvis captures him on a security camera and all you see is an iron man helmet on starks work bench suddenly move and fall of the table and seemingly walk out the door on its own and starks just staring at the screen with a stunned reaction. 




 LOL imagine ant-man stealing Iron Mans helmet or something just for shits and giggles.  




 Doesn't make it official unless it comes directly from Marvel.  




 you must be real fun at parties.  




 yea they reported that the amazing spider-man 3 was going to go into production turned out to be bs.  




 I know its winter but is something else going on in the environment? Its not usually this cold is it? I could barely feel my hands this morning.  









 I really want to know what happened between the first avenger and winter soldier.  




 I always support the underdog and we need AMD to stick around   




 Anyone who wanted to play the master chief collection has already bought an xbox one. 

The ending of halo 4 would probably convince quite a lot of PC players to buy halo 5 and an xbox one. As a result MCC on PC would drive more sales for halo 5 and xbox one. This is something ms could use to their marketing advantage like. "play halo 4 on PC before halo 5 on xbox one with the master chief collection on pc in 1080p/60fps" idk im not a marketing guy lol just an idea. 

in the end just put the game on steam. Give it a bit of discount for having pc gamers wait so long and watch the money flow in. Everybody wins. 

 














 Amazon has showed interest in show in the past so tweet them as well.  









 You think thats bad? I live in New Zealand and Liriks streams start at around 4am and I get up at 4:30am. And they usually finish when I get home around mid day. So I hardly ever get to watch live except weekends.  




 its already aired and its been more than a few weeks since the finale. Id say its fair game.  




 yea they had to cancel their suicide squad plans with Harley Quinn once the movie was announced.  









 it said play it first on playstation. They didn't say it was exclusive. Play it first usually means its a timed exclusive.  




 The russo brothers are directing both so it doesn't matter.  









 the beauty of plot armor.  




 They know their audience 




 that would be pretty awesome.  




 we also need gears of war 2 and 3.  




 Man your an idiot.  




 Honestly I wouldn't care. They have to make money back somehow and if its through xbox live on PC ill take it. I just want halo on PC.  




 I call bullshit. If we have learned anything about the production leading up to this movie its that the studio hates leaks and spoilers. Other newsoutlets are also probably mad they didn't get this scoop so their trying to make people think its fake and are working with Disney to disprove this.  









 Thor: Ragnarok when it was announced Feige compared it to the winter solder in phase 2. Ragnarok will be the big game change in phase 3.  
























 Daniel Craig has one movie left after Spectre and it looks like casting could already be underway for his replacement. Lots of rumors over the last 24 hours include Damian Lewis as the potential new bond. Who do you think should take his place? 









 maybe hes a pro cod player and has to have the platform that gets the DLC first? 









 But you would'nt steal a car? 









 Thats true. Something like a 750ti will do you nicely. its small and uses hardly any power. Yet it has more graphics power than the ps4 and xbox one.  




 get a better graphics card and you'll be sweet.  




 well fallout 4 has been in development since fallout 3 came out. so its further along than Doom.  




 As will Tomb Raider and Battlefront. Battlefront cant get delayed cause Disney wants it out the same time as the force awakens and Tomb Raider has a licensing deal that will expire so MS will want take advantage of it.  




 Can we just stop and think about this for a minute. This movie made more money in one WEEKEND than some movies do in their LIFETIME. HOLY SHIT.  




 The First Avenger was alright. The only thing I didn't like were the scenes where cap had to get all patriotic and suck up to his superiors so he could be in the army. 




 Who else is taking the day off just to watch the show live? 




 I remember reading an article from Forbes where they said that agents of shield being renewed for season 3 pretty much meant that tis longevity was virtually confrmed now and that ABC would see it as a viable asset in the future because it got past a certain number of episodes or something. 

How much of a role would the show being involved with marvel have influenced ABCs decision on whether or not to renew or cancel future seasons? 




 With news that sony and marvel might be arguing over who the next spider-man should be it's got me a bit worried. I've been trying to think if there's anything Sony could do to possibly back out of the deal with Marvel if Sony doesn't like working with Marvel.

One would assume that Marvel/Disney aren't that stupid and they would of had their lawyers double and triple check the contract before signing it to make sure Sony couldn't find away to back out. But I'm curious if there is? Any lawyers here familiar with things like this? Would Sony be able to make a case if they don't like working with marvel and cant decide on a spider-man and want to back out of the deal. could they? 




 we already have inhumans being the substitute for x-men in the MCU now anyway. marvel doesn't need them.  




 One example I use quite often is Chris Evans in Danny Boyle's movie sunshine. such humble beginnings for an actor who would later become such a huge star. Another one is RDJ in Zodiac in 2007 before he played  Iron Man in 2008.  




 Due to TMNT2? Anyone know when filming wraps for TMNT2 and when filming for arrow commences?  




 well to me it seems like the studio has no idea wtf is going on. One day apparently bay isn't directing a week later he is then hes not. its a never ending cycle of will bay direct or not.  
























 Remember the marvel event last October? Feige said that anything that wasn't announced then was ether stll in development or just pure rumor and speculation. He was asked about Benedict Cumberbatch at the time and basically said his casting was still in negotiations and unfortunately he wasn't cast till about a month or to after the event. Feige apparently had his phone ready and waiting for the call to announce Cumberbatch at the event but these things take time. Especially when dealing with such young actors their probably nervous about signing on to such a strict contract like this.  




 They need to take their time. Marvel and sony cant afford to screw up this casting. They want this new spider-man to be the wolverine of the MCU. So whoever they cast needs to be commited and wont try and walk out on the role when the going gets tough or when they get older and want to try other things.  




 Not unless you want your jacket and whatever is in the jackets pockets to get stolen sure.  




 But I liked that movie :( 









 rage much. its an old game deal with it.  




 No it hasn't been confirmed. There has been no announcement by marvel on that one.  




 Some updates require other updates to be able to install. its normal.  














 The soundtrack for the first amazing spider-man was brilliant. I don't think James Horner gets enough credit for this. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVDrTLHZEVQ 




 Fallout 4 is coming to ps4 as well.  









 I think ill be sticking with my 970 for a while. Maybe till the GTX1100 series. what about you guys? when do you decide to upgrade? 




 With no comic con appearance this year by marvel studios could we get a spider-man announcement at D23 along with a civil war teaser? 




 pretty sure thats fake.  




 Been out of the loop for a while. Has there been any info on what the next game will be? Pokemon Z or X2 and Y2? 




 even so. hes a dragon. Sons of the Harpy should of been no match for him.  




 What were they thinking? How dare Drogon almost die like that, that was bullshit! HES A DRAGON he should burned them all. The amount of bullshit during that scene was incredible. 




 it was in game glitches. like flashing colors in assassins creed unity. strange textures in saints row the third etc.  




 Remember to wipe all previous traces of any previous drivers. I learned the hard way after suffering graphical glitches for 3 months on my new 970 only to figure out it was a driver issue and not the gpu.  




 you were talking about the cat right? XD 




 LOL christain bale would kick your ass.  




 Do we really think hes actually done with the role after 2017? Like isn't his contract running out soon? Hes probably negotiating with FOX to see how long they'll wait before they give in and drive a truck full of money up to his door step. Yea Ill believe it when I see it.  









 This is the final trailer its the labeled incorrectly.  




 It probably takes just as long to install from the disc as it would to download. So why not just buy the game digitally? I remember getting the master chief collection and despite having the disc the game ended up downloading stuff anyway. so whats the point of a physical copy? 




 I call bullshit. Marvel must be feeding them false information.  




 Probably stuff for windows 10.  




 How pissed off would you be? Do you think HBO could get away with it? would they risk cutting off some viewers of the show for a chance at making some money? 




 The first one that comes to mind is a scene from Pearl Harbor. Cant remember exactly when it happens in the movie but there's a pretty obvious scene where you can see green screen in the cockpit of an aircraft.  




 skyrim was announced at e3 2011. came out in november in that year.  









 duel.  




 Please for the love of god dont buy hp!  




 its not actually the actors themselves its just Feige sitting there in his office going hmmm what would Jamie post today and then hes like wait #itsallconnected so he posts to the thor twitter lol 




 You should of waited! why buy now when the 390x is around the corner? 









 its been clear for a while now they no longer care about the books. So why not jump the shark and have a bit fun with it? 




 Or John dies saving everyone.  




 Instead of bringing back Catelyn as lady stoneheart they should bring back Ned stark. Minds would be blown. Fans would love it and hate it.  









 sort of like the halo 4 announcement back in 2011? 




 Its xbox exclusive for Holiday 2015. Not for ever.  




 Anyone heard anything if they will be present? or is it still too early? 




 who would he be and why? 




 I'm just curious to find out why and how many people use a pirated OS. Lets not turn this into a thread of whats right and wrong.

Strawpoll. Because I can.  

http://strawpoll.me/4527342 









 Thought id make a strawpoll for this one. 
http://strawpoll.me/4527046/

I think Ant-Man will do better mostly because of its connection to the MCU. Mean while FF has already had two bad movies under its belt and people haven't forgotten those so they may not be as willing to give this reboot a chance.  









 I think marvel has big plans for Hydra and their only getting started and that paticular line in winter soldier only enforces this theory.  




 Anyone know if hes working on anything? 




 http://screenrant.com/marvel-studios-movies-tv-shows-rivalry-joss-whedon/ 




 Poor Gregg. Its shame theres so much conflict between Tv Marvel and movie Marvel.  I reckon Renner was going to appear on Shield but something happened behind the scenes to prevent it.  




 even if they did that you could just roll back the driver so it would be stupid for NVIDIA to even try something like that. It would just piss people off.  




 All that's needed now is for 4k monitors to drop to an affordable mainstream price.  




 I'm guessing it doesn't show up unless you have updates enabled?  




 why would they put him in Doctor Strange though? it doesn't make sense. That's the only other marvel movie he could appear in.  




 Got some sauce for that? 




 He didn't retire.So many of you misunderstood the end of Iron Man 3. He destroyed his suits for pepper but he never stopped being Iron Man. Thats why it was called the clean slate protocol. He wanted a fresh start and to forget the past. He even said before the credits rolled  "You can take away everything from me but there's one thing you can't take away I'm Iron Man" 




 1. Spider-Man must not have a big role in Civil War and they are filming around his scenes until they cast someone

2.Negotiations with Asa Butterfield are taking longer than expected and marvel and sony are getting nervous so they are looking at alternatives in case negations fail. 

just some food for thought.  














 imagine a launch at e3. hype. but seriously. it will be out holiday 2015.  




 Hopefully they will premiere the first 2 episodes on the same day like alot of new shows do.  




 YES! I was hoping someone would bring this up. I can totally see this replacing person of interest for me if season 5 is the final season. The pilot was so good! 




 make sure to set power management in windows to high performance. sometimes being on power saver or balanced can cause lag.  














 Not sure if its just me but the graphics in episode 4 seems rushed, especially during the previously on game of thrones intro it looks kind of pixelated in the background and in general looks worse compared to the previous episodes.  




 wtf. 









 I thought it was happening? Haven't heard anything in a long time though.  




 they are hardware developers not software developers . 




 380x is a rebranded 290x.  














 In light of Tron 3 getting canned lets talk about Tron: Legacy. What did you like about it? what did you hate? what could they have improved on in the sequel? Lets get a good discussion going! 




 id be ok with it. its better than not having the game not released at all. it means at least some people get to enjoy it.  









 I've seen July mentioned a few times haven't seen anything official though.  




 well the movie has been out for a while now and I'm sure most of us have seen it at least a couple of times to decide. Is it better than the first movie?  









 Totally agree. I have always said the consoles need to put FPS over resolution. A higher frame rate just makes the game that much more enjoyable when your not noticing stutter or clipping when moving around. It doesn't make sense to have the game running at 1080p when the hardware clearly cant handle it.  




 I think there needs to be a time jump in season 4. Have season 4 take place 1 or 2 years post season 3. That way they can get as far away from it as possible. Have Oliver and Felicity develop a proper relationship during that time off screen so we don't need to see her cry every time Oliver does something she doesn't approve of and they wont have to mention anything that happened in season 3 ether except for maybe Saras death then they can jump straight into the action in season 4. Have some devastating event that causes Oliver to come out of retirement and return to starling city and bam just like that you got season 4 the rest is up to the writers on what story they have planned hopefully its something awesome.
 














 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xed6HlatulQ 




 I loved this movie when I was younger. Thought the 3d was awesome.  




 Alternate universe? different earth? there are plenty of ways they could pull it off.  




 Can you imagine if they do a post credit scene where grunt gustin shows up and tells Ezra Millers flash that he isn't the only flash in the universe. OMG 2 barry allen's waaaaattttt 




 Wednesday usually meant a new episode of the flash for me. But not today and no Agents of Shield ether. Me sad :( 









 what if thanos in the mcu has the ability to take the form of a human and disguise himself? 




 Haven't overclocked it. still on stock clocks.  




 I hope its just that. All my other games seem to run fine. And its only this particular level on the game where this glitch happens. All the other levels appear to be fine.  




 Heres another one where the glitch is more visible. http://i.imgur.com/ryb5UQK.jpg?1 









 So the writers finally found a way to freshen up the show at the end of season 3 but fox had to ruin it and cancel it. Anyone heard if another network might pick it up? 














 gta 5 




 I got a kick out of those, some of them were really good.Why did they stop?  




 Actually 2015 is looking like a big year for E3. This is the first year they are doing a PC conference put together by AMD and various other developers and manufacturers. Its looking pretty solid imo.  














 Hey Niko! 




 Most gamers seem to stick to the 240-250gb SSD for their os then a 1tb or bigger hard drive for game storage. Does anyone actually get 1tb ssds for their os and games? 









 Why do people get so hyped for this? who wants to watch a movie without audio? and in black and white?
