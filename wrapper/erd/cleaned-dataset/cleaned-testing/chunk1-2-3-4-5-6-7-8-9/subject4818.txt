 That's interesting, I recently started playing this game and I've been watching their videos for a long time. So it was cool to find that little Easter egg  




 There's graffiti in the alley of the safe house from "The Creatures". I don't know if that's always been there, but I know they did that live stream not too long ago. 
Nova's and Sp00ns channels are spray painted on the wall saying one of them sucks.

 What is your favourite subreddit when nobody is looking? [NSFW] 





























 It's cold here, really cold here. 
I hold my breath when I go outside to start the car.  




 What's going on here?! 




 EDIT:  it's gonna cost 55$ on the spot to get it opened. 
Now I need to find 55$

 Everyone does great following the pro.

Pro lead everyone into the basement.

Everyone bags up every engine.

"What do we do now Mr.pro?"

"Have fun playing doctor you idiots"

Pro throws grenades at us and leaves. 

What an asshole. 

I proceed to lead the team. 

"Grab a bag boys"

I'm the only one who doesn't get knocked down so I take my engine to the helicopter. 

"Restart the game" everyone says

(It's a pro job)

Waiting feels like forever when I'm all alone. 

.......

..it's the right engine on the first try. Team goes bananas at my luck. 


Best feeling ever 












































 It probably knows it shouldn't have knocked over that bowl of glitter  












































 Mmeownow is the name 














 Overkill. 
Playing Big Oil with 3 pubs, one of them was a infamy 5 when it was the top, and we just barely finished it. 
Of coarse the highest level guy lead us all the way until the end of the last day when we had to bag up the right engine. 

We all stupidly bagged up each engine (first time playing it) and he got mad and left. Threw some nads at us and left. 

So i grabbed a bag and left for the helicopter and waited while the other guys went down and wanted to restart the mission. 
 
I waited out the storm and handed off the first bag and then prayed to god. And then jt happened, first bag was right! 
The other guys freaked out as I ran and made it out. Ahh, that was good.  
























 Is there a blind guy standing there watching them..
