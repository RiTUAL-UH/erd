 A Siren with a blink ability like mages in wow. I think that could be fun if it was on a low cool down or had the potential to be with her skill tree 




 ATHENAAAA :D PLSSSSSSSSSSS 




 Could you do a Commandant Steele one? :DDDDDDD 




 any chance your friend can dupe me a wep and shield??? 




 so you're saying there are more to come? 




 im on PC unfortunately :( 




 im on PC and i did them on a lower level character because a high level friend helped me with the prove yourself mission 




 i'm ok with the grind i just dunno how to get my hands on a modded wep and shield . 




 A word of warning this is one hell of a grind, there are 3 arenas to beat, each with 20 rounds and each taking about 2 hours to complete, it's not for the faint hearted 




 yeah sure lets go :D thanks ^^ 




 I decided to get back into BL1 recently and have decided to get all the achievements, just for fun, however my lvl 61 roland save file seems to be corrupt or something, long story short, i leveled a siren, im now level 50 and have lost the will to live.

 However to get the achievement for killing Craw im gonna need to be level 61 or have someone carry me, so i was wondering if there are any kind souls out there willing to carry a level 50 noob to help me get the achievement? :P

 I want S S munitions to make a return 




 he asked which bosses could be farmed rapidly. Not what loot they drop... 




 Henry 




 we all know this...... doesnt mean the game inst going to ever happen. 




 "I'm an even better slut when i'm drunk"
 




 What does RNG mean? 




 Exactly why i dont spec into anarchy. Also cos i love using my infinity WAY too much 




 i'd rather no teleporting at all, and you have to ride your mount everywhere and face the challenges a long the way, it'd make the game longer and more challenging as well as adding to the RPG elements of the game and taking less away from the immersion  




 k 




 Mounts! Instead of the old catch a ride system i feel the ability to mount up at any time just like you can in WoW would be really awesome.

I feel like mounts like these could fit really well into the game and it offers more charater custimization if you give the player access to rare mount skins or just rare mounts etc.

 These are so awesome! Think i'll have to get the "my siren's name is brick" one :P 
























 because he's asleep and there's a limited number.... hence why i asked xD 




 can someone get me a code for my friend? says i cant get another one on the same IP and he's asleep right now, if anyone can help me out that's be awesome of you :D 









 that looks fucking dope. 




 poop.
 




 Anyone got a link to this unique TF build talk??? 




 What we really said when we all started: "That champ's OP!" 




 Master yi with feral flare here. Get on my level. 









 It says that vandal twitch is on sale: http://gyazo.com/25e2e09742e682d655ed6db51c3b5fe1
However when i view the "on sale" tab in the shop it says that gangsta twitch that's on sale, not vandal.

Im on EUW im not sure it this is the same for all servers. 




 You won! :) check your inbox 




 I can pay it off, it's no worries. Appreciate the concern though :) 




 Meh, i'd rather make someone happy. 




 I accidentally bought 1 too many game Keys for Reaper of souls (it put me in my overdraft and now im going to have to pay my bank a fortune .) anyways i figured i may as well brighten someone's day by giving away the key.

Just leave a comment and i'll randomly pick one of you guys :) Good luck!


EDIT: Jojobtz won! Thanks for entering guys, sorry i couldnt give you all one :/ 




 Im still waiting for an ARAM Team Builder, riot. 




 Really hope they fix the Zed ulti bug :/ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UI3c3EY17o 




 Our clients all went black as soon as we got into champ select, anyone else had this problem? Now we get this :D http://i.gyazo.com/5ec486ee15fe51e096f570b8a3429ad2.png 




 i really feel like you shouldn't force us to pick what champion we'd like to play and instead allow us to just queue for the position we want so that it could be used for ranked draft pick. 




 I played 2 before i played 1 and i have to say it didn't really change much, i fell in love with BL2 and it was that that made me want to play BL1. The story is BL1 is SERIOUSLY BAD i learn almost nothing playing through the game and ended up googling most of it to piece the story together. So in conclusion play which ever you like first :) 




 Im down, add Fuzzy on steam :) 




 wouldnt this get me a VAC ban or something? is it legal basically? 




 Im sorry for your loss, i truly am :/ and yeah i agree the whole "it gets easier" shit people say is a bunch of bollocks, the highest suicide rates in america are white males above the age of 80 and people are saying it gets better!? That said I think you'll go far buddy, school was something i never did too well at, but keep studying hard if school is something you can deal with. 
























 I truly hope i never see flying mounts in WildStar. As a long time WoW player, before flying mounts were introduced, traveling was exciting! You had to be careful not to aggro mobs or perhaps fight your way through areas, you got to see other players along the way and see the monsters they were fighting, you had to meander your way through the environment and sometimes you'd discover hidden, tucked away NPCs and villages you never knew existed before. It made the game feel alive!

Once flying mounts were added the game felt so stale when traveling, you saw a few mountains and poorly rendered villages below that you quickly glided over in a straight line, trying to get from A to B in the fastest way possible. It was boring!

So please Carbine, never add flying mounts, keep traveling as fun as possible. 




 I feel like the questing would be amazing if they just added more voice acting, problem is that's expensive. Wonder if there are any voice actors who're fans of WildStar and would do it for free :P I know i certainly would. 




 but it still says ive got 15 wins 15 losses after a team builder game not like my 1500+ normal wins and losses :/ 




 source? 




 Riot said they'd change it this patch IIRC, but have they? 




 dunno my friend went to an all star party at some pub. Im from near Newport so dont really know much else on the matter. 




 There's even league events in Bristol :P 




 This is by far the easiest and most simpe tool, literally just press a button and it'll tell you your ping http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/19id2r/nifty_little_tool_to_check_your_ping_na_and_euw/ 




 Oh god i can see all the cosplayers that get WAY to into character being all like "EE KAA DOOO!!!!" 




 For a few patches now the mute button has been missing, it used to be next to the add friend/report/honor buttons but has since been removed. Why? 




 http://gyazo.com/db12f2b79980b6ed29b1c3c8681bb8c4 :D 




 same with annie's W which is find weird condering you can stop stuff like vel'koz's W 




 [/caitlyn] did i do it?

EDIT: fuck. 




 How the almighty shits do i lane as Yasuo? 




 As a Zed main i wish they'd fix the W + Q bug and the bug where he just stands still after using his ult 




 I added you on league and yet you're not on my friends list :( The unseen friend request is the loneliest. Y U DECLYN MI LUV? 




 The unseen Zed mains are the jealous...ist....? 




 I get accused of hacking when i play zed at least once a month. Because putting a fucking insane amount of practice into a champ cant be the reason you were able to kill me, you must be hacking! . 




 Anyone else had the annoying ult bug(?) where you're chancing an enemy and you go to cast your ult but because of the cast time you end up stopping, the enemy walks out of range and the ult never goes off, so end up stutter stepping? Has made me quite tempted to run move speed quints on her xD 




 What is OP is wrong, what if Gosu is actually Kaceytron? 




 Nah he's actually Kaceytron. 




 yeh something like that, but if i remeber correctly it's due to the dominion pros practicing on that day or something, so you get paired with super good players xD 
























 yay! :D 




 Zed pretty pleaseeeeeeeeeee? :D 




 As a Zed main FUCK 4.10 first the exhaust buff now botrk is fucking awful on him :( 




 It's best if you download more RAM first 




 A HOUR!? 




 Welcome to the big dick club. 




 Just download more RAM, np. 




 i would love the cursor to be a cross hair like attack click, just let us choose from a selection of cursors rito 




 FUCK. 




 I wish i was as cool as you :/ 




 just the new one is plugged into my motherboard, the other 2 are hooked up to my PSU 




 I recently bought a new 140mm fan for my PC to replace the old noisey one. The one i removed was one that simply connects to my PSU, the one i installed has a 4 pin pwm connector that i plugged into my motherboard.

Installation was simple enough, booted up my pc and the fan i had just install was spinning pretty slow. So i opened my PC up again, unplugged it, vacantly gawped at it and as im not a hardware kinda guy just plugged it back in assuming it was just some weird one off issue.

and BOOM the new fan started running much faster, was definately shifting some air about, however now a different fan, an old 120mm fan was now rotating much slower when before it would move some serious air just fine.

So what's the issue here because ive searched online and found nothing, is it a problem with my PSU?? 




 Thank you, kind sir :) 




 ive never understood it :( ELI5? 




 Azoh the legendary Zed main said he really liked my name and wished he had it (A to Zed) made me all warm and fuzzy inside. 




 just look at the public chat rooms on the clients, there are thousands of people advertising elo boosting :/ 




 I THINK EVERYONE IN ALLIANCE AND DIGNITAS IS REALLY AWESOME AND COOL 




 I can picture every person ive ever met smiling, Even if ive only met them briefly or have never seen them smile. 




 I'm worried for my baby :( 




 I played all the champs and settled with Zed. 




 ok, thank you :)

 How can trees be real if our eyes aren't real? 




 i hate "I HAVE INSOMNIA" no you dont you just didnt get much sleep the past couple of nights... 




 How much IP do you get at the end though? if it's the same as normal bots games that'd be pretty lame 









 he is actually correct i once had a friend who saw 60fps for 5 seconds and his eyeballs exploded :/ he is blind now. 




 Or 6. The number 6. Think about it six has 3 letters, 3 x 2 = an upside down 9. 9 is the prime number of 23, 23 is equal parts 2 and 3. 2 x 3 = 6. Coincidence? I think not. 




 Man, remember when this shit would show up on summoner showcase? :( those were the days 




 but do u play c8, m8? 




 yeah! exactly like i was really really exhausted and was completely done with the world, and if my bloods didnt stabilise when they did we wouldnt be having this conversation. I just hope there arent diabetics out there that are depressed and dont know why :/ it's such a simple cure 




 damn :/ Thank you though :) 




 Ive got an insane number of things happening in my life that'd depress anyone but ever since i started insulin 3 months ago my depressed rather suddenly came to an end, and i never really found out what caused it or for that matter, ended it. So i was wondering, did anyone else get depressed BEFORE finding out they got diagnosed, due to high blood sugar etc?? and did i then go once starting insulin? Just curious 




 ah TIL. Im here in the UK :P your system seems more accurate though 




 are glasses paid for by the NHS if needed? 




 can someone explain? i only recently got diagnosed and i was ignorant before . 




 I got told i had diabetes a few months after a pretty severe car crash (which is believed to be the cause) and i remember waking up on 2 occasions feeling INSANELY hungry along with shaking and other low symptoms. Is that normal? was it caused by the diabetes??? 




 my mum and sister use this one on me all the time! it drives me mad! My girlfriend has yet to do so which is pretty nice, but i hope that one day she'll pick up on the signs that im low, might save my life one day who knows xD 




 btw folks a normal person's blood sugar is meant to be around 4-7 so you can imagine how rough these guys where feeling. Diabetes sucks, I wouldnt be here if i hadnt gotten diagnosed when i did, not because of the diabetes itself but because of the depression it caused. If you're depressed, peeing a lot, drinking a lot, get cramps, etc then get it checked out you could have type 1. 




 Hey man, it's rude to talk with your mouth open. 




 I THINK HE SAID HE LOVES IT WHEN REDDIT TURNS INTO A RICH CUNT 




 I don't think that's possible, sir. 




 You need a bigger desk. 
























 ah sorry, i misunderstood. Thanks for clearing that up ^^ 




 there's only 1 fan of knives in the deck you linked, are you saying you run 0 fan of knives? O.o 









 I got all the Borderlands 1 achievements solo.........Never again. 




 Thanks buddy 3 




 just out of curiosity what is the desk? i want to get 2 of them and have a desk surrounding me xD 









 where does Zed keep his massive dick? 




 you seem friendly. 




 No one gets that my username is a reference to this awesome game :( 









 ULTIMATE ZED SKIN!? RITO PRETTY PLEASE! :DDD 




 No thank YOU! 




 V-Moda M100s baby! SO GOOD 




  3 :) 




 *fart noises* 




 and if you're asking about what bezel means it's the strips of plactic around a screen that hold it together :P 




 wrong, gosu is actually kaceytron's smurf 




 Slowly so i can say goodbye to everyone. 




 um actually no that is not correct. It is in fact what i linked you.

 What if she WAS the weird alien in TPS? What if the destroyer didnt kill her. It changed her and that's why you dont see any alien creatures in BL2 because the destroyer created them before it died. There are so many questions surrounding that character and no one seems to care about her! . I wanna know if she was the siren Lilth was searching for when she came to pandora, they share VERY similar tattoos so it's entirely possible. 




 Yeah dude! Hence why i wanna know more about her! :D as for the hole in her, who's to know? Perhaps it was merely a robot. Her siren tattoos look more like circuitry/wires and she displays no siren ability when you fight her. Who's to say it was her at all and not just a robot? OOOOO CONSPIRACYYYYYYY! xD 




 Agreed. Not to mention deathtrap is disgustingly OP in the early levels 




 gunzerker only really gets fun at level 30 onward if you ask me 




 It's because gamespy was shut down or something i think so if they didnt do it BL1 would have no multiplayer what so ever. It's nice that they did that, but it's something that should have happened a long time ago. Much like an FoV slider for the PC port :/ but hey cant really complain too much 




 yeah i know :/ she was a scrapped concept for lilth. But damn i'd like to know more about her :( 




 Her siren power was regeneration? that'd be interesting. 




 oh really? my bad i'll delete it then 




 agreed BL1 had the best loot system. Even just opening chests was exciting there was a much greater chance of cool shit. In the other BL games it's always greens/whites in chests :/ 




 Like what's her siren ability if she even was one? Like why did Atlas leave her on pandora? How did she rise to power? How did she even become involved in Atlas/the crimson lance? What if her siren ability is to heal herself and that the destroyer never really killed her? 




 I would love the return of Atlas! and commandant steele :'( Gearbox please. 




 I know but it leaves so many unanswered questions. 




 S S went out of business due to bandit guns being more successful. Also i agree with you BL2 weapons certainly have that feel to them but BL1 guns were simply more fun :/ 




 apparently BL2 was found to only have 5 million different guns where as BL1 has almost 18 million 




 I don't see why they restricted themselves so much after BL1 with these weapons types restricted so heavily by their manufacturer. Lets face it every torgue assault rifle is the same. Every Hyperion sniper rifle is the same and so on. 

We want innovation. We want to see Torgue sniper rifles and Jakobs rocket launchers and just generally more variety within all weapon types no? 




 Was anyone else hoping for some closure surrounding Commandant Helga Steele in TPS? I mean there's so much mystery surrounding that character and yet no one seems to want to know more about her. She hasn't been mentioned once since BL1. No echos. Nothing. 




 Yeah it's widely considered the best DLC out of all the BL franchise.  




 Ive been too both. Im really struggling to work out what im missing :/
 




 yeah ive done them all and ive been there :/ 




 hey guys im having trouble finding all the named locations onboard the Helios station. I was wondering if you know of any hidden places :) I've got the other two location achievements. 




 Literally ANYTHING Atlas/Commandant Steele related OH GOD PLEEEEEEEEASE! .

EDIT: Or how every claptrap unit got destroyed by jack but i have a feeling that'll be a DLC already 
























 Thanks, buddy :) 




 Yeh the auction info. I figued it was auctioneer but which part of it specifically should i disable to remove it? :P 




 The extra information on the item http://prntscr.com/6ceoms 




 oooooooooo cold. xD 




 i mean it's cheap so you can easily replace it if it does. but i dont own the knife so i cant say. 




 after a very quick search i found it in black. im sure you can find it in silver if you just search "balisong trainer" http://www.amazon.com/Black-Metal-Practice-Trainer-Sheath/dp/B00H977EJW/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1420948412 sr=8-1 keywords=balisong+trainer

 I bought it was a collectors piece. I like the way it looks, it's not a nice that will get any use.
 




 Thank you :) i answered Khthonic's question in a  reply to him if you wanna check that out :P 




 thanks man i'll check them out! :) 




 This Knife has Fire Storm pattern Damascus steel blade, made By 1095/15N20 ALLOY STEELS (176 true Layers) Hand forged. Not amazing steels, i'll give you that. 




 well i bought it from www.poshland.co.uk if that helps :) 




 i wanted to see it's chopping power when i first got it... placed a plastic bottle cap on the floor, cut it clean in half.... and my carpet xD
 




 the indented blade is for batoning wood (notice how the top of the blade above it is curved, perfect for hitting with another piece of wood like a club/hammer). where as the curved blade (the belly) is more for your everyday stuff :) 




 actually the model for that is based of this knife https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=mtech+usa+xtreme+mx-8054 espv=2 biw=1680 bih=965 source=lnms tbm=isch sa=X ei=kESxVM2aBJDgaM-cgMgE ved=0CAcQ_AUoAg

 It appears to be made by a company called "Stainless Steel". Hope this helped.

 Yeah I got particularly salty after a bad day at college so it makes sense. But alright man thanks for the clarification :) 




 Yeah I got my first one the other day and was quite shocked. You think I'll still get the Mundo skin and mystery skin at the end of the season then?  




 If you get a warning for negative behnaviour but no punishment will you still be eligible for rewards? 




 Damn, i was hoping he died or something.... this is just awful :( He will be missed. 




 Also for the record can we get a noise when lux's Q hits in fog of war? it's never made a noise and if it did it'd be an awesome quality of life change 




 GRID would be super cool 




 Yeah so Vote to Kick feature when? 




 Consider this comment my formal entry to said giveaway, good sir.
