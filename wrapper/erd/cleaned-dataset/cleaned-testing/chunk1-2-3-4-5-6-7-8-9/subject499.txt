 There's a whole mass of people who do vlogs just about books and co, why not contact some of them? I'm sure they would love to help promote new writers. 




 That's half the battle =]

Though editing *is* harder. 




 You have to want it hard enough =] 




 I did very little yesterday: it made me want to do more today. After today, I'm feeling pretty awesome about myself, like I want to be this productive everyday! I would pick a productive week over an unproductive week anyday. I get more tired doing nothing. 




 Wrote over 1k words into my novel.

Finished a long over-due script for an indie game I'm working on.

Read nearly 80 pages of my book (The Silmarillion) 

And got to play some Xbox and spend time with my grandma.

How have you spent your sunday, CC'ers? 




 In order to produce a (just short of) 80k word novel. That is all you need to write. I know people who can spit out 1000 words in an afternoon. If you've ever been discouraged about writing, or how long it would take to write a novel. Bear that in mind. 

1500 words a week. 




 Yep, that's the issue. However at that length there shouldn't be any qualms cutting it in two. Better than removing 50k words of story. No problems or issues making it a two-parter. Just have to rewrite the middle into a semi-ending and then a beginning for the second half. Of course you should still cut. Any extraneous that needs to be cut *needs* to be cut. That's one of the most important things in editing. 




 That does sound interesting...I would probably read that. I don't see a lot of superhero novels.

Also, why 50k, yikes? 




 I live in England. Mother's day was months ago. Begone! 




 There was a moment when I could have got a book for free from Amazon. It had (finally) been delivered that morning, and later on I got a call saying that - to the best of their knowledge - the item hadn't turned up and I could get a refund. I hesitated, but told them the book had arrived. Also, it was a 20 book. I could'a got a 20 book for free. 




 Editing is the worst. And I thought writing a novel was difficult. Until I had to edit it.

Cut out 18k words. That was damn painful. Tell me about your novel =] 




 *The Amber Spyglass, by Philip Pullman*

And, *The Goblet of Fire, By Rowling*

I was thirteen when I read both of those. I think TGOF hadn't been out too long, it was before TOOTP came out. I don't quite remember the exact moment where I knew what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. I just remember I read those two books at the exact right point in my life and from then on that's what I would do. I would write.

I also wrote a really short story when I was 7. I was with my two sisters and two cousins and they were drawing, but I couldn't draw, I hated it. So I wrote a story instead. I guess I was born to be a writer =] 




 My uncle - Crash Bandicoot on the PS1. I was so enamoured with that game I don't even know why. I can't remember the point where I thought *"This is the best thing I have ever seen in my short, little life."* I forsook my family while we were visiting my uncle just to play my cousins PS1. After that I had to have my own. It's been a sharp decline ever since. 




 Thanks. That book itself is actually kinda shit haha. But we learn from our mistakes. And thankyou =]  




 Will do. Let me just put it into the GDocs =] I'll PM you the link. 




 Personally I dislike prompts. They're never your own ideas, and they're never as good as anything you could come up with; if not by virtue of being purely *your own.*

Yes, I recommend loose planning. A solid direction to go with enough room for your characters to breathe. However, if your characters go off the rails, follow them, don't ever bring them back. Just follow it through. Eventually it will lead back to a major event. I introduced an entirely new character this way who didn't exist until the moment my other two characters stumbled across him - he just appeared to them and to me - and he was pivotal in the final scenes. It really changed the whole book and for the better just because he was in it. 




 There was actually a section, I wouldn't mind having someone read over (though it is in the very premature stages of an early first draft). If you're interested... 




 Is that the sort of stuff you write? 




 That is true. That's my motto:

*Progress for it's own sake.*

Thanks =] 




 I don't read Japanese novels I'm afraid. I did read The Buried Giant, by Ishigurio, but that doesn't really count does it? Though it was a decent read. 

But they aren't really those kind of spirits. I've tried my best to keep them separate so they are purely my own spirits and they adhere to the fictional rules of a fictional religion I have full control over. It's important to the story. And though I have in some cases constrained myself with my own rules, I need to know how they work, because I have to keep tabs on the effect they have on the characters. 

However, Japanese culture and spirits are something really interesting to me and I will look into those two authors, if you have recommendations... 




 Honestly, inspiration is almost wholly useless. If I'm not inspired at the beginning of a story I won't write it down. Inspiration will take me through maybe 3,000 words. I think in one case it got me to 8,000 before I lost interest in it. 

The trick is to write without inspiration or motivation - they're both too fickle to be trusted. Those few ideas you get, see them through to the end. If you don't get a lot of ideas, make the most of the ones you have. Push through them without inspiration. That's the best thing you can do. It's the only way to finish anything really. 




 Try writing something short. It's a really good skill to get the context of a situation in just that situation alone. If you want to write a certain scene that's more interesting to you, then do it. To conjure up smaller scenes and see if they can come together is basically how everything I write begins. This novel was three small ideas, and then I had a big idea and then I worked the smaller ideas into the big idea and brought them all together. That's just the second stage in the idea process. 

For my first novel I didn't organise. I had an idea of the major events and just drove my characters into those events. I didn't like planning because thinking up what happens next is much more exciting, because I know only as much as the characters do what happens. Because of that, and a lack of plan, the novel went off rails and finished at the 125k words mark. 

This novel I've planned out, though somewhat loosely, and allocated each part 30k words - 90k altogether, which is a much better place to stop a novel. To organise this I simply wrote down my ideas into a pad. I wrote a short story set in the same universe, revolving around the spirits, and a lot of the religion came from the ideas I got whilst writing that short and that religion was monumental in planning the novel. It was just back and forth a lot on a notepad. Filling in plot-holes, creating character arcs, looking at a wide overview and fixing any issues. Whilst trying to take the characters into the best, and most interesting, places. 




 No. But a fictional and extinct religion does exist in my book. It plays a super important part. And the rules that governed the religion (and therefore spirits) I had to set up before I could properly work out what happened in the book. Any time I made a step forward with the fictional religion was a huge break-through in the story.

But real religions, no. I wouldn't anything I wrote to be seen as an allegory or a message involving religion, that's not what I write about. 




 Thanks. That's the sort of thing I'm super relieved to hear. I had a huge moment of doubt a few weeks ago and lost *all* faith in not only the idea but my capabilities as a writer, and I nearly gave up writing for good. So it's great to hear that the idea (at least in it's basic form) isn't a terrible one. 




 Hey I do! Slowly. I've got a lot going on so progress on the book is super-slow . But I don't think, overall, it's going terribly. There's just a lot of distractions. 




 I've been wanting to write since I was 13. I finished my first novel...a year and a half ago? ( Ish :/ ). This book in particular was inspired by the worlds of Neil Gaiman, whose bibliography is built on worlds set in our own, but with something else inside of them that tends to remain secret. His books always feel like these worlds are bigger than they seem and we're only granted a small portion of it. 

But then I had my own ideas and my own situations and I brought them altogether and hopefully something good will come out of it. 




 In short, malevolent spirits. It shows the lives of a young boy and girl and how they are affected by, and deal with, the spirits at different times in their lives. 




 I'm starting to get bored and want to talk to someone about anything. Instigate a conversation I don't mind about what, you choose. 




 Mate I've got a degree in film and media. That ain't gunna stop me being published. 




 You have to leave

'Cause if you don't, dear

You'll never see the things you read about in books

You saw the films and you were hooked

But everything you want won't come to you

You realize now that you've gotta go see this through 




 It was all alphabetical by author's last name, but I bought about 15 books since I set up my bookshelf so now...I need to redo it. And because there's a lot of new books to put in it would probably be easier to take them all down and start again. *sad face*. 




 Writing my second novel. My sister is (should be) reading and editing the first in the hopes to get it sent to some agencies. In the meanwhile, my new novel is coming along very slowly. 




 I need to JDATE again before i read TBIFOS I think. Which means I might buy paperback - because I own JDATE on Kindle, which is a sin. I can't own a physica copy of a sequel and not its predecessor.  




 I have this same problem, it's such a bitch. And it makes deciding what to read next super hard. I try and maintain a system but nope. 




 But you don't want anyone reading your first draft. You want to make a manuscript as polished as possible before anyone reads it. Just so your feedback isn't just warning you about issues you could already have edited out; that renders the feedback wholly useless. There's different stages, and editing without any external influence is one of them, and followed immediately by getting someone else to read it.  

If you can convince someone to read your work and look at it the right way - an overall view rather than a view critical towards style, then you might be ok. 


 




 What I meant was it's all part of that saga. They're the three main middle-earth(/Beleriand) novels. 




 I ordered a book about three hours ago! =]

*The Cement Garden, by Ian Mcewan*. Coming from Waterstones, hopefully early next week.

I have a problem with buying books. I managed to get my backlog down to less than twenty, and now it's rocketed back up :(  




 It's really become an archetype now that we readers of high-fantasy (mostly) want long series. They prefer reading a longer book.

Publishers prefer series. They're more likely to gain momentum (and therefore money). It's a safe gamble that if a person likes the first book they will read the rest of the series. More money for publishers, more sales for authors.

Also the whole world-building thing everyone else mentioned. 

Mostly, I think, because scale and epicness can't be measured in a single novel, or two. Harry Potter uses all 6 books to lead us to the intense finale. Who hasn't enjoyed seeing Westeros unfold tale-by-individual-tale? 




 And The Hobbit ;) 




 I'm sorry if that came off harsh, it wasn't meant to. :/ I just read what I put, sorry if it came off wrong. It was meant to be helpful, it sounds harsh. 




 This just shows that you're writing normally, and, as mentioned, you are taking it seriously. If you weren't questioning yourself, and thinking you were doing badly, you wouldn't be writing properly. That's how it is. You're like me, like a lot of writers. You like having written, but you don't like writing. Your friends sound like they enjoy writing but fuck 'em, everyone writes differently. Everyone writes different things and to get different things out of it. It doesn't matter. Stop talking to them. You're writing and if you're not writing by yourself then you fail at it by default. Writing is inherently lonely, and I'm not saying that to sound angsty, I'm saying it because I know the best way to get anything is done is to not get distracted by, or involve, anyone else. 

No one expects your novel to be a grown up. It's a first draft, it is a baby. *Do not ever expect anything else*. You are not a good writer. You write for infants. And you **edit** your book into adulthood. First draft is gunna be crap. Second is only marginally better. I worked on my own novel for an entire year and went through more than ten drafts (I could have shot myself). Parts of it are unrecognizable from the original and that is such a good thing I can't even tell you. 

Writing isn't easy, you just gotta sit down and do it, take breaks if you want, though I'm sure you feel they are anti-productive and therefore undesirable. So just write, push through it. If it feels like you're writing shit, that's fine. If it's slightly better - but still shit - that's even more fine. It's gunna be shit until you edit it into oblivion. 




 Seems like your friend needs to read more. Read more and see how it's done. 




 The ability to self-evaluate can't be understated. Eventually you're going to want people to read it over and evaluate you work for you. Getting an opinion other than your own is above essential. The thing is a lot of your flaws you might work out naturally. A lot of your writing flaws you might edit out - and that's what editing is for. 

Like Stephen King said - "write with the door shut. Edit with the door open." 

My advice is to continue working until your manuscript is as perfect as you think it can be. Any weaknesses you feel are in it, address them as best you can. If you don't, any feedback will be just to tell you to fix things you could already have fixed, rather than any issues you actually have in your writing. 




 Here's the thing, if we advise you to do one, and you try and write it, but aren't convinced you wanna write *that one*, you won't write it.

Write all three. Bring them all together. The last two could stand as a single-plot on their own. If you make the society perhaps dystopic it's not too hard to put in some time-travel there as well.

I'm not going to give you ideas, that's cheating. If you want to write professionally idea generation is a massive part of that. It's not just the genesis of the idea or conjuring up the opening paragraphs. It's coming up with the entire novel and it's a skill that comes with practice.

Of course, if you're not writing professionally ignore my advice. Almost all of my advice tends to be geared towards people who write seriously, rather than just as a hobby.  




 *The cement garden*? Interesting title. Fucked up, you say? *researches* 

*Ian McEwan?!*

*Purchases*

Thanks, stranger =] 




 I have never seen Pacific Rim. *Sad face.* But I feel like all of these films are being held up to be something they're not. Sometimes I want my characters deep and well rounded, and their plot arcs to be beautifully intricate. Sometimes I wanna see a guy punching bad guys dressed up as a bat and growling. 




 Here's to hoping. Good luck with your audio/tech thing =] 




 A lot of people complained about Age of Ultron saying there wasn't enough characterisation, and their motivations were too thin and blah blah. I don't care about characters! I want to see demi-gods punch the living shit out of each other. Same with Jupiter Ascending (from what I saw), it just looked like a gorgeous film where a space-elf beats up people for a woman for who-cares-what-reason. 




 Yeah, my thing doesn't sound as bad as that. Not even by half. Kudos. 




 I heard different things about Jupiter Ascending. I don't think it even made it to cinema's in the UK. I'm sure it will appear out of the blue in the stores one day. 

I've heard good things about iZombie but I already have so many shows to watch, I can't bear to start a new one.  




 Any movie recommendations? I'm staring at my dvd's blankly. 




 Camera-operator for a live shopping channel. I can do it all, but I'm not as confident on one of the camera's, and it's just a *lot* of running around. Which doesn't help when you can't shout and have to stay ridiculously quiet. I've been looking at it from the bright side;*" the new guy can run the entire floor by himself after he's been here for only a few weeks."* 




 I feel you, being ditched by co-workers. But I work for a live TV channel (it's not as exciting as it sounds). So I had to manage three cameras and a trainee and run the floor by myself. I'm meant to be with two other people but nope, abandoned. 









 If you could, and were part of a band, what would you name it? 




 Hey guys, like I said. Any tips or things to bear in mind, or practices just to get better that you think would benefit me. I've been playing for a while, and my friend has given me a bit of instruction, but I'm pretty new, so anything is appreciated. Thanks. 




 I'm trying to write my novel, and need help procrastinating. I know it sounds anti-helpful but it's not. It's super useful.

So, just start a conversation, talk about anything! =] 














 You know. I've read LOTR, though a few years ago. Since then I've read a lot of what could be considered 'contemporary fantasy', and even though I absolutely adored them. Tolkien truly was the master. 




 I used to hate the idea of work. Of getting up and doing the same thing every day of every month of every year without cease. I used to hate it when people said they were looking forward to the weekend because it seemed like such a waste of a life to spend 5 days waiting for the other 2. I had respect for the nine-to-fivers, I never knew how they did it. 

I want to be a writer. But now I'm working my 9-5, mon-fri, and I'm one of those people who spend 5 days of the week waiting hopefully for the other two. 




 I'm actually quite nearly finished this. Overall it has been a very easy read. A decent book complimented by it's fairly short length. If it was any longer, I don't think I would enjoy it as much. It is compact, and that really works in its benefit. It isn't as heavy a book as I thought it would be, or maybe as the author intended it to be, but it has its moments. I've laughed, and some of the one-liners about humanity have hit me. I would recommend. 




 That is the question of my dinner tonight.

**Edit: I McDonald'ed** 




 What book, once you finished it, haunted you for weeks afterwards? Hit a chord so deep it never truly left?

Mine was "The Virgin Suicides" by Jeffrey Eugenides. I still think about that from time to time, it never left me. 




 We got in touch not that long ago, and we haven't seen much of each other. So it's really nice to get back in touch with an old friend I hadn't talked to in 6-7 years. But then he invited me to go rock climbing and, what the hell, I got out of a long term relationship not so long ago, I'm not doing anything with my life. So I'm getting to know him better and hopefully will meet some of the friends he's made. My ex got all our friends in the separation so it's definitely to get out and *meet some new people*.

Also, goddamn. My hands have been ripped to shreds, he had to buy some finger tape because it was so bad. I pretty much can't lift my arms, and I stumbled and had to crawl up the stairs. But I had such a good time. 




 Ever since I was quite young, about thirteen (possibly much younger), I've made a hot chocolate, snuggled up in bed and read my book. I'm in my mid-twenties now and I still do that whenever possible. That's my usual ritual.

What's yours? 




 Is really all it took to get over Writer's Block. To find that when I am finally called away that I've written a lot, and I don't want to stop, and I can carry on now for hours. Simple as.

Just something to bear in mind the next time you sit down, but maybe don't want to write just right this moment. 




 I've got about twenty books to read. And I'm doing the 52 books a year challenge, so I've got to pace my reading.

I've bought video games I haven't played, and some I've barely played.

I've got a novel to write.

I've also got to write part of a script for a video game I'm working on that was due a few weeks ago.

And shows I'd like to watch on Netflix (which don't take precedence but still)

And on top of this I work a steady 9-5.

Any ideas/suggestions for how to slug through all of that? How do you manage to be productive? 




 My dreams are fire.

That fire is the clarity of my

being, to show me more

than I could ever have been.  


I dream, oh how I have.  



And the rage, and the passion, and the

Heat, and tongues of that fire

Had licked my conscious desire;

And I knew that in that one, tiny

Infinitesimal, minute moment

I could be more than this.

And yet.

And yet.

Oh, but still

That it were possible to be all 

My dreams

Have foreseen.

And not this, 

Hollow

Impassioned

Being

Of caged-fire

And dewy eyed 

Desire

 Sure, I get up and I drive to work. And I pay a decent portion of my wages to keep my car going, and towards tax and rent.

But when I was a child I never ate ice-cream on my double bed, watching Netflix on my 50" TV. Being an adult...it really ain't that bad. 




 I'm just curious to hear your stories. How old were you? Did anything bring it on. Just though you'd give it a try? Or were you just touched by God spontaneously and thought 'I will write now'? 




 Or, generally, in your possession. The book you liked least and hated most.

Mine is probably *Under The Skin, by Michael Faber*. Did not like that book. 









 I'm tucked up in bed with my new book (The Buried Giant), and don't plan on moving, except for Sunday Lunch - and then it's straight back to my bed and book.

Anyone else got a similar day planned? 




 So apparently this guy is quite famous, I guess I was too young to remember him. So far though this book is amazing. Will be picking up *'Never Let Me Go'* very soon. 




 So. We are meeting again,

You. You who still haunt my

Every waking hour

To you I am to blame

For this shell I call home.

For whom I blame for this neglect, destitution.

I am a man.

I am a boy.

I am a human.

I am everything you

Should have known

You would leave me as.

You who are so bitter

So spiteful, you who would

Break skin for the malevolence,

For the colour; blood.

And unto me you left this

Learners scar, 

So you could be a poet.

I am a poet,

You are a fool.

You are a child, you are

The neglectful little malignance

That is the abode of my every whim,

You are the little malicious 

Greed that left me to thirst

As you fed this fire.

This pen wouldnt fit so 

Perfectly

In my teeth if you hadnt

Shown me how to hold it.

You are not a man

You are not a boy

You do not consider yourself human,


You are an object,

Arent you?

To which your derision is 

Well with no bottom.

They always seemed justified to treat you 

differently.

And you are the bitter 

Little worm,

As I am the bitter 

Little snake.

As you were so drowned in your self-pity.

I am still wet from your 

Macabre, oh-so philosophical 

Insights.

Shallow as a piss puddle

If you must.

The puppet on the strings

As you were,

But I see that not.

God I hate you,

I hate

I do not hate those scars

On your arm,

Not so much as

Your fathers disappointment,

But a lesson you taught

Yourself

Well.

How alive we are.

Just you and me.

I am the form you wish you had,

But having said that

There will be more poems

To come.

 Never really listened to any podcasts, but looking to get into some. Maybe just one that I can listen through if it's a decent one. I'm looking for some about literature or writing (in that vein), and am taking recommendations.

Note: I know nothing about podcasts.  




 It was a pleasure to read a book that felt like a throwback to the days of geniune dystopians: 1984, Brave New World, Fahrenheit-451. There was a moment when the government seemed infallible. Like being made pretty made sense, but was also humanely wrong; like the wars in 1984, the brainwashing in Brave New World. They were even setting it up like that. 

But then no, revolution it is. Same old contemporary YA bs. 

Too much to ask for a dystopian like the old classics? Come on, I'm sick of the underdog, one person throwing over an entire government? Sick of it now. 




 Is that I there is not enough time in a single life to read every book I will inevitably want to read. That I will die unsatisfied, knowing there was a myriad of books I had never gotten to read. 

Until then; **READ READ READ** 









 *(Probably spoilers ahead).*

Well, the entire trilogy. I don't see a lot of people talking about it and thought I would very much enjoy to meet people who liked it as much as me.

So, what are your thoughts on The His Dark Materials Trilogy? 




 Just an adventure story about a group of kids doing something unbelievable and awesome. COME ON! 




 Please don't hate me! Just the text get's hidden by that griever on the background, and I can't read a fair portion of text on my screen. It just blends into it. Please change it? =[

But also please don't hate me. *cowers* 




 How the majority of YA books have to have some reference to 'The Hunger Games'. Fuck off Hunger Games, those books were terrible. What was a fantastic YA trilogy? The Maze Runner. Let me just go over to my copy: *"A must for fans of the Hunger Games"*. The Hunger Games wishes it could be half as good as The Maze Runner. Westerfelds *Uglies*: *Before the Hunger Games there was...*. Because even a book published before THG still has to live up to it. 

So it's not so much the books as the covers. I just dislike that a book can't stand on it's own merits, it has to be likened to something else which is, in this case, **vastly inferior**.

(Yeah, ok, I really, **really** hated the last Hunger Games novel.)

But it's true with any trend. Any book that becomes popular others have to try and steal that glory. I just want good books to stand on their own merits and not have to attempt to steal the fame of others. It's cheap. 

I'm sure there are more examples but I can't think of 'em right now.

tl;dr: when book covers reference whichever series is the most famous right now. I hate it.

 




 Heard different things about this book. I gather from the reviews that it's like Marmite: you love it or hate it. There is no middle ground. 









 I loved the Virgin Suicides but haven't heard much about Middlesex, looking to get some insider knowledge on whether it's worth reading, or best to avoid. 




 It's a difficult thing spending four years on a novel and then, at the end of it, stepping back and realising it's probably, most likely, kinda, just a bit shit. 

It is my first novel, and I've spent about a year editing it, but no one else has actually read it, which I know is a huge flaw. But is it worth attempting to publish it if I feel this way. Traditionally publish I mean - sending it out to agencies to seek representation. Worth it just in case? Or not all, shove it in a drawer and forget about it?

I'm not scared of rejection, not at all. That isn't the case. If I decide to at least try, then rejections will just be a part of that, I accept that. It's more about how I feel towards the novel. 




 Why do you think Neil Gaiman's books are so popular?

His writing style? Content? Imagination? Worlds? What made him so astronomically popular, in your opinion?

And I do just mean his writing, not so much his Twitter or Sandman series. I just mean his novels and short story collections.

 




 Who doesn't love them some classical utopic-dystopia? 




 "With just a handful of men,

we'll start all over agai-"

*Damn it. Everytime!* 




 So I'm planning on starting a let's play soon. I can record output from consoles, and record film. What I can't do however is sync up video from a DSLR to video-game footage. Any hints about how to go about doing this?

Note: Recording from consoles, anything used to record from computer can't be used. I have software to record from console, but no way to use an external camera with it.

I don't want to use my webcam, because I have a HD DSLR I would rather use. 




 I've always shunned books on how to write. My thoughts on this have always been: "A book can't teach me how to write. The only way to get better at writing is by writing. And all the time I've spent reading, I could have spent actually writing."

But I'm starting to think otherwise. Is it ever worth reading a book teaching you how to write? If so, recommend some. I'm really considering it.

 




 [The Old Gods](https://drive.google.com/open?id=16OmmuY5uaQ-rlTq_HWMgLnbbooRE2UAnimgmCujKTD0 authuser=0)

New novel-in-progress. Looking for overall feedback, but also feedback on the style, and the consistency of the style, especially towards the end.

Thanks! 
:) 




 Honestly the damage isn't much greater than my cleaver, but it's a lot slower to swing. It is new, so is it something I have to stick with? or...
 




 Blood-Starved Beast (I was told not to put the name of the bosses in thread titles which sounds fair enough)

I found this guy much easier than Father Gascoigne. Don't know why. Only took me 4 goes, Gascoigne took me a day and a half. 

BUT

I was then so busy celebrating my character died of poisoning :(

 I spent two months planning out my entire second novel. And now I'm writing it, about 5k words in, so not a considerable amount, I'm wondering how good the idea is, or perhaps I just don't have faith in my abilities to execute it.
How do you have faith in an idea? Or in yourself? I don't want to waste all this time on an idea that *I'm* not even sure is too good, never mind someone else. 




 Finally defeated Father Gascoigne. Even though he slaughtered countless times (I spent all day on it yesterday) that was still *such* a good fight. So few games get me feeling so tense, sitting up nose to the screen, got his beast form to a slim amount of health, and so *close*. Got him in the end. First time I tried today. Obviously just needed a break.

Now - back to shitting myself exploring previous unexplored territory.
 




 Always throws me off - stupid question, I know. Do you always start speech with a capital letter, even if the speech occurs mid-sentence?
For example: *'Whatever you're afraid of,' she said, 'nothing will hurt you.'* 
That second half, "nothing will hurt you". Capital or no capital? 




 So I read somewhere Kirkhammer was awesome. I don't mind wasting the 3k souls. But, it really doesn't seem that great. Sword is too weak, and hammer is too slow. Did I make a bad investment or should I give it a chance? 




 I have 3k souls that I am super hopeful I can get back to Hunter's Dream. Hopeful, I know. I can either level up (to 20. The gun is more expensive than level) or purchase the pistol. I have the blunderbuss and it would be nice to have a pistol for 1v1, and a blunderbuss for crowd control. Thoughts? 




 Am I right in thinking the Hunter Garb is better than the Yarnham Hunter Garb? That's what I'm going with. Advise me :( 




 And you howl wildly and beat your chest with your fist like you've just speared a woolly mammoth single-handedly.

Oh...just me? 




 Just fighting against him is one of the best gaming experiences I have ever experienced. One of the most frantic and equal and beautifully-paced fights I have ever come across. He may have kicked my ass twice now, but I am actually really ok to die against him. It means I get to go back and do it all over again.

That, Ladies   Gentlemen, is why this game is so, so amazing. 




 My intention is to write a blog post - or, more likely, a series of blog posts - focusing on writer's block. Breaking it down, understanding what causes it, and, ultimately, how to solve it - in as much as that is possible.
I can only rely on my own closed opinion of writer's block to formulate theories, and that won't do. So I'm looking to crowd source opinions and get as much information from as many people as possible.
In general, just tell me about your experiences, but I also want to know what you think it is, how you suffer from it, how often, how it affects your work, and what you do to get over it? 




 So, I assumed that I would get one level per insight. I got insight when I was defeated by the cleric boss, and got two Madman Insight's from the Sewers. My insight level is at 3, does it go down? Am I missing something? It seems like I only need one insight and could infinitely level up from it (providing Blood Echoes) 







































 No...How do? 









 Yeah, it's possible but probably not true. That's a vast conspiracy with nothing to gain from it.

 




 We're defined by our history? 




 I think that's where the thought comes from. We, as a country, are not patriotic. I think we display our patriotism by not being patriotic. Those of us who are more patriotic just moan about our country the least. But I don't like that I've lived somewhere for over 20 years and still can't pin down exactly what my identity, as a citizen of this country, is. What makes us different? And it feels like what does, or what did, make us difference is slowly being drained away. I understand all countries, thanks to the internet, are facing some form of homogenisation, and westernisation can't be disputed. But it's difficult to face that in, say, ten years, we'll be America 2, rather than England. 




 Because most of the documents I fill out (whenever I fill them out) ask me to put "White - British" or "Born in..." it's always Britain/British, so I say British.

English, then. What makes the English English. 




 I didn't no, we moved on after that I'm afraid. Next time I'll see her I'll ask. I should really have asked... 




 American Pyscho.

Eh...probably spoilers.

You know, I'm pretty ok with reading about torture. But I guess it was just so casual in this case. The rat and the cheese and the pipe (if you've read it - you know what I mean).

But what got me most was when he killed the dog. I think it's a human thing to dislike cruelty to animals (it's why dogs rarely, if ever, die in films). But Bateman killed that dog and his owner didn't even realise and when he did he was so upset. I mean - he didn't have long to be upset but still. I just went and gave my dog a big hug :( 




 That's an interesting take on it...Never heard that.  




 You're just saying we, as a nation, have become americanised. Which sadly so ridiculously true. I doubt if it had been so strong, I would have had to ask the question. As a culture we've pursued America, and except for our lack of talent when it comes to cuisine (because Beans on toast is perfect, why mess with what is excellent?), we're just a smaller America now. 




 The thing about the royal family is that the country that cares the least is England. We did a news segment in England about how much more news-coverage our own royal family got over seas. 

The thing about Top Gear is that it started here, the original is best ;)  




 It's easy to ask the question. Solving it is another matter. 




 Traditionalism is a good word for it. Probably the one I'd have used if I was smart enough to do so. 




 Are you saying we all just go around like peacocks? 




 I think my first reaction was to deny this, but...I fell into the trap. You're right, haha. 




 The thing about the possibility of life is you have to consider the countless billions of *tiny* things that came together to make life on earth possible. And then there's the big things. A planet colliding in earth, breaking off the crust which formed the moon and threw us onto our axis. If Saturn wasn't where it was we might have been wiped out by an asteroid millennia ago. And then there's the small things. Countless small things. Billions. The size of the earth. The distance from the sun. The amount of water on the earth. If any of these things were out by 5% life on Earth could not exist. 

Billions.

But then consider that there are *billions of* **galaxies** *each with* **trillions** *of stars and potential planets.*

The universe is simply too large, and there are too many things out there for life somewhere else to be *impossible*. I find the idea that the exact same conditions couldn't have been replicated ludicrous. There are enough galaxies for there to be thousands of earths, and millions of planets with alien-species nothing like humans, living on planets nothing like earth.

Yes there is life out there. It can't be any other way. 




 So I was talking to my friend, who is Romanian, and trying to decide what our cultural identity is as Brits, but we couldn't really decide. Other than bangers   mash and bathing in tea. 

So, if you're British, what do you think sets us apart from other countries?

If you're not British, what do you think sets us apart from your country, that you do differently to us? And not just the base stereotypes, we're not all goofy, monocled gents.  




 Sometimes perhaps it's best not to prioritise writing. Perhaps it's best to take a break from writing, take a step back and collect yourself and your thoughts. Just read, or watch something, just do something easy. Stick to your exercise, but if you find that writing is inducing more migraines, best not to push it. 

Of course if you do want to push it, and writing might make it better, I find goals don't help. Sensible goals or not, you don't always make them. I find it's best to just try and sit down, write for as long as you can until you've had enough, and be happy with whatever you've written. After all it's something, a paragraph is better than nothing. 

Like I say: Progress for its own sake. 




 Someone who *actually writes*, and writes consistently. 

It's true there are a lot of people who research and plan and they talk a lot about writing, and they imagine they are a writer, yet they get surprisingly little *actual writing* done. I've met people like that. 

You don't have to write well, or be published, or for anyone to read it. Just write consistently, whatever you can and whenever you can. I think that's all there is to it. 




 I got out of a long term (5 year) relationship a few months ago. It was a massive adjustment to lifestyle. 

I suppose you just gotta make it through the week. If you can postpone the official, end-all conversation till then, more's the better. Unless you just wanna get it over and done with, of course, which is understandable.

And people change, no doubt about that. I've got a lot of memories of my ex, we did a lot of things together (both our 18's and 21st, first-time holiday abroads, etc), but there's someone else out there who's worth more than that. I heard something once, which I hold on to; there's someone out there making memories right now that they will later share with you, when you're together. 




 Whatever Indie scene (game, movies) I really have never minded supporting it. I would feel happier paying your 25 or my 16 into the Indie world than into Hollywood. (Having said that, the AAA game industry is heading down hill).

I expect Cineworld do. There's a premium of about 2-3 extra for 3D and glasses purchase on top so that's a bit of a rip-off. But at least the more people who use cards, the more they *know* for certain they will take in each month. The cinema trade - another business I don't mind supporting. 




 I heard someone say on the internet before that love wasn't worth it, why would you want the pain? And the heartbreak? I said why wouldn't you? Why would you want to feel nothing? And go through life hollow? Why wouldn't you want to feel pain? I would rather feel pain than nothing at all.

Savour the end of a thing. Embrace that you're about to start a new chapter in your life, and - for better or worse - that's pretty exciting. Just remember that for all the pain, at least it's something, at least it's a drive to move you forward and keep you going. It's just about the fight. 

Pain makes life worth it. Not just because without it happiness is meaningless. But because it's separate, and it owns itself.  




 My parents have all their old books from when they were children. I have a tatty copy of Romeo + Juliet signed "To Tracy, [my mom] from Mom, 1976". That's pretty cool. 

A few of my Granddad's book are signed from my mom and my uncle from sometime in the 60's. That was pretty special. My mom (being the oldest) got handed down the books when he died last year. Most of them were signed as presents to him from when they were quite young.  




 I have the Cineworld card - I pay 16 a month, and then make sure I get my monies worth. At 9 a ticket, I only need to see two films to make that worth it. Which for me is no challenge.

The thing about where your money goes depends on where the movie came from. Let's accept the majority of movies come from Hollywood, and screw them - they're rich enough. Look at Indie films, or British films, and devise how much money goes to them. They tend to get limited releases, and odds are they paid a lot of money to get that film into cinema. 

Honestly, it's hard to say where the money goes. 




 I've grown up on consoles that's the only reason. It's what I am and maybe always will be used to. 

And thanks, I really want the game, damn my job!  




 "so it goes."

I got that tattooed on me. This book is brilliant, I don't need to tell you why because others have done that for me. However; watch John Green's crash course on the novel and re-read it. Whole new excellent perspective.  




 Crap laptop. And I prefer the controller, Kinect and achievement system of the Xbox. I'm a console person =D 




 I can, at times, be very impatient. I want things, I get them. Indie games have their place, and I appreciate them just as much, but at times I need a AAA game, and I want it immediately. 




 Xbone =] 




 ProjektRed, man. What bugs? ;) 




 Convincing myself that *The Witcher 3* isn't a priority, might push my will-power to the edge. 









 It's a small price to pay for the size and brilliance of the games we get.

Except in Bloodborne's case. Fuck those loading times. 




 I may have missed out on the days of the arcade games, but I'd happily swap that for Oculus Rift, Band Hero, Kinect and open-world exploring.

I respect the previous generation of games, and those that came after it. But I wouldn't trade in what we have, and where we're going (the technology) for anything. 




 Was meant to find out today if I'm losing my job or not. We were told on Monday some of us were being let go, so it's been a pretty shit week. Been trying to push to find out, and hoping the people in charge get off their asses and tell us. Our manager (who's job is also at risk) was pushing to find out today. He did find out, and they know which of us are being fired, but they won't tell us until Monday evening. And they forbade our manager from telling us too. Because bullshit. 




 I am swaying towards Keyes, I must say... 









 Crash Bandicoot, ofc. Spyro, the original Rayman, Space Jam for PS1 was killer. Croc for PS1. 

I only had a PS1 as a child.  




 My height =[

Being a short male is not the best. 




 Might I recommend a different way to edit? Go through it now just for grammar. Nothing big, just the odd run-on sentence, and a few misplaced comma's, small, grammatical errors that are nonetheless important. You want these things fresh in your mind to edit them, so they make sense how you want them.

After that, give it *at least* two weeks. More is better. You want to be as far away from the novel as possible for when you edit. And after that time, you'll be glad you cleaned up the grammar because it suddenly makes a *lot* more sense. Which is good because hopefully you've forgotten about most of the novel from your separation. 




 Yeah I heard about them eating their siblings in the womb. Always reminds of that king in Stardust who kills his siblings to gain the throne... 




 It doesn't surprise me in the least this exists. Thanks, this will entertain me for some time now =] 




 Romantic grotesques?  




 I'm not sure what the system is over there (being English) but it's worth looking into leaving the union if you don't want to be a part of it. Save yourself some money. Double check your contract - if they're taking money out, that isn't for the state, it should be stated in the contract. 




 Can you not opt out of the union? I've had a few jobs and never joined a union, but if there is one I'm always *offered* to join. They never just take money out of my pay for it. 




 I wonder what the statistic is for global pizza consumption. Someone needs to look into this... 




 British =] I've heard of Saran Wrap but only in passing. Not enough to say what it is. 




 How you finding Neverwhere? Read any of Gaiman before? 




 It's probably a touch more romantic to say the cathedral is decorated with 'gargoyles' rather than 'grotesques' though. Even though grotesques is a much better name. 




 Really, really disliked this book. 




 I'm not sure what Saran Wrap is...Is it cling film? It sounds like cling film... 




 That it, haha. 




 I'm still more scared of spiders though... 




 Heard that one before. Unsurprising. 




 Thanks, never too sure on the exact definition of a planet, or dwarf planet.

And what about when the moon frees itself of our orbit?  




 Praise be to him. 




 I always found it fascinating that a moon is simply anything that is within the pull of a planet's gravity. Pretty interesting to know our own moon isn't a moon. 




 Absolutely *anything!*  




 Search your brain (no googling!) for the most interesting and, possibly, mostly unknown fact you can come up with and drop it below! Then we can discuss it :D. 




 Just wander directly into the realm of fiction. Don't try and ground it in science. Create your own, entirely fictional, technology. Such as the Mass Effect gates, or the portals from the Portal game series, or the Halo Rings (Man...I play too many video games). If you're too worried about your book aging, go that way. 




 Harry Potter, of course. 




 Because there was only so many races. Men, Dwarves and Elves. 

As far as the rings of power go, the One Ring doesn't count. The others were created by Celebrimbor but the one ring wasn't. 

I expect Tolkien had a very specific reason, and it most likely died with him. 

Also; there was more than three races of elves. The rings were made before the Third Age, so before the obvious division of the Elves (Lorien - Galadriel. Mirkwood - Thranduil - and Elrond.) When the rings were made the houses of elves were crazy everywhere. There were 5 families of dwarves to begin with, and they remained the most popular. Durin (the line of Thorin in the film and book versions of the hobbit). And men had pretty much been devised into Numenor. Though that race was split into two. Sauron does gloat however that of the 9, 3 were Numenorean lords.

It might been a display of power. The Elves were the most powerful, and it would have been risky to control too many. This is less true for dwarves, and really not at all true for men. 




 Popping in for a cuppa with the queen.

But seriously there's nothing to do in London. 




 ;) isn't it the best song? 




 Thing's don't get sucked into black holes, they fall into them. (No, I don't quite understand the distinction but yeah...)

At the centre of every galaxy, including ours is a *super massive black hole*. That's why galaxies have such bright centres, stars are being pulled in. Of course, we can't see black holes, so how do we know there's one at the centre? There are stars that we can observe moving at impossible-to-fathom speeds, being flung around a single point. There's nothing that can move such a large, dense star, unless it is a super massive black hole. And the star is being slingshotted around it. 




 My only best friend is a little orange envelope :( I don't get to see him very often though. 




 Taken as a recommendation on Reddit. I love McEwan, but this might be unlike anything I've ever read before. But he is such a fantastically brilliant writer. 




 George Ezra.

*Oh, so he's only like 20. And he's white...well buggar me...* 




 That would so absolutely change everything. That's a really interesting concept - that pockets of the universe were different ages. And being as we can't totally explain gravity, it might not be wholly farfetched either. That would mean we could observe not only a different part of the universe, but a part of the universe different in time and perception to our own.

*And still before we find intelligent life!* 




 *Parts of the universe could be older than other parts!* 




 That's what makes it super fascinating  The jump between the Sloan Wall and the Hercules wall is massive. I doubt that even if scientists predicted something bigger, they wouldn't have jumped to 10 billion light years across. By our own understanding of the universe something so large ought to be impossible. Nothing that big could have grown in such a (relatively) short amount of time. Maybe there's pockets in the universe where things grow faster than in other areas. Or the universe is just vastly older than we thought it was. 




 25 - Entire works of Edgar Allan Poe.

20 - S (or Straka) by JJ Abrams and Doug Dorst.

18 - leather bound edition of *Aesops Fables*

18 - clothbound 2011 edition of *The Picture of Dorian Gray* 




 The Triceratops and T-Rex lived further apart than Humans and the T-Rex.

Cleopatra lived closer to time of the moon landing than the building of the great pyramids.

Recently (unless it was a hoax), a new *biggest-thing-in-the-universe has been discovered. Previously it was the *Sloan Great Wall* - a cluster of super galaxies stretching 1.2 billion light years across. (No, you cannot fathom how big that is). Recently, the Hercules borealis wall (or similar name) was discovered, a cluster of super galaxies measuring **10 billion light years across**. Why so significant? Because in a universe *supposedly* no older than 14 billion years old how can something have become so large? The discovery of something so big could totally change how perception of the age of the universe. 




 I spent a year editing my own novel, read through it and edited it more than ten times. I was pretty damn thorough. And it's vastly changed, almost all of it. And I like the beginning, and it works well. But when I get to reading the end the difference in style and how much of a better writer I am at the end is so noticeable. I don't notice a sudden change half-way through the novel, or anything like that. It's a smooth flow. I actually quite like seeing how I had grown over the three years it took to write. Like a growth chart.

I mean, the book is shit, but at least I have visible proof it made me a better writer. 




 So I was going to say something positive, but it was only what everyone else has said. So let me reinforce it, you sound like a great partner. Also, she seems to be doing pretty successfully, which is absolutely great to hear. You must be quite proud. 




 Kudos. Most I could do if one came so close and scream and run like a little a girl. If I was on a chair I would probably tilt backwards and floor myself. I would panic like hell. 




 I sense sarcasm but I feel like I do. 




 Crying with fear. Literally just had a panic attack. I need help. All I did was squish it with my shoe. 

But hey, I guess, when I can breath I might sleep now. Probably not. Terrified still. No idea why. 




 It's gone midnight and I'm sat waiting for a spider to appear to kill it. I can't sleep. Not well. 




 Yeah, moved back into my room. Hopefully it won't come back *back* to me. 




 Don't worry. I know the fear is absolutely irrational. I know it won't harm me in any way. I just detest them. 




 Can't. Stepdad is asleep in the next room and he's...let's just say he wouldn't take kindly to it. 




 It's on a new carpet, I can't squish it against that. Also, that involves being close enough to ensure the job is done properly. Or else allowing it to run away to god knows where - probably where I won't ever get it. 




 I'm not so sure...This one had shifty eyes, and eight of them... 




 Into my sister's room is it. 

It's not very small either. Thick and black and just sat there, on the floor. I had planned on trapping it under a bowl for the night, but couldn't even approach it to place said bowl. Far too risky. And I don't want to sleep in there with it either. So...here I am. If I hadn't stayed up *tonight* and tried to finish my book this wouldn't be a problem.

Christ, I hate spiders. Oh, my fear of them isn't normal. It surpasses plain phobia. I really, *really* need to see a doctor.


Edit: IT IS HERE. IT HAS FOLLOWED ME! IT HAS SMELT AND SEEKS MY FEAR!

It came out onto the landing. I stared at it for a while, watching it, as it circled around and came closer to my room. I threw a show at it to little effect, and when I tried to step on it, deciding to act rashly rather than further succumbing to fear, it ran away. I screamed as it ran off, hiding now in my sister's room where I won't follow it. I could cover the bottom of the door, securing it, but not without risking the thing running out whilst I do so. That would too close. Now I am shaking, sat here watching my sisters door for it to return so I can end this. It is 12:30PM. I have work at 9. I am shaking from fear. I won't sleep with it still alive. 




 You could ask me, I'd be interested in a decent project.

I might PM you. 




 That does sound good. I've added it to a list on Goodreads of all the books I need to buy. Unfortunately I bought six books last week, and that on top of the more than ten I already own but haven't read. So I suppose I won't be buying it just yet. haha. I have book-buying issues. 




 Like I said; not as elite is it perhaps ought to be. 




 *The Amber Spyglass, by Philip Pullman*

*The Virgin Suicides, by Jeffrey Eugenides*

*On Chesil Beach, by Ian McEwan*

and, *The Ocean at the End of the Lane, by Neil (The God) Gaiman*

Fairly varied. And there are books that have come close. *Slaughterhouse-5*, (I have a quote tattooed on me). *The Kingkiller Chronicles.* And *1984*, amongst others. 




 Not sure about changes to the current one but I can help you with the next... 




 Well if you're interested in having someone write, or edit/proofread I would be super happy to help. If you're looking for someone... 




 Friendly advice: stahp! Just write! 




 Being sick makes you exempt from needing to be productive. 




 Get both =] 




 That's always helpful, so long as know what words to put down. That's the important bit. The writing. 




 Yeah I was at that stage.

*I'll never make 30k words....I'll never make 60k...80k...100k...Damn this never ends!* (Finished at 125k).

But 85k in 5 months is bloody stellar. Took my three years to write mine. 




 We'll be masters of VR and hover-boards. 




 You certainly aren't the only one, but that doesn't make it any smarter. You'll never finish anything this way. Finishing and then perfecting is how it ought to be done. Rather than perfecting on the way - as you write.

Sure you'll have a perfect sentence. But that is all you will have. A sentence. 




 My grandma's much the same. I wouldn't have any hope to actually get her to play a game. Neat thought though. 




 Man if I could get my Grandma to play some games with me I would be all over that. That would be interesting. 

Good day so far for you, no complaints =] 




 Took the place of favouritest ever novel alongside two or three others. It's not as elite a group as I'd like haha.

Gaiman is my favourite author. He is a god. 




 That's all it takes =] 




 I woke up this morning thinking *"Right, time to kill of my 7-year old sister,"* and when I read what I had wrote about her that hit me. 

The best line I've ever written is six words, and hits me everytime I read it. (It's the very last line in my novel, no you can't read it :D).

But someone said "No surprise to the writer, no surprise to the reader. No tears from the author, no tears from the reader." What you feel, the harder bits to write, put that into your writing, emote, and it will make it all the better. Part of being a writer is utilising that. If you feel for your characters, the audience will. If you don't care about your characters, how can you ask an audience to? 

Now go get your ass in gear! If you want to talk to me, I'm just an orange-envelope away =] 




 I found that writing a short story in the same universe as my own novel was a huge help. Almost to the point where parts of my book *couldn't* exist without it. It was vital. 

If you're struggling to write, write a short story, then if you drop it, it doesn't matter so much. You can evaluate your strengths and weaknesses, and get a feel for your world. 

Writing is just that. Writing. It's enduring the worst day and sitting your ass down and writing. It's realising that inspiration and motivation are entirely *useless*. You will never be inspired or motivated to write, but you just gotta do it. There's nothing more to it. Sitting down and let the words flow.  




 I agree with all of that. But for the actual creative part, the fun part of coming up with new things, and not knowing exactly where my characters will go, or how I'll write it, what I'll come up with, I love that. That's just the appreciation of literature. But, of course, it is all terrible without editing.

I edited my own novel for a year. That included removing 18k words and reading it over more than ten times. Three times out loud in its entirety. That sure as hell put me off editing.

This guy's a start. He's one of the biggest I've seen. Following links from his channel will set you on the right path to discovering lots of other book vloggers as well.

Of course there's no guarantee they'll do you a favour, but where's the harm in trying? 




 I would recommend whatever works for you.

I find that whenever I'm not particularly in the mood to write I just sit down. And three sentences in I'm lost. People always complain about writer's block without even trying to do anything about it. Just sit down and write and once you've got a little bit down you'll get lost in the story, and then that's it, you're writing. 

If you're only writing novella's there's no pressure to write a lot at all because it won't take as long to finish. If you feel happier just sitting down writing no more than 300 words, that's fine. If you want to write one hundred, and take a break and write another hundred, do so. If you sit down for a while and stop and realising your approaching 1k, I wouldn't be surprised, but that's great. Do whatever is easiest. If you want to try for a larger amount, but can't reach it, be happy with whatever you've done. And strive for a little less tomorrow. Or push your damn hardest to reach your word-goal. 




 So far, so good! The art style is fantastic.

Please tell me you're looking for a writer to work with you on the project!

(Why are you an egg being held in someone's hand?) 




 Sitting down and actually writing is what it's all about. Thinking about a thing is easy, writing is hard. Though it's super good to get ahead on the basis of the story. Nothing will come of it without those ever-so vital words. 




 Personally not a MOBA fan, but wahoo to higher productivity than normal! =D 




 I like to write every day. Not always possible. But I try. And if I do sometimes it's only 300-500 words. A paragraph. But that's why 1500 words is so important. You can get that in one day, or write little bits every day and still get it done.

We're the opposite. I dislike editing. I like actually writing. Editing is just painful and tedious. 

 




 Sounds like you did a lot of nice things for your mom. Pretty productive already, done quite a lot in a fairly short time - always a bonus! =] 
























 I'm super excited for final book, as well. But haven't heard anything.

However, on the [Amazon](http://www.amazon.co.uk/City-Mirrors-Justin-Cronin/dp/0752897896/ref=sr_1_1?s=books ie=UTF8 qid=1434363208 sr=1-1 keywords=city+of+mirrors) page for it, they seem to be standing on December 31st 2016 release date.

 Have to jump in and say how *vastly* superior *Morrowind* was to *Oblivion*. Morrowind was so, so good. Highly recommend. 




 thx 









 Yeah I think your right about that. I just don't think Bane was any kind of follow-up to the Joker. If Bane had come first it might have been a different story, the problem was that he had to follow Ledger's Joker. Nolan dug himself a hole with such a brilliant villain, and a great film. There was no way the third film could have competed against it.

Having said that TDKR is by all standards a decent film. And you have to respect the shit out of Nolan for actually ripping a plane to pieces, rather then hollywood-ising it and using CG. The rest of the film could have been shit (it wouldn't) but that remains one of the best opening scenes to a film ever. 




 For the masterpiece that was *The Dark Knight*?! Everyone needs to make time! :D 




 Thinking of buying a game at half price (Civ 5). Is there a guarantee the price won't drop at a later day in the sale?  




 Damn is it that time of year again. What a terrible time to lose my job :( 




 You watch the sequel? The Dark Knight Rises. Would be interested to see what you thought about that.

What compelled you into rewatching it? 




 It's hard to say without reading the previous Sapkowski novels, or playing the original 2 TES games. 3 if you never played Morrowind. 

Morrowind was an entire construction in it's own. They wrote novel after novel of information for that game, just to create backstory. The world has been growing since the very first TES game 'Arena'. For contemporary players - who perhaps joined at Oblivion, or even Skyrim, there might not be a lot to offer. 

Equally, people who only joined the game at The Wild Hunt might miss out on a lot of the world only gleamed through either the original novels, or the first two games. 

I think what settles this is where they came from. TES was never meant to be more than a game. The aim of its construction was, above all, to make a game that was as enjoyable as possible. It was built on the idea of *there's a goblin, here's a pointy thing.' And the world has been growing ever since.

Unfortunately, due to the polish origins (I don't speak Polish) and the fact I joined TES shortly after Morrowind's release, and the Witcher during the seconds 360 release, I don't know as much about The Witcher's backstory. However the depth of the world can be seen as thus; one is aimed at gamers. At the time of Arena's release this was a bunch of teenage boys. The Witcher however aimed immediately at a more adult market, went into the world darker and with a more likeable protagonist. (The world only shines as bright as it's protagonists). 

So if you want to compare each world as a whole, the political intrigue, character division, and depth of the beasts lends The Witcher strong marks. TES draws far too heavily on medieval England, and populates its world fairly predictably. I would have to go with The Witcher.

However if you were implying to only question the *game* worlds of Skyrim vs The Witcher continent as seen through their flagship games - you would have to go Witcher also. This is however an unfair question given the years between releases. 

Skyrim set out to do something fantastic, and it did. It remains one of the best fantasy RPG games of all time. It might still hold the mantle (DA:Inquisition turning into something of a colossal disappointment). And Wild Hunt has the technology (and brilliant studio) behind it to really push the boundaries of what they can do. The world is more alive and aesthetically stunning. Skyrim I felt was better to explore - you were more likely to come across something you wouldn't expect to. Whereas in the Witcher - Geralt's entire mode of life is to find and kill monsters, which takes a sheen off finding and killing monsters when you approach it with a calculated, almost contrived mindset. 

Having said that, I would much rather explore the world of The Witcher - not just for it's aesthetics, but for the people, the fantastic monsters, the quests that are more than just 'kill, x 10' (though those do exist).

So yeah, I didn't expect this to be so one-sided when I set out. I though I would back TES far more than this, but, hands down, The Witcher.

Having said that, let's see what Fallout 4 produces. Which will give us a neat idea of what the next installment in TES will be. Bethesda are one of the best studios going and I trust what they produce to be excellent.

Edit: Grammar 




 I'm sorry, I read the whole post but am still blindsided by the title.

This is only your second viewing. *Since 2008?*  




 Inside Out will change that! 




 Same as Cars 2. Though MU was better. Brave was a bit...naff also. 




 I loved MU too, I'm just not sure how well it fed into the first one. Or compared to it. 

 




 Up, man. UP is Pixar's best. Though they really do make some of the unparalleled best films of all time. 

I trust implicitly that Inside Out will be excellent. 




 I was a little bit later when Toy Story came out. 

But when Pixar surged - The Incredibles, Finding Nemo, Monsters Inc, they were amazing.  




 The old Disney days were awesome.

But Disney cant compare to Pixar - not even a little bit.

UP. UP is just amazing.

But even that isn't as good as *How to Train Your Dragon 2*.

Favouritest bestest ever kids film. 




 I was pretty happy with my first rejection. It wasn't as if I had been expecting anything else. I wasn't disappointed (around the fourth that came in - then it got worse). It felt to me like I had done something. Taken a step towards my dream. Proved that I was capable of putting myself out there. 

It also meant another 6 months of editing but, hey, what ya gonna do?

Congrats is all I can say =] 




 Support for the previous consoles hasn't died out, or for PC. Why not get Fallout 3? And try it. It'll give you the best insight into whether or not you'll like Fallout 4. The stories won't interact, so no worries there, but you'll get a feel for the world and gameplay.

New Vegas wasn't made by Bethesda - but FO3 and FO4 are. Just to bear in mind. 




 It was a werewolf flick, but I didn't really have anything to write. I gave up.  




 Know what I'm doing tomorrow =] 




 Night, sleep well, stranger =] 




 :(

:((

:(((

(x3 sad, not double and triple chin - would perhaps looks like that if I ate them shortbreads though ;).)

Looking good, thanks for the sharing dem cooking skills =] 




 The thing about the niche is that right now it isn't niche enough, and I need to dig deeper. I'm happy to dive in as is (so long as my friend comes aboard), but I understand it might go a bit better with a bit more planning.  




 Not burnt yet, and looking **delicious**.

...

hungry 




 Half of convincing my friend is encouraging them to stick through the initial slow-phase. The first few months of barrenness, and hoping it pays off. 

I have an interesting niche in mind, but I'm not too sure how well it will work out. Just because it's YT, and there's a lot of stuff out there, and hundreds of people trying to *make it*. 

But thanks for the advice, I appreciate it. Anything advice right now is useful. 




 Never heard of that show. Sounds a bit Twilight Zone-y. 

Green tea is a sin. Any tea but normal tea is a sin against tea, and the British. Power to Tea! I just love tea. If I'm feeling particularly withdrawn from tea, and finally get a drink, I do love it in my stomach, all warm and snuggly =]

I've given up on the story now. Was just trying to write for the sake of it. I failed. 




 Share a picture when they're done. I want to see that delicious biscuity-goodness :D 




 *-wishes he could now eat shortbread.-* Thanks for taking time out of your baking to share with me, and make me crave shortbread biscuits whilst I'm all tucked up and cozy in bed. 




 The worst of it? We don't know why we actually need to sleep. We just do! Just 'cause. No reason we know of. Yep, wasting 1/3 of our day, every day. I dislike. 




 Gaming. Within the 'Lets Play' vein of videos. But with potential to break out into more versatile areas. 




 It's a matter of convincing my friend to put in the time and effort. Especially the beginning few months where, on the more exciting videos, we might break 100 views.  




 I'm doing quite well, thanks for asking. Starting to get a bit tired, now, but I can go on a bit longer. 




 Coming along then. Getting there, slowly. I always say a project is serious (or "Main") when it reaches 20k. 




 Interesting concept. What's the word count on it now? 




 I usually find myself like this. Happier to stay awake ridiculously late and have a decent lie-in in the morning. I'm more awake and more active this time of the evening/night.

What anime? How's your tea? (Tea: nectar of the gods). I'm working slowly on a story, but not a very good one. 




 Sounds like a good day. What was the project? 




 Three novels, hey? Interesting way to do it. Nothing wrong with a break, but what are your novel's about?

Yeah I'm a writer, I get interested in and like talking to other writers about the craft. 




 So long as you enjoy it, that's what it's all about.

Ever written anything longer? A novel? Am I distracting you now? Are you procrastinating, haha. 




 It's a good thing you wrote it in that order. Because even though it started out rough it's turning around and starting to work out in your favour. There's not a lot you can do right now except enjoy all the free-time you've suddenly got as a single man. That's what I did when I became single. Found new hobbies, read more, just spent more time to myself, and it was great. 




 We hiked through the Cairngorms and up the mountain. Visited more castles (and subsequently learned a shitload of Scottish history) than I thought possible to do in one week. And I also climbed Ben Nevis. So...yeah...been to the highest point in the UK. Whoo =] 




 I'm just sitting here thinking of my own ideas like - *damn, that's a good idea...my ideas are shit...*

I'm sure the mods won't, hopefully I won't miss it.  




 Sounds like a more exciting Wednesday evening than the one I'm having. 




 I like to keep myself going on here, never be wholly absent. Try and have a thread going now and then, so I'm not *just* lurking. I wanted to know what was happening on the internet and reddit - on the other hand, some damn beautiful views in Scotland. 




 Sounds like a fun challenge, albeit difficult. Good luck getting all those done.

Also...interesting concept. Does the reader know from the beginning he's going to visit his own grave? Or is that the twist?

If you remember me, show me the collection for free on Kindle I wouldn't mind taking a peek =] 




 Sounds awesome. Just kicking back, enjoying not having to sleep? 




 Reddit altogether. I went on a week-and-a-half hiking holiday to Scotland. Was pretty much away from the internet. And most technology (except phone and car). A week away from Reddit - it was hard, man. 




 What's kept you up so late? 




 A writer! What's the short about? Plan on doing anything with it? 




 I stay the hell away from creepy stuff. I watched the new 'Evil Dead', and my girlfriend succesfully bribed to watch 'Sinister' with her in cinema (for *Dishonored* - which was totally worth it). And yeah...I did not sleep for weeks after each one. Every time I stumble across something I think might be creepy I just turn it off - it's not worth it.

I'm good at the moment, just feeling alive, like I want to do something. So I thought I'd catch up with CC as I haven't been on in a while =] 




 A little undeveloped at the moment. Need to work on it, make it more watchable, try and evaluate if it would actually work. See if my friend - who I have ran the idea past - is as interested as they seem, or if they were just humouring me... 




 Gaming videos. Don't worry, I know a million of those exist already but I have my own little niche to bring to it.  




 Sounds good to me. 




 Anyone else ever just in the mood to stay up all night for the sake of it, yeah, I'm currently going through that. 

Current thought: I'm currently trying to devise a way to make money. A youtube channel is a good idea - but I need to convince my friend to do it with me, hmm.

Anyway, how are you? 




 Me and my then girlfriend were playing it. So got lost in the castle and our lantern went out. I gave up then.
 




 I don't know a single person who wouldn't take those odds. Ok, a few, perhaps. But being able to *choose* to fly, or run super-fast, etc. Who wouldn't? 




 Well, it wouldn't be surgerical. It's a hypothetical; the procedure takes place in whatever way you're comfortable with :).  




 Couple'a months... at the most.  




 So a question I came up with, that I like to ask people:

You have the choice to undergo a procedure to get superpowers. The chances of it working are slim, and, if it doesn't, you'll die horribly and slowly of radiation poisoning. So - is it worth the risk?

1) You don't get to choose the superpower. It could be anything. It could be great (super speeds, flying) it could be crap, like controlling cheese or something.


2) You can't kill yourself if the procedure fails. You have to suffer. That's the point.

Dying a slow and horrible death worth even the slightest possibility of gaining superpowers? Let me know. 




 I think I read a lot. Probably went a film-binge. Kept an eye on my emails, kept refreshing every 5 minutes. 

And, of course, got very, very drunk.  




 AH! This is so true. This book was so much more amazing than I thought. It truly is exceptional. Easily one of the best books I have ever read. 




 Just finished *Flowers for Algernon*, by Keyes. And just started *Smoke and Mirrors*, by Gaiman. 




 [Following this thread] 




 Promising review. 

How does the combat go? Feel? Is it unique or same as all the other MMO's? What are the classes like? 




 Let me know when you've given it a chance. I've sorta kept an eye on it, enough to hear it was almost definitely going F2P (and it did), but I've played enough MMO's to be skeptical. 




 How is it? Any good? Might give it a try. 




 I've read about it just, and what I've read isn't comforting. So I know it's not just me. It's a save game bug, where I can't save the game manually. When I jumped into the game this morning there were frame-rate issues, especially bad during combat, so I wanted to save and quit and reload and hope that worked. But now I'm scared to quit unless the game throws me back a few hours. Every solution to the issue seems to risk losing my entire save file and the hours I've put into the game already.

Anybody else ran into this issue? Apparently it's not just affecting the Xbone but PS4 and PC as well - though the PC fix seems easier and more likely to not mess up the game.

I mean, otherwise a really excellent game. Cheer me up, gamers =[ 




 Kvothe is one of, if not the, most compelling characters I've ever read. You haven't met Ambrose yet but when you do, you'll loathe him just because Kvothe does. When Kvothe doesn't succeed, I've never felt so bad for any character, nor wanted one to succeed just so much. Rothfuss does a brilliant job of making you sympathise with Kvothe on a really human level. And that is excellent.

But yeah, mostly he is an utter badass. 




 I cannot recommend you finish TNotW and TWMF ASAP! Two of the best books I've ever read. And I still really want to get round to the The Dresden Files but my backlog is heavy enough as it is. 

But yeah, de-prioritise everything else, read TKKC. That's my advice. 




 I didn't watch that one tbh. Too busy playing the Witcher. But the channel is really interesting. The first half of the video - which I watched - was really good. Check it out: [Clickity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNuQZPTHALI) 




 Not doing any reading? Throw in some reading there =] 




 [My life isn't very interesting](http://imgur.com/nnxXHrj) 




 Trying super hard to be objective. Why didn't you like it.

I also point out that I personally think Ocean is his best, some people prefer American Gods, others prefer Neverwhere.q 




 I wasn't implying to start using Unity, just they have a better community over there. I think earning attaining skills is the best way to go, just speaking from my own experiences trying to find a way into the industry. 




 Because I couldn't find the others. Don't want to join in on a dead thread. Start my own and cover new ground, rather than trek old ones. 




 There's enough to be going on with online. I know you want to work in UE but if you're working with one of the C's, of Java, the community over on the Unity site are super helpful. There are other programming sites, and even Reddit should be able to help with any niggling questions. If you push at it hard enough you can teach yourself to program.

What kind of design do you mean? 




 Biggest hurdle will be not having anything to offer.

Can you design, or draw or program? Perhaps an internship is the best way to go. The industry is so damn saturated these days that you need to be above the best to even be considered. 

UE4 is a great way to go, and learning on your own is rewarding. But difficult. Ridiculously difficult. I tried it. Programming is hard, and modelling is hard, and GUI and sprites and textures are hard.

It's a lengthy process but one of the most rewarding you'll ever do. Just gotta stick at it. 




 Ah, got it. Listening to it now thankyou.

I thought it was a BBC radio thing. Sounds awesome. 




 This game, though excellent, takes on a whole new perspective, and reaches unseen emotional heights, upon completion. You simply have to finish it. I just...the game - the story - isn't the same without the ending. It needs it. 




 To me his emotional growth was spearheaded by the *other charlie*, and that his own emotional growth was subdued, especially compared to his intellectual growth, by his traumatic childhood experiences. His emotional growth wouldn't have been so impeded were it not for his childhood trauma, and how it came to him so slowly, piece by piece so he could never come to terms with it in one go. That kept his emotional level at that of a child, far more than his intellectual growth. Emotionally he was at the point where he could sleep with Fay, but due to *other Charlie*, he couldn't sleep with Alice. 

I read the last fourty of thirty pages in one go, so I got pretty much the events leading up to his decline, and the decline itself in one go. When his sentences fell apart, and his spelling decline, that when it really hit me. Harder I thought than it was going to, because everyone saw that coming. It was just before the decline when he said he could never go back to being, as he put it, retarded. And then during his decline he said was much happier in his current state, that was what got me. 




 Where can I find it? 




 Hey, I didn't read the whole post because...spoilers. I just wanted to ask. How good was the audiobook? Cumberbatch a decent narrator? How long is it? I'm not overly fond of audiobooks, but I would make an exception. 

Thanks in advance, I've wanted to get round to this for ages, and this is a really good excuse for me to do so. 




 I felt a good takeaway from the book was actually about introversion. For a book about a super-genius it was about 100% more existential than I thought it would be. 

But yeah, particularly towards the end the book took a pretty dark turn, and it did bottle-neck the message into: stay stupid; stay happy. 

But the book was really only about Charlie, I didn't perceive it as an allegory for anything, I never read through it thinking there was a message it was trying to get across. It was a ride, and a good one. 




 I studied Media for five years, I have a degree in it. And damn didn't I spend four of those five years wishing I had studied gaming.

Kudos to you, I say. *Do something you love and you'll never work a day in your life.* 

How are you breaking into the industry? Are you just venturing out on your own making indie games? Or looking to break into a large studio? 




 You don't. You get to know them better. Then you're not uncomfortable anymore; you know them.
 




 Ya know I see a lot of these on CC. It always cheers me up seeing something like this and just knowing that a stranger, at least as far as I know, is doing well in life. That might be weird, but it's more cheerful than seeing the news. I just know that if I pop over to CC I will see at least 80% of the threads are cheerful and life-affirming. And the 20% that aren't, anyone who reads them almost always comments something positive. 

Thanks stranger, I'm happy your life is working out :) 




 It did seem to be a central theme that intelligence generally equaled unhappiness. Which was super-important in Charlie's case. I went in expecting it to kinda praise intelligence but it really didn't. I guess that's one of the reasons the book is so good. 




 I know there's been a lot of threads about this book, but I've avoided them for spoilers. Now I've finished it I want to hear what you thought of it.


**Spoilers will follow**

 




 First of all watch the film.

Second of all watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98j1Sb97usg). It will be a major help in understanding parts of the book. But it is spoiler-ific, which is why I recommend the film first. 

Once you've seen both I think then you'll be able to appreciate the book. I watched that YT video *after* I had read the book, and everything really just fell into place, with regards to the book. So I think it's worth watching first. 









 No. Only one. Christopher Nolan. 




 He just is. Perfect in every way. He doesn't make mistakes. He is the best.  




 All hail our lord and cinematic saviour Christopher Nolan. He is a god. 




 THis is absolutely beautiful. I'm super exciting, but ya know what annoys me? And The Witcher isn't the only culprit. 

It really annoys me when you get the game case *and a steelbook!* I mean, *of course* I want to use the steelbook but *the hell am I gunna do with this wasted *normal* *case?* Now I just have a spare case for the shits and giggles, damnit!

Didn't know it came with a cloth map though, very nice touch. 




 Awesome work. Very nice and effective.

Still annoyed they changed the acronym. I mean - talk about doing something just for the sake of it! 




 Got me as well, at first. Boy did I feel silly when Morgenstern wasn't real. 




 Witcher 3 




 What role were you doing?  




 Maybe The Last of Us. But, if I remember correctly, Far Cry 3's *Blood Dragon* was pretty good. It might just have been that the ending to that game was probably the best of any game I've played, really. 




 It's 10:40 AM in the morning and I woke up not so long ago. Chilling in bed reading. 




 American Gods is absolutely amazing. Of course it's not as good as The Ocean at the End of the Lane - which is his best. His short stories are also well worth a read. He has three collections and they are all brilliant. 




 Your friend just needs to stretch his gaming muscle.  




 Good bit of broth there =]

Hmm, Olive and Whale Blubber Broth. Dinner of kings. 

So if I ever get this game I will scour every coast for a beached whale now, to discover if this was a chance incident in your game, or implemented into every single one. Just how much can CDProjektRed impress me? 




 Ooh, do me. Do me! 




 Depends if you want to live-stream it via twitch or make a let's play YT channel.

As far as live-streaming go, there's really no reason not to stream live from the Xbone, it cuts out the middle-man (PC) and is just nifty and a lot more stream-lined, with faster streaming speeds, which means higher quality.

Capturing it is another story. There really isn't any way to do it other than with a capture card (heretofore called CC). CC's can cost a fair bit of money, but you do, of course, get what you pay for. Like I said mine was 100 but is one of the best on the market. Especially for the new generation, like the Xbox one. 

If you give me an idea of the kind of format you're going for - what you plan on doing. I can give you an idea of the best way to do it, if that helps. 

If I'd have stuck with it however my plan would have been to stream and LP both. Stream games that are more drop-in-drop-out. Games on COD, silly run-throughs, shorter, possibly indie, games. And then do YT LP's of the more serious plays, the story driven games, or the longer ones. I suppose the plan was to create a larger fan base, and, of course, play as many games as possible, and get the most from each one. 




 How's that 1 olive working out for you? :D 




 Live streaming from PC? *OBS*. Easy to use and connects straight to Twitch account. There is also *Xsplit* but that isn't as recommended. 

Of course Steam has its own streaming now, so you can use that.

From consoles? The new generation (Xbone, PS4) have twitch apps you can download and stream straight from console, all you need is internet and a mic. Kinect can also be used as a cam if you want (I assume PS Move can too). 

From older consoles? You might need a capture card. I own the *Game Capture HD*. The card itself cost me 100 quid, but the program to stream is free. Comes with all the necessary cables and works with every console I've tried it on, which is everything but the Wii U (though it does have issues with PS3). Also, it should work fine with the Wii U, I just haven't tested that one out yet. There are cheaper alternatives. 

Ah...I think that's everything covered. 

Of course then it comes down to production values. I have used a Guitar Hero Mic plugged into my laptop, and that worked fine, better than the built in one. But if you want to look pretty, I recommend a decent webcam and mic. They can be somewhat cheap, depends what you want. 

Editing is also super easy these days. But if you, again, want the professional sheen I recommend Final Cut Express. It's pretty much iMovie or Windows Movie Maker but a bit hyped up. It's approaching professionalism. A little bit more pristine is Final Cut X, but that'll set you back more than a bit. iMovie and WMM do the job fine, and to start out with, they're perfect.

As for content; that's down to you. There are plenty of guides out there. 




 Ooh that is painful too :( I feel for you, broken TV is not cool. 




 We can be sad together. 




 Yeah, I just ain't that good, m'afraid. I write for games though. Mind you, not a lot of money in that so far. 




 Man, that could be weeks. I was all set to pick it up tomorrow. 
























 Thanks. It's always nice to hear how anything i've written affects someone else so this was good to read. Thanks =] 




 Northern Lights by Philip Pullman, that one? 




 Don't have any examples I could see do you? 




 Thanks =] 




 Things didn't turn out as planned.

That's an understatement.

It makes me feel sick to the stomach,

and I can only just see it from your point.

But see it from mine!

If you were in love with someone else

You wouldn't give me a second though,

Wouldn't think to care how I feel...

But it was me you loved, me

You left someone else for.

I could call you a fool,

Say it was your fault,

That you shoulder the blame.

*

But Ive always been a realist:

This is my burden, and my fault.

Fuck the lessons, we dont want to be kids anymore.

But thats out of our hands, and so that's what we are: kids.

Prone to mistakes, slaves to feelings.

Greedy, malicious.



I should have seen this from the beginning.

Should have known how it would turn out.

Should have predicted the tears.

But I couldn't care for your heart,

because I don't have mine:

When you're in love that's what you give away.

*

I won't make excuses, you deserve more than my childish 
cowardice,

Trying to worm my way out of it, with no where to run.

I told you what I was like, you chose not to believe me.

Unintentionally I taught you the hard way what I was truly like.

And now I've lost myself trying to see myself for what I truly am.

Nothing, nothing.

That's what you would have seen me as.

*

I meant every kiss  if it's any condolence,

If you can believe, for even a second, anything that comes from 
my mouth,

Kiss or words. But I'll leave it up to you to decipher true from 
false.

Though I deserve nothing but your hatred.

And if it means anything, yes, shivers swept down my spine the 
first time we kissed,

And I enjoyed the moments that we shared.

But I couldn't keep it up,

Because somehow she got back into my head,

into my heart.

And I want you to know if I could have chosen, 

I would have thought things through, and, for now, I would have 
picked you.

*

I want to end this poem saying

I'm in love,

but not with you.

And it doesnt matter, as hard as you wish,

It's not you, and it never was.

I always loved her, I always will.

Neither of us will get what we want, 

thats the way it's going to be.

 My dreams are fire.

And, Oh, how I have

dreamt.    



And the rage, and the passion, and the

Heat, and tongues of that fire

Had licked my conscious desire;

And I knew that in that one, tiny

Infinitesimal, minute moment

I could be more than this.

And yet.

And yet.

Oh, but still

That it were possible to be all 

My dreams

Have foreseen.

And not this, 

Hollow,

Impassioned being

Of caged-fire

And dewy eyed 

Desire.

 So, we are meeting again.
You. You who still haunt my

Every waking hour

To you I am to blame

For this shell I call home.

For whom I blame for this neglect, destitution.  



I am a man.

I am a boy.

I am a human.

I am everything you

Should have known

You would leave me as.

You who are so bitter,

So spiteful. You who would

Break skin for the malevolence,

For the colour: blood.

And unto me you left this

Learners scar, 

So you could be a poet.  



I am a poet,

You are a fool,

You are a child, you are

The neglectful little 

malignance that is the 

abode of my every whim.

You are the little malicious 

Greed that left me to thirst

As you fed this fire.

This pen wouldnt fit so 

Perfectly

In my teeth if you hadnt

Shown me how to hold it.  



You are not a man,

You are not a boy,

You do not consider yourself human.

You are an object,

Arent you?

And how I hate you,

I hate

I do not hate those scars

On your arm,

Not so much as

Your fathers disappointment,

But a lesson you taught

Yourself

Well.

How alive we are.

Just you and me.

I am the form you wish you had,

But having said that

There will be more poems

To come.

 Love the poem, excellent imagery.

But I feel it would benefit from punctuation. That is really my own opinion, and discard if you wish. But for me the poem is slow, it's thought out, and it reads meticulously, it rewards the slow reader. But without punctuation there's no pace, or style, it's just one solid read through. No chance to break, and consider, or think about what's been wrote.

Just my two cents. 




 Really love this poem - as does everyone else.

My only issue is the second line of the fourth stanza, 'I already care' doesn't feel smooth. And the rest of the poem is super smooth, it reads really nice. All except that one line, which feels a bit hemmed in. 




 Interesting start to the poem. I love it! :D

Feedback: I get that you're repeating yourself, reinforcing that the recipient is a 'cunt'. But the repetitions doesn't read well with only a comma. Try placing a full stop there. It rounds off the first 'cunt', and reads easier for the second one. Equally keep the comma, and remove the second 'you're', but I think it reads better with a full stop, as it is.

Third line: That rhyme, it's distracting, because it's the first rhyme in the poem (pretty much the only one). It feels a touch forced, and very much out of place. I get what you're trying to say, and, this is my own personal input, I didn't like it, it felt wrong. Perhaps try rewording it, find another word for defeat?

Fourth line: Touch of interpretation here. Does the person come back shrouded in' love you never going to know?'. Or is it a separate line, a second taunt. Might need breaking up, or the meaning you want (conjoined, separate) made clearer. Love the line after that.

A lot of comma's in the sentence after that. Which reads fine, it's not a fast poem. It's mostly when it comes out of 'year' into 'sitting contempt'. The whole line might need tweaking, it reads fine without any comma's between weeks, months, year, but I see what you're going for with all of those comma's. Here's an idea, try separating the list with dashes;

 and share in the revelry, but tonight - as in the past weeks, and months, and year - I sit in contempt of love lost...

Reads a touch smoother, but doesn't detract. Even if you don't take on board that idea, I think there's still something there that needs doing.

Great poem. Perfectly angsty, eye-catching beginning, and it doesn't wane for a second. Excellent final line, really homes in what the entire poem is about, and makes it count; a perfect ending. 




 I always purchase faster than I read. I have a back-log of about 15 books.

How did you find: John dies at the end? Paper Towns? And, The Maze Runner?

Those are the only ones I've read. 




 A poem about night terrors? Most awesome! Wonderfully captured, I might add. 

Start: amazing, the alliteration really draws you in, rolls off the tongue, easy to read. Perfect. (Missed capital on 'Your'). 

Not sure what that dash is for between 'you are sure - has been bestowed'. I found it kinda distracting. It reads fine without it, and I don't feel the need for it in the least. 

That first sentence, second stanza, is pretty long, a real mouthful. Perhaps put a full-stop after 'bestowed' and remove the 'as'.

has been bestowed. You resiliently calculate the servitude of the coming episode.

Works really with the 2nd person theme, as well.

At the end of the second stanza you switch from past to present tense in the last section;

where an ugly face it showed, an even uglier grin it bares. 

This is fine if you want to say that in the nightmare it showed an ugly face, but awake an 'uglier grin it bares'. However as it reads it feels like the same, descriptive sentence, that switches tense.

Air capture? Interesting phrase. Respiration, perhaps? 

This section: *'each of your ex and inhales'*. I read 'ex' as something different, and got confused, I had to go back and then I realised you meant exhale and inhale. Easy solution, bring them together: *'ex-and-inhales'*. Makes it read faster too, which keeps up the pace, and makes it more obvious that floaty 'ex' is joined.

Third stanza: you've got a comma, a single word, and a semi-colon and I can't quite get my head around you want it to be read. The comma speeds up the pace, it could easily be a full-stop but isn't, so; read faster. But the semi-colon immediately slows it right down. Read through that sentence, get a feel for the pace, and what each punctuation does to the line, and reel it in. 

I would recommend a full stop between 'each thumb' and 'as the fear sets in'. It rounds out that last sentence, makes the 'knows it's nearly won' much more significant as it stands on it's own. It's also a long sentence that would benefit from the break. 

Fourth stanza. It wasn't until this point I realised it was about night terrors. Which is nice, because the first portion is entirely me wondering what is happening, and then suddenly realising. The poem is *absolutely* fine as it is, but consider what it would do to the poem if you made it more obvious what it was about from the get-go.

Your third sentence reads like running water *and then* you hit that darned semi-colon before vile. You don't need it, it reads fine without it, it reads better, in fact. It really just brings this whole, wonderful beat you've got going in that sentence to a jarring halt, when it could continue until the sentence ends. Without that semi-colon, that is my favourite sentence in the whole poem. 

Excellent, spine-chilling end to the poem, the rest is perfect.

You know I really liked this piece, it's actually superbly well written, and you've such a finger on the pace, it's controlled ever so tightly, you just let it slip sometimes. The word choice is great, I love it.


(It's possible you didn't intend it to be about night terrors, that's just my interpretation. You can correct me if I'm wrong. The critique stands, except that one bit about introducing the night-terrors sooner, it's all good) 




 Hello. My feeling is that you wanted *judging* to stand out more on it's own, so consider putting a full-stop after expressionless. It breaks judging off, and brings it more into it's own which I think is what you're heading for. It reads the same, just with a bigger pause.

I just want to bring attention to these two lines:

Swallowed by the sea of masqurade masks,

But yours broke long ago.


The first sentence is alliterative in two cases (swallow, sea. Masquerade, masks). And the sentence is smooth, and flows. But then it completely changes pace when you get to the next sentence and suddenly *'but'*. I think with the alliteration you can get away with the hard sylablles, (especially the 'sk' on 'mask'), but that is ruined with the, short, heavy 'but'. Perhaps change it to 'though';

though yours broke long ago.

Reads a bit smoother, coming from the alliterative previous sentence. I understand 'though' might change the story a tad - though the meaning is just as implicit. So if you don't go with 'though' I do recommend tweaking it a touch to something that leads off of the first sentence a bit smoother.

The rest of the poem is pretty darn great. I would say *perhaps* a semi-colon after 'smoulder', but I'm not sure if I'm reading that right, so it's entirely up to you.

Rest is awesome :)

P.S misspelled masquerade as masqurade (I'm sure it's just a typo, though). 




 That's an impressive list.  




 Yeah, I really liked this. Read it a few times and I like the story, it's different and unique and well written.

Not sure if it's a reddit thing but having it written like this it messes with the rhymes, which is fine - the rhymes come through - but it messes with the beat of the piece as well. Which, for a rhyming poem, you don't want. So consider playing around with the structure, seeing what works, what you like, and what suits the beat and those rhymes best.

Also, that comma after the semi-colon on the first line:

 No reason is there to fear, What we see and what we hear.

It works better without the comma. But then you've capitalised the W in what, so I'm not sure what you're trying to say. 

Otherwise, excellent =]
 




 Interesting request for feedback. What kind of feedback were you looking for? 




 Oh yeah, other than the half of the book that wasn't. That was 20 pages worth of album reviews and in-depth looks at what everyone is wearing and everything about it.

I get the point, I really do, move on, Bateman.

Other than that, an excellent book. 




 The first two were incredible. Best fantasy books I've read. But TSRoST is nothing like either of them. I don't know though, you might like it.  




 I didn't read the short story. Just picked up the novel, and really didn't like it. It felt like so much happened, that didn't need to happen, it could have been half the length and at the same level of quality as it was. 




 You're halfway there. 




 NotW and Way of Shadows are two of the best fantasy series going. Good choices.

Ready Player One any good? 




 Already seen the film, really enjoyed it. I did want to read it first but it just appeared on Netflix and, well.... I really enjoyed the film however. But want to read the book because it's meant to be excellent. 




 Yeah, that's pretty darn awesome. 




 I really didn't like it. I have heard that mostly every one did, and I really wanted to like it, but ultimately didn't enjoy it. But that's just one guys opinion.  




 I like how you went on a little science spree there :).

How did you find The Picture of Dorian Gray?

And I don't think I've heard of Middlemarch... 




 You saying you liked Wool? Bleh, I hated it. 




 That makes sense. I don't think it was a bad assumption to say that it was a graphic novel, but fair enough, I was wrong.  




 Let me be the first to say: Ho-lee she'et.

I am impressed. Why the detail? It's good to know how long it took to read, but why the year it was published?

Ok, I'm super fucking impressed. You've put more work into this than I did on my University dissertation. 




 I've never had a problem with auto back-up. I trust it quite a lot actually. Sure, some files have crashed and I've lost some work, but never more than a paragraph or so. 

I've been able to recover every file that was open without issue, really. Not the OO ever really crashes, just when my laptop does in general, taking OO with it. 




 Asimov's laws of robotics? Stated before the book? Is that an example...? 




 You can make money from Wordpress? How do?

I know this is super off-topic, but I had no idea, and would love to know. 




 Graphic novels? Awesome addition.

Haven't heard of the first two. And assume Fortress of Solitude is DC, also.

Interesting jump from DC to Faulkner, any good? Haven't heard of *all the kings men* sorry. 




 So the first three I *super* want to read. Haven't gotten round to it. And TFIOS was a decent read. You gave it a high score so I don't mind heartily recommending *Paper Towns*. Which was absolutely better than TFIOS.

However, if we're talking YA I have to have to have to recommend *The Virgin Suicides, by Eugenides*. It is the paragon of its genre, one of the best books I have ever read. 




 Aaww ah, man. Back in the day Runescape was *the shit*. I think I've played that game more than any other game - count it in months not hours or days.

If you liked Skyrim - you'll like The Witcher. Shadow of Mordor was a brilliant game, but not absolutely similar to other open-world-high-fantasy-rpg's like Skyrim or Dragon Age. 

If you want to start on *decent* fantasy - you can't do better than The Witcher. In fact you've played Skyrim, easily 2nd best. Now all you need to play is Fable Anniversary and you've hit the trifecta. (Though DA1 is always worth a play through). 

If you haven't played a lot of MMORPG's, you might like TESO, I don't know. It depends what else you've played. If you haven't a lot of MMO's - like I have - you might really like it. When you play almost all of them, they all bleed into one. I'm just waiting for the next big one that *does something different!*

Being objective there was nothing particularly wrong with TESO. It ticked the right boxes, and it was a really nice feeling to be back in Morrowind.* Just that it was generic and samey as every other one. TLOTRO and WoW included. Atlantica had a different feel to it, and different combat. FLYFF is one of the most gorgeous MMO's out there, and the aesthetic makes it feel vibrant enough you can slightly overlook that it the gameplay is the same as every other game. Aion does a lot of things well, but at it's core is the same as every other MMO. The only two I haven't played but really want to is Wildstar, but, above all, Guild Wars 2. But I ain't paying for that when I expect I won't like it.

*Morrowind is the third installment into the TES game, and is better than Oblivion, and only marginally not-as-good as Skyrim. It's starting to show it's age (has done for years) but it's one of the most vibrant and alive worlds for a game you can imagine. It's TES so the story is good, and it plays the same as Skyrim, but without the dragons. To offset the dragons the explorability of Morrowind is top-notch. This is mostly helped by the fact it isn't based on medieval England, which most every fantasy game is (and even The Witcher is guilty of). Honestly if you want a superb fantasy game outside of the limits of medieval-england-fantasy, look no farther than Morrowind. 

P.S This whole message is based on *fantasy* RPG's. Sci-fi, and otherkinds, aren't so much my expertise. 




 I've just never been the best. I've never really been good at anything so I struggle with that. I'd like to be that person, I would, to laugh and joke off my inabilities, but I'd struggle to do it. I'd just hate myself for being not-as-good, or not-at-all-good. And wish I could be better. Putting in the effort and getting nothing back...that's a hard pill to swallow.  




 Phahahaha. I'm sorry - wait let me laugh some more.

Ok.

You honestly want to compare that generic, tripe, pieceofshit "game", that really is just fodder for your HDD to waste. To what is, hands down, one of *the best* **games**, *not just open-world, or rpg,* **game**.

Get. The. Witcher.

Also, don't consider TESO. Really not a good MMORPG. The best MMORPG I've ever played (and I've played pretty much every one) is Atlantica. Also FLYFF.  Aion is a good shout, but there isn't much too it to separate it. Same for Rift. Wildstar looks like it might be good (one of the few I haven't played) and it's going f2p soon, so worth checking out once that happens.

Let me just enamour the Witcher 3 some more. Name an open-world game. It's better than it. Fantasy RPG's? It's the best. Over Dragon-Age and (dare I say it) Skyrim. You've been waiting for proof the new gen is worth investing in: VOILA! 




 Loki (Finished sci-fi, YA (fuck-knows) novel - 125,000k. Countless rejections.

New, untitled project - so far only 20k words but growing.

And then god knows how many short stories (very few finished) one of which is a decent 25k. And poems. 




 Are we talking Neopets as in...that bright website where you look after a Neopet, and battle it and minigames and such?

Because if we are, man I used to love the shit out of that game! Played it for years. It was the best. It quickly got pushed out by Runescape. That's how long ago this was. Over ten years haha. I thought Neopets was dead, tbh. 




 I would say Word but I'm poor so Open Office. Does the job. I've tried programs built specifically for writing and they're always a pain in the ass. So many things just get in the damn way. I'm sure I had one, and I couldn't start writing until I had written, a title, and chapter-title, and characters and all of this anal BS and I couldn't find how to (or it wouldn't let me) just write.

Nothing wrong with Word. Absolutely great. Does the job, does it simply, does it well. 




 Have to say that made me smile. Thanks :) 




 Neopet? 




 So I know sure if that's the right word for it. But I also feel quite inferior to people. Recently my friend got a 1st in his Uni degree. I only got a second. I hide behind this viciously by saying I never tried and put all the effort into my novel, instead. I put him down by saying "well I was smarter than you in High School" which I know damn well ain't true.

So like I said I don't know if it's an inferiority complex. But whenever I feel...inferior, I lash out like an asshole and try and put myself above him, if not about the same thing (say, academically) then about something else. And I don't like being an asshole.

And yes, it makes me super competitive, and sometimes a sore loser - but I know when I'm going to be beat, and I don't mind if I foresee it. Usually it makes me just not want to compete.

Inferiority complex? Or asshole-ism?   




 As it says: wtf is battle toads? 




 I've had mine going for 2 years this september. It's super interesting to look back and see what I've read. I have a .doc and also a goodreads account (for keeping track of the 52 books a year challenge).

 Dwarf Fortress is hella intimidating, I'm looking into it myself but it might prove too much.

Yeah, sorry about the minecraft thing. I think once it gets into it it will separate from MC quite drastically. By the looks of it it's much more of a "town-sim" to MC's "build-for-the-shits-and-giggles." 




 *Stoner, by John Williams*. One of the best books ever written. And the most in-depth look, the most human showcase in any book I've ever found. It essentially follows the life of one man, William Stoner, from birth to death. Truly an amazing book. But it does take place mostly early to mid 1900's, so it's not a contemporary setting, if that detracts anything for you.

I also recommend the hard-back edition with the grey cover. Not only does it look nicer, it's also the best binding *ever*. And how many books can claim that accolade?

Also, though to a lesser extend. *Humans, by Matt Haig*. It's about an alien who inhabits a human body and has to come to terms with what it means to be human. It's not a heavy book, and makes for a pretty light read. It has its moments, but it's not quite an in-depth look at the "human experience" as you might want. 




 Also a game in early access called StoneHearth (not Hearthstone) that sounds like it might tick all those boxes. 




 Support indie titles as much as AAA games. Whether on Steam, XBLA or PSN.  




 Oh yeah, I got that the day it came out. Did absolutely everything. Of course, on autodrive, I haven't forgotten a thing about that game. All the tricks =] 




 Fable TLC. I can do that whole game on autodrive. Never played a game so much. It still is absolutely excellent. 




 To put it bluntly: "Neil Gaiman is a God" 




 I like to think how hard I'm going to steal that name haha. :)

But also, yes. They would have been the best of friends. Aristotle and Confucius.  




 I didn't like AC1 to be honest. Far too repetitive. But AC2 was amazing. And I liked Brotherhood, and Revelations. Ac3 was a colossal disappointment, which I didn't even finish, because it wasted the first few hours of my gameplay as *not even the main character*.
(It also skips over how hundreds of years of generations are Assassins but then suddenly, *templar!*,).
Black Flag was simply great. And they really fucked up with Unity. Not just because it was shit, but because they took out the core mechanic that made Black Flag amazing.

But I am interested in the new one. I've been saying they should set one in London since AC2, so I'm pretty interested to play a title set in my own home. Having said that, will definitely be checking reviews before I get it. 




 Like they'd have to do anything to make it stand out. This is *Half Life 3* we're talking about. 




 Yeah, there's still just a lot to learn even to get it up and running. (That's why I like Unity - it does the hard stuff for you). 




 That is actually a super-duper-awesome name for a cat. I think Vinegar might even beat the philosophers... 




 I think there is definitely a market for that. Without a doubt. Can't be too hard to program either? 




 Yeah I'm really not that advanced. I can do basic Java. I haven't found the time to really put myself into learning C# (or enough Java to make a functioning game). So I joined a game as something I can do - write. Break(ing) into the industry one way or another :P 




 The good thing is we come up with the best names for out cats. When we got a new cat I wanted to call him Socrates, but my girlfriend didn't like it and called him Jaffa. 




 I'm mostly concentrating on C# because it's what Unity uses. But I know as well that if I can write C#, with a little application and some time it shouldn't be *too* big a leap to learn C++. That's a semi-educated presumption, I don't know how true it is. But I'm happy just being able to write for Unity. 




 I am taking your advice and taking my dog out for a walk :) 




 I've just never found Python to be of any use whatsoever. I didn't Java any more difficult to learn (and I learnt more of it), and it's more useful, more practical. 

How's C++? I never made that jump.  




 I've looked into C# and it is true that once you can grasp one language (that isn't fucking Python) you can get your head around the others. Even knowing a touch of Java made some of C understandable.  




 The story is nothing like Portal. I can't say the game isn't similar, because, yeah, it was a huge inspiration on the design, but we have taken steps to differentiate, it's been a big part of both the story and game play to make it different. But a comparison to Portal is inevitable, which might not be a bad thing. 




 Good luck learning C++. I know basic Java, but struggled enough with that. I know how much of a pain any C language could be. And hey once you know it, you can make anything :) 




 The game is called Anomaly 1729. I think they're aiming for an October(? - Christ I should know this) release. The game was greenlit on steam so keep an eye out for it. The mechanics of the game and puzzle-design is, I think, genius. 




 This is true. Stop being lazy. People need to play your game. 




 I had a cat called Aristotle, who didn't come back one night. We lived next to a main road (doubly worried), so we had to go out round our neighbourhood, through this busy street packed with cars, stuck in congestion, watching us as we shouted *"Aristotle. Aristotle!* 




 My team greenlit the script for a game I'm working on, and it's being implemented into the game now. So I thought rather than work on my *other* game, I'd work on my novel for a while. Work on my own project. But damn...Sat at my desk on my laptop, I'm really struggling to find the energy to do just that :(

Please help me find the energy. 




 Put up where? Anywhere? 




 If the work was going I'd happily do it for free (for now). If I knew people who wanted a music video, I'd be all over it.

So, any advice on how to construct a portfolio from limited work? 




 Haven't really done any work. Most of it's all graduate stuff I did at University. I'm trying to build a portfolio. I'm looking for work, I really am, that's why I'm redoing my showreel. What do I do if I haven't done enough work to present even a semi-decent portfolio? 




 I wrote my whole novel this way. Just had loose ideas of where it was heading, but in general the entire novel happened organically. 

It took me longer to write than it should have. I think that's how you pay. What took me the longest to write wasn't the writing, it was trying to figure out which direction to take it in.

My new novel I sat down, spent two months planning it out, making everything fit, so it worked and I had a decent plan I could follow. I haven't sunk my teeth into that project yet but now I know it won't take me as long. There are scenes that are harder to write, some I don't want to write. And that was true in my first novel, so I didn't write them, I put it off. Now I have a plan I know exactly what is going to happen in that scene, I've come to terms with it, so I can just get down to it. 

I don't want to say planning is the best way to go until I've finished my current novel. But having worked on a novel that I wrote organically, I wouldn't support it wholeheartedly.  




 What do you think, having watched it, is most extraneous? Or least useful/strong? 




 Definitely useful. Appreciate it =]
 




 You gotta sign up to see it? Did not know that :/ Thanks. 




 MMORPG

That is all. 




 So I'm trying to push to get some editing jobs and a decent showreel is really what's going to help there. Please give it a watch, and let me know what you think. It is on dropbox so the quality might be a bit meh, but it should be ok. If not, let me know I'll drop it on Vimeo.

 You ask this like there's some kind of trick, or magical secret anyone who's finished anything is keeping from you.

There is nothing. No trick. No secret. You don't need any tips. Just write.

That's what writing is. It's actually sitting your ass down and *doing something*. 




 What's wrong with pre-orders 




 Oh my god.

*Oh my god*

*OMAGOD*!

*AAAAHH!!!*

**ERMAGHERD!!** 




 Most important question of all: Do you have any job openings? 




 Pixar are champions for coming up with unique ideas and brilliant stories. How much time and effort do you put in the stories and scripts - long before production even starts - to make sure they are up to the quality of every film you make? 




 Actually over half-way through  




 When they're done swimming in the money from GTA5 like Scrooge McDuck. (AKA:Never) 




 Awesome name you have there ;) 




 I'm not. But my wallet is ;) 




 I don't really have an opportunity to 'show not tell' here. It's the first sentence of my novel. Not saying the advice is unappreciated, just that I don't quite understand how it applies. (which is a cry for help). 




 Having not seen his entire filmography I don't want to say his worst. But the best film of his that I've seen is "Inglorious Basterds" 




 No they left. They were for a good six hours though :'(.

Never considered doing yoga. Really not my thing. I'm really not into any form of exercise - but I'm trying. I'm gunna start exercising soon. Just not yoga. 




 I'm glad you found it funny. 




 Ah, there was some work I wanted to get done and they were too noisy, same with reading or anything really. I couldn't leave my room to eat, so I've starved all day. But they are working on the floor so it's fair enough I can't walk on it till it's done. So yeah, kinda annoying. 




 Hmm...Not sure what an English counterpart would be. Let me google...

...

They look mostly like potato croquettes, but I don't think they are anything like that. (P.S potato croquettes aren't even half as posh as they sound. It's just the English language being all faux posh again). 




 I don't know what those are 




 Fries. What you call chips we call crisps. So when I say all I like is chips, I mean fries. Particularly McDonalds. 




 Just to make sure we're on the same page. Are you American? Because if you are then we're talking about completely different kinds of chips. Me being British and all. If you're not then we are on the same page, and I apologise. Just making sure =] 




 Acting is not the word I would use. Butchering. Profusely. That's how I would describe it. 




 No. I really don't. It makes for difficult eating. Mostly meat and chips =] 




 I seem to have stumbled into a hole in the theatrical market... 




 Vegetables. 




 A one-man performance of Shakespeare's Julius Caesar would be sure to confuse them. 




 Just youtube them and make your way down the list. Listen to a playlist or mix. They are excellent. 




 I don't see how that would help... 




 Not convinced I'm too keen on that whole yoga thing. But the talky thing, yeah =] 




 You've never heard of The Arctic Monkeys? 




 As you do... 




 But then I'm locked out my *entire house* :( 




 I am. Currently jamming to The Arctic Monkeys. 




 The floor is being laid out in the hall, so unfortunately I can't really leave my room. Help me stave off this hella boredom. 




 [The Cat Empire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QM_rIaUm7ac)

Shuck yeah! 




 What do you mean "going"?

 




 It's an old truth that somewhere out in the Travern hills there is an abandoned WW2 bunker.


Hmmm....

It's a better first paragraph. 
























 I just felt there was very little substance to it. Very little happened. She plodded along - met Adam (who then disappeared sharpish) and plodded along some more until the finale of the book. And that was it. Not a bad book - just...I expected more from McEwan I suppose. Especially after *Sweet Tooth*. 




 I would recommend *Sweet Tooth* over *The Children Act*. I really enjoyed it, but it did again feel a bit overlong in places. No worse than Atonement. But yes, it was a really good read.  




 I found DA Origins to be the worst for this.

Also a steam game called *Legend of Grimrock*. The spiders in that are huge and they jump at you. Their bodies fill the entire screen as they lunge. They make the scariest noise and they just attack randomly so it's super difficult to expect. Also very difficult to run away. 




 Does Bloodborne count?

I've played horror games. Slender. Amnesia, etc. 

But when that damn werewolf broke out of that door three paces ahead of me I've never jumped so much at a game in my life. 




 That is perfect. Thankyou very much :) 




 50 Shades from Christian's perspective. *gag/vomits.* 




 Well played, sir :) 




 Grey 




 Mostly I'm thinking of the kind you get through the door. But email spam is also useful. Any kind of crap you don't want to receive, that isn't quite a letter, and just goes straight in the bin.

It's all for research. I promise it's not as weird a question as you might think. 




 I haven't read *Enduring Love* but I really want to. *Saturday* as well. *Atonement* was great but I felt it was a bit too long, parts were too dragged out.

Did you read *Sweet Tooth*? 




 You should read *'The Cement Garden'* by him. That's an uncomfortable read. On Chesil Beach was just awesome. 




 Doesn't the Wii U have Gamecube compatibility? Not something I've ever had to consider so I don't know... 




 It actually did! :)  




 Literature does that ;) 




 Then make it big enough. That's the point :) 




 I suppose so. But with the gameplay being so different to any other MOBA I feel like it doesn't quite fit into the genre. It looks much more interesting. And I don't really like MOBA's. 




 Thankyou for this. My life is a better place with this in it. 




 I remember when I first got my original Xbox. Way back when. I really wanted to play the first Halo game. I'd heard great things about it, but the person who sold me my xbox had lent it out, and was waiting to get it back to give it to me.

I thought I could wait, and not play my xbox till I got Halo. But I got a pile of games with it. Midtown Madness. A Rayman game. A few others. But, most interestingly of all I got a game called...

Morrowind.

I didn't know what this was. The cover was a title and a symbol. And I refused to play it, waiting for Halo. I put it off. I would go over and pick up the case and look at it. For some reason I was strangely drawn to it. There was no reason for me to like it. I was young, mostly new to gaming, never really played or heard of anything like this. Didn't know what an RPG was. After a while I thought *"Dammit, I'm just gunna play this game. I can't stop thinking about it, sod Halo"*

It. Was. Amazing. It still is to this day one of the best RPG's I've played. It changed how I viewed and played games, what stories I wrote and how I wrote them. Introduced me to the concept of games being more than racing, or platforming. 

I never did get Halo. I didn't play the first one until the MCC came out on XB1. 

Also Fable 2 on Xbox 360. The only reason I got a 360, and fuck was that an amazing game. My mom got me a really good 360 (there were about two dozen version (at an estimate guess) and I was worried I wouldn't get the right one). But my Mom pulled through and got me the best one, and my Grandma got me Fable 2. First Christmas I didn't spend with my family, I was playing Fable 2.

Also Crash Bandicoot on the PS1. My parents tricked me and my sisters and pretended we had nothing. Then unveiled it. I got Space Jam. My little sister got Casper. And my big sister got Crash Bandicoot. This was in...'96?? From that moment on I've been a gamer.

Tl;dr: Morrowind for Xbox. Fable 2 for 360. Crash Bandicoot for PS1. 




 Here is the showcase of the gameplay in action, showing you the core gameplay system, and it is just...awesome.

[Clickity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp3NKQlJPuo)

And another video, about the game in general.

[Clickity 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiwzcurrhAY)

The first video is more exciting. Watch that first. :) 




 Not if I'm planning on having 90k by the end of the year. It's taken me too long and I need to knuckle down :(

But thanks for the encouragement :) 




 I was meant to work on my novel today too. I'm just coming up to 20,000 words in my own novel. Making piss-poor progress.

I was meant to work on my game today. I didn't. Thankfully my lead isn't too demanding just yet, and I still have time. Though I think the workload is going to smack me, and hard, when it comes. This is just for the demo. This isn't even the whole game.

Ooh! I did get to play bass. Didn't quite learn a new song but I perfected two I had been practicing and started a third.

I nearly went out a bought a ukulele for the shits and giggles - because secretly everyone wishes they could play the ukelele. Right?

About 75% less productive today than I wanted to be. I got an assignment for my *other* game today, which isn't too hard, so I hope I can chuck that out tomorrow...

*walks off grumbling about productivity* 




 Inspiration is a BS lie. If anyone worked only when they were "motivated" or "inspired", nothing would ever, ever get done. 




 Fine I'll introduce a caveat: as good as, if not somewhat better, than what most people would expect from a contemporary AAA release. No game is flawless.

But my own experience, on XB1, was, and is still, perfect. 




 I saw gameplay. I've seen the core function of the game. And that in itself looks awesome. I'm certainly skeptical because the inherent flaws are immediate, but I'm willing to give them a chance and see what they've done to sort them out. I don't trust expo demonstrations, I really don't. So I'm going to keep my eye out and see what happens, and how it expands, and, most importantly, on what they have to say about the gameplay.

Otherwise, it looks awesome. 




 The Elder Scrolls - the three main ones.

Why absolutely no nudity? I really have to ask. Because The Witcher ticks *every single one* of those boxes.  




 0.01% inspiration.

99.99% GET OFF YOUR ARSE AND DO SOME BLOODY WORK, LAD! 




 I got into the beta for TESO. That game was dead to me before it's release. I know enough to be cautious about games, and I rarely ever buy games on the day of their release. For obvious reasons.

I just want to be so excited for this game. 




 Buy a Wii u. Backwards compatibility, after all. 




 Sorry, bud =] 




 Computer Science. Will shoehorn you into programming, as a lot of science is programming languages...(as far as I know.)

Also, as pointed out, even if you don't go into gaming you'll find that with a Computer Science degree, any other job will almost definitely earn you more money.

 




 Memento.

Hey, see what I did there ;) 




 *The Virgin Suicides*, by Eugenides. And,

*On Chesil Beach*, by Ian McEwan. 

Because they are the two strongest openings to a book I have ever encountered. 




 Support the industry that you love. Flaws and all.

I think that's the crux of the argument. 




 That's a fair enough statement. 

A release date would also be nice :) 




 This is totally dependant on where you live. I live in the UK and there are caveats that allow people to not be paid - assuming that the person doing the working doesn't mind working voluntarily.

If you're american it might change state-to-state. Or anywhere else. I know the UK government does supply the info, and can be found on their website. Otherwise, any governing bodies for films should have the information somewhere. 

Either way the answer is a Google away. 




 400M into advertising. Thankyou Activision.

100M into making the game. 


(Extremely rough estimates) 




 Given the spate of absolutely abysmal releases recently (or not-so-recently), when a studio like CD Projekt Red comes along and does everything perfectly, they're praised. Rightly so, they even included a little slip inside the game thanking people for buying their game. That's how you do a game release right. 

Then on the other hand you have a game more typical of a AAA release: buggy, unfinished, poor quality. Complaining is the gamers way of striving for something better than what we have. 

TW3 proved that it can be done, and be done perfectly. It's easy to slate a bad game when a few weeks back we had one of the best releases in recent memory - and for a truly excellent game. 

As for frame rate issues for TW3. I got it on XB1 and I've hardly ran into any issues. 




 Don't blame devs, devs aren't to blame. Devs want to put out as good a game as they possibly can, but that's not up to them. It's up to the publishers. Blame the publishers. 




 You run around and shoot things. 




 Physical books. Because a library on a device can't even compare to a library on a shelf. 




 I know I am. That game looks amazing. Who else will be getting it when it comes out? 




 For two weeks every summer I used to go my Nanna and Granddads house. It was massive, absolutely huge. Had a swimming pool and a jacuzzi. They used to rent out the bottom floor to holiday-makers during the summer-period, that's how nice and big it was. There was this tree we used to climb (my siblings and many, various cousins). About 2-3 acres of garden just to run around in and play. It was amazing. Really great time.

Anyway a few years back they moved out - the place was too large to look after and my grandparents were getting on. Next thing I heard it had been knocked down and a block of flats put in. That sucks.  




 That's fair enough. Whatever works better for you. You just have to be on top of your word count and progress. And I know how slow it can be going when you aren't sure what your characters' next steps should be. 




 I wrote my first novel spontaneously. I prefer to say organically, because it grew organically as it went. 

This one I have a plan for. And I think maybe a plan is better. Certainly this second novel has more depth, and more is happening underneath. The characters come together and intertwine better than in my first one. Purely because I've got it all planned out what exactly my two main protagonists are doing. Even when they're not together I know what they've been doing in the absence. 

Haven't not completed this novel I can't support a structured plan entirely - but the way things are going, I'm happy to endorse a plan. 




 Maybe write a decent structure, and a proper plan. Then, when you only have time to write a page or two, you know exactly what you want to write for those two pages. Best advice I can give. Keep you on track. Heading in the right direction. Less turning around and rewriting and seeing what was happening, and if it makes sense and is leading in the right direction. 




 I'm making a list of things to watch/listen to/read that'll help me write when I'm not in the mood. Anything you can contribute is great. 




 Not a horror novel. Horror elements. But not in the orthodox sense.

You got a decent plan for it? A structure to follow? 




 I should have guessed that. Ah well, I answered another question for you for free :D

This novel it's about malevolent spirits. I'm heading towards a very difficult scene, that I've been slowly working my way towards sentence-by-sentence for weeks. I'm there now, just a few more details. So it's been slow progress. 

You sound like you're already aware of how bad it is to rewrite, rather than just finish. So I don't have to warn you about the pitfalls of rewriting constantly. Whatever you write you're not going to be happy with it. It's not meant to be good. It's not going to be good. It's never going to be good. Leave it be, that's how it is with everyone. It doesn't matter how many drafts you write it's still going to be the same, and you'll never like it. You have to edit it into shape. That's where it all starts to come together. When you edit it. Not when you write it. 









 Progress wise? About 25k words, aiming to finish at 90k. Nice round number :)

And yours? 




 I'm pretty much the same. Progress is super slow. Almost at a halt. 




 To keep my life on some kind of track:

* Read (this one will never end)

* Complete The Witcher 3

* Finish writing novel

* Finish work on video game x 2

* Put poetry on Figment/Reddit for feedback (done - awaiting feedback)

* Convince others to start YouTube channel with me.

* Find short story competitions and enter

* Check Shooting People [film jobs]

* Check IndieDB [indie-game jobs]

And that's it. Just do all that and my life will head in the right direction. Not. So. Easy.



 




 I'd say you could possibly come back to DA after The Witcher 3, but I just think it would be so flawed after playing TW3 - an unadulterated masterpiece.

I'm sorry to have put you off DA. It started well, but didn't hold it. I wanted to like it but couldn't, so I know what it's like to have to drop a game. Let's just say - if you do drop it - I'm saving you a few hours that will only end in heartbreak. 




 Story is better. Combat is better. Protagonist is better. Quest system and quests are better. There isn't as much variety within the biomes - and I have to give Inquisition it's due, those dragon's were impressive. But The Witcher has better gameplay, and a more polished look. There's also less time sorting through your party to see if the trousers your mage has on is as good as the one in your pack. You only have to look after Geralt; infinitely easier. The story in The Witcher holds together tighter, even when you're away from it for a while doing Witcher-y things and side quests. 

This is all The Witcher 3, Witcher 2 is somewhat different. But if you're playing 2, finish it, it's a great game. Then move sharpish onto 3. Which is an amazing game. 




 Just wanted to say thanks for this. I've come across Grist before, but not poetry. It's nice to see poetry isn't dead in England. 




 I find that games like that are so long you'll never get one or the other finished if you don't just concentrate on one. I recommend concentrating on just one. And I recommend concentrating on just The Witcher.

I'm sorry. They're such good games. 




 Don't write a strict outline. Write a basic one, a bare one. Chart down the major points, and nothing in between. This gives you absolute freedom to do anything in between. You have the main points down, and those are the turning points, you just head from to the other to the next. If a new character comes in, there's space to do that, if one dies, there's space for it. If something totally significant happens that you hadn't counted on, that's fine, just as long as you're heading to your next key point, you're on track.

Then *edit edit edit edit edit edit*. 




 Whilst I enjoyed Inquisition, I tried really hard to finish it, it just got to a point where I couldn't do it. It just wasn't working out.

I recommend saving yourself the trouble and just swapping it out for *The Witcher 3*. Which in a few hours proved better than the 40+ I put into DA before giving up. 




 What's wrong with the public domain name Loki? 




 I've got another one:

Somebody called me pretentious once. I was so outraged I spat out my latte.

Ah, coffee related humour.  




 Yours to have =] 




 Times like I wish I had played

* Any of the Mass Effect games

* Any of the Uncharted games

* any of the Just Cause games.

Iyam behind. 




 What you meant to say was: "Another greedy, money-grabbing attempt to subvert what was hitherto a decent escape from a declined, capitalistic culture too concerned with shit tv."

Mostly it's the "shameless, money-grabbing, leave no survivors (especially, ya know, art) attitude. 




 You just wanna get the specs. HD, LED are your main concerns. If you can push into 4K then why not. Sony do overall make good TV's but don't entirely discount the other good TV brands. (My kinect is covering the maker of my TV, I think it's a panasonic. I dunno I got it from Tesco). 




 So like a mo-cap suit? 

Sounds feasible. My only issue would be power, having a big ole' battery strapped to your condom-suit somewhere. 




 Ps4 I think is meant to be technically superior. But being as the only decent exclusive PS4 has is Bloodborne - a gothic, low-lit game - then eh... Killzone looked good, but I have no idea if the game is any good.

The E3 footage of Horizon looking stunning, however.

What really matters is this: graphics don't make or break a game. Now what's an amazing game? Shadow of the Colossus. Not the best looking game. But it's one of the best that will ever be made. 




 That explains the parentheses in your title =] 




 Why did the hipster burn his tongue? 

He drank coffee before it was cool. 




 Game is this? 




 Ah I really loved The Maze Runner, though it was fantastic. 

John Dies is a good book, a touch long, I thought, but actually a very good book. I got into it fairly quickly. 




 Sounds like you want an Xbox One then. 




 From your list: Evolve is a very good game, but I don't know how many people play it now. Ori is meant to be a spectacular game, but not a very long one - though it is the cheapest on your list. GTA5 might be a good shout, people will still be playing that online, and you can get a good few hours out of the campaign.

Otherwise, The Witcher 3, hands down, is the best way to go. 




 Hands down :)

Best movie of all time, imo.  




 Well, this is perfect.

That's it, I'm done. There's nothing more I can say. I few itchy word choices, but that kept the tone low and somber, rather than edgy and sick, which is what I would have gone for. 
The pace is good, the style and narrative is spot-on, absolutely perfect.

But I think the first three lines aren't as strong as the rest of the poem. I think you use those to find your voice, and it doesn't come through until the fourth line. That's my only critique. 

Thought I'd return the favour for *My Dreams are Fire* but this is kinda so perfect it belies critique.  




 Thanks, friend. I wrote this a good number of years back in an emotional rage, and only recently came to and tidied it up. So it's good to hear some positive feedback, that it isn't just a messed up piece of shit. So thanks. I'm glad to find you liked it. 

Appreciate you putting so much thought and effort into this, I really do :) 




 The Prestige. 'Cause Nolan. 




 Thanks, that was great feedback. It's always nice to hear what others think, and it was pretty awesome for me to read too. Thanks, stranger =] 




 Well I guess the only thing I would need - were I to set out on my own venture - is advice on promoting. I've promoted stories before, sometimes fairly successfully, it's just a bitch. A lot of back scratching. For someone successful it would be worth getting an insiders view. All I need is a story I can either serialise, or work into a full novel. 




 Thanks, this was great. I will rewrite it tomorrow. Seems I'm going to have to elucidate some of this vagueness. 




 Horse Armor. It doesn't matter where it started. That's where it went to shit. 




 Bray-vo! En-core! 




 Ahh, I see what you did there! hehehe. 




 Let's talk about something positive. Turn that frown upside down! Whoo! 




 Ah, it'll take a lot more than a touch of negativity to make me regret ever receiving a fantastic little orange envelope. 




 Yeah I made a thread, on the gaming subreddit too, got a fair bit of negativity. Y'know I expected some people to not agree with me, but I also expected someone to agree with me - at least a little bit. Nope. 




 It's worth it to read to expand the world, and the Underthing most of all. It is worth it for people who Rothfuss's world and writing.  




 Dopamine. 




 Yeah, I got all that. I've never seen a call for a query that doesn't include a bit of information about a book - a blurb, in essence. Everything else I have. A synopsis too. Enough to cater to individual agents requests. Just want to tidy this up, the rest, I think, is ok. 




 Trying to find a balance between vagueness and information. Don't know if that's a good idea, though. 




 Also no, this isn't all of my query. I have a cover letter too. But that's its own demon. 




 Care to lend an experienced hand (advice)? 




 It's a query letter. Part of the requirement. Just a short synopsis to describe the book, and get a feel for what it is. Blurb is just the best way to phrase it. 




 This poem is a few years old at this point and I only met you this afternoon. ^^ =D. I've always put a lot of time and editing into this so it wasn't good to start with.

Thanks =] 




 Bloody Fallout 4 first. I'm pretty sure that after that it'll be the next TES. I mean, they can just sheer off a small team to remaster Morrowind, that's all I'm asking for. 




 No, no...I didn't misspell 'fourty'. English...English spelling.

I'm going for vagueness, and I'm just trying to find the balance between information and vague. 




 Have some happiness =] 




 One, thanks for that :)

Two, yeah, blurb writing...not a talent. Trying to fit a lot of information in a short space, not easy. 




 Thankyou, and I absolutely understand what you're saying about there being too many phrases. I certainly missed that one.

You're second blurb is absolutely perfect, except I want to mention his...they're not humans, I guess the best way to say it would be homunculus - and I want to introduce that there is one of those who manages to catch up with him as well. 




 Thanks for typing back. I'm glad you enjoyed the critique. I always like it when people put back saying they were grateful rather than just telling to F-off and leave their poem alone. 

As far as the poem goes, it really was excellent, and thank you for letting me read it.  




 A game as excellent as Morrowind being the exception, of course. :) 




 I'm going to start pushing trying to publish this soon, and would really love a polished blurb to go along with the book. I would appreciate any advice, or insightfulness you have.

The novel is called Loki:

Loki is a born and bred survivor, having been chased for fourty years he is confident his abilities will keep him alive and out of their hands[*]. A shocking death and a surprise ambush from one of his old kin may just knock everything he knows out from under his feet. His pursuers are growing more and more desperate, and he might finally have to resurface to face them once and for all.

*generally don't know what to do with this. Their hands is too vague, but I'm trying to not be too specific.
 




 I'd ask you more questions but then you risk becoming my blog/serial guru. And you don't want that. 

Thanks for everything =] 




 Meaning you're getting back into it? Or not? 




 Whoa, thanks so much that's an excellent reply. Really great information. 

Also well done, impressive statistics. No longer active, why's that?

 




 I have heard of Skywind, I meant to look into and totally forgot until just this moment.  




 Anyone else agree? I would love to get a chance to play that game on Xbox One or PS4. 




 I'm sure you know, but just to warn you TSRoST is nothing like TKKC in general. Really not even similar anything between them. Just Auri. 

*adds Ready Player One to 'reading list'* 




 No problem on the feedback. And that's a great solution. 'Though' probably wasn't the best choice but I think you've found it of your own accord (certainly better than my suggestion). Awesome. :)

And you continue the alliteration - you, yours. Double-win =] 




 That's really interesting. And I knew absolutely nothing about it. Mind if I ask how one would go about starting up one of these? And maintaining it? And promoting it, how you seem to have done. 




 He's a selfish prick too preoccupied with his own survival, and too wrapped up in his own conflicts. 




 Thanks man, that's perfect =] I love it. 




 That is the best trilogy of books I've ever read. I cannot recommend a book more wholeheartedly than I recommend The Amber Spyglass. It is fantastic. Amazing. Perfect. Just...finish the trilogy. I can't put into words how good it is. 
























 I like to keep busy. I'm not really doing anything with my degree, so I have to make sure I'm working towards what I really want. Writing for games, becoming a novelist. And somewhat trying to break into film (my degree) with a short film I need to start... 




 No. If it is something that can be taught I'm certainly not the person to be teaching it. 

Neil Gaiman is the best person to look to for this advice. There are plenty others, let me find the video. [This video is genius! Just watch this, it solves everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-C48jAkVlI0) 




 Requiem for a Dream. That's a must.

Dallas Buyer's Club as well, though I haven't seen that myself, he was meant to be amazing.

Also, though Leto is barely in it, you haven't seen Fight Club? You need to see fight club. I don't care if I'm breaking the first two rules, see fight club. 




 Yeah The Amazing Spider Man 2 kinda bombed. But that didn't mean the setup for the Sinister Six wasn't spot on. Dehaan made a great Goblin. We could have actually got a decent Venom. And a whole host of other baddies. I'm eager to see where Marvel take it, but that won't be for another few years now. I just like to imagine what could have been done, and would have liked to have seen the universe they started up expand. 

And for *God's Sake* somebody put *Carnage* into a goddamn spider man movie! 




 Depends how well received the character is. Spotlight is absolutely on Leto. And that does give her a chance to shine. The problem with this film is that there is so much potential for it to bomb. I don't want it to, I don't expect it to. But it might. 




 This week I've been getting up early so I can really put some work into my book. Trying to pump out at least 1k words a day. Which is great because that takes me about an hour, and I can then work on either my games, or developing my screenplay :) 




 Suicide Squad...? 




 They're definitely going to do a sequel. No doubts. Just no idea when. 




 I think they said if they ever did another game it would be with a whole set of different characters. It wouldn't surprise me if they did, perhaps, return to Ellie, maybe even Joel, but I don't think they want to do that any time soon. 




 Why would a prequel make more sense? 




 Add me: MC SHIMMY 




 I understand that. I couldn't help you find a rare, old book company. There has been a lot of news recently about first-edition novels being sold at auction. If you investigate those that might lead you down the right path, perhaps.

Failing that. If you're expecting close to 1k, shelling out $120 isn't too bad when you're guaranteed a decent return. 




 Also watch the Youtube channel 'Extra Credits' if you don't already. They do videos on game design and they're incredibly useful. They do a set of videos on game narrative which you *have to watch*, but also look at the others to get a good overview of game design in general. If you can bleed good game design and game-design-understanding into your prose, all the better for you. 




 http://gamejournalismjobs.com/

This is a great site, the one I got my job from. Just don't hold out for paid work. I wrote seven articles, and got paid $.70 so...You just have to be willing to work for free.

Never heard of that Neverwinter Nights module. :)

Having a degree is certainly a boost. My degree is in film (which helps for screenplays) but not prose (which is why my novel was so important). You just have to find the right assets you possess and plug them. 

The thing about working in the industry is that it breaks into two compartments: Design, and programming. Programming is obviously...just what it says. Design covers modelling, texturing, concept art, an entire haberdashery of jobs. But nothing that commits to writing. Most studios pull writers from designers who work in another department. Like I said, not a lot of studios have dedicated writers. You could get an intership, sure. No problem. It would be mostly office work, which is something you could do. Your difficulty then comes in where to take it from the internship. You can't program, or design. If they don't need a writer, you're out of luck and stuck as an intern. 

This is why I recommend the indie route. There are a lot of indie companies out there who have formed from the previous workers of AAA studios. You probably won't start there, but you can work your way up there. It *is* a ladder. Unlike AAA gaming a lot of of indie games do put emphasis on story, and will hire a writer to allow their meagre staff to work on programming and design. That's why it's so good. If you write a game and it breaks out (mine is out in three months, here's to hoping it's successful), then you could get jobs coming to you. 

Oh, also, I've been working on this game for over a year. Coming on to two. I joined the game after they'd been working on it for nearly a year. Don't expect to have a gaming portfolio built up quickly. If you can prioritise work, and work efficiently, you can join multiple games and have a number of games released roughly the same times. Which leads me to...

Most of the jobs you join will collapse. It's the nature of the work. I've joined over 20 companies, some have just never been able to stay in contact, of their ideas are too ambitious, or the team just implodes. If you can work out quickly which teams are likely to stick at it and which aren't, you'll do yourself a big favour. Mostly the best way to check is to look for if the studio has anything previously released.

Also, look into GDD's, writing crowd-funding campaigns and other writer-y things. Again, it's all to put into the portfolio. You want to convince the team you're the best person so show them you can do more than write a story. Anything that involves words, you can cover it, you're the guy to do it. 




 Can't you go along to a second-hand book store, or equivalent and get them 'appraised', so to speak? 

If you had an idea of value, it wouldn't be difficult to sell them through Ebay or equivalent. Someone out there will know how much a book of that type and age and quality is worth. 




 YES YES YES YES!

I didn't get this until last year, which was a couple of years after it 'resurged'. Not reading this book the moment it piqued my interest was a mistake. Normally when I finish a book I mull it over and decide how much I like the final product, whether or not it approaches the level of my favourite novels. But with this I was a few pages in and I just *knew* it was amazing, that it would go on to be one of my favourites. The prose was consitently beautiful throughout, each stage of his life was heart-wrenching and human and true. I was so surprised by how amazing it was, because it was just fantastic. No one could have expected a novel to be so good. It set out to do something unique, and it really delivered! 

I would love someone to write something so in-depth about a life like that in modern times. Would be a really interesting look at our society. 




 I always give my characters two things:

Values, and

Motivations.

What does your character value? What motivates them? For characters enduring a journey, that's a large part of it done. I know that characters aren't always that simple and there are shade of grey. So introduce bi-values and bi-motivations. At the end of the day we are all just trying to keep a hold of what we value, and what we want (how motivated we are to get what we want though...)

Creates interesting arcs as, when the story develops, their values and motivations change. Or one changes but not the other.

A lot of the time these two coincide. 

 




 Understand. You won't get hired to be in the industry. You won't. Not a chance. There are a small handful of companies who hire dedicated writers, and, I'm sorry, you're not going to land a job straight away writing for Irrational Games.

Indie games though, that's the way to do it. But understand that every single writer, who doesn't know anything about *making* games and just wants to *write*, is trying to break into the indie scene in the same manner, it's super over-saturated.

Here's what I did:

write stories and write screenplays. Demonstrate you can write both prose and dialogue. If you can hand in a properly formatted screenplay (alla Celtx) all the better. I had a completed novel underneath me when I started to apply. It demonstrated I can stick to a task, and won't flake. It was also in decent condition, and I was pretty happy presenting it as the main part of my portfolio.

Get your hands on Unity or UE and learn basic game programming and modelling. Nothing heavy, just enough to understand how everything is working under the hood. Be aware what the rest of the team is doing, and, above all, understand the limitations of the medium and that *the story never, ever comes before gameplay*. If you can show that you have a basic knowledge of Java or a C language, or of art and model design, it again shows a willingness to learn and get involved. I'll tell you why this is important. I write big, I like big scenes that are incredibly cinematic, but I know they can't be made. I understand how the team are limited, by time (mostly) but also by the engine limitations and priorities; and making sure the game works comes before the story. If you are writing, and you understand that something won't work, you can save a lot of time and hassle by understanding that an idea won't work, and just hand in a more tame version.

I found work for an online gaming magazine, and wrote a few articles. Show dedication to the medium, show insight and passion. Again, a good portfolio helps for this.

Breaking in isn't easy, you really have to make yourself stand out.

I think that's everything...

  




 Would mostly look at books, and my own writing, as a way to keep me on track. Maybe mix in a few other things.

So I just wanted to ask what kind of things do you like to see on vlogs? If you watch booktube vlogs, what do you like about them, or dislike?

If you are a booktuber, any advice for a newbie?

Just looking for general advice and ideas from the community about what kind of things to include or exclude.

Thanks :) 




 Yeah, Antichrist is a different kettle of fish. It's something else entirely. But totally worth the watch. If you've seen his other films then you'll be ready for the blows that come, so it won't be too bad. It is though a really good film, and it's held together really well. 




 Lars Von Trier. 




 The dinosaurs aren't dead! They're on Atlantis!

Screw No Man's Sky and Ark. We need a supernatural, pirate, Dinosaur game. 




 Eh, get it in store. Try order from Tesco, etc? 




 It never struck be as being anti-religious for the sake of being anti-religious. I actually don't think it's a reflection on Christianity because Christianity didn't exist. It's an interesting idea about how the religion could have formed, and the new testament. Without it ever really being a bash at religion. It just removes the miracles and makes Jesus a normal man. Which I think is ok. 




 Neil Gaiman. Read his kid stuff, read his adult stuff, will read his comics when I can afford the entire set.

Also Philip Pullman. Love HDM. And I quite enjoyed 'The Good Man Jesus'. 




 Nymphomaniac. 




 Whenever I preorder from Game I put down a fiver, and then pay for the rest when I pick up the game...

Are you talking about online? 




 Ah, of course, so obvious. 




 Gotta ask why does it matter? 




 Atlantica. 




 *Pirate Asassin!*

What's more kickass than a *pirate assassin?!*

I swear to God if there were dinosaurs my tiny mind would have exploded. 




 You're asking for historical accuracy from a video game? 




 It was always there to help, in the bottom corner :) 




 "Hairy *baby*...hairy babeee*" 




 Sure. Look at the 'formatting help' at the bottom of the typy-window.

An asterisk on each side is *italics*. Two asterisks on each side is **bold** 




 Thanks for sharing those. They were great. 




 I would be quite interested in this. Had a look on the website you do film reviews too? Looking strictly for someone to do games because I would enjoy doing games and film. I've written game articles before, but not film. 




 I do my best to help =] 




 I have been known to do that myself. Waiting for something interesting to pop up I can put a comment on :) 




 Good luck. If you want to I'll read over what you've written (when you've written it.) 




 Sure. Just appreciate the ramifications of your protagonist expecting his younger sister to enjoy being raped. Sure, he doesn't understand, and the audience will get that. But you've still got to write it. As long as you don't dwell too heavily on it. Perhaps her screaming is him first realising something isn't right, it's not the same as all the other times. The catalyst for him to start panicking and *really* worrying about his sister. 

So phrase it as "something was wrong, this wasn't like the others times."

Than; "The others had liked, why didn't my sister, I thought she would like it."

Everything will be ok. 




 Writing my story, need to use italics, which is a simple ctrl + i away. But no, my stupid fingers put in an asterisk. Bad stupid fingers. 

Do we all spend too much time on Reddit?

Edit: Sorry I mussed up the heading. Missed out the 'you' dang it! 




 Then you lose his innocence. You can take it multiple ways. It's possible he's familiar with sex, but being familiar with the concept of rape could be a bit much.

I think that even if he understands what is happening it hinges on him not quite grasping why it's such a wrong with to do? Am I right? If he's just upset because his sister is crying, and in pain - that'll do. He doesn't quite understand *what* it is exactly that's causing that. He just understands its something bad. 

Maybe he does understand. But just think about what kind of an edge you want the scene to have. You can make it excruciatingly sharp if he's very innocent and doesn't understand. 




 Couldn't just do a repeat of a guy being eaten off the toilet... 




 Probably wouldn't understand rape. Just have to say he tied her up, she cried a lot, and he moved on top of her. The boy wouldn't know or understand any of the finer details. You would just have to be sort of vague, but in a sense that everything that was happening would make sense to the reader. It would just have to be all action. A very literal telling of what was occurring. 




 **The Golem's Eye, by Jonathan Stroud** 




 I wanna play... 




 Evolution? 




 It doesn't hurt. Really doesn't. Forearm might get a bit sensitive, especially after a while - and that'll make it sore. That's the worst of it.

As for tipping. I live in England, and we don't tip here. I wanted to once. But I'd been lying down for two hours, and shivering from the cold and having my ribs tattooed for two hours. I got up and I was woozy as anything. Forgot to give him more than he asked, because he did a fantastic job. 




 If you really want to throw everything and anything that matters to you out the window, sure. 

Social life. Friends. Family. Hobbies. No time for films. Or games. Or pets. Or relationships. Or reading. No job. No money. 

If you wanna live like Asimov and forsake the internet (and do all your research from thick encyclopedic tomes), that's fine. 

Today's world is ridiculously different from Asimov's. Difficult to compare. 




 To the contrary, holding down a blog would likely significantly boost your productivity towards a story.

Let's face it, you can't spend an entire day writing a story. You'll burn out, or get bored, inevitably procrastinate. But, rather than not be writing, you could be writing a blog post. This will break up your writing, going from story to blog and back. It'll keep you in the right frame of mind. As mentioned, if you work in tidbits about your novel (even just progress, anything you're struggling with) it'll keep you motivated and on point. You won't be working on the novel, but you'll be thinking about it. Kinda passively working on it - in a way. Having an audience might be significant boost to your writing as well. Keeping a blog is fun and an audience gives it a point to exist: if you're writing about your novel, that point to exist comes over to your novel. You're more motivated to work on it.

I hope that made sense. I'm sorry if it's all gibberish.

To summarise: keep blog, it will help. Focus less on it. 

Maybe update once a week. Don't write too much. You have to give yourself a break from your novel, nothing wrong with that. So put that break into a blog. Stull being productive. 




 I want you to know that I hate you.

(Read: I wish I was that talented) 




 No.

The original is perfect.

You're treading on hallowed ground... 




 Ooh me me me =]

Please give me an interesting/easy one :)

 Should be able to automatically insert it across the whole document. Rather than type it.

But I'm not sure how to do it on MS.

Click on insert in the toolbar, and it should be there, and ought to automatically insert it. Or try rich-clicking inside the footer and 'insert' or 'page numbers'. 

Sorry, I use Open Office. Haven't use Word for many years. 




 PM me the plot I might be interested. 




 What is this? 




 Hundreds of enemies? Now I'm sure that's exaggeration, but let me clarify three things: Time, money, space. If you want a large tattoo you're going to need all three. Sure, you can get a giant one on your back or chest. But anything like that could take god knows how many sessions which ups the price exponentially. 

Titan doing wall of dawn and the quote is fine. Just think about what you want and where, and what it might entail.

Also, don't forget you might not like the game when you're older. You really have to think about the future with a tattoo as niche as a gamer tattoo, and with as much detail as the one you want. 




 I have Advanced Warfare on XB1 - that's the same thing right? Run around and shoot guys?

Red Dead Redemption, Skyrim, Mass Effect and Brutal Legend (please!) ought to be added first. 




 Civ 5 




 New player. Only 3rd day playing Ukulele so any advice would be great.

The two I'm struggling with are: D, and Bm.

There isn't enough space on the neck to play the D chord, is there a more efficient way than using all three fingers? I'm always pushing one finger off the fret, so one string sounds muted.

Bm is just a pain in the ass, looking for hints and tips.

[This is what I'm learning to play](https://ukutabs.com/p/passenger/let-her-go/) 




 I imagine the term trilogy like the Von Trier trilogy. Or the *Cornetto* trilogy (Edgar Wright). Held together not by narrative but by something else - team, or director.  




 Gaming. I would go into gaming.

Probably programming.  




 [Lux Aeterna - Clint Mansell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLJllk-0o6c) (From *Requiem For a Dream*)

[Requiem - Mozart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zi8vJ_lMxQI) (This has a surprisingly good build-up and climax)

Mozart probably isn't what you're looking for. But Lux Aeterna is the most epic song I know.

 




 Haha no. Just straight up chat. Back in the days before Facebook. 'Cause Myspace was, lets face it, pretty naff. 




 It's an old logo they used to use back in ye olde days on MSN. It's a yellow emoticon smiling wearing shades - like a cool guy. 




 I think anyone who has seen *The Truman Show* has entertained the possibility that they are in their own version.

*(It's real)* 




 Good point, well made. I think it stands though. It's an oversight, a fairly large one.  




 I would say the portal was too small. Not enough gravity to get through. 




 I got that on Dayz. Tried to be nice. No luck. I even tricked a guy into thinking I was a friend - he had ammo I needed. I got close and killed him. There was a guy running on a desolate road, coming towards me. We stopped, stared at each other, neither making a move. He turned his back on me - judging me as not a threat - and I took him out from behind. Shit does that to you. Gotta survive. And then, when I had a really good character. Good weapons, plenty of ammo and food, someone took a lucky pot shot at me with a sniper rifle - never even saw them or the gun. Just *boom* black screen. Buh-bai good character. I later found my corpse. Picked clean. 




 Iron man falling.

In space. 




 I had a dream about a mouse. It was a really messed up dream. Let me give you some backstory - just a little. There were two mice, siblings, and their mother. I had been looking after these mice all day, but they kept on running away. My day had consisted of myself looking for these two tiny mice. Just the siblings. Sometimes I'd find them, and they'd get away again. I had to look after them, that was really important. When they were lost I had to find them.

I don't know what happened to the one. But I was with people, and they asked me if I was hungry. So they went and got fish 'n' chips while I sat on a wall, looking on the floor for two mice. I hadn't seen them for a long time - and I was very worried.

Eventually the others returned and they passed me a folded up paper bag. I opened it up and out popped this nose shape. A tiny mouse shaped nose. But it had been battered and deep fried - like a fish.

I know that sounds fucking stupid. But as this tiny orange nose-shape poked out it hit me that it was the mouse. And then it hit me again that someone had fucking deep fried it. Had probably boiled it alive and battered it. And then someone had given it to me. Knowing full well I was meant to look after them.

I forgot about it in the morning. In midday I was reminded, I nearly broke down into tears. 

I don't think I've just felt so...helpless, like I've ever lost something so totally, and failed so miserably. Just opening that bag and seeing that nose, and being hit by so many realisations. It really fucked me up. I still get sad about that mouse, sometimes.

(H) 




 Yeah, like I said. I had a feeling RDR would be one of the most requested. 




 Red Dead Redemption. Though I don't expect it will take long for that to happen.

Otherwise Skyrim (an obvious choice). Or Brutal Legend. Because I can't get enough Brutal Legend. 




 Finished it now. I did enjoy it. Parts of it were quite smart, and it was well put together. It was a bit slow, but that wasn't a problem really.

I read most everything. As much as possible. 




 Get a bow. Recurve or Composite. Much more need to practice and put time in. Much more rewarding. Bow is the same thing the whole time but bow is very different. 




 Archery...Just buy a cheap bow and a target. Sorted. 




 Thankyou, sir. I will try this out shortly. (Not that I can play yet but it's always fun =] ) 




 I'm English, and straight. But my sister (and her girlfriend) are gay. I just think America has done a really good thing here. A stellar step forward. I know it hasn't been easy in America but they've done it now. And that's really important. 




 I've already joined /r/ukulele :) I'm sure I will be spending a lot of time there over the coming days.

Do I wanna know on Ukulele? How do? 




 I'll get help. I really don't trust myself to do this. I have friends who are quite musically talented, they should be able to change a string.

Because even though I love my purple ukulele, I will get judged for it. :) Maybe not too keen to take it into the shop to get strung. 




 Might not be a good store. They do bass and guitar and Piano. They sell Ukes, but I've never seen strings :/. Might have to go into the city. And isn't that always fun?...

Also, I have no idea how to change strings. I probably should, I do not. Would definitely need help. Which I could feasibly get from the internet but that isn't the same. 




 Probably buy nylon. That's what they usually are right?

So in all likelihood I'll wander into shop and buy whatever I am recommended. 

I have no idea what I'm doing :/ 




 Yep, I read the reviews. Best advice given was to get new strings. Ones that aren't goddamn plastic. I'm already picking up Jason Mraz's I'm Yours. Same four chords over and over haha. It's just so difficult to learn because it doesn't sound right because the strings sound awful.  




 You mean...that's a thing? 




 Haha. No, unfortunately it was the very boring E string.  




 I mean...my bass is ok. My bass is broken because my friend snapped a string while tuning it so he lent me his. So, even though I'm not playing it. My bass is nice. Just...needs new strings... 




 Yay! I've really wanted to learn to play for ages so I just though...Sod it, buy one!

So I bought the cheapest one Amazon and it just arrived. It's bright purple (which is kinda awesome), and the strings are plastic and shit - but hey, I got what I paid for (less than 20). So, if I stick at it, I'll go and buy some decent strings. And if I really stick at it, I'll buy a decent one and really go for it. For now I'm letting the strings rest (apparently they need a bit of stretching after tuning), so I'm gunna leave it alone for now and see how if it sounds any better later on. Whoot. Back to learning 'Do I Wanna Know' on bass.

Edit: it's really strange going from tuning a ukulele to tuning a bass...Like, *I have to stretch now!? This neck suddenly seems so long!* 




 JUST DO IT!

 The themes and ideas are great. I totally appreciate them, and what he was trying to say. But just...everything else missed it for me. 




 Yeah, that's the thing about Fahrenheit 451. It's pretty universally loved.

I just didn't like the writing or the execution. He had a great setting and a really good idea and it just...felt like he didn't do anything with it. But I think if I read it again I would appreciate it more. I went in I think expecting something different, so if I read it with my head in the right place I might enjoy it more. 




 Fahrenheit 451... 




 POKEMON!

The original version in the nineties, when there were 150 *good* Pokemon and that was it. 

Or it could have Beauty and the Beast. I would have been super young. 




 I don't think anyone else would go with it so well. 




 fowl fowles fowl fowle 




 To be fair, what else would I mix it with?

Two of my favourites. Fuck yeah! 




 Songs a bit loud, can't really hear your bass line. Video looked awesome though, good production values.

Is this song difficult? I've wanted to learn it but for some reason I've never got round to it (...contemplative silence...) 




 Coke. Coke is the sweet nectar of the Gods.

But also: Budweiser/Captain Morgan's. (Depends if I'm in a lager or rum mood)

I dunno the last one. 




 Don't blame the devs blame the publishers don't blame the devs blame the publishers 




 Erm, didn't you see "A Series of Unfortunate Events."

Tsk. 




 On the morning the last Lisbon daughter took her turn at suicideit was Mary this time, and sleeping pills, like Theresethe two paramedics arrived at the house knowing exactly where the knife drawer was, and the gas oven, and the beam in the basement from which it was possible to tie a rope.  




 Thus, another issue with the elite controller. The controls do seem to be able to be ported towards PC, but look built for console. I don't know what they'll decide. Other than recommending a controller. Which, obviously, doesn't suit everyone. 




 Generally the aim of a thing. If things are generally seen as high culture - such as books. That's so. However something done solely for the pursuit of money regardless of any art...

Maybe that doesn't declassify from high culture. Maybe it does. 

Same for anything. Film sequels made for bullshit money. Films are high culture, but are also art. 

I don't care who likes what. I don't have anything against twilight, or erotic fiction in general. If something is done for a purpose, great. If something is done for money, then it ought not be culture at all.

Yes, I've opened myself up to a lot of backlash. I know that's a flawed argument. I would rather support a low end-indie film like 'Ink' than a blockbuster film made-for-money like 50SOG. 




 Tyrannosaur. Heavy Scottish. Also a great film. I would link to the trailer but they removed dialogue and made it musical for the exact reason that international audiences couldn't understand it. 




 I guess with full controller support. I heard them saying that you would use the 'silver' button the XB1 controller - which is referring to the Elite controller. I hope it doesn't rely on you having that. That's a damned nuisance expense if it is.  




 These days high culture is mostly anything that isn't reality TV. Some people might exclude TV altogether. 

Mostly theatre. Some films (especially in cinema). Most books.  




 Didn't bother me as much in DA:I. I mean the first time I encountered them it was a dark cave and my fire spell illuminated the outline of a giant spider and I was like "fuck...get to the back, get to the back..where's my team!" Not a fun time. 

After that it was ok. I don't know why fantasy has such a hard-on for giant spiders. Like in Skyrim when that giant spider falls from the ceiling in one of the first story missions. FuckyouBethesda. 




 Entertaining books are high culture.  




 I can't work out if you're defending poor grammar or the book...

Hmm? 




 This grammar is typical of someone who read that grammatically illiterate piece of shit book.

That's my problem with it.

Books should be high culture. Not reality-TV-level bullshit. 
























 Moderately. I'm not working at the moment and I'm spending all my time writing, which is what I love. That could change at any moment. 




 Pretty sound advice. 




 Tell me your secrets to ultimate happiness! 




 A black market, hey...?
Hmm... 




 Man, I'm just not a big music person. I tend to not buy music and just listen to the odd soung on Youtube. This feels like such a good time to get into his music though. 




 Anything that isn't a text book or a diary. Something...designed to be written in.

Fiction, and non-fiction and poetry books. Really anything that's must to be consumed, should stay in a good state. 

I know people really don't agree with this. But I hate the idea of defacing one of my books. I don't even dog-ear them. 




 I'm so jealous that you've seen him. He is the kind of guy you just know straight off is fucking amazing to see live.

Now *that's* pressure! 




 *Backs away slowly*

Just kidding. I will do. It's a booktube thing, don't know if that sounds interesting. But if you're still interested =] 




 Thanks :)

Well I'm planning on uploading it tomorrow...if I can bring myself to do it. 




 Unsure on the rules. Does that count as self-promotion? Is such a thing allowed?

I mean, obviously the point is to start a conversation, but... 




 Oh this thread hurt me bad.

Talking about Harry Potter events - and not talking about the books.

Oh, calling it *The Sorcers Stone*. That just makes me feel icky.  




 My heart stopped a little bit then.

Write in one of my books. The idea strikes me as sacrilege.  




 Didn't what a playstation but knew how to run a simulator on a PC.

When I had my first PC it was still on dial-up. We used to have a farm game that played the song "B-I-N-G-O". If you know/remember that song. 

I was so happy when I got a playstation. 




 Yes. It was *'The Way of Shadows'* by Brent Weeks. It was two-for-one so I got the sequel as well.

Now my favourite genre to read and to write is fantasy. It's had quite a big effect on me. 




 You, m'lady, are a saint of the highest order :)

 Well the opinion bleeds over into the film. So I guess by putting it in this sub it is preemptive. 

If this film bombs (or she does do what she does in the books) and everyone hates it, I want people to come back to this thread. 




 Yeah, the entire scheme is flawed as fuck. Very much to the point of it being nonsensical. 

I like this idea that they're trying to paint the government as being all-powerful and totally evil. When...no...not really. The only bad thing is the Hunger Games - which is apparently the only governmental thing the actual government do.  




 That was a call for an example, actually.

 




 I'm mad about the scene in the book. 

The thing is, that is the *worst* trilogy I've ever read. And I've read Twilight. The Hunger Games is a good book. Catching Fire and Mockingjay are both totally, absolutely abysmal. So some of that hatred bleeds over into the films. 

I'm not mad at the films. Catching Fire was a good film. I'm against splitting the third book in two because *it's absolutely fucking awful, and* nothing *happens*. So the third film wasn't the best. But I'm waiting to see what they do with the third one. They've maintained a fair level with the films so I think it's only fair of me to expect the finale to be not totally awful. 




 The only thing you will regret is not having bought it sooner.
 




 I've never come across anything that would show me otherwise.  




 Never played that one. Though I hear good things.  




 I'm pretty happy with as it is, thanks. I trust that your changes will finalise it now :)  




 Titanfall had giant robots. COD might be doing better than it, but that's purely because the game already has a solid fanbase. Possibly (assuming here) made of pre-teens who don't really know a lot else about gaming so they stick to it. 

Team Fortress 2. That's a solid example of an FPS done right. I also quite liked Evolve. I know that isn't *quite* the same. But running around and hunting a giant monster is far better than running around and hoping you can start shooting someone before they start shooting you. 




 What conclusions have I arrived at? What misconceptions?

 




 [Thoughts?](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-HBW-hPttDh5imuTNrDepA) 




 AW is a touch better but is still at it's core: run around firing your gun. And...AW shifted the format a bit and they added verticality. But they were too late to the verticality game because Titanfall was all over that. So at it's core it's still COD just with a pinch of Titanfall, and a smidgen of the power-ups from Halo 3. Which...isn't enough. 




 If it helps you can find size templates online :/ 




 If meat (red and white) forms a dietary staple, then...yeah. Need it to be kinda healthy. And sure you can replace it with pills, but those won't carry you through the same way.

It's not a matter of cooking. Well I should include pasta. I'll let you have that. I'm just not fond of veggies. 

I'm pretty sure that ethics is by its very definition without facts. Ethics and morals mean something entirely different for two different people. I mean, anything can aim to make a claim factual, that doesn't make it a genuine fact. I would on principle disagree with anyone or anything who tried to convince me I had to bend my beliefs to suit what they have decided. 

Are you implying we should be spoon fed our morals and ethical beliefs? Sure, some of what we take is given to us by our societies and we take that, we don't have a choice with that. Everything else we're pretty much left to decide for ourselves. 




 What do you think? [Clickity](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-HBW-hPttDh5imuTNrDepA) 




 *Now?* Try four versions ago. 




 I mean, isn't meat pretty healthy. Not in vast quantities, and not processed. But aren't they dietary staples? Also, meat is the only thing that even tastes half decent.

Quantum physics(well, any science) /= ethics. My own opinions and ethics and morals I'm quite happy to decide by myself. And, just as a result of life, those things will change for me, that's just what happens. People I meet might change them, opinions are meant to be flexible. But at least I'm not being spoon fed everything I ought to decide by myself.

 




 That uploaded beautifully :).

Would it be possible to make adjustments? If you don't want to I'm perfectly happy with it as it is, 'cause it's great, just a few things don't look entirely right.

Feel free to tell me to piss off :) 




 Torturing something and eating something are totally different things. One is unnecessary, the other sustains life. That's all the food chain is. We don't torture the animals when we kill them - is that what you're getting at? 

I think contemplating issues in our own intellectual vacuum is probably healthier than being spoon-fed morals.

:) 




 Might might not make right. But thousands of years of evolution to shove us at the top of the food chain kinda mebbi does. 

Do I need an entire ethics committee to tell me what is wrong and right now? 

Sorry, I think you're going to read that and it comes off a bit harsh, that's not how it was intended. 




 The thing about splitting movies into two started with *The Deathly Hallows*. Which by all rights was a super long book and could have done with being split into two.

Mockingjay is a terrible book and nothing happens and doesn't need splitting into two. I disagree with it.  




 I'm glad I saved you the pain.

Well actually. Catching Fire is a horrendous book but a fairly good movie. The films are actually better than the books, so hopefully the final final one won't be that bad. 




 Well, when the third one comes out. It will have spoilt the whole movie for me then. 




 I don't have any controversial, but I do have *The Host, by Stephanie Meyer*. That would certainly get questioned. 




 Hey, thanks for this I really like it :). Unfortunately YT is saying the file is too big, I've tried fixing it but it hasn't worked. I'm unsure what the problem is.  




 Spiderman 2. Or the original Spiderman game on PS1. Both of these games were boss. They can't be beaten.  




 Why would someone call a swat team on a person, just because they got their arse kicked over a video game! 




 DA:I, yeah, was a colossal disappointment.

Don't worry, Withcer 3 is nothing like it.

The feel of Skyrim and TW3 are nothing alike. TW3 is much heavier, much more demanding. Both storywise and gameplay wise. But the worlds are equivalently epic and comparable. 

Just yeah...Get The Witcher 3. If you like high fantasy, especially TES, you'll love this. Also, you should play TW2, not to play TW3, just because it too is an awesome game. 




 Didn't check out the blog, but...Are you writing fanfiction? 




 I know. But that's my point. You can't say you love animals, but then only mean the cute ones. 




 That's heavy man. Real shit. I'm sorry you got stuck in such a bad situation. But the advice everyone has given you is the best. Leave her. I know it's hard, but it's that simple. 




 We are humans. We fucking earned our place to be able to eat meat. Don't feel guilty for it, it's extremely normal. 

The hypocritical thing to do would be to say you love all creatures, and then include the bi-line^aslongasthey'recute. Which is what most everyone does. "I love all creatures. (except Angler Fish, fuck those things)."

Nothing wrong with eating meat. And in fact nothing wrong with being a vegetarian. Just be comfortable with your choices. 




 I was raised a catholic, attended wholly catholic schools, and was confirmed into the religion as a teenager.

I don't believe in God. 

I don't think that God is important as a figure that *exists*. But just as something to put your faith in. To give the feeling of something bigger than yourself, that exists outside of you. It's a comfort. And, even as an atheist, I think churches, mostly, are great things - when done right. Their the only real figure that promotes peace, love and charity on any scale, I think, societally, that's important.

I'm an existentialist, I prefer to think I'm guiding my own life. 




 **MAD END OF HUNGER GAMES SPOILERS**

[Spoilers](#s "Not so much in the film (though I expect the upcoming film will replicate it) but in the book. They take over the capital *and she chooses to place the capital kids into a last hunger games.* Why? Fucking spite. Despite her sheer PTSD, her loathing of the capital borne *purely from* the hunger games. *nope, fuck it, into the Hunger Games you go you little innocent shits.* And, let's face it, that entire book is fucking terrible anyway.") 




 Ah I've come across Codecademy before. I could never stick to anything, so well done for doing it. I know coding isn't easy, so that's certainly something to pat yourself on the back for doing. By which I mean go out and celebrate!

 I'm not inherently against pre-orders, so this seems like a good idea. It's a bit of a gimmick though, convincing more people to pre-order because *you might the be one pre-order who pushes the group to the next bonus*. It's heavy sales tactics and manipulation which I'm against. 




 NIGHTCRAWLER NIGHTCRAWLER

Because they set up the romance with beast, rather than Azazel so... 




 It would be for me haha. I rarely exercise. And not if it can be otherwise avoided. 




 That is true. A day can't go wrong when it's headed by a decent sandwich :) 




 I think I'd have died about four days ago if I was considering even doing that. 




 I came across something which is a great way of measuring classics. Which is to compare it to the things that were out when it was published. The Catcher in the Rye was the first of it's kind, and whilst I don't think it's aged well, it certainly is/was deserving of it's classic status.

But you've actually hit on the reasons why the book is a good one. 

 he spends the entire book whining about how his life and choices are all some one else's problem.

Because he doesn't want to face responsibility. He doesn't want be an adult, as he says; a phony.  He isn't, as a character, meant to have a redeeming feature. That is his character. And yeah, nowadays, it's not very interesting, but *that is his character.* He's stuck in a loop. Stuck between being a teen, and being an adult, that's why he wants to be *The Catcher in the Rye*. 

John Green explains it better. If you want to get anything out of the book, [watch this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R66eQLLOins) 




 You just know it's just bound to be a good day then.  




 Glad to hear it's a nice day. Have fun on your killer bike ride :) 




 I'm waiting for a phone call about whether or not I get to write the screenplay for a short film. *fingers crossed*. 




 That sounds like a pretty decent day! I can't see Ted 2 till the 7th :( 




 My day is pretty good. Best of all I'm waiting for a phone call from a guy who hopefully wants to hire me as a scriptwriter on his short story project. I want that job! 




 Try Smite. 




 try /r/suggestmeabook 




 Hey everyone, how's everyone's day going? Great, I hope =D 




 Yeah, it's not an easy read at parts. Probably not something I'd come back to either. But it's worth reading, just the once, I reckon. 




 I have a lot of favourite quotes. But the one I have tattooed on me, which is absolutely one of my favourites is *"So it goes."* by Kurt Vonnegut, from Slaghterhouse-5.

I just think that it's a fantastic principle to believe in. 




 Purists who've read every single comic book will never be happy with the film. 

People who dislike superhero films, and just pass them off as CGI-laden utter shit, will downvote them.

People who want to be hipster and dislike anything mainstream - yes, this actually happens - will downvote it.

It takes a certain kind of anything to be liked totally by the masses. Not even Harry Potter had the luxury of ensnaring *everybody*.  




 I've never had any issues with it. Does the job for me. My university lecturers said to get Final Draft as well, which, when a free version does the exact same job, to the exact same level, is ridiculous, and probably a touch elitist. These are the same people who also said to use FCPX over FCP7.

Yes, I use FCP as well, not Avid. I'll let you have that one. Avid really is the industry standard. 




 As a film, I think the idea is great. The execution of the first movie though was horrendous. We have a whole *city* full of *thousands/millions of people* who can do *literally anything*. 

But no, fuck that, here's the inside of a very boring house for two hours whilst the interesting things - *which clearly are not going to happen inside the house* - are occurring outside.  




 Happy I could help :) 




 Celtx does the job. Does it the exact same. Minus that needless fair chunk of change. 




 Get Celtx, it's free. It does the formatting for you. There will be tutorials online about where to put the formatting. How to introduce scenes and transitions.

Also, check out some professional, hollywood screenplays. Some are quite easy to find as PDF's via a google search. Always best to have a look at one, and gain an understanding that way before you sink your teeth in. 




 It ain't worth shit until we can play in it. And, lets face it, we can't. Those are pretty pictures. But they aren't game worlds. 




 I watched the movie yesterday. Hadn't seen it in a number of years. Damn, it is a really good movie! 




 Some of them are good, and some of them are just hella bland. I was watching a new one the other day and I was giggling madly.

Favourite character...eh....Why not Ralph? *"My cat's breath smells like cat food".

Yours? 




 What episode of the simpsons? Old episodes of the Simpsons *especially* the original Treehouse of Horror episodes are, hands down, the shit. 




 You can get a sample of the first few chapters on Amazon. I recommend reading through them. I did, I loved it, was amazing. 




 This is old, but also very good :) 




 New to the sub so not sure if this is within the rules, or what normally happens, but...can I request an entirely new cover art? I don't have anything to build it on, so it would have to be from scratch. You would of course be credited.

The channel is called: British Book Guy

Im British and it's a booktube channel. :)

Really it only needs to be simple, just the name in front of something british like the Union Jack or St. Georges Cross, with a cup of tea or something. Like I said, full creative control.

The recommended size is: 2560 x 1440

Apologies if this is unorthodox. And thanks either way :) 




 I would save it. Sustain myself through unemployment a bit longer. 




 A PS4 might be worth the investnment in the long run. There's already great games out there like Bloodborne, and more are due to come it's way. If you want to invest in a PS4 now isn't a bad time.

Destiny isn't a bad game, the online is fairly tight. If you want to play with your friends, do so. 




 Gotta sell copies. Gotta reach a wider market. Appeal to a larger demographic. 




 Will try this thanks. I just wasn't too eager to start yanking the strings I just put in. Do not trust my handiwork in the least, going to have to wait a week to be able to play without expecting to get a string twanging in my eye. But will definitely try to do this =] 




 Ron Jeremy? 




 Coming around the same time as the legalisation of gay marriage in the *entire* USA, I think this is a time for the LGBT community to celebrate, not complain. Really, not a week to complain. 




 Hey man, thanks, that's a great answer. Pretty happy to know the best way is to play it, that's what I really wanted to hear :) 




 I humbly await to see the thread :) 




 Are we going to do this the other way? God knows there weren't a few thousand questions I would have loved to anonymously asked a grown-up when I was a teenager.  




 So do I. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't half expecting them to snap off the first time I played them. Not sure how much I ought to trust my handiwork. :) 




 I expect it is. And I also expect that I would really enjoy astronomy, and looking through a telescope, and learning about all the different things from Earth's viewpoint. But I also like my documentaries. 




 There is UE and Unity. But those won't be easy or simple to learn. If you want to pick one, I recommend Unity. It programs physics for you. 

If you want to get serious about gaming, those are the way to go. If you only want to make the one scene, then go with something easier, as previously mentioned. 




 RPG maker.

Roblox. 

Something equally inane like that. 




 The thing about astronomy is that I don't really see it is as anything much more than looking at tiny white dots, and remembering constellations. The only thing worth seeing with the naked eye is Andromeda. (Did you know you can see an entirely different galaxy with the naked eye? How goddamn awesome is that!?). I think there might be more to astronomy than that, but not for me. I like finding out new things, and finding out what quasars are, and what causes some stars to go supernova and some not to, and to see nebulae, and to compare our star to bigger stars, and our galaxy to other galaxies.   




 Whoo! It was a Ukulele which it was pretty new. It took me about an hour to *learn* how to do it. Countless videos and instructions. And then about another hour just to actually get it down. But now Yeah! it's done. Feeling pretty happy and proud with myself. Can't wait to start playing it tomorrow to hear the difference the new, and vastly better strings, will make :)

In other news, I'm now being plagued by a particularly large moth. Dammit. 




 I've spent an ungodly amount of time watching and re-watching space documentaries. I know a lot about space. 




 Whether or not the top starts to fall isn't important, because GET THIS:

*The top wasn't Cobbs totem*

This isn't my own theory, this is one from the internet...

The totem was his wedding ring. Now we know the Top was Mal's totem to begin with. But at the beginning of the film exposition-Arthur explained that anybody else knowing anything about a person's totem negates it. *But Mal is dead* you say? Well, she isn't. Not to Cobb. Who constantly sees her to the point she is the antagonist of the movie. The top being Cobbs totem totally negates it's existence.

But, for the shrewder ones among you, they will have noticed Cobbs ring. In the dream, he is wearing it. Outside of the dream, he isn't. In the ending scene, he isn't. The top doesn't decide it at all.

In fact Nolan has said that the top wobbling at the end isn't anything to do with the dream or not. It's to do with how little Cobb now gives a crap about the dream, the dream-world and his past life. 




 Hey, so, first time I've ever changed strings (yay). I don't even wanna mention how long *that* took. But anyway...So from what I've heard the strings will keep on popping out of tune, and that's fine. At what kind of time will that *stop* happening? So if it continues for longer than it ought to I can probably but it down to the strings being buggared (my own fault).

Also, so the strings need to stretch. Should I give them a while to get used to being stretched, even a little bit? Should I wait until tomorrow to play on them? Or are they good to go - just be prepared to keep on tuning them?

Any other advice or tidbits I missed out which are important? Thanks guys. 




 Because they were both living one life. I think it's just part of the narrative that maintains that they are the same person. They live each others lives, and do each others jobs. It just reinforces that they are the same person. 




 Honestly I haven't read them in years. But I do remember thoroughly enjoying them. 




 The second incarnation of Spider-Man since *that* Venom, and in Marvel's hands? They won't hesitate. 




 They were going to use Giamatti yeah. He might not have been the best, but that suit was excellent.

I don't know about Venom. I'm sure Marvel won't waste any time putting him in there somewhere.  




 Yes, I did. I thought it was a pretty decent film. He's a good actor, and he did well in Jurassic World too. 




 I think they're aiming for October, but it might be a bit later than that. I'm honestly not 100% sure. We have been greenlit on steam, so keep an eye out for it :) 




 They've done a really good job with the game. I have to say. I can't speak for the story, but the game is impressive as hell.  




 You should watch the whole video. It's all on YT or failing that on their own website. Just anything by Neil Gaiman is amazing. Also watching his 2012 commencement speech. It you're not *bleeding* inspiration by the end of it there is no hope for you. 




 I'm working on two. The first one is pretty much done. It's coming out in a few months (excited squeals). Look it up: *Anomaly 1729*

The second is a bit less developed, and is so much work 

How's your game coming along? 




 My instructor was twenty minutes late for the lesson I was meant to have before my test. That lesson was the first time we had done an 'emergency stop', which turned up in the test. It was a fucking shambles. 

Passed first time though :) 




 Fight Club...what?  
























 This is actually a great story. Not because it's good, and I'm sorry it happened. But...what an exchange. 'Fuck you.' 'Fuck you.'

My aunt was in Chicago and she had her handbag snatched, she chased after him screaming for her passport and, nice of him, he stopped, took it out and threw it for her. He got everything else. But at least she could come home. 




 True. But I don't think to an incredibly vast expense. 

I think too many developers is going to hit the developers hardest, though. Which they should bear in mind. 




 Been writing for ten years. Spent four years writing and editing a novel, got rejected a few dozen times, and then realised it was shit.

Trying to push out some shorts and poems whenever possible.

Working on next novel. About 25k words in. 




 Doesn't matter how many people use Unity or UE, not that many people are going to be able to put out games. 




 Have to say, I agree. These films are excellent.

Skadoosh. 




 Open Office, on the other hand, is absolutely free. And does the exact same thing to the exact same quality. 




 I recommend the Ukulele over the guitar. I've been playing for about two weeks and can play four songs. I've been playing Bass on and off for years, and can only just about play three songs.

Also, the ukulele is just the most fun instrument to play. It's so non-serious, and that's great.

I got my Ukulele for 16 off Amazon, which is nothing. 




 Well spotted. Good game? I do kinda want to buy it. 




 If you're just remember you have just as many oscars as Leonardo Dicaprio.

If that doesn't work, just imagine a T-rex making a bed.

 




 Fuckin' Borderlands 2. Christ - speak about *too* long. 




 Yeah, you need a team. You need a whole team and a flawless strategy. You need to be a better gamer than anyone thought possible. Yeah, that's just for local(ish) tournaments. 




 I think she does bat them off quite quickly by hiding behind the cop's failures, so the FBI don't want to press her too hard. The evidence as it is does add up. But that book was pretty flawed anyway.

She wanted her dead body to wash up on the shore. Great, which would *absolutely* prove that he didn't do it. Fatal flaw in the plan was to not just disappear! Throwing herself off a boat would never have worked. 




 Also, sorry, just popped over to Booksie. That is not a good looking website. It looks strange, it's not as presentable as it could be, and your stories don't feature as prominently as they should.

I would recommend moving over to Wattpad (which is a much more recognised name). Or even Figment. 

(also, you trust a site that let's anyone print off your entire manuscript without any qualms?) 




 Promote harder. Never stop promoting. Find new ways to promote. Build on old ways to promote. Promote yourself, build up your social media presence, keep people coming back for more. Not the material, it's the coverage. Use other writing sites, too. Put up samples, and then link to a single, main account (which seems like Booksie in your case) and drag them in that way.

Also, having things online doesn't stop them being published. Of course, you'll have to take them down. But no one would forgo a piece of writing because it was on the internet. I've seen a lot of people have that concern, and a lot of people have replied, stating their fears are unfounded. Don't worry :) 




 The thing about Patreon is that without an audience who does care, you just come off as a money-grabbing asshole. And you don't want that. As mentioned, build up an audience first. Which can take time but will work in the end. There are people out there who write serial novels on wordpress and make a living out of it.

Come up with a great idea, keep at it, keep the momentum going on wordpress as you build up a decent audience. And then, when you have a fair amount of readers, bam! money please :) 




 The whole point - which is explained in the novel (sorry) - is that she traps him. That, even though her original plan didn't work out, she totally won still. Eventually her 'fake-death', and "rape", were just byproducts of the fact that, eventually, she still has him totally trapped. 




 If you're definitely going to change your story vastly, then making as resolute an outline of the changed version as possible. You want to make the merger as streamlined as possible. It depends if you want this new draft to resemble the original at all, or not. If you do want to, then just write an outline of changes. Otherwise go full draft.

I've never rewritten something from scratch no. I spent three years writing my novel no way I was going to rewrite the damn thing. But I did spend a year editing it.

You have to be aware of the limitations of your novel. You don't want to spend the next two years reworking this, if you would benefit more from moving on to something else. That's what I had to tell myself. After a year of editing, the novel wasn't getting any better, into the drawer with it. It's definitely something worth doing, rewriting the novel. But give yourself a doable time-frame, and don't ever extend it. Stick to it like your life depends on it.  




 I am also fine with this word. I like words that aren't in the dictionary, they're the best. Stabby, that's the word I made up today. I had to describe a sharp stone with certain qualities: stabby. 




 It would be remiss of me not to share my favourite meme of all time.

[I promise, this is the last one](http://imgur.com/RisOcxl) 




 Hard to say. It's probably worth drafting up a secondary version now, and then distancing yourself from both. As you go through your main, written copy, after your month break, you can compare the written events to the secondary events, and get a feel of how it works out in that scene.

That is what you asked isn't it? 




 I like to be at least slightly resourceful when it comes to memes and gifs :) 




 This worked out quite well.

[Just one more gif :)](http://gfycat.com/LikelyHappyAmericanavocet) 




 Those are my two tips for cheering up. The first is that, whenever you're feeling down, always remember you have just as many Oscars as Leonardo DiCaprio. 

The other is the T-Rex thing, perfectly demonstrated in gif form. Which I will cherish forever. 




 Spain. France. Greece. Malta.

If I live in England, I guess Wales and Scotland count.... 




 Here's a gif of a t-rex trying to make a bed someone made for me:

[Clickity](http://i.imgur.com/sKjhQ6G.gif)

They were asking for ideas to cheer up and I said I always imagine a T-rex trying to make a bed. It worked, and they made a gif of it for me. And I thought it was genius. 




 I'm sorry, it was meant to be a joke :( My bad for not making it a very good one. 




 Don't think I'm being too serious. It's common superstition that it's bad luck to talk about Christmas, or sing Christmas songs when it's not Christmas, that's all.   




 Dude, it's like July. I can't imagine the kind of Sin, Bad-Karma, bad-luck/misfortunate you'll get for invoking the name Christmas.

-makes a cross using fingers, backs away slowly- 




 Because they already have an excuse for elitism: PCmasterrace.

I'm not just bashing on PC. I'd disagree with anyone who blindly proclaims one console over another. It annoys me when people say get a PS4 purely for the graphics. That ain't logic. 

And I know not every single PC player is like that. But I have seen a god awful amount of threads asking about preference towards consoles, and on *every single one* someone pops up and says "PCmasterrace".  




 Because there are different people. 

One is someone who calmly explains the benefits of each system, and why, perhaps, the PC is a better choice, if the asker is so inclined.

Then there are the people who blindly bash away at people who have asked what console to have, spouting mindlessly to get a PC, without any real reason why. The kind of people who don't make cases logically, just blindly declare PC is best for them, and therefore everyone.

Also because, for a post asking about consoles, you have to take a step back and say "Yeah, consoles are great, but have you thought about a PC, here's why..."

They don't do that. If they did that I would be fine with it. It's just when they spout *"Get a PC"*. 




 We want proof that the underdog can beat the man.

"We learned to root for the underdog because we see ourselves in them".

Add in a post-apocalyptic setting and you've got it.

 




 Well, when you put it like that... 




 Obviously as PC gamers they don't have anything interesting to say so they just bash on consoles.  




 Being as it won't be about Joel or Ellie. I doubt it. Trust Druckmann.  




 No, I was saying that shortcuts and roundabouts don't exist. Not that simply writing was a shortcut. The opposite. There is no easy way.

It's funny how all of these workshops and writing schools have popped up at just the right moment to serve the hundreds of people who want to be writers. How did every single writer before the 21st century manage without attending a seminar on writing? 

 




 Fuck, I'm sick of these posts. Not only are there hundreds of them *on this thread alone* there is always the inevitable answer from a goddamn PC-playing elitist telling you to get a PC. 




 Men do not care. We just don't.  




 I just don't tell any of my family I write. My friends aren't readers, or writers, so they don't really care. So I miss out a lot of these steps :) 




 It is commercial, and I know of authors who have recognised that and entered the market for purely financial reasons, but I don't think this is the case for all writers. 

Once something gets popular, say, Twilight, a lot of people try to emulate that success, so we get a market saturated with emo vampires. Now Meyer, who is the most successful, isn't to blame here (except for Breaking Dawn). The original trilogy was fine, and she, as a previous author, wasn't just writing for the money (except Breaking Dawn). Those that came after her, copying her, did. 

Otherwise, you are perfectly correct. 




 I think that a lot of trilogies are born from an original thought: What if kids were made to fight in an arena to the death? What if kids were made to run a maze for [twist, twist, twist] reasons. What if there was a society of people who had surgery to make them beautiful at 16? 

All of these taglines on their own are pretty awesome. And they stand up as solid novels. But the tagline doesn't extend to the sequels. So they has in a sub-plut (post-apocalypse - evil government, post-apocalypse - evil government, post-apocalypse - evil government)+ and that's how it plays out for the rest of the sequels

+I didn't choose all three of us because they embodied those theme. I chose them because I have read them all, they just so happen to have the same *freaking* antagonist!  




 Inception! 




 Structure is sitting down every day at a certain time and writing. 

This is a craft, it's art. There is no shortcut to getting better, no trick or roundabout way. There is only one: to write. Everything else is...arbitrary. Except reading. 

Look up what everybody's advice is about how to get better at writing. It's not to enhance your vocabulary (which is a side-effect of reading widely and reading well), it's not to read as many 'how-to-write' books as possible (9/10 of which are BS scams anyway). It's to read and to write. That's it.

You want a goal? 500 words a day. If you can put in more time, go for higher. I try and write a thousand. If I'm feeling good, I can pump that out in an hour. Then I move onto my scripts, or writing my games. If I do all that - back to my novel.

You might benefit more from books on writing than I do, I've always found them a waste of time; purely because I could be writing instead. 




 The technique and ideas for editing have already been pretty thoroughly laid out by others, so here's my two cents.

Traditional publishing and self-publishing are nothing even remotely alike. Don't throw yourself at one or the other. Research and research and research thoroughly. Written accounts, agents accounts, testimonials. Everything, for both sides.

As it stands you have to have a super duper amount of faith in the project to pay someone to work on it. 

Even more pertinent: you don't have to worry about any of this until the book is finished. Nothing else matters till then. 

Good luck :) 




 Back in my day, haha. What an expression. 




 Knowing all the words, and being intimate with all the fiction in the world, won't make you a better writer. Only writing will. 

Your plan should read more like:

* 7 Days writing
* Read in the evenings
* Submit through the evenings. 




 No point on lingering on it. Our fears didn't come true. Everything is far happier returning to how things were, than lamenting on how things could have been. 




 Ask her friends. :) 




 A lot of companies publish all their financial statistics, you just have to rummage around their website long enough to find the boring part. A lot of companies are owned by others, so it's worth finding out who their parent company is first.  




 "wroters?"

Typo, or...?

There are websites for writing, where you can upload your writing and others can read it. But a lot of these also include forums for various things. Check out Figment and Wattpad. 




 Speedrunners. So much speedrunners.

Also Team Fortress 2.

 




 Everything you're going to try and do will be to improve it. It's going to change a lot of in editing either way.

I think the best thing to do would be to summarise the plot in bullet points, and then create a list of events that you would change, and then see which one you prefer, which you hate. Once you can see an overview of the new canvas you might see how much you like, or dislike, the new version. 

If it changes that's fine, so long as all the changes are for the best. Of course at this stage it might be good seeking other people's opinions, because if you're unsure how to move forward on your own it's always worth just getting a second opinion :) 




 It needs to attach itself to Parker. All of it's traits are from him. That's the reason he so resembles a spider, why he can do something that resembles web-slinging, and wall-crawling. 




 My first long-term relationship.

But hey, it first-time relationships aren't for fucking up I don't know what they're for.

Note to self: Find someone who actually gives even a slight shit about your life-goal. 




 More than like haha. It has quickly gone on to my list of all time favourite things ever. 




 Just what I need, another depressing song.


-Merrily plods off to listen to the song- 




 [sent later than it should have been due to there being too much laughter to type.] 

Yea, I needed that. That was amazing. 




 That's not a bad idea. 




 It wasn't bad, by any stretch. I just found the first half of her life more interesting than the second. Which isn't a reflection on Gainsbourg, because I think she's great. Just that portion of her life was more interesting than when she joined up with that guy and just started torturing people.  




 That's what I thought. You've had lots of practice. 




 Would you be interested in starring in my screenplay, Mr. Cruise? It's about a guy who has to run away from things. I feel like you would be the best person for the job. 




 There is a cost, that's why I have to ask.

I'm a writer. I'm writing a novel, and I'm working hard on it. I'm writing a short film, and I'm writing for some indie game developers as well. I'm doing everything I've always wanted to.

But I got made redundant, about two months ago. 

I have enough money saved to keep me going for a few months longer, if I'm careful with it. But it won't last forever.

So my question is; should I continue doing what I'm doing, and pushing myself to fulfill my dream? Or should I get a job? 




 First half was better than the second, imo. Both were excellent. I'm not sure how this compared to the other two. It just seemed a bit more windy, and fell off track more than the others and you really feel it at moments, particularly the second half. 




 Yeah, I'm doing that. The same old song. And that's the one put me in the rut in the first place, it's certainly not helping. 




 But it only comes in the evening... 




 Nice try ;) 




 Too damn right. Wish I could do that. 




 You listen to [one sad song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgmgfDWfOd4), and suddenly you can't shake the irksome feeling of loneliness and inadequacy.

Know what I mean CC? 




 The best time's I had with my friends were on Halo/Halo Wars online. (We used to kick so much ass one Halo Wars, were unstoppable). Me and a friend got super-amazing at SSB on the gamecube, and later the Wii, to the point where we were so matched out fights would last half-an-hour. But other than that, it was all online regardless. 

And Nintendo still do that. Most of their games (Mario Kart, SSB) cater to a couch co-op market. 

I don't think I miss sitting at my friends house drinking cheap beer we had nicked from our parents, I miss that time of my life in general. The gaming has little to do it. 

And I think if I were to say what I missed specifically it would be the nostalgia speaking. There was nothing explicitly amazing about gaming except how I approached it as a young child new to it all. 

I would have liked to have seen games be introduced, and be influenced and been a part of the industry at the time when it was new, and they were just setting the rules. 




 Whenever I'm down I just remind myself that I have exactly the same amount of Oscar's as Leonardo Di'caprio. 


If that doesn't work, I just imagine a T-Rex trying to make a bed. 




 CGP Grey - surprisingly fascinating videos. 




 [Andromeda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udAL48P5NJU)

This is a compilation of images taken with the Hubble telescope, and gives us the most in depth image of Andromeda ever. The image doesn't just do it justice so I've linked a youtube video.

The video selects a portion of Andromeda, somewhat on the fringes and zooms in. And the image just keeps getting noisier and grainier and it keeps happening, and thousands of dots just keep appearing and appearing. And then you reach a moment where the noise falls apart and you realise that all those tiny pixels you mistook for grains...are fucking stars. 

[Also this heartbreaking image, and the story behind it is a really fascinating. Worth looking into, and about the photographer as well.](https://iconicphotos.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/kevin-carter-vulture.jpg?w=700 h=466)

[Also, this guy is a goddamn genius. Linked to his whole website because I couldn't pick a favourite. They're all amazing](http://www.joshuahoffine.com/#/horrordashasdashmetaphor/6) 




 Missed out on?

Gaming is as good as it's ever been. It's at its peak, better than ever. We have different platforms to purchase games. Making games has become so much easier, leading to an incredible rise in the Indie gaming market, which has given us some of the best games ever made, and allowed hundreds to pursue dreams they otherwise might have to have given up on. I can whip out my phone and play a game any time. And I can do it for free. 

The technology is incredible, everything that gaming has to offer is mindblowing. Games are being incorporated into education and healthcare. The console and gaming market is a thriving economy that employs thousands of people globally, and reaches thousands more to give them an outlet of entertainment that can't compare to even a decade ago.

Narrative, and characterisation, alongside fleshed out gameplay have come to a head and that's amazing. 

I honestly wouldn't wish for anything else. 

 




 First of all, before you separate yourself from your novel for a month, here's what I recommend. Read through it now, and just correct any grammatical mistakes, typo's, just all the little things. While the novel is still fresh in your head. You'll be thanking your old self in a months time after spending so long away from it.

The thing is your first draft is meant to be malleable. The editing stage is the point where the book *changes*. You have to sit back and look and decide what serves the story best. It might turn out that involves changing a whole lot, but hey, your story doesn't deserve any less.

It might take a lot of time to do, so it depends how much time you want to put into it. I spent a year editing my novel for nothing to happen with it. You just gotta do it. Don't hesitate because it's a big undertaking, or because your attached to your work. Gut that manuscript till it's bloodless. It's a hard thing to do, but it absolutely must be done. 

Best advice I found when to stop editing? When you find yourself changing things back to what they were originally, stop. You just gotta see what's best for the story. And if you change it only to discover it was better as it was before, now you know. Just change it back, and then leave it for good.



 




 Was about to pop on and recommend this. First comment. I like it =] 




 Only chance I'm going to get to fly. I get lucid dreams so rarely and I never have full control. I can only tip the current dream I'm having in a favourable direction. If I try and take full control it wakes me up. 




 Probably Lilo   Stitch. I love the Lion King, and I love Disney but I have this little point inside of me that remembered hating all the Disney movies for no reason other than because I was a young boy, so there's a little residue from that.

Also, just want to point out the *vast* distinction that has to be made between Pixar and Disney. They are not the same thing. Pixar are incredible, Disney are not. 

Not a shot at the OP, but Inside Out is *not* a Disney movie.

 




 Ask them to fix it. It's what they ought to have done in the first place, explain your position, I'm sure they'll understand. 




 Interestingly enough, I live England, and we do not celebrate at all. 




 When I tell you don't you don't think of an elephant, what's the first thing that pops into your head?

Elephants.


In this instance, Elephant is me googling an animal's penis. 




 Pphh. You don't avoid boredom. You goddamn embrace it and power through it.  




 I like the solitude. It's the one time I'm away from a TV or laptop for any length of time. It's just headphones in and being left alone with nothing but your thoughts for an elongated amount of time. 




 Probably knowing what you're going to do, and what your channel is going to be about helps. That decision should certainly come before contemplating the how of making a video.

Also, production values. Do not underestimate production values. Lights, and a good camera. 




 Been there! 




 Hit me with the most random fact you know off the top of your head. If you have to google it, you're cheating.

Keyboards were actually invented to make the user type as *slow* as possible. That's why they're so random. On typewriters, if the user typed too fast the machine would jam. So keys were placed in non-alphabetical order, and as random as possible to slow us down. Then we just got used to them, and they never changed. 









 What's wrong with Summer Reads? 









 Dragon Age: Inquisition had a decent system like this. Very similar to how AC did it, but a bit better. Unfortunately the rest of the game is meh. 




 I saw the film first, when I was quite young. I still think it's a really good film. That certainly hindered my expectations of the book. A few years later I would read American Gods and within a few weeks I would go through the rest of his bibliography.  




 I thought it was kinda genius. De Niro was actually brilliant in the part.  




 Late reply sorry. I think it is quite good yes. Definitely vastly superior to Twilight. It might take a little while to get into, it's written like that, but after that it's good. 




 It does feel like a compiled book of short stories, especially the way it jumps between characters and their events. But, still, if you're interested in Middle-Earth, it's fascinating. 




 But only what they're allowed to know. That's it. Don't forget they're heavily brainwashed to be very disgusted by the idea of parenthood, and anything natural. 




 Stardust. Because the book doesn't have Robert De Niro as a cross-dressing sky-pirate. :) 




 No. The alpha's wouldn't be the people who look after the livestock, they would have no interaction with anything that bred. 

Furthermore, there brainwashing would have nothing to say about it. They wouldn't know. Perhaps the lower castes would be brainwashed in a certain manner so they could breed, but not the alphas.  




 Iyam! And thanks :) 




 http://bit.ly/1dCgybU

Short link to the vlog for you :)  




 I don't doubt for a second I can get round to all of those :) 

As for 1984, I absolutely loved that book so why not. 




 Not likely. That was a hearken back to the olde days of...2005/6. Not recently. 




 You can follow my brand-new vlog where I'll eventually talk about it. I don't want to plug too obviously so I'll wait to see if you're interested before linking. 




 My sister was a prolific Myspace'r. I guess, in her own humble way, she was myspace famous. Which was *the shit* back in the day. So I guess that's the only reason I got into Myspace. 




 Back in the old days before Facebook. Rush home from school so you could talk to your mates on MSN. And, of course, make sure your *myspace* page was top-notch. 




 I do, but I'm keeping a lid on it for now m'afraid. 




 Yeah I realised my mistake as soon as I made it. Having to make superscript isn't something I often have to do on Reddit. This ( ^ ^ ) is left over my old MSN days. That's how long I've known about it. 









 Did I miss out the other eye? I meant

^ ^

=D 




 I'm exactly the same! I've only just settled down into a nice routine of living my entire life on Reddit. I like this arrangement! 




 :O Thanks ^^  









 Malevolent spirits. And how my two protagonists deal with them at three different stages in their lives. 




 That's enough internet for today. 




 I'm working on my novel. And I also got a new job writing a short-film for a local film-maker, so that's awesome. Especially when I said I'd work for free and he said he'd pay me so...I'm pretty happy with that :) 
























 Thanks, I think I needed this. I've really been contemplating reading them soon, but haven't been able to convince myself. This is a real help. 




 Did not know that... Awesome 




 Which is ok, because they'll know that for a fact.  




 I heard that exact story but about Beethoven... 




 Never seen the film, but the book was a great read. 




 Yes yes yes yes yes. 

Behind The Ocean, American Gods is absolutely the best. It really has to be read. And then read 'Fragile Things' and 'Trigger Warnings', for the short stories. Also because they're both excellent. Also The Graveyard book, and Good Omens (with Terry Pratchett) =D 




 It's pretty obvious to say we spend far too much time on social media. On the internet as a whole. Googling things to find out even the simplest of questions. 

Say what you will about what this has done for society because, assuming there isn't some colossal catastrophe, we have a fixation with documenting every single thing we do. And sure, it's annoying now, but in a hundred years, historians will be able to look back and pinpoint this time as the first time that history was never a huge question mark. They'll be able to look back and see perfectly what we were like, what we did in our spare time, how we felt about everything. We have photographic proof of the food we eat, and the things we liked to watch. We have videos of what we used to do, and looked like and sounded like. For the first time we don't have to guess and assume and put together tiny pieces of a much larger puzzle piece, because it's all there, laid out for future generations.

And that, to me, is pretty damn exciting. 




 (Why) would you takes notes of a book?

(except in the instance of needing to make a reference - for an essay, say). 




 No, you haven't. You gotta learn your facts from somewhere. So long as you didn't look it up just now before you posted :) 




 Hit me with a random fact off the top of your head, if you have to google it, you're cheating.

 Polo indeed - that's a proper royal sport. 




 You really must hate Croquet...

And Boules.  




 How about rather than facing the possibility of closing down you do what every self-published studio must do and *self-promote like a goddamn motherbitch!* 




 I understand how hypotheticals work, but there aren't any stars even remotely near us - that are due to go supernova - that would affect Earth. I'm just being a space nerd, continue with your stories :D 




 The Abhorsen trilogy is like this. The second installment, Lirael, is longest, and Abhorsen, the finale, is the shrotest of the lot.

Also The Night Angel Trilogy gets shorter by each book. 

I also think this is quite a trend with YA where the original idea only fills up the first book, and the rest is just meandering bullshit - clasping at straws to drag the bastard out into a trilogy.

Also the 'The Passage' series. It isn't finished yet but the second book, 'The Twelve' is about half the size of the The Passage, the first one. The last book isn't out yet,  :'(, so we'll have to get a final count for that.

These are just the books I can look to my bookshelf and see.  




 Also, faster streaming. For the same reason. 




 PS4. You're cutting out the middle-man if you don't use a graphics card. The quality gets turned down going into the CC up to your PC and out.  




 It's kind of the reason I don't want to read it now I'm an adult. I'm not sure I'll like it. Having such high expectations, but having so much more to compare it to. I'm worried I'll understand it too well, and not like it. 




 Me too. I haven't read it in super long because I'm scared of it. 




 My favourite drink is Coke. You've probably tried it.

Other than that just normal, English Tea :)

Oh, also, Fanta + Coke is surprisingly nice. And, if you can, adding some Sprite in there is great too. When I worked at McDonalds we could help ourselves to small drinks, so we used to mix them see what tasted nice. Fanta + Coke is surprisingly good. 




 Making his excuses, John rose from his chair. Struggling to make his way through the busy pub, he emerged from the heavy door into the weak midday sun. Collecting himself, he headed towards the Cathedral. 

Better? Worse? 




 This game was fucking BOSS! My childhood right there. Sat with my sister (who was bigger than me, so she got to control the mouse), as we tried to work out the levels. 




 It had to end the way it did. No way around it. 




 No. The books are horrendously awful. But the films are ok. 




 Glad I could help :) 




 How To Train Your Dragon 2 finale I thought was excellently animated. Perfect. And was, hands down, better than both films. 




 I haven't read it in ten years give me a break :( 




 Ah see...sorted. No problems there. 




 You're excused. 




 I'm 23. I read this when I was 13. No matter how many books I've read, some I've liked enough to get tattooed, nothing has even come close to The His Dark Materials. 




 I've tried other stuff. Catch-22, and Toh-Kay and Keasbey Nights. Just nothing compares to Streetlight Manifesto. They're insane. 




 Dude. I thought you were totally on Streetlight Manifesto. Not the other one. When I was talking about the album, I meant this one. This one is amazing! 




 Holy shit, I'm about to go to bed so I was like "yeah, I'll listen to this song quickly."

It's not the Streetlight Manifesto version, and it's not as good. Oh god, its quite terrible actually. Listening to the proper one now, drop the link here methinks. 

[Ah, that's better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfAdFKJfHZ4) 




 Tomb Raider.

Never played Uncharted. Love TR as a kid on PS1. Loved the prequel to Rise of the TR, so... 




 That's the best thing for it to be. 




 Interesting interesting. :)

Genre? 




 It certainly helps. The longer you can stay in the swing the easier it is to stick at a single project for a long time. 




 There have been times when It's been late and I've had to stop writing because I have scared myself. I guess that's stupid, but I scare easily. 

Just, when you write your serial novels where you want to put them for people to read them on the web. You said forum host, not sure what that means.

I just assumed you had a kind of a strategy for putting them on the web. Where to put them, how often, how to make get max views, that sorta thing. 




 My first novel I never pushed myself. It took 3 years, and there's nothing wrong with that. But this new novel I'm pushing myself to write 1k words every day and so far it's really useful.

Whatever works best for you, and there is really no reason to push yourself. But having immediate results gets hella satisfying. 




 They are simply amazing. This album and their new one has so far proven to be the best two though.  




 Ah, that sounds cool. Good luck with the novel. 




 You mean, this is a book and not just a film. My priorities just shifted! 




 Instant internet win for the first ever Streetlight Manifesto reference I have ever come across. A.K.A FUCK YEAH!

I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this song, this album, and THIS BAND! 




 What's your plan for the web serial novels? Got any idea where to post them?

I write any genre really. Especially in shorts. Some horror, some romance. Really all over the place. 




 Best way to get a legit following is for them to see your book on a shelf :) 




 Kudos. You're doing it. Just gotta get better and get that book deal. 




 Hey, writing piecemeal is better than writing nothing. At least you get something done, even it if it's something small.

Like I always say: Progress for it's own sake. 




 Does sound pretty good. 




 There's a story here. 




 Lots of different things. Shorts I write in every genre. Dabble in poetry. My first novel was action/adventure/sci-fi. My new novel is horror/low-fantasy/literary.  




 Yeah I got that. I don't know anyone else who writes. Does suck. 




 15 years is a long time to keep it secret? Why haven't you told anyone? 




 **The Amber Spyglass**

*"Where are we going?"*

*"To build the kingdom of Heaven"*

What I mean is that whole book destroyed me. 




 There is always time. Find time. 7 years is 7 years too long to be away from writing. If there isn't time *make* time! 




 I just want to call out your name because I'm pretty sure it's a reference to *A Day To Remember*, and that's pretty freakin' awesome. 




 Ah, that's not important anyway. Haha. 




 That's a lot of stuff.

I'm working on my second novel at the moment. 




 Well, Emo Culture had to get its inspiration from somewhere. 




 That sounds really interesting. I would read that =] 




 We don't know what the year is. I can load, cock and fire an assault rifle in seconds, but I cannot read a clock. Signs I have read on my campaigns tell me I'm near a place called London. I have never seen the ocean, very few of us have, so I have never left this place. 

First there were the wars. Then we lost people. Then towns and cities were leveled. Then, there were no more countries. I have counted the days I have marched between seeing one green thing, and another. The rest is brown, dead earth and grey, oppressive skies.

Another sign says I'm in London proper. The building's here are the tallest I have ever seen. Though the bones penetrating free from the top of their brick tell me they are no longer as tall as they once were. We will put an end to this war. Not that I, or my parents, or their parents, had any damn clue what we were fighting for. Here we will meet the factions, and we will lay down our arms, and we will dance, and drink. 

The water here is black, and it swallows our weapons and erases them from existence. We spend the night building bonfires, hunting wild animals and drinking the fermented apples and grapes we have brought with us. I meet a girl. And two weeks later we have fallen in love.

There are no more wars. No more enemies. Only allies, and peace. We are left alone, this dark-haired girl and I, to explore this London on our own.

Three weeks later I meet a man whose name I never learned. And when I see him in the arms of my dark-haired girl I attack him and beat him to death. 

War is reignited. There is no war without love. And there is no love without war. 




 Ooh, *out there*, hey? Do tell. =D 




 The room is unnervingly silver. Each wall is a blacked out window and the two subjects feel that through each, eyes are watching them. The room is perfectly square, with a silver table lining one side.

This surface is lined with knives and tools. Each brand new, never used. A circular saw (plugged through the wall and out). A scalpel. A butcher's knife and a meat cleaver. A wire saw. And others.

In the middle there are two surfaces, beds. Again, silver. So shiny and clean that anyone leaning over it would see their reflection staring back at them perfectly. These beds are unremarkable except for the cuffs designed to hold arms and ankles in place, and the bands to stop the person moving entirely.

But the most remarkable thing, as the subject enters the room, is the person standing up and strapped against the only wall that wasn't a window. It was a he, middle-aged and insignificant looking, if not entirely unattractive. He was bound to the wall by his hands and feet and chest, and gagged. He stares at the newcomer mournfully, his eyes a perfect display of pain and sorrow that the new subject couldn't help but feel guilty for. Though without reason.

From no where comes a buzz of static, and a voice. 'Hello, subject 12.This is subject 11. Can I just confirm that neither have you have ever seen each other before in your lives?'

They both shake their heads.

'Good,' the voice continues. 'The purpose of this test is simple. Subject 11 here will die.'

The person across the room visibly shakes and audibly moans, echoing loudly.

'You, subject 12, may stop that. What you cannot stop is him getting hurt entirely. Across the room from you are some utensils. The rules are simple, and the decision is entirely up to you. If you do not harm yourself, at all, subject 11 will die. Slowly, horribly and painfully. If you, subject 12, were to say pick up that knife there and cut off your finger, subject 11 might only lose both his arms. Cut out your eye, and subject 11 might only lose a hand. Understand? Inflict greater pain on yourself, and you will save the stranger a lot of pain himself. The door behind you is unlocked, you can leave anytime you want. Good luck.'

5 grand. And all it might cost you is an arm. The ad didn't say that.

The second subject crosses the room and looks at the instruments laid out in front of them. The man watches their progress. Watches as they gently finger each item. Subject 11 coos as they brush past the circular saw. Cowers when they pick up a bread knife. 

*What to do, to save the life of a stranger?*

*Is my life,* thinks subject 12, *worth that of a strangers?*

They pick up the scalpel and threaten their eye with it, so close they can see the edge. They drop it. They press the trigger on the saw, and it whirs to life with the crisp, robotic sound of ear-splitting whirring. It goes back on the surface. They place their finger over the edge and raise high the meat cleaver. Hesitate. Put their wrist their instead.

*Is it worth it?*

Back goes the meat cleaver.

*Am I worth more than this man?*



 




 I only ask because I did post something on here yesterday, was wondering if you actually came across it. 




 Zombie genre is so wide and open, how can you not like it? It's so multi-faceted...So many angles. 




 Well, it's all about conversation. I'm just surprised there's so many writers here, for a sub aimed at such a general demographic.  




 Which post was that? 









 I've also found myself drawn to that specific genre from time to time.  




 Thankyou ^ ^ 




 Must be nice to have a sub-reddit named after yourself. Kudos to her. Thanks for this! =] 




 I've made threads about writing, and so many people are also writers. And on other threads I'm just checking out, people are writing! And it's awesome there seems to be a sub-culture of writer's on CC but we haven't really ever come together.

Come on CC, let's talk about writing. Tell us about what you write, and your current projects!

Edit: *Buggar, missed out on the question mark in the title. Don't hate on me :(* 




 Who was that? Who got their own subreddit? 




 Was going to have a shot at this prompt but you won so hard I don't want to attempt anything else.

 




 Get up for 8:30. Showered by 9, and at my desk about fifteen minutes later after breakfast. I write at least 1000 words into my novel, sometimes more, sometimes less. Then lunch or more work (depending on how I'm feeling about the novel). Then, after lunch. I choose to write for either my script or my game, whichever is more pressing. Usually both if I can squeeze them in. And I try and do that till 5. Then it's read for a few hours, mooch on Netflix, eat my tea, and play a game on Xbox or read some more or watch a film. 




 [Amy](https://www.wattpad.com/146298625-amy)

This is also a link to my wattpad page. So if you like Amy, check out the rest. I'm really keen on feedback, so please; if you want to rip it apart I welcome you to. Either on this thread or over on Wattpad. I appreciate it :) 




 What is this!? 




 Do you want a hug?

Uh-huh. 




 This sounds like "The Host". 




 Which other subreddit, if I might ask? I'm looking for a place to try and get some stuff out as well. 




 * Catdog
* Ren and Stimpy
* ^^Motherfucking Power Rangers!
 




 What did the mods say? What did you say? 




 Well, the potentials there. 




 It's not naive at all. And if it was, I'd rather comfort someone and be naive, than be cold and an asshole.  




 Feel free to check out my other stuff if you fancy it. It's all on the wattpad profile. Let me know if you do, and what you think. 




 You understand the quote though. 




 *"Everyone is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree it will live it's whole life believing it is stupid."* - Albert Einstein.  




 I think I'm pretty happy with the order as it is. It was a really spontaneous story and I don't want to mess with that spontaneity. When I was in the zone - and writing it - I knew which part had to come next, so I don't want to mess it.

By format do you mean non-chronology? 

Possibly. Hard to say. Like I said the non-chronology was the result of something's not working together, that eventually turned out to work really well when I looked at them from a different angle. It wasn't wholly intentional. Why? 




 Does anyone else have misgivings over this? 




 You mean, that can happen? There's funny stuff that *isn't* on the internet? 









 To be honest that just sort of happened, I didn't really have any choice in the matter. There was so much in the story I wanted to get across, that in order to do that I had to keep on jumping backwards and forwards. Once I realised what was happening, I trimmed the story, kept some things back until the end for narrative purposes and then just wrote whichever bit of the story felt right to write next. 




 The size of it. How much you can do. Admittedly it might not seem like anything to EvE online players, but to me that's pretty exciting. The game holds a sense of discovery, and of isolation, and might be the closest we've got, in a video game, to actually getting out there and discovering these things for ourselves. 














 How was this not the first one on the list? 




 I'm super fucking excited, but will appropriately wait until I know more about the game to commit. 









 It's not heavy romance, to be honest. Very little romance in it. Just takes that angle at times. Sometimes tends to the sexual over the romantic - though that wasn't entirely intentional. 




 I am. Does that make a difference? 




 Thankyou kindly :) 









 **S, or; Straka**, By J.J Abrams and Doug Dorif. 




 Dreams are fascinating because even though we understand that REM sleep is our brains way of cataloging the events of the day. And the reason why our brains wierd out in the night is pretty well known, why all these things come together and allow us to run through (seemingly) absolutely random stories and events, with somewhat clear images and emotions, we have no idea. But our bodies are so used to this that the brain paralyzes itself during sleep so we don't enact these dreams. That's pretty...fascinating. 




 I've just started a booktube channel. Uploaded the second episode today. 




 Well, I know what I have to do now haha. 




 10 hour music videos. Awesome. Didn't expect there to be a big audience there, but hey, what do I know? 




 Well done!

What are your video's about? I'm trying to start up my own channel at the moment. 









 I know I'm pretty much repeating what a lot of other people have said, but absolutely fair play to the guy. It's not like people are just giving him the money, he absolutely earns it. And it doesn't matter how many people dislike him, he gets his views and he's the most subscribed to channel for a reason.

And, more's the matter, he seems like a pretty nice bloke. Whenever he does videos like this, he seems calm and kind. He has done charity work and that certainly shouldn't be forgotten. And it shouldn't matter if you like him or hate him, you have to appreciate the charity work that's done.
