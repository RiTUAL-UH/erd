 Typical liberal comment: criticize the messenger but never get around to dispute the article with facts.

FAIL

 




 Let's stop the misdirection and answer with a straight up yes or no:

Do you support laws and procedures that allow any eligible voter to vote while ALSO preventing ineligible voters from voting?

 




 Do you have any proof that these pics are of Tea Party rallies? I have a pic below that was taken at an occupy rally. Racist?

http://i.imgur.com/Rq8tHLZ.jpg 




 Unfortunately, until our election process changes, you can't have both.

Why is that?

Unless you accept and support allowing only eligible voters to vote then you do not care about fair elections and only seek an advantage for the Left. At least be honest that you are only for laws that help get Democrats elected.  




 The Tea Party is not racist whatsoever.  




 You are evading and have proven my point that the Left is not interested in fair elections.  




 All I want is only eligible people voting. No one is turned away who is eligible and no one is allowed who is not eligible. We must have both elements. 




 Let's see if you are serious about fair elections. Do you support a law that both ensures EVERY eligible voter can vote and that prevents EVERY ineligible voter from voting? 




 Allowing votes from the disqualified, multiple votes from the same person, and fraudulent voting are just as bad a problem. 

We need to ensure that ALL qualified people can vote and ALL fraudulent voting is stopped.

Do you agree?

 Sorry but you are confused. Anti Tea party and anti Fox News? Yup, you are a Democrat 




 The Tea Party supports three policies: 1. lower taxes, 2. smaller government, 3. less government regulation.

How are any of these policies extreme or far right? 




 You called the Tea Party extremist. You are either a Leftist or you are politically naive.  




 Interesting how the Left can never even have a simply political discussion without getting angry. It seems as if the Left is more of a religious movement than a political one. Any dissent will not be tolerated and will be met with anger.   




  the Tea Party, but they're extremist,

You are losing credibility fast my friend.  




 It is only anti Left. It is not a hate site. I bet you think the Tea Party is a hate group also... 




 What is progressivism progressing to? What is their endgame? Progressivism is certainly  not some general desire to improve the country and society. Progressivism  is the endless march towards strict Leftist ideology. Ultimately progressivism will end gun ownership by private citizens.

 It is no more a cesspool than what is seen on Reddit comments. I find it truly fascinating at the worldview and grasp of reality of the Left and the Right. It is as if both sides are living in parallel universes and experiencing different realities. What that means is that one entire half of the US is either dumb, delusional, or in a cult like trance. 

It is scary that aside from politics, the very fabric of reality is disputed by the two sides.    




 Moonbattery.com is anti LIBERAL/PROGRESSIVE. It is not in any way racist, anti gay, anti education, hateful, disgusting, anti poor etc. Simply being against the Left does not equate to being racist and hateful.

 The box she checked stated that mere subjective belief that one was native American was not enough. One needed to be recognized by a tribe or have been on a tribal registry. She knew that she could not provide either yet she decided to check the box anyway. She did that on more than one occasion.

Am I wrong?

Well?

Crickets.... 




 Nice job (I mean it) but you are confusing the terms Conservative (capital C) and conservative (lower case C). The two are not the same.

This is also true with Liberals as opposed to liberals

The Tea Party are Conservatives who are interested in being conservative regarding giving power to the government. That does not mean they are conservative in all things social or science.

A Liberal is a Leftist. That is different from a small L liberal who is a person who favors government ensuring the rights of all. JFK was a liberal. Obama is a Liberal

 

 




 I'm a left-leaning moderate who favors socialistic systems over capitalistic.

Haven't we had enough socialist solutions? Didn't we learn anything from the Soviets? the Maoists? the Khmer Rouge? The Nazis? The Fascists? The Cubans? Those socialist solutions have resulted in the deaths of over 100 million people during the past century. 

You really idolize those murderous regimes?  




 No one has said that modern conservative parties make a platform on racism

Please explain why there is no dissent within the Left? What policies of the Democrats do you oppose? 




 You have failed to refute my points. Nice interpretation of American Values. Lol

Why would the Republicans embrace ANY policy that would:

1. Attract a tiny minority of voters (Voters for whom racism is at the very top of their requirements in a candidate)

2. Anger and offend the vast majority of the voting public?

It makes no logical sense to do so. Can you imagine a party adopting a policy of "We are the party of pedophiles"?

The Left has lied about Republicans and their alleged embrace of racism.

Without lies the Left has nothing 




 I have debated you and you seem more interested in being snarky than debate. Typical liberal avoidance  




 Maybe you should read the thread first? If you don't understand then ask an adult  




 Good article. Everyone should read it just to familiarize themselves with the claims on both sides (minus the snarkiness). Then they should think critically and decide on their own what to believe.  




 Political parties do evolve over time. 

What my point is is that Liberals like to view American politics as The Republican Party was "good" when Lincoln was president and the Democrats were less so. At some magical moment, the two parties switched and the Democrats became "good" and the Republicans decided to become evil and embrace racism.

Unfortunately the facts don't prove that wishful thinking.

Both parties have evolved over time. Both parties have embraced bigger government to various extents. Both have evolved in how they view the role of government.

There has never been a magical shift of the parties in terms of "good" and "bad" nor has there been a shift in the parties' overtly racist policies.

The Democrat Party refuted racism in the 60's and 70's. The Republicans never embraced racism as a policy. 

Got it? Any more smug snarky retorts? 




 Atwater said that the GOP offered the Southern Democrats a choice based on the GOP's position on traditional values. He expressly stated that the GOP did NOT have to attract the disaffected Democrats with appeals to racism.

There was no ideological shift.
  
That is not a "shift" in terms of the GOP embracing racism as the Democrats had done for 150 years prior.

The GOP never embraced racism. The Democrats simply stopped supporting overt racism in the 60's and 70's

 




 Wrong. I have read all of the links provided and commented on them. Several have been good in explaining various flows of each parties' evolving policies and positions.

What those links have failed to do is show a shift of racist policies from the Democrats to the GOP. The Democrats have historically been a party that embraced overt racism for over 150 years. It was only in the 60's and the 70's when the Democrats refuted overt racism. 

Simply because the Democrats refuted overt racism in the 60's and 70's does not mean that the GOP embraced racism as a political strategy.

 




 Provide facts. Your opinion and insults offer nothing 




 Thank you for the links. The Live Science was interesting as it explains a bit about how at the turn of the 20th century and into the FDR administration, both parties embraced bigger government. Certainly the rise of revolutionary Communism after WWI further motivated governments fearful of revolution, to expand government programs. 

The article does not explain a switching of racist attitudes (or the switching of party platforms) from the Democrats to the GOP as has been claimed in the comments of the post. 

Thank you also for the Hufpo article. It was informative and a good read.  That article showed how both parties evolved politically to match society's evolution regarding social issues during the turn of the 20th century. The article did a good job until it made a jump to the 60's and tried to connect the two periods as being a profound shift in which the Democrat Party refuted racism and the GOP embraced it. In that aspect the article failed. 

Interestingly, this article supports the recent evolution of the GOP that once supported bigger government being influenced by the Tea Party to reduce the size of government. Political parties eventually evolve with the will of the voters.  




 You claimed there was a shift and you failed to provide proof. Unless you provide proof, your opinions are just that 




  Its pretty common knowledge.

Your link only discusses Barry Goldwater's struggle within his own party. 

If your claim is true then there should be ample documentation of this so called switch. Please provide more than simply claim it's common knowledge














 




 Stop evading and provide evidence, proof, facts.... 




 You can't refute my facts and you are calling me stupid? 

I challenge YOU to refute my facts...

Well?

Crickets.........
 




 Did you even read that wikipedia section? It states that there was a migration of Democrat voters to the GOP over several decades. 

It does not say that there was a "shift" of  racist attitudes from the Democrats to the GOP. 

It does not say that the GOP embraced racism in order to attract racist Southern voters.  




 Uneducated Liberals claim such a shift but no such shift ever happened. The Left uses that claim to try and disguise their disgusting history of oppressive racism.

If someone wishes to dispute this fact then please provide facts, dates, people involved etc who orchestrated this so called "switch" 




 The Southern Strategy is often misunderstood. It is based on an interview decades ago by Republican Lee Atwater. 

In the interview, Atwater stated that the GOP could use economic issues to attract southern Democrat "Dixiecrat" voters who felt they were being abandoned by the Democrat Party's shift to the Left away from traditional American values. 

The interview featured him stating that the GOP could use economic issues not just racist appeals of "nigger nigger". This quote is often edited and claimed to prove that the GOP had a formal strategy of adopting overt racism in order to capture the votes of racist southerners.

If one listens to the interview, they will see that the claim of an embrace of racism by the GOP is not what Attwater is saying.

Demographic studies have shown that there was not a sudden shift of Dixiecrat voter away from the Democrat Party to the GOP after the Civil Rights acts of the 60's. The migration of Democrats to the GOP in the south has been a gradual movement over 30 years. This migration was due to a belief that the Democrat Party was abandoning them by moving to the Left politically and rejecting American values. It was not due to racism.

http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2013/04/the-southern-strategy-debunked-again.php

The logical question remains: why would a major political party  adopt a policy of racism given that voters for which racism is an important political issue is minute and the the number of voters who would be offended by such a policy is huge? 

In other words it is illogical for a political party intent on winning nation elections to embrace any position in which the benefits are tiny and the negatives are huge. 




 This is a common misconception. Can you provide any evidence of this switch?

 When she applied for the teaching positions in Texas and at Harvard she was asked about Native American heritage. The question of Native American heritage often comes up in employment. 

Because too many whites claim Indian heritage when they are really not Native American, the questionnaires she filled out qualified how that question could be answered.

The questionnaires stated that a subjective belief was not enough to claim Native American heritage. What was needed was acceptance or affiliation with a recognized Indian tribe.

She was not identified by any tribe as a member nor did she maintain any tribal affiliation yet she answered the employment question in the affirmative anyway. She lied

She also lied about her answer and tried to pull a cover up regarding the whole issue.

She lied and plagiarized several recipes in a book called "Powwow Chow" 

Her husband, also not an Indian, penned a recipe for that book and he also falsely claimed to be of Indian heritage.

 So you see, lying has been a regular aspect of her personality and of her lack of respect for rules

 




 What a nice collection of Leftist fables you have collected. 

A few notes: 

The Koch bros are not the running the GOP and have NO influence over the Tea Party. They are free to support any policies they wish but that has no bearing on how the Right votes.

What is an "anti atheist law". I am a Conservative and an atheist and I have never herd that term before.

There is no political will in this country to ban or seriously curtail abortions. That is a dead issue that the Left brings up to demonize the GOP.

 But she did lie about her Indian heritage in order to take an affirmative action position away from a real minority.

That has absolutely NOT been debunked. It is a fact 




 Socialism has failed everywhere it has been tried. Socialism has been responsible for the deaths of over 100 million people over the past century. 

It has never worked because inherent in socialism is the coercive and violent threat of government against anyone who resists their control. 

Socialism is an ideology. It is not an ala carte menu. It is a mindset, a philosophy that the "haves" are evil and must be sacrificed to the "have nots". Socialism is about exerting control over the population by a cadre of self proclaimed elites. 

I do not want any group of so called elites making decisions for me and bossing me around.

 Socialism is the step before communism. Socialism can operate parasitically in a Capitalistic system (to a certain extent) whereas Communism sweeps the old Capitalistic system aside. 




 That graph correlates with the rise in Leftist policies adopted by the US government. Thanks for making my point. 




 Communism is what comes after socialism has been established (in a capitalist state). Fascism is just another form of socialism featuring extreme nationalism and has nothing to do with Conservatism whatsoever.

This is basic poli sci 101 stuff.   




 The Scandinavian countries employ many socialistic policies but they are not true socialistic states.

Costs are much higher unless one is very poor and heavily subsidized.

Regarding affirmative action, I will often ask Liberals at what point should AA end? Invariably they always say "never".

The goal is not equality but rather keeping minorities controlled and dependent so that they vote as a block for Democrats.    




 Can you make a serious comment? What proof do you have that racism is a motivating factor to Conservatives? 




 As a Conservative, I am against ANY Liberal progressive socialist politician regardless of their race, creed, color, ethnicity, sex, age, sexual preference or any other qualifier. 

The claim  that Conservatives are racist is a strategic tool the Left uses to AVOID debating issues and solutions in a meaningful and productive way. By claiming racism, the debate ends, the issues remain undebated, and the Conservative is vilified as a bad person. 




 How can you even make that claim? Based on what? Dude, where did you pick up your crazy ideas? 




 The cognitive dissonance on the Left is truly fascinating.  Sort of like children plugging their ears with their fingers so they don't hear that which they dislike.  




 Moxy, I simply don't know why you are fighting this so hard. It is a proven fact that Hitler and Mussolini were devout socialists as were their respective Nazi and Fascist movements. 

We can trade comments til the cows come home but that won't change documented, undisputed, factual history. You simply can't deny it just because you wish it weren't so.  

Curious question:What level of education have you achieved? I am assuming a few college classes 




 You are obviously confused and lumping Marxism, socialism, Naziism etc into a polyglot of isms. Marxism IS a form of socialism as is Naziism but although they share many key points they also differ in important ways.

You really should study the history of socialism in Germany during the turn of the 20th century. It is a fascinating period in which many socialist philosophers explored various types of socialism in search of the best and most equitable form.

With that said, you make the mistake of confusing the meaning of "control over the means of production". That term incorporates actual ownership such as a nationalized industries, coercive control over industries, and it includes crony capitalism in which certain favored corporations are given exclusivity and non favored corporations are excluded.

Hitler was a devout socialist and not an opportunist that simply attached himself to the term. He wrote extensively on the virtues of socialism and  even founded what became the German Socialist Workers Party.

Please expand your scholarly investigations beyond wikipedia. The study of socialism is a fascinating and diverse exploration into human attempts at optimum organizational systems

 Nice post. Amazing how fast the roaches scurry for the shadows when a light is flicked on.  




 It's CNN. Go figure 




 

    The Nazis were against Capitalism.

No they were not - that is just an outright untruth.

Really? Let's look at the primary sources, the Program of the National Socialist German Workers Party (Nazi) itself: http://www.stephenhicks.org/2009/10/26/appendix-1-nsdap-party-program-nietzsche-and-the-nazis/

A few keys points of that program:

"Point 11 calls for the abolition of all income gained by loaning money at interest.

Point 12 demands the confiscation of all profits earned by German businesses during World War I.

Point 13 demands the nationalization of all corporations.

Point 14 demands profit-sharing in large industrial enterprises.

Point 15 demands the generous development of state-run old-age insurance.

Point 16 calls for the immediate socialization of the huge department stores. "



 And here is a quote from Adolf Hitler in a speech in 1927: We are socialists, we are enemies of todays capitalistic economic system for the exploitation of the economically weak, with its unfair salaries, with its unseemly evaluation of a human being according to wealth and property instead of responsibility and performance, and we are all determined to destroy this system under all conditions.

Here is a quote from Josef Goebbels: The worker in a capitalist stateand that is his deepest misfortuneis no longer a living human being, a creator, a maker. He has become a machine. A number, a cog in the machine without sense or understanding. He is alienated from what he produces.[

http://www.stephenhicks.org/2009/12/04/economic-socialism-not-capitalism-section-8-of-nietzsche-and-the-nazis/

These quotes were just what I googled in 10 seconds worth of research. 

Your claim that the Nazis were Capitalists or supported Capitalism is thus proven False. 




 I was being sarcastic. In my experience, people are much more forgiving of slights and insults when they are carrying. I assume it's because such challenges to one's manhood are not really challenges at all. Carrying gives them the power of life and death and it allows them to be a merciful god.  




 The Nazis were against Capitalism. They "controlled" not owned the means of production.

The Nazis were against the Communists because they viewed them as competitors. Hitler also felt that international Communism contained too many Jews as members. Communism was internationally focused while Naziism was more nationalistic. 

Denmark has some socialist policies but it is a different form of socialism than Naziism. Also the Nazis and the Fascists (both socialists) were distinct in that Fascism did not involve the extreme racism and  antisemitism of Naziism.

Naziism and Fascism are often incorrectly lumped together as the same system. They were not. The confusion results from the Soviets lumping the two systems together in propaganda during WWII.  




 Wikipedia it. Socialism includes several economic/political systems such as Communism, Naziism, Fascism, and even Anarcho Syndicalism etc.

Al have various distinctions but all include non private control over the means of production and a government centric society  




 The Nazis were socialists. The Tea Party is the opposite of socialism. School much? 




 12 but I still out debated you with ease.  




 I live the Tea Party while you merely hear snarky soundbites about it.

I think I will stay in the reality based  community rather than your community based reality. 




 The Tea Party is a grassroots organization with no central leadership or structure based on the ideas of 1.smaller government, 2. less taxes, and 3. less government regulation.  

The Left has created a weird false fantasy that we are just dupes of the Koch bros.  

That fantasy is 100% false. The Kochs support Conservative political views and that is fine by me. But they do not control the Tea Party in any way.

The recent midterm election tsunami proves that the political sands are shifting in a monumental way and the Kochs could not be the cause of it. 

 




 What a silly and untrue statement. I am a hardcore Tea Party Conservative and the Kochs have ZERO influence on my political views whatsoever. 

I am not just saying that to be argumentative or contrary. I am being totally honest here. The Kochs exert ZERO influence over the Tea Party and the Conservative wing of the GOP. 

I am very active in online and real life Conservative forums and I have NEVER heard of anyone even discussing the Koch bros.  




 Ooops! Didn't mean to touch a nerve.  At this point I should realize that to some, reddit is their only social outlet and that I have no business making light of that fact. No harm, no foul. Good luck

 My only point was that she only had 90 rounds of ammo for a mission that logic would dictate would require more (multiple hard targets). 

Now please tell everyone about how you are a Navy SEAL BUDS instructor and enthrall us with your tales of glory and daring do...  




 Let me get this straight, you are acting like you have sand in your vagina over a pic of a Navy sailor holding a handful of gummi bears? Dude, go outside, ride a bike, volunteer somewhere, interact with some live humans.... 




 So fast you'll be early for class yesterday 




 The most likely threats to a docked ship are below the surface, on the surface, and in the air. Not much she can do regarding underwater or aircraft threats. She is likely to have to deal with small boat attacks probably in numbers larger than one. It is highly unlikely that she will be able to deal with such a threat with 60 rounds of 5.56mm and 30 rounds of 9mm.

 




 What about hunting or target shooting? 




 That doesn't seem to be adequate. I imagine any asymmetric attack would involve multiple targets and require more than +/- 90 rounds to deal with. Sounds like politically correct bs at play... 




 Just concerned that if you had to deal with an asymmetric threat that you would have more than one or two mags.   




 Christie and Bush have zero support from the Tea Party. They both have zero chance of being nominated. Walker would be just what this country needs after 8 years of the Obama debacle

 The oil and gas released from fracking is collected via a controlled tube. There are many shale and impermeable rock layers between the oil and gas and the surface and ground water. The fracking process only fracks a few layers leaving most layers intact. 

I understand your frustration and need to be snarky but is there a part of you who can simply discuss the factual realities of fracking?

Turn off the religious part of your brain and just weight the facts. 

A question for you:

If fracking methods and fossil fuel usage were technologically advanced to the point that we could guarantee that no environmental damage ever occurred, would you  accept fracking and the use of fossil fuels?  




 It's lubricants that allow the sand to pass within the cracks that the fracking pressure creates. Even if it's plutonium, at that depth (over 1-2 miles from the surface) the chemical is going to stay there. 

You obviously are arguing with feelings and not with science. The oil industry has been injecting all types of lubricants, oil, chemicals etc into deep disposal wells for a hundred years with no issues. Why is it so hard for you to grasp the science involved? 




  Speculation. We don't know what chemicals they use and in what amounts because they have fought and won to keep them secret.

No, we do know exactly what happens to those chemicals because deep well waste injections have been done for a hundred years. The chemicals and the water react with iron ore in the soil and transform into iron oxide, rust essentially. This is chemistry 101 stuff.

You are trying to bring your environmentalism, your religion, your philosophical aversion to fossil fuels into a scientific factual discussion. 

Unless you have divested your lifestyle from the benefits of fossil fuels then you are just not being a credible advocate. 

Note: I fully embrace the day when we can utilize totally clean energy. That is definitely our goal and or destiny. We simply need to allow the science to develop. Shooting ourselves in the foot by stopping  the use of fossil fuels prematurely is  philosophically satisfying but realistically naive and harmful.

 I am sorry that your Liberal narrative is being refuted by reality. No one is stopping you from providing facts that you feel counter the facts provided in this post. 

Apparently, the Left views ANY challenge to their ideology as being evil or bizarre.  




 advocating for 'traditional marriage'

Her motivation for advocating traditional marriage is her own moral beliefs. That does not equate to her hating anyone. You are doing what the Left frequently does which is to assume anyone who has a different viewpoint must have an evil intention behind it. If someone stands for traditional marriage then they must be anti gay. Anyone opposed to Obama's policies must be a racist. 

I actually listen to Glenn Beck and he has never stated any anti LGBT attitudes at all. 

Apparently the old saying is true "Conservatives think Liberals are wrong. Liberals think Conservatives are evil" 




 These articles are not anti LGBT. One says people should not be forced to do business that conflicts with their beliefs. Religious people should not be forced to bake LGBT cakes just as LGBT bakers should not be forced to bake Westboro Baptist cakes. The government shouldn't force anyone to bake any cake that conflicts with their personal or business philosophies. 

The other article is about a woman who questioned the methods of GLAAD but was not anti LGBT.

Can you explain to me how these articles show the Blaze is anti LGBT?
 




 The Blaze is not anti gay. What a sad, twisted world view you must have.  




 What a miserable life you must lead. Don't you have anything better to do with your time than being an internet agitator?  




 You seem to enjoy trolling others who don't think exactly as you do. Are you intentionally trolling or are you really that unhappy?  




 Liberals get confused when their ideology clashes with reality.  




 You Leftists are never wrong. No matter what proof I offer you will reject it as inadequate. I could literally provide video proof and you would reject it as not enough. 

I reject religion as a guiding force. I reject YOUR religion. Why can't you simply allow others to make up their own minds? 

 




 You Leftists are never wrong. The democrat party is like a faith based religion rather than a political organization. 




 That the Democrat Party is no longer a party of ideas and classical liberal thought but rather the followers of rigid, leftist ideology.    JFK could not get elected as a democrat today. The party demands politicians in the manner of Barack Hussein Obama and Elizabeth "fauxcahontas" Warren

 So you maintain that the Democrats are not anti gun and that they have no intentions of increasing gun control?

Is that your contention? 




 This is why no one believes you're a gun owner.

 You are right. 

The Democratic Party fully supports gun rights. They have no intentions of restricting gun rights.

 Not at all. The Democrat Party AKA Liberals have openly stated that they are anti gun.  It amuses me that you refute that.

 No one is stopping you from offering proof. 




 http://yubanet.com/uploads/4/Planeten-Jorden.jpg 




 I don't know who David Klein is but your link authored by him is simply his uneducated opinion. Nothing more.


I assume he is referring to Goldberg's book "Liberal Fascism". The term Liberal Fascism was derived from a speech made by George Orwell in the 1930's. Goldberg's book of the same name is fully footnoted and extremely well researched. 

In that book, Goldberg describes the various versions of socialism that was being created and discussed around the early part of the 20th century. Naziism and Fascism were two  forms of socialism.

Hitler and Mussolini were both serious writers of socialist political philosophy and championed its use as a fairer system than capitalism. Each created a unique brand of socialism that they felt was better and fairer than the previous versions of socialism offered by others up til them.

Both systems retained the classical elements of standard socialism including non private ownership of thee means of production (and distribution), a planned economy, and a government/community centric society at the expense of individual freedom. Both also offered unique elements that only their form of socialism featured. 

I am sorry that you don't agree with historical fact. Some think that fire can't bend steel and that 9/11 was an inside job. If you wish to contest proven historical fact then please offer your own proof. Goldberg's book is full of footnotes. Can you refute any of them? 

To repeat an overused cliche, the truth hurts. The Nazis and the Fascists were true socialists. 

Never be afraid of the truth. Good luck 




 Actually, the Nazis and the fascists were both socialist movements. Hitler and Mussolini were prolific writers on socialism. This is historic fact. Some are confused by the fact that the Nazis were bitter enemies of the soviet Union and mistakenly assume that makes the Nazis and Fascists polar opposites to to Soviets 




 Actually, the Nazis were socialists so historically that is accurate. My previous comment merely stated how I felt sorry for you for you supporting a political philosophy that was determined to limit your civil rights. It shows how politically confused you are.  




 The rest of the educated world disagrees with you.  




 The naivete of Liberals never surprises me. The Left has always wanted to eliminate guns in private hands. You are like one of those Jews in the concentration camps who collaborated with the Nazis. Your position arises pathos in me for you rather than blowing my mind.  




 The Left can only thrive if it lies about itself and its opponents.  




  Most Americans don't want to wind the clock back before the 1940's.

No one has mentioned the 40's. All Conservatives want is smaller government, less taxes, less regulation. It is our contention that government is out of control. It expands every year in its scope, size, and influence in the people's lives. Power is a zero sum game. Power is finite. The bigger slice of the power pie that the government takes must come at the expense of the people's freedom and liberty. 

How can you possibly view these goals as extreme? I simply don't want politicians deciding for me how to live my life and control my destiny. 




 Where the Democrats want to take this country is diametrically opposed to where Conservatives want to take this country. Grid lock is not a bad think. Compromise is a death by a thousand paper cuts.

One simply has to look at where each party ultimately wants to take the country.

The Left, the Democrats want to march us towards a communal socialist state rule by a rigid, uncompromising ideology.

The right, the Conservatives want the US to have smaller government and less government interference in the people's lives. They want to follow the path of Jeffersonian Democracy. 




 Though from space it looks like a impact crater or the remnants of an ancient volcano, the Kondyor Massif, in Russia, is neither. Rather it is in what's known in geological terms as an "intrusion." An intrusion forms when molten magma of igneous rock crystallizes below the surface of the earth, in this case forming a perfectly circular rocky ring over a billion years ago. (Because they form underground, intrusions are also known as plutons, named for Pluto, the Roman god of the underworld.) Harder then the rest of the earth around it, the Kondyor Massif intrusion (in this case an alkaline-ultrabasic massif intrusion) has slowly made its way through 5000 miles of mantle and is now visible on the surface of the earth. A stream flows out from its center, fueled by the snow waters melting from the Kondyor Massif's 2000-foot-high rim. 




 Apparently for most redditors no 




 Wow dude. That's a big butt plug. 




 Marx wrote of a transition from capitalism via socialism into communism. The end game is ultimately community ownership of everything. Socialist theory has always stated such. Progress to the Left does not mean a general improvement of society or a fairer system. Progress means a march towards a specific, rigid, Leftist, ideology. 

Some assume Sweden or Norway like states are the goal of socialist societies. It is not. Those states are merely transitory, stepping stones along a path that ultimately leads to true and rigid socialism. 

  




 I disagree. Within the GOP we debate regarding issues such as legalization of pot, gay marriage, abortion, religion in government, immigration, taxation, size of government,  with several factions (Tea Party, establishment GOP, religious right, Libertarians, RINOs) all fighting for influence. 




 You are naive if you think the Democrats desire anything less than a total ban on most firearms. They would pass such a ban today if they thought they could get away with it.   




 Wrong. The Tea Party wants RINOs and fake establishment republicans gone. The TP desire less taxes, less regulation, and smaller government. That's it. Nothing radical at all. 

When dealing with the hard Left Democrat party, moderation is irrelevant. The Democrats want to fundamentally change the USA. We oppose that agenda. There can be no compromise.  




 The bullet got inserted into the case upside down. It will still fire just fine. Troops during WWI used to intentionally flip bullets and insert them upside down so when fired they would impact on steel plates and cause spauling on the other side of the plate. It was a means of killing soldiers hiding behind steel.   




 I listed true socialist states and not quasi socialist states that feature rich, homogenous populations, that feature some socialistic policies but are clearly not actual socialist states. Also those states can afford more socialist policies because the USA pays for their defense. Lets see socialism work in a poor country without coercion and violence. 




  Did you somehow miss the part where the Democratic party's philosophy is fundamentally at odds with socialism? I guess you did because I've already explained it.

All you said was the Dems are for tax cuts which they clearly oppose

If you think this, then you have literally never picked up a history textbook. Socialism has always been characterized, and in fact, requires, sudden and violent change.

You may want to reread your Marx comrade. I think you missed a few chapters. The process from capitalism to communism is a long march not a sudden violent explosion:

https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/staterev/ch05.htm

 




 What about economic issues? Taxes? 

Clearly neither socialism not the Democrat Party favors anti ethnic or anti sexual identity policies regardless of past transgressions. 

Today's Democrat Party is in lock step with all of the elements of classical socialism. 

Socialism is a long march towards a definite destination. At first there is a period where socialism exists along side capitalism. It exploits Capitalism and co-opts it. Rather than outright government/community ownership of the means of production, socialism at first controls industries via crony Capitalism and regulatory favoritism. Eventually, socialism evolves from a parasitic relationship with its Capitalist host and kills it and instilling all classical aspects of socialism (ultimately to communism) 




  Democrats are trying to fight for an increase in size of the traditional middle class. This is not something that socialism supports - socialism supports classless society.

What policies specifically?

Tax cuts for the middle class. Socialism would not support tax cuts, period.

Absolute and total lie. Name Any tax cut proposed by the Democrats

Tax-cuts for small businesses. Socialism supports large state-owned companies, not small businesses.

Absolute and total lie. Name Any tax cut proposed by the Democrats

Pro-immigration reform. Socialism does not jive with multicultural societies.

Immigration reform is designed only to create dependent Democrat voting block. As for multiculturalism, no such limitations are a part of any socialist ideology except for Naziism. Isn't Cuba multicultural?

LGBT rights. Again, socialist countries across the world have pretty much never encouraged this, to the point at which you could be punished.

Socialism dictates no such restrictions on sexual identity except for the Nazis

Freedom of speech. Also isn't supported by socialism

There is no debate within the Democrat Party. Ever been to a college campus? Dissenting opinions/viewpoints are forbidden and routinely shouted down or silenced as hate speech, micro aggressions etc

 




 No, the Tea Party wants the RINOs out. 




 Such as? 




 You are confusing traditional liberalism as practiced via Jeffersonian democracy. Over the latter part of the 20th century, liberalism was co-opted by the Left. It no longer means open to new ideas and personal freedom. Today it mean a rigid and static path towards classical, ideological socialism. Ever notice why there is NO debate regarding policy within the Democrat party? It is ideologically rigid with no acceptance of any competing messages or policies. 




 Modern day Liberalism is merely one path to the ultimate end game of true, in practice socialism. Liberalism is a form of socialism whereby American culture and traditions are destroyed and replaced by socialist policies. 

In essence, Liberalism is a transitory phase of socialism but it is indeed socialism. 

 




 I know what the word means. Socialism is an economic and political philosophy characterized by non private ownership of the means of production, a planned economy, and a government or community centric society at the expense of personal freedom.

Key socialistic governments have existed in the Soviet Union, Maoist China, Castro's Cuba, Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge, the Nazis, and Mussolini's Fascist Italy to name a few.

  




 Someone of YOUR income would not be invited to eat there. It does matter.  




 Liberal used to mean open to new ideas and free thinking. The term has been co-opted by the hard Left and now means something very different: Hardcore socialist. 




 So you are saying that income inequality does not matter and should not be a political issue?

 I beat you fair and square in a debate on fracking. I provided too many facts and you wilted under the pressure and quit.

Today, truth won out over religion. 




 Please provide proof that fracking causes ground water pollution. Fracking has been used for nearly 100 years. It has a great safety record. The only danger is rare cases of tiny leaks caused by equipment failure. These rare cases release the same amount of oil as a vehicle crash and a fuel tank rupture. 

Seriously, if you reject the scientific facts of fracking then you oppose it for religious reasons. If so, I believe you have the right to belong to any faith based belief system you choose but don't try to force everyone else to join also. I am an atheist and I don't want to join anyone's religion. Even if it is Gaia based environmentalism.

 Well failures are rare. They typically involve defects in the well shaft casing. Any leakage of anything is quickly discovered via a drop in pressure in the well. Ground water and the fracking chemicals and gas and oil produced are separated by thousands of feet of earth and many layers of impermeable shale.

Thus, the only way for anything to contaminate water is via a defect in the pumping equipment or defect in the well casing. Such defects can be quickly fixed. 

  




 Be the mature one, visit her and make peace. She can't harm you while she is alive anymore but you may regret it someday if you don't.

 Actually, when I took graduate level chemistry classes I learned that fracking chemicals are injected thousands of feet away from ground water separated  by many layers of impermeable shale . I also learned that the fracking chemicals react with iron compounds in the earth and convert the chemicals into iron oxide AKA rust.  




 Hitler was a capitalist? Not even close. Hitler was an avowed and committed socialist.  

http://www.stephenhicks.org/2009/12/04/economic-socialism-not-capitalism-section-8-of-nietzsche-and-the-nazis/

 'non privately held means of production', that's redundant.

I was pointing out that at various stages of socialist theory, the means of production are owned or controlled by the state and then ultimately by the community (and likely administered by the state for the community). I was not being redundant. 
 




 I agree the various socialistic systems seek to achieve the same end game via differing paths but they all end up at the same destination ultimately. That is a planned economy,  non privately held means of production and distribution (whether held by "the community" or by government), and a government (or community) centric society at the expense of personal freedom.

 As for fascism, that and Naziism were true socialist ideologies. You listed some of the unique elements of their brand of socialism but you fail to acknowledge their commonality with "classical" socialism. Fascism and Naziism featured no private ownership of the means of production (and distribution), a planned economy,  and a government (or community) centric society at the expense of personal freedom. 

Socialism is a family tree that shares the same roots 




 Anti fracking is anti science. Liberals are hypocrites.  




  reform socialism like seen in most of Europe and Canada

I disagree. There is no such thing as reform socialism. Socialism has many forms (communism, progressivism, Naziism, fascism, anarcho syndicalism, etc). Each form has distinct differences that can be considered distinct paths towards an end goal. The end goal for all systems is ultimately the same.  




 Please reread the article. It claims that water levels have risen an average of 3mm per year during winter storms only. The sea levels have not risen and remained higher.

 If you say so... 




  He used the socialist title to as gimmick to attract followers.

Proof?

The fact is that during the late 19th and early 20th centuries many political philosophers were trying to formulate the most equitable form of socialism. Among these were Communism, Fascism, Naziism, even Anarcho Syndicalism (of Monte Python Holy Grail fame) and several others. All of these forms of socialism maintain the standard elements of classical socialism such as non private ownership of the means of production, a planned economy, and a government centric society at the expense of individual liberty. All of these forms of socialism also featured important differences such as Communism's international focus or Naziism's extreme racism. 

The study of socialism is an interesting exploration of political philosophers attempting to find the best and most equitable way to organize a society's government and economy. Sadly some of those offshutes resulted in evil regimes and systems.

All of this is well documented. I really can't grasp how you can even challenge these facts other than you feel uncomfortable that the system you favor now has some unsavory relatives in the family tree.

Arguing about this is like you trying to claim Bill Clinton wasn't a Democrat. 

I really don't know what else to say. A lot of people get confused by socialism and the Nazis because during WWII the Soviets were at war with them. Some assume that because the Soviets were against the Nazis that the Nazis must have been political polar opposites. Confusion also comes from the creation of the whole Left wing Right wing political spectrum of the French Parliament and where various politicians sat. People incorrectly assume that the spectrum of the French Parliament at the time represents the entirety of the international political spectrum we have today. 

In other words what was considered far Right or far Left in the French Parliament then is not necessarily what we would consider as being far Right or Far Left today.

Again, I don't know how you could even argue this historical fact. I suggest you take some college level political science and history classes. Being ignorant or intentionally misinformed will not serve you in life.

Good luck 




 That would explain their sexual habits 




 Hitler viewed the Communists and other socialist groups as competitors for the same power goal. He disliked Communism because of its international focus and high Jewish membership.

Simply because he and Mussolini were socialists does not make then automatically like other socialists or any other political group. 

I really don't know why you are fighting this fact so much. It's an historical fact. There is no debate here. 




 Sorry but the Nazis and Fascists were both socialists. 

"The truth is incontrovertible, malice may attack it, ignorance may deride it, but in the end; there it is." -Winston Churchill

 




 Sorry but the Nazis were the German National Socialist Worker's party. Hitler was a prolific socialist writer and philosopher. He rejected Communism because he felt it was too slow and contained too many Jews. The Nazis' social, economic, and political policies were main stream socialism. 

High taxation merely takes money away from productive job creators and gives it to government which usually squanders it on wasteful projects. You are assuming that the country thrived during high taxation periods as being the cause for economic expansion. 

You really need to get a basic education. You will never succeed living off of false assumptions and silly slogans. The world just doesn't work that way. 




 You are mistakenly attributing any "good" or beneficial policy with a being Progressive policy. 

What do you think the end game of progressivism is? Ultimately, will we or won't we end up in a socialist state? Be honest.  




 The Tea Party wants LIMITED taxation not NO taxation.

It is an historical fact that the Nazis and the Fascists were socialists. Your definition in no way contradicts that except its incorrect claim that Fascism was "Right Wing".

The false claim that the Nazis and Fascists were right wing comes from WWII when the Soviets were at war with them. The Soviets and the Nazis and Fascists were all socialists but different, competing forms. 

Again, please take some survey classes in political science at your local community college.  




 Simply put, the EPA is supposed to enforce environmental laws that have been approved by Congress and signed into law by the president.

The EPA instead constantly expands their influence by creating law under the rubric of environmental protection. They do so without regard for the economic effects of those regulations. They do so without legal authority to do so (can't create statutes). Their policies destroy entire industries (see coal, nuclear, etc}. 

BTW Barnes cartridges are 3x as expensive as lead based cartridges are. Biofuel is available. It is more expensive than diesel or gasoline. Why aren't YOU driving a bio fuel car? Why isn't YOU home heated with biofuel? Hypocrite

 




 I am not against all regulation. I am against the endless expansion of regulation. Case in point: During the 70's the EPA created very helpful regulations on clean water and pollution. Since then, they have attempted to regulate anything even remotely relating to the environment.

These new regulations are very expensive to comply with, they are of dubious and often no value to the environment, the new regulations don't take into account economic impacts when imposed, the EPA oversteps into areas that should be regulated by congress, the EPA regulations often involve political or philosophical agendas rather than environmental protection.

Just this week, a judge ruled that the EPA can't regulate lead bullets. If the EPA had been allowed to do that then they would have unilaterally infringed on the people's 2nd amendment rights.   

 




 Tea Party is not against ALL taxation, it is against endlessly raising taxes so government can endlessly expand and regulate. Please stop misquoting the Tea Party's goals 




 Forcing everyone into socialized health care to provide medical services is like  forcing everyone into public housing projects to solve housing challenges. 




 Socialism is a political and economic system characterized by having a planned economy, where the government controls the means of production in a government centric society at the expense of individual goals and freedom.

Fascism (and Naziism) were both forms of socialism. Not in just name but in goals and in practice. I strongly suggest you attend some college courses before you continue to discuss political science.   




 Me 




 Huh? What are you talking about? 




 No, the Tea Party stands for lower taxes, smaller government, and less regulation. It is about making government have a smaller impact on the people's lives and giving the people greater freedom.

Your list is a simplistic infantilization of the Tea Party's goals. We view the progressive Left as false prophets of the poor and the middle class. The Left's goal is only socialism, plain and simple.  




 I can assure you that the Tea Party will oppose any progressive legislation proposed by ANY politician of any sex or race. Why is it so hard to grasp that we oppose the policies. The Left's political ideology is diametrically opposed to our political philosophy. We believe progressivism is not simply a desire to make things better but rather a rigid path towards socialism and ruin for the US. It's that simple. The Left lies and claims that race is involved.

 is Obama a Marxist, Communist, Socialist, or Fascist? Can't be all of them

All of the political systems named above are socialist systems so Obama indeed could be a Marxist/Communist or a fascist.  




 No, I am saying that the gas/oil industries have been fracking for almost 100 years and that any pollutants that get injected deep underground quickly turn into iron oxide AKA rust and are totally harmless and have never caused ground water pollution. Science

 As a Tea Party Conservative I can say that I am opposed to almost every "progressive" policy proposed by anyone. The insinuation that the GOP is opposing Obama simply because he is black is  completely false.  




 Fracking has been done for almost 100 years.  




 http://i.imgur.com/qrpS6vX.gif 




 The people opposed to fracking are opposed to it for philosophical reasons that are independent from any factual basis. Even if fracking (or any other fossil fuel technology) were 100% completely safe and risk free, they would oppose it.  




 Leftists never debate facts, they only shoot the messenger 




 You obviously do not understand what Atwater was saying. He was saying that the GOP could attract disillusioned Dixiecrat voters with economic appeals rather than racist appeals. 

You really need to see the interview again and really try to grasp what was said.

Please also read this link. http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2013/04/the-southern-strategy-debunked-again.php 




 Can you offer proof that the current GOP is racist?  




 So we both agree that the GOP is no more racist than the Democrat Party. 




 The Southern Strategy has been proven false. The migration of southern democrat voters did not happen suddenly as a result of the civil rights act being passed. The migration was a decades long process due to the Democrat Party turning left and moving away from American values.

There is no evidence whatsoever that the GOP adopted racism or embraced racism.

  




 Democrats supported slavery, started the KKK, supported segregation, initiated Jim Crow Laws, opposed the civil rights act.  




 Damn Democrats and their Jim Crow laws. 




 After the volcano on Krakatoa exploded in 1883, Muslims there attacked and killed non Muslims. Muslims have attacked and killed thousands of people in countries all over the world. It seems as if the problem is not happenstance or environmental. The problem seems to be institutional and cultural. My issue is that you and others that think like you simply can't recognize or accept that all cultures, religions, peoples are not the same.    




 all the horrors in the world are committed by people through pure happenstance 

Please read what you just wrote. Can you seriously believe that? 

If you were to honestly view the history of Muslim extremists motivated to intentionally kill in the name of their religion, you would see that happenstance has had nothing to do with those acts.

 




 Thanks! 




 I am reading his book "Gulag Archipelago". I could not find a better cite. I am looking for the actual page number now.   




 I tire of people like you who simply cannot distinguish/differentiate/discriminate between the actions of two groups of people and feel the need to place both groups in the same moral basket. The USA and the Nazis killed thousands of people during WWII but they did so for different reasons. They are not two sides of the same coin.

 Muslim extremists have been engaging in terrorist and violent acts for centuries and against every culture they interact with. Islam is a religion based on conquest and subjugation of their rivals. Radical Islamists have been involved in thousands of religious based violent attacks in just the past 20 years. http://www.thereligionofpeace.com/index.html#Attacks (follow links to yearly lists)

The only reason the US is engaged in violent action against Muslim extremists is because they simply won't leave us alone. They have already declared war against us unilaterally. 

According to your logic, a robber who enters a store and shoots a clerk and the store owner who defends himself and shoots the robber are moral equivalents because they were both shooters engaged in violence.

If you cannot see the difference between the two or the difference between what the US does and what Muslim extremists do then you are indeed being juvenile and naive and engaged in wishful thinking.  




 No because you are replacing critical thought, logical analysis, cause and effect with juvenile wishful thinking.  




 Yes. Naive and silly 




 You are a despicable, simplistic person.  




 This being reddit, I am surprised no one has made a snarky response such as "It is your wife. Pic taken at Motel 6 down by the interstate" 




 No. Gun ownership is a civil right that shouldn't be restricted by special interest backed politicians 




 I honestly don't care if terrorists are tortured by Bush or drone killed by Obama. F*ck them all 




 I have no idea what you are trying to say. I assume you misunderstood my previous comment 




  one could argue that, in general, conservatives only disagree on how quickly we should approach fascism

Fascism was a socialist political movement. I highly doubt many on the right would push for such a system.

Also the Democrat Party is being led to its ultimate path towards real socialism. Everyday Democrat voters are being falsely led to believe that the party only seeks an general progress towards a better future. 




  legitimizing torture and killings without due process

Obama can end this today. He supports drone killing without due process (I personally agree with his policy)

 restricting choices and education concerning reproduction

The abortion statutes in the EU are much more restrictive than the USA. (I personally don't give a shit about abortion either way)

invading other countries to steal their natural resources

Can you offer any proof that that has happened? Ever?

restricting human rights to only exist for whites and/or christian

Can you offer any proof that that has happened? Ever?

putting people in prison for what they do to their own bodies.

If you are referring to drugs, both parties have supported the war on drugs for a century

I don't like the world-conquest size of the defence budget, the complete neglect of how we are rapidly destroying the planet

The US defense budget keeps sea lanes open allowing world commerce. The US guarantees the security of the EU, Canada, and many other countries in the world. When there is a natural disaster, it is the US military that always offers assistance. 

Can you name a country that is a better steward of the environment?   




 Your definition of Liberalism is the traditional one such as could be used to describe JFK. Today Liberalism is simply a path towards a socialist end game. Notice how the left never has any disagreements on policy? Everyone on the Left is following a strict, static, rigid ideology. The only debates I see on the Left is an occasional debate regarding gun control and a debate on how fast we should proceed down the path towards socialism.

On the right there are many debates and factions such as Establishment GOP, RINO's, Libertarians, Tea Party Conservatives 




 disposed to preserve existing conditions, institutions, etc., or to restore traditional ones, and to limit change.

Yes as in the presence of government in our lives. I want less government, lower taxes, less regulation. The correct definition is a rolling back of most Liberal policies of the past 40 years. Most, not all. 




 Very naive of you to say that. I am a Tea Party Conservative and I reject everything the left favors. I view them as a cancer on the country and will resist every policy they hope to implement. Why do I oppose the Left so vehemently? Because their policies differ so much from the Right's   




 Progressivism and socialism are merely different paths to the same destination. Ultimately both lead to a world controlled by self appointed elites that know better than you do how you should live your life.  




 Can you please tell me what the end game of progressivism is? Is it or isn't it ultimately socialism? 




 You and other Liberals make the same mistake of confusing what political parties actually stand for.

Progressives are not promoting a general progression towards a better world. Progressivism is a strict, methodical march towards garden variety socialism. The end result is a society run by self appointed elites.

Conservatism is not an attempt to conserve tradition or the past. Conservatism is the desire to keep government small because as government expands, the personal liberty and freedom of the people must necessarily be limited.   




 No clue what you are referring to. Conservatives only want the government to tax us less, spend less, and be less of a nanny state 




 False, I attended a Dave Bratt  (he beat Eric Cantor) function there and the religious people I met were polite and respectful. They are religious, good for them. I am an atheist, good for me. We all got along just fine. No bibles, no snake handling, no drinking of strictnine. 




 That's how they serve chocolate milk 




 He made no comments regarding gay marriage so you really can't claim to know what position he would take. Both Obama and Hillary were against gay marriage a couple of years ago. 

As a Tea Party Conservative, I don't care who marries who.

Jefferson invaded Libya and kept US Marines there for several years

War on drugs has been pursued by both parties for 100 years. Obama could end it today if he so desired. 

 




 I am a hardcore Tea Party Conservative and I don't give a shit who you marry. I grew up middle class and have been poor in my life. I got educated and started my own business. Even when I was poor I still rejected the Progressive message because I knew that Progressivism was a fraud. It was not a path towards a general betterment of society but rather a specific march towards socialism and government control over the people by self proclaimed elites. 

 




 The GOP is made up of many factions: Establishment RINOs, Tea Party Conservatives, Libertarians, Religious Right etc. The Religious right make up only 10% of the party. I have no friction with the religious right other than thinking they may be a distraction from our core message of limited taxation and less governmental control over the people.

I feel the bigger problem is the Left's disingenuous claims and outright lies regarding the GOP as being religious racists. I am a hardcore Tea Party Conservative who is active in politics and I simply never encounter the intolerant bible thumpers and racist/homophobic/misogynistic  types the Left always claims makes up the Right.

 




 Why do Liberals view the Right as evil? We on the right are not evil or insincere or anti anyone. We simply reject progressive socialist policy and embrace a more traditional Jeffersonian philosophy.

 I never made any comments on her article. Please stop trying to change the subject which is Elizabeth Warren's history and pattern of dishonesty and placing her goals above the people's needs.  




 It's not Ad hominem because it is not simply a meaningless attack of Warren for being a bitch. It is a criticism of a necessary requirement for leadership. I demand all leaders be trustworthy and not place their goals ahead of the people's needs. 

Warren has a documented history of lying. Even her husband lied about being a Native American too. 

Please look at this chart:

This is the relative Warren claimed made her Native American. As you can see her claim is a total fabrication.

 According to the US Government Printing Office, the US tax code is 16,845 pages long. I don't know about you but I view that as grossly excessive. Those regs apply to someone.... 




  It is human nature that most people and corporations will seek to pay the least amount of taxes. Even if revenues stay the same, there is a benefit from making the paying of taxes fair and easy.

The tax system as it stands today is too complex and politically abusive.  




  Taxes are ridiculously low in this country especially if you're a person who invests.

http://www.kpmg.com/global/en/services/tax/tax-tools-and-resources/pages/corporate-tax-rates-table.aspx

(USA taxes are highest in the world) 




 How do we collect taxes made overseas today? How do other countries handle that? Obviously this is not an impossible task.  




 Brain food. Literally  




  Defining the price of intellectual property is notoriously difficult

Difficult does not equal impossible.

B is overseas. Are you saying we'll tax overseas subsidiaries of US companies?

Companies will always flock to lower tax havens ( see recent Burger King/Tim Horton's merger). 

If the US has lower tax rates then companies will migrate more operations here. 

Compare what US companies pay in taxes today with the current tax code vs a proposed flat tax of 15% and how international income is taxed. 




 Any increase in gross income generated would be taxable. Companies could play any accounting games they wished but if income increased then that amount would be subject to the flat tax. 

A sells off it's intellectual property to B

Difference between base cost and sale price is taxable income.

B rents back it's intellectual property to A for an amount of money equal to what A's gross revenue would otherwise be

Rent received is taxable income 




 Everyone (people and all business structures including trusts and non profits) pays 15% on gross income from all sources derived. No deductions, exceptions, or loopholes.  




 Blind people can't physically see a school test. Are you saying that poor people have a physical impediment from paying the same relative percentage of their income as other classes? 




 So you think the poor are not as capable as the richer classes? 




 So you are against equitable taxation? You are against everyone paying their fair share? You only want income redistribution comrade? 




 http://i.imgur.com/qrpS6vX.gif 




 http://i.imgur.com/Eaz3lJC.jpg 




 Consider a law that required every person and corporation to pay a flat tax of say 15%. No deductions, no loopholes, no other procedures. Wouldn't that be a fairer and cheaper way to collect taxes?

We need to collect taxes. That is fine. It's the method of collection that leads to abuse and inequity  




 Boogie nights....and days 




 Way too many stores would sell feminine hygiene products 




 Lou Gehrig died of Lou Gehrig's disease.

How did he not see that coming? 




 In many third world countries, toilet paper is dropped at the side of the toilet and collected each day to be burned

http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/individualProfile.asp?indid=977

Now, dispute these facts if you can. The educated debate. Fools just laugh.

Also, the difference between Soros and the Kochs is that Soros thinks he has it too easy ~ that he's not being asked for enough, while the Kochs use their money and influence to further the idea that they are asked too much.

Can you see the difference?

I have no clue what you are even saying or asking.

I bet you Jesus could!

I am an atheist so I don't have a clue what Jesus believed  




  Reagan started a war on unions in his first year in office

War? He fired a bunch of PATCO union air traffic controllers because they were not legally allowed to strike and they did so anyway.

And what is with Liberals and the Kochs? I am a Tea Party Conservative and the Kochs have no influence on anything. They are rich guys who make donations. Good for them. I bet you think Soros and Steyer are just concerned citizens and deserve a pass. They don't use their money to buy elections and influence legislation do they?

 




 You are 100% wrong. The only portion of the middle class that the New Deal created was from hiring government bureaucracy employees.

May I suggest you read a book on US History? Your knowledge on the subject is based on Liberal ideology and not historical fact.  




 "Records show Roberson has been arrested several times in the past for robbery, burglary and theft. According to the preliminary report, Gould and Roberson are from California. The report states a search warrant was obtained for Robersons vehicle. Police said they found a stolen bracelet, two handguns, bloody clothes, a bus ticket from Los Angeles to Fort Smith, and a black duffle bag containing duct tape." 




 Saying that the New Deal created the middle class is just about the silliest thing I have heard in a long time. In most human societies, the merchant class created the middle class. The New Deal created two types of jobs: some manual labor, low paying jobs and government employee jobs.

It was WWII industrial production and expansion that brought the US out of the Depression. It was industrial and business expansion that expanded the middle class.


Your example proved my point exactly. Thank you. 




 Democrat economics in a nutshell involves the government stimulating consumer consumption by giving money to the public sector via building projects, public agencies, or simply handouts. 

Conservative economics in a nutshell is to make the cost of doing business less via tax cuts and less regulatory expense. When businesses have more money they will stimulate the economy by expanding and increased hiring.

The Democrat method helps unions and special interest groups and works only so long as the money is flowing.

The Conservative method is superior because lower costs for business creates sustainable economic stimulus.
 
To paraphrase an old saying: Democrat economics is like giving a man a fish and allowing him to eat for a day. Conservative economics is like teaching a man how to fish so he can eat everyday.  




 I travel extensively throughout the Southern US and most people are middle class. You really need to get out more often and not rely on your own prejudices. 

EU can afford a lot of socialist policies because the US provides military security for them. They also rely on Germany to support the poor countries such as Portugal, Spain, Ireland, and Greece. 




 The Left only offers "solutions" that result in higher taxes and empowerment of elites. They NEVER offer anything else.  




 Thomas Jefferson used to be called a liberal because he was open to new ideas and was a pragmatist. Today the term Liberal only means a slavish adherence to Leftist ideology. The open mindedness and the pragmatism have completely vanished from Liberalism.  




 Do you really believe that? JFK was about where George W Bush was in domestic policy and in foreign policy. 




 The Left is simply extreme Marxism.

 Do Liberals really believe that the Democrats are creating jobs? The number of Americans who are even participating in the job market has declined in every month since Obama became president.

 These miniature helicopters are tiny, being 10x2.5 cm (4x1 inch) aircraft that are battery powered, very quiet and can stay in the air for 20 minutes per sortie.

A complete set (two UAVs and the controller) weighs less than a kilogram (2.2 pounds).

 The socialist elements of Naziism were purged in the Night of the Long Knives.

Communists yes but the Nazis were socialists and viewed Communists as competitors. Hitler did not like Communists because they were too internationally focused and had too many Jews as members.

Regardless of the rumors of the Nazi leadership's beliefs, they still had to mobilize the Christian German population.

How does mobilizing Christian support make the Nazis Christian?

The reasons for choosing Jews as the scapegoat are probably complex, but antisemitism has a long history in Europe, and its almost undeniably religious in origin.

Antisemitism has a long history, there is no evidence that the Nazis were influenced into antisemitism by any Christian doctrine.

 









 Both of those things were true of the Nazis. Can you offer ANY proof to the contrary? Please provide historical evidence. 




 A lot of people have that opinion, or at least that their motives are hardly in line with any popular interpretation of Islam. I could say they are to Muslim extremism what the Nazi party was to Christian extremism. 

ISIS is motivated 100% by extremist Muslim views. The Nazis were socialists and  atheists and were not influenced by the Christian religion at all. 

Perhaps the military budget is being cut because drones are supplanting many of the roles our military has been serving in the region. 

How can you suggest that? Drones are great as an adjunct tool to combat terrorists and I support their use but they are not replacements for a strong and supported military. Obama has pursued huge cuts in the military and pursued policies that have allowed ISIS to expand and the losses of Libya, Yemen, and most of Iraq and Syria to Muslim extremists.  




 I can confirm that there are lots of attorneys who are psychopaths   




 He was facing re-election in 2011. The Patriot Act via the NSA gave Obama useful tools unrelated to anti terror goals. 

What is your point on Muslim extremism?

Obama won't even admit that Muslim extremism even exists. How do you explain that fact? Obama claims ISIS is not motivated by religion. What? 

 




 Interventionist strong military

He has cut the military's budget drastically. How effective has he been regarding Libya, Iraq, ISIS, Syria, Iran, Afghanistan, Yemen, Boko Harum etc etc etc? Other than drones, how could  you even claim Obama favors the military or is interventionist?

continuation of Bush domestic terror policies

See above

more money on the border

Huh? Do you realize he has directed ICE and Homeland Security to open the borders? Remember all of the refugees from central America?

Guantanamo is still open 

Many prisoners have been released and returned to Jihad

 taxes weren't raised

Ever hear of Obamacare?

the deficit is lower

Hahahahahahahaha. thanks, I needed a good laugh! 




 Although he voted to extend the act it was a political move. His actions and policies regarding boarder security and failure to even admit Muslim extremism exists shows his security policy views in action.

 I do not accept your claims. The facts don't support you. Also the EU is a very different place with a very different economy than the US. US military spending in Europe and dependance on German loans to name a few examples. 




 Very few poor people are hiring these days. Like it or not, wealth is necessary to create jobs in the amounts needed to increase employment. Can you please explain how the recent government stimulus helped anyone except political allies of Mr Obama? Did the middle class gain anything? 




 Except government does not give $500 tax credits. Instead, government stimulus involves large payments to political allies such as union building projects. Very few industries benefit as a result to the extent that it warrants expansion. 

Supply side economics views tax cuts and regulatory relief as tools that stimulate industries because they know their fixed costs will be less and predictable. This stimulates them to expand to both capture a larger market share of existing markets and expand into new markets. 

The fact is that Keynesian economic models only stimulate limited parts of the economy and do so for very limited periods. Businesses are unlikely to invest capital to expand when they know that government stimulus is temporary.   




  SHORT RUN during recessions that money spent by govt may stimulate the economy.

Yet that never happens.

Industry does not invest capital and expand based on an anticipated short run boost of public sector spending. They know that such a boost will be tiny and very temporary.  




 I did it my way (until I broke my hip) 




 I await your economics explanation as to why I am wrong. Until then you offer nothing to the conversation. 




 I agree that the possibility for abuse could be high. As a purely economic business model, a special status membership level, a "Reddit Platinum" membership which required members to pay $10 per month would possibly make Reddit lots of cash. Such a deal might hurt Reddit if it drove membership away though.  









 There is no such thing as trickle down economics or voodoo economics. 

Supply side economics in a nutshell is the belief that making industry cheaper via less regulation and lower taxes stimulates expansion and increased hiring. 

Keynesian (aka Liberal) economics  in a nutshell is the belief that public spending stimulates expansion and increased hiring. 

Both theories are based on the belief that giving cash to either the public or private sector will improve the economy. 

If one is against supply side economics then they must also be against Keynesian economics.  Both are "trickle down" economic models

  "American rape WWII"

WWII was a brutal war that involved millions of combatants. Rapes were bound to occur by and against all citizens involved. Clearly though, the number of rapes committed by allied soldiers were perpetrated by a tiny minority. The rapes committed by the soviets were widespread and systematic. They were part of a policy of revenge. The two allied side's rape histories during WWII cannot be considered equal  




 Can you offer any proof of that? The Soviet rape and pillaging have been well documented. 




 As the war ended, not all allies responded to German civilians equally. American, French, and English troops were respectful for the most part. Russian troops on the other hand engaged in a massive campaign of revenge rape on any German female found regardless of age.

 Republicans are not anti science. Republicans are anti politicization of science such as not believing in phoney climate change taxation schemes.  




 I think anyone who does not vaccinate their kids is crazy or misinformed. The media seems to want to make the anti vaccination issue as somehow part of the false claim that the GOP is anti science. I was merely showing that the issue is not politically based.  




 Historically, socialism has caused  the deaths of over one hundred  million innocent people over the past century. Enforcement of socialist policies by socialist governments has required the use of terror and violence.   

If you were taught that socialism has been a success then your teachers have been teaching political indoctrination and not history.

All one has to do is compare western style representative governments with socialist governments to see which system is superior in terms of improving the human condition and human life.

Just honestly compare the facts. 




 Thank you for responding. I suspected you were young because of your previous comments. As a student of history with college/university several degrees, I encourage you to continue your education. History is a fascinating subject as it offers a clue of what we can expect of the future. That clue only exists though if we search for facts and not political indoctrination.

The study of socialism is an interesting field but one that is rife with political falsehoods. If that aspect of history interests you then you should pursue it further with an eye towards avoiding non factual political influences.

Socialism has failed miserably wherever it has been tried. As an Aussie, you should honestly compare the histories of socialist states with your own productive and fair society.  




 Nic, does it ever get tiring having to filter your reports through a PC filter rather than just reporting what you see?  




 I am curious, what level of education have you achieved? I am not asking  to mock you. 




 haha what? Mussolini and Hitler were facists, the exact opposite of communists.

Hitler and Mussolini were fascists AND socialists. Fascism and Naziism were forms of socialism. Nether were Communists and both viewed Communists as socialist rivals.

Pol Pot was not a marxist

He was a socialist though

 He (Castro) liberated Cuba from a dictator and now Cubans enjoy a higher standard of living and longer life expectancy than any country in south and central America.

Then why are so many Cubans risking their lives to escape Cuba? Why does Cuba need a secret police or political prisons? Why are Cubans prevented from freely associating, protesting, and traveling out of the country?

Mao was an interesting guy, but I'm curious why you would think he is bad?

Please look up Mao's "cultural revolution" and other socialist policies  http://necrometrics.com/20c5m.htm#Mao 




 Socialism is a system that looks good on paper but always fails in practice because ultimately, the state must use coercion and violence to force everyone to comply. The Soviets had to use violence and starvation to enforce compliance to socialist policies, Mao had to kill millions in his cultural revolution to enforce compliance to socialist policies, the killing fields of Cambodia was likewise a policy of purifying society by eliminating those who opposed Pol Pot's socialist paradise.

The bottom line is that socialist systems use violence to eliminate any counter revolutionary individuals or populations that may oppose them.  




 Forced collectivization in the Soviet Union under Stalin.

The killing fields under Pol Pot

Mao's cultural revolutions

 




 Those deaths were directly related to the implementation and enforcement of socialist policies. In other words, if Germany, Italy, Russia, Cuba, Cambodia had been ruled by democracies or representative governments then the vast majority of those deaths would have been averted.   




 I define socialism as a political/economic system characterized by a planned economy, non private control over the means (and distribution) of production , and a government/community centric society at the  expense of individual liberty.

That definition encompasses the Soviets, the Maoists, the Nazis, and the Fascists. Each form of socialism has its unique qualities but they all retain the same core elements.  




 Actually, 100 million people died as a direct result of socialist policies or because they opposed socialist policies. They didn't all just commit suicide did they?  




 http://www.nationalreview.com/article/372197/nazis-still-socialists-jonah-goldberg 




 They were still all socialists 




 Stalin was a socialist

Mao was a socialist

Castro was a socialist

Pol Pot was a socialist

Hitler was a socialist

Mussolini was a socialist

All together they are responsible for the deaths of over 100 million people over the past century.

Maybe socialism IS bad 




 The theory behind these weird speed limit signs such as this one is that drivers would ignore a speed limit sign with a common low MPH limit such as 20MPH but that 9 1/2 MPH is so odd that drivers would actually notice and respond compliantly.  




 If you read Marx and Engels, you will see that socialism is a transitional phase of government that precedes Communism. 

In other words, socialism is a preliminary step that societies evolve through after they pass from agrarian systems, to industrial/capitalist systems, and ultimately into Communism. It is only during the final Communism stage that society evolves into a state were non private ownership of the means of production is complete. 

by definition having the cronies of government own and control all the means of production is fascism. 

Socialist systems merely have to have non private control over the means of production. Control does not require outright ownership of the means of production.  Socialism allows  keeping some industries in private hands during the transitional phase from capitalism to communism but those private hands are ultimately controlled by the government.

Again, Marx wrote that socialism  is a continuum. It is an evolutionary process that societies travel through from serfdom through capitalism and ultimately communism. 

 




 I stand ready to debate you with historical facts and proof. You only want to slink away in defeat. 

You obviously want to quit because you know that your claims are false. 

I deal in facts, You deal in faith.  




 Sorry but your collection of pictures are not Tea Party related. Only one picture has a tea party flag. None of the other pictures provide any proof that they are from Tea Party events or created by the Tea Party or its members. Many of the signs aren't even racist. If the Tea Party is as racist as you claim then there should be countless examples of Tea Party racism. Such examples simply do not exist.

For the record, the Tea Party stands for three things: Lower taxes, less government, less regulation. That's it. Racism has nothing what so ever to do with the Tea Party. As you will see, the Tea Party will continue to oppose any Progressive policies regardless of the race of the Democrat who proposes them.

As for the Nazis and the Fascists, both movements were forms of socialism.  Hitler and Mussolini were both ardent socialists. Both viewed their particular version of socialism as being superior to the various forms of socialism then offered. Hitler opposed Communism because he felt it was too slow, internationally focused and contained too many Jews.

You fail to consider in your analysis the facts that socialism does not require actual ownership of the means of production but can control the means of production via crony capitalism, regulation, and  favoritism. Both Nazis Germany and Fascist Italy exhibited all of the core elements of classical socialism such as a planned economy, control over the means (and distribution) of production, and a government centric community based society at the expense of individual liberty.  

People often wrongly confuse Naziism and Fascism as being right wing movements. That claim only makes sense if one's political spectrum is made up of only socialistic movements. 

Please read this article as it lays out the historical facts that the Nazis and the Fascists were indeed true and actual practicing socialists.

 Sorry but there is no proof of that. Simply photos. 

 




 Can you please explain when that happened? 




 How do these links involve the Tea Party? How do we know who these sign wavers are?

And regarding your other comment,  the Fascists and the Nazis were socialists

I was not there so I am not trying to criticize. I just know that drawing on someone or shooting them, even if 100% justified, will open up a Costco sized can of worms that will likely not be pleasant for everyone involved.  




 I may be wrong but I think OP may have exacerbated the situation by playing dumb and asking the guy why he was angry. Obviously the guy was angry because his car was blocked by OP's bike. OP knew his bike was blocking guy's car and that was the only reason he was angry. It seems as if OP may have been trying to bait the guy by leaving bike there for longer than necessary.

If I were investigating this situation I would have asked both if they had had any previous negative encounters with each other. I would ask why the delay in moving the bike. I would ask why bike was not stored in front of OP's car rather than requiring him to move it every time he wanted to use his car.

 I may be 100% wrong but something does not add up here.  














  What is the rate? 

The rate of increase? Is it significant in terms of being a major factor in climate change? 




   rate of increase in global emissions that stalled.

What is the rate? Is that rate significant?

This is only from the energy sector. Not the transportation or construction (i.e. cement) sectors.

A flatline in one major sector is significant. If there was a relationship between world economies and CO2 levels then ANY increase or decrease from any CO2 producing economic sector should effect general ambient CO2 levels.

 The reasons Conservatives and the GOP are against climate change is  because:

1. We believe that Leftist political interests have corrupted climate science.

2. Saying that an area of science "is settled" is contrary to the scientific method.

3. The proposed solutions to climate change by the Left involve increasing taxes, increasing regulation, and empowering elites. These so called solutions are extremely expensive and any results achieved would be miniscule and not guaranteed.  




 Al citizens whether Conservative, Liberal, or in between should oppose this type of legislation.

 Southern Strategy:

The Southern strategy is often misunderstood because of an interview with Lee Atwater in which he uses the term "nigger nigger". Some who do not understand what he is saying consider this snippet to mean the GOP is embracing racism to attract disaffected Dixiecrat voters.

That assumption is incorrect. What Atwater was saying in plain English was that the GOP DOES NOT have to resort to pleas to racism to attract disenchanted southern democrat voters. The GOP had to only appeal to economic issues to attract them. 

The link I provided proved that there was no Southern Strategy to use racism because the data proved that the shift of southern democrats to the GOP was NOT as a result of the civil rights movement. The shift was a long continuous 4 decade process.

Please consider the logic of this. Why would any party embrace a tiny portion of the voting public (racists) at the expense of offending 95+ percent of the voting public? Such a strategy would doom a party to failure.  

If conservatives are so opposed to big government and government spending

You have to realize that the GOP does not equal Conservative. The GOP consists of several factions including big spending establishment RINOs such as McCain, Christie, Bush, etc, the Tea Party Conservatives than want smaller, less expensive, less intrusive government, Libertarians etc. 

Conservative Tea Party opposes expansion of government regardless of if it is proposed by the Left or the establishment wing of the GOP. 

equate socialism to communism which its not.

According to Marx, socialism is an intermediary step on the political continuum towards communism. All socialists aren't communists but all communists are socialist. As a Conservative, I oppose all forms of socialism or communism. 

You need to study some history man. Europe has thrived under social democracy so has canada.

Are you including the noted socialist regimes of the Soviet Union, Maoist China, Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge, Hitler's nazis Germany, Castro's Cuba, Mussolini's Italy? Those regimes are responsible for the deaths of 150 million people over the past century.

Please don't confuse full socialist states with socialist lite systems such as Scandinavia or Canada. Such systems can afford social welfare because they are rich countries who do not have to pay for their military security. Such states are not paradises. They are dealing with very real economic issues, declining population, and a deteriorating immigration policy that allows non integrating outsiders to change their societies. Such systems are not likely to survive.

I believe that the Tea Party movement is a response to a black man in the Oval Office and conservative appeasement of these whack jobs has done a serious disservice to the right. I used to consider myself a centrist until people like Michelle Bachman and Sarah Palin hijacked the gop and all the Anti-scientific and pro-religious sentiments were amplified and became central to the party.

  1. Can you provide proof that the Tea Party is racist? No such proof exists.

 The Tea Party stands for 3 things:

Lower taxes, less regulation, and smaller government.

I am a hard core Tea Party Conservative. I am also an atheist, a scientist, I don't give a shit who smokes what or who marries who. 

Conservatives are not anti science. We believe that the issue of climate change has become polluted with political ideology and thus the data can't be trusted. The solutions to climate change proposed by the Left involve massive tax increases and empowerment of elites. 

Conservatives believe Liberals are wrong.

Liberals believe Conservatives are evil.  




 The first thing I'd like to say is look up the Republican southern strategy. It is an openly racist policy that is denied or spun by conservatives but their policies don't match their words.

Southern strategy claim debunked:
http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2013/04/the-southern-strategy-debunked-again.php

More white people are on welfare, food stamps etc than minorities

37.6% of food stamps were being allotted to White non-Hispanics. African Americans were allotted 23.6% of SNAP benefits. 


http://www.fns.usda.gov/sites/default/files/2012Characteristics.pdf


Welfare statistics. Black and white percentages are essentially equal at 39%

http://www.statisticbrain.com/welfare-statistics/

Being opposed to socialist, Leftist, Progressive policies does not equate to racism.

Conservatives are opposed to a huge government constantly getting bigger, taxing more, and making regulations endlessly. We view power as a zero sum game. Power is finite and with every right or freedom the government takes over, the less rights and power the people have to decide their own destinies. 

Not directly but conservative policy would effectively strip or limit the country of its social safety net

We want smaller government not no government. Liberals always play this false all or nothing claim. We feel that economic opportunities are far better for all people than endless government subsidy slavery.

So you don't judge policy on its merits you judge it on its political leaning or political class that proposes it.

We are philosophically opposed to Leftist policies. Period. I do not view Leftist policies as being beneficial to the country or our people. I view Leftism as a cancer on society, government, and the people. This does not mean I am against helping the truly needy with government assistance. I simply reject Leftist government turning entire classes of people into dependent slaves to social welfare programs. 

You sound like your indoctrinated as opposed to having a political affiliation. Any thing that is from us is good, anything that is from them is bad. You don't see the problem in this?

This comes down to political philosophy. I follow the beliefs of the founding fathers, classical liberals but not Leftist Liberals. I view today's Liberal progressive Left as being a static, rigid path to classical socialism... nothing more. 

As a Conservative I believe that America offers a different path towards raising all members of society economically, politically, socially, personally. Socialism is diametrically opposed to my political, economic, and personal goals. Socialism has been a disaster for  every society that has tried it historically. There is a reason for that failure. Please consider why it has failed in the past....

I'm not gonna bombard you with a battle of links because I'm sure you realize we can both find Internet sources to back up anything we say. I'm trying to keep things on a general level. I'm not a hater and I'm not looking to trash you or your beliefs.

Thank you

 More white people are on welfare, food stamps etc than minorities. 

Being opposed to socialist, Leftist, Progressive policies does not equate to racism. 

I and other Conservatives are opposed to almost ANY progressive policy and ANY progressive politician. Race, sex, religion, orientation is totally irrelevant. 

If Hillary becomes president, I will oppose almost everything she proposes. If Al Gore becomes president I will oppose almost everything he proposes. Same with ANY other Democrat/Leftist/progressive. 

It is my belief that the whole GOP=racism is a Democrat lie, intentionally told in order to stifle debate of issues. Democrat philosophy is to demonize opponents so that voters don't even have to explore contrary opinions. Why would you even entertain the views of a mean racist?  

If you really don't think the GOP has racist policies you have buried your head in the sand, a quick Google search will not disappoint. I can provide you with direction when I get home.

No crazy opinion pieces please.  




 But "progress" in American politics only means a static march towards classical socialism? Progress does not mean an open minded attempt at finding real working solutions to problems?

Conservatism in American politics means a desire to follow Jeffersonian representative democracy. Embracing those policies that have made the US an economic superpower.    




 How has the GOP been racist? 




 If you actually read that article you will understand that the Democrats did indeed give up their overtly racist policies.

But you will also read that the Republicans did not switch and become racists or support racist policies to win over racist Democrat voters. The so called Southern Strategy is spelled out in a Lee Atwater interview in which he stated that the GOP could appeal to Dixiecrat voters by use of economic arguments and NOT by means of crying "n*gger n*gger". 

http://www.redstate.com/2012/07/11/the-southern-strategy-myth-and-the-lost-majority/

People often misinterpret the Southern Strategy as a point when the GOP switched and became supporters of overt racism. This incorrect belief  has been proven wrong by use of demographic data that show that the migration of Southern Democrat voters to the GOP was not a sudden movement as the result of the civil rights movement. The migration was a slow and steady movement over 4 decades. 

One only has to ask why ANY political party would embrace racism as policy. Such a move would ensure defeat in national elections. The percentage of voters who vote based on racism is astronomically small. The percentage of voters who would be offended by such policies is well into the majority. Logic dictates that no such policy would be followed by any major party.     




 Yes, the Democrats changed their racist history after the civil rights movement. The Republicans have always been against racism as a policy. 




 True the Democrats renounced their overt racism but the Republicans have remained the same 














  Never ever vote D again ever.

 The Tea Party, actual Conservatives are for smaller government, lower taxes, and less government regulation. Put differently, Conservatives are against increasing government influence in our lives.

 The facts of the case is that the IRS paid heightened scrutiny towards conservative non profit groups than liberal non profit groups. This heightened scrutiny was at the orders of the Obama administration.

 Actually, according to Marx, socialism is the step before communism. Marx envisioned a continuum that begins with agrarianism, then to Capitalism, then socialism (by means of Progressivism) and finally Communism.

Your analogy is incorrect. Fascism is a form of socialism. The Nazis were the National Socialist Worker's Party. Hitler was a socialist leader and writer as was Mussolini.   

Any positive accomplishments by Progressives such as child labor laws and worker safety are commendable but that does not change the fact that the ultimate goal of Progessivism is not "what ever works" but a rigid path towards ideological socialism. 

Please read this link that explains Progressivism. The link is thinkprogress.com so you can't say it's biased against the Left. 

http://thinkprogress.org/election/2013/03/22/1761431/what-it-means-to-be-a-progressive-a-manifesto/  

















































 Can you please explain to me where I am wrong? The term "Progressive" certainly does not mean a desire for general improvement of society and the condition of the people. It is a very specific ideological path that ends in socialism.  




 But are we forgetting the part where he was a Progressive? Conservative means something. So does Progressive. They don't mean the same thing.

Progressive does not mean a general desire to make things better and improve people's lives. Progressivism is a rigid, ideological path to socialism. Dissent is strictly forbidden. Even in TR's time, Progessivism was a rejection of American individualism and personal freedom and the embrace of big government involvement in every aspect of people's lives.

 If the data supported your view you wouldn't need to insult me.

But can you refute the data the link provided as being false? It linked to a demographic study of the shift of the Southern Democrat voters to the GOP. Can you refute that study? 

Am I a liberal? No, i am a republican that is embarrassed that the Tea Party exists.

 I looked at your commenting history. You support Elizabeth Warren. You are simply being deceitful here. Why can't you admit your political beliefs? Are you embarrassed to be a Liberal? Or are you only interested in dishonest demonization of the Tea Party as racists?

The Tea Party is a reaction to  big government, big taxing, big spending politicians of BOTH parties. The Tea Party did not exist when Regan or Bush were president.    




  Don't link redstate.com as a credible source. ever

Can you refute the data and proof that article on Red State links to?

Can a Rightist not assume everyone is a leftist because of a disagreement? 

Are you in fact a Liberal?

"The Tea Party opposes big government period. Race has nothing to do with it" Then why did it not appear during Bush years, and appeared right after we elected a black president?

The Tea Party began as a reaction to big government spending. The Bush administration stoked the fire and the Obama administration caused the fire to explode. Obama's policies such as the ACA and deficit spending of 1 trillion dollars per year were the fuel. His race had nothing whatsoever to do with the rise of the Tea Party. If Hillary or Liz Warren become president you will see just as loud opposition to their policies.  




 Your quote does not explain or prove that the GOP has racist policies, leaders, or members. There is a difference in the parties' political philosophies. Liberals favor big government Conservatives do not. That does not equate to one side being racist and the other side not. 

The South has had a history of racism. The South today is not monolithic politically and in its views on race. In Mobile Alabama, blacks and whites live in the same neighborhoods. In Boston Massachusetts,   blacks and whites live very segregated in white or black communities.  




 Wrong. It's called the Civil Rights Act, and it coincides perfectly with Republicans dominating the South.

The scholarly proof shows that the Dixiecrat migration to the GOP was gradual.
http://www.redstate.com/2012/07/11/the-southern-strategy-myth-and-the-lost-majority/

Why did they not have a problem until a black man became president? and not when George Bush increased federal debt/ spending a shit ton? Or when Reagan did also? Or when ANY FUCKING republican president did it? 

The Tea Party began as a grass roots reaction to free spending politicians of every party Bush, McCain, Obama etc included. The Tea Party opposes big government period. Race has nothing to do with it. If Hillary, or Liz Warren, or Bernie Sanders becomes president, the Tea Party will be just as opposed to their Leftist big government policies. If a big spending Republican like Jeb Bush became president, the Tea Party would oppose him too. 

Edit: Have you EVER taken American History? Your knowledge is lacking severely.

Can a Leftist ever have an adult debate without insulting their opponent?  




 No none denies that racists are a small percentage of all political parties. The Democrats refuted racism and everyone applauds them for it. I just don't see the logic of the conclusion that just because the Democrats refuted a position that the opposition must then embrace that position. Isn't it possible that both parties now don't support racism? We can trade examples of racist behavior by random members of both parties but that does not prove that such an attitude is indicative of how each party feels about racism. 

The claim of GOP racism by the Left is a tactic to stop debate on issues. If those people who don't care about politics and who get their political information from watching Jon Stewart on Comedy Central can be lied to and convinced that the GOP is racist then those voters will never vote Republican regardless of the issue. 




 You can't deny the long and sordid racist history of the Democrat Party. They were the party of slavery and fought to preserve it. They created the KKK, poll taxes, segregation, Jim Crow etc. It was only after the Civil Rights act passed (by members of both parties) that the Democrat Party finally shed the last vestiges of overt racism as an official policy. 

The point of the article was the false claim that the GOP switched with the Democrats and embraced racism.  









 Rather than simply parroting something you heard and don't understand, can you offer anything factual to the debate? Can you refute anything I have written?  




 This has to be the most unscholarly article I have read in a long time. The author writes that the two parties flipped during the 60s through the 80s with the racists Democrats renouncing racism and the GOP embracing it. 

It is true that the Democrats moved to the Left and renounced their long history of overt racism after the Civil Rights Act was passed. It is not true that the GOP in response decided to embrace racism are a policy. The entire article is based on an interview of Lee Atwater nearly 50 years ago. In that interview, Atwater laid out the so called Southern strategy that the author claims proves the racism of the GOP.

First of all, an interview by a political consultant 50 years ago does not speak for the millions of GOP voters  of today.

Secondly, the migration of the Dixiecrat voters from the Democrat Party to the GOP was a gradual transformation that occurred over the course of 40 years. There was no sudden switch in racism from Democrats to GOP.

Thirdly, what Atwater stated is often misunderstood. He was saying that appeals to racism were not necessary as economic issues were far more effective in attracting disaffected Southern Democrats who had soured on the Democrat Party's move to the Left politically.

Fourthly, no party would embrace a  policy such as racism that would attract an insignificant portion of the voting public while at the same time offending the vast majority of the voting public. It simply makes no logical sense. 

Finally, the Tea Party stands for three ideas:  Lower taxation, less regulation, and smaller government. Race, gender, sexual identity, religion have nothing whatsoever to do with the Tea Party. Nothing whatsoever. The Left lies about the Tea Party to demonize it so that debate on the ideas never takes place. The Left lies in order to squelch any discussions. 




 Everyone should Czech it out 
























 So we are left with conflicting data.

As the song says "Two men say they're Jesus, one of them must be wrong"

The bottom line here is that Ted Cruz and the Right base their climate change suspicions based on data. We may be wrong but we are sincere and being scientific. 

Shouldn't this issue be determined using the scientific method of experimentation and reproducible results? Politics has polluted the issue and thus actual facts are often difficult to find.

How could you be against continued experimentation? Certainly scientists do not understand climate science to the point that we can simply stop exploring.
 




 The graph clearly shows that the average temps have not increased statistically during the period shown. I don't know what else to tell you if you can't see that.

Liberalism is an unwavering ideology. Those that adhere to it follow that ideology religiously. Being a Liberal is central to the debate on climate change. Why? Because the solutions proposed by Liberals involves raising taxes, increasing regulations, and empowering elites. These solutions are extremely expensive and promise very little in the lowering of temperatures if successful and do not guarantee any results at all.  

I get my data from here http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/temp-and-precip/msu/ (UAH MSU)

Here is the key data graph: http://blogs-images.forbes.com/warrenmeyer/files/2012/02/15yr-temps.gif

As you can see, the temps have remained statistically flat. This is in direct conflict with all of the models you cite.

Bottom line: if models conflict with actual data then the models are wrong. Period

I will not debate you if you continue to insult me. I will not debate teenagers
 




 http://blogs-images.forbes.com/warrenmeyer/files/2012/02/15yr-temps.gif

Here are actual temp records from http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/temp-and-precip/msu/

The data shows that over the past 17 years the temps have remained statistically flat. These are actual temps. If they differ from any models then the models are wrong. 

BTW I will ignore you if you continue to insult me in your responses. I refuse to debate with teenagers  




 The models have predicted temperature rises and that's what has happened.

Temps have not increased thus all the models predicting an increase have been wrong.  




 I am saying that all of them were incorrect by a great margin.

Can you offer anything to refute this? I tire of Liberals unable to debate anything factually and resort to attacking the person with the opposing viewpoints 




 Can you provide proof that indeed the temps increased .15 degrees per year over the past 17 years? 




 I asked anyone to produce any climate models that have accurately predicted temperatures over the past 15 years. I am saying that all of them were incorrect by a great margin.

 i hope you aren't doing this to incite an emotional response.

No. Why is it that those on the Left can't fathom the fact that people can have differing views without being insincere or being trolls and racists?

i'm not sure what you mean by this question. focus less on what the temperature should be and more on what the side effects are if the temperature reaches certain points.

No the average temps historically are important because they show that temps have varied greatly up and down over the past 100,000 years. This is also true for CO2 levels. What that means is that it is normal for the earth's temps and CO2 levels to very with or without anthropogenic influences.

If we disregard those facts and focus only on possible side effects then we fail as scientists. Using your logic, we should encase the entire country in a steel shield to protect us from meteorites 

Your climate models end at the year 2000... the start of the pause 




 The point is that throughout earth's history, CO2 levels and average temps have gone up and down. In light of that indisputable fact, a temperature increase of .7 degrees over a century is statistically and scientifically insignificant. 

Volcanoes produce massive amounts of CO2. They should be increasing temps according to the climate alarmists not lower temps.

Can you name any climate model that predicted increase in temps that is correct? The fact is that no model has matched actually observed temps.

Conservatives doubt climate change harmful claims because:

1. Climate science has become polluted by Leftist politics

2. Climate models have been totally wrong.

3. There is no such concept as scientific consensus in the study of any scientific field and claiming a consensus runs contrary to the scientific method.

4. The proposed solutions to climate change are to raise taxes, increase needless regulation, and empower elites. The solutions will be very very expensive and the results are not guaranteed or likely to reduce temps by any appreciable amount.   
 




 Can you tell us what the correct temp for planet earth should be?

Can you explain the 17 year pause in global warming?

Can you explain why the climate models predicting temp increases have not matched reality?

 Dear RedditPope, 

I apologize for my response to the other user. If you look at the comment thread between us, you can see that the other commenter was trolling me first. His trolling tactic (which is often used in Reddit political discussions) was to engage in an insincere political "debate". His goal was to ask for proof and citations for my positions. When I provided them he would ask for more, When I provided those, he would ask for still more. His goal was not to engage in a meaningful, honest political debate. His goal was to trick me into doing meaningless research and wasting my time so that he could mock me and my views. 

He was in fact the troll in this encounter. My response was simply calling him out on his trolling tactics. 

Thank you.   









 I knew you were a phoney and a chicken. I have played that game with Liberals so many times and you clones act the same way every time! I will let you in on a secret, I have a list of Obama links saved. I reel Liberals into my trap and then it gets sprung on them...every single time. Haha thanks again for the laugh

 Can we at least agree that Obama lied about Obamacare? His comments are on video. Can we at least agree on that?

 It's not. The EPA was established in the 70's and they did fine work then. Today the EPA is polluted by Leftist political goals of destroying American business, raising taxes, increasing needless regulations and empowering elites.

You state the typical Liberal fallacy that if one is opposed to any part of anything they are against everything. I am against the EPA abusing their power and destroying whole industries for the sake of their twisted ideology, Everyone is for clean water and air. 

Socialism stands for control. Control over the people by self declared elites who think the people are dumb and need to be led like children.

 Our current "president" does not act presidential. He is a terrible leader. He has terrible policies and is  narcissistic, ego maniacal,  and thin skinned.   




  I keep track of the number reddiors who make the exact same comment you just made. Congratulations for being the same as 197 other people. Now put on your helmet and get to school  




 Glad we share common ground on what is obvious to every educated thinker.  




 You must realize that Progresivism is not a general improvement of things, society, and the condition of the people. "Progressivism" and the policies of the Left are nothing but a rigid ideology based path towards socialism. Dissent is not allowed. Expressing contrary opinions is not allowed. Anyone who opposes the Left is evil in their eyes. The Left, AKA Progressives, Democrats, Liberals want to fundamentally change America from a Jeffersonian representative democracy into a socialist system where self appointed elites boss the common people around and compel them via intimidation and force to comply with their ideas of what a perfect society will look like.

The GOP (Grand Old Party) AKA Republicans is made up of various factions. 

1. Establishment Republicans (sometimes called RINOs- Republicans In Name Only)  are old school Republicans who favor big government, immigration amnesty, and are DC insiders.

2. Tea Party Conservatives are interested in smaller government, less taxes , and less regulation, They look to the founding fathers and the Constitution for guidance in making policy. The Left often demonize the Tea Party as being racist but no evidence whatsoever has ever been produced by the left to back that false claim up. The Tea Party just wants less government interference in the people's lives. Race has absolutely nothing to do with that.

3. Libertarians believe that the government should not be involved in anything except  a very few services. They favor no drug laws, no taxes, and they want the freedom to live their lives without government interference.

 The GOP is made up of several factions including the Tea Party and Establishment Republicans. Establishment Republicans support immigration reform aka the Dream Act etc. The Tea Party and other Conservatives support immigration reform only if the borders are secured first. Obama has refused to do this.

Tea Party Conservatives are against currently proposed immigration reforms because;

1. Obama refuses to close the borders.

2. Obama refuses to enforce current immigration laws.

3. Obama has unilaterally causes hundreds of thousands of new immigrants to illegally come here from Central America and Mexico.

4. Past promises of sealing the borders and enforcing current immigration laws have been ignored by the Democrats. Remember the immigration reform act passed by Reagan?

5. Obama and the Democrats want open borders and huge increases in illegal immigration so that any reform law would immediately allows millions of new voters to change the result of elections for decades. 

The race of Obama has nothing, nothing whatsoever to do with the GOP opposition to so called immigration reform.

Can you provide any proof that the GOP is in any way more racist than the Democrats or any other large group of Americans? 
























 I am curious, what is your level of education? Have you taken any history or poly sci classes? 




 Hahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahhahaahahahahahahaahahahhaahhaahahahhaahahhahahahahahahaahahhahaahahahahhaaahahahaahahhaahahahahahahahah 




  Conservatives oppose any Leftist, socialist, progressive, anti American policy by any politician.

Obama's policies tend to be Leftist, socialist, progressive, anti American thus we oppose his policies.

The fact that he is proposing them is irrelevant.  









  Asking for proof of such a switch is like asking for proof Rome existed, it's self-evident that it did.

Sorry but simply because you believe it does not make it true. Can you offer any policy statements, candidates' positions, voter outreach, advertising, or anything else to back up your claim that the GOP is racist or embraces racism as a policy. 

Please realize that simply because we Conservatives are opposed to the policies of Mr Obama that does not equate with being racist. We Conservatives oppose any Leftist policy regardless of the race, sex, religion of who proposes it. 

BTW the Nazis were socialists so your knowledge of politics seems to be a little suspect.   




 Again, Nixon offered an opinion 50 years ago that unhappy racist Democratic voters would shy away from the Democrat party and vote GOP. That's it. Nowhere does he say that the GOP should become racist, offer racist candidates, or racist policies. 

The migration of the Dixiecrat voters from the Democrats to the GOP occurred over a 40 year period. During that period it is safe to say that the percentage of any voters for whom racism is a deciding factor in who to vote for has fallen sharply. In fact that percentage of voters is probably insignificant at this point. 

No party would embrace racism because the rewards would be miniscule while the harm created would be vast.

The Left demonizes the Right with this false claim for one reason: to silence debate on the issues.  









 He was sharing an opinion almost 50 years ago. How does that quote equate to the GOP embracing racism as a policy? Nixon only said that as Southern racists get turned off by the Democrat party they will likely turn to the only other option which is the GOP. 

If that is all the proof you can offer then the only thing you have proven is that the Left is prejudiced against anyone who is different from them.  





























 Can you provide any proof of such a switch? All that happened was the Democrats rejected the overt racism that they had embraced in the past. There is no proof that the GOP then decided to embrace racism.  




 If I am so dumb then how come I provided an argument and you could not do so? 




 You should vote Tea Party then. 




 This whole switching sides meme is a false claim by the Left. I agree that the Democrats renounced overt racism that they supported up til the civil rights movement but nowhere has it been proven that the GOP, the party of Lincoln and Ike who sent federal troops in to desegregate Southern Democrat states switched and embraced racism as a party goal or platform. Logic proves this: voters who are overt racists make up a tiny percentage of the public. Voters who would be offended by racism make up a huge majority of voters. Why would any party embrace a tiny group for support at the expense of a huge support group? It makes no logical sense.  




 The Dixiecrats did start voting for the GOP gradually over 4 decades but how does that fact make the GOP racist? If a pedophile votes for Obama does that make our president a pedophile? Of course not.  




 Typical liberal. You can never respond with facts. I guess you do that because the facts don't back you up.  




 Can you provide proof that the Tea Party is racist? Do you realize that Democrats favored slavery, segregation, Jim Crow laws, and formed the KKK?  




 Yes because the spam service has copies of email that Clinton claims was deleted. This is important because Clinton put US security at risk, used unsecured server (which is against the law), and then lied about the whole affair.

Are you saying that honesty, following the law, respecting national security are not important qualities for a president to have?

 The stereotype that GOP members, voters, leaders, candidates are more racist than any other subset of society is false. That false claim can't be proven with facts. It is a false claim perpetuated by the Left in order to squelch debate on issues. If you can demonize your opponent as racists then many will not even take the time to even consider their arguments. If the KKK had the best education plan ever, no one would even consider it because who gives a shit what racists have to say on any subject? 




 Possibly, but in a tiny percentage no greater than exists in any other political party 




 That the Tea Party, GOP, Conservatives are in any way racist 







































 I am using the term socialism because the system you describe, even if you consider it distinct, seems like a version of socialism. 

The history of socialism is quite interesting. There have been many forms proposed. All retained the core elements of government (or community) control over the means of production and distribution, and a government (or community)  centric society at the expense  or individual liberty. Each form has had its own unique elements. 

Did you know that Naziism and Fascism were actually forms of socialism? Both retained the classical elements of socialism while Naziism added extreme racism and Fascism added extreme Nationalism respectively. 

You mentioned the Nordic model as a system you thought worthy of emulating. Albeit, that system works for those few countries at the present time, I do not see such a system working well in most countries. Such a system requires a stable, rich country of homogenous like minded people, in a very stable period in its history.

Do you think such a system would work in poor countries such as current day Guatemala,  or Sudan? What about countries in the Middle East with strong religious fervor?  What about those same Nordic countries during WWII?

I agree with you that the rich have an inordinate and unfair amount  of influence over the rest of the people. Rousseau complained of this as did Marx and many others since. I am not convinced that without oppressive and violent coercion by  government that such  power can be controlled. A revolution might stop such power abuses temporarily but historically a new clique of elites always arises, becomes wealthy, and then goes on to abuse the poor and powerless. 

The history of governance has always been about royalty, warlords,  powerful elites oppressing the powerless and the poor. I fear such a condition is hard wired into human beings.

The only system ever developed that has understood this human reality and instituted steps to combat it is the US Constitutional based Jeffersonian republic model.

That system understood that man, left to himself would always revert to a system of elites imposing their will on the poor and powerless. That system created a series of checks and balances to control abuse of power. That system is slow and cumbersome but it does work. The three branches of government, frequent elections, a hard to amend Constitution, and a right of the people to keep and bear arms all assure that a truly abusive or controlling government can't ever succeed for long. 

In the end, no government is perfect in controlling human nature. 
Any form of government, including the one proposed by you, must grasp that.


 




 The Nordic model seems to work because the population is homogenous and the countries' military security is heavily secured by the USA. It concerns me that such a government model is not sustainable economically if the US stopped supporting them militarily and the population changes and the welfare states become overburdened by immigrants from the Middle East. 

I also fear that such socialist style governments have had an historically horrendous track record as it pertains to human rights and violence against their own people.   












































 So do you support a socialist political solution? Is there any government past or present that comes close to your government preference? I am trying to understand your views. Thanks 




 Always try to clear away your defective chute first or else your reserve chute is likely to get tangled up in defective chute and then splat.. 




 So what government system or party do you recommend? 




 I agree with much of what you say. Much of the campaign will not involve debate of the issues and proposed solutions by the candidates. Instead the debate will consist of the Left claiming the Right is evil and racist. Each side will talk in platitudes such as "defend the middle class". 

The only political entity that speaks of political change and means it is the Tea Party elements of the GOP. The Tea Party opposes not only the big government, big spending Democrats but also the establishment, old boy, DC insider wing of the GOP. 

The Tea Party stands for lower taxes, smaller government, and less regulation. In essence it stands for greater personal freedom of the people.

 I mean Leftist, Progressive, Liberal, and Socialist.  




 Conservatives are against any political leader who holds Leftist positions regardless of race, sex, or any other factor. If Hillary is elected then we will oppose her. If Bernie Sanders is elected then we will oppose him.

The NYT shames itself by suggesting some racial motivation. I challenge anyone to offer proof that the GOP is racist, supports racist policies, or offers racist candidates.
 




  "Romney made real conservatives stay at home and that's why he lost" to be incorrect. 

and am ignoring those that simply don't or won't vote at all. 

I believe you are missing the fact of the current schism within the GOP between establishment, RINO, DC insiders, and capital "C" Conservatives, Tea Party members, and Libertarians.

While the former group voted for McCain and Romney respectively, the later group stayed away from the polls. The latter group will not support any more milquetoast fax Republican candidates. If a true Conservative becomes the nominee then the latter group will support that candidate in force,

In the end a true Conservative candidate will have the vast support of the GOP, and with that the support of a significant portion of the Independent vote, will outnumber the 33% of the voting public that identifies with the Democrat Party. 

Just as Obama energized the Left, so too will a Conservative candidate energize the Right.

 I do not dispute the claim that the climate changes.

I am concerned that all climate change models have been wrong. That fact alone proves that climate change modelling is imprecise and thus our understanding of climate systems is not well understood. 

I am not convinced that rising CO2 levels is bad for the planet. Historically, CO2 levels have been much higher.

I am concerned that Leftist politics has tainted scientific examination of the climate.

I am concerned that grants and professional scientific advancement are dictated by those with a vested interest in claims of anthropogenic climate change.

I am concerned that those who are pushing climate change are opposed to the scientific method and continued study of the climate.

I am concerned that data on climate change has to be modified for various reasons.

I am concerned that the proposed solutions to climate change involve raising taxes, increasing regulation, and empowering elites.

I am concerned that those solutions will be very expensive and results are not guaranteed and at best would result in almost non existent improvements.

The bottom line is that this is an issue that should be determined entirely by scientists, who can offer reproducible results.

Concepts such as consensus, politics, gaia religious fervor, environmentalism, leftist ideology etc have no place in this issue.

Do you agree or not agree that this issue should be determined by scientists employing the scientific method and that non scientific input should not be considered? 




 There is no such thing as a scientific consensus. There is only the scientific method. Are you opposed to the scientific method? 

Can you explain why NASA climate models have all been been wrong? 




 Just. Provide. Proof. That. The. GOP. Is. Racist 




 Can you explain the 18 year pause in warming?

Can you say what the normal earth temp should be?

Can you say what the normal level of CO2 should be?

Can you explain why every climate model has been so terribly wrong?

 




 Actually it does. My world is entirely based on reality. If you disagree with me then you should use facts, logic, history, and debate me on why I am wrong. If you prove your point then I will concede that point to you. If you are wrong (as your claim that the GOP is racist) then you should be man enough to accept that you are wrong. 

 




 Please refer to my previous comment below. I realize you wish Hitler was not a socialist but he was. Did you know that the acronym "NAZI" stands for National Socialist German Worker's Party?

 Hitler and Mussolini were life long socialist writers and supporters. Both philosophized newer, better forms of socialism that they believed kept the core beliefs of socialism (such as government control over the means of production and distribution and a community based society at the expense of individual liberty) while introducing more effective measures.
 
 
 
 They formed their own versions of socialism (Hitler created socialism with elements of extreme racism and Mussolini created a nationalistic version of socialism.
 
 
 
 If you ever read Marx, you would know that he viewed socialism as a point in a political continuum in which societies began as agrarian, moved into capitalism/industrialism, then evolved into socialism (which included "cooperating" and controlling some capitalist industries in the interest of expediency) and finally moving on to Communism.
 
 
 
 The fact that Hitler and Mussolini used industries does not mean they supported capitalism. It means they were in keeping with socialistic doctrine of controlling (not just owning) the means of production.
 
 
 
 As for your claim that Hitler killed all socialist and communists is partially true. Hitler, as a socialist (Naziism) favored his version of socialism and oppressed all other competing forms of socialism such as the communists. Hitler did not like communists because he thought they were too internationally focused, too theoretical, and contained too many Jews as members.

 




 I bet you are also an MMA cage fighter, Special Forces trainer (possibly a Navy SEAL) and all the ladies love you. 

No, it is obvious you are uneducated past a high school level and you are incurious of the world around you and are simply a follower. I am not criticizing you, I know I appreciate people like you when my car needs to be waxed or I need someone to serve tasty snacks at parties. 

The bottom line is that I CHALLENGED YOU to provide proof and you simply could not do so. You failed plain and simple.

You proved that I was smarter than you and I appreciate the compliment.  




 Your comment shows that you are not simply uneducated but you are also uncreative. I see a bright future for you working with the public and serving them French Fries. Hahahaha 




 At least 150 other redditors have made that exact same comment before you.

 I know you feel the need to joke about this but please consider that I made a simple request for you to provide proof of YOUR claims and you simply could not do so.

I challenged your belief system and you failed to prove that it is based on fact and not faith.

I place you in the same category a some snake handling Pentecostal baptist minister in the hills of Arkansas preaching about Jesus. If I asked him for proof of his beliefs he would act just as you did and respond just as you did.

You and he are the same.

  




  To say the current GOP politicians are not racist is to ignore overwhelming evidence to the contrary.

Such as?

Why can't you simply provide any?

 Dude, all I am asking you to do is find me proof that the GOP is racist! Why can't you do a simple google search and find me a link that contains facts (not opinions) that the GOP is racist?

The obvious answer is that you can't. Please don't get mad at me because you are uneducated. Take this moment as a suggestion to get educated. Life will go a lot better for you if you lead an educated, factual life and not be lead by religions, sorcery, magical thinking, and willful ignorance. 

Facts not faith

If you are in high school, graduate. If you are out of high school get your GED. If you have graduated from high school then try Community College.

 Hitler, Pol Pot, and Mussolini were all socialists. Are you denying that?!! 




 You are obviously a racist. /s 




 Interesting how your desired form of government, socialism, has been responsible for the deaths of over 100 million people over the past century. How did the policies of Mao, Stalin, Hitler, Pol Pot, Mussolini, and even Maduro "benefit average people"? 










































































 We agree that cops are too quick to resort to deadly force.

Can you offer any facts to prove that the GOP is racist, supports racist policies, offers racist candidates? This is a serious question. It is often claimed that they are racists but there is never any proof. I am asking you to simply do a google search and provide me with proof that the GOP is any more racist than any other group in the US.

The Democrats have a long history of overt racism in America: supporting slavery and fighting a war to protect it, Jim Crow laws, creating the KKK, segregation, etc.

Republicans were against slavery (remember Abe Lincoln?), fought a war to end slavery, Ike sent in federal troops to desegregate Southern schools because Democrat governors vehemently opposed integration.

Let's see if YOU can provide proof that the GOP is racist. This should be easy if what you claim is true.

Note: Please do not provide self supporting opinion articles from far Left web sites. 

Thank you 




 I think you are confused. I am saying that the GOP isn't racist and the media claim that the GOP somehow condones or defends this cop's actions is false. 

I personally think that cops in this country are too quick to resort to deadly force and shoot people.

 Can you provide proof of GOP racism? If it is so pervasive then it should be easy to do....crickets 




 But did you graduate from high school? 




 GOP accepts the fact that the climate changes. We do not accept the claim that man is the major cause of climate change nor do we automatically accept the claim that rising CO2 levels is bad for the climate. We believe that the science of climate is not understood to the point that we can simply say "the science is settled". We should continue to experiment and study.

We are further suspicious of the field of climate science being co-opted by Leftist political motives. The issue of climate change should be determined by science and not ulterior financial or political motives.  

I disagree that the science is separate from the proposed solutions. The two are inextricably linked and the solutions of raising taxes, expanding regulation, and empowering elites is the motivation for politicizing the science.  




 Can you provide proof of GOP racism? If it is so pervasive then it should be easy to do....crickets 




 GOP does not deny science. The GOP is resistant to accept issues such as man made climate change in which the science has become overly politicized with Leftist ideology. The Left's solution to climate change is the same solution they always propose: raise taxes and empower elites.  




 Why is that? Can you provide any proof that the GOP is racist or supports such killings? Do you even have a GED?

 Voter turnout for past 10 election cycles is around 53%

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout_in_the_United_States_presidential_elections

The link below shows party identity figures:

http://www.gallup.com/poll/15370/party-affiliation.aspx


Simple math proves my point.

47% of the voting public do not usually vote.

Of that group, approximately a third identify as either Democrat, Republican, or Independent respectively. 

Assume the entire 33% of Democrats vote for the same candidate. 

According to you,  that fact alone would decide an election regardless of how the Republicans or Independents voted.

Result? Your claim is foolish on its face.

 









 How do your figures in any way show how many people, of either party did not vote in any election? 

Your comment that "The Dems decide if the GOP wins by turning out or not. " is ridiculous on its face. 

Given how closely national elections have been decided, If either party had unusually heavy turnout they would win any given election. 

If Ted Cruz or Scott Walker (or any other candidate that was acceptable to Conservatives was the nominee) then not only would the regular GOP voters vote for him but also the voting block that has stayed home for the past few elections would vote as well. 

The result would be a GOP landslide win.  









 Conservatives are simply refusing to vote for RINOs anymore. This has been brewing for several elections and will continue to get worse. There is a real divide  within the GOP. Many Conservatives are calling for a third party or a real clensing of RINO elements from the party.  

The Dems decide if the GOP wins by turning out or not. 

You wish 


































 Scott Walker and Ted Cruz are favorites now. There is very little stomach for establishment or moderate  RINO candidates within the GOP. Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, even Marco Rubio have very limited support. 

In the last election, huge numbers of GOP voters stayed home in protest over Mitt Romney because he was perceived to be just another big government DC insider.  




 Scott Walker and Ted Cruz are favorites now. There is very little stomach for establishment or moderate  RINO candidates within the GOP. Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, even Marco Rubio have very limited support.  




 As a Conservative I can say that the popularity of Jeb Bush within the GOP is misleading. He has no support from Conservatives and only has the support of establishment GOP DC insiders. As other GOP candidates enter the race he will fade into single digit support. He has zero chance of becoming the GOP nominee and thus zero chance of becoming president.

 "ISIS" 














 Obviously all Liberals don't think that way but the vast majority of Liberal intelligentsia, leadership, policy makers, philosophers, feel that way. 

Leftist ideology requires that a cadre of elites formulates policy and the common members follow without question.   




 Don't feel bad (seriously). All Leftists quickly bow out of any in depth debates. I honestly don't know why that is but I assume it's because Leftism and all of it's strains are ideological and not based on hard facts and careful analysis. Leftism is noble in it's proclaimed aims of elevating the common man and alleviating suffering but in practice those goals never seem to  get achieved. Rather, the Left seems to always get into trouble when anyone challenges their policies and coercion and violence are required to enforce compliance. 

The woman in that picture was not risking her life to escape communism, the woman was escaping socialism, totalitarianism, any ism you want to call it but she was trying to escape having others impose their will upon her and coerce her into obedience. 

Best of luck. Peace 




 The woman, and thousands of others escaped or tried to escape from East Germany during the cold war. They tried to escape a socialist government that built a wall and under penalty of death tried to keep people in. Why did East Germany do this? Why did the other socialist Warsaw Pact countries do the same thing? Why does Cuba do so today? Why does North Korea do so today?

Socialism has been responsible for the deaths of over 100 million people over the past century. The Soviets, the Maoist Chinese, Castro's Cuba, Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge (the killing fields), Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, etc to name the most egregious examples.

How can you possibly condone the actions of those socialist regimes? 

ALL Communists are socialist. 

Why do you feel the need to insult me? If you had a strong argument you would not need to do so. 

PS over 100 redditors have made the exact same comment you made about my user name. Not very creative of you to do the same 




 That isn't a part of liberal ideology

Not so. Liberal ideology dictates that only poor people choose military service because they have no other alternative. Once in the military, those people are tasked with killing, raping, and oppressing brown people, usually for oil or resources, and as a result, become psychologically damaged and sociopaths. 




 A small "L" liberal is interested in power vesting in the people and not the government

A capital "L" Liberal  is a socialist who follows a strict Leftist ideology 




 That was pretty rude of that fireworks display to just barge in there like that.  




 So why was the woman risking her life to escape East Germany? 




 Those redditors who support socialism should consider why this woman risked her life to escape from East Germany to West Germany....

 My original comment was that Liberals lie about everything. I contend that the entire Liberal point of view is based not on logical, factual debate versus Conservative's logical, factual points but on the fact that Liberals must necessarily lie to disguise their faulty arguments. In other words, Liberals can't win debates based on facts so they have to resort to lies.

The five points you offer above prove this. You rely not on any real or actual Conservative view points but instead rely on the false narrative that Liberals claim Conservatives hold. AKA you rely on lies and not on actual Conservative views. 

In reality, Conservatives have factual, logical, philosophicaly based reasons why they hold the views they have. 

As a Tea Party Conservative, I am not a racist. I get my news from many sources and not from any Fox News echo chamber. I oppose socialism, Leftism, Progressivism philosophically because they are the antithesis of Jeffersonian Democracy. I have no business overlords and I am an atheist.  I oppose Obama, Bernie Sanders, Hillary, Liz Warren and every other Leftist based on their views and policies. I have scientific reasons why I doubt that anthropogenic climate change is a serious issue or that the proposed solutions would offer any difference.

I don't believe that you are consciously lying. I believe that you and other Liberals are being fed lies by the media, academia, entertainment, and fellow Liberals who then form opinions based on false information.

I believe Liberals lie so that any debate on the facts never takes place. Conservatives are demonized as haters so that their views never have to even be considered.   

  




 Can you tell me why Conservatives oppose the issues above? I am curious if you actually believe that Conservatives have rational, logical, well thought out and sincere reasons why they hold the positions they have on political issues.

Oh and all of the issues above ARE political issues to Conservatives.

Well? 




 Liberals incorrectly claim that Conservatives:

1. Oppose Obamacare because they are racist

2. Oppose climate change because they are anti science

3. Oppose any female candidate because they are anti women

4. Oppose gay marriage because of homophobia

5. Oppose immigration reform due to being xenophobic 




 Seriously, can you tell me one issue where Liberals accurately  portray Conservatives views?

 Of course. Atwater stated that the GOP was trying to attract disaffected southern Democrat voters be focusing on economic issues rather than appeals to racism. That was a Reagan adviser 40 years ago.

Many uneducated people misunderstand the Southern Strategy or do so intentionally for political gain. 

 How do his comments on the Southern strategy prove the false claim that the GOP is racist?  




 The Democrats were overt racists and supported slavery, segregation, Jim Crow, created the Klan, and opposed civil rights for blacks.

The GOP was the party of Lincoln and supported the end of slavery, integration, and civil rights .

These are indisputable facts.

Democrats renounced overt racism during the civil rights movement and should be commended for that.

There exists no proof whatsoever that the GOP changed course and embraced racism, fielded racist candidates, or supported racist policies.

The Left has pushed this lie for political reasons  to squelch debate on the merits of the issues and to influence uneducated or disinterested voters.

  Actually, Marx said socialism is the political stage before Communism. In socialism the government controls the means of production and distribution. The word control does not just mean outright ownership. Control can mean the government allows  private ownership of business or industries but that it controls how ownership makes decisions, production, access to raw materials, distribution channels etc etc etc

 The Fascists were socialists. Mussolini was a devout socialist leader and writer. He envisioned a type of socialism that featured extreme nationalism. This is common basic history.

 Professor said the Nazis were right wing. Actually the Nazis were socialists (edit note: it amazes me how many uneducated people are down voting this comment.  Yes, I know you were told the Nazis were right wing but that refers to the socialist political spectrum not the entire political spectrum) 














 Naziism was a socialist political movement. The Nazis, AKA the National Socialist German Workers Party, believed in government control over the means of production and distribution and a government centric society at the expense of individual liberty. Hitler was a devout socialist leader and writer. He felt that standard socialism was too slow and he  felt Naziism offered a better socialist path. He disliked communists because he felt they were too internationally focused and that they contained too many Jewish members. 

Hitler was a true socialist as was Mussolini. They were certainly not Communists. Socialism works on paper but always fails in real life. The reason? Because ultimately, the government (acting in proxy for the community) must use force to compel the people to comply. It is at that point that all socialist societies resort to violence to force the people to obey. 

The US has killed many during its history and yes some of those people have been innocents. But you simply can't compare what the US has done in its history with what socialist regimes have done in their histories. The US have killed mostly combatants that were actively trying to kill Americans. Did Pol Pot do the same? Mao? Hitler? Stalin? Tito? Ceauescu?  No, the difference is that those regimes used violence to compel civilians to obey. They used murder, starvation, secret police, active campaigns to force compliance to official policy. 

 









 It shouldn't be but sadly it is. Whenever an issue becomes politicized, facts become scarce 














 What about the socialist regimes that have led to 100 million deaths? Remember Pol Pot, the Soviets, Cubans, China, Nazis, Fascists? What about them?

What will happen to those countries once immigrants from the middle east overwhelm their social safety nets?

 Marx said that socialism required government control over the means of production. That may or may not mean outright ownership of a company or industry by the government. It can also mean the fovernment allows a company or industry to remain in private hands but falls under srtict governments control. 
With regard to the Nazis, the government allowed many armament  companies to remain in private hands but it kept strict control over the companies' decision making on out puts, pricing, and access to raw materials. Examples include Krupps, volkswagen, Mercedes Benz, focker, mauser etc etc etc 




 Yawn. Considering your lack of education, maybe you should stick to commenting on r/videogames. I am so tired of uneducated high school teens debating factual issues with their simplistic opinions. Facts are facts. No  matter how much they conflict with your juvenile worldview they still stubbornly exist.   




 I suggest you request a refund from the "college" you attended. Personally, I doubt you even graduated from high school. Telling me to fuck off, that's great. Did you learn that debating strategy from the debating team at the "college" you attended?  




 I am curious, what level of education have you achieved? I ask because discussing the subject of socialism with you is like discussing the subject of religion with a Pentecostal bible thumper. You have a set, faith based view of the world. Facts, logic, and history are meaningless to you. I suggest you open a book or do your own research to learn basic historical facts that anyone who has taken a 200 level college political science class would readily know. Good luck 




 

At the turn of the 20th century in Germany, many political philosophers took the core elements of socialism and added their own elements to it in an attempt to improve on the basic socialist model. Hitler did not like Communism because it was internationally focused and had too many Jews as members. Hence he developed his brand of socialism called National Socialism. Others created their own brands of socialism. These improved systems still retained their classical socialist elements. 

It was Marx who said that political systems were on a continuum with societies starting as agrarian, then capitalist, then socialist, and finally communist. That was Marx who said that. He stated that during the transitional phase known as socialism, government would control the means of production. That may mean ownership or it may mean coercion or legislative control over formerly private industries. Ever hear of Obamacare? The government does not own the industry but it controls it. 

Your opinions on what socialism means to you is interesting but they are not the definitions that Marx or any other socialist agrees with. I simply don't know why you are having so much trouble understanding what socialism is. I highly suggest that rather than simply guessing, you should actually study the history of socialism.

I simply don't know why you are having so much trouble understanding what socialism is. I highly suggest that rather than simply guessing, you should actually study the history of socialism.    




 The nazis were socialists because they were the National Socialist German Workers Party.  Their core beliefs were a government centeic society at the expence of personal liberty. They practiced in governmemt  comtrol over the means of production and distribution. Hitler was a long time socialist writer and philosopher  who envisioned Naziism as a fairer and faster form of socialism.  




 Naziism was a form of socialism. I can't  debate such an obvious historical fact. Please brush up on the subject so you can debate  intelligently in the future. Btw what level of educarion have you  achieved? Just curious 




 Marx said in communism, ownership of the means of production by the community is necessary but in socialism, the step before communism, control over the means of production is allowed and even useful  as a neccesarry transitional state. I really wish you had a greater basic knowledge of Marx and his theories. It also puzzles me how you assume your views are infallable . You are simple wrong here. Don't take it personally. The facts are the facts 




 The nazis were socialists. We really cant debate that point. You really need to study the socialist movents in Germany during the early 20th century. It is facinating how ao many tried to take the core elements of socialism and try to improve on them to make socialism better, faster, and fairer.  Naziism and Fascism were two such attempts.  




 Care to refute my facts?  Or are you only interested in silly snark?  




 Sorry but you need take some college level poly sci courses.  If you have already done so demand a refund. The Nazis and the Fascists were both socialist movements. Socialism requires  control over the means of production and distribution.  That does not equal ownership of industries, merely control. I suggest  you study the socialist movements of the early 20th century. It is a facinating field that explains how many took the core elements of socialism and tried to create a better, faster, fairer socialist system. The nazis and fascists were two such improved socialist systems. Rather than just claiming these facts are not so, why not put that effort into actually learning  about socialism. Good luck
  




 The nazis were socialists as were the  Italian  fascists. Have you ever taken a college level political science  class?  




 Hitler was a devout socialist.  Naziism was a form of socialism. You are confusing the fact that the soviets considered  them right wing. They were on the right side of the socialist political spectrum but they are on the far left of the whole political spectrum. Socialism is classified as a government  or community  centric political system that controls the means of production and distribution. That defines the nazis. Naziism took socialism and added antisemitetism to it.  




 Why is that? Are you pro Nazi and pro socialist? 




 I was making the point that it is a good thing when Naziism, which is a form of socialism fails. Naziism is a bad system. Do you disagree with that?  




 funny!

 zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz boring 




 Blah blah blah. You are simply parroting things you have heard and don't understand.  




 I asked you a scientific question  and you can't  answer it. No matter how you avoid it that is proof you know nothing about acience.  Maybe stick to subreddits like r/spongebob? 




 That cloud looks just like a mountain! 




  The main problem is the rate of the change. In the past, nature has always been able to adapt to natural changes slowly over time. 

Earth's temperatures vary widely by season. In the space a a few months, temps can go from 100F in summer to -50 below zero in the same location. The rate of temps rising in the last century is well within the normal fluctuations observed throughout earth's history. Earth's temps are cyclical and complex. Solar activity, volcanic activity, ocean activity all impact earth's climate. What make you think that the proposed solutions, raising taxes and empowering elites, will have any impact on the climate at all?  




 You are obviously not a person versed in science. Maybe you shouldn't discuss climate change?  




 
There are no correct or normal variables for these questions, there are only correct parameters within which mankind can remain prosperous

Can you say what those parameters are? I ask because a .7 degree rise in temps over the past century is hardly a reason for concern or to spend billions needlessly. 


 




 I accept your admission of defeat. Either you can answer my questions with actual science or you can't. You can't. Good luck at Ringling Bros 




 I am still waiting for you to answer my questions. Until you do, then get a job at a carnival. 

Any clown can make silly claims. 




 You lost a debate on climate change because I had the science to prove my case. Now all you have is snark. In the end, I would rather Be the scientist than the silly jester.   




 I used science and you used religion and I defeated you. Science....deal with it... 




 You were beaten by a smarter, better person today. Nothing to be ashamed of. I'm sure your religion is important to you. 




 I hope you realize that a climate change skeptic debated you today and kicked your butt. Victory is indeed sweet! 


































 Yup, I thought so. You can't answer the question. That means your position is not science. Your position is political, philosophical, or religious. Praise Gaia! 




 If you can't establish what temperatures and CO2 levels are needed to save the planet then your argument is non scientific. Think about it.... 




 Lets stick to facts:

If climate change is indeed a scientifically based problem, then you must be able to establish a factual baseline for which all measurements of possible damage and solutions can be based.

What are the correct and normal atmospheric temperature(s) for Earth?

What are the correct and normal ocean temperature(s) for Earth?

What is the correct and normal CO2 level for Earth?

If you (or anyone else) cannot answer these questions then the issue of the dangers of climate change is not scientifically based and therefor is either politically, philosophically, or religiously based 




  but temps are still rising at a rate of 0.05C/yr.

That figure is well within the margin of error. Translation: not a reliable or provable fact.

Lets stick to facts:

If climate change is indeed a scientifically based problem, then you must be able to establish a factual baseline for which all measurements of possible damage and solutions  can be based.

 Rather than merely claiming my sources are compromised, can you point out which of their claims are factually incorrect? Has there or has there not been an 18 year pause in rising temps? Have all climate change models predicting fast rises of temps been wrong or correct? Have temp reading been enhanced rather than simply reported? Have climate change proponents emails admitted lies, changed data, and an organized campaign of retribution against anyone who opposed them?

Can you deny that Leftist politics has seriously influenced climate science?

Can you deny that major climate change proponents have lied, changed data, are influenced by politics, or are influenced by grant money? 





























 The 97% of scientists agree that anthropogenic climate change is occurring claim has been thoroughly debunked.

http://www.thegwpf.org/new-paper-the-97-consensus-and-its-critics/

http://www.thegwpf.org/content/uploads/2014/09/Warming-consensus-and-it-critics1.pdf

The 97% claim is based on a study by John Cook. His emails on the study are revealing:

"Its essential that the public understands that theres a scientific consensus on AGW. So [Skeptical Science activists] Jim Powell, Dana [Nucitelli] and I have been working on something over the last few months that we hope will have a game changing impact on the public perception of consensus. Basically, we hope to establish that not only is there a consensus, there is a strengthening consensus." -John Cook

Two things are immediately apparent from this email: Cook had decided even before he began his investigations what those investigations would reveal.    This was always going to be a PR exercise, not a scientific one.
    

Cook's own emails further destroy any credibility in the 97% figure be showing his intentionally misleading methodology:

"Okay, so weve ruled out a definition of AGW being any amount of human influence or more than 50 percent human influence. Were basically going with Aris porno approach (I probably should stop calling it that) which is AGW = humans are causing global warming. e.g.  no specific quantification which is the only way we can do it considering the breadth of papers were surveying." -John Cook

But Cooks 97 percent consensus claim was rebutted in subsequent analyses of his study. A paper by five leading climatologists published in the journal Science and Education last year found that Cooks study misrepresented the views of most consensus scientists.

The definition Cook used to get his consensus was weak, the climatologists said. Only 41 out of the 11,944 published climate studies examined by Cook explicitly stated that mankind caused most of the warming since 1950 meaning the actual consensus is 0.3 percent.  




 The climate systems, ocean systems, solar activity, and all other factors that effect Earth's climate are very complex. 

The fact that all models predicting temperature rises have been woefully wrong compared to actual data proves this.

This graph proves there has indeed been a pause in global temperatures for 18 years and running:

The data for the graph above is from RSS satellite.

You said:

There is no ideal temperature for Earth

there is no constant to provide as an answer, CO2 levels are always changing

So how do we know that the current (or future)  temp and CO2 levels are bad? Doesn't that defeat your entire premise?



 




 Let me see your cites professor 




 So you agree then that there is no scientific significance to the term consensus. Our understanding of any scientific field of study, at any given time,   is but a point on a moving continuum. We should never simply conclude that we know enough and quit a scientific field.  




 First of all, that 97% of scientists figure has been thoroughly debunked. That survey was made of a hundred odd scientists, the vast majority of which were not climatologists. 

If we understand the climate systems involved as you claim, can you explain:

The 18 year pause in temperature increase? 

Why every climate model has been incorrect?

What the best temperature for Earth should be?

What the best CO2 level for Earth should be?

 




 There is no such determination. Ever hear of the Scientific Method?  




 The climate always changes. The question is whether man is contributing to an increase in temperatures that is disastrously harmful.  









 It's a fake issue designed to increase taxes and empower elites.

 Can you offer any proof of your claims?  




 Businesses expand when:

1. Demand increases

2. Have extra capital to diversify and enter new market with new goods or services.

3. Have extra capital to increase market share of existing market place (even if that market is in decline).

Money does not sit still. Extra profits are invested by the business itself or it is banked and the bank lends out capital to other businesses.  




 Have you ever owned a business? Most businesses set a percentage mark-up to sell a good or service over cost. If that mark-up is 40% then if your costs go up you raise prices to maintain that 40% mark-up. If all McDonald's and other fast food restaurants have to pay their employees nearly twice what they are being paid currently then they must raise retail prices to maintain their 40% profit margin.  Businesses will then turn to technology to perform jobs currently done by human workers. 

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/11/fast-food-robot_n_5668600.html 




 Businesses try to expand and  increase market share even when demand is constant. Take casinos for example. Almost every state is trying to open casinos. Is that in response to an increase in gamblers? No, it's an attempt to capture market share locally rather than allow gamblers to travel to states with existing casinos.  




 A higher minimum wage merely raises costs for businesses who in turn will utilize cheaper technology solutions. Businesses will also raise prices for their goods and services which will raise the prices for all products and services. What happens 2 years from now when the minimum wage is 15 per hour and a gallon of milk costs $10? Prices will catch up to wages and minimum wage workers will have the same buying power they have today. 





























 not every dollar spent on or by given entities have the same economic utility. 

Businesses that create jobs have a greater economic utility than giving away money through public spending. One creates JOBS while the latter simply gives away money that is dependent on  continued handouts 




 Demand can be created by giving the poor money via government spending or it can be created by making the cost of doing business less via less taxation and less regulation which allows business to expand and hire more workers, who will then spend more.


It all comes down to who one philosophically wants to give money to to stimulate the economy: business or poor people. I favor giving it to business because they will create jobs that will remain after the stimulus has ended. Giving money to the poor via public spending ends once the stimulus money is stopped. It's the old give a man a fish and he eats for a day, teach him how to fish and he eats forever scenario. Plus, in the real world, stimulus through government spending too often gives money not to the poor but to politically connected unions.   




 What I am saying, in the simplest way possible, is that both rely on an induced stimulus effect, either given to business or public spending. Liberals always claim stimulating the economy through tax cuts  is terrible but then they wish to stimulated the economy with public spending. This is nothing but a chicken and egg argument.  




 Sadly, yes... GHW Bush is a RINO. Republican In Name Only 




 I don't understand your point.... 




 You forget one key element: Giving money to the poor to stimulate economic growth last only as long as the poor are receiving money. When the spigot stops so does the increased demand. 

 




 You miss the whole reason businesses exist: to make money and expand if demand and the markets support expansion. If demand is increases then business will expand to meet that demand. If a business has extra money then it usually will expand to increase existing market share or venture into new business lines and products and services. Basic econ stuff here... 




 Reagan and JFK proved that Supply Side economics works. Romney is a RINO and a progressive 









 Sorry but you need to learn basic economics. If the poor are given money then they will spend and it will stimulate the economy. When business is given money via tax breaks that money gets invested in new business ventures or expansion. Money in tax havens protects that money from taxes. That money does not just sit there. It gets invested in new businesses or expand existing ventures. 

Have you ever taken an econ 101 class? 














 Sorry but there is no economic theory called trickle down economics. The Left uses the term as a pejorative and derogatory term for the economic theory known as Supply Side economics. The Left also uses the terms Voodoo economics and Reaganomics as similar derogatory terms. 

This is basic econ 101 stuff... 




 "Supply side" economics= lowering tax rates and lessening regulations to give business more money to expand and hire new workers.

Liberal Keynesian economics=using tax dollars for public works and public spending in order to give people more money that will increase demand and lead business to expand and hire more workers.

See? They are the same type of stimulus programs except for who gets the big stimulating chunk of money.

If one doesn't work then the other must necessarily not work either. This is simple econ 101 stuff here....   
 




 First off, there is no such economic theory called trickle down.

Second, if top down stimulus based economics is false then the Liberal government stimulus theory must also be wrong.

 You obviously are not educated. I realize that you were told in high school that the Nazis were "right wing" but what you failed to learn back then was that the soviets called the Nazis right wing because they were to the right of them politically on the socialist spectrum. 

Naziism was a combination of socialism and nationalism. Hitler was a devout socialist writer and political theorist. If you had ever taken a college level poli sci class you would have known that.  

The Nazis followed the socialist belief in government control over the means of production. Control does not necessarily mean ownership. It simply means control over privately owned industry. Again, if you had ever been to college you would know that....

  




 And why is that? The Nazis were socialists. Don't blame me because you are uneducated

 You are missing the point. The fact that the Nazis were against the Marxists or Communists does not prove they were not socialists. The nazis were against the Communists because they viewed them as political rivals (and Hitler thought the Communists had too many Jewish members).

The Nazis' socialist roots are a historical fact. Rather than continue this fruitless exchange may I offer a suggestion? The study of socialism is a fascinating pursuit. At the turn of the 20th century, many political philosophers, especially in Germany, sought out to find the perfect socialist system. Many variations of socialism were envisioned. These variations maintained the core elements of classical socialism such as government (community) control over the means of production and distribution and a government (community) centric society at the expense of personal liberty.  Do you remember the movie Monte Python and the Holy Grail? That movie featured peasants that organized themselves as "Anarcho-syndicalists". That group was another of these socialist movements that tried to create a better form of socialism.  Naziism was another such improved socialist system.

Rather than argue, please simply study this extremely interesting period in political history and learn how others tried to add to and improve socialist theory.  




 After another 30 second google search:

Nazis were socialists:

http://jonjayray.tripod.com/hitler.html

Socialism allows for private ownership of industry during transitional phase:

http://www.stephenhicks.org/2009/12/04/economic-socialism-not-capitalism-section-8-of-nietzsche-and-the-nazis/

 














 You are straying from our discussion. Returning to our discussion, the Nazis were indeed socialists and their form of socialism, as is the case with other socialist systems, there exists a period before community ownership over the means of production that  allows for private ownership of industry. This refutes your claim that the Nazis were not socialist because they allowed for some industries to remain in private hands. 





























 
" the work is planned, financed and managed by the state; the directors of industry are appointed by the state and profits are considered the income of the state. Second, we find that a condition is defined as state capitalism (or state socialism) under which capitalist enterprises are controlled by the state. This definition is misleading, however, as there still exists under these conditions capitalism in the form of private ownership, although the owner of an enterprise is no longer the sole master, his power being restricted so long as some sort of social insurance system for the workers is accepted."

 It is truly sad that your worldview is so rigid that even when faced with historical proof, you simply can't evolve and assume dishonestly that I must be trolling you. That type of magical thinking is what children do to avoid reality. 

If you are indeed a serious adult then you really owe it to yourself to learn about the real world and not the world you create in your own mind. It is a historical fact that the Naziism and Fascism were types of socialism. People sometimes get confused because the Soviets considered them as their mortal enemies and it is assumed that that meant they were opposites politically. It is often stated that the Nazis were right wing but such claims are based on a comparison  on the socialist political spectrum. In other words, the Soviets considered the Nazis as right wing to themselves.  If the Nazis were placed on a political spectrum that included all major political systems then the Nazis fall squarely far left of center in the socialist systems.

Please simply study the various socialist systems created during the turn of the 20th century. Or you can simply pretend that your worldview is complete and accurate and live in a fantasy world. Good luck  




 I found this simple explanation after a 30 second google search:

Intermediate phases

The period in which capitalism becomes increasingly insufficient as an economic system and immediately after the proletarian conquest of the state, an economic system that features elements of both socialism and capitalism will probably exist until both the productive forces of the economy and the cultural and social attitudes develop to a point where they satisfy the requirements for a full socialist society (one that has lost the need for monetary value, wage labor and capital accumulation). Specifically, market relations will still exist but economic units are either nationalized or re-organized into cooperatives. This transitional phase is sometimes described as "state capitalism" or "market socialism".

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_mode_of_production 




 You obviously have not read Marx. Marx stated clearly  that there are several steps societies must take before Communism is perfected. They start with agrarianism, enter industrialism (capitalism), move on to  socialism (which allows for private ownership of industry under government control) and then transforms  into Communism. 

If you studied Marx you would know these basic points. Perhaps you should study a little more before claiming to be a historian? 




 because the state places some economic restrictions on businesses

Some control does not equal total control as is required under socialism. Control does not necessarily mean out right ownership by the state, it simply means things such as the government controls access to raw materials, access to distribution, regulatory control, favoritism, , official exclusion of rivals etc etc 




 Hitler disliked Communists because he thought they were too internationally focused and contained too many Jewish members. As a socialist himself, Hitler considered the Communists and any other political party of any stripe as competition that had to be eliminated. 

In addition, socialists are historically incredibly pro-LGBT, anti-racist, and anti-conservative. Nazi's are conservatives with an anti-LGBT, clearly racist agenda.

Wrong. Can you provide any proof of your wishful claims?

In fact, Socialists were (and still are) among the most violent anti-fascists. 

Wrong again! Did you know that Fascism is also a type of socialism? You know, the part about control over the means of production and distribution and a government centric society at the expense of individual liberty? Did you also know that Mussolini was a devout socialist, was a prolific socialist author, and head of the Italian socialist party? 

I am curious, have you ever taken a college level history or poly sci course? 




 I think i will take Marx's view over your's
