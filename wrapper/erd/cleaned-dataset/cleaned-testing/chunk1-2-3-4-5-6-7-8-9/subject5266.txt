 Really? That's pretty awesome, is the story punchy and short? Thats what I like to see in an indie game, its certain;y the kind of game I want to make. 









 Enslaved? 




 You've reminded me I need to finish Skyward Sword 




 He had almost a Peanuts-style humour about him, strangely mature and insightful for such a youngling. 




 I completely forgot this character existed, seems like Tecmo Koei really love Twilight Princess. 




 already have, it's well made 




 Yes, but difficulty is usually a detriment to my experience. Let me explain. 

I like the idea of high difficulty, but it is rarely used with any great effect and instead of adding to the tone of a game, any sense of tension is deflated by the fact that while you may be vulnerable, your enemies are bullet/hit sponge demi gods.

I like the idea of getting hit once and dying, but I need my enemies to have the same vulnerability, otherwise it's an exercise in grinding and not tension. 

So instead, I often play on easy so enemies go down fast but reset to checkpoint if I get hit by a bullet, like a mentally enforced, pretend high tension difficulty mode.

It's annoying, because how hard is it to put in a difficulty mode where almost everything, including you, dies in one hit? 




 
He slaughters those guys in the bar and then uses that conspirator against King Foltest as bait for the striga.
In the games Geralt seems like he has more of a warm heart, does his character change in the books, or have the games made Geralt more sympathetic?
Don't get me wrong, the book is so far really awesome (got the audiobook), it's just interesting to compare and contrast.

 Morrowind is pretty great for that candy shop feeling. 




 I think it's fair for the devs to want to be secretive too though, it's more special if you don't understand the systems of a game when you first play it. 




 I hope this game isn't being overhyped by people on message boards. It definitely looks like a cool game, but I feel people need to temper expectations, so if it is mindblowing, it will be a nice surprise. 




 Very cool idea! Hope the world is super reactive. 




 So in this game, what are the limitations on freedom? I have never played Elite, but can you land on planets or other ships? Can you get out of your ship? Are any space sims like that?

Or is it mostly UI and flight? 




 I love listening to todd howard talk about game making. Dunno what it is. 




 https://www.youtube.com/user/PrescriptionPixel is a really cool indie game channel, I would love to know about more like this.

and

https://www.youtube.com/user/SonsOfVidya/ is two down to earth guys whose banter I find really funny and not forced. 




 I'm curious about relatively new/small gaming channels that people on /r/games think are really good or interesting.

I enjoy TB and Dodger but sometimes it's cool to see some less prominent talent on YouTube.

I'll post a couple I found down below, in the effort of fairness. Hope to see some good suggestions.

 This definitely looks interesting, I wonder if there will be a mod to change the camera in this game? I don't have anything against people enjoying isometric, but I like to see things up close generally. 




 This sounds excellent, hope to see more 60fps trailers and gameplay demos.  
























 oh cool! 




 it still fits, the squash banana is simba 




 The only thing I would want extra from this game is the ability to make my own character. Making a woman would be cool, for instance, but hey it looks rad anyway so yeh good luck to em. Can't wait to buy it :) 



















 Nice video! Will it be a 60 dollar purchase or subscription? 




 I've never looked into this game much, but can someone tell me if this is correct?

It will be a game where you buy and upgrade your space ship, you can leave your pilots seat at any time and board other ships or walk around space stations. You can use a gun and you can also land on planets (cutscene landing?)

If thats right that sounds really good, but will there be a story or is it more of an MMO experience type deal? 









 I've been to the U.S. and it really is full of lovely people. I think the american political system is horseshit and your social structure is unfair, but god damn, everyone I met over there was so friendly and kind. 









 I love PBS game show :) 









 Bethesda Harry Potter game would be amazing. Going to classes, learning spells, finding hogwarts secrets, having friends (companions) and all of that would be amazing. 




 I really hope they do voice acting in French with english subtitles, love French language :D 




 Looks really awesome, makes me want to go back to working on a proof of concept I did ages ago about a wild animal game:

 Corgi's are amazing! 









 Fear. 




 Writing is still important but its now become a first step for other mediums. Video content comes to mind (youtube videos like "explainers". Good speaking and imagery is important but the writing underneath is why people keep coming back. Edit: sorry, on mobile 




 sounds perfect, do you have a greenlight page? will probably get it

P.s. how did you get into games writing? I'm making my own games currently so I can get some experience writing stories for games. Did you do the same?
 




 Definitely would love to see a Bioshock game that tackles military interventionism, particularly given recent controversies surrounding drone strikes. It can really paint you into a corner when you start creating enemies as a consequence of trying to stop your enemies. If that can be intelligently critiqued I would be pretty stoked.

Along similar lines, I feel systems like the military industrial complex or the surveilance state would also be interesting issues. Metal Gear Solid has already addressed this pretty well already, though albeit in a completely different fashion to what Bioshock could do. 
























 HAHA Lemmings :P thats a decent point, shall be making nose smaller :) 




 Hey what about this do you think I'm joking about? Happy to answer any questions :) 




 This game looks great I can't wait to play it. 




 Haha yeah I always get mixed responses to my goofy art style, I've attempted to try something different and have posted it to the OP, lemme know what you think. 




 :P thanks, yeah these are concepts, not final versions :) the script will be proofed no worries :) 




 Ok fair call, might mess around with different art styles, see if I can use my limited skill with more efficacy. 

Thanks for the feedback :)

EDIT 2: Thankyou so much for all the feedback so far, I have revised the artstyle and altered the character design as people have suggested and this is where I am going:

Basically the game plays like a chose your own adventure/screen based game (maybe like visual novels? I dunno never played one), you have conversations with characters and decide where the plot goes by what the character does and what tale she ends up experiencing :)

I'm planning on having vastly different story threads depending on every choice you make, you could befriend someone or kill them :o - characters could betray you or you may never know their true motivations by the end. 

Because there are going to be a lot of panels, I've chosen a simple artstyle. I may also include a QTE decision system for high pressure moments, but it won't be anything complex, because I don't like complex QTEs.

Would you play this kind of game? 

Edit: wow! thanks for the comments, feedback and upvotes ^_^ 
 









 "War... War has changed..." vs. "War... War never changes..." It's almost like Kojima wrote that line to challenge the inherent view of our culture's tendency to fetishize violence and revere warriors as mythic things instead of seeing them as people who are mistreated by those in power. 

Nice observation! I like it. Good point. 




 Yeah it's kind of like Andy warhol, creating new art from pop culture. 




 I love how Kojima can use a wildly contrasting tone (camp 60's in this case) and still deliver a really serious and compelling criticism of war.

I love how MGS3 basically shows how soldiers are used and abused by governments for their own ends. There is no king and country bullshit here.

MGS is basically pop culture porn, but it is NOT war porn, something I appreciate greatly in the franchise and in a climate where MANY video games and even similar genres are playing up war as "cool" in a direct and shameless fashion - it's nice to see MGS actually having something to say about the shitty state of affairs our world has become. 




 sweet thanks! 




 I have two games in the works currently, the trailer for the first is a free one here (i took a break for a long while so ignore the release date lol)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0rQxQik-zk

The one I'm writing atm on the side is a graphic choose your own adventure type thing. ^_^

How about you? 




 Twine sounds amazing, is it free to use even if you sell your game? I just need it for the "screenplay" so to speak, not the game making, which I'm doing in Construct 2 




 This looks cool! 




 Traditional script writing software has been fine for my linear stories but how do I legibly construct a non linear narrative with different endings? A story tree writing solution would be immensely helpful so any suggestions? Preferably free options :) 









 The Thing is a singleplayer game where any of your team could be infected at any moment and attack you. You have to maintain their trust and if you think someone is turning you have to make hard decisions IIRC. Great game, haven't played it in years though. 




 Not surprised by the American news shows introduction emphasizing the money he makes to legitimize his past time, because money is everything...

not...

He looks like he enjoys his profession and thats the main thing - being happy and not hurting anyone in the process :]

 




 Wow love a new sci fi setting :) 




 Need to finish those Witcher books! Can't wait for this game. 


































 Good Luck! 









 Definitely the worst thing about these games, to be honest, anything that fuels the war machine makes me sad. Glad we have games like Metal Gear, Spec Ops and This War of Mine to spread the counter message. 




 Bokoblins are definitely un-serious asses, haha! https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=i rct=j q= esrc=s source=images cd= cad=rja uact=8 ved=0CAcQjRw url=http%3A%2F%2Fzelda.wikia.com%2Fwiki%2FBokoblin ei=Cdk9VYO_IobdmAXo94CQBw bvm=bv.91665533,d.dGY psig=AFQjCNGckN7KRDSiWz1l4-N4jfQ8zVuHvA ust=1430203024278442 scare the hell out of me in SS though, dunno why! 









 He's super right about the unhelpful behavior on people's part. Gopher seems like a very cordial and kind hearted individual and I agree with him that the negative rage/abuse/bullying etc. is not helping the point of view against the current system.
I feel sorry for the mod authors, simply taking an opportunity presented to them, it's not being a horrible person to want money for your creations.

We just need to be empathetic towards each other as human beings, ya know?

Peace

 I always thought it would be cool to be able to change Link's gender or hair color. 

Thoughts? 




  But why does one thing being a problem mean that we can't try and fix other things?

I agree with you, I'm not saying it's a reason to not try to fix things, I'm more trying to tease out discussion on the topic :) 




 Thanks for your response, the power angle is very interesting. I often compare the power difference when contemplating other subjects, good idea to apply it here. 




 Could you expand on that? I'm aware of that idea that sexualized women + the violence can direct the tone in a really unsettling fashion (e.g. hitman), but does sexualization inherently and problematically tie into violence for every game? Bikini chainmail female warrior fighting a monster, is that sexual violence when compared to a beautiful man in no clothes fighting the same monster?

I'm not arguing the idea, I can feel there's something wrong there but I need further clarification to build my own understanding. 

Thanks :) 




 Thankyou interesting point. 




 Yeah Jim Sterling did a very good video about this a while ago, actually. Its an interesting point. 




 good point, changed my post specifically about the design and not other elements of objectification. 




 Accidently deleted my text in my post, so I have to redo:

If 50% of objectified characters were adult men, in the exact same fashion as the sexualized adult women (not the male idol fallacy, but actual objectification for the straight female gaze, or whatever) would that help the situation of objectified characters?

I should note I'm not talking about third person leery camera movements, I'm talking about design of the character. I don't think anyone really likes cringeworthy camera shots of a boob or bum or a package, but if a character is wearing skimpy clothing and they own it - equally between the sexes, does it become less of an issue?

I understand two wrongs don't make a right, but if we are going to focus on moral issues in games, isn't violence more problematic in that regard? 

I'm a sex positive bisexual male, so I'm definitely not interested in sex and sexuality being a taboo and I don't mind looking at objectified men in games either!, but I am not in the right position to make a clear assessment myself so I'm curious what people's thoughts are on adult characters being treated 50-50 equivelant. 




 That is amazing! 




 Hey man, sorry you didn't like the post, what do you think immersion means in terms of gameplay?

Cheers :) 




 This game sounds a lot more interesting than I initially assumed, the art style looks beautiful and the adventuring looks simple but fun! gonna have to try it out, nice! 




 If a game has a female protagonist, it much more easily grabs my interest. I just really enjoy playing as another gender than my own, it's like games give me an experience I don't have in my day to day that I can empathize with and find appeal in.

Saving this video. 




 Thanks everyone! I have added a revised art style at the top of the post :) lemme know what I can change :) 
























 Systems that organically integrate with the world helps this.


3 traits help combat? not necessary, have 1. Its one clear system.

But maybe theres a platforming system so tie a trait to that.

Maybe there's a dialogue system - another trait.

Make them distinct and related to a single system, then design a game that really interweaves those systems.

Instead of interweaving traits in skills that stack up over one system:

E,g. Combat = int, agi, str, const etc.
Dialogue = cha, int, str, 




 Is it coming to pc? 




 Tetris music was amazing back in the day. Loved listening to it :P 




 I am so glad I had MGS4 already installed when I went to play it again today :P 




 ah ok, just saw it in the film and wondered if the lettering was deliberate 




 I made a video about this sort of topic recently and it uploaded just today! Specifically related to physical contact with NPC's (non-violent contact).

www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ossk41vamBk

I love little details in games! Makes them so much more immersive and varied in the experience. 









 Can't wait for this on PC, I think it's really cool how much they are changing up for fans as well as new console players. 




 Just wanted to thank everyone for the kind words, I'd thank you all individually but I don't want to spam the thread. Really glad I could communicate a different way of tackling it. 




 Haha, wow, thanks I think!

:) 





























 Hes a tragic villain, but becoming the monster we see hinted at in the games is still becoming a villain. Even Solid Snake didnt see himself as a hero. His father with his PMC and his vendetta against the world that fucked him doesn't make him anything remotely good.

Can't wait to see it unfold though, each game he's gotten worse and worse this is gunna be really fucking sad and horrific. Even sadder when you see what his mentor chose in peacewalker. 














 Big Boss is turning into the villain though, so it's likely his character arc will make more sense to play more lethally. There may even be forced killing missions??

I'm okay with that given we are playing a character we KNOW is a villain and the series has always said something interesting and critical about war. It's not got the jingoistic tone of say, Splinter Cell Blacklist. 









 The guy is a master of languages, I'm sure he could pick up Polish for a Witcher film. 




 He really is a great choice, I totally agree with you. Stunning actor and he's not typical American/British/Australian choices you might see for this kind of film. 
























 I'm a guy, but I love the idea that even in such a story focused game with a Male lead, there are options to play as Female members of mother base for the open world missions. That's really cool, to me. I wonder how far it extends? Story missions are probably exempt? 









 This is great! Imagine if life was like Animal Crossing, everything be so simple y'all. This music would play every morning. haha

note: except tom nook would be our slave masters.  




 What about the game do you dislike? I think it's fair to say most people have experiences where the masses like something and you don't, there's nothing wrong with that :) plenty of games to enjoy after all :) 




 I borrowed MW2 from a workmate, I had huge problems with the way it portrayed militarism and heroism - it *felt* like propaganda. Didn't even finish it. 




 Noah. Underrated and amazing film. 




 Its the internet I spose theres always going to be some people complaining about something 




 Indictment on patriotism and allegiance, through a tragic lens vs a patriotism fuelled Tv show. Tonally very different series' imho 




 They are two very different characters opposites in intent and design too. But Kiefer is a good actor, because if anything Jack Bauer character in a game with the tone of "Platoon" is kind of incongruous. 

But Kiefer already impressed me in trailers and GZ :) 




 I thought he was great in GZ to offer a counter opinion.  




 Snake and Bauer are completely different characters on opposite spectrums in many senses. That said Kiefer is a good actor and I doubt it will be the 24 jingoistic action man thing for Metal Gear. 




 Yeah, I heard that there is a ton of tapes, Videogamer did a great preview of the game on their youtube channel I highly recommend. 




 Yeah, I've been extremely impressed so far. 




 In Peace Walker, the tapes were specific to missions and stuff, so it will probably still be contextual. Videogamer's recent preview said they don't understand how Kojima Productions could have made as many tapes as they have. So I assume there are a lot! 




 To defend them they aren't the biggest studio and they have a lot less shackles on their systems than most games almost guaranteeing some bugs :)

They also have an insane ability to establish a sense of place.  




 I want an easy mode in dark souls - i've used guides but alt tabbing out of the world is immersion breaking. I love the atmosphere and design but I personally don't want a challenge in that way. I respect people that do though.

I also understand forcing no easy mode is Good to introduce people to new things. But I want a mod or something, personally :) i like the idea of less challenge.

Scared to write this post but there you have it :) 




 Codec calls are tapes now you can listen to them while playing its more convenient that way I reckon. :) 









 We would but the sub has self promotion rules :o :P 




 Sort of, if i could distill it i would say there would be:

1 skill/trait 1-100 for dialogue efficacy
1 skil/traitl 1-100 for combat efficacy
1 skill/trait 1-100 for magic efficacy
1 skill/trait 1-100 for stealth efficacy
1 skill/trait 1-100 for athleticism

None of those stats overlap into other mechanics, but if the game is designed with all those mechanics in mind it makes picking skills more of a "what i want to do" scenario instead of "how do i make my stats balance so my character good at this?"

Skyrim sort of does this, i think. 









 Yes and no.

Yes single skills for gameplay but have so many gameplay elements that upgrading those skills in different combinations and ratios makes it fun.

E.g.

I want to have a stealth assasin so I will put points into combat, stealth, and athletics

I want a stealth ghost so I swap combat for magic, so i can cast invisibility.

I want a wise talking theif? I choose stealth, dialogue and athletics.

Imagine the points directly correlating to how much X Y Z gameplay elements you wabt to engage with.

Instead of having dialogue split up amongst skills reverse it so the skills are split into specific mechanics. 
























 Really? Cos I've seen videos where she talks about games she likes. Also basically all of her criticisms on youtube start with "it's possible to both simultaneously enjoy and criticize", which is true, not many games are 100% perfect. 

I think people are very sensitive about what she says instead of accepting that like many critics out there she only mentions something if it's a problem. That doesn't = she hates all games. I prefer her positive criticism, of what I've seen, though, but I like positive criticism from most people, negativity is less appealing to me personally. 




 Sounds like you've got quite the list already, good luck! Don't feel bad if a game doesn't click, if you've got something else to try there's nothing wrong with changing things up. Have fun! 




 Am i the only one who likes engaging with all forms of polite criticism including hers? She makes some good points sometimes so I think its unfair to generalise about her work.

I don't always agree, but its good to hear different views. 




 Walking dead is so sad ): never cried in a game before, but wow, i cried so so much :/ 




 Makes sense PC is easier to develop for, given the open platform :) 




 I'm assuming you are an adult, cos some of these games are only suitable for age 18+

**Deus Ex Human Revolution** - First person action RPG shooter/stealth game, dialogue options and cyberpunk storyline.

**Saints Row 4** - Parody/comedy game, follow a bunch of (strangely likable) psychopaths saving the world. Extensively create your own character, pick female or male protagonist with multiple voice options. Game parodies games like Mass Effect, I love ME and this game was very entertaining for me.
Trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51OztTj9r5M

**Any of these telltale games** (contains dialogue options, almost like an interactive movie or TV show - not super long and the last two aren't all out yet, gameplay is mostly quicktime events and dialogue):

 I love that log bridge in Skyrim, it feels so epic fighting over a waterfall. 

Falling off a cliff on my horse in Red Dead Redemption :/ and I'm fairly sure that's actually quite hard to do! 




 I do gaming criticism/comment (also develop my own little games) - but I focus on keeping a positive perspective. It's an attempt to counter the tone of videos that focus on anger/outrage. 

I've tried not to post the channel too much on reddit because of self promotional rules, so if anyone wants to share them if they like them, feel free :)

Only two videos so far, but got lots planned :) Enjoy! 

Peace

 Find games that you enjoy and you want to play, don't let other people tell you what games are the "right" games to play. If you need recommendations, what kinds of games/stories are you interested in? I'm sure people here could recommend some, for PS2 right? 




 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUCZVL49fTP8lKX-taX_cpA/videos

Well nobody asked :) Done two so far, the latest is probably the slickest.   




 The beauty of the internet is you can probably find communities and content creators that suit your tastes. 

I personally have misgivings about the very pessimistic and snarky tone the dialogue about this art form has cultivated. I dislike outrage culture very strongly - I feel like that energy could be better spent on actual world problems. Although cordial and polite critique on a variety of issues is absolutely fine. I agree with you about Danny O'Dwyer, but I like him because he's calm, clear and concise. He doesn't beat the outrage drum, and I appreciate that. 

Conversely to you, I actually like many elements of every outlet you mentioned. However, broadly speaking any sort of outrage turns me off, this is supposed to be an artform for discussion, not anger, bitterness or incivility - at least that's how I feel about it.

 




 He was basically naked lol :P nah ur right i meant Big Boss in Mgs3 and Peacewalker 




 A suicide squad game would be awesome, I just hope they make sure Harley Quinn is more of a goofball psychopath, rather than the sexy booby schtick the Arkham games have given her. What can I say, I love classic Harley ;) 




 Unfortunately, a lot of popular games videos and stories revolve around outrage and they get voted to the top. I strongly believe this can be counteracted through passionate, but positive, games videos and articles. 

E.g. Superbunnyhops MGS2 video - insightful, but also positive. 

I've started making videos on the basis of not being negative or angry, for that very reason. Hopefully one day they will be popular enough for people to post on /r/games 




 Haha, yeah fair call. Snake has a "naked" getup ever since MGS3 I believe, so maybe, here's hoping she's got some different getups like proper camo etc. 




 I am so interested to see how the themes of this game play out. GZ was a brutal condemnation of Gitmo, always loved how Kojima fits smart with the surreal/off-beat.

I also love how you don't always have to play as snake, which is cool. 




 I only really watch Criminal Intent would have defs played a telltale game with Goren and Eames 




 See their portraits in the menu, also i think quiets costume can be changed in the menu too. 




 With the 12x XP Boost the game is great now, I managed to level up to 50 with my Jedi Knight in a few days when it had took me 3 years on and off to just get my Sith Warrior to Lvl 40.

I've been playing on and off F2P, what is a 12x xp boost and how do I get one? I also just play for story. 




 It's the same actor, but I don't think the characters will be the same at all. At least I hope not. 




 My biggest issue with Arkham Games is the redesign of Harley Quinn, It's not a game breaker for me, but I always loved Harlequin designed Harley. I don't feel she needs to be "attractive" in terms of sexuality. She's more of a goofball maniac after all. 




 Yeah! Something eerie, but appealing about Animal Crossing's "perfect life" atmosphere. haha.

 
























 Yeh but there's lots of cultural stuff we don't adhere to anymore, so its not really an excuse, although I know you're not excusing it 




 Mgs has never been that subtle in terms of exposition, so I didn't see a discord. 




 Kojima's games are very anti-war so I expect this game to be no different and potentially more confronting including the child soldier stuff mentioned in other games.

Its most likely going to be the most hellish game of the series' given the characters, subject matter and it evoking classic anti war Oliver Stone films like Platoon. 




 Played Peace Walker before this second time playing MGS4...

Big Boss' death ;_; omg so damn fucking tragic.

All the regret and sorrow for what he did to the world, chained to the shackles of his ideals of "liberty". Giving Solid the true freedom to stop fighting and take peace.

Holy fuck, after Peace Walker too, when The Boss AI accepts peace and this angers Big Boss in that game, here you see him finally accept it.

Jesus christ, this is the same game where a weirdo soldier poops his butt for a whole act. Lol.

Seriously, fantastic ending. 




 Awesome 




 This looks great! How did they make this? I prefer new tomb raider but old TR is cool too :) is this based on an alien invasion? Will it feature the orson welles radioplay? Omg that'd be amazing, imagine that - probably copyright issues though with that. 




 Fair enough, I definitely think there is a huge space for historically accurate games! History is so damn rich and it's weird that Ubisoft is the only AAA dev to really use it outside of wars. 




 hows gaming on it? steam, gog, etc? 









 To be fair to Assassin's creed, those games engage people with history far more than most other popular media. When I played Assassin's creed, I won't deny that I googled the American revolution to get more immersed in the world. Whose to say other people didn't delve even further as a result?

Think I'm going to do a video on that at some point actually, could be interesting topic. 














 Iran is such a fascinating country with a tumultuous history, I absolutely loved "The Cat and the Coup" - a free, simple and interesting, game on steam. Gives you some interesting political history about the country in the 50's, which might give some good background/context to the next 1979 revolution? I can't remember.

This will be very interesting to see the 1979 revolution. Wow. I am actually really excited, I love seeing non-western centric politics in games, it just feels a bit refreshing ya know?

 




 Yeah basically anything fan service-y (right word yes?) is pretty cringe. That said, I wouldnt mind seeing it even out with:

1. Less scantily clad women
2. More sexualised men

Sexuality in and of itself is not a bad thing. It is bad when the character is an object to the audience and/or is dressed/acts to allure the audience.

Positive example: MGS4 is an ass simulator, and whose ass you looking at? Snakes. (Ignoring the leery camerawork on the women in the game here)

I think the main issue is when women are treated like sexual objects for audience pleasure in games. The game of war ad evokes that, although Kate Upton im sure IRL is a very capable human being.

Snake, on the otherhand, is a fully realized character and also happens to wear skin tight outfit with no shame in his old muscley man body. If that can be conveyed with a woman that would be no real issue to me. 




 I see no benefit to starting a witch hunt, which is the kind of thing that happens inadvertedly after these kinds of reviews, especially to smaller devs with no PR, company or fanbase - based on a few kickstarter discrepancies. 

People attributing malice is pretty extreme accusation.  




 They might have got friends and family to chip in? Kickstarter is a complete gamble, I don't feel it has the credence to justify an outrage if you pay money to a kickstarter (an obscure one at that) it's not the same as thinking your buying a finished product. 

In terms of Steam, there are refunds these days anyway. 

This review seems out of place, I am still uncomfortable it was published in this current fashion, given the potential online knock on effects. 




 People equate honesty in disliking something with being agressive, I see that as a false equation. You can recommend against buying a game without dropping outrage that will inadvertedly spur on a huge audience to make this devs life miserable. 

1 . Ending a review with "Unfortunately I didn't enjoy this game much, especially the character models, which needed more work to scare me. I hope the developer can learn from these points with future games. 1/10" is different from "Oh, and the scary little girl looks shit. 1/10"

They convey different attitudes to the audience.

2 . Jim is a top tier reviewer, there are games with bigger potential audiences that would probably appreciate a review from him more than a small indie dev who probably didnt' expect to get much attention at all. There are knock on effects to doing an anomalous review in this way.

It's a sledgehammer approach the gaming community often misapplies.  




 People will use words like "scam" to justify their own torrents of disdain, though. Feeling righteous is the path to actually doing a lot of damage, sadly. His audience could easily take this way too far based off the "feeling" of the review alone.

I also don't agree with the idea that small games shouldn't be criticized, because people have feeling.I also don't agree with the idea that small games shouldn't be criticized, because people have feeling.

Criticism comes in many different forms, and some are more appropriate than others, especially with context. You can say very similar messages in different ways. Obviously no one is saying they can't be criticized, but what about constructive criticism? Why does there have to be a tone of outrage to the review, what does that do to improve the lives of consumers and creators? 




 Jim, when talking about a game he enjoys, is actually the reason I keep abreast of his work. He does brilliant explanations on why he loves something in a game.

Re: Squirty plays, I like them when Jim enjoys the game, when he dislikes it, it sometimes gets out of hand, especially when you see the audience comments afterwards. Even when Jim doesn't use pejorative language, the comments may do it anyway :/

To be fair though, there are some Squirty plays that Jim probably isn't enjoying, but still plays it earnestly and without pejorative language.

I find the whole "honest reaction" thing a bit skewed, though, because while we may occaisionally swear "honestly" at the TV or whatever in our private homes, it's not the same when you broadcast that to an audience of thousands who will then interpret and run with it in numerous, often incorrect, ways. 




 Yeah look, most people would expect some criticism for any game they put out there (I plan on releasing a game at some point, after all). Unfortunately, with a high profile critic (with a huge audience) and a review that gives it a 1/10 without much context as to who the dev is and the last word of the review being "shit" - well, that's a nuclear strike for a smaller developer.

Consider this: huge companies have had to mobilize huge PR teams to counter Jim's ire and the audience reaction that comes with it.

I dunno, I just feel uncomfortable about this kind of review. 




 That second user comment on the review page (from user "The Gustavler") :/ not cool

I feel Jim would be happier if he focused on other games instead of finding small games he can tear into. How much of his audience would have played this game? How many are going to play it now and flood the developers page with vitriol because of this review? What will that achieve?

Im worried about the negative aura gaming community is cultivating.

Anyway I really enjoy Jim's work generally speaking, just prefer less negativity. 




 Classic Harley Quinn Design ? 10/10 will buy 
























 I actually hope Bethesda pick him/them all up. They are traditionally a solid SP company and had Mikami for evil within, so its possible yeah? 




 Bethesda would be my favorite pick. They are very supportive of new and interesting visions and have the bank to back it up. 




 Jeeeeez, that's one amazing picture, what a tribute. Says so much ;_; he seemed like such a nice man its so great to see that warmth returned by people honouring him. 




 It's nice to see him being recognized en masse like this, he genuinely seemed like lovely guy and I think everyone can agree Nintendo's ability to have fun with itself and just enjoy entertaining others is an admirable trait. I'm so sad for his family, friends and coworkers, he has definitely left his mark on Nintendo. They will remember him well.

RIP 




 They weren't to know, but there is a lesson here about trying our best to be a happier and more upbeat gaming community. I know I've said some pretty demanding/angry things about Nintendo in the past - this was wrong to do and I've since been more positive and flexible to change/ideas.

I really enjoyed their latest conference, there was always a sense of fun and not taking things too seriously when it came to Nintendo pressers/directs, so maybe we as a community should strive to meet that standard. 

Have fun, enjoy the games we love.

Peace and Love, RIP Mr. Iwata, you did an amazing job :) 3 




 The only way to win in war is not to play. I believe the game plays off this concept.

Lets play out the alternative, if you could choose be a "good guy" and not kill anyone wouldn't it detract from the experience?

Walk away cut to credits? A neat easter egg, but most players will take the bad route to see what happens.

Also, the game works best when you don't expect the guilt. Heaps of military games make you kill people thoughtlessly and this game is trying to trap people in that mindset and then turn it on them.
 




 House of Cards and Fallout 3 both have this really interesting tone with the use of Snare Drum and Horns, to evoke the feel of Washington DC. Captain America Winter Soldier also does this.

I was wondering if there was a term for it? 




 APologies, not my video, so I didn't know what to cut out! I also felt I had to add the spoiler tag and the name of the channel. So I missed up sorry :/ 




 He's basically a huge catalyst of events but does it all happen off screen? I thought PO would have him feature, but he wasn't in it at all, til the end, but he doesn't speak.

Am I missing something? Cos by Peace Walker snake and zero already are against each other. 









 You can switch between controls in the RE1 remake can't you? I swear you could. 




 Fantastic Interview, he's so genuine, love his work. 




 I'm more worried that the message, what Metal Gear says about war (i.e. criticizing it), will be ignored in any future non-Kojima MGS titles, turning it into a gung-ho military propaganda piece :/ . 

Then again, I could be worrying pre-emptively, I'm sure there are other staff that "get" the series' core ideas 




 I played through the whole 3D series just recently and didn't notice any of that. Canon isn't what I'm after in MGS, afterall, it's more fluid to me than most universes, so I'm willing to accept extreme twists. 




 Why, you can't enjoy a game because of it's politics? Not that I am saying this specifically is a "political" game. 

E.g. Metal Gear Solid is improved because of it's political ideas on the evils of war, for instance. 




 You saying I'm speaking for them :/ jeez, no. If anything I'm defending this game from being dismissed cos some people don't like outlets that happened to like the look of it. Seems unfair, and it's good to see such an interesting game come around now and then. 




 Is it reasonable for me to be worried that they might turn metal gear into a simplistic gung ho, jingoistic military series after he leaves?

Kojima's themes and the commentary on war (basically a systemic criticism of warfare, society and nuclear proliferation) was what made that series shine... 




 I see what you are saying but I believe the head dude making it is Iranian (lives in America?) I could be wrong, also those are some of the few movies with eastern people doesnt mean the portrayal will be the same because of the same actors.

I've been playing MGS recently and Venom Snake and Jack Bauer are two completely different characters being played by the same actor, as an example :) 




 Isn't that overly presumptuous? Why be so pessimistic? 




 I voted looks engaging! 




 I like polygon and rps they do good stuff, never heard that hashtag before. 




 Whats this about snake and otacon?
