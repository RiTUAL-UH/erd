 I drew a few drawings, and that's about it! 




 I am doing fine and I am very sleepy as it's almost 1am here :) What about you? 




 Hello! 




 Our Lord is testing your faith. Don't join the ugly shills at Cyanocorp. 




 5.5.0


Damn, you are futuristic. 




 Nope, no idea about it as I have never been there :( 









 Yes, it's similar in India! It's unbearably hot here, too. 




 It's 12am here and I turned 16 just now! Feels awesome :) 




 Naut 3 is a really good theme and it would make the sub look elegant. 









 I had been working on it since 4 hours and I made this app which doesn't do much! Feels great :) 














 Comcast= Literally Hitler


Hitler=  Approved Prophet


Therefore, Comcast is an Approved Company. 














 Just curious as many people don't seem to know about it. 









 Please be serious here. Did 5.1 manage to fix your 5.0 complaints? Because I am getting quite stellar performance on 5.1... 














 Praise DuARTe! 









 Stop this sub from being infected with Galaxy S6 shills!


**DO IT FOR DUARTE!** 









 It's 1st April!

**Disclaimer to moderators:**
Slight OT is fine, but when users decide to act stupid they should be dealt with with the appropriate means - its really annoying for me when OT turns crazy. Please put the warning/ban hammer anytime any of you think there's lack of respect and/or too much unwanted OT crap - but if it doesn't meet this criteria let the OT posts alone. Thank you.

Cheers! 




 Is it a massive battery drain or a light one? 
























 Just curious as I just got my  N7 2013 and I wanted to flash a kernel. Also, as this is essentially a Snapdragon 600, is it safe to overclock it to 1.7 GHz? 






















































 ... For not updating the Steam app to material design. 









 Go to developer options and tick "Disable HW overlays". I haven't experienced any redraws after that. 
























 Google's developers took a couple of weeks off for the holidays  or from my perspective, they gave me a couple of weeks to rest  but now they're back and it's time for the app updates to resume. Naturally, it's time to breathe life back into the teardowns, and we're back with a  VERY big one. Google Search v50.2 began rolling out to users yesterday, and we've already seen quite a few HUGE adjustments and improvements. After plenty of digging, a stack of additional changes have surfaced, including one that is already live, and several more just waiting for some finishing touches including the much awaited **Project Food**. 
             **Disclaimer**: Teardowns are, by their nature, speculative and based on incomplete evidence. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. There is always a chance that details may change or plans may be cancelled prior to launch of a new feature. As with all rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced.
        
* **'Ok Google Make me a Sandwich'**
By far, this is the biggest feature Google has implemented. This is the first step to Google's ambitious 'Project Food'.  Just say the phrase "OK Google, Make me a sandwich" and lo, your sandwich will be made by your mobile! This will, according to Google, go a long way in providing free food to everyone.

* **Excitement for the future**
There are subtle hints dropped for us to see that Project Food is about to come. For example, when we saw the code, there was a line which mentioned, "OK Google, make me a burger." This probably means that Project Food will cover a variety of foods, ranging from burgers to sandwiches. 
Here is the code we observed
     string name="search_pref_header""OK Google, Make me a burger"/string
     string name="search_bluetooth_pref_title"Make a burger/string
     string name="search_headset_pref_title"BURGER BURGER!/string
     string name="search_headsets_confirmation_title"BURGER PROCESSING!/string
     string name="search_headsets_confirmation_body"YOUR BURGER IS READY TO EAT!!!!!/string


*  **Wrap-Up**
* That's about it for this teardown. It's clear Google is preparing quite a few changes for the coming months, and there's definitely something for everybody on this list. It's only January, and there's already a lot showing up in the Search app, so by the time I/O rolls around, most of this list will probably be live and we'll have a whole new set of foods to eat. I think it's going to be a good year for food junkies.

 This problem is resolved if I use a headphone. But why is this happening? 




 This didn't happen before... 














 Personally, I prefer Philz because of its interface. 




 Boxing gloves to punch the shills. 














 What can I do? Please help. 














 Do you face the same annoying launcher redraws on the GPE ROM? 




 Seeing that it did not bring any significant performance improvement, is the ART runtime insignificant? 



















 The old AOSP Messaging, or the new Google Messenger? 





























 Same with me, I have never even taken a selfie, let alone posting it :( 




 Think you forgot Ingress? 




 You guys don't understand, Lord DuARTe uses a Macbook to keep an eye on the enemy. 




 India... 




 Blazing hot. 40C/104F. 




 Thanks for the advice, I would definitely try that today! 




 But how do I go about drawing them... When I draw real-life people, they turn out to be a complete disaster :( 




 But my drawings will look very amateurish to you!...


[Here's one!](http://i.imgur.com/ZBMROO6.jpg) 




 Great! I never can do as good as that! 




 Yes!!! 




 Even I am glad that I took it up. Really helps me utilise my free time. Can you show me one of your drawings? :D 




 I did realize the fact, that's why I inserted it there :P


I quit drawing a few years back, but this year I started to love it again, and I started spending more of my time on it... 




 I live in Maharashtra... 




 I love drawing catoons! (and sneks, lol jk). What do you like to draw? :) 




 **MY EYES ARE RELIEVED!!** 




 I am in India, and I just finished the 10th grade exams... 




 I love drawing, and tinkering with my mobile... 




 What about you? 




 Ummm... You would find me a wierd personality, as I never listen to music and I don't play games... 




 I am just watching a few vids... 




 XD. So, what are you doing?

 You saw Interstellar?

 Yes! 




 I've never read horror books, too. 




 Which ones do you like? 




 I have no work to do currently :( Just browsing reddit... 




 I never watch horror movies. Do you read books? 




 No. *Hint: The country which your team defeated in the Cricket World Cup semifinals* 




 Thanks! What do you plan to do now? 




 If you like animated movies, you would love to watch Home! It's a cute movie :D 




 Yep. 




 Nothing, just browsing CC, nothing to do :( What about you? 




 Hi, just feeling very bored!

 Nah... 




 I doubt... 




 Now guess where I live...

 I would, for sure. 3 of my friends have come over, will you be there in 2 hours? Will catch up with you! 




 I bought a Sketchers running shoes for my birthday! 




 I woke up and read the newspaper. That's about it :P In the evening, I would go for running, as I am excited about my new shoes :) 




 Hi! So, how's your day going? 




 Hey, no problem mate. :D 




 Thanks a lot! 




 Power cut at my place, and I switched to my mobile. Really can't do much at 1.20 AM without lights :'(

 Not Sunday yet, though! But Saturday's almost over :)

 Hey! What's up? 




 Hey, what's going on? 




 Happy birthday! 




 The British spellings are always used in my country, so I prefer them.

 Yes! Sure! I would love to :D

 Hmmm... No... I am not frustrated, but I just never listen to it. I never feel like listening to music... 




 You're not alone. I don't care about any kind of music. 




 He's a time traveller. 




 I don't care about an SO at this stage... 




 I'm from India!

 #NoSOMasterRace 




 You're just like me! 




 No SO... 




 Lucky you, that's it's cold... I am burning here at 41C... 




 It was released last month... 




 Also, I am making a ton of typing errors today on my mobile :P 




 A group of aliens invade earth and shift all the humans to some part Australia. Only a girl remains in New York city and she tries to find her mother along with an alien. A really good movie :) 




 And as for other animated movies, did you see Home? 




 Frozen! And I am big fan of other animated movies too... Which was the last Disney movie you watched? 




 Don't post a selfie. 




 I still watch Disney movies, too... I love them :D 




 It was similar here, too! There used to be a Mickey mouse show on free TV! 




 I love Disney! 




 I still watch these, reminds me of my childhood...   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ycRnLo5HQU 




 But they always end up in the play offs... 




 I just followed the scores, I am watching IPL... 




 Pretty late :P 




 I love cricket! 




 I am up because it's 11.30 AM here. 




 Praise SfR!

 Soo... When do you plan to sleep? 




 Pretty obvious, it's /u/shillfrombrad. 




 Not doing much in my free time... Reading books, drawing, and tinkering with my mobile... And Just Books is near-ish to my house, too! 




 No problem! 




 Yep, 10th boards...


You could try JustBooks library... It has a big collection of books... 




 I was trying Android app development, but now I am reading a book... I don't care if I wake up late as my boards got over... 




 Indeed, small world! :D

 Pune :)

You from Asia? 




 Hmmm... Didn't really see the SOT as my sister is not home now-a-days... But I will try to let you know by tommorow. I can confirm though, it does not take a big hit.  




 Same here. Second Gen Dual SIM. 




 Visit this sub. 




 Not exactly, I am using Lollipop on my sister's Moto g 2nd Gen, and it's fine... 




 I am doing this : https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/building-ui.html 




 I am fine, but very sleepy as it is 12.40 AM here! 




 Yeah, that's what I had! 




 Indian food... 




 You have a Moto G. Why don't you just upgrade? 




 Hey, what's up? 




 Also, the best place for this would be /r/PickAnAndroidForMe.
 




 Buy the Moto G first gen. It has a better display than moto e. But if you an SD card slot, why don't you consider the Moto E 2nd gen? 




 #MKBHD IS A SHILL!

 Nothing much, just riding and drove into a car which was parked XD

 11th and 12th would be Science stream, and then I would probably go for Computer Science... 




 Yup, will be pursuing Science stream...

 Yup. 




 What about a Nexus 5? I am getting one on eBay... 




 But Asus is horrible with updates...
 




 My 10th grade just ended! 




 What does Junior grade mean? There's nothing like that in my country...

 Plus, Android 5.1.1 on the Nexus 5 is a joy to use. 




 Photo taken with an iPhone. 




 I hate TouchWiz. 




 Awesome!!! 




 The Nexus 5 is pretty good at this stage. You still get all the updates, it's stock Android, and the hardware is still good. The phone still runs like a champ. Do you really need a Galaxy S6, then?...  




 Dare: go to /r/circlejerk and post "Comcast is actually good." 




 You deliver!!! 




 Go to /r/androidcirclejerk and post "iOS is awesome!". 




 Truth!

 DuARTe is all forgiving. 




 No. I don't. 




 Yes, I do think of it as an art... 




 He told me on /r/India once... 




 I just don't listen to it. 




 By tunes like that, I mean that it's the only one I rarely listen to... 




 I am just not interested in it... 




 There used to be a time when I did like it, but later I just lost interest... But very rarely, I do listen to soothing tunes like 'Come September'... 




 But Material is the latest, and should be loved more. 




 Ummm... I don't really think so... I attribute it more to the fact that I anever really had any interest in music, I always preferred to do something else rather than listening to music...  




 Thank God, I am not alone!

Don't insult Project Butter! 




 Then make it Materialification Nation! 




 I love Disney movies! 




 Something that I just don't do... I don't know why, but I never listned to it. 




 I am going to watch Tangled now on my laptop :) 




 Is music really that necessary? 




 That's even hard to imagine for me, never ecxperienced it... So, what are you planning to do now? 




  There have been droughts in areas around my city as well. And the droughts here are bad. Like, water only once a day for the villages. But the cities get a consistent water supply. 




 No, the rains are okay here... What about your place? 




 No. I don't listen to radio, and there's no elevator music here... 




 I hope rain comes here, too :D 




 At 106 even the AC feels ineffective :(

 Yeah, it's kinda good here... What's the temperature at your place? 




 And that's what you've RES tagged me as well... :P

 That's the normal summer temperature here... 




 Yes, no music at all...

 Well... I don't listen to music, so people find me weird... 




 It's horribly hot here :( 




 I am too damn bored today...

 Yeah, Mountain Dew is refreshing, but I try to stay away from such drinks... 




 Drinking cold water. It's the best way to relax :P 




 India. Horribly hot here. 41C/106F. 




 Thanks for the info! 




 You can flash ROMs? Does the iOS bootloader allow that? 




 But you cannot flash ROMs/Kernels on a jailbroken iPhone...  




 But a rooted Android can provide much more functionality than a jailbroken iPhone...

 I feel like it's a waste of time and energy...

 But still, it cannot match the versatility of Stock Android...

 I'm from Maharashtra in India. Just finished my 10th grade exams... 




 Hi! I'm from India and I am a student.

 ## I CYANOCIDED MY S2 TO ALLEVIATE THE HORRORS OF TOUCHJIZZ!!!!!!


Mr. Shillfrombrad has been made a mod of /r/cyanogenmod.






 




 Isn't this kinda a.... repost? 




  S2 was one of my favourite phones



Mr. Shillfrombrad has been made the mod of /r/Samsung. 




 A honey-comb has been built at least 1000 times outside my window... 
























 Not no. 3. No 2 is a lie. 




 Aladdin was a really good film, and Robin Williams made it excellent. I miss Disney's hand drawn films... 




 I love animated films.



I use an iPhone.



I love Android. 




 But stock Android is aesthetically much better. 




 I would draw something today... 




 Baymax is the most lovable character :D 




 Do check it out, it's really good! 




 I loved Frozen as well! 




 Most of them aren't kid's movies these days. I am super-excited for Inside Out, which appears nowhere close to a children's movie. 




 Paperman is a really good movie. One of my favorite shorts, along with Feast. 




 Even I am a huge fan of animated movies! I prefer them over normal movies. 




 Up was awesome. I love most of the Pixar films. 




 Lion King is a classic. 




 But Fantasia 2000 was a disappointment :( 




 The Toy Story trilogy is simply amazing! 




 Aladdin was great, especially Robin Williams! 




 But it feels bad that Ego lost his job :( 




 Does it require proof? 




 Wall-E is amongst my favourite movies. A truly amazing movie, and my favourite Sci-Fi movie ever.  




 Musafa's death is the saddest part :'( 




 The Toy Story trilogy is truly awesome! 




 I've never seen a Miyazaki film :( 




 The Incredibles, like most of the Pixar films, is awesome. 




 I liked Wreck-it Ralph a lot, especially Ralph's and Vanellope's character. 




 Mine would be Big Hero 6 and Toy Story! 




 It's bloated and ugly. 




 The layer that Samsung puts over Android. 




 TouchWiz is bad. 




 TouchWiz. 




 implying a Nexus 6 can be destroyed. 




 When are you planning to sleep? 




 Am? 




 What's the time at your place? 




 So, what's up? 




 Hey! Last night I was trying a difficult drawing, and I messed up :(

 Sure! I will PM you once my college starts :) 




 I will try to do that... 




 That's what I want to do! But let's hope I can get there... 




 What are you planning to pursue? 




 I kinda attend often. Like, once a month... I am there for 10 mins or so...  




 I visited a temple today! 




 7pm here! 




 It's evening here :) 




 Even his face is a bit similar! 




 Even I am loving this site! 




 Yes, the expressions of Genie were amazing! And he looks kinda like Williams, too! 




 I'm fine! What about you? 




 His Genie's role is my favorite, though! 




 Yeah, but the movie was disappointing, not befitting to an actor of his calibre. The first part was excellent, though. 




 Sorry, the last one o saw was night at the museum 3, which was pretty disappointing :( 




 The last Robin Williams movie I watched in the theaters was Night at the Museum 2... 




 The voice of Robin Williams is excellent! 




 India. 




 I watched Aladdin yesterday, and I loved it too :) 




 I just saw Big Hero 6 and Tangled, and I loved them :D 




 Saw any movies lately? 




 Hey, what's up? 




 It's almost 3 PM here... 




 Yes, it's 2.15 pm here... 




 Even I loved Elsa's character! I just drew her, too... 




 Yes! 




 Unfortunately, my exams were going on when it was released :( Now, I plan to watch Frozen again... 




 It's 10.55 AM here... 




 I am curretly on a Disney movie watching spree... In 5 days, I saw Tangled, Big Hero 6 thrice, and Aladdin... 




 Yes, nearly opposte ends! Saw any movies lately? 




 India. Where are you? 




 It's 10.40 AM here! 




 I am fine. too :) What's the time there? 




 Tom's Hardware's Android 5.1 performance test apperars to be surprising, as I found the real-life performace of 5.1 much better than 5.0. It's silky smooth with no frame-rate drops.   




 Hi! How are you? 




 I think it might be either Tintin or Baymax for me! 




 Abki baar DuARTe sarkar.

Damn, he's... DuARTe.

 Nope. My vacations ate going on, so I am not procrastinating anything :) 









 /uj The AutoMod replies are getting really annoying now. 




 **HITLER IS AN APPROVED PROPHET!** 




 You should! 




 My favourite is running and cricket :) 




 Yup, or was pretty sad. The first 10 minutes of Up were sadder, though. 




 Which sport do you like the most? :) 




 I love Toy Story 3. It was an amazing movie. 




 Toy Story trilogy :) 




 You favourite movie? 




 Not a lot of rules, it has as many as a normal sport. What's the most popular sport in your country? 




 Playing Cricket is really fun, and it's the most popular game here in India. And, you should really watch HTTYD. It's one if my favourite movies
 




 #BuyANexus 




 I woke up a few hours ago, and now I would play cricket (heard about the game?) with my friends. Yesterday I saw How To Train Your Dragon 1   2, and both were really good movies. 




 Hi! How's your day going? 




 I don't really watch a lot of TV, so I don't have a favorite show :) 




 Besides code, I really don't know :P  




 Currently I just finished my 10 th grade, so I didn't really do anything yet to pursue the goals. I would love to be a coder! 




 I would like to see myself in a good university in five years... I hope I would be in a good university doing Computer Science. 




 I would love some random questions :) 




 Mmmm....   Probably just fooling around, troubling people :P 




 Toy Story (1,2   3). I just love them. 




 I would go for truth! 




 implying a Nexus 6 can be destroyed. 




 /u/Flexxkii has wonderfully done it. This is the best implementation of Naut 3 I've ever seen. 




 I almost cried during the first 10 minutes of Up. 




 As you have counted Toy Story, I would also like to count in Up. The first 10 minutes were too damn emotional.

 Seriously. AP has shown themselves to be the only Android news blog that takes itself seriously. They consistently produce new, useful, substantiated content. I don't see many other android journalists (or even other journalists in other fields) do as fantastic 
of a job as you guys do.


The APK teardowns, fantastic sources of information. Don't see others doing this. You don't just post "Oh boy i think this is happening rumor rumor rumor." You go through the code line by line to see what it could mean. That's dedication.
Every week, the "x apps of the week." Awesome! What a great way to find apps. Original reviews, insightful and honest opinions, I love it!


All other general news. Always original content. Rarely do I see recycled "this rumor happened" and "this is coming out" like I do from literally every other blog.


Getting to know Android x.x.x. Perfect. Probably my favorite recurring thing on any blog ever.
Basically, what I'm trying to say, is thank you so much for putting out actual content. Thank you for not trying to get pageviews from "hot" titles and "latest rumors!" Thank you for trying to get pageviews from writing solid articles and putting thought into almost every post.


Seriously, I love you guys. I hope you can tell from all the upvotes and how many of your stories hit the front page! But even still, I wanted to let you know how absolutely grateful I am (and we all are)! Stick around, and keep up the fantastic work! We don't take it for granted, even if it might seem like it sometimes!


**tl,dr; I LOVE YOU ANDROID POLICE! THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING! 3** 




 I seriously love these new shorts!

 'Cause I'm 16. 




 I like to drink water. 




 Only a few people hate it. It's actually very good, and that's the reason why it's the highest grossing animated movie. 









 I am getting super-excited for this one! 




 Also, how was the movie? Does it live up to the high expectations? 




 And using reddit is fun *is not fun.* 




 Buzz Lightyear? 




 It would be the monsoon season here, with rains, and that would make it gloomy :( 




 Summer's almost over here :( 




 I might rephrase the question. Why is he the biggest shill? 




 Why is /u/ladfrombrad literally Stalin? 




 My top comment is this:




I had put an AMA request for him on ACJ, I think he saw that...


Yup, pretty proud if it... 




 MKBHD. 




 Running, it always helps relieve stress. 




 Even I love animated movies and I am re-watching most of the animated movies I love! 




 I loved Tangled as well. The CGI is beautiful. 




 Monster's Inc. is very nice film. I just rewatched it yesterday. 




 The animation was perfect.  




 Up was a very touching movie... I loved it. 




 Yup. Wall-E is amazing. 




 Probably the most underrated Disney movie? 




 Yup, Tangled and Frozen were excellent as well, and Big Hero 6 is my all-time favourite. 




 16, M, No, No. 




 Also, when did I tell you I like Disney? I genuinely don't remember :) 
























 Not the OP, but Charizard :D 




 Why do such horrible things keep on happening? 




 Nope. Was the first day of class, went with my sister for admission. 




 Seriously. Never expected this. 




 xD 




 She just stared screaming "Get out!". I don't just know what happened. 




 No, an external coaching class... 




 Got pushed out of a chemistry classtoday in Pune when the teacher understood I was a Gujurati, with she screaming at the top of her voice, "You guys do business, don't come for academics." :( 




 /uj I hope /u/ladfrombrad you are not offended :) 




 Numix and Numix circle icon pack...  Numix is really nice. 




 Yes, I am Indian, and I watch Bollywood movies, but I found only some of them like Lagaan, 3 Idiots or PK to be great. I prefer Hollywood animated movies over anything. 




 Thanks! :D 




 Mmmmmm...... is... [this](http://imgur.com/4mvJeZS)... enough for a sample???  




 :'( 




 Ummmm.... I don't think so... 




 /uj I don't mean to replace Duarte with Pichai, but just a temporary fun experiment. 




 ladfrombrad = ~~shillfrombrad~~  


Stalinfrombrad. 




 I'm pretty sure it will, it has a 100% rating on RT as of yet! 




 The first ten minutes of Up were the most emotional moments in any animated movie. 




 Brave was okay-ish at best. Pixar hasn't really made an excellent film after TS3. 




 Well... the movie wasn't so popular in my country, so I had never heard of it. And as I was on an animated movie watching spree, I just stumbled across this one and was pleasantly surprised :) 




 I just saw it 2 days ago for the first time, and I am wishing I should have seen it earlier! 




 Yes, MU was great, but it wasn't up to Pixar's high standards. 




 I just love the Toy Story trilogy, I can never get enough of them. 




 Toy Story 3 is my favourite film ever, but Up was mind-blowing as well, and definitely one of my favourites. Inside Out looks very promising, and it looks like Pixar might finally be back on track. 




 Yup, Pixar's Toy Story trilogy, Finding Nemo, the Incredibles, Wall-E, Monsters, Inc. and A Bug's Life were amazing. Here's hoping the same for Inside Out! 




 I rewatched Wreck-It Ralph today, and it's really an amazing film. 




 The Toy Story trilogy. Even I am on an anmated movies watcing spree, and I have watched tons of them in the last few days.  









 Yes, enjoying last few moments of freedom! 




 Last day of vacations, just enjoying it :)

 I've never seen any LoTR movie... :( 




 It's a really good film, especially if you like Pooh. You should definitely watch it. I am currently watching a lot of Disney and Pixar films. 




 Winnie the Pooh (2011) :P It was a great film, though. 




 It's 1.30 am here, and the only things that I did today were cycling and watching a movie.

 Hey, what's up? 




 10 AM here in India, and it's very sunny. 




 No Netflix in my country :( 




 Yes, Cars 1 wasn't good. The story was not sensible. 




 Blue inked! 




 I liked MU a lot, too, but it wasn't up to Pixar's standards
 Brave was an okay-ish kind of film. Cars 2 on the other hand... 




 Let's hope it would be good, there really hasn't been a good Pixar movie since Toy Story 3. 




 Here's the good dinosaur trailer, if you are interested :) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1nfAxkpx9M 




 But I'm didn't really like the trailer of The Good Dinosaur. The dinosaurs look too goofy... 




 Adding the founder of iVerge to the list of Approved Prophets? **NEVER!** 




 Also, Finding Dory might ruin Finding Nemo, too. Inside Out looks very promising, though. 




 I think You are right. I am not really sure about it, let's hope Cars 3 comes after it! Also, they should scrap their plans of making Toy Story 4. The trilogy is almost perfect, they might ruin it with this one... 




 Cars 3 is coming before it :'( 




 It was 2017, but then delayed :( I am desperately waiting for The Incredibles 2, though :) 




 But the third is coming in 2018 :( 




 Even I did a back to back watch! It's amongst my favourite movies now! 




 The whole two new apps would be coming Soon  




 I watched How to Train Your Dragon 2 yesterday :)

 Which games did you buy? 




 Heavy rains here... The only thing that I did today was atching a movie. How was your day? 




 3.44pm here... 




 What's the time at your place? 




 Yes, it looks amazing! Finally a good Pixar film after 5 years. 




 inside Out is releasing on the 26th in my country :( I am definitely going to see it, though! 




 I am very excited for Finding Dory, too! 




 I love Finding Nemo, too. It's just amazing. 




 My favourite would always be Toy Story 3, for the nostalgia. I've never seen The Road to El Dorado, though... 




 Yes, they did announce Incredibles 2, and I am super-excited for it! I am a huge fan of animated movies, and also a big fan of Pixar movies. Which is your favourite animated movie? 




 It's my favourite Science Fiction movie. I am also going to rewatch The Incredibles today. 




 I watched Wall-E today after many years. I love that movie. 




 The Heads-up notifications in Android 5.0 were a complete mess, and I hated them. The implementation in 5.1 is much better.  




 It's releasing on the 26 in my country :( Can't wait for it! 




 Which distro are you using? 




 Petition to add DuARTe's daughters to the list of Approved Daughters. 




 Yes, the JP callbacks were good... 




 I saw JW, but I personally thought that JP1 was much better. I am a lot more excited for Inside Out.

 "I go." One of the most emotional scenes in the movie. 




 Even I still have kept my toys in the bedroom. They were a big part of my childhood, and mean a lot to me. And after watching TS3, I don't have the heart to throw them away. 




 The ending is just amazing, always gets me. 




 Toy Story 3 and Up. Also, The Iron Giant. 









 I started to read Redwall by Brian Jacques. 




 One of the best comments!

This is not /r/AndroidMasterCard! 




 You need to see JP1. It's incredible! 




 I saw it in 3d. I found the movie to be okay. Jurassic Park was better, IMO.

 Time for our beloved AutoMod to reach there. 




 This one's only the second flair I've ever had, so I've never had a witty flair. 




 I didn't really like the trailer of the good dinosaur, though. 




 But I heard the movie was about Finding Dory's roots, her parents and finding about her childhood... At least that's what I heard... Incredibles2 could be great as well. 




 Inside Out looks amazing, but it's releasing one week late in my country, on 26th :'(



Also, the script of Finding Dory looks good, too... 




 *cough cough* Cars 2 *cough cough*



I am super-excited for Inside Out, though. 




 Even the ending of TS3 was very emotional. 




 The first 10 minutes of the movie were too damn emotional. 




 Yup. I love the movie. I love almost all of Pixar's movies.
