 Yeah, a little. Like holding pennies in your mouth. 




 First, the whole Betsy Ross thing...probably false. She didn't design the flag, and certainly didn't sew it in front of the fire at the old home place. (She did sew Navy flags, and she may have had some business is manufacturing flags, but their is no evidece of this, other than anecdotal.)

The first "American" flag was probably the Continental Colours, which flew over Washington's Boston headquaters in the early years of the Revolutionary War. (This version of the flag was the first to be "recognized" as the flag of the United Colonies when on November 16, 1776, the American warship, Andrew Doria, saluted a Dutch fort in the West Indies and was saluted in return. 

The first official national flag, also known as the Stars and Stripes, was approved by the Continental Congress on June 14, 1777.

After Vermont and Kentucky were admitted to the Union, two more stripes and two more stars were added to the flag. This is the "Star spangled banner" that Francis Scott Key saw that inspired him to write the song.

In 1818, after five more states had gained admittance, Congress passed legislation fixing the number of stripes at 13 and requiring that the number of stars equal the number of states.

By law, adding PR as a state will require an additional star to the US flag. [Here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States#Future_of_the_flag) are a few of the possible designs for a 51 star flag. (Also a good wiki article on the US flag.)


 




 No, but I once used her period for a bloody mary. (Salty, but somehow okay.) 




 You didn't let him in on the pregnancy, and you didn't want his input on your abortion...telling him now will result in either a "WTF? Who are you again?" moment, or a great deal of emotional distress. Leave it be. 




 Hmmm. I need one of these. To teach my dog how to do something. You know, something.  




 I'm glad you circled it...I was so amazed by the 500% return on penny stocks that I totally didn't notice the FRACKIN' DEMON BABY WITH FOUR EYES!! 




 New Smyrna is Volusia Co. 




 Currently ambivilent, but if I found out that any of our local ptp courses were slowing down course development, I would change my mind quicklike.

We've got a nice blend here on the East Coast of Florida...most local courses are freebies (Daytona Beach area). Inland, we've got Bill Frederick's Park...not a traditional ptp, but you have to pay to get in the park, so...it is. But in trade you get two extremely well taken care of courses, an on-site pro shop, plus the park itself is outstanding. (You talk about undesireables...BF Park does keep out the undesireables...no homeless, no school skippin' kids...not a bad trade for the five bucks or less it costs to get in!)

Nearby we also have an Executive DGC. It's true PTP, around 10 bucks if I remember, but again, you get what you pay for. This course is attached to a ball golf course, so with pay you get access to the club house, the bar, you can rent golf carts, they have a beverage cart (BEER GIRL!!!) My only complaint about that course is the lack of improvements...it's still in its "Just opened" state...but still...BEER GIRL!!!. 




 Done. I hate facebook. 




 LyinRyan kinda looks like Anthony Hopkins' younger weirder brother. 




 I'm a big talker, and very opinionated, and suffered from coming off as an aggressive prick for a while. I learned to change. Here's what I did.

-First, tone of voice. There's an in-between being loud and confident and diffident and standoffish. Use a smooth voice, dampen your inflection, ask more questions, and keep your sentences and your point short. Don't interrupt. And listen, and show that you're listening by making eye contact, and nodding where appropriate.

-Second, correcting someone is one of the hardest things to do without seeming like a total ass. I learned to tell when I needed to correct someone, and when I just wanted to. The best way to not come off as a dick when correcting people, is to stop doing it when it's just not that important.

Third, and most important, is body language. Watch what you do with your hands, don't make aggressive movements. Keep your stance open, be aware of what faces that you're making. When you can learn to control the message your body sends, it becomes easy to become an entertaining master of information and knowledge, without people hating you for being smarter than them. 




 Sister Hazel - All for you...in my ass. 




 Is that a cow, or Fozzie the Bear? 




 Let me tell you why you're not:

You're in college right now. You've picked a major, and still find time to be active in sports. Even with that dense schedule, you're maintaining a GPA of almost 3.0. You're so motivated in your physical fitness that you sometimes overextend yourself and make yourself late. Even then, you make time to get to your class, and then when your prof gives you hell for being late, you have enough pride in yourself, even in a class you don't care about, to feel bad for not meeting basic expectations. You're some combination of lucky/skilled/smart enough to have your tuition paid for, along with some living expenses. You have parents that are willing and able to help you with rooming expenses, and prideful enough to feel bad about needing their help. You have tried to lessen their financial burden by taking in roommates when you could. You are going to graduate college soon, and hope to apply to the California Teaching Credential Program. You look forward to having some time to go to work for yourself, and to spend some of your own money to further lessen the burden on your parents (who, by the way, know enough to not let you burden yourself with a student loan, which will follow you for half of forever). Anyways, long story short, you wish that you could be a little more self reliant, and wish that you could show your parents just a little bit more success in return for their investment, and recognize how lucky you are when there are so many around you that don't have it quite so well.

So. First, tell you parents thank you. Heartfelt. Let them know how much their help means to you.

Second, Step up your game just a bit. From what you've said here, you're doing better than a lot of the kids I went to college with.

Third, if you really feel bad about other students not having the tools to succeed, try some volunteer work, change what little bit of the world that you can change, and take joy in that change.

tl;dr Man the fuck up, do a good job, and call your mom. 




 Nah, the world has enough whiny bass players. 




 Practice, practice, practice.

Pick a song that you know really well on guitar. Make it easy on yourself, and go with something not hard. Four chords and a chorus, you know. And just practice it, over and over again.

The biggest thing is to train yourself to not quit when you flub. Keep going, play the whole song. Eventually, you will become accustomed to doing both at the same time, and it will become easier for you, but you will have to continue practicing, forever. 




 Run Ronnie Run is retarded funny. David Cross/Bob Odenkirk and the gang from Mr. Show. Too. Freakin'. Funny.  

Though Mandy's bit is just a cameo, but it sums up the plot of the movie fairly well.

 Greetings from the NSB!

Are you familiar with the story of the Tampa Monkey? (Monkey on the loose in the Tampa area for a couple of years now...making WC look a little silly in their attempts to catch). 

And better question...how do we learn to live with our animal neighbors? How many of these animals are actually dangerous and how many are being removed for just being a nuisance? 




 Powder up! 

I'm a Florida flinger, so I know something about hotballrash. First, keep 'em dry. Starts out of the shower...don't put your britches on wet balls. Dry 'em first.

Powder up! Especially if you're wearing drawers that rub that upper-thigh area. Bring some powder with you, and address as necessary. And remember...Talcum before it hurts, cornstarch after it's too late! And stay away from that medicinal Gold Bond shit...it's like thousands of angry ice-elves prospecting for gold on your sack. Terrible.

Drawer choice. Believe it or not, throwing down here in the heat, and the humidity, I wear board shorts...with those crazy net underwear sown in...and I never have the sackrash. Never. Might try it out, it's a little uncomfortable for the distance you'll be walking, but that shit keeps the old meat and two veg nice and airy...and airy means dry...and dry balls are happy balls. 




 There are plenty of recipes out there that you can search up, and I'm sure someone will come along and help you, but let me tell you what I do when I'm heavy a bunch of seasonal fruit.

Make flavored simple syrups. 1 cup of fruit, smashed, pitted, and peeled, 3/4 cup of sugar, 1/3 or so cup of water. Cook. Strain. Store cold. Lasts for a couple of weeks. Use it in fruit drinks, cocktails, dessert recipes. If you have a ridiculous amount, put some in ice trays, cover with plastic wrap, and store in the freezer. Use in recipes as needed.

Also, make and freeze mashed fruit. Store in icetrays as above. Throw in fruit recipes.

Happy baking! 




 Puckered-Ass-Conservative?

 




 Well, he seems pretty angry, and willing to disregard the positive aspects of the United States, but if you rewrote what he said in a way that he didn't seem like he was foaming at the mouth, a lot of what he said would ring true. We Americans, on the whole, are terribly mis- and uninformed about our country and its policies.

The major difference that I have with the poster is that I still believe that America can change...but I have to admit that I am losing hope. 




 Light is different when there is no atmosphere. Both Earth and Mars have one. The conspiracy that the moon landing was faked has been debunked enough times already.  




 I'm Mitt Romney, and I approve this message. 




 I just recently read the wiki article about EHS. I had no idea what to call what was happening in my head. I haven't had any occurances in the past couple years...only thing that I've really done different was that I improved my overall diet (I'm getting older). The last event that I had, I truly thought that I was having a stroke or something. Most times single events last less than a second real time, but are hard to judge "feel-time", but the last one went on for more than that. Very scary. 




 Have you been officially diagnosed, or is this a self-diagnosis? And how often are these "attacks" happening to you?  




 Pooping boob-dicks? Meh. But thanks for the new screen name for my next throw away. 




 I love the Gipsy Kings. Turned on to them from their cover of Hotel California featured on the Big Lebowski soundtrack.
 




 Yoga pants. Oh, and long socks. Freakin' love em. 




 Is that really that bad? I take my boy out of school on occasion...sometimes for cool sciencey things like the (RIP) shuttle launches, sometimes just to spend some time together.

Then I saw that they were from Live Oak. If that means FL, then never mind, bunch o' inbred meat necks up there. 




 I would have sworn the answer was going to be "Potato!"

 If she's well-read, she'll know the book, and approve it for you. Tell her one of your parent's recommended it. 




 Alas, Babylon.

There was a movie made of it, but it's so obscure and terrible that I think you can dodge that one.

It's got adventure. It's a captivating read. And fascinating, when taken in the context of it being written in the 1950's. (1959)

I won't ruin much of it, but it was written during the height of the cold war. Nuclear exchange was starting to be a daily concern between the US and the USSR. The story basically concerns a group of survivors, and the run up to a thermonuclear weapon exchange between two superpowers. 

This book is technically classified as a YA (young adult) fiction, but I've read and re-read this book, and it stands up to be good at my (advanced) age.

Easy read for people that don't read recreationally, and for more intelligent people, it provides an insight into the fears that Americans were feeling during the cold war. Even if you don't do the report on it, pick it up and read it. It's good.

[Here's the Wiki page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alas,_Babylon)

 Absolutely! My SO would love one, and love feedback! In fact, I'm a terrible musician, so I know feedback really well! No, really, I want to help...PM on the way. 




 BBQ sauce, sub maple syrup for some of the brown sugar.

Glaze smoked sausages on the grill. (Works for just about any meat. Maple glazed chicken breasts are freaky good!)

Sub for honey in just about any recipe. 




 It was a long wait, say true.
 




 Yeah, of course, but there is no support for that, just acknowledgment of the power of 19. 

The bigger issue for me is the rushed feeling of the ending...that nothing was fleshed out; like King woke up one morning and said to himself "OHHH! He'll just have to go through it again! I can finally end this thing!" 




 I hear you on Mordred: The whole last half of the final book felt rushed to me. It might be the way that I read the series. In order, as they were released. Yes, I waited the decade+ to find out what happened with Blaine.

King talks about how this story insisted itself, addressing it both in the fiction, and in many speaking engagements and TV shows he's done. You can almost tell that the end of the last book is done like yanking a splinter out: you've done all the work, got everything ready, and the only thing left is the one hard yank to get the fucker out. That's what the last book feels like to me.

More specifically, and I may be in the minority here, but I hated the ending. I get it, I get it, he had the horn the second time, there's a chance for redemption, but it doesn't address *why* he has the horn this time, how many times this has happened, and along with feeling rushed, it also feels like cheating. "Ka is a wheel, motherfuckers...HA!"
 




 LPT: Go to the hospital when you get salmonella. 




 At that point, I really didn't know that others existed...lol. Also, great course. Tom Brown park in Tallahassee. Look it up on dgcoursereview.com. Only a few pics up, but such a great place to play.
 




 I played just one course for about ten of those. Moved, found more courses. Adding two more this upcoming week when I go on vacation.

 Fifteen years, five different courses, no aces. I feel your pain.

The closest I ever came was the one and only time that I ever played by myself. At the very least my wife comes with me. Short hole, trees to the right, about 141 feet. Beautiful slight S curve and bumps the chains on the way by.

The only thing that I could think was that if I did ace it, who would I tell? There was no one there. Sure, my friends would believe me, but if a disc aces in the park and there's no one there to witness it, did it really *really* happen? 




 FOH restaurant manager here.

Get an order book and pen. Use them as props when talking to people and not ordering. (Also a great place to put crib notes about daily specials, drink ingredients, prices, etc.)

Never cross your arms or put your hands in your pocket. Never itch. Never touch your face. If the book thing doesn't work for you, cross your hands behind your back.

Got trouble with eye contact? Look at the end of their nose, or their eyebrows. More comfortable for you, barely noticable for them.

Read up on body language...much of what you do tableside is being picked up subconciously by your customers. Confident servers make more money. If you can't be confident, you must learn to fake confidence.

Take care of your hands. Make sure they are clean. Pay attention to your fingernails. Don't wear flashy jewelry, or clanky bracelets. If you have to have a band-aid on, make sure it stays clean, and is either very un-noticeable, or over the top goofy (like disney characters or camo or something) to make it a conversation piece.

Smile, unless your teeth are in bad shape. In that case, grin.

Be aware of your tone when talking to customers. Assume the role of butler. Always say "Yes" never say "Ya". Don't call a group of two women "guys". 

Act like you like your job. Leave the stress in the wait station or the kitchen.

Never talk about money (outside of item prices) with a customer. Never tell them how broke you are. And never ever talk about restaurant politics to a customer.

Have fun! 




 I love the [Where's George](http://www.wheresgeorge.com/) currency tracking project...but I sorta thought I was the only one leaving creative bill notes...:( 




 Try [votesmart.org](http://votesmart.org/), also check out [this site for current congressional votes](http://congress.org/congressorg/dbq/issuesdbq/votesearch.dbq) and [this site for current Senatorial votes](http://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/legislative/a_three_sections_with_teasers/votes.htm).

The short answer is that it's not made easy for us to know what they are voting for...it's almost like they don't want us to know. Also, if you can find a special interest group that shares your beliefs and interests, visit their page often for info. Single issue sites like NORML.org for marijuana legislation, or Greenpeace for eco issues, etc. Also, I like to visit sites that I don't agree with, just to see what each side is watching or pushing. Lefty sides like moveon.org, and righty sites like The Heritage Foundation, at heritage.org. 




 Wow. Welcome to American politics.

First, don't believe anything that the candidates tell you. What they are doing this election cycle is nothing more than advertising, and it is just as false and misleading as product/service advertising is.

Second, there are way more than two candidates. Don't believe people when they say that when you vote for a third party candidate that you waste your vote; politicians only care about getting *your* vote (or the vote from the larger group of people that is representational of your beliefs/needs/goals/interests)...if they see that a third party candidate is getting some traction from the voters, they will find out why, craft a deliberately thought out opinion about those matters that drove people to that third candidate, and adopt those beliefs as there own as soon as possible.

Third. Do your research. See how the candidates have voted on issues in the past. Pay attention to how often the candidates change their core message for special interest groups. Google is your friend here...stay away from campaign sites and special interest sites, and try to follow the money whenever you can. Each candidate is deep in the pocket of somebody, try and find out who.

Fourth. Don't believe that any candidate wraps themselves in the ol' red white and blue because they are a patriot...most of them are in it for the money, or for the power, at least at the national level, and most of them owe favors to someone, or ones. When you vote for a candidate, you vote in the favors that he/she owes.

Fifth. Dig deeper. Go to your supervisor of elections site, and request a sample ballot. Each election you vote on many different issues. You may have local, state, or national judges to vote for. You may have local, state, or national laws to vote for. Don't get caught with your pants down. If you don't know about an issue, or a candidate, leave it blank...don't vote for the name you like, or the party you like, just beacuse you're uninformed. Best to leave it blank if you don't know.

Sixth. Go early on election day. Don't cause trouble, stand in line, be prepared to show ID, some states require multiple ID, understand what the rules are before you go. No protesting/stumping for candidates in the polling station. Be quiet, wait your turn, be a good citizen, get your sticker, and get the hell out of the way.

Seventh. It's important enough to say again. RESEARCH. Some can be done from sites you trust. If you go to r/politics, you're going to be bombared with Obamadramarama. If you go to conservative or xtian websites, you're going get the Romneyfication. 

MOST OF ALL...(all caps because this is really it) EVERYONE WHO TRIES TO TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT THE CANDIDATE IS PROBABLY MISINFORMED, AND BELIEVES THAT THEY PERSONALLY WILL BENEFIT FRON THEIR CANDIDATE BEING ELECTED. You should just keep that in mind.

Good luck, and your vote counts, particiapation is important, and the best advice that I would give you is to participate in your *local* elections...you have more access, the issues are smaller and easier to understand, and they hit you directly at home...small town politics are still alive and well in America, and not so corrupted with special interests and massive monetary donations, and you can actually talk to your candidates, look them in the eye, and ask them what are they going to do for you, to make your life better.

Do your best, and remember...this country was founded on people who didn't stick to the rules, decided to make their own, and if we hadn't have won our Revolutionary war, would have been considered terroists as opposed to heroes, and would have been put to death for treason.

tl;dr...I love my country, I just think that we should see other people. 




 ...aaaannnndd the corn lobby is fighting hard to get HFCS relabeled as "Corn Sugar". Soon after that you can guarantee that their argument will be "Corn sugar is just another natural sugar...you don't require nutrition labels to differeniate between beet sugars and cane sugars, why should corn sugars be any different?"

AND THEY WILL WIN. 




 I'm working on a gluten-free menu for the restaurant currently. Even the suppliers don't know what's in their products. It's a freakin' nightmare.
 




 Even that may be misleading. Products that contain *any amount* of real blueberries can lable their product "Made with real blueberries". What you won't realize is that by "blueberries" they literally mean that there were two blueberries in the entire batch, and the rest is colored and flavored gelatin or TVP, or some combination of the two. 




 Whilst smoking with some friends long ago, I had hit that point where I became part of the couch. I was too lazy to lean forward for the pass, so I stuck my shoe out to the dude handing it to me from a nearby chair. I had every intention of just bringing my foot closer to my hand, but apparently decided against it.

I flicked the toe of my shoe up, and that little smoky guy, about half way burned down, did a beautiful flip or forty-two through the air, and I just stuck out my hand, and caught it (just about) perfectly between my index and middle finger.

I was able to hit it, and then I enjoyed the stunned looks on my friends faces for a second or two before I completely lost it, running around the room, high-fiving, and exclaiming "DID YOU SEE THAT SHIT! ERMAGARD! THAT WAS SO FREAKIN' EPIC!!" 




 It's still hard to tell...the two biggest tells are the trumpet shape and the color. But the shape is shared by safflower...and the certification states that at some point someone went into that factory and saw what they thought was saffron...what's being produced there now could be a mix of true saffron and safflower, or something completely different. 




 Profit above all else...but most people don't see past the pictures on the front of the box. 

I've been working with the Anaphalaxis Network on getting together some alternative menus for our guests with food allergies, and the one thing that I've learned that stands out is that if you are trying to limit or eliminate one macroingredient from your diet, it's damn near impossible. Things are misleading, mislabled, recipes change and the packaging doesn't...these people don't care about their customers, they just care about dollars...just dollars. 




 I don't regularly work with saffron, but was exposed to it in culinary school...to be honest, I don't remember the taste, other than that it had one, and it was good. What I remember most is the way that the color steeped into warm water; slowly, like tea in slow motion, but with no agitation or stirring, just yellowyorangred slowly swirling out of that little fiber. It was pretty cool. 




 I'm sure that there is someway around it that makes what they do, if not legal, then not exactly illegal.

I work in the supervisory side of food service nowadays, but I have a fascination with all things food related, specifically labeling, nutrition, and general food safety. The amount of misinformation that is allowed when it comes to food and ingredient identification should be terrifying to anyone who cares about what they eat. 




 If you can't taste your saffron, it's probably safflower. I don't know much about Costco's brands, but much of what's on the market as saffron nowadays, isn't.

Check out [this article](http://www.couriermail.com.au/lifestyle/food-wine/cooks-see-red-over-fake-saffron/story-e6frer56-1225935122839) from two years ago about the influx of fake saffron into the industry. 




 Also, all of you who just read this, said "Nyan" in your best Japanese accent to find out if this works or not.

 Just tell him....most dudes love chicks that have fantastics about Haveing their butthold play/lick. 




 Step one: Insert penis somewhere tight, preferably moist.

Step two: Thrust.

Step three: Repeat as necessary.

Watch some porn, get some ideas, don't try anything to wacky, and let her take the lead if she will. Good luck, have fun. 




 Step one: Get a camera.

Step two: Take nakey nakey pics.

Step three: Post on r/gw

Step four: Include message..."I'll be glad to let you take more..."

Step five: Get over it, and enjoy the sweet sweet karma, and the attention from your bf. 




 ...and it was terrible. Except for Cap'n Lou Albano. He exuded awesome. 




 Quite a challenge if you don't want to spend money...lol. But a few pro tips from a Floridian that doesn't run his air very much.

Your house will be coolest in the morning. Capture that cool. Block windows with heavy drapes, keeps the sun out. Pay special attention to any windows that get direct sunlight. UV film or mirror film for your windows. If you have AC that's not working at optimum, check your filters, make sure your AC can breathe. To cool down one room, block the AC vents in other rooms by shutting them off, or sealing with plastic and duct tape. Block off any doors with hanging drapes as curtains. Invest in fans. Lots of them. If there is no breeze, don't open your windows. Maximize cross winds in your home. When wind is blowing from the east, open east and west facing windows. Long term, look into a window unit to assist your ailing AC until it can be repaired/replaced. 




 Who knew?
 




 I'm a self-appointed ambassador of disc golf in my little beach town; I tell anyone and everyone about the sport, and have got dozens of people involved in the sport. (Next goal, a local course!)

Some of the things that people say when I tell them that I play disc golf crack me up.

Had an older lady the other day ask me what the club looked like...

....the one we hit the "frisbee" with. 




 ....until I'm done with him. 




 Find a better guitarist. 




 Great idea, but I see how this could possibly backfire... 




 I love this man. Every thing he does just seems to ooze awesome. I wish he was coming closer to my home, but I'm calling the number, and letting him know that I will have booze and karaoke on the day that he's closest to me.

Though I do wonder if this is some sort of Bill prank? Gonna go around town laughing at all the people throwing parties with sheets out front of their house that say Bill Murry can crash here. 




 Looks interesting. We play Innova almost exclusively, just started checking out some of the other manufacturing companies. I've already got two kind disc golfers sending out discs for us, but I'll PM my addy for you, if you want to still send it...I'm no longer in dire need, though!  




 I've been furiously clicking away at the up button, but it will only let me orange it once. Trust us, we know how awesome he is...and hopefully we can find a way to reward him! 




 We actually looked at the Surge when we shopped for her Astra...only mistake that we made was the Astra at 171g was a little heavy for her, but she loved it. (More form than arm, you know.) I'll PM my address, if you can part with that Surge, and I don't think that she's thrown any of the other ones, but if you think that it would benefit a RHBH weak arm, send it on, and gracious appreciation will be yours! 




 In the spirit of the upcoming Arbitrary Day, I seek the help of my fellow Redditors and Discers. 

My wife and I took a couple of friends out to beautiful [Tuscawilla Disc Golf Course](http://www.dgcoursereview.com/course.php?id=98) to play a friendly round with a couple of our buddies.

You ever have that game where nothing really goes right? Or left? My wife had that game. And on the signature [hole #7](http://www.google.com/imgres?q=tuscawilla+disc+golf+hole+7 hl=en biw=1024 bih=616 tbm=isch tbnid=ZRm7d6vpuf3NeM: imgrefurl=http://discjag.blogspot.com/2009/07/tuscawilla-park-in-daytona-beach-fl.html docid=YgsrrwZ1FatbeM imgurl=http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_9MfYZehXfoI/SnIQEZEKecI/AAAAAAAAAOU/DNvOdVLAQXo/s400/tuscawilla_hole7_basket.jpg w=400 h=300 ei=Uz38T6aeFYWO8wSms-zcBg zoom=1 iact=hc vpx=282 vpy=114 dur=5281 hovh=194 hovw=259 tx=118 ty=117 sig=111693889434370404481 page=1 tbnh=131 tbnw=175 start=0 ndsp=15 ved=1t:429,r:6,s:0,i:91) my wife put not one, but both of her drivers in the lake. A rare pink pro Beast, and her favorite Millenium Astra.

This park will recover discs, I think, but it could be awhile, months even, before they turn up in the local seller's trailer. (She does have name and number on them.) This leaves my wife without drivers to play...and we play two to three times a week. 

So here's my problem...we're so broke lately we can't even pay attention...and I just don't know if I can free up the money to replace those discs. Maybe two weeks from now, I might be able to pick something up in a DX for her, but it will be a bit before I can get her some quality plastics again.

DG is such a great way for us to get out, and our kids love the time spent in the park, and it pains me to see my wife in such foul spirits after losing her two favorite discs, and not be able to do anything about it.

So here's my begging....if any of you have an extra driver laying around, something you're tired of seeing, or just a disc that you feel needs someone who will love it, learn with it, and try to keep it out of lakes, please PM me and let me know you can help.

I would be willing to reimburse shipping, but like I said before, we're way broke and it might be a minute, but I do pay my debts, or if you're interested in trade, my wife is quite the crafty one. (Here's some [bag tags](http://www.reddit.com/tb/vosw5) that we made for our little start up club.)....maybe we could work something out in trade? 

At the very least, thanks for taking the time to listen to the lament of amateurs who can't keep their discs out of the water...lol. (I've been in that lake a time or two as well, but on the edge...she sank **both** of them in the middle.)

Happy discing! 









 Yeah...joking about the pics, it seemed a reddit-y thing to say. 

Ceiling fan? Haven't tried that one...hmmm...plans for tonight have changed. 

I'm glad you're going to talk to her. My wife is a big fan of note writing, maybe that would be a good way to handle this touchy subject.

 




 You guys are close, go talk to her. Maybe she doesn't understand that not only is that gross and weird, but possibly unhealthy and dangerous.

You also said that she admired your toy, maybe she went out and bought the exact same one?

Either way, passive aggressive isn't going to work for this. Don't just lock it up or something, talk to her.

Oh, and pics, or it didn't happen? 




 It's a long running joke, because in a way, it's true.

But not inevitable. It comes from familiarity...and the male's desire to conquer as many different women as he can. (Show me the hottest chick on the planet, and I'll show you a dude who's tired of boning her.) There is no challenge, no chase, to having sex with the woman who shares your bed for ten years, twenty years, fifty years.

You can beat it, by staying creative, and making sure that you communicate about sex with your SO. The wife and I have been looking at each other's nakey nakeyness for over a decade, and she still turns me on...because she knows how to; because she knows me.

 




 The baby was fine, believe it or not, injured, but okay. I did hear that one old man passed away from injuries, but all the reports are still saying that no one died.

This was pretty big news in my part of FL. This happened about a half hour north from us, and just two weeks before, [Another Publix got hit by a small airplane](http://www.news-journalonline.com/news/local/west-volusia/2012/04/03/plane-hits-deland-publix.html), and that one is just a half hour west of us. Bad month for grocery stores. 




 That doesn't happen here in FL. The old zombies are all out driving around. I work in a touristy area of FL, really hip with the ancient wrinkly ones. In my town, the joke (it's only half a joke) is that you just don't take to the road around 7pm.

That's when happy hour ends, and the old drunk people drive back to their condos.

It's like a Nascar race in slow motion, but with more wrecks.

And people. And Publixes. Can't forget about the Publixes. 




 Not a waiting room...that's the entrance to a Publix supermarket in Palm Coast, FL.

We're known for our old ladies here in the FLA, and this was another one, who claimed that her accelerator "got stuck" and she couldn't stop as she plowed into the front doors of the joint.

Those people were hurt, but amazing enough, no one died.

 ....and Blingo was his name-o! 




 Answer 1: Learn how to come a lot, or become comfortable with other men involved.

Answer 2: My experience is that this is true. My SO and I don't keep score, but we break even. What's important is that it is fun and comfortable. Just make sure to show her how much you enjoy making her cum. 




 Well...that makes sense.  




 Awesome. Homemade and crafty stuff is the best!

And, just to note: pleasebemysanta, pleasebemysanta, pleasebemysanta, pleasebemysanta.. 




 What's black and blue, and doesn't like anal?



The nine year old in my trunk. 









 There are eight of us playing once a week at our local course. Two of us have lots of experience and know the game well, and the rest have just been introduced to the game and are at varying skill levels, from intermediate to noob. 

We want to introduce a little cash into the game. Here's where I need help. What sort of alternate games or scoring can we introduce to keep it fair for everyone?

We already have an ace fund (It's a short course, three holes less than 150') that rolls for the month. The first Thursday of the month we play a regular stroke game, with closest to pin taking the pot. Second Thursday, we play mixed draw doubles, winning team splits pot, and third Thursday we're thinking a handicapped tourney style. Help me out with one more type of disc golf game that doesn't favor the couple of exp players?

tl;dr I like words, don't judge me. 




 Is there a way that I can set a single cell, or range of cells, to multiply an entered value by x? I'm setting up an inventory sheet for a restaurant and I want to enter cases received, but need the number shown to represent a piece count.

Example: I receiced two cases of meat which contain 32 steaks each. I want the user to be able to enter the value "2" and return the value "64" to the same cell. 



















 Not looking for Me First and The Gimme Gimmes version, I need Whitney's. I keep finding [this tab](http://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/w/whitney_houston/where_do_broken_hearts_go_tab.htm) on all my go-to tab sites, but I don't even know what that means! Help me, you guys! 
























 So explain to me like I'm five, web_design. I think I have a great idea for a magazine style website. I've done my research, and I believe that there are a group of people out there that are under-represented on the internet, and I want to fill that gap.

Here's the problem.

I'm an idiot.

Not really, but I have no experience in this field, and not many people to talk to. So, before I go out into the development/hosting community with money in my hand, ready to be fleeced, I thought maybe you guys could answer some questions for me? Please?

WEB DESIGN:

I would like this website to contain articles, which I post monthly, and then archive. I would also like this website to have user generated content, like uploaded pics and videos, with commenting available. So...

* As someone with no experience in website design, is an off the shelf product like Dreamweaver or similar even something that I want to mess with?
* If not, what should I be looking for from my web designer? Is this something that an amateur could do, or am I heading for one of the bigger design firms?
* About what price range should I be expecting to pay for a design service?


WEB HOSTING:

I don't know much about this topic, and have got Google overload from trying to differentiate between all the companies out there. Obviously I want a host that is gonna give me good uptime, and they all claim to have great uptime. So...

* What's the difference from paying 9$ for one company and 23$ for another?
* When talking to the hosting company, is the website that I described above considered one site with many pages, or many sites?
* What about combo packages? I've seen several of the "brand name" companies offering design and hosting at one price? Good idea, or waste of time built specifically for suckers like me?
* Is hosting something that I should be looking for from my designer?

WEBSITE MAINTENANCE:

I want to be able to post articles on a regular basis. Probably four sections, each updated monthly. I want to allow user uploaded content and comments. Again assuming that I don't know anything about how a website works...

* Are things like posting articles, allowing uploaded content, removing comments/uploaded content, etc...something that I should fully expect to be able to do on my own, or is this something that I will have to have help in, either from my designer or host?
* What sort of other maintenance should I be expecting to do? 


ADVERTISING/REVENUE:

Sure, we all want to make money right? I'd like to have a little revenue coming in. 

* This website would be target-specific, so would something generic like Google Adsense work for this idea, or should I be contacting specific webmasters about advertising opportunities? 
* Would like to have the ability to sell items related to the website on the site (not the main focus of the project)...cart it up on the page, or link out to some Etsy or Ebay page?
* I understand that adding advertising on your site is just cutting and pasting code into your existing page...is this something that I can learn? How quickly, or how difficult for someone with little/no exp? Or is this something I have to have someone else do for me everytime I want to change ads on the site?

One more question about website registration...the name that I want is currently registered with GoDaddy, and not used. Expires in about six months. What happens after that expiration date? Is it open season on the domain name, and I can register it through my choice of domain registrys, or do I have to deal with the GoDaddy folks to try and capture that domain name?


You guys are awesome for even reading this far. I've gotten great help from Reddit in the past for all kinds of other issues, and I have no doubt that someone or ones out there can help me out a little bit. Ease my Google headache a little bit, and let me go into this sounding like I know what the hell I'm talking about.
 




 Because my original santa didn't send anything by the deadline or attempt to message me about sending it late, I was rematched. Right away I received several messages from my rematch santa, and soon after that my gift was marked as shipped. However, the same day my rematch shipped my gift, I received another gift by UPS. It was from Amazon and included a gift note saying *Merry Christmas from Reddit Secret Santa.* 

Now, I have confirmed with my rematch santa that these gifts are not from him, and the name on the gift note does not match my original santa's name (as confirmed by kickme444 through private messages). Also, my original santa hasn't marked anything as being shipped.

Santa, if you could come forward and reveal yourself that would sure help me out. I want to confirm this gift as received, however, if it isn't from my original santa, I don't want him/her getting credit for sending a gift they did not send. If it is from them, I don't want them getting banned for not sending a gift. 

It is a really great gift, and I want the sender to know that it is GREATLY appreciated! Please come forward, Santa. You can even message me privately if you want. Thanks!

 




 I learned this song in 04, and I don't remember it in D...does anybody know any different?
 














 My buddy and I are getting together a very casual acoustic duo. In addition to several originals, we're trying to get together some good two part guitar, two part vocal songs...and we just can't think of very many to check out. So, wanna help us out? We're both dudes, with a strong mid-range vocal, and decent alto vocal. Guitar skill is medium and advanced, respectively. We're willing to check anything out, and comments with youtube or tab links will be upprecciated! 









 In response to this [video post](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/lubn3/cockroach_in_your_ear_nsfl/), I responded with this:


This actually happened to me.

I was staying at a friends house, and woke up with an absolutely horrible *scrabbling* sensation in my ear. I don't remember too much about the next couple of minutes, but my friend tells me that she heard me fumbling about in the bathroom, and came in to find me standing at the sink, amongst a scattering of used qtips, a spilled bottle of hydrogen peroxide, and holding a pair of scissors.

I don't really know what I was going to do with the scissors.

The roach, a little german guy, had climbed down (or had been forced down by my mishandled ministrations) well into my ear canal, and had run into my ear drum.

I wish I could explain what that sounds like. I have been telling this story for over a decade, and I've never been able to accurately explain how *alien*; how perfectly horrible that sound is.

And it was loud.

The bug would be still for a period of time, and then would start moving, and I would fall to the ground, truly writhing on the ground.

The girl lived close to the hospital, and we walked up to the emergency room. It was about 3am at this point, and we had to go to this walk-up window, and explain what was happening before they would let us in.

As I was explaining what had happened to me, that little fucker started doing his laderhosen dance on my eardrum, and I fell to my knees at the window, cracking my chin a good one on the counter on the way down.

When I got back to my feet, the receptionist lady asked me (not kidding)...."Is it really *bugging* you that bad?"

When I find her, I will kill her.

After getting into the ER, the doc came in, and took a look in my ear with the scope thingy. He explained that they were going to have to remove it manually, with forceps.

It took two orderlies and a security guard to hold me down.

The doc stretched my earhole out with some sort of spreader, (that hurt a lot) and went in after the bug. The bug saw him coming, and didn't want anything to do with the shiny metal things coming after it, and tried to go the other way...

**Into my brain.**

The doc finally got hold of the bug, and there was this feeling of *pulling*, and the sound...this horrible *stretching* sound, though that really doesn't do it justice, as the bug fought to remain in the nice new warm home that it had found.

The doc removed the bug from my ear...

*In pieces.*

He didn't want out. At all.

Long story short (too late?), a fairly serious infection that required me to spend a bit of time in the hospital, some minor damage to my ear drum and ear canal, some long term hearing loss...I still am not at 100% in that ear, 90% maybe, but not perfect...and a whole lot of alcoholic counseling over the next couple of years to get over the whole event.

Perfect story for halloween, and every word true. I slept with earplugs for quite a few years afterward...I eventually got over it; no paranoia about bugs, though I don't like to talk about it, and haven't thought of it in years.

Thought reddit might be interested in my story; ask away.


 














 Not a lot like [Crichton's other work](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Crichton#Works), other than the fact that the book was well researched and well written, [Pirate Latitudes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_Latitudes) was discovered after Crichton's death. Wanna talk about this book? 










































































 It has come to our attention that the usage of *"Cutting the cheese"* as a euphemism for passing gas has declined sharply since the mid '80's. We are now involved in a program to have this phrase revitalized in the American lexicon. To aid in this effort, we have now declared that *"Gutting the fish"* will now be used as a lexicon for the vaginal queef.

Just please note that the following phrases are *still* acceptable when referring to the vaginal queef. (This list is **not** meant to be all-inclusive.)

* Panty Blaster
* Blowfish
* Vart, Varting
* Bi-labial fricative 
* Victoria's Secret

 I responded by saying that I was gonna call mine "Inception" because it leaves you confused, and glad that it's over. 





























 It seems to me from reading all these great posts in this sub, that us CC's essentially fall into two categories...

* Those of us that are tired of the cable monopolies, and are working to find a way to watch televised entertainment on our own terms, and...

* Those of us who have recognized that TV watching is an addiction, and have used cordcutting to control this aspect of our lives.

Where do you fall, and do we deserve two different classifications of cordcutter?

 This law was tested in front of the [Supreme Court](http://supreme.justia.com/us/377/402/case.html) in June of 1964, and found to be unconstitutional. 

This law was passed shortly after the [Monkey Trial](http://law.jrank.org/pages/2855/John-Thomas-Scopes-Trial-1925-Monkey-Trial-Darrow-Deflates-Bryan.html) where evolutionism was attacked. John Scopes was found to be guilty of violations of [The Butler Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler_Act), though John Scopes was not fined, and the courts eventually moved to find the Butler Act unconstitutional in 1967.  




 When my Grandmother died, she willed her property to me. My father was supposed to help out by monitoring the taxes on the land, and basically screwed us by not paying any of it.

Here's the quandry I'm having. My mother in law (a paralegal and "flipper") did some legwork and tells me the property is valued at $9600. (It's 2.4 acres in an undeveloped part of Northern Florida. It has a house on it, but the house is in serious disrepair.) She tells me that the total tax burden is $5400, and that if not paid by the end of the month, it will go to auction.

She offered me this deal. She would write the check for $5400 if I would put her on the deed. When I paid off the loan, she would switch the deed back to my name. Sounded a bit shady to me, and I know she's done some shady things, but she's never done me wrong.

I asked my wife to confirm these things for me, and she got on the horn with the tax office, and is told that we must make a payment of only $655 to pay off the back property taxes (Not paid since 2002) to prevent auction. She was also told that the total value of the property was $14500. The rest of the $5400 is "special assessment taxes" for 911 and such, that haven't ever been paid on the property, but that could be paid in installments.

My questions are...

Is my MIL trying to screw me? I don't know why she would lie to me...

Am I in danger of having the tax certs sold on that property if I don't pay the total tax burden of $5400?

Any help is appreciated. Thanks.

Edits: formatting

Edit: **UPDATE**  The MIL was not trying to help us, she was trying to screw us, I guess. We told her about the $655 being the only thing that I need to pay to keep the property, and she's been freaking out...cajoling us, yelling, harassing phone calls, and screaming fights, telling us the only way is her way, even in the face of contradictory evidence. The only question now is what can I do to get the money together by the end of the month...I've got about half of it, and I'm rolling nickels to try and get the rest of it together! Wish me luck. 



















 Let's discuss. Is this a good day in history that provided closure for the Vietnam era, or was this a cowardly move to forgive men not strong enough to fight?

 I was unlucky enough to have to drive 95 north to 10 west in florida on Sunday, the day after all the bowl games here in the great state of Florida, and while driving, a couple of things occured to me.

If you have those really cool blue headlights, you are an asshole. Yes everyone can see you coming, but that's all they can see. You are blinding everyone else.
High beams are for deserted country roads with no streetlights. Just because it gets a little misty in the evening in the Florida winter, doesn't mean you have to light the way like Jeebus himself.
The left lane is known as the fast lane or hammer lane or passing lane for a reason. If you are in that lane, and people are passing you on the left, you are in the wrong fucking lane. Get over.
If you approach a group of cars that are evenly spaced out, traveling safely, with the faster cars on the left, this is not an invitation for you to fulfill your nascar fantasies by zipping in and out of traffic. Slow the hell down, and join the flow.
When it rains, slow the hell down. Especially if you are sporting crappy tires in an old beater. I'm talking to you SUV I saw fishtailing its way towards (what I thought would be) certain death, around exit 303 on I10
Try to remember that your car is several thousand pounds of steel, while you (and myself and my family) are just simply several pounds of meat. Safety has come a long way, but meat will still lose to steel at high speeds.
And just a note to the SUV with GA tags, and all the Jeebus stickers. The way you were driving on 95 north made me think that you hoped Jeebus would see you safely to your destination. Whipping in and out of lanes, no blinkers; talking on the cellophone, kids in the back. I wished you good luck as you shot by, but I have to tell you, when I saw your SUV had gone off the shoulder and rolled, and all your possessions had been strewn across the highway for the world to see, I could not help but laugh my way to my destination. I was glad to see that you and your family were apparently unhurt, so maybe Jeebus was looking out for your car, but Karma was looking out for the rest of us.

Drive safe, redditors. Wherever you're going, don't be dying to get there.

 Let's get to work on this, reddit. 




 Instead I found [this](http://www.brunching.com/alanislyrics.html) and [this](http://www.song-lyrics-generator.org.uk/). 




 Cmon locals...who's going to the St auggie or NSB Beachside show? Any one going to Bear Creek this year? 




 Get a [taste](http://www.zachdeputy.com/) here if you are not yet familiar with his island-infused, drum n bass, gospel ninja soul music! See you there! 




 
So, I'm taking the kids down to the local library today, and while we're there, the wife and I are going to cast our votes for the midterm election. As an American citizen, this is a favorite day of mine...but this year, as a Florida resident, I have been subjected to the very worst that bipartisan politics has to offer. This has been the longest run up to an election that I think I've ever had to suffer, and I haven't seen mud slung like this since the last time I saw the girls wrestling at Bottom's Up. I know nothing about the candidates, other than the fact that if they were put in the same room, Tina Turner would magically appear, and people would start chanting "Two man enter, one man leaves!"

 

For the spot of governor this year we have a democrap and a republicliar. I don't know anything positive about either (R) Rick Scott or (D) Alex Sink. But I have heard that (D) Sink has had unprocteced gay sex with her unborn fetus before going and having it aborted by an illegal alien that she promised amnesty to. And I heard that (R) Scott was all for invading Mexico instead of putting up a wall, and all he needed to know about government he learned from the bible and 1984 by George Orwell. There were also some other people running who don't have enough money to be important.

 

The Senate race is not much better. The Derpocrats are offering us Kendrick "Aren't we progressive by nominating a black guy" Meek, and the Retardicans are offering us Marco "Cuba wasn't that bad" Rubio. These two have been overshadowed by the fight for Governator. After all the money that they spent, and all the ads that they both have run, the only thing that I know about these two with any certainty, is what they look like. They are as insubstantial as ghosts, only louder. Then you got Independent Charlie "Jesus H." Crist. This guy has been accused of flip flopping more than John Kerry ever was. Crist was a party Retardican, until the party line required him to set fire to the Gulf of Mexico so that rich fat white men could squeeze a little more blood out of the citizen turnips that they "represent" (They keep saying this word, but I do not think it means what they think it means...) Crist broke the party line, the Party pulled support, so Crist dumped the party so that he could represent the People's Will of Florida....and this apparently is a bad thing. Having morals will not be rewarded, there Charlie. There are also some othere people who did not have enough money to matter.

 

There are a few amendments to vote on, but none of them are Prop 19, so no one has seemed interested in them. In Florida we have amendments 5   6, which supposedly are supposed to bring some common sense law to congressional redistricting. The Democrat commercials that I've seen on this seem to explain what the amendment purports to do, and how it will affect Floridians. The Republican commercials that I've seen about this simply point out that the ACLU is run by the devil, and shows pictures of Obama and Pelosi, with their heads bent together, apparently continuing to plot for world domination.

 

And my other favorite...A non-binding referundum. I qoute:

"In order to to stop the uncontrolled growth of our National Debt and prevent excessive borrowing by the Federal Government, which threatens our economy and national security, should the United States Constitution be amended to require a balanced budget without raising taxes?"

 

Wow. Sounds good. Our family runs a balanced budget, so the government ought to be able to as well, right? But I also spend a lot of time and energy increasing the amount of income that I recieve. You do know how the government gets its income right? Taxes! I'm all for a smaller government, and I don't think that we need to be paying for illegal aliens to get health care, and for the state of Missouri to do a multi million dollar study to find out why crisp pickles are better than soggy ones, but I don't think that we need to have a constitutional amendment that prevents our government from recieving additional income. (I'm a fan of the fair tax, but no one's letting my vote on that, yet) I know that it's possible to have a balanced budget without borrowing (Clinton did it) but this feels like the same thing that is wrong with america at large. We want what we want, but no one wants to pay for it.

 


Ending on an important note...please get up and turn off your TV, do the research on-line about the candidates that you care about, and learn about the issues you get to vote on, and go on down to your polling place and cast your vote. Please. It's your job. It's your duty. And many Americans in the past had to die to get you that right. White folks had to fight in the beginning for their right to vote, and then change the law so that they didn't have to own property to be able to vote. You black folks couldn't vote until 1870, and in most parts of the country they made it so difficult for you that most of you couldn't vote until the Civil Rights era of the '60s and '70s. And you girlys out there...do you remember when you learned about the suffergettes? You've only been voting since 1920. Don't do your ancestors a disservice by forgetting the lessons that they paid so dearly for. See you in line, I'm gonna go vote. Whether it's for a douchebag or a shit sandwich is yet to be determined.

So, I'm taking the kids down to the local library today, and while we're there, the wife and I are going to cast our votes for the midterm election. As an American citizen, this is a favorite day of mine...but this year, as a Florida resident, I have been subjected to the very worst that bipartisan politics has to offer. This has been the longest run up to an election that I think I've ever had to suffer, and I haven't seen mud slung like this since the last time I saw the girls wrestling at Bottom's Up. I know nothing about the candidates, other than the fact that if they were put in the same room, Tina Turner would magically appear, and people would start chanting "Two man enter, one man leaves!"

 

For the spot of governor this year we have a democrap and a republicliar. I don't know anything positive about either (R) Rick Scott or (D) Alex Sink. But I have heard that (D) Sink has had unprocteced gay sex with her unborn fetus before going and having it aborted by an illegal alien that she promised amnesty to. And I heard that (R) Scott was all for invading Mexico instead of putting up a wall, and all he needed to know about government he learned from the bible and 1984 by George Orwell. There were also some other people running who don't have enough money to be important.

 

The Senate race is not much better. The Derpocrats are offering us Kendrick "Aren't we progressive by nominating a black guy" Meek, and the Retardicans are offering us Marco "Cuba wasn't that bad" Rubio. These two have been overshadowed by the fight for Governator. After all the money that they spent, and all the ads that they both have run, the only thing that I know about these two with any certainty, is what they look like. They are as insubstantial as ghosts, only louder. Then you got Independent Charlie "Jesus H." Crist. This guy has been accused of flip flopping more than John Kerry ever was. Crist was a party Retardican, until the party line required him to set fire to the Gulf of Mexico so that rich fat white men could squeeze a little more blood out of the citizen turnips that they "represent" (They keep saying this word, but I do not think it means what they think it means...) Crist broke the party line, the Party pulled support, so Crist dumped the party so that he could represent the People's Will of Florida....and this apparently is a bad thing. Having morals will not be rewarded, there Charlie. There are also some othere people who did not have enough money to matter.

 

There are a few amendments to vote on, but none of them are Prop 19, so no one has seemed interested in them. In Florida we have amendments 5   6, which supposedly are supposed to bring some common sense law to congressional redistricting. The Democrat commercials that I've seen on this seem to explain what the amendment purports to do, and how it will affect Floridians. The Republican commercials that I've seen about this simply point out that the ACLU is run by the devil, and shows pictures of Obama and Pelosi, with their heads bent together, apparently continuing to plot for world domination.

 

And my other favorite...A non-binding referundum. I qoute:

"In order to to stop the uncontrolled growth of our National Debt and prevent excessive borrowing by the Federal Government, which threatens our economy and national security, should the United States Constitution be amended to require a balanced budget without raising taxes?"

 

Wow. Sounds good. Our family runs a balanced budget, so the government ought to be able to as well, right? But I also spend a lot of time and energy increasing the amount of income that I recieve. You do know how the government gets its income right? Taxes! I'm all for a smaller government, and I don't think that we need to be paying for illegal aliens to get health care, and for the state of Missouri to do a multi million dollar study to find out why crisp pickles are better than soggy ones, but I don't think that we need to have a constitutional amendment that prevents our government from recieving additional income. (I'm a fan of the fair tax, but no one's letting my vote on that, yet) I know that it's possible to have a balanced budget without borrowing (Clinton did it) but this feels like the same thing that is wrong with america at large. We want what we want, but no one wants to pay for it.

 


Ending on an important note...please get up and turn off your TV, do the research on-line about the candidates that you care about, and learn about the issues you get to vote on, and go on down to your polling place and cast your vote. Please. It's your job. It's your duty. And many Americans in the past had to die to get you that right. White folks had to fight in the beginning for their right to vote, and then change the law so that they didn't have to own property to be able to vote. You black folks couldn't vote until 1870, and in most parts of the country they made it so difficult for you that most of you couldn't vote until the Civil Rights era of the '60s and '70s. And you girlys out there...do you remember when you learned about the suffergettes? You've only been voting since 1920. Don't do your ancestors a disservice by forgetting the lessons that they paid so dearly for. See you in line, I'm gonna go vote. Whether it's for a douchebag or a shit sandwich is yet to be determined.

 I know there are locals in this tourist heavy town. Let's not be overshadowed by r/orlando anymore! 









 I am contemplating leaving my steady job with the goal of total entertainment domination of the area in which I live. Karaoke, event DJ, live sound production/recording, and gigging as a one man band...any tips or warnings from those of you making a living in the industry? 









 Condensation will collect on a surface when it is colder than the air around it, correct? Trying to build a small(ish) collector with an output of around 1/2 oz per hour. Could I use a metal bowl shape to heat up a volume of air using solar heat so that condensation would collect on a small metal plate that is shaded by the bowl? Any ideas/help?  




 I'll post for a bit tonight, and then tomorrow afternoon when I come out of my anesthetic fog... 




 I've had this broke-ass tooth for six years, and I'm finally manning up and getting it taken care of. I'll answer questions about my monday-morning-molar-meltdown tonight, and then Monday afternoon when I am able to. 














 [Here's](http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2010/07/28/a-poignant-way-to-mark-911/) the story from The Independent. 

The Dove World Outreach Center? Really? What sort of outreach is this? 

Here's the [facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/pages/International-Burn-A-Koran-Day/134718123226530?v=wall) of this wonderful event. My wife and I were thinking about going....anyone know where we can get a whole lot of bibles for really cheap? (Any other FL Redditors thinking about going?)

If you don't go, you could still drop a comment at the anti quran burning [facebook page here](http://www.facebook.com/pages/In-Protest-of-International-Burn-a-Koran-Day/105895039464821?ref=ts)

See ya there! 









 Happy 100, [Jacques Cousteau!](http://www.cousteau.org/) Anyone want to guess what Jacques would have had to say about our Gulf of Mexico? 









 Heard he had a different stroke. 




 Or do I need a new hobby?

[Soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com/smokin-joe-ledden/tracks) 




 I reworked this recording today. It's an [old song](http://soundcloud.com/smokin-joe-ledden/circles), but I like the vocals. 
 




 My wife and I have a very good mexican friend who lives a few hours away (in the US). We don't get to see or talk to them often. When we decided that we were getting married, we called him and told him that we needed an address to send him an invitation. His response was that he was "not aware that he needed one" and then contact has broken off. Have my wife and I mistakenly broken some sort of taboo? Never had any issue like this with him before, and he didn't come to the wedding, invitation or not. 

Can you help? And, if we have done something taboo, how do we apologize?

(edit:grammar) 




 I record in Cubase3...have no problem converting cubase's .cpr files into .wav files. Can't find a converter to take .wav into .mp3 without adding pop/clicks or just generally sounding like hell...any ideas? 









 Where are some good sites for hosting/posting music? How do I get people listening from here. I have only a small library of original music right now, but I am recording often, and I don't know what to do with all my hard work. Any suggestions?

 1. Good advice, as 1 out of every 50 eggs will be ...weird. Extra yolk, fertilized, or just generally gross. I break them singly into a plastic egg cup before I toss it in the pan/baking mix.

2. If you're having this big of a problem with egg shell, you're cracking your eggs too hard. Just tap them on the side with the back end of a knife, use both hands (pro level one handed!) to pull the shells apart...usually no fragments. 




 Excellent suggestions! Thanks so much. I definitely use outside storage, though that fried in my electrical explosion event too. This think looks lag free and powerful! Thanks again! 




 Over time,  I have learned to like the ending, but upon first read, it just pissed me off...it felt cheap, too easy...re-reading and reading again, and I feel a little bit better for it, but when I read those words, those oh so familiar words, after all this time....*sigh. 




 Most of my recording paths are "live" (for lack of a better description), basically an outboard sound source - outboard preamp - outboard effects - into the DAW. What plugins and VSTs that I do use are instrument modelers for my MIDI controller...and not big combo packs (like Komplete programs with over 250 instruments emulators, I look for downloads of single sounds, or just a few options for a single sound, depending on my needs... I know you need me to be more specific, but the reason that I'm attempting this build is that I had a major electrical fuckaroo caused by an act of drunk people driving into power pole...fried my studio, and most everything connected to it....including a very high end APC surge protector...with the insurance nightmare, it's been months (almost a year) since I've been able to use the studio, so it's difficult to remember all the VSTs and plugins that I have used in the past.) I will say again that VSTs and plugins are minor compared to the "live" aspect of my recording. (I know that Cubase is built for beatmasters and electronica, but it has features that work for me as a live recorder.)

As far as tracks, most songs would have five or six stereo tracks (the way I record/mix that means 10-12 single tracks) effects tracks for each of those, and maybe 3-5 digital/midi tracks, with effects tracks for each of those...so 35 tracks max, and that would be a very "busy" piece for me.

The only other pertinent thing I would add is I would like to have the ability to use a dual monitor system...my last studio did not, but I think that would make my life a little easier; having both the ability to split screens so that the DAW is on one screen, and effects/emulators/MIDI can run on the other, and to mirror, so when I'm working with other musicians we can both see the same DAW while working in different area of my studio corner. (And, I'm not much for overclocking or anything, my DAC provides external clocking anyway, pretty sure.)

Sorry so wordy, and I appreciate whatever advice is coming my way! 




 None. Digital Audio converter will run on USB 2.0. Mic/instrument/midi will run through DA converter. 




 Read on. You will be given an opportunity to stop early. Many of us wish we had. But you won't. And King will call you out for your decision... "You are the grim, goal-oriented ones who will not believe the joy is the journey rather than the destination...who still get the lovemaking confused with the paltry squirt that comes to end the lovemaking." You will read to the end, oh yes, and you will see...yes, you will see. You will finally see.

The next time you read it, stop there. It's better that way. 




 I would like to, but my previous PC did not...latency was noticeable in some heavy application sound paths.  




 I need to replace my digital audio workstation! Thinking about a combo machine that I could also use for general video editing (no software chosen, youtube quality stuff) and photoshop applications. DAW running Cubase 5, (maybe upgrading) along with several other virtual sound editors/effects/modulators/emulators. Lag is a killer in sound recording, of course, so let's avoid that. Budget on the low end, let's try to keep it under a grand? I can source OS and peripherals elsewhere.  




 Self-explanatory.
 




 I tried everything...the only thing that worked for me was patience, and trying to be understanding and not filled with self hate when I failed, which I did, over and over and over and over again. But each time I failed, I would let them grow a little bit farther. I still don't know if I've succeeded, I just haven't bit my nails in quite a while, I may still bite them in the future. But if I do, I'll move on, start over, and be patient. I will win. 




 Same problem here. I just quit biting my nails recently, (three year process, not biting for months now) and it seems to have gotten worse. Inside of my cheeks are beat to hell. 




 That was badass. I think the commentators will be washing their underwear and extra time or two...they really seemed to enjoy that. 




 Lick your lips, moan, look him deeply in the eyes, grunt and say..

"I'm gonna be pickin' your ball hair outta my teeth for *days*!"

Try to be sexy when you do, it helps.
 




 I do it all the time.

I'm up to one orgasm. Then I take a nap for 56 minutes.
 




 Didn't really get that either. I thought perhaps she's mad at the way Glen's been acting about the whole thing, but if she was mad about Glen being super mad, why get super mad at Glen?

Still don't understand women, even when fictionalized. *sigh. 




 Two methods here. As mentioned, the menu puts profit above all else...the items that are described the best, or boxed out, or "featured" or some such, are the items that the restaurant makes the most profit on. These are not necessarily the best items, just the ones that make the most money. Quick menu rule of thumb...if you want good food, order what the restaurant specializes in. Eating in a steakhouse, order steak. Pizza joint? Stay away from the sandwiches. Don't order chicken at a seafood joint. Other method is to chat up your server. They may suggest items with a high markup to try and pad their tip, but engage them, and ask them what do they eat when they get off work. Tip accordingly for awesome suggestions. 




 Lucifer's Hammer - Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle (sp?)... the book that turned me on to reading oh so long ago. Great epic end of the world shit right here man. 




 This is a good idea. There is a disconnect in expectations as most men are waiting to meet their insatiable whore while most women are waiting to meet their Prince Charming...or, women need to watch more porn, and men need to watch more Disney.

Or Disney Porn. Just sayin'. 




 One time my future wife and I were hanging out with some friends at our local bar. I was yuckin' it up, being the life of the party (my thing) and the future wifey-poo says something-or-other while I was talking to some friends, so I face-palmed her, and (loudly) said...

 "SHUUUUSH! Grownups talking!

We are still together, married for three years, believe it or not, though she does tell me (too often) that that was the closest she's ever been to slapping the dogshit outta me. Even though I got a great laugh out of that line, in the end, not worth it, wouldn't recommend it...

 




 "Oh, you were *in* the Holocaust? Well at least you weren't raped in the Holocaust." 




 130 pounds of prime rib, about 45 filets of tenderloin, a couple of porterhouse steaks, about 50 top sirloin steaks, about 30 ribeyes, 250 baked potatoes, four pounds of creamed spinach, about two gallons of rice, 20 filets of salmon, 20 filets of swordfish, two pounds of shrimp, 40 racks of babyback ribs, and 40 chicken breasts. (I had to work, had leftover ribs with the wife when I got home around midnight. Happy Valentine's Day!) 




 I call mine the Rubik's Cube....because it gets harder the more you play with it. 




 So much of our reality is based on that fiction. 




 A smile.


Seriously. Whether it's sexy short skirts, or a long skirt and no undies, or sweat pants and tank top like Panda said, the most important thing is confidence and fun.

For me, just the smile, when we get home, please. I don't need anything else. 




 Lol....true, it has been said that you can turn to any random page of the bible and find relevance. The bible is full of death, so really no surprise that that is mentioned often, but it was neat to see how many chapter 2, verses 17 had something in common. (I researched chapters 21 verses 7 and didn't see as many commonalities.) Just a statistical blip, but it was fun researching it. (An atheist's best weapon is biblical knowledge, you know!) 




 Hmmm....

So I hated life, because the work that is done under the sun was grievous to me. All of it is meaningless, a chasing after the wind. Ecclesiastes 2:17

The LORD has done what he planned; he has fulfilled his word, which he decreed long ago. He has overthrown you without pity, he has let the enemy gloat over you, he has exalted the horn of your foes. Lamentations 2:17

Let the priests, who minister before the LORD, weep between the temple porch and the altar. Let them say, "Spare your people, O LORD. Do not make your inheritance an object of scorn, a byword among the nations. Why should they say among the peoples, 'Where is their God?' "  Joel 2:17

The arrogance of man will be brought low and the pride of men humbled; the LORD alone will be exalted in that day,  Isaiah 2:17

Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether. Song of Solomon 2:17

And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams  Acts 2:17

Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone. James 2 2:17

And the world and its desires are fading away, but the person who does God's will remains forever. John 2:17

but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat of it you will surely die. Genesis 2:17

Very interesting. I wonder if this was intended or mere happenstance. A lot of these verses sort of...*fit*.
 




 I saw it...curiouser and curiouser... 




 You spelled "Idiots" wrong. 




 Good read, opinion adjusted, but, reading the report, I feel like the main thing I learned is that here is another example of a complex economic system being described two very different ways. The ROI of 7:1 (I wasn't familiar with the 22:1, that seems high!) and 1:10 shows the difference between NASA *contributing* to new ideas, and the *direct* effect of creating businesses or patentable new items that result in private sector profit. (I admit to being biased in favor of NASA, I live right down the road from America's Spaceport, and there's nothing like watching a launch light up the night sky over the Atlantic!) 




 We needed NASA to get us off the planet. And they did so. But only with the entire nation behind the endeavour, fueled by the Cold War scare. Now that we have been there, national interest is far lower, and the return on investment is perceived to be low, though the opposite has been proven, even showing that compared to other monies spent on government program, NASA has the best ROI than any other program in history. But, short of some international boogeyman threatening to take the moon from us, the future is going to be about money. NASA is more about science, and I think that they will continue that mission in the future, but the next space race is already on, and it's a race for revenue. Whether it will be from mining asteroids, or lunar tourism, or orbiting solar power generation stations, or even asteriod based robotic manufacturing plants, private companies will lead the way in further exploration as they try to find the money hidden in space. Overall, I feel like this is a good thing, private companies taking the risks, and reaping the rewards will mean that many private citizens in the near future will have access to space. This will lead to colonization, whether orbital, lunar, or other, and once humans are living in space, there will be more opportunites for people in support positions for those working in space based industry. (Those folks gotta eat, somebody will get up there and figure out how to open a restaurant, though I think a bar would probably be first!) 




 I think the media is being careful...there's a strong chance that this guy could end up looking a bit like a hero. Read the "manifesto" and ignore the second half, and it's like a Hollywood movie where the good guy is identified as the bad guy by the bad guys that wear the uniforms of the good guys.

Also, the MSM doens't go out of it's way to report on cops looking bad at their jobs, and so far Dormer is making the LAPD look like a bunch of boy scouts. Watch, when they catch (and kill, most likely) this guy, this story will suddenly get a whole lot of coverage. 




 Sure, sure, sure, let's all sit down and have a rational conversation, but ask yourself, *is it funny?* (Note: I don't think the situation is funny, really it's just a bit disturbing, and probably would be best handled in some other fashion than mine, but if they choose to take my advice I feel I should add that they put a camera in the box as well, you know, *for the funny!* 




 If I had a penchant for stealing panties from my female friends and GFs of my male friends, and got a box full of panties, and *then* uncovered pictures of my male friends and BFs of my female friends wearing those panties, it would certainly make me think twice about repeating that behavior! Letters not necessary, I suppose, but a bonus, as OP stated that he wanted to preserve the friendship. 




 Tough question. Here's why. 

Sound: Everybody likes a different sound. And everybody plays a different style. Fingerstyle pickers want a real bright sound. Chorders want something that's going to ring out a bit. Compound that with the fact that the strings that I like on my acoustic are gonna sound different on yours.

Size: The gauge of the string is important as well. Real thin sets (from .007 or .008) are for real light players or softer sounds, heavier sets for the big strummers. Gauge of the sting will affect brightness to a small degree, with heavier strings, generally, being brighter.

Metal: Lots of different types of metal besides steel. Steel nickel wound. Brass/phosphorous. Hell, you can buy strings with a gold coat if you want. Different types of metals will give you different types of sounds and finger feel.

Price: Cheapo strings are usually just that, but expensive doesn't mean good.

Life: If you're touring, and changing sets every four days, then the life of your strings really doesn't matter. But if you're like the other 99.9% of us, you're probably on a budget, and want those strings to last a bit. Each company's strings are a little different here, and unfortunately the only way to compare is to buy them.
 
So, for me, I choose Martin Marquis 80/20 Phosphor/Bronze with the unwound Gstring, med gauge. (.009). Because, I like the way it feels on my fingers, I prefer a med-heavy gauge, because sometimes I like to get funky on my acoustic. I like the life of my Martin Marquis, I like C.F. Martin in general (my box isn't a Martin), and they formulate those strings for players like me; casual players that want ring and sustain, that want a long life from their strings, want to minimize breakage, and that play the style that I do, which is, mostly chords, some fingerstyle, some flatpicking, etc.

Try a few on for size and see what you like. Talk to your shop guy, he probably plays, and probably has an opinion, and it is probably as worthless as mine! 

 




 Didn't think about cutting a blank to use as a template! Genius! I had planned on using a press (homemade, of course!) with the bit I was fantasizing about existing, with the wood clamped down. But the template thing might work for me; the goal is to cut a significantly large amount of same-sized discs. 




 Saw these when I made the trip to my local HD...but when I asked the orangeman if they had arbors without the drill bit I just got a blank stare.... 




 It seems so simple, but I cannot find what I'm looking for. I need a hole saw. But every one that I have found has the pilot bit on the arbor. I'm looking for a hole saw bit without the pilot bit. (I don't need the hole, I need the circle of wood...without a hole in the middle!) What is this thing called, and where can I find it? Gotta be quicker and more exact than my jigsaw! 




 1. Collect letters from all women missing panties, politely explaining that he should stop, but that they understand that he has a fetish that makes him do this.

2. Collect panties from all women involved.

3. Get a box. 

4. In the box from top to bottom should be:

* A typewriten note stating that you are still friends, hope this helps, enjoy the panties.
* Letters from the women involved.

* Panties.

* In the bottom of the box, include a picture of all the men that have had GF missing panties, dressed in the panties that are in the box, and nothing else. Dissapproving looks a bonus here.

Mail the box off, and wait. Something should happen. 




 Hmmm...Depends. If the eggroll was Chinese style, you most likely are looking at a snake fang. This signifies good luck in the Chinese culture. The tradition is that whoever ends up with that snake fang stuck in their upper gum is considered the "winner" and you should return to the restaurant/store for your prize!

If the eggroll was Japanese style however, it's probably a bird's talon, and it means that you have been marked for assassination by the Yakuza. You should probably find a safe house, lay low for a while.

If the eggroll was any other Oriental style, than you probably have a cat claw there....nothing to worry about. In this down economy, many eggroll manufacturers and restaurants are cost cutting however they can!

But, a word of caution, if this was an American style eggroll, you have found what is locally called "a reason to sue the shit tits off of somebody" and should lawyer up and get ready for your payday, even though there was no real harm to you.

Hope this helped!

Expertise: I've eaten like 14,000 eggrolls in my life. But I ain't never seent nothin like that! 









 As much as I love Family Guy, I save all my props for the music that you guys do...really over the top, and we appreciate it! Any thoughts about a full length Family Guy musical?
 




 These people must not ever have heard of the internet. When you tell us "Hey, don't manipulate this picture in any way" we say "Challenge accepted." 




 I would totally go check out someone who calls themselves Slappy McNuts....I don't know why, but I would have to know. I don't know what kind of performance I would expect, however. 




 Have you considered Slappy McNuts? Just off the top of my head... 




 Worth the read. It reminds me of some of King's early work, especially some of the short stories. Also, read his other works (Heart shaped box and 20th Century Ghosts)...he shows his father's quirk of linking his stories together. (BTW...20th Century Ghosts is outstanding, if a little confusing.) 




 I barely fit in them too...sometimes it's like carrying around a hotdog in a hefty bag. So what do you do? Tie it off with a bread tie? Duct tape? Rubber bands?  




 Nope...that's easy...awww, hell!! Bastard!

 Read on. 




 That's the one. It reads a bit like a textbook, but I believe that investing the time to get to know your DAW is going to help you in the long run. Happy recording! 




 Love it. Will buy, even not knowing what mold! 




 1. Not a lot of info here, but first guess is that if it's not showing in your VST plugin list it's because you haven't added it to your VST plugin list yet (those are two different actions). 

2. Hopefully it came with a book. Read it. Read it again. Take notes. Reference it. I love my cubase, but if I had any real complaints about it, it would be that it doesn't have a real "natural user feel" to it...there is a big learning curve. I use 4 still, and I'm still learning. Also check out [Steinberg.net](http://www.steinberg.net/en/home.html) for specific info about cubase, and [tweakheadz.com](http://tweakheadz.com) for general recording tips.

3. I love my cubase. It was built for digital (dance, edm, electronica, etc) but I use it for (mostly) live recording, and like more than any other DAW that I've used. Use the trial, if you like it, pull the trigger on the full version.
 









 I do all right playing the blues, but I play by ears and heart. I've heard some guys rip SRV perfectly, but it somehow misses something...Stevie had some reason for those notes that the rest of us can only experience, never replicate. 




 Pork, red onions, pineapple (or mango), plus spiciness. Yum. 




 I have no practical advice to give you, so I'll share a George Carlin quote instead. 

"It's not enough to know *how* to play the blues, you must know *why* to play the blues." 




 Strums for each chord, or rhythmic strumming pattern would depend on song and player choice. Assuming our example song is in 4/4 (common) time, you would have a lot of options.
 Whole note strumming would be strumming the chord one time, and letting ring for the other three counts of each four beat measure (Strum-two-three-four).  Half-note strumming would be strum-two-strum-four. This is way over simplified, as most rhythmic strumming is going to be a mixture of up and down strums, at a mixture of tempo, depending on song and player.

If you're asking for practice reasons, the easiest answer, for a 4/4 song, is to strum each chord four times per measure (quarter-note strumming). Your example song would be: E,E,E,E,D,D,D,D,G,G,G,G,A,A,A,A, in the 1-2-3-4 manner. 




 Ummm...all of them? Most of them, really. Not into bigger girls too much, but I that doesn't mean that I haven't found an individual bigger girl sexy. I'm probably the wrong dude to answer this, because yes, I love me some sexy bodies, but I am so easily turned off by negative attitudes, poor intelligence, unwilling spirit, etc. Give me an average looking girl with a can-do attitude, and I found the sexiest girl alive! 




 Slow cooking really is as easy as everyone says. But here's some protips:

* I really recommend against cooking from frozen due to the food being in the temperature danger zone for more than four hours. Most of the time you're going to be safe, but it's that one time that will change your life. Food-bourne illnesses will make you want to be dead. Thaw your meats a day ahead of time.

* Red meats really benefit from browning before crocking. If you have time, cut steaks into 1 ro 2" cubes, brown in oil, salt and pepper, (don't cook them, just brown the outside) and toss in the crock. Extra flavor here we come!

* Crocking generally means that you're cooking with a liquid. Over that large amount of time, your liquids are going to concentrate somewhat. Be careful when adding spices. If you put two tablespoons of salt in two cups of water, you're gonna come back to two tablespoons of salt in 3/4 cup of water. I add little spice/flavor at the beginning, taste about one hour before you expect to eat, and adjust accordingly.

* Don't be afraid of bone-in meat. Crock it, pull the bones. Slow heat breaks down all kinds of connective tissue, that's why crocking is so awesome.

* Because of above, don't be afraid of discount cuts of meat. Chuck roasts, chicken thigh, random chops of pork are all great meats that will break down easily.

* I had a horrible experience trying something with fish. I don't recommend it. But that's just me.

* Check recipes for ideas. You don't need recipes, but there are a lot of really cool ideas to crock up. Recipe is meat+liquid+seasoning+time. Simple.

* Have fun, and remember to turn your crock off when you're done with it. Worst baked on disaster ever! 




 No matter how much you shake and dance, the last drop always ends up in your pants. 




 Your school has nice balls. 




 Would also add a big hurdle for me to jump over, and hard lesson learned..

You are never "done" writing a song.

I've changed my songs over and over and over again. Each time I play it, it seems like I see an opportunity to improve the message the lyrics were trying to convey, or a slightly more fitting guitar phrase that fits the mood of the song. 

I have songs that I've been working on since a teenager, and while my friends from high school would probably recognize the song that I play for them, they would also recognize that it's nothing like the one they heard the first time, oh so long ago. 




 I've tried to share Zach Deputy on reddit so many different times...and nobody seems to appreciate him. Part of the problem is most of the YT vids are just not showing what it's like to see him live. Huge fan from FL, loving seeing someone else rep ZD! 




 In Boca, there is nothing to do but wait to die, and count old people. Enjoy the beach.
 




 I'm gonna go with... all of them. Hated the 90's. At least pop stuff. 




 Whatever you do, do not dumb yourself down. You might attract guys, but they might be the wrong kind. The reason that you are getting approached by older men are because older men (me!) also exude confidence, and generally have our shit together. 

Way I see it, two options: One, start talking to people, making plans, and starting things on your own. Not necessaryily asking guys out on dates, but start organising things on your own. If guys can talk to you a bit and get to know you, and find that you aren't that intimidating, your prospects might go up. Inversely, just start chatting the guys up, and go on and exude your confindence. Ask them..."So, when are you going to ask me out on a date?" Stay friendly, and I hope you find what you're looking for. (I did!) 




 True, and I stated that in my comment. My point was how many people are taking that little blue pill, not because they have limpus dickus, but because "the tv told me to ask my doctor"? 




 Wasn't selling "Uncle Leroy's Calmative" out of the back of a horse drawn trailer a business model? I can see the comparison. 




 True enough. I didn't think of energy drinks as "medicine"...I was looking more at big pharma taking the place of snake oil salesmen.
 




 Quacks and snake oil aren't really the issue anymore. Science has paved the way for a new style of schyster. 

It seems like now the goal is to develop the drug alongside the symptoms...diseases that we've never heard of now get nationwide commercial coverage as we discuss Restless Leg Syndrome, or how often a dude over 50 is supposed to be pissing.

I'm not belittling people that have real issues that need real medicine to help them, but how much were we as a nation discussing Erectile Dysfunction before the advent of Viagara? It seems from the content of commericial advertising that just about every healthy male over the age of 50 or so is in dire need of propping up their boners so their hot middle aged wife doesn't leave them for the tennis instructor. Same thing with ADD, ADHD, MAOI's, and the pharmacopia of antidepressants that are now available.

In short, why have fake meds when we can count on fake (ok, not fake, but trumped up, overstated, or broadly and casually diagnosed )diseases to make "real" meds for? 




 I would also suggest offering a small reward if you wanted the physical card returned to you (enough to cover postage and a bit to sweeten the deal) or specifying that you just want the data and providing an email address or website for the pics/data to be uploaded to.  




 To be considered an "Advanced" guitar player, the player must:

* Show up fifteen minutes late to practice. At least.

* Have visible tattoos/piercings. (Face tattoos will be accepted as a substitute for piercings, but multiple piercings will not be accepted in lieu of tattoos.)

* Refusal to carry any gear but his/her own to and from gigs.

* Must have one of the following: (Consistent alcoholism, recurring mental issues, or recovering addiction to hard drugs. (Marijuana does **not** count.))

* Must also have one of these advanced habits: (Playing parts of songs that the band does not know/perform while lead singer engages the crowd, the ability to sing backups in a mike that is not hot, or the ability to cue primadonna meltdowns on cue.)

And of course....**19**. 




 Love to throw with you, or buy you a beer. I'm bringing the team from New Smyrna down, six of us, to check out what Wickam Park has to offer. 




 Nice to see this. I've been talking about the "Big Mac Effect" for a long time, both on line and in person, declaring that as long as Joe Schmo can hit up the local McDonalds and get a Big Mac for a couple bucks, he's gonna think that everything's all right with the world. It's good to see some hard science that shows this. 




 Hmmm....bite two corners off my BBQ hot pocket and blow through the thing? Are you trying to get me to cool my hot pocket, or defaceify my wife? This seems like it could be a terrible idea....that I'm gonna try anyway! Look out puppies/wife/small children, daddy's blowing a lava pocket! 




 Upvote for visibility....better follow through. And be careful. They don't like being filmed when working, they certainly aren't going to like this.
 




 12" to 16", assuming your breath is okay. Any closer and you look a little rapey. 




 [Disco Duck](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxf2KCSyvgQ) (Yes seriously.) It was done by a radio dj and his band, Rick Dees and his Cast of Idiots. It was on an album of "funny" songs, lots of stuff that would have been featured on Dr. Demento's show. I was about five or six at the time. 




 Yep, got a lot to work with there. I should be ok. I'll just have another diet Dr. Pepper...*pop *fizz * slurp....shit, now I'm energetically depressed! Hand me my guitar and that pipe over there! *spark *puff *aaaahhhh...much better. 




 But the people on tv look so happy when they drink diet Dr. Pepper...has the doctor been lying to me? But, I drink diet sodas for my caffeine addiction, so I'm more likely to develop depression by drinking a beverage that reduces my chance of developing depression? Fuck, I'm confused. Probably all the diet sodas. 




 I've got a quick wit and an even quicker mouth, and it's gotten me into trouble plenty in the past...with gf/parents/job/school.

Got better and better jobs which required me to not act like a drunk monkey on a daily basis, and struggled with both cursing, and content, of what I was saying.

I developed what I call the "2 beat rule". Whenever I start to say something, I take just two beats (ill-defined segment of time, but long enough to review my intended statement) and think about what the other person will hear if I say what I'm about to say. 

More often than not, I choose to say nothing, because what I hear in my head suddenly sounds hurtful or base. 

But I let it rip later when I'm at the bar!

Good luck. Being aware of your language and the way you use it is really the first step. Whatever steps you take next will more than likely work because you have already identified a habit that you want to change. 




 Every Asshole Does Grass But Eggbert is how I learned them back in the stone age! 




 Nope. I liked the remake for the multiplayer, the level play was quite weak though. 




 yep, exactly...cool sound to add to your repertoire on acoustic. 




 Goldeneye. Nintendo 64 or WII. 




 Ahh...the good old Teapot Dome scandal! Good God I love history! 




 1. Probably the post WWII to Vietnam era.

2. Civil War.

3. Lots. I had a really awesome teacher in HS, and we talked about a lot of things that were left out of our sanitized textbooks. I wish I had spent more time with him, but he inspired me to look for my own truths, and I have for the last thirty years. Thank you, Mr. Postlethaite, OHS!

4. You could...maybe group SMS for historical events? Today in history, or that sort of thing...

5. I am an employer, but I don't think I care about your knowledge of US history, outside of if you had a college degree, because any degree is a good thing.


Thanks for being a teacher, keep up the good work! 




 Sounds like reasonable parenting, so that's probably not an issue. And good relationships at home (I'm still a fan of stay at home parents, doesn't matter which one!). ANd I read RefuseBit's comment, and wonder if maybe that might be part of it...eight is a strange age, he might be gifted, but without the ability/vocabulary to express his interests, combined with his sort of timidness might lead to the kind of behavior that he's evincing. 

Overall, I think he bears watching, but I wouldn't overworry. You sound like a cool aunt/uncle; stay involved, and help him evolve, and take him back to the lab! My kids would be so jealous! 




 It was awesome of her, and I'm lucky, because she has been and still is adventurous, and we've had much fun because of that...but I still know that I haven't made up for that night...lol. I hope it works out awesome for all three of you guys!
 




 I would be thrilled beyond belief. I've talked to my SO about this before, and it doesn't seem to be her thing, but a guy can hope! I would say be careful, because you just don't know where his head might be at any given day...you would want to tease him, give him clues about what was about to happen instead of an outright surprise.

Let me share a story with you. 

Long ago, before my wife was my wife, I was working at a restaurant near the house. A bit too far to ride the bike, she would give me a ride and pick me up at night when I got off, around midnight most nights.

She comes to pick me up, and I open the door to slide into the car, and there she is, my beautiful eventual wife, in all her naked glory, sitting in the driver's seat.

Unlike every other guy in the world, instead of being thrilled about this turn of events, I half-smirk, say something stupid, and get in the car to go home. (I don't remember what I said, my wife's a redditor, perhaps she'll stop by and tell you what dumb thing I said instead of telling her how beautiful she is, or how impressed I was with her being so brave to surprise me by picking me up completely naked.)

What she didn't know is that I had just gone through one of the worst days of work I had ever had. To her credit, I no longer remember what was so terrible that night, I just have a very clear memory of her amazing naked body shining in the dome light of her VW Rabbit! 

Just sayin' be careful of an outright surprise...you might not get the disired result. You probably will, but there's that outside chance that his head might not be in the right place...and it would be terrible if another man on this planet was stupid enough to ruin something awesome by not being able to shift gears fast enough!

    (sorry babe!) 




 Keep the pick hand moving during the ring-out portion of the chord, just lift the pick off the strings.

Practice this by keeping the 16th notes by percussing them with your pick on your pick guard while the chord rings out.

Essentially you will be working on two seperate rhythms at that point, one strum, one percussive...eventually you will be able to just skip the percussive part, and feel that staggered rhythmic pattern. 




 Father of two, boy 8, girl 5.

A lot of the behavior that you talk about when he was visiting the lab seems pretty normal to me, or at least age appropriate. My boy is not real "hands on" with new stuff, but he loves to learn new things and be around new things. I think that if he went to work with his uncle (not a scientist (how cool!) but road construction) he would love all the machines and cool stuff, but might be leery of actually getting involved. Some boys are different, and would be all kinds of hands on, to the point of seeming like mania.

The defiance could be described as normal for his age group as well. This is the time that they start to understand themselves, and he may be pushing the boundries to see what he can get away with. How's the mom and dad at home? If they're allowing this behavior to go unchecked or are unwilling disciplanarians, they might be fostering these sorts of problems. (When you describe impatience for future goals/rewards and change of situational difficulties, it sounds like he's maybe not getting negative reinforcement of these behaviors at home.)

The scaredness, (or timidness) that I sensed you were talking about might be something that you should watch. It could mean a lot of different things; from the relatively normal i.e. he's just sensitive/timid, to the relatively severe i.e. he's got something either real or imaginary to be scared of, and is acting on these feelings.

Overall, he sounds kinda like a normal eight year old boy to me, assuming all developmental skills are about where they are supposed to be. 

How's the relationship in between the boy and his parents? Are they stern enough in their demands about his diet, his habits, his bedtime ritual? Or are they enabling his bad behavior by not being resolute? Did this behavior maybe start as a reaction to the new child in the house? Hopefully there's no overt favortism between the two children. Without knowing much more, I can be of no help, but overall, outside of the timidness/anxiety he doesn't sound that much different from my boy.

 




 Duuuuuuddde...really? Out in the rain? Ouch.

Sad to say, you might be fucked. You might be able to fool the folks at Taylor (read that: Fraud), but if they want to see the demolished piece of art that was your 714, they will see the water damage. If your warranty is through Taylor, might be worth contacting them and telling them that you're an idiot and maybe, just maybe, they might take pity on you. Doubtful, but possible. Outside warranty, probably best to try to go with fraud. 

I'm sorry for your loss. Hope you have a backup box so you can still play the blues!
 




 1. 40

2. Full time manager

3. 14M (step-son, part time contact), 8M (at home), 5F (at home).

4. Job doesnt give me traditional weekday/weekend, but I have five work days, two off, so whatev. Typical day starts around 7am. Breakfast. One hour of either TV or video games. (assuming not a schoolday). One to two hours of self-play, generally in their rooms, sometimes outside. Together time until lunch. Lunch. Open afternoons, depends on what has to happen that day, sometimes errands, sometimes recreations, sometimes crafts. Dinner preparation is family time, dinner is family time. After dinner routine that leads to bedtime. Good is being a dad, stressful is getting young kids to do stuff together is like trying to herd cats. 

5. Struggling to make every day relevant, and stay involvled with the kids. I'm tired all the time, and work too much, so is tough to stay involved instead of just sleeping all day.

6. I don't really ever feel defeated as a parent. I generally feel that I'm doing a better job than most dads in similar situations.

7. Not really reliant on goods or services when it comes to the kids, but in the spirit of the question, would have to say either Netflix/Internet, or the Wii. They both allow the kids some time doing something that I only have to half supervise, allowing me time to do some grown-up things. 




 The very reason I can't suggest The Joy of Cooking enough is because it can be read *both* as a textbook **and** a cookbook. As far as skill set, there is an assumption that you've been in the kitchen before, but the "About" sections that preface each subject area covers more advanced cooking methods and such. Just a few days ago, I couldn't remember for the life of me how long to boil carrots (i could have just watched them, but I had other stuff on the stove, and that was the first step in a recipe) and I quick referenced my Joy so I could work on my timetable. 

Check your local library and see if they have a copy, and give it a looksee before you pull the trigger, but I wouldn't want to cook in a kitchen that didn't have The Joy of Cooking in it. 




 I have found that many people that have nearly fabulous handwriting hate their handwriting far more than I do...and I have the handwriting of a drunk monkey. Long ago I switched to an all caps scrawl (that I later learned was called Architectual Block Printing) that more easily conveys my message without error. Since switching, people have commented how neat my handwriting is, and I am nothing if not amused at what amounts to a utilitarian choice for legibility being appreciated for its form. 




 Hot Snakes? Awesome! I needed that phrase so badly; it's the holidays! Fuckin' hot snakes! Too broke for gold, have a orangered instead. 

Hot snakes....yessss. 




 A good friend told me that whenever I am faced with a difficult choice to flip a coin...not because you should trust in the random to decide your fate, no matter how small the issue, but because in that brief moment, while the coin is in the air, you will know what your heart truly desires.

I use it without fail. 




 Spend the 50 bucks on beer, get him drunk, take the axes, tell him he told you you could have them. 




 Had to be. Probably riverside, or near Pappa's. 




 I've seen some terrible things here in the N.S.B., but I've been lucky enough to avoid this. Must be mainland, shit like that just doesn't happen on the island. 




 Thank goodness for that giant red arrow. I wouldn't have been sure what to look at in that video. 

"Oh, look at all these people standing around watching something...meh, that's pretty cool, I guess"

"Wait, what's this red arrow?"

"Holy shit, a fucking elephant, fuckin' shit up!"

Thanks Red Arrow! 




 Yep, still checking the fish about whenever I bring new fish in...no questions on best preparations, how to clean/gut/scale, etc. 




 I am not familiar with the class, so my opinion may be uninformed, but I would think short of a professional culinary instruction in a classroom setting, that you would be wasting that $50.

First, take that $50 bucks, and buy [The Joy of Cooking](http://www.amazon.com/Joy-Cooking-75th-Anniversary-Edition/dp/0743246268/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1356534467 sr=8-1 keywords=the+joy+of+cooking)...not your typical "Cookbook"...it has plenty of recipes, but each section/chapter is prefaced with the "why" of cooking...why heat causes meat to brown, why you must scale certain types of fish, why herbs are best fresh, etc. Great book, and constant companion of mine while in culinary school, at home, and at work. And, you can spend that thirty bucks left over on something nice.

I don't know where you live, but any medium sized metro area is going to have classes offered on a single basis (i.e. outside a degree program). Check places that focus on alternative eating...fresh markets, vegetarian/vegan shops, etc...these places often will offer a single class on a single subject for a reasonable amount of dough.

And can't say enough about experience...one of the best ways to get a feel for your kitchen is to spend a lot of time in it! And take notes. seriously....if you are having problems with consistency when it comes to seasoning, start note taking and measuring what you're using, and then make notes about how you felt about the taste, adjust next time, take more notes, fine tune, end up with something that works for you, and is probably pretty tasty! 




 Right there with you. I brought it up to my wife, and she's given it a go a few times, but she says it's not her thing. Makes her happy to see me have a good time, but can't get her to initiate without having to almost beg. I think it's maybe more taboo for a female to be on the giving end of anal than it is to be on the receiving?...either way, it still makes me happy, and every now and then is better than never now or then, right?

 Depends on what you mean by artifacts. There haven't been people here for very long, but you can still find traces of them. I've personally [walked through a fort in Florida that was constructed in 1672](http://www.nps.gov/casa/historyculture/index.htm), [found bullets and a piece of a belt buckle at the sight of a civil war battle in Florida](http://battleofolustee.org/battle.html), [taken gravestone rubbings of some of the oldest graves in Northern Florida](http://www.seefloridaonline.com/_tallahassee/cemetery.html), and [got to see 120,000 year old mastadon bones dug up right in my city!](http://www.news-journalonline.com/article/20120929/NEWS/309299990/1064?Title=Prehistoric-passion-Mastodon-bones-draw-crowd-to-museum) 




 I hope you are who you are. I wish that you would message the mods some proof. Lacking that, let me begin...

I am so sorry for your loss. I know that means nothing, but I sat at work Friday morning, watching the coverage, and barely controlled my tears as I thought of those poor children, and those poor parents. My heart, and the thoughts of my entire family, have been with the parents and families of Sandy Hook for the past few days.

Question: How exposed were you to the media coverage, and what, overall, sort of job do you think the major media did to cover this story? And, do you feel that that sort of coverage is appropriate? Is this a tragedy for the nation, or should it have been a little more low-key?

 









 Dio!!! 




 I hear ya. I run a small club, and we limit to ten people, but we play way early on Thursday mornings on an uncrowded course, and stay very aware of people coming up behind us, usually giving way for playthrough a hole ahead of them. But that happens rarely.

More often, our group gets stuck behind a group of two or three that have never played before, and chuck plastic into the woods like there's no tomorrow, and most of the time, after explaining etiquette, and exchanging tips, we both go our serarate ways, happy...but not always....not always. 




 I love Fat Tuesday's! Used to have one here in Daytona, but they took it away from me! Now when I need delicious adult frozen beverages, I must buy them at 7-11, and pour FourLokos in them! But, a sad bonus, because of the 7-11 cup, I can bring them most anywhere! 




 I've taken a Jung test before, didn't really understand it too much. Found you guys, (/r/INTJ first, followed the link, took my test, looked for you, found you) and after a brief bit of googleresearch and reading through the posts here...wow. Just wow. Didn't realize that there were so many people like me out there. Happy to find you.

Minus sign  (  ) to exclude


Placing  a minus sign immediately before a word indicates that you do not want pages that contain this word to appear in your results. The minus sign should appear immediately before the word and should be preceded with a space. For example, in the query [ anti-virus software ], the minus sign is used as a hyphen and will not be interpreted as an exclusion symbol; whereas the query:  [ anti-virus software ] will search for the words 'anti-virus' but exclude references to software. You can exclude as many words as you want by using the  sign in front of all of them, for example [ jaguar cars football os ]. The  sign can be used to exclude more than just words. For example, place a minus sign before the 'site:' operator (without a space) to exclude a specific site from your search results.

 I'll be honest with you. I care. Really. I'm a father, 5 and 8, the same age as some of those kids that were shot and killed today. 

I'm a man, a burly manly, Ron Swanson type man.

I was at work, and had trouble controlling my emotions as I watched the events in Newtown unfold.

I don't know the families....but I have a family. I don't know the victims, but I felt like a victim, in a very very small way compared to what those people were dealing with, for the loss of innocence, of safety, of feeling like it was totally okay to drop my kids off at school in the morning, and know that they would be there when I showed up to pick them up.

I'm aware of the situation in the Congo, I know about the humanitarian crisis in most of sub-saharan Africa. I don't know much about Burma, but I've been following the stories out of Syria. Terrible things happen all the time.

But sometimes I forget that. I'm American. Most of the time, things are pretty okay here. 

Not today.

Sensationalism? I agree with you; if more attention was paid to the crises in other parts of the world, it might be easier to empathize with them.

But this was our home. Done by one of us. To some of us.

I made a FB post about it...I didn't know what else to do. I just wanted to cry, or to find my kids and hug them, and hold them close, knowing that they were okay, and that I could still protect them from the harsh ugliness of the world. I wanted to do more...more to help those people, more to feel like I was protecting my kids.

I don't grieve for them...I didn't know any of them, but I grieve for the innocence of my kids. I will spend a large portion of my day tomorrow talking about this with them; having a difficult conversation with two very young people that I care very much about, that I love more than anything else in this world; a conversation where I must admit, as their father, their protector, their rock, that yes, there are bad people in this world, the boogie monster is real sometimes, there might be someone that wants to do you and/or your family harm.

I'll tell them that the most important thing is to be careful, aware, and safe.

I'll tell them that we are a family, and that we will do anything we can to protect each other.

I'll tell them what I have to, to make them feel okay again.

And I wish that I could do that for the families that lost children today.

And I wish that someone could tell me that everything that I've worried about today was nothing. That I didn't have to worry about ever losing my children to violence or accident.

But today proved that no one can do that for me. And there are parents out there, right now, that learned an even more difficult lesson.

I may have no business grieving or not grieving for the pain and challenges of strangers, but I won't apologize for the emotions that I have as I witness the loss of these kids...the loss of these families...the loss that we *all* felt today, because of a silly notion of whether I have a right to or not. 




 No problem. It's hard sometimes when you realize how exposed our children are to the hurt and bad and ugly in this world. I'll be sharing something I learned from Mr. Rogers long long ago. Words from his mother... 

"When you see something bad happen, remember that there are helpers. If you look, you will find them, people that are helping other people. Know they are there, and find hope when you see them." 









 Yep, I saw those in the wild the other day, but didn't have the balls to buy and try...I was shopping with my wife; when I do, I leave the balls at home.

 Florida is a "right to work" state.

I am a manager with about 30 employees here in Florida.

As far as I can tell, "Right to work" here in Florida means that "Right to fire your sorry ass whenever the fuck I want for no apparent reason, and good luck getting any Unemployment Compensation or Welfare, you stupid no job-having poor person!"

As far as I can tell, anyway. 




 Donny Osmond fronting Megadeth. Or Brittney Spears fronting GWAR. Either one, really. 




 I don't know, I've made some pretty epic fail decisions in my time.
 









 All of them. Every. Single. One. 




  Discs do not fly out of your bag by themselves and hit trees.

I don't know, have you played a bad round with me before? It sure can seem like that...lol.

Seriously, glad to hear somebody else say it. I run a little club, and I see it all the time. New disc, show it off, throw it once, hook it, throw it in the sales pile. 




 Waxing! *slaps forehead...didn't even think of that. 




 Semi assembled. Free wheel assembly is done, crank assembly is done. 




 I'm putting together a new beach cruiser for Christmas. I'm confident in my abilities to do so, but had a few questions that you could maybe help me with?

* Gotta lube up those metal on metal parts, right? What lube? Silicone, 3in1, poly, teflon? What's best for me? (I live on the beach, btw.)

* Rust proofing! I live on the beach, and chrome is no match for the salt. What do? I bought a bike that has a minimum of chrome (handlebars, rims, and spokes)...how can I weatherproof these areas (hopefully semi-permanantly) so that they don't rust out?

* Any other tips and tricks that a noob like me needs to know before putting together a bike for the first time?

Thanks /bikewrench! 




 How much is this plastic frog figurine? 




 Fuck CC, they fired Bull from RealRadio 104.1 in Orlando. There's noise that they might be canning more.  




 Open mikes, open jams. Post your own CL add with clear expectations. Do some shitty gigs, and spread the word. Check sites like Bandmix.com. Keep trying. Takes time, so take your time. 




 I don't get depressed and I wouldn't let my kids get upset either. I like it when there is no one on the playground, it means Daddy gets to go wild! (A serious side note, as a father, a hairy, burly one, I often suffer from stares and watchful looks when on the playground with the kids, especially when I go (with them) by myself. It's a whole lot better when there is no one there.) 




 Long ago, Bill Cosby used to be funny. Why Is There Air is the beginning of his unfunny decline into the goofy faced jello pop slinging pudding pimp Huxtable shamed idiot that we all remember from Thursday nights at 8 in the '80's. Listen to it, it ain't so bad.

 Absolutely. I'm glad somebody said it. But while I have you here, what's the best thing for me to watch videos on my TV? Should I go with an off the shelf Roku, or maybe jailbreak an Apple TV with XBMC?  




 Not necessarily, remember that Stan knew something the rest of the Losers did not...[that It was pregnant](/spoiler), still not a gunslinger move, but [Susannah waved off the quest at the very end of her own choice as well.](/spoiler) Some things are too big, even for gunslingers; or, if you prefer, Roland was a gunslinger's gunslinger. 




 When I play alone, I can't get high...no focus. Fun to just fuck around with the guitar when I've been smoking, but not for practice. When playing with other people however, especially ones that I am comfortable with, it adds confidence and overall jamability. 

But maybe that's just me. 




 There be a crib up in New Orleans
They call tha Risin Sun
And itz been tha ruin of nuff a skanky boy
And Dogg I know I be one

My fuckin mutha was a tailor
Biatch sewed mah freshly smoked up blue jeans
My fuckin daddy was a gamblin' man
Down up in New Orleans

Now tha only muthafuckin thang a gambla needs
Is a suitcase n' trunk
And tha only time he be straight satisfied
Is when he be straight on a drunk

Oh mutha rap r children
Not ta do what tha fuck I have done
Spend yo' lives up in sin n' misery
In tha Crib of tha Risin Sun

Well, I gotz one foot on tha platform
Da other foot on tha train
I be goin' back ta New Orleans
To wear dat bizzle n' chain

Well, there be a crib up in New Orleans
They call tha Risin Sun
And itz been tha ruin of nuff a skanky boy
And Dogg I know I be one

 New Smyrna Beach, FL, sharkbite capital of the world! 




 Skinny girls. 




 Thats a really good idea, I'll float it to the club and see what we think.
 




 Planned on that...most of what I've seen so far has been about league play assuming handicaps were already figured, but I did do a pretty broad google. 




 And to keep score.  




 I gave the forums a cursory glance, and didn't see anything right away, but will check more when I get off work. I thought about two pools, but the group's not quite big enough for two or more pools yet. 




 Everybody has suggested that, and we thought about a "challenge day" of doing that very thing, but we play with someone who is ambidextrous...but we could make him play with his feet... 




 Will do, didn't think about looking there. Checked DiscGolfersR.us and didn't see much. 




 No, for real, I just don't get it. Anybody want to give me some tips? I want to take our little amatuer league to the next level, but I can't bring in better players and worse players than are already involved and keep it fun (and fair) for everyone.

So, how would you handicap a small club?

* We play on one course only (relatively easy, relatively short, highly technical)

* There are currently 10 players, but we want to expand.

* Co-ed.

* Skill levels from experienced to brand noob.

* Cash is involved, so must be fair, and managable.

* Once a week play, one round (18 holes) only. 




 I've been looking at those on amazon! I just don't know what the hell they are and what they do. Gonna have to do more research. 




 We checked that out at our local library, but I didn't see her get too excited about anything in it. I was thinking about something like books of patterns, or parts...like how to do pockets, corners, double seams, etc. 




 Well, I am the epitome of dudeness...she sews skirts, kids clothes, baby blankets, embellishments to store bought clothes...quilts a little (I'm assuming the definition of "quilts" as "stuffed squares sewn together"). She has a pinterest, but just started, and I know what's on it, but mostly stuff that falls into the "other crafts" category. She also does great work with over the shoulder bags. 




 Tough call. The Cameo looks like it would be better for what we do...(not just for sewing, we screenprint too). Have to think about that... 




 She's set as far as a sewing machine...for now. We've looked at some higher end options, but that's a later-on gift. A serger is something that she has mentioned. 




 I wouldn't even begin to guess about patterns and fabric for her! 




 She's a machine sewer mostly, but she does quilting as well.  




 I was thinking about GCs as well, but for the wife (that's why I'm asking) it seems a little impersonal, at least as the main gift.
 




 A serger might be a little out of my price range...but interesting. I don't know what they do, or if it would be appropriate as a gift for my wife, but the Cameo...a little pricey, but could work for a couple of different crafts. What do you think about lower priced comparibles to the Cameo Sillhouette? 




 Love those, but that would be a better gift for me than for her! 




 A light is something that I've been considering. Also scissors, because I'm husband, and kids. Would little stuff like pins, thimbles, needles, pincushions be safe? Or would you be super particular about what you get?
 




 I'm asking for ideas for my wife...isn't a husband buying his wife an iron grounds for divorce? But seriously, a nice iron would be a good gift? She has one, but it's older than our relationship...lol. 




 Lol...I'm a he, asking to get some ideas for my wife...I'm so lost when it comes to this stuff! (I'd love to get her a high end machine, but a grand is a little out of our budget!) 









 That comment just is begging for me to yell out "Your Mom!", but I think you're asking where I live? Volusia County, New Smyrna Beach, take 44 out of Eustis, head east until you hit the beach, and I'm on the right. 




 The easy answer is Space Monkey. Why? It's epicness is only overshadowed by the obvious need of my blank wall to support Space Monkey Art. I would hang this in my music studio (corner of my living room) and create a song about Space Monkey for Collage-o-rama. What you do with it at that point is up to you! 

Space Monkey Mafia, Unite! 




 I started surfing long long ago, but gave it up after I moved away from the coast. After many many years, I found myself back on the east coast of Florida, surrounded by new friends and decent waves. So I'll share the story of the first time I returned to surfing.

Some old friends of mine planned a trip to the coast to come see me and casually mentioned getting some wavetime in. I hadn't been surfing for about 20 years at that point, but figured what the hell, can't be too hard.

I went down to my local surf shop and picked up a used long board, 9.6 softtop, and told my friend that our weekend would be a go.

Over the next couple weeks as I waited in anticipation for good friends and good times, I tried to make time to get out and practice a couple of times, but just couldn't find time. (I work way too much).

The week before our surf weekend, checking the weather showed me that there was a storm developing. A big one. Might be Cat 1 hurricane, well offshore, by the weekend we had plans. Didn't worry too much, just thought we'd get some solid waves.

Nope.

The day before my friends came down, I went over to the shore to check the waves. It was washing machine time, but on steriods. The waves were big, but no rhythm, no sets, just muddy, and **angry** looking large chop.

I went home hoping for a better look the next day.

Friends showed up early, about dawn, and we checked the beach out immeadiately. If anything, it had gotten worse. My friends were determined to try it anyway, and I wasn't going to be the one to say no.

Two of my friends had some surf experience; long boards on the north florida gulf shore, and one was from some center of the country state that had never seen water larger than a lake, and didn't know jack about surfing.

So we get ready, and decide to have a couple of cans of liquid courage before we head across the street to defeat the monster. Heads held high, and feeling no pain, we carry our boards over to the shore.

We get out into the muck. My two friends with longboard experience have slightly less trouble than I do getting through the muck to search for the break, such as it was.

I had a moment where I knew things were going to go bad. My neighbors are all surf shop monkeys, and two of them were out in the muck, body boarding. As I struggled to get past the chop, one of them drifted close to me and said "you're either really brave or really stupid, bro!". I almost turned around at that point.

Almost.

By then, my friends are out trying to catch a few. Doing okay. The third friend, no surfing experience, is sort of just drifting down the beach, getting his ears washed out for him.

I finally get out of the mess, sort of on the back side of the break, and I straddle my board to catch my breath, and take in my surroundings.

Friends one and two are surfing. Not great, but there were waves, they were just short lived and messy. Friend three, no where to be seen.

Relaxing for maybe too long, I notice that I'm drifting not just down the beach, but out. I'm heading to Africa, so I paddle in a bit to try and catch my first wave.

I'm just paddling casually, not pushing hard, just coming in, and I feel a bit of upwelling lift me up. Out of nowhere, I've paddled on top of a monster. (It was a monster to me!) The wave develops underneath me, and I've surfed a bunch back in the day, but never saw a wave develop from that point of view, not on the face, not on the front, but teetering on top. 

I'm not so much paddling into the wave now as much as I'm falling into it, so I get up to me knees as I'm dropping in to this wave curling underneath me.

I surfed for about 1.6 milliseconds.

The wave buried me, tossed and turned, took a nasty hit from the board, had to push off the bottom to get a few whitewater breaths, tossed and turned, yanked by my leash, finally get my head above water, and start heading in.

I get to shore right about the time the lifeguard gets to me. I sort of plop down in front of him, he's asking if I'm alright, I'm embarrassed as shit, and tourists are gathering. One of them points out that I'm sitting a growing pool of blood. 

Kind of roll over to my side, and my upper thigh, right where it meets buttcheek, is total hamburgered. Took a fin in the crease. Friends gone, embarrassed enough, I wave off anymore help and hobble home to face the wrath of my wife.

Short wrap-up: I make it home, eventually first two friends make it back, we have beers and laughs. Friend three still missing. Finally shows up after hours, just drifted down the beach, and crossed the inlet, ending up in neighboring town, hitched a ride home with beach cops. Drank more, laughed more, did not surf more.

tl;dr. I'm old, don't drink and surf.

 You play hockey in a bathroom stall? Who wins? 




 Good luck. 




 Outstanding.

But your job isn't over yet. Now she knows. You must reinforce this feeling of universal oneness that's going to overcome her by sneaking 42 into her life even more, even more stealthily than before. Have fun! 




 It's just an Em7...you don't have to hate on it. I don't know of any specific song that "features" that chord, but it pops up everywhere. As an acoustic player with a decidedly chucka-chunka style, I use that chord, when it fits, to transition through a lot of chord changes with furious rhythm. 




 I wish you luck, fellow onomotophagic. I tried and tried and tried. I used hot sauce, no bite laquers, gloves, just about everything. It's a tough habit to break. 

Good news? It took six seperate attempts, a little bit of self-loathing, and almost two years, but I haven't bit my nails in a few months now (after biting for over 30 years) with some nice new growth, and going strong!

What finally worked for me was just positive thinking, and telling myself I could do it, and everytime I failed I learned something new about what triggers my addiction.  




 When my wife and I, before we got married, were visiting our doctor about her first pregnancy, his distaste in our unmarried state was evident. My at-the-time-GF and I got into a semi-serious accident on Thanksgiving, about halfway through her pregnancy. She began to suffer from some joint and bone pain in her right hip. We asked our doctor about it on our next visit, and I shit you not, he suggested that we get tested for "bone herpes". 

tl:dr A new study has shown that other people waiting until marriage to have sex makes people that already made that decision feel better about the years of self-repression and frustration that they suffered. 




 It's called [chocolate bloom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocolate_bloom). It's either fat in the form of cocoa butter or crystalline sugar rising to the surface of the chocolate due to temperature extremes or the chocolate not being tempered correctly.
 




 That's a fun joint. Was just out there for the FolkFest last month.
 




 Where in Lake? I live in Volusia, NSB, but I'm in Eustis about once a month or so...my pops owns a place there....cheap beer and acoustic folk rock. [Olivias?](http://oliviascoffeehouse.com/index.asp) 




 Nope. Didn't even go to school here in NSB, didn't care much for high school, and you're describing the folks that I didn't care for when I was in high school 25 years ago. 

What I am is a football fan. HS, college or NFL, I like a good game, and this has been a good year for the 'Cudas. (I am also a fan of HS marching bands, my step-son plays baritone sax for the aforementioned Deland Bulldogs.) I just feel that this whole thing is getting blown way out of proportion. I've seen lots of HS ballgames this year, and years past, and there always is a little tension between the band and the players. They share the same field for warm-ups and pregames, and there just isn't much room at the high school level.  




 I live in New Smyrna Beach, the team that's doing the disrespecting...and we take our football seriously down here. Real serious. 

First, what they did was inappropriate. I hope they are running laps for it still...but the big deal that people are making about this here in the area, and to some degree state- and nationwide, is getting a little ridiculous. They ran too far out on the field? Relax. They'll run. But let's talk about the excitement of hs football here in this part of FL. NSB has swept the table, including big wins against cross county favorite, the Deland Bulldogs, (HS of Mike Gillislee, RB for UF Gators). They're the pick for the District champs this year. Been a few years since we've won Districts, so it's a big deal for the 'Cudas. Spruce Creek, while a great high school, is every other teams' punching bag. Never had a good football program out there, and this last game is sort of the last hurdle NSB Barracudas has to jump on their way to District play.

Creek's band should have been allowed the field to do their pre-game band thing, but let's not beat up a bunch of high school football players that are way excited about a great year of football.

I expect an apology from NSB will arrive at Spruce Creek anytime now, and I'll be wearing my Red and cheering on my 'Cudas next week. 




 It's called "crushing" or "crush fetish".

It's a type of paraphilia that some people get off on, sexually. (How? I don't fuckin' know.)

This chick, I don't know her name, but there has been a few of her vids bouncin' around the internet for a while. She's a "crush" star. (This one was bad...the one where she goes after kittens with high heels is worse.)

[Wikipedia on crushing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crush_fetish)

[And here's a story about a couple that did crush videos and got busted kinda recently.](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2191787/Man-woman-arrested-torturing-animals-cutlery-household-tools-shoes-crush-videos-sexual-fetishists.html) 




 Jeezus, where to start?

* I think that if I only sing louder, people will think I sing well.

* I think that I can play guitar really really well. (I can, just not while shithammered.)

* I think that people care about my opinions.

* I think that people that don't care about my opinions will have their minds changed if I yell at them really loudly, causing spit to fly out of my mouth into their eyes.

* I think that talking louder helps me prove my point.

* I often forget my point.

* Whiskey dick.

* I generally will have three or more beers/cocktails working at one time.

* I can never, ever, find my smokes. 




 Women don't understand golf. 





























 Also the first time the word "vagina" was said on film. 




 I love KSC....live right up the road a bit, and I don't get out there enough.

I'm a space and science nerd, and I find plenty to keep me interested there. Totally worth admission.

Unfortunately, there are several paid add-ons at the park now. Didn't used to be that way, but new times, new money. The biggest is the new Up Close tour, which gets you in the VAB and STS mission control. I think it's around $25 more, per person. I haven't done it yet, but I have friends that say it's totally worth it.

Overall, even without the add-ons, especially if you haven't been there in quite a while, I say go. Kids dig it, adults dig it, but do try to plan your trip around a launch. Check NASA's webpage or sites like Space.com to try and find a day when a rocket is going up.

Enjoy your trip to the Space Coast! 




 NASA unveils Opportunity's little known Whitewater Rafting Assisting Program; Mars a "veritable water-park".

 Really? Never tried the Blue, and like I said, not much of a Scotch guy, but reviews are great...and I hear good things from the customers at our bar that are always upset that we don't carry it. But that might be snobbery.
 




 [Johnny Walker has a complete line-up](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnnie_Walker#Blends) if you wanted to stay in the brand. I've had the Double Black, and I'm not much for the scotches, but it was gooood.

Or drop two bills for a bottle of Blue Label, and be a hero. 




 Be open and honest. It's your only hope.

Rip a page out of the girl's playbook and make a few pre-emptive comments to make sure she knows that she's hanging out in the friend zone.

But make sure that you're right about her being interested. This could possibly backfire in a big way. 




 I like boob-shaped boobs. 




 Dude here. 

Um, no. A lot of jokes, and there's an understanding that all of us do it, but that's about it.

I guess the closest I ever came to really having a conversation about it with a guy friend is recommending a personal lubricant (Coconut oil!) but no frank discussions. (My wife and I do, though) 




 I think it's completely okay to tell someone that you think they are wrong. But as an atheist, and a realist, I know from experience that people with deep held beliefs, especially those of faith, are not familiar with the idea of being wrong.

Sexuality and xtian beliefs are very difficult to navigate, and after OP states his issue as "GF won't have sex because of her christian reasons", I have great concern about any conversation along the lines of "Let me tell you why I think you are wrong about the way you feel about sex." OP's gf is likely translate that as "Let me tell you why your religion is wrong" which is probably a relationship ender, if she has strong beliefs.

Repeating myself, but certainly OP and gf have to talk. The two of them are going to be doing a lot of that, they will have to if they want a non-believer/believer relationship to work, but don't try to talk your way into sex, that's coercion at best, and when you combine that with trying to change someone's faith, it becomes something terrible.

My opinion. Meh. 




 Absolutely. But to attack those beliefs in order to change them, no matter how strongly he feels that she might be wrong in those beliefs, is wrong. 




 First off, your link is broken, it goes to the search page. But I found what you are talking about.

1. Lust and Fornication are sins. You are shit outta luck here bud. If she believes, then she believes, and belief is going to tell her that what she wants is wrong, and is bad. That's a tough one to get over.

2. Virginity is a gift. Sure it is. And if you guys are in love, then give it to each other. 

3. The risk of pregnancy. It is true that not having sex is a pretty sure fire way to not get pregnant. But my wife and I have had sex....oohh about 7 billion times and we have far less children than that.

4. Heartaches from dating. Sure, breaking up is terrible. But if you guys are sure that you're going to be married and like totally in love forever and ever, shouldn't be an issue then.

5. Virginity is cool. No, no it isn't. Neither is not being a virgin. It's just a state of being.

6. Sexual purity and God's plan. If she believes, then she believes. See point 1.

7. Fornication is not healthy. Well, unprotected sex might be risky, but the human body is built to do this sort of thing, so not so much.

Listen, if she has deep set xtian beliefs, you're going to have to respect that. You can't talk her out of thinking that her virginity is God's gift to her, for her to give to her husband, and only her husband, without attacking her religion at large. If you do that, then you don't respect her, and without respect you guys have no hope for that ever after bit that both of you are hoping for. (You can however, lead her to read, and maybe she'll begin to question her faith on her own, and then you can be there to help, but you can't push. Taking someone's faith just so you can take their virginity is a very special kind of rape.) Best of luck. 




 I've been on both sides of the bar for these events, and I can't tell you how true this is. If you don't tip, or don't tip well at free events, you will be ignored. A big tip will help me remember you.

 I don't think too many authors write like Robbins...but I liked [Chuck Palahniuk](http://chuckpalahniuk.net/) (Fight Club, Choke, Invisible Monsters) a lot, and for some of the same reasons. Be forewarned, he's far darker than Robbins. 




 I don't hold on to paperbacks. I buy a lot of them, but I feel that paperback books need to be free. If I like a book, I buy it in hardback, and shelve it. Most paperbacks I read and then set free. 




 If it's Fox news, does it really belong in r/news? 




 Not at all. I never saw my mom or dad drink when growing up. I have had a beer with my pops in the past five years, but I don't think that he does much drinking. 

I'm a more-or-less daiiy drinker.

I think my dad's dad, who died early, might have been an alcoholic. There wasn't much talk about it, but I get that feeling, you know. 




 I too am a FOH guy, though trained and most comfortable as BOH. I sort of fell into a job as a FOH guy, with food safety management responsibilities.

I like my job, it has its perks, but I'm working for less than I'm worth. Was hired on for less than I'm worth. Made that deal with the devil so my kids could go to a good school, and I live on the beach, and super close to work, so all good.

I hired on as the fourth manager. After the first one got fired since I was there (for theft and drugs) the boss decided to not replace. After the second one got fired (also theft and drugs) it was just the GM and I. 

During the next four years, we have had manager after manager brought in and fail. 

There was the KM that was transferred over from another unit to avoid sexual harassment charges. He was fired after a threat of another sexual harassment charge.

There was a FOH manager that was brought in that couldn't count. Couldn't keep his hands off of the girls. Made threats instead of plans. All around douche. He was fired, basically for being a douche.

There was the combo manager, FOH/BOH, that acted like it was his first time in the kitchen, had no idea how to talk to either customers or employees, and spent most of his time on the phone threatening his ex-girlfriend. (His wife had died under somewhat suspicious circumstances, as well). He was fired for being ineffective, and went over to his ex-girlfriends house and shot himself.

I put up with all of this and more. Got a couple of raises, basically each time someone got shitcanned, but not enough, but I appreciated the gesture. During this time, sales were down terribly, we work in a tourist town, and the recession fucked us, so I didn't make waves.

Last month, we brought in a KM to train for another restaurant, and a FOH guy for ours. (Side note, to explain how batshit insane the boss man is sometimes, our KM approached our boss interested in moving from hourly at our restaurant, to salary at the other unit. He was turned down, and then asked to train the KM that was going to take the job that he applied for. It was super effective.) 

While doing some EOM paperwork, I noticed an email that talked about how we were going to distribute the labor burden for the KM trainee, and I saw that he made 2k less a year than I did. Pissed. Did some digging and found out that the new FOH guy was hired on at 2k plus what I was currently making. More pissed.

Wouldn't have been that big of a deal, but this FOH guy doesn't do anything. Like all day, nothing. Walks around, talks on the phone, and does a hundred little things that work against the restaurant, not for it.

I approached my boss, and explained that this was unacceptable, and that if she was interested in keeping me (we get along famously and are a good team) that this needed to be addressed.

She approached the boss man, and the response that she got was "I didn't think that he (me) liked his job anyway..."

I started looking for new work the next day. Still there, but not for too much longer, and I won't be going out of my way to give notice or help train a replacement. 




 Yeah, sandwich stuff. All those ingredients going into the po-boys will have to have been prepared ahead of time.

Proteins: Peeling, cooking, cooling shrimp, slicing meats, that kind of thing.

Breads: Buying bread from a supplier means you'll have to slack (thaw out) bread, as it probably comes in frozen, if it's fresh, you're in early to bake. (Early, like 4 am)

Veggies: All have to be sliced and panned, for each days service.

Sauces: Prepped and/or cooked each day.

General Line Setup: Rotating stock, checking for freshness, getting ready for the day.

If you have any specific questions down the line, I'd be glad to help. I'm a trained chef, currently a food safety manager and supervisor, been working in the restaurant industry for 25+ yrs, from no star to four star. 




 Depends on the restaurant, and the menu.

In our generic restaurant, every morning you would need to do recipes. Things like sauces, soups, gravies, desserts. Any thing that would need cooking. You don't want to have to do that during service. (That wouldn't be the case in a restaurant that was very fine dining, where a lot of sauces and such are prepared from scratch, to order.) You would also need to do set-ups. Things that you are going to use frequently through the day. Maybe you garnish a dish with slices of red pepper, you would have to cut enough slices of red pepper to complete the amount of plates you expect to sell that day. You would also need to do flow-through and line set up. That would be putting all of your ingredients on the line, making sure everything is set up for the upcoming day's business, making sure your ingredients are fresh. (The things you need on the line probably need to be prepped as well. Whether sliced onions for sandwiches, or pre-made entrees like chicken cordon bleu, for example)

This is a very generic overview. Without information about what sort of restaurant and what kind of menu, I can't get more specific than that. 




 Sticky pans. There are a couple of methods of pan release when baking cakes. It depends on what sort of cake you are making. Most importantly, you should have a non stick cake pan without dings, dents, rust, scratches, pocks or debris.

For most cakes, you can use a spray release like Pam. If you follow directions when baking, let it cool slightly before releasing, it should pop out fairly easily.

As cake recipes rise in sugar content, they become a bit stickier. For higher sugar content cakes, like rich chocolates or cakes with fruit baked with or in them, you should use a coating of cold butter before putting the batter in the pan. If your cakes still stick using the butter method, try a light dusting of flour after coating with cold butter.

Cutting wax paper in a circle the size of the bottom of the pan will work well, make sure that you have the shiny side up. 

Also, never lift a cake out of a pan. Allow to cool, place a plate over the top of the cake pan, invert, tap the bottom and the cake should release cleanly. 




 I was a visitor before I became a resident. If you held a gun to my head and made me complain about something, I would point out that the property taxes are pretty high on beachside...but that's it. 

Have fun! I hope you enjoyed your stay! 




 Remove the nails using a pull block. (A small shim or small block of wood that you put under the head of your hammer before using the claw to pull them out.) Assuming your walls are gypsum or plaster or drywall, get a tub of drywall joint compound, or wall spackle, and fill the hole. (If wood walls, use wood putty, if stone walls, you live in a cave, don't worry about it.) After drying time, sand, then repaint with match paint, or repaint wall.  




 Yep, there are fetishists of all types, but they fit my example, I think. 




 I went to see him in Tallahassee. Couple of good friends, a whole lotta whiskey, prepped for a great night.

Got there early, decent seats, smaller venue. Gonna be a good show.

Opening act comes out.

Blown away. It's The Derek Trucks Band. (Here's a favorite of mine, [I'd Rather be Blind, Crippled, and Crazy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSbcpLLadX0), it's got a 15 second no-skip ad, but it's the best live version of that song that I know of. L 6:22)

Stole the show. Outstanding performer, super fun show.

Almost forgot that Eric Johnson was up next. His show, while still amazing, was far less satisfactory for me compared to the discovery (for me) of this new thing.

Unfortunately, I suppose I left that night less of a fan Eric Johnson. I still like what he does a bunch, and this song is my favorite of his. 




 Code is 166 KA. That's a champion Katana then. 




 Yep, Scarborough, isn't it? My dad worked that one this year.
 




 I know, it was very confusing. I know it when I see it...lemme see.

I guess the biggest difference could be described as girls that *are* big versus girls that let themselves get *bigger*, hope that helps. 




 The word fat gets thrown around a lot. Maybe too much. 

I have loved me some big girls. I know big girls that are fabulous, and delicious, and amazing.

But fat, in my opinion, implies a controllable situation. Not big boned, not large women, not beg girls, but *sloppy* ones. Girls that don't take care of themselves. Girls that are big in the all the wrong ways. I don't know how to accurately describe the difference, but every man here knows what I'm talking about.

Short answer: Being a big girl may decrease your chances in the dating game, but in no way is going to keep you from being successful. Being *fat* as in not caring about your weight, accepting your bigness and piling on bad diet choices on top of it because it doesn't matter any more...that kind of fat, is a huge turnoff to me, and to most guys I think. 




 Restaurant style french toast? Hmmm. You need thick sliced white bread for one thing. The batter mix is the same, but the biggest difference is in the cooking. Most of these joints are cooking on flattop grills that keep a real consistent heat. Best results at home are going to be found with a flat top griddle. Barring that, try a pan way bigger than you need, cook one piece at a time, make sure that your pan is heated correctly, and hot before you add the toast. That should come close. 




 Good luck my friend. I'm well into my second year of attempting to quit. Two weeks ago, right about when you started quitting, I had well manicured nails, longer than I wanted them. (Got in the way of playing guitar, and I kept cutting myself with them!) I had a rough night, and without really thinking about it, chewed/gnawed/gnarled/ripped/bit/crunched every millimeter of them away.

This was probably the fourth or fifth time that this happened.

Take it day by day, and don't give up, because you will probably backslide a time or two. 

Seriously, good luck to you, and everyone else fighting this ridiculous habit. There is every reason in the world to not do this. So do it. Do it for cosmetic reasons, because we know what our fingers look like; that's why we hide them. Do it for the health of your hands. You're two weeks in, probably no infections or redness anymore? It's nice, isn't it? Keep at it. 




 Terrible story, poor little girl. First time this American has heard it. 

And it's also terrible that the reporter researching this could possibly have to face charges for this. Hope UK cops and judges aren't quite as dense as our US ones.

Have to point out a few things though. The "Gateway" drug comparison doesn't hold water. Many studies have shown that marijuana use does not necessarily lead to harder drug use. There is correlation, but no causation. The same is true about porn. Those that actively search for child porn have looked for other porn types before. This does not mean that the use or search of other types of porn will lead to violent child porn. 




 I fucked a one-legged redneck meth addict girl. Does that count? Cuz she couldn't. 




 If it is an open gear tuning machine, that might be possible. Are you sure that it's not just the string slipping? When you put the string on, wrap the first coil of the tightening process over the top of the string coming out of the hole in the tuning peg, this will keep the string taught on the peg. 




 Okay BrandNew...

What kind of guitar? Electric? Acoustic? Classical? 

You were having a hard time with the G *string* I assume. You say that the *thing* is clicking, let's assume you mean the tuning peg, or tuning machine. 

When it clicks, is it happening at the tuning peg at the top of the neck, or somewhere else?

And, did you just recently string it, or re-string  your guitar?
 




 There was still plenty of that, I was just lucky to know some very cool people. 




 Hope it's a good show. I've seen him twice.

First time, in Tampa, he was so damn drunk, they had to bring a stool for him to sit on, which he promptly fell off of. Show went about 40 minutes before Bob walked off. Terrible.

Second show, much later, was amazing, other than the fact that Bob wore some sort of metallic silver suit and the shine coming from the spots reflecting off of him made him damn near invisible, but an amazing show. 




 Another great song! This one resonated with me after I became a father for the first time.
 




 That one, and The Times They are A Changin are probably my favorite to play from his early career. Both are just timeless, and seem to speak to me at different times in my life in different ways. 




 I've played guitar for almost 30 years now. I picked up my Dad's Gibson one day out of curiousity, I might have been about 13 or 14. After a couple of weeks of just messing about with it, I decided I wanted to really learn how to play. 

I found two books in my Dad's music collection.

Mel Bay's Guide, and Bob Dylan's Best of Songbook for Guitar

I learned how to play guitar by learning how to play Blowin' in the Wind. And Maggie's Farm. And The Time's They Are a-Changin'. And Like a Rollin' Stone. And Chimes of Freedom. And Knockin' On Heaven's Door. And Don't Think Twice. And so many more.

So many high school parties, sitting around playing Bob Dylan, (and a whole lot of other 60's hits, as those were the songbooks that my Dad had...it was a dark time, before the internet.) and having singalongs with good friends. Everyone knew Dylan, it was what our parents were listening to at home. Good times with good friends, and I still play many of those songs when I'm feeling a little homesick.

Happy Birthday, Bob. Thanks. 




 I'm no scientist either, but the one thing that I know is that a lot of what we are getting exposed to science-wise, isn't science at all, but a massive disinformation campaign. Both sides of the argument are guilty of this, but it seems like the pro-GMO side is skewing the science more than the whole food movement.

My family and i are going to err on the side of caution on this one, and are trying to limit our exposure to GMOs until more is known. 




 Probably use the same strings.
 




 To replace the nut, you will have to remove the strings completely. Depending on the type of guitar, this may cause some tension problems. You may want to have this pro repaired if you're not handy at guitar tech. 




 To check a pan of ground beef, when you think that it is close to being done (after the fat looks clearer, if you can tell that), scoot everything over to one side of the pan, and try to get a temp reading in the middle of the pile. Generally, with loose meat like ground beef, assuming that you're stirring and mixing, if one part is at 165 f, then all of it should be at temp. 




 Thermometers. [Here's a handy-dandy chart for you](http://www.extraordinarybbq.com/bbqbasics/meat-temperatures/), (That previous sentence is a link to it.) Covers the basics. Do some more research on temperature charts, and you should be okeydokey for the future.
 




 You have to stop what you're doing. Someone is going to catch you, and they might just fuck you up for your trouble. 




 Why allow the tornado in the first place? When I hear people say things like this, I hear the unmentioned comment that somehow they deserved saving, while there was a reason that everyone else was not. What did those kids do to god to piss him off? Or their parents, maybe? And so many, that were so evil, that god decided to save you, instead of them? 




 I play a pretty heavily wooded course as my home course as well, and the hardest thing that I had to learn is to not overreach. Sometimes your best shot is the shot that gets you out of the woods. Too many times have a thunked the second tree trying to make a shot that was harded to make than my drive was in the first place! 




 Simple laughter. I looked like a hairy man in a dress. But, my friend is not feminine at all, and he's happy when he's CD. (I think he looks like a dude in a dress, nice dress and all, but just a dude in a dress, but I can see that he is happy, and that's what matters most.) 




 Comfortable older male here, hetero, but with many life experiences that touch on some of these issues, and I consider myself well in touch with my sexuality.

 What do you think about the idea of wearing girls clothes, like a dress?

Personnally, doesn't do much for me. I have, in the past, on rare occasions, worn women's underwear (at the request of a gf). I found it fun, but partially because I knew that if she asked me to wear her underwear it meant that we were going to get funky later.

 What would you think if you saw yourself in the mirror dressed like a girl, and what feelings does this invoke?

I have seen myself in full women's clothes. (Halloween a couple of times, a couple of other times for other reasons, none sexual in nature) It was odd, to see myself that way, but there were no negative feelings, neither did I feel comfortable. I am a burly male type, and mostly I felt that I made for a really ugly girl.

 What do you think about the idea of having a feminine body? (i.e. having breasts, long girly hair, and a curvy, womanly body)

I have long hair. I have (fantasized is not the right word, freethinking is what I call it, just imagining for the sake of imagining, sort of) about having breasts, or a vagina, and experiencing what that would be like, both on a day to day basis, and in a sexual context. I am happy with my body, and wouldn't trade it for anything, but I would like the chance to be someone else, or some other sex for a period of time.

 What do you think about the idea of being socially accepted as a girl? (i.e. whether or not your looks change, everyone thinks of you as a girl)

I would not be comfortable identifying as a woman. 

 What do you think about the idea of having a vagina?

As a said above, I have thought of this, and I would enjoy it briefly, but wouldn't trade Big Jim Thesselwine and the Bullzac Twins for a vagina, not permanently.

 Also, this is mostly irrelevant to gender, but what feelings does the idea of performing fellatio from a man or receiving anal sex invoke? (This question is directed to heterosexual men, but others are welcome to answer)

I don't find the idea of performing fellation on a man exciting at all. Receiving anal from a man, I've thought about before. (I'm a pro-prostate/anal hetero) As far as I can tell without expermenting, which I don't intend to do, I am interested in it, but not from a man. (I may try letting my wife experiment with a strap-on) 

Outside of this, and I hope these answers help you somehow, I would just say that you got to get in touch with you, stop worrying so much about labels, and find what makes you happy. I have a good friend who identifies male, is hetero, and is at his happiest in a dress. Whatever makes his day, makes me happy, and the people that truly care about you will be happy when you are happy as well. 




 Nope. Only fairies can help other things fly, and only fairies have full open control of their flight. Some other living creatures when exposed to fairy dust have been able to self control, but others seemed to just levitate. (I would cite sources, but this conversation is weird enough.) Objects simply get lifted. 

(I always did like bad girls) 




 I too suffer through many Tink movies with my daughter. 

1. Yes, fairies need pixie dust to fly, but other creatures and inanimate objects need pixie dust to fly as well, but really should be that they need pixie dust to *levitate*, but let's forgive them as we are adults watching a show meant for little girls.

2. I also noticed this. It is a glaring inconsistency in the canon, and will not be forgiven.

(also, I'm a Vidia fan myself.) 




 
A great book, and a very campy movie. Read it/watch it, it doesn't hold up to comparison, but a good piece of disaster fiction, either way.

 




 This is just great photoshop.
 









 The next time that you give her oral, when you're done, go up and kiss her, and tell her how much you enjoy doing that for her. One, the girls like that sort of thing, being told that you like doing stuff to them, and two she can experience her own taste/smell and maybe see that there is not much to worry about, and seeing you not minding it all over your face will reinforce for her how much it totally doesn't bother you. 




 Um, nothing. 

Ice should be safe, but you really don't want to be storing things up there. That can lead to all sorts of problems. If you're looking for feeling full for a period of time, get a small plug you can wear while being out and about. 




 Who would have won if nuclear war broke out between US and USSR?

 They make this. It's called superglue. Just a dab on the end of your fretting fingers, and it will give you some extra "callous". Remove with acetone (fingernail polish remover). DO NOT USE ACETONE WITH OPEN WOUNDS! (ouch) 




 Hmmm...might not be the best look for you, but maybe you should try that next time! Surprise her with nothing on but goggles and a snorkel.

In all seriousness, be careful of rubbing your eyes with your hands after sex. While all that juiciness is lots of fun, it does harbor some things that your eyes might not appreciate. 




 Um, I don't think you're doing it right? I don't usually use my eyes for anything more than looking....
 




 No prohibitions against ownership in the old west, but most towns would not let armed men ride down the high street. In town residents were sometimes restricted as to what they could own though.

It would be tough to come up with a statistical counter-argument to this graph, because I don't think you could do so without creating something as equally ambiguous. Gun crime is a very complex system, and much of the arguments being talked about rely on obscuring some of the real data, while heavily manipulating other parts of it. Maybe some research into background checks and how they affected gun violence? Everyone on either side of this argument is looking for the golden bullet point that will make the other side admit that they are wrong, but I don't think that it exists. The reality of gun violence has fingers in our education system, our social reality and values, our economic disparity, our culture, our history, and our emotions. 

[Here's an article that looks at the correlation between gun controls and gun violence from a different perspective.](http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2013/04/03/1811311/study-states-with-loose-gun-laws-have-higher-rates-of-gun-violence/)

[Here's an article from the Joyce Foundation that takes on a couple pro gun myths, with lots of links to backcheck and factcheck.](http://www.joycefdn.org/gunviolencemyths/)

[A bit off your topic, but a good article on the difference between causation and correlation relating to the gun debate.](http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/comment/2013/03/armed-correlations-gun-ownership-and-violence.html) 




 Okay. 

Let's start with the graph itself. What the hell is the left axis signifying? 2, 6, 8 what? Gun deaths per thousand? People who own guns? Number of alpacas in Maine?

From right to left...

The Wild West: First, the west was not so wild. Most towns had very strict gun controls. What we "know" of the wild west comes from movies. (Bonus: The gunfight at the OK corrall was about a gang that refused to be governed by gun laws!)

The Union Led Controls: This had a lot to do with reconstruction, not with gun violence. Many households were allowed to still have hunting rifles, but not military grade weapons. Doesn't really have too much to do with overall gun violence.

Prohibition: This makes sense, if you assume that the left axis actually means something. Violence was up during prohibition, and down after its repeal. But this violence was different than the overall homicide rate in the US now, again assuming that's what this graph is trying to represent. Big difference between machine gun Kelly taking out a rival gang and a husband shooting his wife for cheating.

Post JFK Controls: I don't know much about these.

War on Drugs: The increase makes sense, but why so much up and down? Is that related to the WoD at all? 

Carry laws: Curiously, these carry laws conincide with the general drop in crime that started in 1993. (The folks that wrote Freakonomics famously compared abortion rates with crime rates 20 years later and saw a very interesting correlation, look it up.) And not all states started issuing these permits. 

I call bullshit. Overall, I think it might have started as a real graph that contains real info, but to use it as a pro gun argument just because you can identify a few things on a timeline to defend your argument does not make a solid case. It certainly does not tell the whole story of gun violence. 




 I like my discs to be whatever color stands out from green/yellow/light brown...I play in Florida, and yellows and oranges and greens just disappear sometimes. As far as stamps, I'm a dyer, I like 'em not there!

 I think you already know the answer....take your man out and go buy new memories together. 




 Men are visually stimulated. That's why we like porn so much. It's our eyes that get turned on first. Additionally, it tells us a lot about you; how you enjoy to be pleasured, what works for you. We can use that...whether for information, or just to save to the spank bank. 




 Yes, yes you can. We call those Twice Crispy Treats!
 




 Mmmmmm....language porn.
 




 I work in foodservice, and I always wash...when I'm at work. The reasoning behind it does make sense. It's not just peeing on yourself; some bacteria and/or viruses can migrate. Either from your poo, or if you're a carrier.

Saying that, the idea of washing your hands when you're done in the bathroom is the idea of *everyone* washing their hands when they're done. A good way to help ensure that infectious diseases don't spread.

At home, no, I don't wash everytime I pee; only when I piss on myself. (And that's just a "grossness" issue, urine is sterile) I know I'm clean and disease free, and take care to remain so.

ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS wash after dumping. 




 Half rice crispies, and half other cereal. I've used fruity pebbles, cocoa pebbles, broken up cap'n crunch.

Also, coating in chocolate is good...laying a bed of chocolate down before you put your crispies in is better...then top with caramel. 




 I think that products like this don't appeal to me for two reasons. One, don't like to think about menstruation. The menses are a completely natural biological process that all women experience during their reproductive lives, but it is something that men experience second hand, and it is both mystical and clinical when described to us. We don't know how to deal with women menstruating as men, and as a society, we still view this part of a woman's life as dirty, or gross.

Secondly, living in a disposable society, the idea of washing these out and reusing them relates to that dirtiness aspect, and we have been trained our whole lives to view certain things as dirty, and disposables can take the stigma away, by never having to think about it.

I'm a dude, and yes I find that idea gross, but as a member of spaceship Earth, I know how detrimental disposables pads/tampons are to the environment, and if my wife wanted to use something like this, I would support it. Easier to deal with this than the [Mooncup](http://www.mooncup.co.uk/about-the-mooncup.html) anyway you look at it though!

 Frustrating....I'm looking for full results as well. Nothing yet. 




 Played regular Thursday club round this morning in pouring rain/wind.  




 I was a dedicated diet soda drinker. I stopped as part of my weight loss plan for this year. I've been eating better and excercising, but I assume that stopping the diet sodas was a big part of weight gain. Why? I lost so much weight at first, and fast, when I made these changes. And more importantly, the change in how I feel was amazing.

Saying that, if you're only drinking three a week, just stop. Find your caffeine in coffee, or tea, where you can control how much (and maybe more importantly *what kind of*) sugar you put in them. I personally would recommend staying away from diet sodas just because you don't want to find them becoming too large a part of your diet, but at the level that you're drinking, it shouldn't matter.  




 Lots of my favorites on there. 

Huck Finn - Mark Twain. Gotta love Twain. I don't think it's his best work, I like his essays and short stories, but he tells a tale well, and it's easy to read.

White Fang - London. The ultimate boys adventure book. I think that this one is a bit of a "young reader" i.e. not much to it, but a great read, great story.

Brave New World - Huxley. I think that this is a "must read" especially if you're politically minded at all. Put it on your list to read, but don't do it for this assignment unless you're looking to impress. Tough subject, very involved.

The World According to Garp - Irving. Another great story. A big read, but not impossible to communicate the story to a class. (Also a great movie, with Robin Williams in a serious role.)

They're really all good. I've read 90% of these recreationally, but I don't know what you're looking for for your assignment. Good luck, happy reading. 




 Having a great round at my local park, shooting well.

Throw a drive out of bounds left. Pissed. Working on my drive, been getting better, know I can do better. Throw a provisional, for practice.

One of my earliest memories is my dad being upset at me because I hadn't cleaned my toys up in the hallway, and him stomping on and breaking my Hess truck and trailer with real light up lights. (If you're over 35 you know what I'm talking about)

Dad and I have lots of other reasons why our relationship is garbage, but my mind always goes back to that.

Talk to your wife.  




 State the situation? I wouldn't be very comfortable going down on a girl at the dinner table, at her parents house, during Thanksgiving dinner...but if it's a sexytime situation, I'm a-goin down faster than the stock market two years ago.

My age now? When I did it the first time? How old she is? Very confused. This is something that I did in probably my second or third sexual encounter, almost 30 years ago now. And she would have to be older than 18. 




 It's a poem. Semi-famous in its day. It's actualy title is Old Pothead's Experimental Method. It's by Sam Abrams, a college professor and Fulbright scholar.

From Dr. Lester Grinspoons' blog:

Sam Abrams has been a Fulbright Professor of American Literature at the University of Athens and currently is Professor of Language and Literature in the College of Liberal Arts, Rochester Institute of Technology. He dropped out of academia from 1968 to 1978, during which time he was a film writer, a communal organic farmer, a casual longshoreman, a union laborer, and a public relations flack: he considers that of these, the farming was the best learning experience.

The poem was originally published in The Old Pothead Poems.

Here's his [wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_abrams) 




 I've recently read an article about birthgasms here on reddit. Have you experienced this, and is it difficult for women to talk about when it happens? 




 Doo doo do do do. 




 Yeah, thanks, no spell check. I'm lost without it. 




 This might be part of the phenomenom as well. Testing has improved greatly over the last twenty-five years or so and we're better able to identify allergies that aren't of the *eat a peanut and die* flavor. 




 We take allergy awareness very serious in our restaurants. We have a clientele made up of mostly old folks, who are in the danger zone when it comes to food bourne illnesses and allergies. I understand making it idiot proof on the menus to some degree, but when a case of cashews comes in the back door to be stocked and I see a big sticker that says Warning: CONTAINS NUTS it makes me wonder what sort of stupidity had to happen to make the manufacturer have to put that on there.  




 I've done a lot of reading on this, and fingers point to everything under the sun. Personnally I believe that there is a connection between food additives and food allergies. There is little to no direct evidence showing this, but food allergies have grown in our society right along with the massive increase of artificial colorings and flavorings, with the increase of steriod and antibiotic use, and the increased reliance on pesticides/herbicides in our industrial farming.

Exposure, or lack of exposure, may be an issue as well, as many children that develop food allergies come from homes that eat a diet heavy in processed foods, so that the exposure that they do get to the common allergens (wheat/gluten, soy, dairy, eggs, fish/shellfish, and treenuts) are processed so much. Again, there is little evidence, or studies, that point to this as a cause.

I don't have the link, but I did read about a study that showed that children who were fed a whole food diet were the most unlikely to form any food allergies at all, and when the mother consumed a whole foods diet as well, the chance of food allergies became almost nil. 

It's incredibly difficult to get good information about our food anymore. The foxes are running the henhouse as it were, with the government authorities who are in charge of making sure our food is safe, true, and healthful are run by industry executives across the board. There is less monitoring in our food service manufacturing now than at any time since the early 1970's, and that directly correlates with the increase in food bourne illnesses that have sickened and killed people in these last 40 years.

 




 I work in the foodservice industry, and am in charge of producing allergy information menus for our restaurants. Food allergies are growing in leaps and bounds, and it's important to get correct information to our customers so that they can avoid allergens, and so that we can avoid lawsuits.

Saying that, it makes me crazy to have to point out that a peanut butter and jelly sandwich contains nuts. 

I understand pointing out hidden gluten, or eggs, or shellfish in recipes that the customer might not automatically assume were there, but if you have a nut allergy, then "Don't eat nuts!" seems like pretty good advice. Do you really need a warning? 




 Bastards. Assuming the story checks out that is. If it was me, I would be turning on Daddy Kick Ass Power, and probably be going to jail in addition to losing my kid. I hope they get out of this without too much more nonsense. 




 Go for it. The wife and I enjoy that one, gives the female a feeling of control, of dominance, she can grab my head, twist my ears, and fuck my face for a change! 




 He's asking because he wants you to do it...so he doesn't have a problem with it. He obviously finds you sexy and attractive....so who's judging you but you?

Turn the lights out, or compromise; through a leg up on the couch and put him to work. 




 No, because I've done it. There's so many benefits from ideas like these. Spices things up for sure, shows an adventurous side, and the learning, if you can keep your head and pay attention, is invaluable. 




 You need to ask your woman, not Reddit. 

Go to her. Now. Tell her hot fuckin' hot it was to watch her finish herself off. Tell her that whenever she's ready and comfortable that you would like to pay more attention to her masturbating so you could see what it is that she likes. Follow through. Take fuckin' notes. 

Sex is a strange thing; most of us can do it, but only a few of us take the time to get really freakin' good at it. 




 I make most of my decisions based on human interaction with a possible employee, but adding what I can find online can help me get a better overall picture of the person that I'm talking to, and direct some questions that might get them to open up about themselves. 

I have once in the past confused two people because of similar names, but most of the time I do the online check almost immediately after talking to someone so I can use all the info that I have to make sure that I'm stalking the right person.

I don't agree that google searching in this useage is because of cowardice, but more because we live in a world where people share more of themselves online than when in person, especially with a stranger. Stalking out their digital profile is no substitute for social interaction, but it is a wealth of information when you're trying to make a decision about someone that you just met.

 




 I caught that, and appreciate it.  




 I didn't say that, but I would look to see if I could infer what your recreational drug of choice would be. Big difference between a pothead and a meth-head. 




 It wouldn't be too hard to put the two together...but I'm also not currently looking for a job! I would delete a whole lot of Reddit and Facebook and others first thing before beginning a job search.  




 That is an issue. Hard to prove though, unless the employer is stupid enough to either admit that they check FB as part of the decision making process, or something equally as stupid...admitting that they don't hire pregnant atheist muslims. 




 I keep a "real name" social media site, and a real one for my real friends. Makes things a little easier, unless I forget to give out the right one to the wrong person. 




 It's not always easy. But most of the time I get an applicants social # or email as well, adn that can narrow things down as well. Middle names help with common names as well, so does knowing how to use Facebooks terrible search function. 




 That's why I like it here. 




 Manson is actually a well-spoken and intelligent guy. Look up some of his interviews; he's far more than his public persona. Hate his music, but I think I would have a nice time chatting with him.

The Biebs, however, I get the impression that he's as one dimesional as it gets without being in geometry class. I don't think he has a thing to offer anyone, outside of his inevitable dissapperance. 




 I'm surprised when someone doesn't have a facebook page, or when I can't find one (nicknames or fake names on page) but a simple google search gives me a wealth of information to sift through. When you fill out your app, I have your full name (check arrest records, check for other social media sites), I have your address (check out where you live to get an idea of your previous income and current financial situation), and I have your past employers (google search employees name plus previous employer can sometimes turn up any positive or negative feedback, either posted by the applicant, or by a supervisor, coworker, or customer). 

You'd be surprised how much you can find out. Try it on yourself, or a friend that you have that info on, and see what's public out there. I do, once every couple of months, just to see what my digital profile is like. 




 This is how and why terrorism works. As soon as I saw the bombs go off my first thought was for the victims, but immediately following was concern about how my government was going to react.

Though to be true to form, once we found out that the bombers were Chechen, we should have invaded Switzerland. 




 Add alliteration:

"Soon I'll be stopping *by* to grab my things and say good*bye*" 




 Were they weighing themselves before and after puking? Seeing how many pounds of sex toys they could insert at once? You throw confusing parties....I like that. 




 As an employer, I would never ask for your fb password. But, you should know that I absolutely will check your facebook when considering you for a position. Protect yourself! When looking for a job, ensure that your profile is set to private, and that I can't see photos of you using illegal drugs, complaining about how messed up your financial situation is, or comments that show you are a racist/sexist/militant/etc. 




 Welcome to the 21st century. Douche. Change your handle, you're giving atheists a bad name. 




 Start looking at flavor wheels.

Did a quick google image search on [flavor wheel](https://www.google.com/search?q=flavor+wheels safe=off hl=en tbm=isch tbo=u source=univ sa=X ei=gq5yUfWcIoiK9QTIyoCQAg ved=0CDgQsAQ biw=1680 bih=923#imgrc=_) just to show how much information is available out there to you. Do some experimentation with searching (your ingredients) flavor wheel. It's a handy tool, and good for inspiration as well. 




 I've read Borimi's comments on this, which are well thought out and better written than my response. What I mean by not so much about slavery might have been better said as not only or not specifically about slavery. Bormimi puts it quite well when he says "slavery wasn't the spark which started the war, it is the overwhelming common denominator underlying the factors which caused the war."

I don't think that Lincoln used slavery as *only* a foreign policy tool, but it certainly was used that way. 

I agree totally that any argument that you have about the Civil War are going to be wrapped up in the cloak of slavery, the states rights issue was about the states individual rights to have slaves or not. When I hear people say that the Civil War was about slavery, I envision Lincoln as some sort of super hero swooping in to free the slaves, and I don't think that history really bears that out. This could easily degenerate into an argument (It's **State's Rights!!**, no, it's the **State's rights to keep slaves!!**) but I just wanted to express that slavery wasn't the *reason*, but obviously it was the underlying current that this particular piece of history swims in.


 




 I thought they were all good ones.

 




 Justification in war is generally decided by the victors, who often write the history.

Slavery. Not so much. Lincoln believed that blacks should have equal rights, even though he was on record as saying that he believed they were lesser beings than whites. Short answer? Slavery was a tool that was used by Lincoln and his White House when trying to prevent foreign powers getting involved in the Civil War. Other countries had already outlawed or curtailed slavery throughout most of the industrialized world, and by making the war about slavery, other countries had to consider how they would be perceived supporting a rebellion that was about the right to keep slaves. The civil war was started in ideation because the states wanted to have self-determination, while the Fed Gov't felt that it could overrun states rights in certain instances, *such as slavery*.



Preserving the Union was far more important than slavery itself. Preserving the Union might as well have been political code for 1, I'm not gonna go down as the president that lost the south, and 2, we can't exist comfortably without the food and materiel that the South provides. (Textiles, tobacco, raw cotton, and many foodstuffs.) The industrial North would have to import all those things from what would become a foreign country.

Let's use Syria as an example. It doesn't matter as much what happens during the war as the result. If Assad wins, and continues his reign, what will be remembered a hundred years from know is how a brave and beleagured Assad was able to hold off the rebel hourdes and defend his country against those that wished it harm. If the rebels win....history will be theirs to define. 




 Own it. It's yours. Especially if you're good at it. Bassists and guitarists are a dime a dozen (and you get two bassists free with any purchase) but a banjo picker that knows what he's doing is worth a damn or two. 




 It's perfectly fine as is, because it is. This man likes to see that chocolate starfish standing out from the rest of your buttskin. No woman should want to take that simple pleasure away from us. In fact, why don't you look into dyeing Sauron's eye a darker color! Make your balloon knot a dark purple! Embrace your puckered starfish! Celebrate your ham flower! Love your rusty bullet hole!

 Had a lady at one of the high-tops near the bar tonight. Ordered a Stoli and water. Complained about it "not tasting right". Shot on over to do my thing, talked to her, the only thing she could say is that it "just didn't taste right". So I go to the bar and have the 'tender make me another one, stood right there and saw it get made. Took it over to the table and presented it to the customer. She says that it tastes just like the last one!

I tell the lady that I stood there and saw it get made, and that I was sure that it was Stoli and water. 

She says that she's had them before, and it doesn't taste like she remembers.

After mentally thowing my hands in the air, I restated that I was sure that it was Stoli and water, just like she ordered...

She asked me what flavor of Stoli that I used. 




 Late tonight, had a trio of old white folks walking out the door just as an african-american couple walked in. Little old lady, about 80, maybe five feet tall, walks right up to the black fella, probably 6'8, grabs his belly and tells him "You look just like my son!" Without explaining why this makes sense, they ask him (of course) if he played basketball. Turns out he played for UCF, and the litle old lady says that her son also played for UCF, years earlier than this guy would have been in school. After chatting basketball for a minute or two more, they went their seperate ways, and I caught the eye of the big guy, and he kinda rolled his eyes at me. The little old lady turns to her husband as they walk out the door and says...

"6'8 and he played power forward? He's fulla shit!"

Surreal.
 









 Sex outside the bedroom can be very cool. The wifey and I are all middle aged and shit and still like gettin' it on in sketchy semi-public places. We have a date with a park down the road next Monday afternoon actually....gonna do some "bird watchin'".  




 Maybe by his room-mate? Either way, that's one hell of a walk of shame. 




 Just a quick run like that, might be best to put an ad in our [local newspaper want ads](http://creative.news-journalonline.com/classified/) or in our local trashrag, [the Pennysaver](http://www.floridapennysavers.com/new_smyrna_beach/). Short of that, the only service that I know of that you could possibly use are more of a booze cruise/charter boats that are gonna run 50-100 bucks, and stay out for a few hours. 




 Fixing is my thing, and the additional income could come from purchasing the rental property...but I see what you're saying. Can't make a play on it for lack of funds....love my place, hate to think about leaving. 




 We've got another six months or so on our current lease, and the landlord situation is a little, let's say unprofessional. Landlord that we deal with has sold the property previously, to a family member, who does not live in town. Current landlord makes all the decisions, and is the kind of guy that would work with emotion first, and economics second...having another lease drawn wouldn't be a big deal, I think, as long as the sale wasn't imminent.

I didn't figure I could do anything to try and secure the property, but I would be a dope for not asking!

Want to get this figured out so that we can make long term plans. Doing credit counseling/building up our credit score...we do have a long term plan to buy, we just are worried about how soon we may have to move, and what that will do to our finances.

Thanks for replying! 




 San Marino burned down or something, didn't it? The new Malibu condo is there, or next door? 




 There's an encampment behind the Indian River plaza, but other than that, don't really see them like I see them on Canal. 




 We just found out that our landlord is putting our building up for sale. It's a three unit condo, beachside, 1650 sqft or so per, 3/2, brick and mortar. Our landlord has been very friendly for us, keeping us in our unit for less (way less) than market value. (We pay 1k/mth, going rate should be 1500 or so, if not higher.) 

We're concerned with new owners coming in, where we live is developing and growing, and we're just not sure what our plans, long and short term, should be.

So, a couple things you guys could answer for us?

Short term: Three unit, priced at 400K. Property is zoned res only. Possible income about 4500/mth or so. How quick is this thing gonna sell. I know you don't have crystal balls over there, and the market in FL is rebounding, but still shaky, but does this sound like a clearance sale to you, or are we going to have a minute before we have to worry about it selling?

Mid Term: What are my rights as a renter? Assuming this place does sell, how long do I have before the new landlords can demand higher rents, or demand we vacate? Do they purchase any lease agreements when they purchase the property? Meaning, do they have to honor a lease signed by the previous owner? (This is important, our landlord is *very* cool, and if our plans needed to include us staying there, he could set us up with a lease for three or five years, at our rate, with no fee for early vacating.)

Long term: What's our next step? Single wage earner, paycheck to paycheck, minimal savings, minimal credit history. Is it even worth it to start looking for a home to buy, or should we be looking at another rental? (Info: Income (on paper) 40k/yr, own investment property only worth about 10k, about 5k in savings currently, both wife and I have *ahem, questionalble credit....(default credit card - her, and student loans - me.))

Thanks in advance for anything you guys can suggest to ease our minds and help us plan our future! And, I hesitate to ask because it seems so far fetched, but is there something like a Small Business Loan that I could get hold of (if I could even qualify for such a thing) and make a play at the property ourselves? 




 Thank you!! This is why I reddit! 




 Interesting place. A wide spot on the road....I-75, just north of Tampa. Was hitching out of Tallahassee one summer, and got picked up outside Lutz by a dude and his family in a short bus that had been upconverted to a camper bus. Spent the whole hour and a half ride into St. Pete listening to this dude explain how magic crystals could be ground up, dropped from planes into the atmosphere, and that would prevent hurricanes from ever forming again. He had some very convincing pictures, drawn in pencil on notebook paper, that explained how it worked. He was very adamant about how it needed to happen, but it never was going to...."because of the niggers and the gays."
A ride I was glad I was still alive to see the end of. I made eye contact with the wife on my way off the bus, and I couldn't tell if I saw pity for me, either because I had to talk to her crazy old man, or because I didn't understand how magic crystals worked, or maybe, just maybe, a pleading look, begging for help, some rescue unlooked and unhoped for from her madman of a husband.

She haunts my dreams. 




 Shhhhh! I'm trying to get more cool people to come to Florida! 

Been through Polk. It's no different than most of middle FL. Ever been to Lutz? 




 Yeah, that's gonna be hard to do. Depends on what kind of frisbee you want to do. Simple recreational frisbee easier than a regulation Ultimate or Disc golf disc. (Because of the plastic blends used in manufacture.)  




 Yeah, no career as a travel agent for me. 




 It's basically all the parts of FL that aren't advertised. Orlando? Crack heads, murder capital of FL. Tampa/St. Pete? Meth. Robbery. Rape. Clearwater Beach? Ought to call it hypodermic beach, also the headquarters of Scientology. Panama City Beach? The beach is nice, the rest of the panhandle is backwards southern rednecks. Miami? They'll eat your face off, but only *after* they rape you.  




 Some parts of it aren't that bad. No, really. 




 English and spanish, from FL. 




 Post here...lots of new dads, and second and third dads here. Also, get your wife a copy of What to Expect When You're Expecting, and read it yourself. Great book, very informative. 




 What's the design? (How difficult?) Single color, or mutliple? 




 I'm a rocks drinker. A good whiskey, poured over ice, swirled, allowed to sit just a minute or two before enjoying, is a delight. I personally don't "add" any water, other than my melty ice. 




 Ahhh, rape-dancing. It was very popular in my high school. 




 Our home course is short, technical one. We warm up on 18, no practice baskets. Practice upshots from the basket at 18 to the basket on hole 9...got to talking to some club members, and we talked about doing a day where we shoot from the previous hole's basket on to the next hole. (Hole out 1, and then shoot from that spot for 2, and so on.) Would work for our course, and sounds like a lot of fun. We may try it soon. 




 If there's a downside to playing disc golf in FL, besides the unbearable heat, how much water you have to carry, bugs, spiders, alligators, and wind/rain/hurricanes, it's that you have some real interesting ground cover colors....I throw a lot of white and black and blue discs to make sure I can see them in the green, greenish yellow, yellow, brownish yellow and brown we play in.
 




 All year disc golf in FL...but getting ready for windy spring early summer with this:

Driver(s):

171g Champ Beast (beat in, forearm go to disc. Reaching just shy of 300 with this.)

172g Champ Beast (softer beat in, back hand control disc. Right about 300')

177g Champ Beast (newest, throwin in the wind. Can boom this one a bit further.)

177g River (glide like an eagle, headwind or tailwind. Love this disc. Can hit 275-300')

178g Amp (newest disc, not sure if right for my windy bag)

Mids:

175g Champ Shark (Beat in, forearm approach and finesse disc)

180g Champ Shark (softer beat in, for shot shaping and longer approaches)

Putts:

2X Anodes, 180 and 178 




 That, sir, is fuckin' creepy.
 




 I whistle, happy tunes, and smile and say hi to everyone that I see....generally helps. But, I still get "the look" every now and again. 




 I hope so, it's getting re-reported too much. 




 It was announced today that Andrew Lincoln may be quitting the show. That might change a few things.

 Married three years, together 10 more.

I would at least consider it, and talk to her about it. The issue wouldn't necessarily be sex, but I would want to know that there were some emotional protections in place. (Not worried about her fuckin' somebody else as I am her fallin' in love with somebody else.) 




 When you want your haircut, you go to the barber.

When you want your teeth cleaned, you go to the dentist.

When you want your balls drained, why on earth wouldn't you go to a professional?

And you had to go to the barber the first time, and you were probably scared then. You had to go to the dentist the first time, and that was probably scary, too.

Do what feels right for you. But don't cloud up this decision with a lot of nonsense. Do it if you want. Don't if you don't. Whoever she is, she's done this before. She'll be gentle. And understanding, and won't make fun of you.

My opinion? I lost my virginity to a girl just a year older than me that (if it's even possible) knew less about sex than I did. The idea of your first time being special is mostly a myth. It's usually a misinformed fumbling occasion marked by unneeded embarassment and stickyness.

 




 For sure. 




 Nowhere near that fast, but a fun story.

I had been playing with a couple people on and off, shitty bar gigs, whatever. Didn't work out, drifted, lost contact.

My friend (percussionist) and I moved, out of state for work and school.

We ended up working at the same shithole restaurant, and one night after work, we're sitting around outside, having a ...smoke, and my friend says fuck it, we should start a band. 

Work sucks, extra money doesn't, but we laughed it off, we don't know anybody in town, blah blah blah. 

My buddy (percussionist) and I (singer/songwriter/guitar) are catching a ride home that night with this dude, and dude says we have to stop by his place to ...have a smoke.

We roll into his apartment, and there is this red-headed fuck sleeping on the couch. He wakes up when he hears us moving around in the kitchen, and it's my buddy from the other state (lead guitar) that we haven't seen in about two years.

First words outta his mouth? We need to start a band.

We jam a few times, nothing really, and start thinking about finding a bass player. We get this guy over, and he's some kind of jazz/fusion guy that can't fit with southern progrock, and after deciding he ain't working, my buddy (lead guitar) says that he thinks he know someone. 

Give him a call, he lives two streets over from the band house. He says he knows a drummer. They both come over.

We all work on a jam, hits that sweet spot where you can feel it right, and for the next six years we make beautiful music together, scorching the scene in our little town.

Serendipity was considered for a band name. 




 I did not even consider smart-people only orgies. I may just start organizing those, and to hell with the birth control. 




 Birth Control in the water.

You gotta have a license to fish, but anybody with a vagina and a donor can have a kid?

In the face of severe overpopulation just a generation or two away, and idea like this could be revolutionary.

Consider that Russian scientists have announced that they may be able to "curtail againg" by 2050 or so, and most scientists agree that the human lifespan is going to skyrocket in the next 100 years or so.

Consider that in many parts of the world, absolutely no care is given to our genetics. Any body can breed. Maybe this isn't the best idea? Given that many of our best and brightest are too busy to start families, and it's the portion of our society that least needs to be breeding that seems to be the most productive at it.

Birth Control in the water. Go to the doctor, get a physical, get screened for genetic diseases, get a license, go to the pharmacy, take a pill that makes you fertile, have children.

The singlemost large problem with this idea is that some government has to be in charge of this, and that's almost never a good idea. But something has to be done, or not only will we overpopulate, we will be surrounded by the worst that society has to offer us. 




 It's not gonna make you feel any better about almost eating that, but that's a piece of common dish room scrubby made of steel. Real common for those to end up in pots and pans, that are then used for cooking, and the piece of metal makes it into your food. Our restaurant does not allow them any longer for that reason. 




 There was a point where I wanted to like Merle, I really did. He came close to some kind of redemption...but even there at the end I didn't trust him...I think that he might have been doing what he was doing just to gain cache with Rick's group, or maybe I'm just jaded as hell. 




 Yeah, that'll happen. 




 Such a powerful scence, but I for one am glad to see Merle gone.
 




 One of my favorite places...lol. Tacos carnitas for the win...shitty wine based margaritas, though. The family hits that place up once a month or so...I'm a chef/manager, so I like to eat at home as often as possible. :) One of the best joints on beachside, and just a bit down the road from my house.  




 In between the bikers and the breakers (Spring break starts on the heels of bike week) this is the least favorite time of year here for me. Another month or so, and things get nice around here. Good summer crowd, but they stick to the beach, and the bars are crowded, but not with assholes, ya know? Just interesting folks. Next to early fall (when everyone goes home and the town is empty) summer is my favorite time of year here. 




 Norwood's is still there. I've been here a bit, and I don't know the San Marino at all. You wouldn't recognize beachside...condos, condos as far as the eye can see...almost all the way down to Canaveral National Seashore. 
 




 You should have been here for the Casey Anthony nonsense....you would have loved it, and forgive me for my yankee comment. Most transplants are from up north, I just get used to calling 'em all yankees. 

As far as Warnos goes, did you see the Discovery Channel mini-doc on that case? The woman who played Wornos is the wife of one of my good friends and ex-employees, and is also a retired *original* American Gladiator!

Bike week is pure hell for most of us down here. Fake ass bikers with creases in their leathers, taking a vacation from their podiatrist practice to come play big boy in my little town...most of them don't know how to drive well anyway...cruisin' at three in the morning, knowing that they're the same people calling the cops when someone in their neighborhood is playing their radio too loud at nine at night...sheesh. Rant over 




 Biased opinion for sure, but they really are the best steaks in town. Real wood grill, imported mesquite from TX, nice bar, best happy hour in town, it's not a bad place.  The NSB can be great. It gets better when all the (no offense...) yankees go home. (Don't worry, give it a few weeks and you'll be on island time too.) 




 Okay...never go to the Outback again...keep going down the road to the Publix plaza on the right hand side. There's a local steakhouse there. (Full disclaimer: I work there...it's a job, so I hate it, but it really is the best steak in town.) Called the New Smyrna Steakhouse. Enjoy! 




 Careful, or you'll get to watch that crane eat those lizards! Not the best thing before breakfast! Manatee is awesome, we take the kids there every now and again. (We're true islanders...we generally don't come across the bridges if we don't have to...lol). On your cruise down Canal, just off Canal St on Sams Rd is the NSB historical museum. If you're into that sort of thing it's a neat little place with some history about our groovy little town. 




 Canal St. can be alright. Check out Ruth's for breakfast...skip it for lunch. (Ruthies is on the west end of canal...don't know which side you're on.) Big Joe's on the corner of Dixie Hwy and Canal for the best subs in town, or check out Maloney's for lunch and cold beer. (Ask for Michelle, tell her Joe sent ya) Feel free to PM me for anything NSB related....I love our little beach town. I've been here less than a decade, but I've grown to love this place, and know it well. 




 Welcome! Glad to have another Redditor in the NSB. Bums in your yard? Should have chosen beachside!

Cool things to do in NSB? Meh... Drive on the beach, do it at least once, then never do it again, it'll wreck your car.

Check out the lighthouse at Ponce Inlet. Long drive, small admission, worth it for the view.

South end of the island is part of Canaveral Natl Seashore. Go there. It's stunning.

Lots of park, and outside stuffs to do. I second Beachside Tavern for good shows. Cheap, and cold, beers too. 




 That's exactly what's its like. The chopstick is the structure to support all the hot glue. Shaping the glue is more like layering the glue. Adding in seperate layers to get the shapes that you want. It's easier than it sounds...I've made a fairy one for my five  year old girl, and a wizard one for my eight year old boy. Super easy, done in an evening, and I made hand-made paper boxes for them as well. 




 Prepare to be awesome, Dad.

Homemade Magic Wand/Princess Wand/Fairy Wand/Wizard Wand

You will need:

* Wooden chopsticks, like from the chinese takeout.

* A glue gun. Glue too.

* Spray paint. Pink, green, yellow, brown, you know.

* Sparkly shit. Glitter, ribbon, beads.

* Just a little bit of time.

Break off your chopsticks so you only have one. Get yer glue gun, and start gluing. What you need to do here is use the glue to shape the chopstick into a wand shape. Nice and thick on one end for little hands, dull down the sharpness of the skinny end so nobody loses an eye. Use beads or broken pieces of the other chopstick to help this shaping. Just build glue on top of glue until you get the look you want. (Pro-tip: Using wax paper, or latex gloves, you can mold the glue. But only right in between it being magma hot and completely set.) Once you get a shape that you're happy with, get your spray paint on, hit it with a couple of colors, make it bright, make it right. Brown for wizards/witches, pink and green for fairies and princesses. Get sparkly. Sprinkle glitter on that thang while it's still spray paint wet. Tie a ribbon around that thing. Personalize, accesorize, right? Go the extra mile and box it up all fancy-like, and prepare for the awesomeness of "Thank you Daddy!"

 




 Male in 10+ LTR.

She does if I ask. Not a huge thing for me, I prefer her nekkid. But I do like it when she does. Would like it more if it was spontaneous from her end, but if it's something that you want, don't just ask for it, talk to your girl and see how she feels about it, tell her how you feel about it, and see what happens. 




 I don't need it bald, but as a frequent giver of oral, I really appreciate when the girls keep everything neat and trim and out of my way...makes my life just a little bit easier. I can deal with hairy, I just prefer not having to. Bald is porn hot, but not necessary all the time. 




 Here in the US, cilantro refers to the leaves of the plant, while coriander generally refers to the ground up seeds of the same plant. Two very different flavors in the kitchen.  




 Real books will always have a place on my shelf, and I assume that there are a lot of other people that feel the same way.

What I would like to see in the future is a serious on-demand printing based book economy....where we don't have to choose from the few books that the publishers feel like producing, but can audition books online, and purchase printed copies of the books that we like, books that we have loved and lost, and eliminate the idea of a book ever being "out of print." 




 Girl is trying to do something, good for her, I ain't gonna hate. 




 Yep. Don't use RIT. They changed their formula a bit ago, and it no longer works on plastics. (Though, I have had some success in darkening colors with black RIT...). 

Find Jacquard iDye poly fabric dye. You can find it in Micheal's or online. Mix one pack with one quart of water, heat to boiling, let cool until you can hold your hands on the pot without hurting yourself, and dye away. Do not use the color intesifier that comes with the dye. 

Also, check out [the forums on DGCourseReview.com.](http://www.dgcoursereview.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=25) Plenty of info there.

 There are two sides to studying how to be a pick-up artist. 

The first side are those men that use those tools to bed women indiscriminately. They're in it for the game, for the conquer, and for the nookie. Many of them are the kind of guys that aren't going to call you in the morning; you are just another score to them.

But there's another side to studying how to be ultra-confident around women. It's for those of us that aren't. Many men have the tools to be a good partner to women whether it's for the long term, or just the long night, but they don't know how to act around the opposite sex, or lack the confidence in themselves to be that suave guy that we're all told we're supposed to be.

Studying the art of the pick up can help those kind of men show women that they are more than the quiet guy in the corner, making eyes at the hottie 'cross the way; it can help them be interesting, to conquer the art of small talk, and break down the walls between strangers that keep them from becoming closer.

tldr? Don't hate the player, hate the game. 




 I had a good friend while I was living in a university town. She was finishing her Master's and working at the restaurant that I ran.

I had many enjoyable evenings talking to her about politics, the future of genetics (her field of study), and general sciency stuff. She was a very intelligent, very well spoken young lady.

Until the men came around.

I had no interest in her, she none in me, purely friends, but the way that she would act when men she was interested in made it very difficult to remain friends with her. She could go from an intelligent discourse on current events, to that high-pitched-voice, flounce-my-hair play stupid bullshit that so many young women seem to employ.

I talked about it with her one time, and she felt that many men felt threatened by how smart she was. I responded that I thought she was smarter than that, and that the only men threatened by smart women are dumb men.

We've gone our seperate ways since, and I still see her on FB occiasionally, and it doesn't seem like much has changed. She's working on her Doctoral at another university, and her comments/posts seems to show that her intelligence has only grown, while the pictures that she posts, and the FB friends that she keeps reinforce that "dumb girl" facade.

tl;dr smart girls acting dumb to get beefneck men that will never respect a strong intelligent woman.

 [Nope. It was 'shooped for a Nokia comercial](http://www.snopes.com/photos/advertisements/pingpong.asp) 



















 If this is a run and gun disaster, I'm fucked. I'm at work right now, and in my pockets are two sets of keys, one small knife, a pack of smokes, a lighter, a wee bit of smoke, a wallet with about 35 bucks, and a pen.

The only useful things on my person right now would be my lighter, my small knife, and my shoelaces. I don't know how long I could last with those.

If this was a hunker down kind of scenario though, I'd be in pretty good shape. I work in a restaurant that cooks with a wood fire. Plenty of food, the ability to cook most of it off if the power fails, access to knives, fresh water, and supplies like a well stocked first aid kit. Not a bad place to be if things went to hell. 














 After recognizing some serious errors in my game (lack of backhand, lack of distance, etc.) I dumbed down my bag as well.

* 3 Champ Beast
* 2 Champ Shark
* MVP Amp
* Lat 64 River
* 2 MVP Anodes

Super improvement once I gave myself over to understanding what I should be able to do with my discs and letting myself get to the point where I could do those things.

Easily breaking the 300' wall with my Beasts now, reliable upshots with my Sharks, putting well from 30' with the Anodes. Got some room to add a few things, thinking about switching in a Shark3, and I want to test throw a blizzard Beast a couple times before I add that in to the mix as well. 

I recommended it my club, and scores have been improving everywhere. I highly recommend it. Tourney bags, and tourney amount of discs, are for tourney pros, not us ams.

 I can't speak about events I haven't been too, but the one's that I have been too are about fun, and community, and beer, and bbq, and discgolf. We had a couple of real new guys in our group, and we didn't care; we spent time working on their form and talking about the game instead. 

If you're thinking about doing it, do it. You won't regret it. They're fun. 




 Nope. Amateur event.

Depending on event, you are supplied discs, and it's one shot and done. If you get an ace, you score one point, if you don't, you don't.

Most points at the end win.

 No, just old person shaped. Would've been better if she was huge, right? 




 It did cross my mind.... 




 Right? I even told her that after everything got chilled out. Their good, but take your time, you can always bring some home!
 




 You would think so, but our standard customer might be aware that the internet exists, but that's about it. Old people, they smell funny, and don't chew their food, apparently. 




 I was walking food to the table next to them. She was getting up, and wheezing hard. I heard it, and went over to check on her, and right as I got to her she inhaled and I heard it block. She didn't do the traditional hands to the neck sign, but at that point you could see the panic. After her throat cleared, she was wheezing hard and claiming to still be choking, but after talking her down and getting her calm, she was alright.

Fukin' pork chops. They're good, but slow down! 




 Heimlich maneuver. Know it. You might need it.


Old lady out in FOH, chokes on a too-big piece of pork chop. Fully choking, customers standing around like dull eyed cattle. Jump in, three thrusts, out shoots the chop, everybody's happy. 














 As in using it as a poaching liquid? Absolutely safe. Right way to go about there. 




 No, not the meat (other than different bacteria or microbes to deal with)

The marinade itself can be made safe with application of heat over a period of time. But before heating, contact with marinade with kitchen implements, hands, spills on counter, etc are all dangers.

EX: You use a spoon to stir the marinade, and lay it on a counter. You cook the marinade, at temp, over time, and make it safe. You sit it aside as you plate your food, and then use that same spoon to dish the marinade/sauce. You have now re-introduced bacteria and microbes into your food.

This is a danger in all cooking, the difference here is that the marinade allows the bacteria to grow quickly, so you have a higher concentration of bacteria/microbes to deal with, making any accidental cross contamination possibly dangerous. 




 The danger here is that even under refrigeration, the microbes will continue to reproduce. Like I said, safe if heated correctly, but dangerous because of the introduction of liquid media. 

The chicken has the slamminella naturally. As the bird is butchered, it gets spread about. Under refrigeration the salmonella will continue to reproduce, slowly, but mostly on the surface. When introduced into a liquid, you've given them room, and energy (food), and invited them to turn it up a notch.

It will still grow slowly under refrigeration, but it will still grow.

You can do it, but the danger here is cross contamination. A dirty spoon, a dirty knife, your hands, anything that comes in contact with the marinade that isn't heated or sanitized is going to allow that growth to continue, and it don't take long at room temp for a problem to develop. Now you use that knife, or spoon, or hand, and reintroduce bacteria and microbes onto your food.

Can be done, just have to be super safe, and super conscious of what you're doing to ensure safety. 




 Food science, here we go!

The reason that we are told to discard marinades is because of the danger of bacteria/microbial growth. Bacteria/microbes in our food=bad.

When you put chicken in the marinade, you're also (probably, likely really) putting salmonella in that marinade.

Now your marinade is a microbial bacteria soup ready to spring into death-bringing action, as long as a couple of things fall in place.

If your marinade sits out at room temp for any length of time, it's like the bacteria's parents have gone away for a long weekend and they've called everyone and let them know that it's bacteria party time, and the bacteria are all up in the parents room dividing and shit, microbes and bacteria partying together, replicating and reproducing. This is super bad. (This really starts happening just as soon as you put the chicken in the marinade, keep that in mind.)

If you marinate your birdmeat in the fridge, keeping the temp below 40 deg F you can slow down the rate of growth. It's like the bacteria are nerds, and only invite a few microbe friends over for some Minecraft action, and a couple of them get lucky and boom! Bacteria babies. They still grow, just slower.

How can you put a stop to this madness; this bacteria baccanalia, this mass production of microbes? Heat baby. If you heat anything up to at least 165 deg F for at least 4 minutes, you're gonna kill *most* bacteria/microbes in whatever you're cooking. *Most*.

So, with the question of marinades, if you have kept the marinade cold, and are using it directly after marinating, and you haven't let it sit for more than four hours, and you heat the shit outta of it, then you should be okay, but it's still a little bit risky. If you marinated at room temp, or longer than four hours, you have allowed the bacteria party to go on way to long, and when you apply heat to it, you're going to kill most, but not all. Most bacteria/microbes to begin with=more bacteriamicrobes after bringing the heat death. 

Personally, I have used the marinade after marinating it, but only rarely, and only in applications where I know that I can heat the shit out of it as part of the cooking process. (Now I make the marinade, and reserve some to the side if I want to start a sauce or something.)

As far as using the marinade as a poaching liquid...I've never tried it, if you bring it to a rolling boil for a few minutes and then reduce heat to simmering, you technically should be okay, but there is a great opportunity to screw up. (Cross contamination!)

As far as the poaching liquid alone goes, go for it! Simmering happens just below true boiling, a temperature that is on the other side of that safety barrier of 165 deg F, so as long as you don't abuse the juice (by leaving it at room temp for too long in between uses, or cross contaminating the pan or some such), totally safe to use in a sauce.  

Safety first. I say no go on the marinade, just too risky. Technically safe, but the window for fuckin' up is just too big. Poaching juice, do it. Safely.

Enjoy! Happy cooking!

 [Bob Dylan was born Robert Allen Zimmerman (Hebrew name     [Shabtai Zisl ben Avraham])[1][2] in St. Mary's Hospital on May 24, 1941, in Duluth, Minnesota,[3][4] and raised in Hibbing, Minnesota, on the Mesabi Iron Range west of Lake Superior. His paternal grandparents, Zigman and Anna Zimmerman, emigrated from Odessa in the Russian Empire (now Ukraine) to the United States following the anti-Semitic pogroms of 1905.[5] His maternal grandparents, Benjamin and Lybba Edelstein, were Lithuanian Jews who arrived in the United States in 1902.[5] In his autobiography Chronicles: Volume One, Dylan writes that his paternal grandmother's maiden name was Kirghiz and her family originated from Kazman in north eastern Turkey.[6]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan)
 




 Hmmm, funny. I never knew Bob Dylan was hispanic. 




 Personal opinion from (M40):

Text her and tell her that you'll be somewhere, and ask if she wants to be there too. Not a date, a meetup.

Use said meetup to ask for date.

 Hard to say with just this information.

Cookies are falling apart. Why?

Cookies fall apart because they are soft and gooey? Check the temp of your oven. Check your cooking times. With the addition of peanut butter to this recipe, there may be too much fat, or possibly to much water. Try refrigerating your dough before cooking. Maybe even as simple as smaller cookies might solve the problem.

Cookies fall apart because they are dry and sandy? Try removing one or both egg whites. Try changing flour. Recipe just says "flour". I use AP flour, bread flour, oatmeal flour, and winter flour, and combinations of these to get the consistency of cookie that I want.

Without more info to pinpoint problems, and without making them myself (I'm making burnt butter brown sugar prints today) I recommend reading [this post](http://bakerbettie.com/the-science-of-the-chocolate-chip-cookie/) about the science of cookie ingredients. Happy baking!

 Some jobs are hired with a salary range, not a set salary, but that's not really what it's about.

Knowing a ballpark figure of your own worth shows self confidence, but it can also show a complete lack of knowledge about the job your applying for. A CPA might be worth 65k a year, but not as a fry cook.

Knowing what the ballpark for the job you're applying for means that you've done your homework. You've researched the job. It means that your serious, you're not just doing the legwork and hoping for the best. And, additionally, to a small degree, it shows a bit about your character.

EX: If you're applying for a mid-level management position with a banking company, you do you research, you know what people in that city are making for that job, you know how the company is set financially, and you walk in knowing that the position being filled starts at 30k - 40k. When the interviewer asks you how much you expect to make, and you with no experience, just out of school, young, ask for 41k, we know you don't know what you're talking about. Inversely, if you have lots of experience in the job being offered and you low ball yourself, there are going to be questions about your self confidence.

Shoot for the middle, unless you are absolutely sure you are the most qualified applicant for the job. In that case, go high. 





























 Hmmm....Siracha. Garlic. Honey. I can a lot with those things.

Or...Cilantro. Dry Ranch Powder. Cinnamon. Some fun things there.

Or...Vodka. Whiskey. Beer. Drink the beer, hand out shots of whiskey, and use the vodka to start a fire. You won't win, but they won't forget you! 




 Complimentary harmonic vibrations. The 12th fret is the octave from the open string...when you release the note, the vibrations easily translate from the 12th fretted note to the open note. It happens with other fretted notes as well, but because they aren't directly complimentary, the vibrations either effectively cancel each other out or vibrate at levels we can't quite hear.

I already know who I am going to ask to do this for me. 














 Have you not been to Daytona before? Living downtown would be terrible, unless you truly enjoy all the nonsense going ons that happen every other weekend there. 

Daytona is the larger city, and it has its goods, but I personally don't care for it. Much of Daytona is a little rough, and the parts that arent' are expensive.

Go, check it out, talk to some locals, but as long as the bigger city issue isnt a dealbreaker for you, I recommend checking some of the outlying areas. South to New Smyrna Beach, and north to Ormond Beach. Lots of very cool seaside towns (lots of old people though) and most of the places are very ped/bike friendly. And, Daytona is right up/down the road when you need the Daytona experience.

Just my opinion, I live down New Smyrna, and I love it. Very touristy, lots of old folks, but there is so much good here it makes up for it. Prices are right too. I rent my place, across the street from the beach, 3/2.5 for 1K month. I walk/ride my bike to work/grocery store/bars/kids school. Got friends that live in other smaller towns along this strip of Volusia county (Port Orange and Ormond) and they say the same things about their towns.

Enjoy the trip, get to the beach, have fun, and good luck. 




 I used to, but I developed some habits to help me with that. Someone else mentioned a checklist, and I'm thinking I don't want to walk out doing paperwork; I'm sure I've done enough of that for the day. 

I sat down and wrote out my "closing walk". (Saved it for training incoming supervisors, too). I made sure that I covered every detail; lights, AC, TV's, alarms, locks, everything. I did it in order, and I make sure that I do it the same way, every night, every time. 

Now I don't have to think about it. I don't read my list. I just do the same thing every night, including little things like when I lock the front door, I put the keys in the opposite pocket of where they usually reside. 

Doing it the same way every time, combined with little clues like the key trick (I also say "OFF" out loud every time I check that something is off, little things like that) I never have to worry about it. Every now and again, I will doubt myself, but I can just tell myself, I've done it the same way a hundred times, I know I didn't forget anything, and I haven't in a long time. 



















 I can grow/tend crops.

I'm a pretty decent carpenter.

I'm a professional chef, and know food, and food safety. I know canning, preserving, salting and dehydrating food.

I can shoot, both gun and bow.

I can fish. I can trap.

And like a whole lot of Redditmen, I have thought about this scenario way too much, and I feel like I am fairly prepared, both in the beginning, in survival, and in rebuilding.

I am also a natural leader and love to teach, and would be great with a small group, not so much with larger groups.

Perfect scenario for me would be a small band of survivors with a stronghold. I could reinforce the stronghold, I could grow crops, I could protect the stronghold, I could lay up food for the leaner times, and in down times I could share my knowledge with others. 




 Not a bad theory, but I don't know if it fits the canon...have you read the Stand yet? Both early and late in the book it talks a little bit about Flagg, and how long he's been around. Stilson may be one instance of Flagg, but certainly not the first.

IMO, I think that Stilson fits more into the ideas talked about in Insomnia...that people serve the White, the Red, or the Random. Where Stilson fits, either Red or Random could be a lively debate. 



















 I'll start, but with the opposing view.

I'm a diehard Gator fan, have been my whole life, but I lived and worked in Tallahassee, home of the Seminoles, for almost a decade.

I loved it there. Great fans, great tailgating, plenty of ribbing for being a Gator, but I was always made to feel welcome, always had a beer for me at the parties, and I always had a good time.

Inversely, I've seen how our Gator fans treat visitors, and if the shoe was on the other foot, I don't feel that I would be as comfortable in Gainesville being a fan of whoever they were playing as I was made to feel as a Gator in Seminole Country.

If I had to complain about anything about the Seminole Nation, I would point out that their students didn't stay for whole games. Far too in a hurry to get to the parties/the bars. Saw the student section empty out game after game when I was there. But the parties were pretty f'in epic. 



















 I regret many things that I did, and have no wish to share them here. But I also recognize that each time I did something that I shouldn't have, I learned a very important lesson, and each and every one of those lessons helped me become who I am, and I am happy with that.

I regret nothing, while I am shamed by much of what I have done. 




 I though you were gonna say scratched up and broken in.
 




 I have had a little trouble with this as well. From my studies, I get

1. The difference is between the verbs estar (to be) and ser (to be). Estar is a transitive state of to be, while ser is a permanent state of to be. If you are studying, that's not something you are always doing, so "estoy estudiando" whereas if you are American, "soy americano" because that is something that you always are. The difference in the two party statements seems to be that the wording of "where is the party at?" implies that there is a party going on somewhere that won't be there forever, while "where is the party" has more permanence. It's pretty advanced grammar for so early in Memrise. (Side note: If you're using Memrise, use Duolingo.com as well, they support each other well.)

2. The simple difference is in the state of doing. "Tengo que" (I have to) is something that you feel you have to do, while "Debo de" is something you must do, because of outside forces. "Tengo que ir al bano" I have to go to the bathroom *because I have to pee*, vs Debo de ir a la catedral" I must go to the cathedral *because my mom told me too*. 

Better speakers than me please correct if wrong, but that's what I get from my reading. 




 The earliest advent of progressive forms in English came from Latin translations. In languages without a lot progressive forms, like Spanish and French, a simple verb-phrase like "I eat" could mean several different things: I eat now, I eat regularly, I eat today, etc. Latin has different verb forms for all those statements, and languages without that verb structure had to append adjectives to describe the same idea. (Spanish "I eat" is "Yo como", I eat now is "Hoy como" or "Yo como ahora", etc) So in translating the Latin, English took the route of appending verbs to a progressive form, to easily translate the Latin ideas.

[Here's a quite wordy article about some of this](http://homes.chass.utoronto.ca/~cpercy/courses/6362-lamont)

As for the increasing usage of progressive forms, I think they gain popularity becuase they are brief compared to fully explaining your meaning, and English, specifically American English, is lazy.
 





























 These would also work on Catholics, but you'd have to shoot them on Friday. 




 There are many rules.

"You can wear a pink shirt. You can have a pony tail. You can have piercings. But you shouldn't have all three." ~ Willie Nelson

The dude in the pink shirt with confidence, drinking beer is more manly than the uncomfortable blue shirted guy drinking wine, but if the pink shirt guy starts drinking wine, there are too many conflicting images. Imagine instead the burly lumberjack walking into the bar, setting down his axe, sauntering over to the bar, and ordering a glass of merlot. That works. It's better if he orders a bucket of wine, but still a glass is good.

Additionally, beer has traditionally been for the masses, while wine was enjoyed by the elite and the artistic. More bonuses.  




 A fair question.

Perhaps an argument that between classes you could make judgements of manliness...a passion fruit wine cooler is definitely less manly than a quality import beer, but overall, beer is less manly than wine.

All men drink beer. It's a given.

To be a man, you must have confidence, and presence.

Bustng out some red wine at a beer party, as long as you drink it from a paper or plastic cup, shows that you are apart from the herd, that you stand out, that you are your own man, and you follow your own rules.

But mostly, wine gets you hammered quicker and harder than beer, hence manly. Plus, technicolor vomit is a plus.

 For sure!

1. Home Depot has everything I need in one place, while Lowe's is spread about a bit more.

2. The people that shop at Lowes are far more likely to be able to id me, while Home Depot has plenty of drunks and illegal aliens, neither of which want to rock the boat!

3. Home Depot is just closer. 




 Me, I like [this guy](http://www.homedepot.com/p/Husky-D-Grip-Steel-Square-Point-Shovel-1594300/202562612#.UcjbU5yWl4M) right here. Nice square nose for quick digging and even sides, and can transfer a fair amount of material in a hurry, which can be important in this kind of project.

I never worry about disturbing the surface with this guy. I like to pick a place that's not so well traveled, and covered with ground litter....whether tree leaves, dead grass, or even trash that gets blown in to the area, this shovel allows me to get in, get dug, and get out. Kick the ground cover around, and it's like I was never there!

As far as rope or duct tape, I don't use either in any project murder hole, so I'll answer your question two ways.

One: For transfering the product to the murder hole. I like whatever is handy. I try to grab something ahead of time, but sometimes it's sort of a random unexpected thing, so i'll just use whatever is handy. Carpet, old tarp, trash bags, hell, there was this one time I had to use plastic wrap!

Two: For binding. Nothing beats rope. It really gives the feel of "oh shit, this guy is fuckin nuts! He's gonna eat my liver" to any proceedings. I keep some duct tape around, just for gagging or covering the airways completely, but I'm a rope guy! Try [this stuff here,](http://www.homedepot.com/p/t/203837266?productId=203837266 storeId=10051 langId=-1 catalogId=10053 MERCH=REC-_-SearchPLPHorizontal1-1-_-NA-_-203837266-_-N#.UcjcsJyWl4M) it really gives the scratchy ropy feel that you want, the kind that brings the real terror when they regain consciousness!

Hope that helps, and good luck. Have fun! 




 Several organizations that represent the Disabled recommend against this sort of idea.

How to treat people with disabilities is just that....treating **people** *with* disabilities.

The people-first idea of disability etiquette states that you should first always remember that it is a person with a disability, not a disabled person. (Not a blind person, but a person, with blindness).

Changing language may seem like a good idea, but can be insulting to those with disabilities. 

That sort of thing is acceptable among close friends, but in general, stay away from special language that points out disability in others.

 














 Stop using them. Those cloth reuseable bags are like a buck apiece. Buy one, each time you go shopping, and you'll have plenty in no time. Get plastic bags every now and again to use for mini trash bags, but get away from them.

Makes no sense to use bags made of petroleum products that took millions of years to create, but you're done with in less than an hour. 




 Because it makes good TV.

I don't watch the show, I'm a dedicated TV hater, but I checked out a couple of episodes back when Danny Veltri was on. He worked at a restaurant that was next door to the place that I worked, local hometown hero and such. 

I watched one episode in full. The job that day was to make some sort of fancy salad. 

I've worked in the food industry for a long time, and what I got from watching that particular episode, is that for all the money spent on that show, it is one of the worst kitchens ever set up. Here the contestants/cooks were having to run around from station to station to find all the ingredients that they needed for these salads, while Ramsay screamed at all of them for being retarded donkeys, and the only thing I could think of is why on earth would you have to go to more than one place to make a dish? What kind of set-up are these people working in? Ergonomics, flow-through, and mise-en-place were ignored in favor of making these people go four different places for four different kinds of lettuce while Ramsay got to call them all idiots.

The only thing that I took away from that episode was that the idiots were the people that thought this approximates a real kitchen in any way, or represents how things work in a professional kitchen. It may make good TV, but it certainly didn't make good chefs out of these people...Danny Veltri won, worked at Ramsay's place for what, 8 months? Got fired, tried to open some new place here in town, failed, and went and got himself locked up for DUI for driving will fucked on pills. 

It's TV, and like all TV, it doesn't represent reality.

 
























 If you're going to pump out conspiracy theories at least do your homework.

President Obama is black. Sort of.

Michelle Obama is black.

Kim Kardashian is white.

Kanye West is black. (Did you know that?) He's also a douche, but I don't think that matters.

So, here's your title.

US government contracts media outlets to push stories about Kim Kardashian's mixed baby in an effort to get Americans to accept future race mixing.

White American is becoming a minority, but I don't think that there's some cabal of old white men pushing stories about a mixed baby in order to preserve white america. 




 I'm not gonna cross off an easy win off our list yet....yet.
 














 Find gear online. Check locally, there might be local shop, but that depends on the scene around your disc golf course.

I like [primediscs.com](https://www.primediscs.com/), and [marshallstreet](http://www.marshallstreetdiscgolf.com/), and [discgolfstore.com](http://www.discgolfstore.com/), but that's just like, my opinion, man. 




 Discs can be a pretty personal thing. If she's gotten into the game at all she may be quite picky about what plastic she will throw.

As far as discs go, if you're going that route without knowing what she's into, sneak a peek in the bag and she what kind of discs she has already, and get the upgraded level. (EX: Innova bottom line plastic is DX, she has a DX Beast, get her a Champion or Star Beast; same disc, better plastic)

Out side of that, accessories will be the easiest. A new bag is always a welcome addition. (I keep growing out of my bag, got a bit of disc collecting problem) I think someone mentioned a practice basket; that would be an epic present for someone starting out. 

Nowhere near as cool, but giftcards to a discseller might be an option as well.

And go out there and play, it's fun! 




 [Someone sold one on Ebay](http://www.ebay.com/itm/RARE-INNOVA-PRESENTS-PRE-RELEASE-PROTOTYPE-CHAMPION-APE-/140976210819) and listed it as an Ape. 









 Yes, yes I will. 




 Perfectly, every time. Chicken release is now what I'm calling that, too. I hope my wife appreciates that.

RELEASE THE CHICKEN!!! 









 Haven't made them yet, just ran across them this morning...but I do my baking on the weekend, so giving it some thought...but I just can't do all the premade crap, gotta go scratch!
 




 I thought about doing a bar cookie and then topping with creme brulee, but once cut into bars, it would go all mushy. Gonna have to go with mini muffin cups, and press sugar cookie dough into little bowl shapes...thought I may try a shortbread crust as well. 




 She is alive and well in my SO's imagination. 




 What a great idea! I can't see how this could possibly be abused by anyone! Sign me up! 




 I think my brain broke. But not the most difficult thing I ever masturbated to.  




 Dude is straight-up eye-fucking the camera while working that chicken leg...that's bad enough, but it's the shirt that tells you "I'm saving you in the spank-bank for a later withdrawl." 




 Your daughter needs love and attention and cuddling and nurturing.

But you know what else she needs?

Diapers, food, a roof over her head, shots, doctors visits, immunizations, clothes, toys to help her learn, more diapers, more food, and about a billion other things that cost money.

What you're doing is hard. It's hard work, it's hard on you, and it's hard on your family. But if this is what you two have decided is the balance of labor, then you have to stop feeling guilty. You are helping when you can, and the time that you are not at home is not time *not* helping, it's just helping in a different way.

IMO, I don't think mama is being very fair here. If she's giving you hell because you are not there through the hard times she's having, it's because she's not recognizing how hard it is for you to get up and leave your family every morning to go make the money that gives the both of you the ability to create this family.

There is the possibility of some form of post partum depression here, but overall I think mom is feeling overwhelmed (just from what you described) and I think she's taking it out on you. 

You need to talk. This could get a lot worse, and if things are the way you describe them, you can't change things. You have to work. She has to care for the baby. Time to sit down and work this out, and if you can't, it's counseling time.

This is a serious issue, and if you have a good support network (parents/church/friends/etc) maybe get them involved, but stop feeling guilty for doing what you have to do. It's not healthy for you, and not healthy for baby. 



















 Still haven't pulled the trigger on the 3....I've already got 3 Sharks in the bag, I'd have to give something else up to pop it in there. River? Amp? Hmmm, maybe my Zombeee? 




 Now I don't feel so lonely. 

I love the Shark. I putted with the Shark exclusively for the first five years I played. I still use the Shark on iffy puts from outside my comfort zone, but am slowly transitioning to Anodes. 

My game has gotten better since weaning myself off of my Shark addiction (still my go to fairway and upshot choice) but while I can sink the long ones now with the Anodes, I still pull off a minor miracle every now and again and ring the chains from distance with the Shark. 

Good on you, fellow Sharker, go with what works, and ignore the hivemind...but don't let habit get in your way of making improvements, either.  









 I don't know how it would work in hilly terrain; I don't play on hills, but I put an air bounce shot towards a short basket. Throw nose up with a straight putter that won't fade, and as it gives up its energy, it will float down almost vertical, with just a light fade. Got a hole on my home course that I use that shot on often, and I can't chain it that way, I guarantee the bird. 




 I had a very similar power problem on approach shots for quite a long time....75' to 100' feet out, should be able to plop it right next to the basket, and I would sit 20' or 30' out from it.

A local on my home course said he dealt with the same problem, and approaches it two ways.

One, if the shot is clear, he overpowers and takes a big hyzer line, arcing into place into of a straight shot. (It took a while to practice it, but I can do that with some finesse now)

Two, if a straight approach is necessary, target a tree/bush/garbage can/random junkie that's about 20-30'+ *past* the basket (that's the distance I was having trouble with) and try to shoot *through* the basket to the target beyond it. Improved my approach game quickly, and now it's automatic for me on upshots; can plop 'em down with little trouble. I applied that same thinking to a lot of my longer putts and have been sinking 'em from farther out, too. 









 The dollar store may be your friend, but the internet may save your life. Save up some money, get a pre-loaded Visa gift card (or equivalent) and visit an on-line sex shop and purchase something safe! Not everything laying about your house is safe to go jammin up yer bum. 

You mentioned your sister, and I have no idea why, because I don't think that she would fit up there. 




 If you're worried about them, you're not going to be able to stop thinking about them, so use that energy and apply it to something else. 

Work on some sort of crafty thing that you think will make them happy. A homemade card, a photo collage, a custom made get well gift. Write a short story about them as a superhero. 

Doesn't really matter what, whatever art it is that you do/have, use that energy in a positive way to influence that art/craft, plus you have a great gift to share when that loved one/family member returns home!

 Cool. But be advised that the direct translation there is someone who has sex with food. 




 It has worked for me, a bunch.

It's not the food as much as commanding a kitchen. Showing competence and confidence while performing a task.

It's a show, and I put on a good one. 

And I call myself a gastrosexual. (CTGL, go ahead and use that one)

 My youngest is fivealmostsix (that's how she says it) and what amazes me is how quickly you forget about how small they are. He's definitely got baby fever with one so young, but a gift that will keep those memories would be something I personally would enjoy.

Got plenty of pictures, but things like audio recordings, or hand/feet prints, even clothes to help him remember what she was like was she was tiny.

And some kind of sexytime for Dad. Don't forget that. 





























 [Memrise.com](http://www.memrise.com). Cool site. User submitted classes. Multiple languages available. Seems to be heavier on vocabulary type classes, light on grammar type classes.

Return the favor by doing the same for folks all over the world that are trying to learn English. 
























 That's how I'd approach it, but unless the piece had movement that required that form, I'd find a workaround. I've got good hands, but that's a bear. 




 I don't use my mic at all. Every now and again, I'll reheat veggies or steam veggies in the mic, but other than that (and a very occasional bag of popcorn) I don't use it at all.

Funny story, though. I had a small economy mic in my kitchen that probably bounced through two or three different places that we lived. We had some friends over for the weekend, and a friend of a friend broke the little latchy thingy that closes the door, rendering the microwave inoperable. By the time I got downstairs, she was already gone to the nearest big box store to replace it. I would have told her not to worry, but friends said that she was ultra upset about it, and needed to replace it.

Long story short, I now have this deluxe, high-end microwave, all programmable and shit, with the porcelain inductor element for browning, several bells and a couple of whistles, that I use to occasionally heat up leftover veggies.  




 From bottom to top, pinky-first-second-third. But that's a real tough way to play a Dm, why not play it in first position? Or, just play the barre chord? Are you learning that BOC song that's played with all the chords on the inside four?

 [PickPunch](http://www.pickpunch.com/plastic-sheets.html) sells them on their website, might not be the best price, but readily available in small quantities. 




 As always, the answer here is to talk to your SO about this, in a  non-confrontational, non-accusing way.

Saying that, I wouldn't look too much into it. My wife and I have an active and exciting sex life. She is my porn star. When I get bored and surf the web for porn, I don't look for the "normal" porn, I like to check out the extreme stuff. And not always for self-release, sometimes I just like to see Japanese women peeing on seafood, or Brazilian women farting into cakes. Yes, I search this out because these are things that I don't see at home, but that doesn't mean that I want my wife to pee on an octopus, or fart with her ass full of peanut butter, or get railed by three well-endowed black fellas for that matter. 

 






















































 I don't see a blowout either, but I can see a win. UoM could take it, but they won't take it by ten, and I'm not sure that the score will go that high for either team.

 




 My B home course, [Tuscawilla Park](http://www.dgcoursereview.com/course.php?id=98#) (Touchawilly) has recently put in a zipline course.

Love this course, extra strokes for hitting a zipliner. (I've come close a few times!) 




 We scored 24 at home against Toledo while only using a third of our playbook. Muschamp is playing against the tape. He's wily.  









 No, not really. Most of these types of laws are called "Blue Laws"; they're just holdovers from a more prudish time. Our American system of law doesn't make it as easy to repeal laws as it is to pass them, so these laws are still on the books, but not really ever enforced.

Saying that, there have been times recently where these laws were used to arrest people, most recently in Texas, where a male couple were arrested for violating state sodomy laws, but the judge threw the case out of court. 




 The first couple years are adjustment years, and that's tough because the first couple years are also the busiest and hardest couple of years. Talk with your SO, make plans to set aside a small amount of time (baby comes first, dad) for yourself. When the kid gets a little older it becomes a little easier.

I also am a musician, and had to give up the stage for fatherhood. While I miss it terribly, I now have a home recording studio, two great and curious kids that see me in the studio, making music daily, and am making plans to attempt a comeback to the stage. 

Good luck, dad. Make time for baby. Make time for SO, make time for you. That order for the next couple of years. 




 I think a phone call or two is reasonable. If he's already been contacted and has your number, I feel like the next step is his. If he wants it, he'll call you. 

If I was in your spot I'd probably hang on to it for a little while longer, but if I didn't hear from him again for a few weeks, keep the disc, toss the disc, sell the disc. 














 Yeah, that's pro level shite right there, but seriously, get a new cutting board. If you use those types of plastic cutting boards, you either have to scrape them down fairly regularly or replace them. All those scratches and cuts harbor germs, no matter how well you wash them. You can bleach soak it, but then you run the danger of not rinsing well enough.

Thanks, had to get that out of my system. 




 Ok, for real. My two favorites are [Ultimateguitar.com](http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/) because it allows me to one-click transpose keys, and I also like [e-chords.com](http://www.e-chords.com/) for just about the same reason, though it's key based instead of step based. UG.com gives a good auto-scroll, but e-chords has multiple chord shapes, so good and bad in both.

Saying that, I almost always just google what I'm looking for, because not every site is going to have what I want, and I've just got enough experience to know which sites I prefer, and will look for them in results first. But I use what I have to to learn what song I'm looking for, even OLGA...lol, even youtube for that matter, a good source of video lessons.

Happy hunting.

 Good on her for reading well.

That said, one of the biggest problems that I have with our education system is that we treat each kid as exactly the same. Each kid at this certain point should be able to do A, B, and C, and if they don't, they're falling behind.

I don't feel that our kids are interchangeable pieces in a puzzle, and both my kids read above their level, but my older child's comprehension is terrible. So does that mean that I should be happy that he knows big words, or concerned that he doesn't remember what they mean? We can't keep shoehorning our kids into pigeonholes that we want them to fit in...

Saying all that, if she's reading that well, you're probably doing a good job at home helping...keep it up. Raising an intelligent child takes more than our manufacturing model of a school system that teaches little else than blind respect for authority and the ability to memorize useless trivia and recall it on demand.

 I was just talking about this here...also, Muschamp may be trying to load the tape, get Miami looking at a bunch of stuff they don't need to know. He sneaky. I like.  




 We're getting to a point where a lot of teams are a whole lot better than one would expect. I think that because of the increased TV coverage every year, it makes more sense to be a starter on a "bad" team than it would to be a second- or third-string on a "good" time. I enjoyed the Toledo/UF game.

Go Knights, BTW. 




 I was surprised...happy...elated....drunk...that was a good Saturday. 




 Oh come on now....I like the Bulls, I like the Golden Knights, hell I'll even watch a Miami game every now and again....and my local II school, Stetson Hatters, won a big opener....first game in almost a hundred years! 




 Heh. Yep.
 




 It was difficult my friend, it was difficult. 

 




 I was the GM of a large restaurant right off campus. Owners were huge boosters, both alums. Did catering for the QB Club, game day sales were huge. Lots and lots of fun.  




 It is Labor day....
 




 That's why I'm here. After our weak (IMO) performance against Toledo Saturday night....well hoping to see some holes. I think our D can slow Winston down, but can our O score against the Noles D? Hope to find that answer tonight. 




 Hey hey hey. Stopping by to check out the competition.

As a Gator fan, I suppose it's expected that I give out a mighty 'GO PANTHERS!!' but I just don't have it in me.

I lived and worked in Tallahassee for a decade, and my job required my attendance at several games. I enjoyed, and still enjoy, Seminole football...just not in the last week of November, and any time that the Seminoles losing means we win something.

So for the first time this season, and perhaps only time, (depends...I think I'll be rooting for the Nation to take Clemson down!) let me give a hearty..

GO NOLES!!

- Tomahawks wildly in his living room, knocking over beers!!

WOO!! 


































 Short answer is that when the punting team is the first to touch the punted ball, the ball is dead. If the receiving team is the first to touch the ball, the ball becomes live, and can be moved upfield, recovered by the other team, or, when it rolls into the endzone, touched back. 







































 Correct. They wouldn't need one of those dedicated sound cards with the connections (and bells and whistles), but if they are buying an off the shelf PC, they might want to consider a soundcard upgrade for sound quality. (Especially important for sound reproduction which makes the mixing side of home recording a whole lot easier.) 




 This happens too often. 

Collect to go menus. Rip the restaurant names off, fold up and put in a jar. No restaurant picked in two rounds, pick out of the jar. 




 Welll.....I can say that now, because frankly, I've put my dong in crazy enough times to know it's never worth it, and got lucky enough to come out the other end with a good woman. 




 First, all of your questions can be answered at [Tweakheadz Labs](http://tweakheadz.com/). Learn. Learn more. Read. Read more. Reference. Great site.

1. Two schools of thought. Dedicated computer for recording is gonna cost half a buttload, with high end sound card with dedicated recording connectors. Or, any decent off the shelf with a soundcard upgrade. (I use a PC straight out of the box, with a soundcard that cost about $200)

2. You need a DAW (recording software) and yes it must be compatible. There are many out there. Some free. Some thousands.

3. Connections depend on the interface. For an amp recording, in general would be amp - condenser mic - A/D interface. There are many other options though, check Tweak.

4. Cable control! It will get worse before it gets better, learn to tame the cables. Use cable ties, and label them.

5. Read the guide man. It probably came with paperwork. If not, google the product name and number, you can  usually find it online.

6. I've been a musician for 25+, and a home recorder for a decade. I spend more time researching than playing/recording. (To be fair, most of my troubles are in the mixdown area, learning how to engineer a decent sound out of what I just recorded.)

7. You should also check out r/wearethemusicmakers here on reddit. Pros that don't (usually) mind answering noob questions. 




 Zero. ZEEEEE-ROY Jenkins!! Zip. Nada. Nil. None. 




 I'm not happy with the name, will take suggestions. 




 Might add that to the list. 




 Combine this with the recent reports of what's happening in the Pacific after the Fukushima event in Japan, and it paints a pretty terrible picture. 




 Yeah, mine too, but now I get points for it! 




 Funnies: Before match play, the group comes up with a selection of scenarios. Things that can happen on the course, but are rare enough to be unique. 

Examples:

* Hit a tree on the drive, still par
* Out of bounds, in bound shot for par
* Chain out birdie, still par

It is only limited by what you want to imagine, and the group assigns points to the individual "funnies" . (You can even have bonus multipliers like hit a tree on the drive, still par for three points, tree drive and birdie, double it for six.)

Get creative. We score it by total points + strokes under par (or minus over) for total win. Put some money on it and make an interesting disc golf outing. 



















 In between Orlando and Tampa is a whole lot of woods, and a whole lot of rednecks. While stopping in any of these small towns can provide a *certain* type of entertainment, I wouldn't bring my sister with me.

Saying that, Tampa (and the metro area) is one of the larger cities in the Southeast, and offer lots of things worth doing. 

I used to live in the area, about a half hour south of Clearwater, but I live on the East Florida coast now, so some info may be dated, but I get over there often enough.

First and foremost, in St Petersburg, south of your destination after leaving the Tampa area, is the [Dali Museum](http://thedali.org/home.php). Worth the trip. (If you're going out of your way, check out [Fort Desoto](http://fortdesoto.com/) an early Spanish emplacement.

In Tampa, there are museums and galleries and historic places galore, but what stands out in my mind is [Ybor City](http://www.yborcityonline.com/), the old Cuban area of downtown. I know you already did your shopping touristy thing, but the afternoons and early evenings are for checking out the artsy little shops while you figure out which awesome restaurant you want to eat at. Stay into the evening for great music everywhere. 

Clearwater itself is kinda boring. It's got great beaches, so definitely get your feet wet, and you should also know that Clearwater is home to a large [group of Scientologists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearwater,_Florida#Scientology) who were trying to take over the world.

If you play discgolf by any chance, Clearwater is a hotbed of disc golfing activity.

Enjoy your trip. And one final note. As you come into Tampa on I-4, to merge into I-275, your most likely route, do be careful. It gets just a little insane through that area, and play your driving to NOT be in that area during rush hours.  





























 It's not exactly what you're talking about, but you should check out the doc section of [instantwatcher.com](http://instantwatcher.com/genres/130). I love this site for my Netflixing. So much better of a UI. 




 Think on this.

If you know the notes of the guitar, the scales up and down the strings, and you know the forms for F and Bm, then you know barres.

The notes on the E string, E(open) F (1) G(3) A (5) and so on right?

The full barre form of the F chord, from the bass E, is 133211, right?

So, looking at the root of the F barre, the first fret on the bass E is F, right?

So if the next step up at the third fret on the bass E is the G note, then it stands to reason that the same form that is an F when the root is on the first fret would be a G when the root is on the third fret. (3355433)

So as long as you know the notes up the E string, you know the barre forms for all of those chords. This also works for most barre variants. The Fm shape (133111) played where the root note is on the 5th fret on the bass E would be an Am. (355333)

Same theory applies to the Bm barre form that's played on the second fret on the A string.(x24432) One half step up from that root B is the C note, so that same form slid up one half step becomes a Cm. (x35543)

Does that help? 




 Get rechargeables. You will save a ridiculous amount of money this way. Also be choosy about toys. There are so many toys out there that make noise just because they can. They don't necessarily add any education/play for baby or older, they just are loud. We personally choose to stay away from most battery operated toys, preferring to let our children's imagination decide what that fire truck should sound like. 







































 Obviously high guitar player. 

Used this handle in one form or another for a really long time....first AOL account..., shit, has it really been almost 20 years? Fuck me.

 Umm.

Reddit is an amazing source of news, current events, and social concerns. There are great minds having great discussions on subs all over this site. It truly is the front page of the internet, and an amazing tool.

Reddit is an amazing source of boobs, current beaver shots, and gay porn. There are hot chicks posting pics of their hot bods on subs all over this site. It truly is the first place I go to wank it, my amazing tool.

You did both, I think. If you proctor his time on reddit and introduce him to the right things, and don't let him on without supervision, and guide his front page customization, you might be alright. But the porn will happen anyway, and Reddit isn't the worst place to experience it. 




 Yep. You can get a lot of respectable distance out of a forehand, but kinetic chaining is how you get the real long distance; that comes from the run-up and the cross step...things that are eliminated with the forehand to a certain degree. 




 I hope so. Nice to meet another dye-er out there. We have a good group on Thursday mornings, about seven of us regulars...you could prbably beat six of us... 




 The brown spots on your skin look like a fungal infection....similar to athlete's foot. Before an expensive trip to the dermy, try showering with an anti-dandruff shampoo. Use it as a bodywash for about two weeks. If they don't clear up, you're only out the price of a bottle of head and shoulders...lol. (Experience? My dermatologist wrote me a scrip for something that looked very familiar, and then the nurse told me to try the anti-dandruff shampoo first. Never filled the scrip.) 














 That was the one that I was familiar with. 




 That's part of why I switched as well. At 41, I could feel it staining my elbow. 


































 Favorite so far. 




 It is crap. Utter crap. But, and this is important...*they're reading*.

Think about that for a second.

Even if only one of ten, hell even one of one hundred, continue to read, they will move past this crap, and hopefully become well rounded adult readers.

Isn't there anything you read as a kid/teen that you might be embarrassed to admit to?

Saying that...jesus christ, two shelves of that shit? Garbage.

Also, not WTF. 




 I also considered a "clusterfuck of customers". 

In the vein of better names for customers, runner up here in the restaurant was a "munch of cattle", tied with a "cuss of old ladies". 




 My vote would certainly be a "bitch of customers". 




 This works for me.

I cup my chin in my hand, with fingers facing forward, and use my chin/jaw to move my hand more than focusing on my hand. That way I can focus on technique, and have the added digital stimulation. 




 [instantwatcher.com](http://instantwatcher.com/). So much better for search, and when you find something you like, you can click through direct to Netfllix (if you watch on PC). Sort by new, expiring, or genre. Search by star. Good stuff. 




 I started this game as a forehand player. I had a respectable drive forehand, hitting just short of the 300' wall, but I knew that I needed to add backhand to my game. I focused on it, and months all I could throw was about 250'.

First major thing to look at is disc selection. I dumbed my discs down. Threw midranges as my drivers until I could crank them a bit. Reason behind that is that shorter/lower speed discs are "easier" to throw; simply meaning that if you are out there trying to throw a speed 13 400' without good form, you are going to have trouble getting good throws.

Second, just focus on form. Keep throwing it right. It took me a few months, but once I could throw lower speeds closer to where I knew they should go, I went back to my drivers, and was able to send 'em out far.

One year of dedicated practice later, I can send my speed 10 beasts an easy 300-325, and getting better every time I play.

Stick with it, keep practicing, and throw the right plastic.

Good luck. 









 Hmmm, well, I've got this big bucket over here to hold all the downvotes, so....

Dubstep and its ilk are not music, it's sound. 

Well organized, well mixed, interesting sound, but not music.

 Music requires instruments, and skill on them, and if you making dub makes you a musician, then me having a microwave makes me a chef. 
























 True enough. I just said *less* slant, not non-existent. Even though I've enjoyed much of Moore's docs, I don't know if any of his would be on my personal 100 best...just too slanty. 




 I've seen most of these, and I think it's a fair list.

But...

Moore's Sicko in the top 25? And not Bowling for Columbine? Sicko was decent, but BFC was done with far less slant than Sicko, and far more powerfully done.

An Inconvienent Truth barely breaking the top 100? It wasn't the best cinematic piece, but I think the importance of that doc will only increase over time.

That being said, I'm so happy to have seen most of the doc's on this list, that I'm gonna pull my Prius over and sniff my own farts for a minute or two. 




 I assume that the Gators candle is going to smell like the jeans shorts crotch of a sweaty co-ed, with a bit of cheap domestic beer thrown in, with undertones of chewin' tobaccy, and a slight hint of regret. 



















 Yeah, I play in FL, so it wasn't the best decision, but I put a big black military star on it, and it's surprisingly easy to find, midrange too, so I'm not hucking it out 300' and trying to guess where it ended up. 




 The new formulas of RIT dyes are on the shelves, and they don't work for dyeing.

Well, sort of.

I've had some luck stipling (spotting) discs with RIT dye black and getting really interesting changes on color. I stipled a white goldline River with black RIT and got blue speckles. I also made a paste of RIT black and used it on a bright green Innova champ Shark to get a military/olive green. Both of these were using the powder packs, with no water, just enough acetone to make mud. I haven't tried the liquid RIT.

I've used the Idye Poly line, without the color conditioner, and I get bright vibrant color quickly, with little to no problems.

My. Two. Cents. 



















 Yes, obvious to most of us, but I was surprised by how many folks I spoke to today had never heard of Snopes. 




 In talking to my coworkers about a few things that are patently false on the internet (surprise!) I realized that many people apparently do not know about this place. [Snopes.com](http://www.snopes.com/) is a great resource to find out the truthiness of just about anything that you find on the internet.

 You're certainly trying to stuff a lot of Florida into one week!

I'm a Florida native, and I've lived and partied and visited pretty much the whole state.

All the alligator stuff is Everglades/South Florida stuff, including the airboat tour. Very cool, very fun. If you can afford it, get a private trip instead of one of the public tours. The public tours are bigger boats, seats for anywhere between 12 and 20. The private ones are you and a guide, out in the swamp, on a smaller (and faster!) boat. Eating alligator is a Florida tourist thing. You can get that at just about any decent seafood restaurant. It's best blackened with cajun spices, if not that, then fried. Step it up a bit, and look for Gator Jerky when you're in South Florida. That's some good stuff.

Kennedy Space Center! I love KSC. Very awesome, super sciency, can experience the whole place in half a day, but if you want to do any of the longer tours, or have lunch with an astronaut (Really!!) plan on a whole day. Surfing you definitely want to do on the East Coast. Cocoa (near KSC) has some great surf spots, head north to New Smyrna Beach (the birthplace of Florida Surfing, and home of one of the longest surf clubs, the Surfari Club. *Full Disclosure: I live in NSB, I'm partial to the scene here.

Crystal River/Blue springs is awesome. Your Canadian? So maybe your used to cold, but swimming the springs in Feb is not something that this Floridian would do. Check on that swimming with a manatee thing, pretty sure that's illegal everywhere in FL.

Sarasota is alright, the museum is really the standout, the Ringling Museum of Art is the home of quite a few masterworks. Great trip down there from the Tampa/St. Pete area as well. The Sunshine Skyway bridge that takes you over the mouth of the bay is Florida's tallest bridge. If you have time, stop at the little gift shop place on the north end of the bridge, and learn about the Skyway Disaster....a boat struck the bridge causing a collapse and the death of 35 people.

St Pete is great. I grew up in the area. Make time to get to the Bayfront...it's the touristy sort of area of St Pete. Very pretty. Make time for the pier. You like the Ringling in Sarasota, you'll love the Dali Museum in St. Pete. 

The beaches are great on the gulf, but I'm an East Coast guy now, so I'm partial to the beaches in Florida that don't smell like dead fish. Personal opinion, and hot topic for debate here...which side of the state is better.

North to Tampa to find Ybor city for the Cuban, the cigars, the brewery. Have fun at the strip club.  









 In the pictures that you show, it's speciation. Certain types of shrimp will cook to a different shade of pink, or even orange. Also, within species of shrimp, diet can change coloration by quite a bit.  




 In other news, my Christmas list now includes body armor.
 









 Do you have the video of the absolutely epic beatdown that guy must have received after doing that to that dude? I would whip him like heavy cream. 




 We do have a medical movement, and it looks like it might make the ballot, but the voting blocks in the center of the state and the north of the state are ultra conservative, and the new folks moving in are generally moving into areas that are already democratic/liberal. Over time, change will come, but I just don't know how fast.
 




 Somewhere in the ultra-conservative, rightwing-religious middle states, most likely. I'm thinking Kansas. Unfortunately, here in Florida we won't be that far ahead of them, methinks. 




 I agree. Glad to see Turtledove on there twice, but none of my favorites are on there. Hard to chose when all he writes is althistory I guess... 







































 SUBconsciously....I'm doing that thing right now. Add a head shake to it, does that change the name? 




 Here in FL we have something called "Cottage Industry". Google that shit, if your state has something similar, you are allowed to sell a certain amount of certain items without hitting the threshold for the thousands of laws to kick in.

We haven't done anything, but we've looked into it for homemade sauces and rubs and mustards, and while I don't remember what the unit limit was, it was easily within the farmer's market saleability level, if that makes sense. 




 Funny. I use this gesture often. Both unconsciously when I'm thinking, and as body language to show frustration. It never occurred to me that it might have a name. Saving to see if anyone comes up with it. 




 She's upset that you're happy? You guys split, mutually, to be frank, it's none of her damn business if you decide to get over and be happy. If you're trying to rekindle, then I would be careful how you present yourself, but if you're happily unmarried, then be happily unmarried. Her opinion shouldn't matter anymore. 




 Those are all very attractive representations of something that I don't find attractive at all. Plus one for calling it "resting bitchy face" though. 




 Two ways.

Before sexytimes. Bring up sexytimes in casual conversations. Ask him if there is anything he wants that you're not doing, or special things he wants. If he doesn't ask you the same question back (shame on him if he doesn't) use that opportunity to mention it.

During sexytimes. Grab his fuckin' head, kiss him, tell him to lick your fuckin' balloonknot. NOW! (This would work for me if wifeypoo told me that, I would respond accordingly.)

Edit: Do not say balloonknot under any circumstances. 









 [Where's George.com](http://www.wheresgeorge.com/wild.php) is very cool. Check it out, enter the number. 




 I think AS is worth reading. It reads long...not exactly action packed, but especially today, with so many conservatives quoting Ms. Rand, it's important to know what they're quoting. Read it for that, if nothing else. 

Disclosure: Yes, I am a liberal, but I'll admit that I had to rethink some of my ideals after reading this book. I also reaffirmed many of my ideals. 




 At first I wanted some potato salad....and then things got weird. 




 Yeah, me too. I'm on every day, for about forty minutes, and most of that time is reinforcing previous learning, not learning new skills. 









 Yeah, that is not a hole out. Got to be **in** the basket
 




 Don't miss that next shot. 




 Yes. Stretch the skin and do so carefully.
 




 That's usually how it works. I guess it would have been better to say...if you think there is a chance, put the drink down and have some water, if you're there to get wrecked, don't chase tail. 




 Yeah, it happens. It has happened, or will, to just about every dude you know, so don't sweat it.

Tips: Don't drink so fuckin' much if you think you're gonna get laid. 









 It is sort of just Franks' plus garlic. Still delicious. I have so many hotsauces in my cabinet, sometimes I'm just choosing which shade of red I want to use. 




 Sharks are my goto utility/long-approach/fairway/ohshithowdoIgetoutofthisbush disc. I love 'em. Picked up a Shark3. Like it, don't love it. It's long...it's I think only one number higher in either glide or speed, can't remember off hand, but that thing sails. I use it as a steady straight short fairway utility, but just don't have much need for that in my game. I usually reach for the 3 when I hit an early tree, but have an umimpeded straight shot to the tee that's too short for mid-range but too long for approach. I often overshoot with this disc though. It sails easily, at least for me. I also use this disc for rainy days, as I can crank it off the tee, and the grip on that fat rim negates any slippy from the rain. 




 My wife and I were together for ten years, had two kids together, a whole life together and hadn't pulled the trigger on getting married.

We wanted to, we just hadn't gotten around to it.

I wanted to still surprise her, but I knew it would  be difficult, what with a shared bank account, a shared life, a shared house.

First, the ring. I enlisted the MIL. I had her bring prospective rings to my job, and I would look at them, and then she would bring me some more to look at a few days later. Once the ring was selected, I had a good friend hold on to it to keep it hidden, and as the ring I eventually choose was a heirloom ring, payment wasn't an issue.

I talked to the family without my SO's knowledge and planned a dinner so that her sister and mom and family at large could be there.

I had the sister involved in securing the restaurant and decorating...and also on some after engagement dinner party favors. That last part my SO was aware of, and she kept asking if she should go meet her sister, and I kept having to come up with excuses why that was a bad idea. (Mostly because she wasn't at her house, she was down the street at a restaurant near our house!). This led to my wife being a bit grumpy as to why I didn't want her leaving the house that day.

I asked her if she wanted to go get dinner, and kept it vague, telling her to dress up, and got her and the kids loaded up in the car and headed out.

When we pulled up in front of the restaurant, she started complaining...it was a nicer place that we hadn't been to  yet, and she didn't want "to go with the kids...we should go there alone so we can enjoy ourselves". 

I've got 12 people waiting inside, and a ring burning a hole in my pocket at that point.

I think I said that the kids and I were going to go have dinner, and if she wanted to come in she was welcome to.

When we got inside, she saw the family gathered, and thought that that was the surprise; that the family had gotten together for dinner.

I had a speech planned, blah blah blah, all this time together, blah blah blah....

All I said was "I knew that I loved you, and even after today, I know I want to do this." Got down on the knee, she said yes, restaurant clapped, wine from the manager, family had a great meal.

We were married on the beach four years ago. Our best friend officiated. All of our friends and family were there, and she hasn't been mean to me since. 














 Threatens by fax? Does North Korea even take North Korea serious? Who threatens by fax? South Korea should publish the source number of the fax, and then all of us could go to our grandparents house to use their fax machines, and send black pages to North Korea. We could break them in hours; problem solved. 

I'll accept my Peace Prize in person, thank you. 





























 Dibs on that as a band name! I call dibs!! 




 Thank you for that injection of ultrafunk into my otherwise boring day. You guys rip. 

Unrelated, but I checked out a couple videos of  yours on the Tube, (I really liked that Byrd cover, BTW) and eventually I got to a point where all the recommended videos on the right side were 9/11 conspiracy films... 




 Yeah, I'm a fan of that one.

I don't know what to tell you; I feel that it's worth reading through. More things happen towards the last half, good things, great stories, but the overall feel of the novel won't change. At its heart, it's just a story about a dude and the things that happen in his life.

Read it. Give it another couple chapters. I think you'll get more into it. 




 Insomnia. So many ties to the DT series. Start reading it now, and tell Ralph I said hi. 









 My fourth birthday party.

I don't have any other memories even around that early, at least anymore, but I remember a lot of things from the summer I turned four. 

I was born in July of  '72, and '76 was the Bicentennial for the USA. It was a big deal, turning 200, and everything, I mean everything, was red white and blue. I remember seeing flags everywhere, and the Fourth was pretty epic.

My birthday cake (about two weeks after the fourth) was red white and blue, and my presents were wrapped in red white and  blue and even the toys I got were red white and blue. 




 I'm terribly guilty of this, but I rarely waste food.

I like to shop without recipes/meals in mind...that helps me make value based decisions. Instead of going to the market and hoping to find a good price on a particular cut of meat, I can go to the market and find the best deals and worry about production later.

I also like the challenge of coming up with new meals every day (that I get to prepare meals at home). It's a nice game to play. Got to pull something out to thaw sometime after lunch, and that gives me about four hours to figure out what I'm going to do with it.

Saying that, I also don't buy "rare" items and/or speciality or expensive items without having some idea what I'll be doing with it later, and if something goes too long in the freezer without being used, well into the crockpot you go, and poof! STEW! 














 God save me from a steakum, and steakum style cheesesteak are possible proof that Satan exists. 

Absolutely valid, as most steak for a good, real cheesesteak are going to be hand cut, and you just can't achieve that thin of a slice with a knife and years of skill. 




 The Philly Cheesesteak is at its heart a steak sandwich. A *sliced* steak sandwich.

You could make a steak sandwich out of any cut.

You could, if you wanted, just put a hunk of chuck on a bun and call it a steak sandwich, but it would be impossible to chew. So sliced.

Meat has a grain, like wood. If you have to slice up some steak to grill, you want to consider the grain. You can cut cross-grain or with the grain.

With the grain, you end up with long slices of steak with the grain running down the length, meaning that when you bite into it, you would be trying to chew across the long grain (strands, if you will) of the slice. Think potroast, how it falls apart into those long strands, it would be like that, but nowhere near as tender. (We're not going to talk about grilled meats vs roasted meats here. There's something special about grilled meat, and when I want a cheesesteak, I want that grilled flavor, if I wanted something all tender and pot-roasty, I'll have a Carolina style BBQ sandwich.)

Across the grain, you end up with a long slice of meat with the grain running in short strands from the top to bottom of the slice, instead of along the long axis. (Think stacked, like a bunch of matchsticks in a row.) This is better. Your bite is separating strands of meat instead of trying to cut through them. Easier.

So, knowing this, why Ribeye? Fat.

Fat is flavor, for one thing. But maybe more importantly (like something could be more important than fat/flavor, right?) the places on each individual slice where there is fat, there will be a break in the muscle strands, or grain, providing yet even more ease when it comes to chewing. It provides probably the best grilled steak slices, as long as you aren't trying to avoid fat of course.

There may be a fair amount of tradition involved as well, but that's for someone else to talk about. 




 GO TIGERS!!
 









 i-Dye poly is available at most craft stores, and you can find it online. Just make sure you get the iDye that's made for polyesters not cottons. 

Mix iDye and water. Use slightly less than the amount of water suggested on the package for the stovetop method. No alcohol needed. iDye comes with a color conditioner in the package. DO NOT USE.  Mix up your iDye, toss it on the stove, heat it up to just below a simmer, turn off heat, let cool to the touch, dye away using the dip method or paint method. Dye stores in plastic for just about forever, you just have to heat it up to just below a simmer before using it again.

My only complaints about iDyes are that the colors are a little unpredictable. One dye and you have to let a disc sit for ten minutes to get a vibrant red, and the next dye it happens in two. Other than that I love this product. Better than old RIT. There's been virtually no fading on my Gold Line River, though I have seen some fading with use on some Innova Champion dyes that I have done.

[You can buy iDye just about anywhere online](https://www.google.com/#q=iDye+poly safe=off tbm=shop) or in a brick and mortar like Joanna's or Micheal's. (Hobby Lobby carries it as well I believe, but fuck Hobby Lobby.)

[Here's a link to an (old) forum post about the switch to iDye from RIT.](http://www.dgcoursereview.com/forums/showthread.php?t=43518) It's a little out of date, but informative.

Happy dyeing. (This stuff is harder to clean up when spilled or dripped than RIT ever was because it dyes quicker. Be careful, keep some acetone on hand or be prepared for permanance.) 




 I did a gold line River with i-dye poly, and it's one of the best looking dyes that I have done. 




 The two most important things to remember about wind...

1. Wind acts on your disc like it would act on a wing. It's sort of counter-intuitive, but throwing into the wind results in an *increase* in wind speed, meaning your disc is *faster* and throwing with a tailwind means a *decrease* in speed, meaning your disc is *slower*.

2. Wind acts on your disc the most when the flight plate is exposed. Once you give the wind something to push, it will push it. So as your disc turns over, wind begins to work against the flight plate, either fighting or increasing any turn.


There's lots more about how your discs will work in the wind, and you have to go out and throw your discs to experience it. You can read up all you want, and that will help, but it won't make sense until you see it in action.
 




 Well.

I just don't know what to say about that.

I would say that I want my ten minutes of life back, but at the same time, I am completely willing to consider it a sacrifice to whatever YouTube Gods there may be to never allow me to watch something so confusing ever again.

Now, I am going to go drill three holes in a bridge over a creek, and stick my penis in them.

Thank you.

 A very interesting point, and one that I feel that I partially agree with. I don't know if both behaviors are because of nature trying to control population though.

I also feel that this argument needs to be divided...pedophilia is the attraction to the *prepubescent* while ephebophilia is the attraction to younger partners that are generally post-pubescent, but socially immature. The two are very different.

There have been some societies that have accepted pedophilia, the ancient Greeks probably the best known of those, but there have been other societies that have punished that behavior.

Ephebophilia, however, has been generally accepted up until fairly recently. 100 years ago it would be completely acceptable for a 30 year old man to marry a 15 year old girl, and the expectation is that she would bear children for him fairly quickly. It is just recently, as our society has changed, that that behavior has become unacceptable.

So, does homosexuality, pedophilia, and ephebophilia share the same genomic process, or is it changing societal pressures that define these issues?

Homosexuality has been generally accepted through the ages. See above for ephebophilia and why it is accepted. So why has pedophilia not been as accepted through the ages?

In short? Consent and protective behaviors.

It is hardwired into us to protect our young. Society may be able to define when a post-pubescent child is "of age" but nature defines the line between child/adult differently; by the ability to procreate. Pedophilia is the attraction to prepubescent humans, humans that by no definition are adult, either societal or natural, and that makes them children. And our nature requires that children be protected.

So, I feel that homosexuality and ephebophilia are very related: both are fairly "natural" (for lack of a better word), both genomic, both acted upon by societal pressures. (Simply meaning that some of this behavior has been accepted or not accepted based only on how society at large feels about that otherwise natural behavior.)

Pedophilia however, is very easily viewed as an act of aggression, from an adult human to a child human, and biological processes require that we protect our children, making this behavior unacceptable to most of us.

Leaving that, I do not believe that nature intends a certain part of the population to be homosexual, I believe that it is natural for a certain part of any population to *be* homosexual. I think it is part of us. I think that it would happen among smaller populations as well. (I don't have links handy, but homosexuality was well documented in the American Indian, and accepted, and through most of their history they were not acted on by population pressures.) Ephebophilia is a natural behavior as well, the only difference is whether one follows the morality of the society that declares these individuals off limits or not.

Pedophilia seems to be more about power and dominance than sexual urges. More like rape than preference. I think many more studies need to be done to help us understand pedophilia, but it would seem that this behavior comes from somewhere else in the brain. 

 




 Don't know the story, but it's not King, I know everything he's written very well. 
























 I didn't know that food was supposed to taste good until I was about ten or so.

That's when I started spending my summers with my grandmother, and oh yeah, Gran could cook.

What dish did I hate as a kid? All of them. My mothers idea of cooking was from the "heating things that come in cans until they are hot" school of culinary preparation. No butter. No seasoning. Nothing.

Be ten. Take a can of green peas. Dump then in a pan. Heat until hot. Now eat them. Go ahead. I fuckin' dare you.

Those sad shriveled green balls of mediocrity would sit on my plate, mocking me, knowing as well as I that I wasn't leaving the table until I ate them, and also knowing that I would rather eat paste then have to suffer another victim of my mom's reheating.

When I spent my first summer with my Gran, I remember quite clearly asking what kind of food she got, because it tasted so different. Fried chicken (she used mayonnaise instead of egg wash, try it, amazing) home canned vegetables, field fresh vegetables, so good, baked hams, with brown sugary glazes, and sauces! I didn't know about sauces! BBQ ribs! Fish fries! Potato au gratin, homemade! Bythegods its amazingness was only overshadowed by its awesomeness.

And then I went home.

Those fuckin' peas were waiting for me. Not good. I was ten, maybe eleven, and I told my mom how good Gran's cooking was. (It was my father's mother) 

It was not received well.

By my third summer or so, I asked Gran to teach me to cook. I helped cook dinner at home by the time I was 14. 

Now I'm a professionally trained chef, working in the business, and considering taking my Gran's recipes and working a cookbook that combines her love of food with her love of family, geared for family cooking; recipes that mom or dad can make that go with recipes that the kids can cook as well.

Thanks Gran. I wish I told you how much those times in the kitchen mattered to me before you died. And Gran Rusty, you should know that I have a  batch of your icebox pickles in my fridge right now...they're still my favorite snack.

 nothing but spread. It just sort of hangs out doing its fungus thing, you know, being ugly, making you uncomfortable in situations where you have to take your shirt off. I had it on my chest and belly. 




 They're spreading. They get darker/more pronounced when you exert yourself. They're slightly raised. 

Yep, it's a fungus.

I can't remember what it's called, but I had it. The doc told me it was related to athlete's foot (causing some lovely jokes about atheletes body, which I don't have, but did).

Doc prescribed me some super expensive ointment shite, but as I talked the nurse on my way out she recommended that I try something else first.

Head and shoulders. The anti-dandruff shampoo, the regular kind.

Use it as bodywash for a week or two. See if it helps. If it don't, off to the doc with you.

*I'm not a doctor, but I play one on Reddit. 









 If you're sure that it's printed/screenprinted/heatpressed on, (there is no indentation and the printing is invisible on the reverse side) the only thing that I would recommend trying is pure acetone...not nail polish remover, just the stuff they make nail polish remover out of.

Pure acetone. Get it at yer hardware store.

Start with the corner of a rag dipped in acetone, and work a corner of the plastic to make sure it won't damage the plastic...as long as the plastic holds up, you're good.

Keep in mind acetone does not "dissolve" ink...in that it doesn't make it go away; it just breaks down the "fixer" in the ink that makes it permanent. You can loosen the ink with acetone and then spread it around your media. Use small amounts, and work small areas, acetone-ing small patches and then picking up the ink as you go with a clean towel.

Good luck, use at your own risk. 







































 The stupid is strong with this one.

Also, he's the former Chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, primary House author of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, and chairman of the House-Senate energy conference committee. 

Annnnnddd...he's probably not an idiot; he's just pandering to his base to protect his real constituents: the oil and natural gas industries.

And here is the actual quote from committee: "Wind is Gods way of balancing heat. Wind is the way you shift heat from areas where its hotter to areas where its cooler. Thats what wind is. Wouldnt it be ironic if in the interest of global warming we mandated massive switches to energy, which is a finite resource, which slows the winds down, which causes the temperature to go up? Now, Im not saying thats going to happen, Mr. Chairman, but that is definitely something on the massive scale. I mean, it does make some sense. You stop something, you cant transfer that heat, and the heat goes up. Its just something to think about."

Oh yeah, and The organization Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) put Congressman Barton on its CREW's Most Corrupt Report 2011, for not accurately reporting investments in the natural gas industry which profited him $100,000. 




 Your brother has weird hobbies. 




 I like my wife to shave completely every now and again....but mostly I prefer that there just is no hair in my way.

For me, it's because I'm visually stimulated, like most men. I like it shaven every now and again simply for the view; I can see all of her, and that's what I like. Overall, I prefer a neatly trimmed bush, trimmed just for the ease of oral. 




 It might not be you....I'm just not a fan of kissing. 

My wife and I have spoken about it, and come to understand it; I don't mind kissing, but open mouth sloppy making out, it's just not my thing.

Might be that, or it might be something about the way you kiss...or oral hygiene...but don't let that stop you from talking to her. You won't know if you don't talk, and if things are good between you, it can only benefit the two of you to sit and communicate about this issue.

 I grew up on the West coast of Florida.

All through high school, my friends and I were semi-amateur skateboarders. (Way before Xgames made it cool to skate again.)

Each summer, we'd take a trip cross-state to the East coast for some surfing, and to skate the East coast scene.

I wasn't much of a surfer, I preferred wheels.

I was talked into going out on a pretty rough day. I could get up on the board, but that was about it.

One particular afternoon, after many beers and some 420 happytimes, we headed out into the surf. 

I paddled out, caught a few waves, wasn't really feeling it, (I just wasn't much of a surfer) just ended up sitting the board outside the break and enjoying my state of mind and the weather and the waves.

THE PAIN WAS IMMENSE AND IMMEDIATE. Searing white hot pain across my calf. I had no idea what had happened, I went into instant panic mode...I honestly think I Jesused across the waves instead of swimming in.

In a haze of high and sun and beer and pain, I was running in literal circles on the beach, screaming about how my leg had been bitten off by a shark. Running in circles, *on two perfectly good legs,* yelling about my missing leg, and how much it hurt. 

After some friends, some passer-bys and some lifeguards got me calmed down, they determined that I got hit by a jellyfish. Nasty sting, nasty swelling leg, non ending pain.

After an overnight stay in the hospital, we aborted our trip and headed back home.

After the story was spread around my friends, and their friends, and parents and neighbors and mailmen and the guy at the quicky-mart, I went back to school that first day to mocking cheers of "What's up Shark-boy?" and "Hey! Shark-attack!" and that sort of thing.

I wore the nickname of "Shark" for quite a long time after that, and with some pride, and even though I have left it behind me, I still have some friends that refuse to call me anything else.

 Link takes you to thank you page at end of survey.  





























 Absolutely with the lyrical ability, but I was having trouble with the comment running away with me and getting wordy.

One of my favorite little nugget of Dylan trivia is that the one-time Poet Laureate Andrew Motion once said that  "Visions of Johanna" was the greatest song lyric of all time.  




 Liking Bob Dylan's music, and understanding his place in music history is sometimes two different things. You can have a great amount of respect for his songwriting ability, and the reach of his influence, and not like the way his music sounds.

I am a fan, I like his raw emotional sound, and the way he sometimes feels like rhythm and meter are options not requirements. A lot of people can't handle that voice of his, all gravelly and indistinct, but for some of us, that's exactly what we're looking for.

When it comes to Dylan's music, standing alone, you either like it or you don't. Just because you understand that he's the [most covered artist of all time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_artists_who_have_covered_Bob_Dylan_songs), just because you understand that he basically invented folk-rock, just because you know that he has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame, that doesn't mean that you have to like the music.

It's easy to understand how he become such a fixture in the American psyche, not just for his music, but because when MLK gave his "I have a dream", Dylan wasn't in the crowd...he was on stage...having just sung "Blowin in the wind" and "Only a Pawn in Their Game".

He has the respect of so many musicians, and not just because of the body of work that he has produced, but because when other musicians at "Live Aid were preening their egos about how much they were helping Those Poor Starving Africans, he had the temerity to bring things a little closer to home by suggesting that perhaps some of the money might be used to pay the crippling mortgages that were putting American farmers out of business." Because of that, Willie Nelson was inspired to instigate Farm Aid. He also had the balls to take an electrified band on stage at the Newport Folk Fest, and after getting booed off the stage, keep working, and changed folk-rock. Again. After he pretty much invented it.

There's so much more that he has done, for music, for entertainment at large, that gives him a place in our music history:

He introduced the Beatles to Pot. (That was probably a good thing)

He dared to break the mold of the three-minute single, releasing six and seven minute songs.

Sure he's won Grammy's, but also won Golden Globes and an Oscar.

He took "The Hawks", turned them into his backup band, and gave birth to "The Band". (If you don't know who they are, look them up.)

He was asked to come up with some background music for a Western, and penned "Knockin on heaven's door". (Not bad...)

He is what he is, when it comes to what is recorded and played. You can like it, or not...but you do have to "get" Bob Dylan. There are arguments that he may be responsible for taking Rock and Roll and turning it into Rock music, giving birth to a movement. As a songwriter myself, I agree with the amazing Tom Waits when he called him "a planet to be explored... for a songwriter, Dylan is as essential as a hammer and nails and a saw are to a carpenter".

You can dislike his music, that's okay. Not everybody likes the way Dylan sounds. But just be careful that you don't confuse the music with the man. The person that won the 2008 Pulitzer Prize Special Citation for "profound impact on popular music and American culture, marked by lyrical compositions of extraordinary poetic power" might just make music that you just don't care for, and that's okay.

Sorry so wordy. I'm a big fan. 









 Not really. But I have found a way to slow some of it down.

Junk mail is so prevalent because of cost. Junk mailers pay a low rate for bulk mailings making it cost effective to send out tons of shit every week. Some junk mail contains return envelopes that allow you to respond to offers by returning the card or envelope to the company that mailed it.

**Junk mailers do not get a discounted rate on return mail**. They accept the increased cost as part of doing business with you.

Any time that I get a piece of mail that has one of those pre-paid envelopes or cards on them, I send it in. Sometimes I write a joke on them. Sometimes I just write **NO** really big. Doesn't matter, I send it off, sometimes empty. 

I have noticed over time that I get less offers of these types, so I have to assume that somewhere there is someone keeping track. 




 Google that shitty country song "Don't take the girl" if you don't know it. I think that is what you are talking about, but I don't know what that device is called. 




 It's hard for a man to admit that he likes to watch My Little Porny or some such. 




 First: why do you assume every girl hopes that her man doesn't watch porn? Pornography can and is a healthy part of a sexual relationship for many couples.

Second: A man who says he doesn't watch porn usually is embarrassed of the porn he watches. It's very rare to find a man that isn't into porn of some kind. They exist, but they're rare.

Third: Start watching porn that you like in front of him. Search out types of porn that you normally wouldn't watch, and engage him. Show him that you are totally okay with the most offbeat porn you can find and see what he responds to. (I don't care for 'regular porn'. I have a very sexually adventurous wife who loves getting freaky in all kinds of different ways, so most porn doesn't do it for me. I like to watch the weird shit; not because it turns me on, but because it's something that I don't see at home. (No honey, I don't want to watch you pee on an octopus, I just want to watch three Asian girls do that.)) 




 High-five her on the buttcheeks.

Saw you guys multiple times at Floyd's Music Store in Tallahassee. (I even drunk-peed on the front tire of your bus one time, sorry about that!) So glad you guys have stuck it out together for so long, and still are putting out great music, and I love that you're doing what you're doing with Feed The Children. It's good to see folks using fame/money for good works.

So, question:

As artists with some modest success, are you and the gang doing the Feed The Children thing because you are finally able to (financially, time-wise, etc.) or because you feel like you owe the world a little something back for being graced with the ability to rock for a living?

 Can't speak for other men specifically...

Me personally, it's not about the "facial" so much, as seeing myself cum. Having masturbated a lot before ever even coming close to having sex with a woman, I associate my orgasm with the view of myself cumming. My wife doesn't care for the facial at all, and I don't mind that, but every now and then I do like to "watch" myself cum, and we've worked out a compromise that works for us both. 
 

I have done the whole facial thing before however, and again without speaking for other men, I also felt a little bit of that shame/guilt feeling. How could it feel so good to do something like that to someone that I cared about? Strange. You and SO should talk.

Finding out that someone out there likes what I do, at least enough to listen, is an additional reward.

 That's the tough part. Simple designs you can eyeball. You could also used fixed point reckoning, or registration marks.

One way is to use uncut vinyl over part of the disc that won't be died. Cut a small "v" notch in the center of that piece. Before you stick the other stencils on your discs, center and cut matching "pointer" notches on each of your stencils. Use these fixed points to help line up each successive stencil.

I've heard of other dyers using laser pointers to line up the center of the disc, but the vinyl that I use for stencils is way too thick for that.

A stencil for each color that you're doing, with just the single color that you're working on cut out on each one.

 Everbody's different, so I'll just have to talk about my balls. In my experience, its a sudden smack type of contact that causes pain.

But just a light, sudden, tap causes sharp pain, along with harder squeezes, or smooshing/crushing. (Guys, ever sat on your balls? Damn, that sucks.)

 You are sort of half right. A lot of retailers will package meat with C02 to prevent oxidization in meats...it could be because of faulty packaging that 02 was able to get to your meat, which could maybe be a small cause for alarm from a food safety point of view. You didn't mention whether this was out of the package, where it was bought, what sort of packaging it had, or what you've done to it since bringing it home from the store. But most likely just simple oxidization of some safe to consume meat.
 




 Oxidation. (From the USDA Site) Oxygen from the air reacts with meat pigments to form a bright red color which is usually seen on the surface of meat purchased in the supermarket. The pigment responsible for the red color in meat is oxymyoglobin, a substance found in all warm-blooded animals. Fresh cut meat is purplish in color. The interior of the meat may be grayish brown due to lack of oxygen; however, if all the meat in the package has turned gray or brown, it may be beginning to spoil.

I don't have a brown thumb but it's not exactly green either. What do I need to know for small container flowers like this, and what's the best flowering plants for such a small container. (I live in East Central FL, indoors is not air-conditioned often) 




 A lot of these sound just a bit dirty...

 Yup. Rest of the movie's great...just don't watch him "play". Doubly offensive if your a musician of any caliber, and especially so for sixstringers. 




 Check out the awesome documentary called [Dogs Decoded](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN96Gid6Kjo) from NOVA. Worth the hour. 




 Sean Penn in [Sweet and Lowdown](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0158371/). Great movie about a fictional guitarist who idolizes [Django Reinhardt](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoIJ4W7kXiQ). Funny, clever, great music, super story...but Sean Penn [can't even come close to faking it](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxVbXzQToI)...(takes about :40 to get to, but the music is nice.) His terrible faking almost ruined the movie for me. Still recommend watching it, though. 




 Yeah, that's not how America works. Comcast will have many places where they are the only provider worth a damn, and if they are not the only provider they may own most of the transmission lines and can charge the other companies so much to use the transmission lines that they have to charge more than Comcast....so people feel forced to use Comcast. It's a mess. 

Where I live I have two choices. Out of the tens of companies providing internet access, I have two choices. That's it. Well, three, I could pay for a high-end satellite based internet, but yeah, two choices. 




 Aha! So there is a difference...it's not a one or done kind of thing. Yes, I will head over to r/sextoys and see if I can get a wider response. Thanks! 




 She's not overly sensitive...and I don't think that she ever said that it hurts, just that she goes sort of numb....I wondered about the differing quality of vibrators as well...

 




 My wife and I, in our fulfilling quest for sexual gratification, have begun to experiment with a little bdsm/bondage play. I like to take my wife a little out of her comfort zone, and she likes to experience new things.

In previous conversations she has told me that she does not enjoy masturbation/stimulation with vibration. We have not experimented much with vibration because of that.

In our bondage play, I would like to introduce vibration, but it should be pleasurable, not punishment.

So here's my question(s). Is masturbation or stimulation with vibration a learned skill? Or is it more something that works for some of you and not for others? Care to share some stories about your like/dislike of vibration play?

Saying all that, I of course will talk with my wife before anything happens, but I am curious what the community here might advise for me, and for her. (She's on reddit, and subbed here, so I won't be surprised to see her pop a comment in.)

Thanks! 




 If the phrase "unregulated data" doesn't scare you now, I have a feeling that it will in the future. 




 My wife and I had gov't assistance at one point in our lives. I was between jobs, and moving out of the city I lived in. There was one point as I moved up in my career that I just made enough money to disqualify the children from medical assistance. I called to ask, really just being surly, why it was that the 50$ too much that I made would take away hundreds of dollars in benefits, and after much talk of tables and earnings, she did tell me that I could have another child, and at the income level I was at, that would qualify my family for all sorts of benefits.

It wasn't exactly the advice I was looking for; and it painted a very interesting picture of the welfare system at large.

 Be careful with public exhibition in your own home. There have been a few cases of people getting arrested, or harassed by police, if the wrong person sees and contacts the police. IMO for the inexperienced, cam is the way to start. 









 Assuming you have no problem getting the other half of that pin out without messing up the hole, get new bridge pins. They're cheap and relatively easy to find. I just upgraded my six acoustic to brass pins, and my twelve acoustic to chrome pins, total cost was about $15-20 including shipping.
 




 Socks first. Always. 









 Good on you, Dad. Well written and well said. More of us should learn to express ourselves well so that our voices are heard clearly. I hope you see a difference next year. 














 I use the adhesive vinyl...on the top left if I remember correctly. You need sticky on one side cutter vinyl...most of the sign vinyl on that page will work. I use black because I can see the white backing paper through my cuts just a little bit easier than any other colors, but color doesn't matter. 









 Hmm...lots to work with here.

"Captain Phillips" would need some rum based islandish cocktail

"Polar Express" could give you a nice frozen drink, maybe with mint? 

"Cast Away" Yes. Coconuts. Pina Coladas maybe?

"The Green Mile" Anything green. Creme de menthe, apple liquers, midori melon liquer.

"Forest Gump" How about a Gumptini? Chocolate martini with a chocolate garnish?

"A League of Their Own" Baseball = Beer. Serve with peanuts.

"Joe versus the Volcano" Mai Tais! 

And for the truly tasteless, because this is Reddit, the "Philadelphia"...a small shot of some red liquer.
 




 But it sure would be fun to watch! The way you guys played this year, I'd give you that one...outstanding job.

 I had read another article that talked about Hughes idea for the sequels. Basically checking in every 10 years or so, through the actors natural (and Hughes') lives.  


































 Right on. Currently on the last night of a long weekend without my SO and two kiddies...just off work, listening to some 80's rock, chillin' with the puppies, beerin' up, and surprise: on Reddit. Pretty much what I did with most of my free time the last couplethree days. 














 /u/calibur_ 's post is funny, but also completely true. You need relationship counseling, and sooner rather than later. 

I checked out your overview, and I see that you're subbed in /r/Christianity...have you though of seeking help through that sub...though I imagine that you will get much the same message there...with a fair amount of "Let go and Let God" which will probably be of little help at this point.

Do you have a trusted family member or counselor/pastor/preacher at church? I would suggest that route for you and your family.

Whatever you decide, please do it soon. Your daughter's behavior is most likely normal teenage troubles, but the emotional distance in your relationship and the way that you apparently feel about it worries me.

Reach out to someone if you need help; someone IRL, not just here on Reddit.
 
























 I recently had an issue with my 10yo son...he had been sneaking downstairs at night to play videogames. I got curious what exactly he was doing after catching him a couple times, and saw that he was going online to play flashgames. So we sat and had the "internet talk" (who knew that was going to be a thing?) and told him about how going on line was a public event, not a private event. We talked a little about the dangers of predation, but mostly about how bad programs could get downloaded onto the computer that could harm us. I had no intention of doing so, but apparently I terrified him of using the PC! Trying to manage balancing between being safe, and being connected is our new challenge at home. 




 Outstanding article. Thanks for sharing. I have been saying these same things for quite awhile. It's nice to see someone smarter than me saying the same thing.

 I'm glad it's not just me. I like the editing/translating of articles in the target language aspect of Duolingo, but other than that I struggle to stay interested in the site. Many of the sentences just don't make sense, and it adds another level of disconnect...I have found in real conversations with people in my target language I can make some educated guesses about the content based on what a normal person might say, and the way a normal person would construct sentences, and that becomes part of my learning when I find my assumptions are correct, I can file away another word or phrase I don't know, as opposed to trying to guess why someone would say something so ridiculous as your sentence examples show.

What do you think about Memrise? It's user generated, so the good is with the bad there, but I use that site far more than Duolingo recently. 




 Practice.

Sorry, there is no hack. Work with songs you like, and know well, that are easier than your current skill level, and practice them. 

The one piece of actual advice I have is to let mistakes happen, and don't stop. Play each time like someone is listening. It will help you to learn to cover your mistakes, and view the song as one piece, not a collection of a thousand things that all have to be done correctly.

Get off reddit and get back to practicing. 




 Found it. [Here's a Scientific American article overview of the information](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/2010/06/17/music-and-speech-share-a-code-for-c-2010-06-17/), and [here's a link to the actual paper from the study.](http://ase.tufts.edu/psychology/music-cognition/pdfs/Curtis%26Bharucha2010Emotion.pdf) (long PDF file.) 




 Ha. I've been looking for it for a minute now. I will post it if/when I find it. It was a while ago, and I want to say that it might have been TED related, but damn if I can find it.
 




 I had recently read about an experiment that a music researcher did at some college. I don't have the link bookmarked anywhere, so excuse me if I paraphrase, but the researcher invited professional voice actors to come in and record simple phrases.

One was a happy phrase, and one was a sad phrase.

The researcher discovered that the voice actors, no matter what nationality, background, or accent, invariably dropped the last one or two syllables of the sad phrase a minor third, while the happy phrase stayed in the major.

The article talks about this a bit at the very end, but perhaps the children rhyming phrases mimic our natural tendency to drop our voice a minor third when delivering sad information, and music has simply developed alongside language to mirror that minor third drop to emulate the negative side of emotional communication.

 MIDI is Musical Instrument Digital Interface. What it does in its simplest form, is it records data from your musical instrument (Drum, keys, guitar, anything MIDI enabled) and stores it digitally. 

The information that it stores is the notation, pitch, duration, force (or velocity) along with a bunch of other parameters like clocktime, cues, panning, and other information.

What makes MIDI so useful, is that the way this information is stored allows you to make adjustments to any or all of this information.

Example: You can record a few notes of your guitar through MIDI. The digital signature of how hard you hit the notes (velocity, or force), how long the note was recorded (duration), and where on the fretboard that note exists (pitch) can be saved as digital data, and then a sound can be applied to that information on a DAW (that allows you to manipulate MIDI information). You can then record farting noises through a microphone, upload it to a MIDI processor, use that to replace the sound of your guitar, and now your guitar is a tuned fart-box. You can also use a MIDI processor that will emulate whatever sounds (farts or not) that you have loaded in real-time, turning any MIDI instrument into a multi-instrument, multi-sound emulator.

You can also manipulate the data in many other ways, fixing sour notes, changing the velocity or duration of the note, applying any number of sounds to the digital information, etc, etc. 

[Here's the Wikipedia overview of MIDI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI)

 Yeah, no problems there, just keep practicing. 

I roll my index finger forward just a bit when fingering (teehee) barre chords, so that I'm not just pressing down with the meat of my index, but the thinner side of the finger. That's just my preference. 

Keep practicing. Hand strength is key.

Do you have the same problems with other barre forms? Like the G at fret3? 

While you practice, you can use the cheater forms too...

There's XX3211. It's a weak F, doesn't sound as good or as full as the barre, but it can get you through a song until your hand is strong.

There's also X3321X. I cheat that one when my hand gets tired...lol. Sounds a bit fuller than the other guy up there, but still missing that full sound of a barre.

Keep practicing. Work on hand strength. (Seeing a pattern?)

Good luck. 




 First: Relax. Focus on the simple things. Find what you're good at and focus on those things.

Second: Discuss this with your wife (most important) and your/her family (assuming they're a loving and supporting bunch) and they will tell you essentially the same thing. Relax. Love her. Be there. Do what you can.

Third: There are other ways to help. If you don't feel comfortable in direct baby care, focus on support care. If the wife's feeding the baby, you're washing and sanitizing bottles/blankets/etc. If the wife's putting the baby to sleep, you're reading the story or singing the song. If your wife's the one changing the nappies, then you're the one cleaning baby's room. Sure she's frustrated, but there are a million other things that you can be doing...even if the only thing you can do is reduce your wife's workload around the house so that she can focus on the baby care issues that you are not comfortable with.

My experience: I participated in baby care, but I never felt comfortable with it. I found ways to be proactive and involved, but honestly, it just sort of felt like work. Now that the kids are older, I get to help with homework, and social problems, and arts and crafts, and so many other things that I *am* good at. They're only babies for a little while, don't get hung up on the little things. 

Short answer: Love her. Love your wife. Love your family. And don't forget the most important thing that new parents forget...you need a little time to yourself, and so does she. Make that happen, too.

Good luck, dad. Don't be nervous. Dads have been doing their dad thing for a long long time. Find where you excel, and rock it.

Now go talk to your wife. 







































 Exactly. This is how people are starting to watch TV. I don't think that we need to go backwards into a surfable streaming content destination. If we wanted that, why not just pay for cable?  
































































 Check out [this post](http://www.reddit.com/tb/ec75w) from u/Warly and get an idea of how chord progressions work over keys to understand the "1-4-5" (or more appropriately the "I-IV-V".

 A lot of my fears were self-esteem fears in the past. Not being good enough to find real love. Not finding happiness in my life.

I've found most of those things, and now I am a father, and all my fears are for my children now. Every. Single. One.

It's the most rewarding and most terrifying thing ever. 




 Dude. Really. Do you need Reddit to tell you to run like the wind? You already put your dick in crazy, and you can't unfuck that, but I don't think you need anything to do with this girl, fuckbuddy, friend, or gf.

Just my opinion. (Experience: I've fucked more crazy than the American Health Care system.) 




 Because the US is hell bent on *convincing* Americans how loyal we are to our returning injured troops. They have no interest in *actually* doing anything, especially if they know they can get the same knee jerk flag waving reaction they want if they just tell us that they love the troops.

If they cared about the troops at all, the VA system would not be the struggling, under-budget, paperbased mess that it is.

If they cared about the troops at all, they would have wanted to find out why the suicide rate increased so rapidly after DS Gates instituted the Stop-Loss Programs, and more importantly, why they didn't decrease after draw down.

If they cared about the troops at all, they wouldn't have cut SNAP benefits, as many of our troops, active and retired, rely on food benefits to feed their families.

Or maybe if they cared about the troops at all, they wouldn't have sent our sons and daughters to fight in wars that did nothing but protect the profits of a select group of corporations.

Our politicians wrap themselves in the American Flag, the put their hands over their hearts, and they say all the right words in all the right places, and for some reason we are willing to believe every second of it, even though there are piles of evidence to the contrary. 




 Tough question on a Sunday afternoon....

Short answer, yeah, Piracy is stealing.

I think a lot of here find ourselves in the weird grayspace of being both a content creator and a content consumer. The creator in me wants to believe that I can make it rich doing what I love, but I know that the best I can hope for is to make a living, and even that is a long shot. The consumer in me, however, recognizes the disconnect in money paid for music and money given to the artist. I don't pirate (okay maybe casually) but I also don't pay for music either. Most of what I listen to and enjoy is more local and small and they usually are happy just to get the listens, so they put music up for free. Like, /u/tomj1990 , I find myself going to the shows, putting up the dollars at the merch table, and knowing that I'm helping them get down the road to the next show.

You mentioned ethics and responsibility, and I agree, there's a disconnect there in modern users, but the "old way" where the men in suits get far more of the dough than the man on stage isn't something I want to go back to.

The point that I took a really long time to get to, is that maybe teaching ethics and responsibility isn't the entire answer: maybe it's teaching content consumers to seek out ways to pay the original artists, and helping content creators think up new ways to source revenue for their work, without involving the giant corporate structure that drives the price of content so high. (Many of the twentysomethings that I talk to don't recognize that they're stealing from the artist, but actively accept that they are stealing from "those corporate bastards".) 









 That was the happiest I've been all year. Annnnnddd...what the fuck Ron Jeremy's Belly Button? 














 No prob. I love my state, as messed up as it can be.

There's good surf in Miami as well, I'm just not as familiar with the spots. Yes, sharks are a concern, but a minor one. New Smyrna is the sharkbite capital, and most of them come from surfers at the inlet hopping off boards and landing on top of cruising sharks...usually small, though we did have a great white about 40 miles off shore this last weekend!

Water temp today here in NSB is 64F. Cold, but doable. Only warmer as you go south.

Couple other things about FL....don't drink and drive, don't get caught with weed. Public drinking is usually a no, but check where you're at, it's okay some places.

If you're into live music at all, check out some local bars in the St. Pete/Tampa/Ybor City area. Great music all over the place.

So many other things that are cool about FL, glad to hear you're skipping the whole Disney experience. Lots of local roadside types of attractions all over the state.

Most of us are cool, but you will be dealing with several different types of people. People in Orlando are different from Miami folks, and the people that you would meet in Crystal River or up near the Itchnetucknee are backwoods redneck for sure. But as long as you don't talk politics or religion, talk to the locals. Orlando/Miami/St Pete/Tampa/Ybor City all have areas that are just not safe for non-locals. Don't go to sketchy places. And things can get sketchy quick. One city block is art and restauants, and the next is crack houses and hookers. 

Feel free to ask anything specific, now or during your trip. Like I said, I love FL, and would be glad to help. 
























 Yeah, my kids haven't seen this yet. Fixing that tonight.
 



















 I'm the only wage earner in my family of four, and we recently found out our home (rental) sold...and we have 40 some days to get out. Things are progressing nicely, but it worries me at night...anything goes wrong in the next couple weeks would be a tragedy level event...

My kids are 5 and 7...my five yo girl doesn't want to move, and I worry for her...hoping that she adjusts to the move well.

Other than that, I'm good. The usual worries; losing my job, hoping the car makes it another year, the health of my family, my long term outlooks, our retirement. 

Jesus, I've got a lot to worry about. Thanks. 









 Yeah, I know....but it just looks so good. After outperforming Pierce and going up against that Pitt defense...could be a decent performance. 
 



















 When someone wrongs us, there are two possible places to lay the blame; on ourselves, or on the person that wronged us.

This quote focuses on us, assuming that we already are forgiving of the person that wronged us, but reminds us not to think negatively of the decisions that we made that put us in the position to be hurt or treated badly by this other person.

We already don't hate him, but don't hate yourself for lettin' him hate you, you dig. 




 Depends on where in Florida you're going. The state of Florida has a rich history, with many different museums focusing on the different places in history that Florida has figured. From Ocean Pond in Olustee, in the north, site of one of only two Civil War battles fought in Florida, and certainly the bloodiest, to the Seminole Rez outside of Okeechobee, in the south, home of the last survivors of the Seminole Indians, a proud race that never submitted to the US.

Cape Canaveral and Kennedy Space Station in the mid-east of the state is America's Space Station. Can't go wrong there! 

On the mid-west coast, you have everything from the Ringling Museum in Sarasota to the Dali in St. Petersburg. Ft. Desoto, south of Tampa Bay, is an post-Augustine-era defense fort where you can learn about the first Europeans in Florida. 

Or just check out St. Augustine itself...in the northeast, site of possibly one of the oldest European presences on the state. (There is some evidence that Turnbull's site in New Smyrna Beach might be the oldest.)

This isn't even close to an all-inclusive list. Anywhere that you look in Florida, you will find some history. You might want to narrow your trip down, and then check the county website for the area(s) you are interested in visiting.  














 Unplug it.

Then use needle nose pliers. First, try to grip one end of the metal thingamabob and turn it that way, and if that doesn't work, use the pliers the opposite way....instead of to pinch, expand them to fill the metal thingamabob and try to twist it out that way.

Or, live dangerously, and after unplugging the lamp, cut a potato in half, jam it into the socket, and twist. It should pull the broken light bulb out with it. You must clean the socket before reusing, and for fuck's sake, dry your hands before plugging the lamp back in.

Don't forget to unplug the lamp.

 If two men are standing outside a bar on the street and having a fight, and one man gets the  better of the other, and the losing guy pulls a gun, then doesn't the guy winning the fight then have the right to shoot the loser of the fight? If I'm standing there watching, and I see that the loser of the fight pulls a gun to protect himself, and then the winner of the fight pulls a gun to protect himself from the loser of the fight, don't I have a right to shoot the both of them to protect myself from becoming an innocent bystander? If I pull my gun to protect myself from the now two armed fighters from accidentally shooting me, wouldn't you have the right as another bystander to shoot the three of us?

 I play a local short course as my home course as well. It would all depend on how you approached me. I play fairly well, but a local regular stopped me on the turn one afternoon and said that he was watching me play and thought that he could help me take three to four strokes off my game. Then he asked if I'd like to play a round with him at some other time. I took him up on it, and played a round at our course and a round at our local pro course, and he gave me a couple of tips. They didn't take those three to four strokes off my game, but it helped.

We don't do an allowance per se, but I monetize certain awards and achievements. They often receive money as gifts, either birthday/christmas money, or just randomly when I have a couple of bucks in my pocket. We're not big consumers, we focus instead on making things and arts and crafts. I'm not anti allowance by any means, but just haven't seen the need for a stricter definition of it. Glad to change that as the kids get older.

As for hitting, we have always said that they have the right to defend themselves, but they must exhaust every other option first.  



















 I agree with much of what you say. I cruised through scope.com after running into this article, and there is much there that is well intentioned but perhaps goes to far.

 Florida Citizen: ' I strongly urge' Jeb Bush to shut the fuck up. 




 What the surveillance video shows is Brown having an altercation with the shopkeeper. It may have been about a robbery...of a fifty dollar box of cigars. So, in OP's opinion, as long as you're a suspect in a minor strong arm robbery, it's completely okay to be gunned down in the street, even after you've surrendered. Stop defending the actions of the domestic military police, OP. Even if you're a criminal, you still have rights. Right to a trial. Right to confront your accuser. Right to hear your charges. There is no right of the police to decide you're guilty and execute you in the street.

I understand your comment about Sharpton. He and his ilk swarm to stories like this to forward their own initiatives. But your comment "No surprise really..." (that was quickly edited) shows that we need a whole lot more people like the ones that working hard to show this story in the light of the very real racism and double standards that exist in our society.

We heard this same nonsense when Martin was shot in Florida. It didn't matter that a man had died once we understood that Martin was probably carrying or using drugs. Now we see the Ferguson authorities releasing information about this possible robbery even though they are tight lipped about the shooting. Why? Because we don't have to care about the death of another black man if he was "just another criminal."

 I've always thought so. It provides a connection to the food you eat, or the products that you use, that you don't get when just picking the shiniest thing off the grocery shelf, and many of these things are becoming further and further removed from our collective memory...(There was nothing on this list that was remarkable, I've made most of them myself at one point or another) and there may be a time where you find  yourself without power, or unable to reach a store, and being able to provide some basic comforts in that situation certainly will bring yourself some joy and contentment, don't you think?

 Food service manager here. Not a bad LPT. I have changed my mind about my impression of employees based on comments from guests. I can't see it all, feedback is important. 














 Former server, Guest services manager checking in here. 

The absolute worst waste of time in any servers night is when a table starts arguing about who is paying the check. 

If you are the only one to sneak a card to the server, this LPT will work, but other people in your party may want to try the same thing, and this just leads to a clusterf**k tableside for any server. The best bet is to have this figured out early, or if unclear, split the check evenly. Most restaurants have an easy 5050 payment option at their CC terminals.

I will say that when one of my servers comes to me and complains that they have a table arguing over who is going to pay the bill, I tell them that our policy is to respect whoever submitted payment first (no such policy) so your early card may work.

 I don't know exactly what you're looking for, but here are two of my favorite food bourn illnesses. Neither are germs, Anisakiasis is a parasitic infection, and CJD is a prionic disease, caused by a folded protein called a prion.

[Anisakiasis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anisakis#Anisakiasis) is a parasitic infection. You get it from improperly prepared fish that's infected with a nemtode. You can end up with bowel blockage from the resulting parasitic infection, sometimes requiring surgery to remove.

[CJD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creutzfeldt%E2%80%93Jakob_disease), or mad human disease, and other related neurodegenerative diseases. Similar to mad cow. Super scary because of these folded proteins called Prions, [which are notoriously hard to destroy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prions#Sterilization) compared to other pathogens, and the fact that they are not alive like a germ/microbe/virus, but are still able to create copies of themselves by folding other proteins. Can only be controlled by removing them from the food supply. Most institutional cleaning and cooking practices do not remove prions.

 














 Actually, this is an infographic that  shows how just a few companies own all the products that are on your grocery shelves. [Check out this article from last year](http://gprl6105.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/media_consolidation.jpg) that explains how just a few companies own all the media that you consume.

There isn't one (or a few) companies that control everything, it's more about the loss of choice in the marketplace, no matter what product that you're talking about. [George Carlin does a great piece on the Illusion of Choice.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SC_wjQtfhZQ) NSFW, obviously, the specific part about choice starts around 3:30, but watch the whole thing anyway. It's great.

 Welcome. Good luck. Too many people out there take foodservice, and foodservice management specifically, as a bullshit job. It's not. To do it right takes an intensive skill set, both physical and mental, and looooong hours. But it has it's rewards.

The only thing else that I'll add, regarding down time, is learn to leave the job at the door. Set boundaries with staff and other management, and make sure that when you're off, you're off. That's your downtime, and it's terribly important. 




 I never make it that obvious, and I commend far more than I offer negative reinforcement. I can see how PNP suggestive correction can become Pavlovian, but only when the only time you receive positive reinforcement is when negative reinforcement is coming on the heels of it. I stay positive, and point out positive often, and when I have to offer negative correction, the PNP form just naturally follows. Better if I said always follow negative correction with positive reinforcement.  




 Assuming that you want to be successful, the first thing I will say is trying to keep everyone happy is a guarantee to fail. It's not your job to keep everyone happy, it's to keep everyone on task and working effectively.

Saying that, here's some advice from 20+ years service management.

* **Set goals**. Talk to your service staff, and explain clearly what the expectation is. Whether it's some small extra cleaning project, or a special you want mentioned, whatever it is, tell staff ahead of shift what your expectation is. Don't forget to set goals for yourself, and follow through on them.

*  **Follow up**. As you work through any shift, or any week, follow up on the goals that you have set. If you have asked servers to mention a new special at every table, take time to listen to each server and make sure that they are. If they aren't meeting the goals that you have set, ask them why. At the end of the shift, take time to point out with each server that you noticed them achieving the goals you set, or not, as the case might be.

*  **Don't get in the way**. You have to be proactive in your management of staff, but take care that you are not preventing them from getting the job done. You have been FOH so  you know you are there to make money. Don't lose respect by doing anything that can cost your servers time, because time is money.

* **Correct on site**. If you see something, say something. Be brief, but concise, when you need to correct behavior. *Take care not to do this in front of other staff, unless you see it as a teaching moment that other staff can benefit from. No one likes to be singled out.*

* **Be first, be last**. You are the first one on a problem, and you finalize the issue. If there's a spill, you're the first on task. That doesn't mean that you clean it up, it means you're the first one there, looking for a busser/utility to get mops/wet floor signs/towels, directing staff to handle problems. You finalize the problem by making sure everything is taken care of, signs put away, mop taken off the floor, and at the end of the shift, reinforcing your policies for how you want your staff to handle spills. (That's a small example, but be  first be last is really some of the best advice I can give you. Apply it to everything. You have to be the first to notice something, the first to handle something, and the last person to deal with it, to make sure it is handled the way you/your restaurant wants it to be handled. Follow up with staff about whatever incident it was, and then move on. Don't beat a dead horse.)

*  **Positive, negative, positive**. It's cliche, but when counseling an employee, remember this pattern. Tell them something that they do well, compare that to something that they don't do well, and encourage them to do better with positive thinking/acting/speaking. (Ex: If you have to talk about an employee's complete lack of pre-bussing tables, start with "You know what, employee? You might be one of the best upsellers in the house. But it would help all of us if you could be a little more mindful of prebussing. If you apply yourself to prebussing your tables like you do to upselling, you'll be the best at that too." Cheesy example, but it gets the idea across.)

* **Don't ask anyone to do anything you wouldn't do yourself**. And prove it occasionally. 

* **No Down Time!** If you have free time, you haven't been planning correctly. Spend that time working on ideas, like staff comps, which are a great idea btw, or planning the next half of your shift, or your next shift, or your next week. Down time is your enemy. (It is important to take breaks occasionally, but breaks are different from down time.)

And lastly, if you truly want to be successful, you have to be the best. If you want your servers to be better cleaners, then you have to be the cleanest. If you want them to be quicker about greeting guests when they're sat, then you have to race them to the table. You can't just ask people to do things and expect that they will do them. You have to lead. And that's the hardest part. A leader leads, a boss bosses. Lead effectively, and they will follow. Boss, and they will resent you. 

Oh, and remember to ask. It's your job to tell the server that he has to mop his section. It's his job to do what you tell him and mop his section. Neither of those facts should change human decency. Remember to ask the server to do what you want. If he doesn't, then fall back on the bossman routine. (I learned that lesson at 19 in QSR from a fifty year old woman that I didn't ask. She reminded me that we were both human, and I don't forget that, ever.)

 I would have had your back. The girl with the shot and no ID should have been put out immediately. And, if I couldn't find out which one of the other party gave her the shot, the rest would have been put out as well, unless one of them owned up and I could put him/her out specifically.

Side story: When working in a counter service restaurant in a college town about ten-fifteen years ago, I had one of my girls not ID during a sting. Good employee, almost friend, dumb mistake. I went with her through all the nonsense and meetings and court dates, just so I could get a real taste of what that's like. I will not put myself or my employees at risk at all because of that experience. Her experience cost her about three days work requested off for various meetings and court dates (About $100 bucks a shift), $250 in court fees/fines, six months probation with supervision costs at $25 a month = about a $700 mistake. (The house paid half, just cuz we were like that.) 














 Ummm, really? She might be guilty of making a bad decision but she's not at all guilty of her own rape. 

Whenever you start to think about this sort of thing, put yourself in that situation, and think about it like a mugging. (They are not the same, let's just use that example.)

"If a dude drank too much and passed out at a party and a criminal mugged them, is the man 0% at fault?"

or if you prefer

"If you yourself drank too much and passed out at a party, and some dude fucked you in your ass while you were passed out, would you be 0% at fault?"

This idea states that a woman can never cut loose and have a good time at a party because she might drink too much, and if she passes out and gets raped, it's kinda a little her fault. That doesn't sound right, does it? It's the same argument that leads to people thinking that a short skirt is a reason for rape, or a bad neighborhood, or being flirty, or changing your mind about hooking up with someone. 

The better question to ask here is why should a woman have to fear getting raped at some party? Throw better parties with better people. If she passes out at my party the worst that might happen is she'll be tucked in all safe and comfy in the guest bedroom without her permission.

 




 I'm curious what you all think about this as well. My place is set up the same way, four-top only sections, six-top only sections, and tables for pushing. I look at the numbers, and they really seem to match-up fairly well. Turning for volume will net as much as a big party in sales, and depending on customers, tips seem about the same, but I have a pretty big disparity in what my servers prefer. 
























 Yes, absolutely. We love allergy cards, and advance notice by phone or at the door. We actually work very hard on allergen awareness and safety, and we were way ahead of the curve in comparison to other restaurants. That's partially why it's so frustrating; to put so much hard work into something, and have it derailed by poorly informed individuals. We have a guidelines book where we talk about food allergens and our ingredients are broken down for each item on the menu across the eight common allergens, and have resources for the kitchen for the less common allergens. We have team members that are trained to "go to the book" to look up allergy information when a server or manager needs to know about less common allergies. 

A perfect example of how this behavior puts people in danger is when we had a three top in the dining room, with one person claiming to be "allergic to gluten" (always introduce yourself as a Celiac first, then explain what that means to be taken seriously immediately) and one of the other guests claiming to be allergic to pepper. The server asked the gluten allergic customer whether it was an intolerance or Celiacs to determine whether cross-contamination would be an issue in her diet and was met with a blank stare and a comment along the lines of "I just can't have gluten"...she dismissed the table as "one of those" and followed our procedures for ingredient preferences as opposed to allergies. The second lady was served a steak, ordered without pepper, that was cross contaminated with pepper in the cooking process. I was doing FOH that night, and had to deal with the poor lady as her face began to inflate from her pepper allergy. Depressing to miss an easy opportunity for success when so much work is put into it. 




 This allergy shit is out of control. I know Oprah said it on her show, and I've seen it in magazines as well...in one of those sections like "Restaurant Life Hacks, Getting the Perfect Order Every Time!" or some such nonsense.  

These damn near criminals suggest that if you don't want an ingredient in your dish that you tell your server that you are allergic to that ingredient, and that way they'll make sure that the ingredient is left out, because we don't want to kill anybody. Right?

These folks who wrote it, and all these customers who use this terrible advice every day don't understand that every time a story like /u/xnick58  happens, us BOH folks give just a slight shit less about the next time a server comes back there telling us that someone is allergic to something.

I've been in the business for almost thirty years now...in the last four years or so it's like there's been an outbreak of food allergy, of epic proportions! Why isn't this front page news? Apparently every blue hair in my city is fucking allergic to something, and none of those things are ever the eight commonest....it's always parsley or some such. Who the fuck is allergic to parsley! For fucks sake. And don't get me started on the gluten train. 

These people don't get that there are people out there that have real food allergies. The kind where if you eat a certain kind of food, you might fuckin die! Not bad gas because you're dairy intolerant, but can't fuckin' breathe, my throat is closing up, holy shit I'm dying food allergies. I work as a safety/nutritionist/allergen supervisor for my restaurant and staff, and this shit is out of control. If anybody has any ideas for re-educating the dipshit public about this very serious issue, I'm all ears. 




 I love my wife dearly. She is my intellectual match, she shares my interests, a wonderful mother to our children, and creative and talented and all around wonderfully perfect. 

She is also my filthy whore. 

There doesn't have to be a disconnect between the two. The things that she does to me with her mouth and her kissing our children goodnight are just expressions of love. The hand I use to fist her is the same hand I hold my daughter's in when we cross the road, and I do both out of love.

 Honestly, I would be too. That's why I'm delaying my decision. Just make sure that you guys are talking to each other about it. 




 Well, let me offer the dissenting opinion.

No matter what was talked about ahead of time, you have to respect the comfort level of your partner. If she is not comfortable with something, you can't ask her to do it out of a sense of fairness.

What needs to be talked about here, between you two, is the issue of how you're feeling. Not that she owes you, no matter what implied agreement came before. Additionally, you need to decide what you want in regards to future MFM encounters. If you like it, then do it because you and her like it, and are comfortable with it; not to accrue points that you can cash in for a FMF at a later date.

Go talk to her, tell her what you told us, and make decisions based on how the two of you feel, currently, as opposed to what's "fair".

My wife and I are exploring options in our sexual relationship, and adding a third is one of the things that we're talking about. She is comfortable with an additional male, but an additional female makes her uncomfortable, no matter what rules can be placed. One of the reasons that we have not moved ahead with this is not because of my comfort level (I'm okay with a variety of third-male scenarios), not because of a perceived one-way street of pleasure (it makes me very happy to see her receive pleasure. More can only be better). What concerns me is that she will agree to something that she is not comfortable with (FMF) for her because she perceives a lack of fairness in the situation, and tries something that she knows is wrong for her, and could jeopardize our relationship, and that is far more of an important issue than any other. 

The goal here is to keep your SO happy and safe. Go forth with that in mind. 
 
























 Delicious. Equal parts pineapple and cranberry juice, squeeze a lime wedge, splash of bar sour mix and a splash of ginger ale for some sweet to cut the sharpness of the juices. I drink two of these a day usually. 





























 It's a little weird the first time or two, but what isn't? One of the best ways to communicate sexually is to share masturbation techniques. It shows how you like yourself to be touched and loved, and the person that you care about can learn that from watching you. 

I would and have done it.

 Depends on how much of the bartenders time you took. Busy bar, and all the tender did for me is get the beer and open it? Twothree bucks is fine. Slower night, and I sit at the bar and the tender chats with me? I'll tip a couple more dollhairs for the company. 



















 My dad's dad died in WWII, but my mom's dad was around when I was a young man.

He was also a WWII vet, came home and opened a shop that sold and repaired volkswagens. Eventually, as he and grandma got older, the shop got to be too much and he sold it.

Not one to sit on his ass doing nothing, he looked for another line of work. He got hired on at our local Veterans hospital as a special ambulance driver. (He transported special cases from hospital to hospital, met organ donations at the airport, occasionally bringing a dead vet back home to their family.) 

He mainly worked in between Atlanta and St Petersburg, and over time, he started spending more and more time away. I was only twelve or so when this started but I remember conversations my mom and her mom would have about him being gone so long. They said it was part of his job...he would stay in Atlanta until they needed him to drive to St Pete and then he would be home again for awhile.

Eventually, the time away got to be more and more significant, and then he just didn't come home.

The whole family was very hushhush about it, I don't remember hearing much....until the shit hit the fan.

After much pressure from my Mom, my grandma finally called up the vets hospital in Atlanta to find out what had happened to her husband. I wasn't there for the phone call, but I like to imagine the very long pause, and then whoever she was talking to asking exactly who wanted to know. (I've heard all this second hand) When she explained that she was his wife, she was put on hold. Eventually someone else picked up the phone and started giving her hell for making a call like this, and how inappropriate it was, and how the Veterans Hospital didn't appreciate jokes.

Finally, my grandmother was told that her husband had passed away about eight months prior.

The reason they were so incensed at her calling....

My grandfathers wife worked at the Veterans Hospital as a nurse, and was well known and liked.

Yep, my grandfather had two complete families. Neither knew of the other until he passed. We (on our side) have reached out to them (on her side) and have made some connections. I'm excited to have so many new family members!

Short aside; I remember hearing a conversation between my mom and my grandma about maybe going up to Atlanta to meet the family, or at least visit the gravesite, and grandma was fairly blase about the whole thing...it really didn't seem to bother her. After my mom pressured her, she finally broke down and showed a little anger, the first time I'd ever seen real strong emotion from her.

Her anger wasn't about the second family. Or the lies. Or the time apart. Or anything that really mattered.

She was furious that his other wife was black. (We're not)

I'm sorry I can't share a funny or uplifting story about a grandpa for you, but maybe this one made you smile, and hopefully your PopPop had a long and eventful life full of great stories.

 Stop worrying about how you *should* feel and find out how you *do* feel. It was consensual, and you both knew what the expectation was going in. Did you have fun? Do you feel like anyone was cheated or lied to or misconstrued? 

I have had about equal sexual encounters; both brief and in LTR. As long as I have been honest with myself and my partner, I never felt any negativity about any situations, and I don't think that you should either. But each man has to explore his own emotions, and come to terms with what he feels. (Not with what he should feel.) 




 Thank you for sharing your story. We need more like you to stand up and point out the problem. We're at a tipping point right now, where I think we can still save the idea of community policing as a positive thing, but if we wait too long, it may be too late to ever have the communities trust the police that try to keep them safe. 














 Those were dark days indeed. 

Friends with older brothers who had access to Playboy...or the occasional Hustler. Game changer right there.

A little later in teenage years, porno vids, on VCR tapes at that, that would get passed around. 

Also, hard to believe now, but when you couldn't get access to nekkid girls, you'd wank to anything close. Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition, National Geographic, underwear ads in the JCPenny circular; back in my day you just had to make do with what you had.  









 I don't think the author was trying to shame anyone for valid safety decision making...I do try to let our kids have as much freedom as I can stand, but that's only because I have canvassed the neighborhood, I know most of the folks here, quiet roads, no open bodies of water, checked the child molester websites, tested the childrens safety knowledge, set strict limits on wandering, and remove permissions when rules are broken. The goal is to keep our children safe, but not to let our need for safety override their need for space, when said space is attainable and safe. I hope no one here is feeling shamed for making right decisions for their children. 




 No judgement here....but the article points out an interesting phenomena...our children are denied the freedom that we (most of us) had in a more dangerous world, and I agree with the author in that it may leave our children without valuable learning, memories, and experimentation. It's an op-ed piece, and it is designed to change peoples minds, not to judge decisions that they have made. 




 Yeah, I was riding my bike about 10-15 minutes or so by grade 4. 




 Go. Always.

There is this strange fascination with making sure that our kids are at school everyday...like that's the only way to learn anything. Your child won't fall behind because you guys spent three days on vacation. The experience is part of the learning process, as well. (My wife and I often argue about how much time I want to keep the kids out of school. If there is a rocket launch, or a guest speaker at the library, or an art show, or a guided nature walk....these things seem more valuable to me than organized schooling....saying all this with the assumption that your child is a good student and caught up.)

GO.  














 Be safe, OP 




 Hate that shit, man. Feels. *fistbump, buys shots.

People like that make the rest of look stupid. 




 Great question.

Short answer: Yes, completely safe, assuming the food was handled correctly before cooking.

Here's why. Potentially hazardous foods (like, raw meats, poultry, and eggs) have the potential to harbor harmful levels of microorganisms when handled incorrectly. (They're already present in our food) We can kill most, if not all, these microorganisms in our food with the application of heat, cooking it. So what happens when you get raw egg on your spatula? You use that same spatula to stir the eggs, while heat is being applied, and to flip those eggs, while heat is being applied, and to serve the eggs, while heat is still being applied, or ambient heat is still present. Anything present on that spatula has been cooked along with the product being cooked. So, completely safe, because of safe temperature management. But, consider this. You pull out your ground beef from the fridge early because it is still slightly frozen. It sits on your counter for a few hours before cooking. You use the fork to cook and serve the ground beef. You set the fork on the counter and then enjoy your yummy tacos. A few hours later, wanting a little desert, you get your flan out of the fridge, and not thinking about it, use the fork you set on the counter to eat the flan. That has the possibility of getting you sick, because of poor time management.

Not all the microorganisms get killed by cooking; instead, consider cooking food, to appropriate temperatures, a way of ensuring that there is a safe level of microorganisms in your food (i.e. at a level that your body's defenses aren't overwhelmed). While the fork sits on the counter at room temperature, microorganisms are growing. More means a higher likelihood of a negative reaction to those microorganisms.

In these examples, it's mostly just a matter of time. While cooking your eggs, you could totally just lick the raw eggs of your fingers, and be fairly confident in that not putting you in danger. Not washing your hands after touching raw eggs, and giving those microorganisms enough time to reproduce turns your hand into Typhoid Mary, infecting everything it comes in contact with. 




 I've always found GOP Women in Congress revolting! Hahahaha...

But seriously, two things here. Can't believe that we're still going on about this whole thing, and second, it's interesting that the GOP (revolting) women (seriously, have you even seen any of them? Gross) are splitting, not because of these draconian laws, but because they might lose votes? Maybe that should tell you something about the nonsense you are trying to pass.  



















 Six hours at room temp? And it wasn't frozen? Toss it. Just not safe. If it was not chicken, then maybe you could work with it, but fuck salmonellosis. 




 Hadn't seen that one. Have you seen *Frozen Lincoln Saw Her Snatch*? A very cold car falls in love with one women's vagina after peeking through her window. 









 Check out the site, people aren't posting giant stories of their lives. Just one or two lines sometimes, mentioning what they had for lunch, or asking a question about their target language. Great real world practice, though from a spanish students POV, a bit frustrating. I'll post something, be told I did a great job by someone from Mexico, and then corrected heavily by someone from Argentina, and then a user from Spain corrects him...lol. 




 Love working the two together. For more advanced learning, also check out fluentu.com, a video based learning site. Watch youtube videos in spanish while reading subtitles and then study words and phrases you've learned. Also like lang-8.com, a sort of social media platform where you post in your target language and native speakers come and correct you and engage you in conversation. In return, you correct students trying to learn your native language. 




 The only way that I find motivation to learn is to find a way to apply that learning in the real world. I've been successful at learning spanish because I have real world friends that I can practice with. I share trivia on some message boards online, and with friends over drinks. Without real world applications it does become an exercise in futility. 




 Depends on the GC type and restaurant policy.

VISA (and other) backed cards are treated like debit cards and can be tipped off of.

Restaurant cards (branded, without VISA (or other) backing) are subject to individual policy. The restaurant I work in currently, and a few others that use that magstripe type GC do not allow you to tip. It should say something on the back that might clue you in, or you could call the restaurant. 




 I'm a self learner. On top of my daily rummaging through news sites and trivia dumps, I am on my second year of Spanish on both duolingo.com and memrise.com; I am just finishing an astronomy course that I found through edx.org; and I'm excited to be starting a course on songwriting and lyrics through coursera.org

I like to learn.  














 Can't answer for everyone, but I can answer for me.

I like it. Play with it, apply pressure to it, rub it, lick it. It makes me happy. (I am a pro-prostrate hetero male, though) Going in blind, as it were, can be dangerous, as lots of dudes are real butthole sensitive, so tread with caution. 









 I'm 42, she's 36. Together over 15 years, kids, house, jobs, the whole deal. Last night was oral for her on the craft room table, twice, plus a good fisting, then a BJ for me outside on the patio, followed by PIV and then anal to finish. Nothing special for us, either, just what we had decided for that particular Monday. 

Sex is better overall for me...I understand more and I last longer. The refractory period is quite a bit longer than it was when I was seventeen...but at the same time, I've learned to take my time and please my partner, and the majority of the time a second round is overkill. (And leaves us both sore!)

 I am finally recognized as the authority on all things sexual and get to introduce various and frequent virginal young women to the joys of all the sexytime things.

I've had this fantasy for a long time, and revisit it often.

 









 Making a joke, but honestly, (manager here) we get that shit for free from AMEX and VISA/MC...approach a manager about buying one...we like the random tip every now and again too, you know. I would totally sell you one. Hell, if you were nice to me I'd probably give it to you. 




 Hungry? Go out to eat...and....you know....*wink 














 Not every day during Hellweek, but often enough. We both believe that just because the roller coaster shut down, you don't close the amusement park. 




 This is a hard thing to learn if it doesn't come naturally. I'm lucky enough to just sort of "get it"...but I've worked with people before that didn't have natural timing.

The answer is planning and practice. Plan your meals (or work from recipes) and timeline your meal. You need x amount of time for rice to cook, x amount of time to prep meat, x amount of time to bake bread, etc. Plan backwards from mealtime. Meal is at x o'clock, then rice has to be started at x-20 minutes. Cook time + prep time on your entree is 60 minutes, then start the prep at x-60 minutes. Put it on paper, and stick to it.

Then practice practice practice. I still have an occasion or two where I mess up the timing, but I have enough practice time in the kitchen that I can adapt. 




 Hard to say without actually being in the kitchen, or at least with more info. If the chicken was put in late, and not time abused at that point, then microing could bring everything into safe temp and kill any baddies floating about. But as someone mentioned above, if microorganisms are sufficiently present, cooking off an killing them solves only part of the problem, and could create more of one. The microorganisms leave behind toxins that are not temperature sensitive. 




 Interesting fact about pork and trichinosis...the reason most people still think pork has to be nearly incinerated to be considered safe. Trich (a parasitic worm larvae) was rampant in the marketplace well into the 70's. Food scientists investigating Trich discovered that it's lifecycle needed a pig to consume feces (or offal) from pigs infected already. Slop feeding of hogs was immediately outlawed for market hogs, and by the late 80's, Trich was almost completly removed from the marketplace. Newest update from USDOH/USDA have temps as low as 140f for cuts, and 135f for roasts. I personally enjoy thick center cut chops at a nice medium rare. Delicious! 




 I didn't want to get into anatoxins and food intoxification! I thought we'd keep it simple. I wonder with the resurgence of the crockpot's popularity if maybe we'd all be served well by paying a little closer attention to the safety of the food we're serving. 




 Someone else mentioned the sliding scale. It's a little different when sous-vide and hydroemersion cooking. Used as a point of reference, and even at long time, low temp cooks, the four hour benchmark applies and OP's chicken should have appeared cooked. 




 Lol. Yep. Consider this, how many times have you had a little "24 hour bug"? The squirts and a bit of a tummy ache? That was food poisoning at low levels, more than likely. Being young and assumedly healthy, your body and your friends can take it. That same dish that might make you just a little sick, or not effect you at all could cause serious problems for an elderly person or someone with a weakened immune system. 




 Absolutely correct. Assuming no time or temp abuse happened beforehand. Within reasonable consideration you can "cook out" any mistakes. Even at low temp cooks though poultry would fully cook and appear white throughout (excluding any other ingredients that could color ingredients). 




 Couple of things about the four-hour benchmark. First, it's cumulative. Any time that chicken spends in the danger zone has to be considered part of that four hour window. If you leave your chicken on the counter to thaw for an hour, you would want it to hit a safe serving temp of 165f within THREE hours...if you start considering prep time, cook time, thaw time, you can see that working with poultry, especially chicken is serious business. As for once a dish is done, most crocks have a low temp or holding temp. That will usually keep it at or near a hot enough temp to be safe for as long as the crock is holding it hot. Personally I wouldn't let my crockdish set out for longer than about an hour to cool, and I consider that as part of my four hour window. 




 Slightly safer. With chicken, you can't be too safe. Other meats are safer. It's safe to assume that any market chicken is already contaminated with some level of Salmonella.

Food, to be considered potentially hazardous has to have certain characteristics. FATTOM. Food for the microorganism, a friendly acidity level, time to pass, within the temperature danger zone, oxygen (for most microorganisms, there are some anerobic dangers, like botulism) and moisture. Marinating with a vinegary marinade can change the acidity levels, but again with chicken, probably not enough to get me to try chicken that was served medium rare or spent six hours in the danger zone. 




 Sure. Crash course food safety here.

Some foods are potentially hazardous. Meaning that given the right conditions could harbor microorganisms that they could get you very sick. 

One of the right conditions is temperature. It is safe to store food below 41 degrees f or over 140 degrees f. These temperatures inhibit the growth of potentially hazardous microorganisms.

Within that temperature range (41 to 140 degrees f) exists the optimum temperatures that encourage microorganism growth.

The other thing that food needs to encourage microorganism growth is time. The general rule is that if food spends a total four hours within the temperature danger zone, then that food is no longer safe for human consumption, and should not be eaten.

So, in the slow cooking example here, if the chicken had not reached 165 degrees f (the minimum internal temperature for chicken to be considered "done") within the 8 hour cooktime, then there was a very likely chance that the entire dish spent four hours or more within that temperature danger zone, (assuming room temperature ingredients, chilled chicken, etc) meaning that all the right conditions for microorganism growth existed.

Saying all that, there is wiggle room, and this is the most basic explanation of some advanced food safety considerations. Read up on minimum internal temperatures, time and temperature food abuse, and the temperature danger zone to learn more. 




 Temp it! If the chicken is around 165 f or so, you have cooked chicken. 

My concern here is that if you have pink chicken after 8 hours of cooking, you might not have hit the "165 f in four hours" benchmark, which could mean that your meal could be potentially hazardous. Proceed with caution. 




 It's a short one, but it's my current favorite: 

"I read once that the ancient Egyptians had fifty words for sand 

  the Eskimos had a hundred words for snow. 

I wish I had a thousand words for love, but all that comes to mind is the way you move against me while you sleep 

  there are no words for that. ~Brian Andreas

So brief, but so packed with feeling. I can hear how much he loves this woman in this short passage. Being in several relationships where I loved a woman fiercely, I get this reference...it's not easy to explain why you love someone, but "the way you move against me while you sleep" is as good as any, and that feeling, were it taken away, would leave a gaping hole behind. It just seems that Andreas was aware enough to recognize that one moment as an example of what that kind of love is, and put words to it. 




 I sorta wrestled with it for a minute, but really it's just one of those things. I don't know the difference, and it was just "normal" at that time for an American white male born in the 70's.

Our family is a fan of logic and science and reason, and thinking about things. Doing just a small amount of research showed us that there was little necessity for circumcision. That was really all it took for us. 




 I'm cut, my son isn't. Our issue was simple...we saw no evidence of medical need for circumcision, and found quite a bit of evidence supporting a "whole-man" stance.

There have been some studies that showed a decrease in some STIs,  including HIV, transmission in cut v uncut, but it was a small difference, and I equated it to cutting of your nose so you don't get the sniffles.

A friend of ours, a nurse, tried very hard to convince us otherwise for cleanliness issues. I asked her how often she cleaned her ears, and if she ever thought of removing them from her head so that she wouldn't have to be troubled by that anymore.

In short, we felt that it was archaic, and barbaric, and unnecessary, and the boy not looking like me thing hasn't really ever come up. I've done the research, I know what he needs to know about hygiene, and any possible issues that may pop up, and we've talked about them. I don't think he knows that I am cut, and at this point (he's ten) I don't see a need for him to know. I would tell him the truth if he asked, of course. 









 Good to know, thanks for the answer. 




 Great idea. I may know a couple of folks, I'm sending it on. Could something like this exist for convicted felons? 




 Huge King fan here. I see what you mean about It. I love the story, think it's great, but the dialogue was ... off. Hard to write ten year olds doing really adult stuff, and try to capture the adults responding to the stresses of the kids they were. 

Saying that, I think It stands out in that failing, along with The Talisman (another great book, but the main character is young). His early writings lack the depth of his later work, but are worth the read for the rawness of them. 

Recommendations? Try some of the short story collections. They're quicker, less depth and character development, and equally good. If you like those, expand! There's so much to like. And, because I almost have to, try the Gunslinger. Unlike his other work, but tied to almost everything that he's done before.

Personal favs: Tommyknockers - An unexpected find in the woods leads to unexpected results. A little more grown up of a story. Needful Things - A new shop opens up in a small town, and sells exactly what you want, but can you afford it? Misery - A big time writer meets small town crazy. Insomnia - An old man can't sleep, and starts seeing things that may or may not be real. The Stand - An epidemic leads to a spiritual good v evil finale. (Bit cheesy at the end, but the journey is worth it.) 




 Just recently watched "All is Lost" with Robert Redford. Kinda of an artfilm, no dialogue, just a story of a man and his boat. Worth the watch. 














 Plenty of folks already here saying encopresis, which my ten yo is dealing with. What no one is saying is that [r/encopresis](http://www.reddit.com/r/encopresis) exists. New sub for parents dealing with this issue. 














 Umm....don't want to be that guy, but... *Niggerback?* 




 The only real cure is prevention. Drink water. Get drunk, maintain drunk by alternating alcohol then water. Now that you're fucked, the only thing to do is eat something that will soak up any leftover alcohol, something heavy to give a sense of fullness, and start pounding water. Take something for  your head, but not aspirin...that can hurt your liver, and it's already on the ropes. Think when you drink, friend. Next time. 




 We made a simple mistake. My son has my name, and my daughter has my wife's name. Not Jr, just first names. It has caused problems whenever dealing with forms and such. I don't know if I regret it enough to rethink it...I'm happy with their names, but it wasn't something that we thought of ahead of time. (We all have different nicknames at home) 




 Probably not what you're looking for here, but today is my Dad's birthday, and he's been on my mind a bit today.

My dad worked hard to support our family, and I appreciate that.

But when you ask what I would thank him for, the things that come to mind are the negative stereotypes that he evinced. 

I never wanted to be a father. My dad didn't seem to want a family. It was something that he felt he had to do, and it showed. He was distant, and often angry (more on that later) and sometimes abusive, to me, my younger sister and my mom. Later in life when I became a father, the things that I always hoped my father would be guided me through the difficult transition into fatherhood. I knew that I wanted to be present, and involved, and positive, and not ham-fisted and judgemental. I've got pops to thank for that.

Pops was a Vietnam vet with a serious anger problem. Most of my memories of him are him being angry. Often for things and reasons that I didn't understand. While his experiences in Vietnam were a big reason for that unresolved anger, I learned later in life that it was something that sort of ran in my family. I experienced it firsthand as a teen and later as a twentysomething that was constantly angry. At myself, at the world, at girlfriends, at everything. There was a moment where I realized that I was becoming the things that I disliked in my father, and that was all I needed to realize I didn't want to go through life that way. After a few years of therapy and some very understanding friends, I developed some tools that have helped me deal with that fuming red dragon, and it has been a long time since I blew up at something stupid. I still get angry, I just now know how to deal with it when it happens. So, thanks Dad, for that too. 

My dad, like I said above, felt like family was an obligation. He put aside everything that he wanted in his life, because he felt he had to. As soon as my sister and I left home, he started to persue the things in life he wanted. (i.e. music performance, stage, small screen, re-enactments, that sort of thing.) He eventually spent so much time away from home and mom, that they divorced after 27 years of marriage. I learned that I should never forget to chase my dreams, and make them part of my family, less I become something that I am not. Thanks, Dad, for that too.

I recently started talking to Pops again. Small conversations, usually on Facebook. He apologized and recognized that he was a broken father, and I did my best to forgive him, and thinking about it now....maybe I've got to thank him for that too. It's never too late to try and apologize. (I don't know if it will help our relationship at all, but it was nice to hear.)

Thank your Dad for being there. For being strong. For raising you right. It's clear that you want to thank your dad for what he did; that means he did a good job, and hearing that from someone whom he loves is going to mean the world and more to him. I don't think it will matter how many words it takes to tell him that. :)

 I have a daughter. She is the most beautiful thing that I get to see everyday. I tell her everyday that she is beautiful, but I do go out of my way to reward her for being smart and kind and thoughtful and for following rules and helping her brother and a million other things. She can know she's beautiful, I don't think that's a problem, and I don't think that it will become a problem, because even though I tell her often that she is beautiful, she gets rewarded for doing things, not just for being things. But that's just like, my opinion, man. 




 Possibly. I don't know of any interview where he mentions when he is a fan, but as many know, he is a member of the [Rock Bottom Remainders](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_Bottom_Remainders), a band made up of mostly published authors. They played together from around 92 to 2012 or so, including a show at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Their set included a cover of Rockaway Beach by the Ramones. He has said in interviews about the band that they only play music that they like, and that is easy to play; the Ramones would easily fit the bill there. 




 I don't know about these individuals, but I'm going with the Tampon Bay Pluganeers....just like a tampon, they only have one string and are only good for one period. 



















 "We can't stop spying on our citizens...because ISIS"? Really? That's the best they could do? Who voted these fucks back in office?  




 I completely agree with this author. He makes an excellent point by being stupid. These facts are bad, and the author should feel bad. 














 My grandmother was a very special woman in my life. We did not get a chance to say a proper goodbye even though her death was expected. (Expected far earlier than it happened; she lived with intestinal cancer for the last ten years of her life.) I would absolutely trade a year of my life for an hour long conversation with her. A chance for her to see the man I grew to be, to meet my children and my wife. Easy choice.  




 Read the book, for sure. Then watch the most recent movie. The film does a good job dealing with....uh...some sensitive subject matter, but it can't capture the overall feel of the novel, for obvious reasons. The film lacks depth without reading the book first, but that's like just my opinion, man. 




 Thanks for this. Could use a support community. 





























 The twelve string guitar is played the same as a six string. There are six sets of two strings. The bass EADG are an octave apart; the standard string and one octave higher, the B and e are sets of the same string. Simple enough. Fun to play, big full sound. 









 Sexto in english means "sixth". 

Also, penalizar means "to penalize"...kinda sounds like penal lizard or penile lizard. I'm reaching here, I know.

Pianista...a pianist. 




 You feel like you accomplished something when you get out. Of the blonde. 




 The scientific view on aliens and gods are very different. 

We have discovered life already; here on Earth. However, we have not discovered any gods.

We have discovered that most stars have planets, and that some of those planets exist in a habitable zone around their respective stars, providing a possible place for life to exist. However, we have not discovered any proof of where gods or afterlives or punishment schemes may take place. 

We have discovered that here on our planet, life exists in almost every niche imaginable. From our upper atmosphere, to the deepest parts of the ocean, from high temps to low temps, from high o2 to low o2, etc. However, we have not found any proof that gods occupy any space other than the collective imagination of their creators. 

Personally, I don't identify as an atheist, I identify as someone who requires some proof before I believe in outlandish claims. I do not believe in any gods because there is no proof of them ever existing. I do however, believe in the **possibility** of extraterrestrial life (not "aliens" so much, but microorganisms, possibly more advanced simple life) because the exosciences continue to show that life finds a way here on earth, no matter how extreme the circumstances, that other stars have planets, and that some of those planets exist in habitable zones, that water is plentiful in the universe, and that only considers our closed minded assumption that any life we find will be carbon based and water needy.

I think, much like the explosion of discovery with exoplanets in the last decade or so, life will be found singly somewhere, probably in the fairly new future. That discovery will help us understand how and where to look for life, and we will find that while life itself may not be abundant in the universe, the possibility of life is. 




 Doesn't change your argument, but the Florida State College, before the reorganization of the Florida Education system which turned FSC into the Florida Women's College, (which later became FSU) fielded a football team from 1902 until 1905...said team was sent to Gainesville under the reorganization efforts of the Florida Dept of Ed. Yes, the Gators were born in Tallahassee. Sort of.

edit: clarification 




 Couldn't tell you the last time I bought a CD from a online retailer or in person....probably more than 10 years ago. Last CD I bought was at a show, semi-underground guy named Zach Deputy, probably about three years ago. 




 My current wife was sort of a hook up our first time. The first couple times were fun, fun enough that I came back for more. We became compatible very quickly. We dated for ten years, got married five years ago. Two kids together, still finding new ways to experiment and have fun. So, I guess the first time it didn't matter, but the sexual compatibility we discovered led to our dating, which led to our romantic relationship, which led to kids and marriage, so maybe it mattered.  














 I show up to work at about 8am. Start with coffee. If I'm lucky, somebody will bring donuts or something I can stuff in my face while I'm working in the kitchen. Around 9am I have to have honey glazed carrots roasting, and bacon cooked off for the turkey gravy and the green beans. I already roasted the turkey the night before, so I don't have to worry about that too much, but I do have to worry about making mashed potatoes and the gravy and the green beans and the stuffing, and making sure that the desserts are getting handled (this year probably 12-14 apple pies, and 10 or so pecan pies), and setting up for service, all by 11:30 or so. I'll spend lunch and dinner on the line, usually plating about 130 covers or so for the day (that's in addition to regular menu service, about another 80-100 covers), sneaking in a snack here in there...usually while checking the scores to the football games. Around 9pm, I'll start to relax...we'll feed the staff leftovers, and break out the wine (if it was a good shift). By 10, I'll be at the bar, drinking whiskey and bitching about having to work another Thanksgiving. 









 Literally just watched it traverse about two hours ago (7:37pm EST). The text alerts and the app help a bunch. Having a little knowledge about where and when to look to the sky makes it super easy. (When I first got the alerts, and saw my first (confirmed) ISS sighting, I realized I had seen it a couple of times before, and not known what it was.) 














 Had one of my servers come back and ask about a medium plus...then she asked what that meant. The whole kitchen, damn near in unison, replied "MEDIUM WELL!"

 Wouldn't that be great? But unfortunately, whenever a vacuum is created, something else is created to fill that void. (Second law of Inverse Televisionics) What ever is created to fill a recently created vacuum is also usually worse than that which was originally vacated, so the question becomes....what could possibly be worse than this? And, how many people will watch it? 
 


































 Yes. Absolutely yes. Baby powder is either talc or cornstarch. Talc gets broken down by sweat. Cornstarch babypowder is superfine, and gets everywhere, but it works better than talc baby powder.

I like to use the Vigo kitchen use cornstarch. It's not so superfine, not so messy, stays on, keeps drying all day. Just make sure to be dry before applying.

I've been using cornstarch for about six  years now. I work in an extremely hot and fast paced kitchen where I sweat and move around a lot. It's the very odd day that I have any rash or jungle rot going on anymore. 




 Shower often. 

Dry well after shower.

Apply cornstarch.
