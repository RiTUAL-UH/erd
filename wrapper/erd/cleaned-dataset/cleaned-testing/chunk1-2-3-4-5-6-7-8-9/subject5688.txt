 Conquistador. I know what one is now. 




 the perfect storm. 




 Heh, thanks. Whether this subreddit takes off or not, I just think it's more relevant now that nin has effectively disbanded and that Trent is having just as much success outside of the nineinchnails box. 




 That's why I thought a r/trentreznor subreddit would be more suitable.
 




 and if the planets aligned, he could do an AMA. 




 I think that would be great. I also think that if Trent were a redditor and he saw posts of his new work being submitted in r/nin, it would be a little bit...inappropriate. 




 But the common denominator is Reznor, and I imagine it would generate a lot more traffic than r/nin. 




 I just think that other work - for example, How To Destroy Angels - should be seen in a different light other than NIN. 









 but you get one month freeeeeeeeeeeee. 




 I read that Big Man With a Gun was a song that Trent had his only TDS regrets about, as it was a jab at American gangster rap.  If he did an AMA I'd like to know what other musical regrets he has, and if Big Man With a Gun is still one of them.

 What's the DVD called? I just thought it was part of the viral campaign Trent did for Year Zero. About a minute in I was thinking the sound is really good for somebody filming in the crowd. I nearly didn't watch all of it because I saw that there wasn't enough time in the video for The Wretched to follow The Frail. Glad I did.   









 Upvote for earballs. Though I thought I was the one who invented that word. Sooo bittersweet.

 I was so confused as to what direction Trent would take after releasing The Perfect Drug EP.  This song instantly cleared any misconceptions I had on day minus one. 




 How could i ever think it's funny how everything that swore it wouldn't change is different now. 









 I have an imaginary NIN/Trent Reznor EP made up the songs that feature primarily on movie soundtracks (eg Dead Souls, Burn, Driver Down). I always pretend to skip Deep.  




 Sorry, I somehow forgot to put the quote from the movie as he was looking at the picture. "There are dark magics here...and POWER".

 I was given the same privilege here in Australia in 2005. All I can remember is getting into a debate with the band about where to sign on a vinyl.

 I agree. Dogs don't like to put themselves where they're likely to be reprimanded by the owner.

The real 'dick' in these videos are the owners, causing the conflict with, and then laughing at their dogs trying to cope with mixed messages. 




 I'm guessing it will be to promote the VEVO Tension video. 




  "what the fuck do I say to this guy?"

I felt the same way when I met him. All I could muster up was to continue a joke conversation that Aaron North started when he was signing a record of mine. Trent didn't hear my stupid joke, but was nice enough to get me to repeat it so he could hear. I managed to get a smirk from him, so at least I've got that going for me.

 You're right. It is the worst type of post because it turned into a circlejerk of sorts. It was initially in defense of AskMyFavouriteColor's comment. Walk down the street and ask the first ten strangers you meet what a Cerberus is and you'll get a blank stare from at least 9. I can guarantee that the majority of people on this thread that recognise a Cerberus, recognise it from Harry Potter - one of the most widely read pieces of fiction of the last two decades. A smaller percentage will have already of known it from ancient mythology.  So it shouldn't be accepted that everyone should know.  I started editing because of something I remember reading on Reddit recently. That was there are some things that you can't criticize on Reddit and Harry Potter is one of them. I was merely curious and wanted to put it to the test.

 Nothing special to report, really. There is a main water pipe and sewerage system that runs the length of my street. Due to age, and because of the hill that my street runs over, these pipes have always been problematic and there is always maintenance going on. One day a few months back it was shit city. The sewerage pipe burst while they were trying to fix it and a brown river gushed down the hill for an hour. They 'fixed' it again up until yesterday when the street sharted, as per the photo. All good for now.

TL;DR - Problematic sewerage pipe.

 The night Max wore his wolf suit and made mischief of one kind and another his mother called him WILD THING! and Max said  ILL EAT YOU UP! so he was sent to bed without eating anything.

That very night in Maxs room a forest grew and grew and grew until his ceiling hung with vines and the walls became the world all around and an ocean tumbled by with a private boat for Max and he sailed off through the night and day and in and out of weeks and almost over a year to where the wild things are.

And when he came to the place where the wild things are they roared their terrible roars and gnashed their terrible teeth and rolled their terrible eyes and showed their terrible claws til Max said BE STILL! and tamed them with the magic trick or staring into all their yellow eyes without blinking once and they were frightened and called him the most wild thing of all and made king of all wild things.

And now, cried Max, let the wild rumpus start!

Now stop! Max said and sent the wild things off to bed without their supper. And Max the king of all wild things was lonely and wanted to be where someone loved him best of all.

Then all around from away across the world he smelled good things to eat so he gave up being king of where the wild things are.

But the wild things cried, Oh please dont gowell eat you upwe love you so! And Max said, No!

The wild things roared their terrible roars and gnashed their terrible teeth and rolled their terrible eyes and showed their terrible claws but Max stepped into his private boat and waved good-bye and sailed back over a year and in and out of weeks and through the day and into the night of his very own room where he found his supper waiting for him and it was still hot.

 I'm almost certain his initial reaction was to try to help. It was possibly a family member inside the diamond in which he knew was in trouble, so his body reacted before his brain could tell him not to.
