 Hannibal is my Fave for sure 




 BBC's got a huge budget to waste no matter what we think about it...

 The bigger, the better (about screens) 




 If I'm honest I haven't been there for about 2 years...I love that water part near Lancaster Gate tube station... 




 That was not your fault, mate 




 You wrote that pasage about own Paris experience so well that I became very hungry, indeed...oh, yes, fresh, crispy and heavenly smelling French baguettes...and there is so much more out there... 




 Angela needs some Barack's social Media skills and magnetism, Barack needs Angels's money maker manners... (photo was really cold one) 




 don't skip the last one...:) 




 my, my, my little kitten... 




 and now we're all 'liberal morons' if you haven't got it? 




 and I'd love to hear Dr.Richard Bandler to knock it in his own style... 




 "The worse the game is, the less the models wear"...not really... 




 That's the guy! Would love to get an apprenticeship at his... 




 "They live in the virtual world," Freakley said. He cited Facebook as a key component in targeting 18-to 24-year-olds. "You could friend your recruiter, and then he could talk to your friends." 




 "Youve heard the expression, everything is better with bacon - well, who knew that this included cupcakes." 




 How many innocent birds do they kill? 




 If I wanna fried eggs in the morning I need some power, yet I never judge the look of my power plant:)  




 what sort of gaylord lets himself be shaved by people online? 




 You could always share that 'sensitive data' with me my Scottish mate...:) 




 "Today, investment banks, the pride of Wall Street, have virtually ceased to exist. In just 12 months, they have posted losses exceeding the profits they made in the last 25 years. This example alone reflects the real situation better than any criticism." How was that possible??? + that ultra fat executive bonuses??? 




 Just too cute! 




 They shit in the woods of Atlantis 




 Just another 'corporate green PR spin'??? 




 That was hot... 




 I truly liked his preach today...will also try to follow it... 




 Exactly! There is no cool chicks without fur at least in sexy magazines... 




 That looks almost too good to be true. 




 Yes, you can! 




 Zippo always rocks... 




 not really, because I am going to multiply my orders...:) 




 She is a very adorable person, indeed! 




 pfft. We lost on purpose, we wanted shot of you 




 As always, the UK kicks the US's Ass even in children's comics! 




 my Christmas wish is that cute R2-D2 home video projector, but that credit crunch... 




 still a very good title:) 




 At least you've managed to establish quite good reference points between them... 




 I don't fancy sleeping outdoor in a tent, as well:) 




 I hope they are not too angry and too surprised:) 




 Art, yes...and very scary as well, sometimes:) 




 My congratulations, Stephanie! That was your first full marathon. Bravo! 




 I do hope that new American President will be much more green that Bush! 




 I know that, but I was brought up in a totally wrong way and I need to switch to the 'opposite side of the street', now. 




 Is fully green economy possible at all? 




 I like the quality difference between old fashioned GDP and modern GPI. 




 I loved the basic idea of not wasting my precious time for worrying about rubbish...:) 




 A short report from HighEdWeb Conference 2008. 




 I really don't know much about these amazing activities of 'Barefoot Solar Engineers', but would love to support them. I think, that we could learn so much more about practical use of renewable power sources. 




 I am still dreaming about similar dream:) 




 Solar power is the cleanest and the the best power source which powers absolutely all life forms on earth, except human activities...:) 




 I was told to wait for another 6 months in London, because the trend is 'firmly down' 




 don't tell me, it hit me very hard in london:) 




 What a cute creature! Now, I can understand Harry Potter and underworld a bit better:) 




 So cute, but so true! 




 more silly she is in real, better she looks:)

 OMG! Maybe, I'd choose the lightning strike...to die fast and in flames:) 




 I heard on national TV today that it is about $6-$8billion of cash deposits by Brits, there 




 ...or start to use a chainsaw or an axe:) 




 Of course, he could see...cold cash could buy any text in mainstream Media in advance:) 




 I watched it twice, yesterday:) 




 Apple is financially very strong global corporation with loads of cash in the bank (I don't know which bank? Hope not Lehman...:) 




 Lots of children are left alone these days to do whatever they like until they don't cause 'problems' for parents, and nobody really knows what are they really doing online. Poor kids, who don't get enough personal attention from their parents! 




 Is that one of the hot parts of that huge CERN hadron collider? 




 also my favorite choice 




 Lucky guy! 




 That has to be a very crazy, but cool festival in the Black Rock Desert of Northern Nevada! 




 And that amazingly explosive atmosphere and people who surround the skating event! One simply needs to be there to believe it! 




 These guys feel so comfortable even when in the air... 




 Competition on the market brings better products and services. Online document-hosting services are getting better, as well. 




 That Socotra Island is just surreal! 




 And all those hundreds of hours spent working with/by FF...I would think 10x times before change to anything else...  




 You are not alone, but we could hope/long about one:) 




 I love that bullet hole in/out of the forehead... 




 Some of them look so tempting, almost sexy:) 




 Nothing would stop those con experts, unless they were prosecuted by the court of justice of Republic of Iran :::)))  




 a pot of gold fish or...? 




 Were they sucking seafood to heaven? 




 I loved some of them...but, I miss 'hot shapes' of McCain and Obama...that's the latest trend:) 




 Kamikaze style... 




 That could cause a war between existing workers protected by powerful Unions:)  




 Regularly, the guy who wins is the greatest liar...but, it seems they'll have a bit of a problem this year with far too honest and str8forward Obama:) 




 That prices are just insane, even though those sweeties are insanely delicious!!! 




 Was that a delivery of a delicious political pastry mix by Democrats? 




 I could see gorgeous Paris Hilton in one of them:)...just her classy style 




 I liked the 'Scary Gremlin Monster'. 




 Wow, that's well bad, but still funny! 




 So many maps these days...it's a question, which one to choose now? 




 Which works the best for you? 




 Wow, that's quite cute and creative, man! I loved that vampire man sunbathing...and that wired pen 




 Did you have a good team to explain you all what needed and to prepare you? 




 I was scared to death in Alps, when fast summer storm started with crazy lightning and there were no good shelter:)...other things were just perfect for adrenaline junkery 




 it's very scary first time, but than you just want more and more...(of course, the supporting team of 'crazy free climbing guys' there in Slovenia was just too good)  




 I've done that many times in European Alps, but this is just truly amazing with those waterfalls! 




 Wow, I loved this link... a real Commodore 1541 floppy disk machine on the second page! (I was playing once with that and with black, old, big floppy disks) 




 android body art 




 maybe, it's coming from Tuareg - a nomad tribe in Sahara/Lybia...ot VW SUV with same name?  




 Only Extra Cold Guinness...a pint every 10 minutes...(hope it could dry the urge for a short time) 




 I know the island Wuranga on SecondLife...there's totally packed of ultra techno geeks 




 A terrific idea, though! I could even volunteer about similar implanting of a few quad Intel chips and a few new GB of RAM in my 'soft structure'...to get a few more IQ points----) 




 That's a James Bond style of artistic design...or what:)? 




 MIT and its brainiacs will invent something to cut the prices and to boost the efficiency rates as usually do, I hope 




 That wasn't really good promotion for solar powered technology...well, for old fashioned batteries to be more precise. 




 I think, that drivers there are quite good not to hit him at full speed. Hew was lucky... 




 Its batteries suck! Have you seen that...stopping in the middle of the busy highway...to be killed by a truck??? 




 a pint or two...or...of extra cold Guinness will do for me 




 Yes, it's Friday and all crowd had already departed to sunny and 'red' summer weekend

 I think, that production cost at low production scale and lack of Silicon in last year is not making huge profits for PV manufacturers. 




 They won't move a little finger without smelling a huge profit (especially not Microsoft and Google). They are not crazy to shovel their cash through the 'Windows' 




 They are just companies...they are not social services...they need to make profit or close their business 




 How red, you mean politically red or burned by too strong sun exposure? 




 I bet they have some wild underworld parties after midnight...they need to care about historical reputation, don't they? 




 It is just a shabby promotion, but I bet a successful one to grab attention. (it is so very uncomfortable to drag that loooong carriage) 




 But, it'll take some time to make it like today's Big and comfortable SUV 




 Yet, the sheer pressure from Oil corporations which are earning their record profits is much higher due to their Power Lobbying practices. They literally own political parties and all politicians. Clash of a Goliath and little ants. 




 Governments heavily subsidize coal, oil and nuclear energy sources...and they don't want changes in their money spreading schemes 




 Any big car corporation just need to really commit to the goal and we are going to get a nice and useful product quite soon 




 a cow, of course!

 The evening view from their terrace is really priceless. 




 I pretty regularly use a National Express coach A6 from Stanested to Victoria (it stops at Golders Green, Finchley Road, Baker Street before it reaches London Victoria). There is also a Stanested-Stratford rute A9 http://www.nationalexpress.com/coach/Airport/stansted.aspx It costs 10, and return costs 17. I suggest you to buy a weekly Travel Card - Oyster card at any Tube or Overground station in London for Tube/Bus/Tram/DLR/Overground train in London area/ you've even got a discount on River Thames Clippers http://www.thamesclippers.com/routes-times-prices-booking/routes-times-prices-booking.html  There is a refundable deposit of 5 per Oyster card http://www.visitlondon.com/travel/oyster/ 




 Just another 'bad' habit to embrace in London to remain safe, while using public transport (I learned it hard way some 7+ years ago between Mornington Crescent and Camden Town) 




 Sadly, their chips have become just another 'the economy of a scale' victim. 




 Aren't those slightly louder girls also being called ladettes? 




 I fully share your feelings and I need to admit that I get very emotional at this point: "upon returning from another country, looking out the aeroplane window across our neat and orderly patchwork of fields/hedgerows" 





















































































































































 I've taken a side.. as a part time photographer, I simply never upload my photos to stock sites anymore.. the copyright theft out there is insane 




 Spot on. Avoid the rush hour in London, if possible! Summers are terribly hot and humid. The price of a daily ticket is about 7+ if you buy it in the morning, and you can use it on all buses, DLR, and overground trains in the same zone. 




 and now is falling to pieces again...what a frighful experiences on Jubilee line almost every day...and they never forget to charge more and more 




 Use it badly, pls 




 they'll ignore him 




 more links like this, the better - "Louis Vuitton Whores" 




 I see what you did there, Sir 




 OMG ... "But while Manning's punishment is cruel, it is far from unusual. According to available data, there are some 25,000 inmates in long-term isolation in America's supermax prisons, and as many as 80,000 more in solitary confinement in other facilities. Where is the outrage  even among progressives  for these forgotten souls? Where, for that matter, is some acknowledgment of their existence?" 




 Thank you, Sir! (if only my teacher would have read your words some years ago) 




 ...just imagine how fast they could sort out all those tax havens if they really wanted to 




 This somehow reminds me of PM Gordon Brown and the UK gold reserves he had sold so badly... (at the worst possible moment at least) 




 Seconded...I'd love to, but...(like we're not from the same material) 




 Pretty cute, indeed

 He got trained not to make final judgements, but to present facts only (dot, dots, final picture). All the rest was a work for politicians. I profoundly admire this man, and how deeply he personally struggled to come out...finally 



















 And if you give him a chance to conduct a proper investigation into real happenings on that day, I bet he'd do it eons better   cheaper than most of current serving brass.
He somehow reminds me of William (Bill) Binney.
