 According me reddit is a legend and it can't be defeated.
still i know a website competing with reddit but its in alpha version i.e commentum.io lets see what they offer! The design is good
i can switch if they are giving better services and redditians there. 





























 And again i promise the same for this comment! :P 









 I promise you I will Upvote this post! :P 




 For me, the question should be how often I go out of Reddit. 









 So, we are trying to build an advance Wikipedia I know it is a tough task but we are not competing with the legend we are just making the legend more advance.
So, have a look guys and tell us your feedback and suggestions.

 I am a part of start-up which is making an advance kind of Wikipedia.
Have a look at the design of the UI and give me some suggestions or your feedback.

 And you are fucking asshole who don't respect someone's effort.
You are a kind of dick head who will be happy to see some fucking gifs and videos but will call an effort a spam.
But you don't have that much capability to make a thing you are shouting as spam.
FUCK YOU!
Your downvote will not matter to me.
But just learn to respect.
P.S This is not my website!
 




 what do you mean ?  









 Google is a legend I know and I am not trying to beat google.
An app can not cure cancer but it can detect if a person is suffering from it.
So, Our vision is different. 




 https://www.founch.com/demo/scarlett/profile/

We are working on this idea.

Your idea is amazing.
If you can buid that app count me in. 









 Boy: Hey babe! What's your name?
Girl: Mia Benz.
Boy: Are you lost ? my mercedes benz is searching for you

This one of the worst example i saw on internet on flirting.
