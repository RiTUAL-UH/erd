 So you would take the new shield even with the really low block rate? 




 Hey guys, so i've been playing a lightning crusader for a while and im pretty bored with it. I want to switch to fire, but i have +lightning dmg on a bunch of gear, and not many souls to reroll it to fire. So basically what im asking is, what should i look for as a fire crusader? i know i should try and get a cindercoat and maximus, but is there anything i should look for/spend most shards on? Any other advice/tips are welcome :)

 How do you think it compares to this

Although im not sure of availability in canada for that one either.  




 looks awesome, but as far as i can tell it's not available in Canada yet, but im in no rush to buy so i think i'll wait for this one to come out. Thanks a ton 
























 Laminate that looks like granite. Don't care about cost really, I'm just looking for what style/colour will go well. It's a medium size area, my entire kitchen countertop.  




 Hey guys, so I'm redoing my kitchen and need a new counter top to match my existing cabinets and floor tiles.

I'm not the best with colours and all that, so I'm looking for suggestions on what colour/style to get! Thanks!

Currently running a lightning build with about 30% CDR, not sure what to reroll into CDR or CHD.

 Hammer is my main Dmg spender, still worth rerolling to CHC? 
























 Can you build up muscle and lose weight at the same? Everywhere I see people say you have to have a surplus of calories to get significant muscle growth, but that would also make you gain weight, right?  Im trying to get rid of my gut and build up some muscle before summer, 5'10" 190. Been really confused with nutrition recently and looking for some guidance.  




 Here are some of my favourites http://imgur.com/a/gOmaM 




 I'm going to be playing pretty much all day, and I seriously want to improve my gear before the season ends so I can have a serious condemn build. I've yet to find a Blade of Prophecy, and I need a few other gear improvements. I'm looking for T6 crusaders to farm with today. My battle tag is test_subject5736#1644 




 So i went to run Dragon Age, and it acted as if it was the first time it had run, and i lost my save data and settings. I have the files in the bioware folder but i don't know how to get them to be used in the game?

Basically since i'm in Canada my options are limited so I've narrowed it down to the Canadian N550JK version (https://www.cdw.ca/shop/products/ASUS-N550JK-DB71-15.6in-Core-i7-4700HQ-Windows-8.1-64-bit-12-GB-RAM/3338923.aspx?enkwrd=asus%20n550jk-db71#TS) and the Canadian Y50 (http://shop.lenovo.com/ca/en/laptops/lenovo/y-series/y50/#customize)

If i got the ASUS id replace the HDD with a 250GB SSD and move the HDD to the optical drive. If i get the Y50, the upper model already has an SSD (only 512GB but should be enough storage). The GTX860M is about 30% better on average framerate than the GTX850M. So basically, which would you go for? i love the red look of the Y50, but it is more pricey (i would get a discount of prolly a few hundred of the ASUS). Is it worth the extra?

 The link wont update but I had changed from a lightning build to physical for GRing, And I've incorporated the changes you suggested. What stats are best on a RoRG? 




 I'm stuck around GR 37 because i keep dying too easily. What gear should I gamble on/re-roll to help me progress?

 If i am using this picture (http://rossmannellcomments.edublogs.org/files/2013/12/Planetary-Axial-Tilts-1qtzpi8.jpg[1] ) as a reference for the axial tilts of the solar system, will these numbers always be correct? Could they also be negative instead of positive depending on from where you view the planets? 
























 I'm getting a solar system tattoo soon without pluto, simply because it isn't a planet anymore. I don't feel any attachment to it, and there's nothing worse than having a scientifically inaccurate astronomy tattoo.

 How can calories for one food item vary so much? I'm trying to figure out the calories and macros for boneless skinless Chicken Breast but on MyFitnessPal the options range from 160-290 calories. How do I know which is correct, shouldn't it be the same for all chicken breasts?

 I'm getting a tattoo soon of the solar system and am including a line in each planet to indicate the direction of their axial tilt. using this picture as reference http://rossmannellcomments.edublogs.org/files/2013/12/Planetary-Axial-Tilts-1qtzpi8.jpg can i make the angles negative? so instead of Earth being 23.4 degrees away from the sun, can it be 23.4 degrees pointing towards the sun? I'm assuming yes because that is what happens during summer, but just wanted to make sure. Thanks! 
























 Yea that's one of the things I've heard, I'll have to do some research on it 




 Do you have any recommendations for beginner programs? I have been lifting since last september though, but not too seriously until a few months ago when I finished school and started the cut, and have seen some good muscle developments and have been able to increase what I'm lifting despite eating at the deficit. 









 I think this is the main reason for the difference 




 So I have two different packages of plain cashews, yet one has 310 cals per 1/3 cup and the other has 227 cals per 1/3 cup. Why is there a difference? Shouldn't it be the same since it's the same food?
