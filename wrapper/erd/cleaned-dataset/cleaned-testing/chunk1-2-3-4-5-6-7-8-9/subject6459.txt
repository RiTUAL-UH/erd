 Journalists won't take pictures because they know they will be retaliated against if they do; in this report he said they might delay airing the report for their safety. I would be surprised if he's ever let in Gaza again. 




 So HOW should they do it instead? 




 Wary. They'll turn back to anti-semitism as soon as their preachers have a change of heart. 




 If true, this would give an almost 1:1 militant to civilian ratio, which is in line with previous conflicts in the Gaza strip. The Gaza Health ministry run by Hamas say that there has been 1,900 dead, of which 80% or so are civilians. 









 He meant 96% of West Bank civilians, under areas A and B. 




 Because, legally, as soon as the charge is brought Israel can counter charge the PA with much worse. 




 To add a bit too this, the "character" of God in both Islam and Judaism are almost the same, so much so that it is universally agreed within Judaism that Muslims worship the same God. It's a debate whether Christians are polytheistic or not. 




 It's a midrash that Muhammed took and incorporated into the Qur'an. 




 To add to Lazer_Taxon, the evangelicals in America are the greatest "bloc" support of Israel -- but only because they believe it will hasten the second coming. As soon as their preachers switch back to anti-Semitism, 15% of America will go back to hating Jews again. 




 A quote without a source! Might it be pulled out of your ass? 




 It is no no longer a war crime if it is used as a military site, which is what Hamas is doing to this hospital. So Israel is going to bomb one building, not the whole thing, once all the civilians leave. 




 maddoweis.net

Nice joke, hilarious! 




 Older people saw the international Palestinian terrorism during the cold war, and educatikn teaches you is not as simple as casualty numbers. 




 To get a different perspective about the letter, read this:

I'm going to try to re-translate the letter myself and see if it comes out differently.

 Kidnap. If they're not allowing Red Cross visits or abiding by the Geneva Conventions, it's kidnapping. 




 The attack came less than 2 hours into the "ceasefire." 




 Please change "they" to "Hamas", you don't know how stupid some people are.

Edit: People upvoted my comment, I guess that works just as well. 




 Soldiers are captured if they are allowed visits by the Red Cross and the captors follow the other Geneva Conventions related to POW's. Hamas doesn't, so the soldier is kidnapped.  




 THe army went in the day that Hamas militants first attacked from one of these tunnels. Unless you think Israel controls Hamas... 




 The tunnels going into Israel cannot be used to transfer goods, they are only to attack Israel. 




 http://this-is-not-jewish.tumblr.com/post/34344324495/how-to-criticize-israel-without-being-anti-semitic 




 There are actually a lot of reports that ground troops are really frustrated that, though they are finding lots of tunnels and booby-trapped houses, they can't get the people shooting at them. 




 Wow, great rebuttal. I'm impressed. 




 Not quite yet. It will if Israel decides to go further. 




 For the 10th time, [Haaretz live blog at 7:45pm.](http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.607945) I couldn't submit it because as a live blog it was already submitted. 




 Correct me if I'm wrong

You are wrong. All of the tunnels that Israel is destroying now are ones leading into Israel to conduct terrorist attacks. The IDF only put boots on the ground in Gaza after the attack from one such tunnel. 




 ...what? Because this is true. 




 Um, no?

This is the "Convention (IV) relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War."

This specific section is "Wounded and sick IV. Discontinuance of protection of **hospitals**" [emphasis added]

If you want to prove your point, find a general article, or at least one that doesn't mention that it's specifically for hospitals

  




  Yet they didnt do it last time they had chance, nor ever before.

When was this time? They've only attacked sporadically from tunnels after it was clear that the IDF is going to destroy them so Hamas won't be able to use them in the future. 

The tunnels were stupidly not taken as a big danger by the government until now. If one attack happened from a tunnel and casualties resulted, Israel would immediately invade Gaza and destroy them. They could only be used once/in one military operation.

They dont need 10 people kidnapped, they can get the equal attention by a single guy or a couple.

No, they need as much people killed and kidnapped as possible, for popularity, money, and exchanges.
 




 Unfortunately, there will be no journalists in the area because it's an active military zone and ground fighting. No confirmation from other completely unbiased sources will have to wait. 




 If Israel is destroying everyone and everything, they're doing a horrible job at it. I'm sure that given 3000 bombs the US could level Gaza within a few hours. 




 And everything else is just a claim by Hamas. Do you actually expect journalists to report every detail about military operations from an active military zone? 




 http://www.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v1_cha_chapter4_rule14 




 So if I shoot at you many times but either miss or hit your bulletproof vest, you'll just sit there and take it? 




 Good, now you're reading! Not quite enough though. This is only regarding hospitals, **not UN shelters.** Find another article to support your claim. In addition, the only time Israel has deliberately bombed hospitals is with imminent military activity or large stores of weapons and warnings. 




 Purpose? To massacre and kidnap Israeli civilians. This achieves many of their goals at once. 




 No, the censor doesn't provide false info. Does the IDF itself? Very possibly, many militaries do. 




 It was formed specifically for Palestinians because of the creation of tons of Palestinian refugees when the ~~general assembly granted Israel the land~~ war broke out between Israel and the surrounding Arab countries, including Palestinians. There would have been no refugee problem without the war.

And really, the ones in the West Bank and Gaza (especially the latter) should not be called refugees. 

1. No other population has refugee status transferred to children.

2. Those under the control of the PA and hamas are free to move around in their territory, they don't have to stay in refugee camps. But it presents a better image to the world and continues their claim, so they stay. 




 Haaretz specifically mentions it, and I've linked to it a bunch of times here. 




 No, initially it was reporting (and still is) 70-80% civilian casualties,  "among them" women and children. Easy to be misled though, with how it's reported. Currently, [by the washington post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/world/gaza-counter/), about 1/10 are women and 1/5 are children under 18. Women make up 50% of the populace, while children make up around 50-60%

Your source is the top end, the UN is reporting 3:1 or 4:1, and the IDF is saying between 1:1 and 2:1. But for now, these high numbers will be used to bash Israel as much as possible while the reports in 3 months will be brushed under the rug. 




 I'm saying that there is one refugee organization for the Palestinians and one for everyone else. It's not racist, but it is a double standard. 




 Eh, state actors are still expected to minimize casualties if possible. 




 The journalists know the full news, even if they can't publish it. Again, they wouldn't publish something false deliberately. 




 85% is a 1:5.5 ratio, and I'm sure it will go down right after the fighting is over and Hamas announces their martyrs. It doesn't change the fact that lots of civilians are suffering though. 




 Oh, Israel has done a lot wrong. There just happens to be (or was) an Israeli peace movement, but not a Palestinian one. It sucks. 




 "Terrorism" or not, they are still a military target. And rockets are purposefully attacking civilians with the purpose of committing genocide, even if they suck at it. 




 Because logistically, it's impossible to bring stuff in and out more than once without Israel noticing. 




 Reading comprehension alert:

the presence of small arms and ammunition taken from such combatants and not yet handed to the proper service, shall not be considered to be acts harmful to the enemy.

these are neither "small arms and ammunition" nor have they been "taken from combatants."  




 Saving your comment! 




 The first rockets and war with Gaza (2006) was before the blockade took effect. Lifting it now would only cause a free flow of weapons into the strip. 




 They are currently hiding in the network of tunnels built instead of  hospitals and bomb shelters. So brave. 




 He has reported for The Jerusalem Report, the Forward, the Wall Street Journal and WRNI among others

Nice selection bias. Most Israelis serve in the IDF that doesn't mean anything.

 




 Great response :P 




 Ok, provide proof if you think otherwise. 




 So what should Israel do instead? 




 What do you mean, stupid? During a lull in the fighting when Israel is not  expecting it, possibly during a holiday, they break out of 8-10 tunnels near towns. Then they murder and kidnap as many people as possible before escaping. 




 If there is military activity in the area, it becomes a legitimate military target even if it is a declared safe zone. It then comes down to the amount of civilian casualties vs. military benefit like any other target. Doesn't make it a war crime to do so unless the civilian casualties are extremely excessive. 




 The first two were written before the full news came out, as did Haaretz. Haaretz then published an update after the full information was cleared for publishing. 




 Again, this is less than a mile from the boarder with Gaza and is constantly monitored. The only reason that they weren't discovered until now is because they are closed at the top until the militants attack. Why wouldn't they just use the Egypt ones they have? Why use thousands of tons of concrete for these and not the ones into Egypt? 




 The 8:1 ratio. 




 That's because it's an organization with helps refugees -- but only Palestinian ones. 




 Haaretz has it too, is that any better for you? It is still coming from the IDF in the end.

I think Israel has made numerous mistakes for this assault, and I'm still waiting for an explanation of the bombing/shelling of the market and school today. That doesn't mean that Israel is committing genocide or deliberately killing civilians. 




 Just think about the logistics of transferring goods into Israel, to the border which Israel is constantly watching, and then bringing those goods into the tunnels and out the other side. You really think this was ever done? 




 How many months did it take to build this tunnel while it was being used? You think the UN employees didn't know about it? 




 Cite the 8:1 source, which means only 1 out of every 9 people killed is civilian. The most I've seen (out of the Hamas run health agency!) is 4:1, and sometime 3:1. They've claimed similar numbers before, but when the dust has settled down it usually comes to around a 1:1 ratio, and I am expecting the same to happen this time. 




 I would love to be paid for this! I would be making so much money right now. :P 




 [It also has lots of credible journalists.  
](http://www.timesofisrael.com/about/)
 




 where, link? You're claiming two things in this thread and citing no proof. 




 Do you have a link to the last? Hebrew is fine. 




 Not yet. I bet Hamas' plan was to attack from all of them at once, but they didn't get the opportunity before the fighting started. 




 Read Haaretz every day and then say that no one ever criticizes the IDF. 




 The tunnels into Egypt are for smuggling, but it's not like Hamas can transfer goods into tunnels in Israeli territory. Why do you think they're building tunnels into Israel, [most of them near civilian towns](http://i0.wp.com/www.jewishpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/IDF-map-of-TerrorTunnels.jpg?fit=485%2C485)? 




 No Israeli newspaper will deliberately print false information. [The US had a censorship office during WWII as well.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Censorship) 




 Haaretz current live blog at 7:45 

http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.607945 




 Well, the post is gone now and it wouldn't allow me to comment *shrug*

Unfortunately, no international news source is publishing info like this as fast or as thoroughly as Israeli news sources are. It would be nice if CNN or other international publications produced the detailed reporting that ToI and haaretz is doing, but they don't have the audience for it.

The IDF might be wrong, but there is no source for this outside the IDF anyway, and any news organization would have to source them. That doesn't answer why you think ToI is run by the IDF. 




 Because the UN workers live in a culture where they are under threat by Hamas and it's much easier to look the other way than than speak out, especially when you came to help Palestinians anyway and your boss is doing the same. 




 This Israeli censor doesn't provide false information, only prohibits some news to be released for a time. 




 Because you can call a building empty, but if Israel tries to bomb it as a legitimate military target than civilians in the two other buildings can be hurt/killed. 




 And what about haaretz?

http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.607945 at 7:45 




 Building underground is easier than building above ground, really? I guess we're just really inefficient then, and we should all live in hobbit holes!

Plus, there is still quite a lot of empty land is gaza to build on, just look at google maps. 




 It comes from an IDF general stating what 800,000 tons of concrete could build; that is just math. Why do you think that ToI is any more "run by high ranking IDF members" than any other Israeli news site.

Edit: ~~Since you deleted your comment downthread~~ since your comment was deleted...

OP here, not a shill. I am Israeli, and started posting when I began to be disturbed by all the shit that gets posted here. I'm actually a leftist and would gladly vote for Meretz if I trusted Palestinian people/leadership, but like 95%+ of Israeli Jews I support this operation. I will need to look at what is said about the shelling of the school and market today, as well as some other things that happened;  like the "IDF bombing" of the school a few days ago which turned out to be an Islamic Jihad misfired rocket. I can't say anything about that now though, or I would contribute to the "Israel is a genocidal baby murderer" meme here. People can't seem to understand that it is neither in Israel's strategic interest, not do they want to, kill civilians. 
























 I hears reports of at least 13 Hamas members captured or surrendering. Is this possibly one of the goals of the ground invasion, maybe for intelligence purposes, or just a fluke? I don't remember any reports of captures members in 2006 or 2008. 







































 I've been fasting since early this morning; no food and no water. Since starvation mode is activated when you eat too little, I'm wondering exactly when it starts? I would really like some free energy right now. Anyone have tips to make it begin? I'm starting to feel weak...

Edit: oy, Poe's law. In case people didn't get it, this is satire. I am really fasting though. Thankfully it ends soon after sundown. 




 A UN agency recently announced that around 75% the Palestinian casualties in Gaza. Is this correct, or is it just the UN again? If it is true, why is it higher than the 1:1 ratio in the previous two Gaza operations? 









 Jesus very obviously did not fulfill the important messianic prophecies which people associate with the Messianic age. [\(A small list.\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/wiki/jesus) The usual counterargument is that Jesus will return and and fulfill all of them in the second coming. But if I don't believe in Jesus in the first place, why should I assume this? The Messiah will be the person who brings in the Messianic age -- if he dies before doing so, then he cannot be the Messiah ([see Bak Kokhva an example](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_Kokhba_revolt)).

So can you prove from the Tanach (Old Testament) that the Messiah will either die before fulfilling the prophecies or come back to Earth after dying? I reject the validity of the New Testament, so unless you want to try to prove that first, it won't be very productive to argue from there.

 




 I know this thread has probably been posted many times in the past, but I have two specific questions I don't have answers to.

1. Why do Muslims think that the text of the Tanach (the Torah, Prophets, and Writings) was corrupted? I know that there is a su'rah (is that the right term?) claiming such, it would be nice if someone could quote it. But I would also like to know how parts are determined to be corrupted and how it happened. Is it just assumed to be the stuff that contradicts the Qu'ran? [I had a small discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/29de5y/islamic_view_on_jews/cik3of9) with /u/possiblea2m about it, but he couldn't follow up on the final answer he gave me, so I clarification on that would be nice as well.

2. Do all Muslims believe that the current Jews are not related to B'nai Yisrael? I was told a such by /u/Redhawk1000 [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/29de5y/islamic_view_on_jews/cijzcnq), but he didn't finish answering my questions. If yes, why? When did the split/loss occur? If no, why is are the quotes wrong? (I have very limited background in Arabic, so please provide translation if you can. Interlinear/transliteration is even better.)

Oh and one minor question I recently thought of. Do the Qu'ran record any prophets in the line of Ishmael (edit: besides Muhammed)? I haven't seen any referenced, but that doesn't mean there aren't.

Thanks in advance for answering! Feel free to ask me any questions about Judaism as well. 

   /May you find peace. 




 My computer is a Dell Inspiron 1440, running windows 7. My computer was slowing down after longer periods of use (over an hour), especially while playing games. I asked here on the live chat what I could do to improve performance and was given various good suggestions. Now, I consider myself somewhat knowledgeable about software if not hardware (I know, I know, I lot of people say this, but I have a little experience programming), so my computer was already clean of malware and I had been disabling unneeded programs running in the background. After trying some of the minor suggestions, I decided to clean the fan when I downloaded Coretemp and realized my computer could run up to 190 degrees F even when only using internet and video chat when in a 70 degree room. After seeing this, I decided to clean the out the fan and make sure nothing was wrong with parts of the computer.

I watched a video on how to disassemble the parts, and it was a great learning experience! Unfortunately, in order to access the fan, I had to take out the motherboard as well instead of just the keyboard and outer case. The fan was indeed dusty, though not quite as bad as other pictures I looked at online. I cleaned the fan using a small vacuum and cloth, cleaned the motherboard of dust with compressed air, and wiped down the non-electrical parts of the computer. I made sure I was very careful, remembered where all the parts and wires connected, and kept track of all the screws and various other parts while taking the laptop apart and putting it back together. The only part I know I might have made a mistake on is the order of the two large chips in the bottom of the computer (Maybe the RAM? I don't know what they're called...taken out at 1:05 on this video:  www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulecDVBnDwc. Would switching them actually change anything?)

Now my computer turns on, but the screen stays off and after about a minute it starts beeping 4 times in a row every 5 seconds. What could I have done wrong, and what are my options now? I did a full backup right before disassembling, so worst come to worst I guess I'll have bring it to a repair shop and they could fix it and wipe it. Any advice for me, r/techsupport?  




 A common argument I've seen for the validity of Jesus as the Messiah is that he was unique in certain respects. Usually, the twin claims are that he committed no sin and that he performed many miracles, including raising himself from the dead. Putting aside the former claim, (because of the unverifiable nature and that there is no reason for a Messiah to be sinless), why do the miracles make Jesus unique. The Bible clearly states in Deuteronomy 18 to be vigilant against false prophets who will turn people away from the proper worship of God. These prophets will "perform signs and wonders" to prove themselves, and God tells the people not to trust just because they perform miracles.

So why are Jesus' wonders used so often as proof of his status as the Messiah/divine? And are there any other reasons to believe that Jesus was a unique human?

We can also discuss the sinless claim if someone brings a verse to show the Messiah must fulfill that requirement. Please don't bring into the argument that he was God as well, because not only is that impossible to argue about, it doesn't answer my question. 














 Can anyone explain to me what exactly is the reason that minhag is taken so seriously in the orthodox world? I've heard people talk about minhag like they do about kashrut. Some really weird practices are justified as minhag, sometimes so much so that people refuse to change them. Why is it taken so seriously both culturally and halachically? 

I went to Orthodox day school, so feel free to give me sources. 









 Is there any knowledge of specifically how parasites control the behavior of their hosts? What parts of the brain do they affect? Do they block or add neurotransmitters? Does the method change among species? For example, I know some wasps use venom, but fungi or bacteria probably use different means. Links or books to read further on this topic are also greatly appreciated. Thanks! 




 I recently bought Awakening, and absolutely loved it. I owned Path of Radiance and played it when I was younger multiple times. Then I bought Radiant Dawn some years ago and played once, and now I'm playing it again when I rediscovered FE with Awakening. Once I'm done with RD, what game(s) in the series should I play next, and how can I get it? I have a 3DS, a DS, and a Wii, and a computer (:P). Thanks! 




 I was a really big Pokemon fan when I was younger. I played the first and second generations to death, starting multiple games over again so I could experience the thrill of training my pokemon from scratch and beating all the gyms for the first time. I then tried my hand at emerald for a it after it came out, but for some reason I couldn't really enjoy it and stopped after a while. I did the same for Pokemon black, and even almost made it up to the Elite Four, but I didn't understand a lot of the new pokemon, moves, or any of the background stuff. 

I just got a 3DS and a copy of Pokemon X for my birthday, and I want to play and understand, and enjoy it! I'm really excited about the new generation since it seems really immersive. I'm not really interested in the competitive scene nor spending hundreds of hours breeding the best pokemon, but I do want to know how to better train the ones I catch! 

So what's new? What are EV's, how do battles with multiple pokemon flow, did B-down to catch a pokemon ever actually work (I'm still going to use it anyways!), etc. Educate me, please! 
























 The half blood prince, fantastic? I hope you're being sarcastic...

or some reason they decided to jump on that and focus more on the relationship drama and less on the actual storyline.

whelp, that might be why. The relationship drama is the storyline, even in the book. 




 This probably wouldn't be in the shulchan aruch, but is there any discussion on what a mourner who goes to two different shacharit services on the same day should do? That is the closest to this situation.

 




 You can say that as many times as you want. I have it open and don't see that. I'm in siman 55. Can you point to where it says that saying kaddish with less than 10 is assur, or where saying a d'var sh'bikdusha with less than 10 is assur?  




 You are saying it is assur, but I'm looking at the mishnah brura and it doesn't mention assur anywhere. Is it preferable to say it with a minyan? Yes. Must a minyan say it? Yes. But nowhere does it say it is assur if there is not a minyan. Again, it's great you're studying it, but I haven't, so if you could please cite your sources it would be very helpful. 

This doesn't even get into the difference of saying it to yourself versus a public declaration among less than ten. 




 Alright, I see  , but no assur. I also see no discussion on what a single person can or should do. I also see that a Katan does suffice for the tenth, unlike kedusah, meaning this is on a lower level. (Actually, I think I might have misinterpreted this--it's unclear whether these are laws for just kaddish or also brachu, kedusha, etc.) From my limited knowledge is seems totally fine to say the words of the kaddish by yourself, but it does not yotzei you.

Maybe the Aruch Hashulchan discusses it, but I can't look right now. 




 Don't worry about it. We're having an argument on the fine points of a specific law.

A minyan is ten Jewish men by Orthodox standards, ten Jewish men and women according to more liberal movements. Those of us who are more liberal/egalitarian also say there is no difference between men and women in this.

Edit: Just because the most stringently observant on here say certain things doesn't mean they are always true for everyone. :P 




 One second, the kaddish doesn't even have Hashem's name. What is the difficulty? 




 thanks. Unfortunately I only have the Mishna Brura and Rambam here.

Edit: Oh, you are referring to the mishna brura! stupid latin letters... 




 Is there a source? Also, remember the principle of teaching when saying God's name. 




 Some synagogues do sell them. If they don't, they can definitely refer you to someone else who does. 




 That's very appropriate. :) 




 It's not a mitzvah to do it, but I do not believe it is forbidden.
 




 Hmm, I thought you said Lamarckism, and Lyskenkoism seemed to be a political structure that used it as a basis. So to be clear, I'm talking about the heritability of acquired characteristics.

I'm also a layman, so I can't say very much; I'll explain it simply with more technical words in parenthesis, since I don't know your knowledge level. The basics of it that I know is that experiences (stimuli) over the course of an organism's life can change whether genes are turned on or off (expressed). Since genes are usually just codes for a cell to make proteins, expression simply means whether or not the specific proteins are made.  This is mostly caused by the way the genome is folded/held together. 

For example (and this might be relevant for people here), the gene for lactose tolerance in adults can frequently stop being expressed (i.e. the protein it codes for stops being make) if you stop drinking milk. So an adult with lactose tolerance who does not drink milk for a few months would find it difficult to start again because there are no more proteins to break it down.

The theory is that the expression of genes, in addition to the genes themselves, can also be passed down by parents. How exactly it works I'm not clear about. It's not Lamarckism in its original and expansive form, but it does share similarities. 




 Well, an altered version of it has been making a comeback recently. 




 You can also say the Mourner's Kaddish if you want -- it's a prayer in Aramaic, but most prayer books have it transliterated. You might or might not find it meaningful.  

Edit: [Here's a link](http://www.jewfaq.org/prayer/kaddish.htm) to the Hebrew, English, and transliteration. [Here is wikipedia's explanation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaddish#Mourner.27s_Kaddish).

Edit: Also forgot, is there any site or sub were I can learn more about my heritage?

That's what this sub is for! Read the wiki and people would be happy to answer your questions. I also recommend jewfaq.org

 Look up the 48, 67, and 73 wars. A ceasefire was only put into place once Israel started winning. 




 There are two different interpretations. 

'We must never again allow a genocide to happen."

Vs.

"We will never again be like sheep led to slaughter." 




 And I'm saying that this "he" refers to all of mankind. My support is that seed is always plural, and that both Adam and Eve are referred to as you when it refers to all their descendents.  




 It doesn't say anywhere that the "suffering servant" would be pierced, nor that the suffering would "bring" salvation. 




 Other biblical texts clearly identify the snake with Satan (i.e., Revelation)

Fan fiction, doesn't count.

The text specifically says that your head shall be crushed -- not a generic snake, not the snake's descendant, but that particular snake.

It also says you to Adam and Eve, and that clearly refers to them and their descendendants. Why is this different?

There seems to be a particular descendant referred to by the "seed" -- it's a singular "he" who will do the crushing, etc.

"seed" always means "descendents" in the Bible. Is there a time it is not plural that you can point out? 




 Oooo, oooo, I know this one! Hocus, pocus, [balobocopypaste](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/29dzp2/why_is_jesus_always_depicted_as_being_white/cikvnv9)!

Isaiah 53 is very clearly talking about the Children of Israel, though it is obscured by the way Christians separated the chapters. If you look at 52: 13-15 (which is the same section that starts with chapter 50), you can see that the prophet introduces a "servant" in third person. 13 says that the servant will be exalted, 14 that (in past tense) "marred beyond man is his appearance," 15 that (in future tense) how kings and nations will react.

Then, in 53:1, the narrative shifts to the perspective of those kings and nations, who are talking about the servant after he has risen and exalted. In the past, "he had not form," "he was despised," etc. But now "He has grown," "he might see offspring," etc. Then in the second half of verse 11 the narrative shift back to prophet, who describes the servant a bit more.

Now how is it possible that, during the time the prophet was speaking, Jesus was already marred, and that nations were appalled (did this ever happen?). Only in the future will the nations say "As one who hid his face from us, he was despised, we held him to no account." Did they ever say this about Jesus? If you read the entire section, chapter 53 is actually the pivot between a mourning Israel/Jerusalem and a joyous one, it makes sense why Israel would be referred as a "suffering servant" here. 




 Vanilla morrowind was good for its time, but modded morrowind is amazing. This is from someone who only started playing a few months ago. 




 Has Hamas not essentially declared war on Israel? Or did they provoke Israel into declaring war on them?

Hamas' declaration of war with Israel is in its founding document. This recent violence between Israel and Hamas began with Hamas firing rockets, yes.

Either way... if one side continually declines a ceasefire, how can the other be held accountable for any casualties of war? Surely Israel would prefer to not catch any civilians in the cross fire, but if their opposition chooses to fight shoulder-to-shoulder with civilians, then what option do they have?

Good question, ask all the Hamas supporters around here.

That said, I'm disappointed in Israel's strategy; why not attempt to use Hamas' tactics against them? Spread the word that Hamas leaders/militants only intend to use your (civilians) lives as sand bags and blast shields. Consistently and constantly plea with civilians to flee. Offer salvation and safety on the border, risk Israeli lives to save those that are disenfranchised by the Hamas - let the world see Hamas firing on their own fleeing peoples... on IDF trying to help civilians leave.

They've done all of this, doesn't change a bit.

On another note, why not attempt to gas such a densely populated area, where there is no realistic escape for your enemy, with a sedative? Get in, grab civilians, capture Hamas militants. Rinse and repeat as needed. Can't we do something besides lobbing bombs at one another? Not much of a farcry from trebuchet times - where the Homo Sapien species barely understood... anything.

New headline when a 90 year old tragically dies: "Israel is gassing Gaza!"

What is Israel doing to ensure civilian's safety, aside from giving them notice that they're about to drop bombs all over their neighborhood? Is it so much to ask that the IDF stick their necks out? What if Gaza was packed with Israelis instead?

A house is typically only bombed after a call and warning "knock." The IDF *does* stick its neck out -- it doesn't have to send soldiers into Gaza, it could get everything done by air, but with severe civilian casualties. Then you would see an actual 80-90% civilian casualty rate. 




 No, no, israelnationalnews is the best website ever!!  




 The Zionists were a terrorist group to the world.

Citation needed. Zionist leaders welcomed in the US say otherwise.

The Zionists believe in one state for Israel and control of the entire holy land.

Citation needed.

After the British left the Zionists turned their focus on controlling the holy land.

No, there didn't happen to be a civil war right before they left and armies invading afterward.

They gained control by forcing native Israelites out of the land if they weren't Jewish.

Yes, yes, that's why Israel has always had a 20% Arab population, right?

The people forced out still felt a right to the land since they were on it since the ancient Hebrews.

Arabs have only been there since the 7th century; they're proud of that conquest too.

Six Day War occurred and people ignored that the new Israel state has grown past the partitioned lines it was. given.

"Occured" is such a lovely word, isn't it? Allows you to ignore why Israel conquered those territories.

The people in Gaza form Hamas in order to get the land they felt was theirs.

This ignores all history between 1967 and 2005, lucky you. 




 The battles 60+ years ago were to kick all the Jews out. Hamas is still fighting for that. 




  The grievance being that the Zionists when taking over Israel forced the native Jews and Arabs to assimilate or out of the state into Gaza and the West Bank and thus created the tensions that aren't being absolved today.

This is so incredibly simplistic to the point of being wrong, I don't even know what to say. 

I think that just because Hamas is bad doesn't make the grievance any less important.

Their grievance is that there are Jews in the area at all. If you agree with that, you are condoning them. 




 So are they fighting today's battles or the ones from 60 years ago? 




 Ah, so you agree with them? 




 You do realize that there was no siege until the rocket fire started? And that it will end once the strip is demilitarized?  




 They call all of Israel "occupied." Get your head out of your ass and realize they want to ethnically cleanse the area of all Jews.

 Probably less so than ynet and jpost, which are posted here all the time. 




 And when people ask why everyone can't just stop shooting and live together peacefully, this is the answer. 




 They didn't publish that any more than reddit publishes self posts. The guy signed up for a blog before, and spewed some racist shit on it which the editors removed and then banned him.
 




 It wasn't even an op ed, just a random blogger who they host. 




 How about the fact that they didn't publish anything anymore than reddit does? The guy signed up for a blog before, and spewed some racist shit on it which the editors removed. 




 jewfaq.org is good for reviewing things you might have forgotten, but it doesn't go in depth. 




 As long as there is a giant explosion and darkness when it hits the ground. 




 No idea. Maybe the yeshivish people here can explain it? 




 So your argument is that the method of execution (stoning) is immoral? Again, define your argument. 

Your example is like saying you forced someone into an electric chair and electrocuted them, and by the laws of Oklahoma that is ok. :P That's murder, not execution.

That's a moral execution, which isn't murder, and the bible didn't say to put the person on trial, but to just do it, so no laws broken.

Notice the example given has a trial first. The bible does say there and elsewhere that there has to be a trial before an execution.

Job is clearly an allegory, and one way of saying that we cannot necessarily find a reason for suffering. 

How much longer until you agree that stoning is a torturous way of ending the life of another person,

I disagree.

and that it wouldn't be ok for anyone to order it be done.

I agree! 
 




 Oh, not a full takeover, but a limited one just near the border. The "I keep bombing you as long as you shoot rockets" and "I will keep the blockade until you get rid of the rockets" are pretty strong cards in my opinion. 




 Nope, it was the air force, not the navy.  




 No it isn't - you don't get a free pass to kill as many human shields as you like. Proportionality still supplies. You can't kill a hundred civilians to destroy one rocket being hidden in the same building, for example.

True. Most people mistake a war's proportionality for a strike's proportionality though. I have yet to hear of one airstrike killing one hundred civilians.

Isn't that just a tu quoque?

No, since this is said to people calling for Israel to stop bombing. Why should Israel be held to a standard that no other western country is? 




 You try doing so from an airplane or drone 1000 feet up in 15 seconds using heat imaging. 




 I'm not, I'm letting you define the scenario. Who are you aiming at? 




 Right so what we should stick to Palestinian endgame of forcing all the colonists to go elsewhere and the rest of the Jews to live as second class citizens, seems fair.
 




 And if you shot at someone you would be arrested. 




 What about all the Arab states that kicked the Jews out? Should they be forced to take them back too? 




 Then yes, you are using the family who lives in that house as a willing or unwilling human shield. And who are you firing at? Soldiers of a dictator are very different than civilians of an enemy state.
 




 Israel said that it targeted a militant site, and it was thought that the kids were Hamas fighters running from the shelling.  




 Israel won't accept it though. Since Israel withdrew voluntarily and is ready to return to Gaza if need be, Israel holds most of the cards. 




 What was the other peace process in which Bill Clinton intervened?

Oh, [right](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo_Accords), that [one](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_David_Accords). 




 The boys on the beach was a mistake, and Israel admits that. Unless it was fired knowing that they were all children, then it's not a war crime. War is brutal, and maybe Hamas shouldn't have started this one.

And none of those three schools were actually targeted. 
 




 Maybe just maybe there were actually many rockets fired from Gaza. 




 120 years' worth 




 Responsible for the action, yes. Responsible for the result? It depends. And certainly the person putting the civilians in harm's way can't be the one doing the complaining. 




 The rule 97 that I quoted from. And what is your point? Proportionality does not relate to overall casualty figures, and I would like you to prove that israel is not taking precautions in attacking. 




 You're just avoiding the question. What should Israel do in that scenario?  




 You can't blame the opposing force for killing the civilians you're hiding behind. 




 Yes, but you would usually not keep a crowd of civilians behind you while you are attacking, for two reasons.

1. You care about your people.

2. The tactic only works when the other side also cares about not killing them.

I'm not disputing hit and run tactics, but doing them next to civilians, whether they are willing or not.. 




 Um, yes it is? It might not be permanent, but it is being used for military purposes. 




 I'm pro-Israel and I mostly agree! I would like to comment on a few things though:

With that said, they have at times acted carelessly and overly aggresively. Their response of "Hamas is worse" does not suffice, because a legitiamte state should hold itself to a higher standard than an extremist group.

The response is not "Hamas is worse" but "since Hamas is using human shields, we are not at blame when those civilians die," which is true, legally, under the Geneva Conventions. You might argue about the morality, but it is not a war crime 

Also, Israel is usually saying "but America/the EU does the same/worse with lesser threats" which I have yet to see a coherent argument against.

The non-Hamas Palestinians and their more moderate leaders such as Fatah/PA are caught in the middle and the ones who deserve our sympathy

Eh, the thing is that Fatah is utterly corrupt and is just out to line their own pockets. The civilian population which does not take part in hostilities or riots is in a much worse position. 




 Then don't blame the opposing force of a massacre and genocide when your civilians die along with the freedom fighters. Usually a resistance is trying to minimize their own civilian casualties, not make more die.
 




 Then don't blame the opposing force of a massacre and genocide when your civilians die along with the freedom fighters.
 




 Yes, it is.

It can be concluded that the use of human shields requires an intentional co-location of military objectives and civilians or persons hors de combat with the specific intent of trying to prevent the targeting of those military objectives.

http://www.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v1_cha_chapter32_rule97 




 Then don't blame the opposing force of a massacre and genocide when your civilians die along with the freedom fighters. 




 Ok, Israel lifts the blockade on Gaza and two months later there are 20 rockets every day, and several suicide bombers have gone off in towns neighboring Gaza. Now what? 




 What's your point? 




 And all the reports of them doing otherwise this time are hogwash? And that still doesn't address the fact that setting a military installation near civilians is also using human shields. 




 That is what they are doing, as per this article. My personal opinions are beside the point, I would just like to know if he would be using human shields like Hamas does. 




 If you were in Gaza now, would you hide behind ~~a mound~~ an apartment building, pick up a ~~gun~~ rocket launcher and take pot shots at Israeli ~~soldiers~~ civilians?

FTFY. 




 1. They're in danger as long as they're in Gaza, not because the firing has stopped. 

2. Other journalists are still in danger if they are caught doing similar things.

3. Hamas might take action against the news company still in Gaza or in later reporting, even if that specific journalist doesn't return. 




 Nope.

 [Look at how many bases are not embedded in cities among civilians!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Israel_Defense_Forces_bases) 




 What would a proportionate response be, then? 




 No one sane in international politics thought it was a false flag operation; the two suspects were known members of Hamas and went missing since the day of the kidnapping. A week or so into the search, Israeli intelligence said that the suspects probably acted at their own initiative without a direct order, but that Hamas leadership did encourage their operatives to carry out more kidnappings.

Did Netanyahu use it as an excuse it to round up Hamas members in the West Bank? Absolutely, but that doesn't make it a false flag.

Hamas, if it knew that one of its leaders in the west bank was arrested, might have refused the ceasefire that Israel wanted now that the tunnels are destroyed. Israel revealed it today, after 12 hours or so of the ceasefire being in effect, because they did not think Hamas would take action now that the whole world would blame them for further escalation.  




 Israel bombing a rocket launcher near a home makes the fact that civilians died, though tragic, not a war crime unless casualties are disproportionate to the military gain 

edit: for the specific military strike, not the whole operation/war. 




 [The reaction to Israel using soldiers instead of airstrikes.](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2b8bd7/at_least_100_palestinians_from_a_single/) 




 A 1:1 civilian to militant casualty rate is the best in modern warfare. 




 By this logic, you are encouraging Hamas to continue these tactics since they know Israel won't fire back. In this case, what should Israel do instead? Because no population will allow its government to sit and do nothing while rockets are being shot at it. 




 Ok, that's step 3. There are three different levels here:

1. When is killing justified? Answer: War, self-defence, and execution.

2. What are valid reasons for executions?

3. What are valid methods for executions?

You have to agree to the first before we go to the other two. 

This is debate is about specifically the commandment from god to not kill, and the commandment from god to kill.

And my original comment was saying that **there is no commandment from God to not kill.** the verse says do not murder. You can argue about whether it is humane or capricious, but it is not a contradiction. Saying so only hurts your argument. 




 And this is why the Israeli censor is sometimes important. If this had come out three weeks ago instead of after the ceasefire, Hamas might have taken more drastic action. 




 They're still in danger, unfortunately. 














 You're arguing that killing during war, self-defense, and execution is morally acceptable, because god ordered it.

No, I'm arguing that these are the acceptable situations in which killing is permissible the world over and always have been. The argument over whether these laws should carry the death penalty (and why) is the second argument, but the other one has to come first. So do you accept the death penalty and other forms of killing are permissible (if not ideal), at least for this argument? 




 [But it is in line with the reporting of past conflicts.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_War_\(2008%E2%80%9309\)#Casualties) 




 No, it just means that Israel is better at protecting it's civilians. I would not want to see the number killed with no sirens, bomb shelters, or Iron Dome. 




 Are we arguing the death penalty now? Because that is a different subject entirely. We can do so if you want, but it's not the same argument as you had above. 




 It is an execution if the person is brought before a court of law and tried according to [procedures outlined here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_and_corporal_punishment_in_Judaism). Otherwise, it is murder. That's why the story of Jesus stopping a stoning is so nonsensical.  




 Ground invasions actually have worse civilian casualty rates than air strikes do, since artillery shelling shelling is much less accurate. What if that strike team was surrounded? Shells would fall on that entire neighborhood, killing dozens. Would you condemn Israel for that too?

And that justification is much, much better than the the justification for Hiroshima and Nagasaki: We won't be able to conquer Japan because there would be no support for mass troop deaths, so lets bomb the fucking civilians and kill thousands instead of attacking soldiers.  




 Ratzach = Murder

Harrag = kill

Executions, war, and self-defense are killing, not murder. It's the same thing today. 




 I don't care about the points, but about the post being visible. I don't complain if it's above 0. 




 Journalism before video was a thing, you know. There are still these thing called "written articles" which /r/worldnews sometimes links to. Amazing, right? 




 God never says not to kill, but not to murder. If you're going to argue this, do it correctly. 




 And this is how polytheism started! :P 




 Innocent civilians will be killed and the world will be up in arms not matter what, so let's not risk soldiers if we don't have to. 




 Allow them to take it and report on it once you leave.  




 No, the bible is infallible because words are used consistently. In this example, "face to face" is always an idiom for "directly," while "see My face" is compared to "see My back." I don't need to deal with the NT. 




 Yes, the work they do is dangerous, but they should say that Hamas is intimidating them. 




 Then they should say so instead of meekly parroting Hamas' talking points. 




 So they dutifully parrot Hamas' talking points instead. Not doing so isn't Pulitzer worthy, in normal circumstances. 

If they're scared, they should say so instead of covering it up. 




 It really shouldn't be. They were just at the right place at the right time. There should be many more of these types of reports coming out of Gaza.

Edit: really guys, downvotes? I'm not saying they need to have the balls to film it while their in Gaza, but they should at least report on it once they leave. If they are staying silent outside of Gaza for "access," then they are acquiescing to this war crime.

 I'm not in DebateReligion, so I'll make this quick. "Three persons, on God" is polytheism *according to Judaism*. The range of permissibility is from "complete idolatry" to "acceptable for non-Jews."

 The same reason that as an American (or a citizen of any country), you have rights and responsibilities that others, immigrants or tourists, do not have. If David's mother is American and he is born in another country, he gets citizenship as soon as he visits the nearest consulate. You are Jewish the same way, it's just more automatic and cannot be revoked.   




 Everyone has to go through a period of atonement/spiritual cleansing. Non-practicing Jews just might have a little bit more to go through. 




  What is the purpose of saying he must technically keep the commandment if his actual obligation is waved?

How it is treated in Jewish law. Suffice to say that until he learns about it, it doesn't matter.

Humans are humans and if you WANT to be in this covenant, that's one thing. But, from my POV, it's completely unfair and unjust that my friend Daniel is given expectations because of his blood.

His blood and mine are NOT significantly different. Of course there is a difference, but the difference is not significant. Making it significant is a fabrication. A method of keeping clan-unity in the ancient world. We should, as species, move past this obsession with blood-line. It's unhealthy. It's unfair. It's unreasonable.

This is ancestry, not "blood." The blood is pretty much the same all around. 

It comes down to a different system of values. Post-Enlightenment western values places a lot of emphasis on individuality, while traditional Judaism has more of a balance between community responsibility and individual desires. As an atheist, I assume you support the idea of moral relativism, of which this is a manifestation. 




 All I'm saying is it's ignorant to think that we can say with absolute certainty that the Big Bang is fact, same with evolution.

That is the Orthodox definition, yes.

Why would I follow this rule if I believe that not worshiping an idol would be bad for me? Also wouldn't Trinitarian and Latter Day Saint Christianity count as idolatry?

It is forbidden for Jews to practice it, but it is probably allowed for everyone else.

Would saying "I think the god of the Tanakh, New Testament, Qur'an and Book of Mormon is not worthy of worship" count?

Debatable, but probably not.

I don't eat anything with meat as the primary indigent but I do eat stuff with meat as a secondary indigent. I don't think eating an animal while alive will be a big deal to me. Also it is unsanitary.

Eating meat, in general is allowed. But with the cruel conditions many animals are raised today, there are actually arguments to say that this is being violated. Also things like shark fins which were torn from the animal before it dies.

What does this exactly mean? And what law?

A system of justice that society chooses for itself. 




 There is no eternal hell in Judaism, and no one is cast into "damnation."  




 Calm down. The situation you're describing is, in Jewish law, equivalent to someone who is taken captive. He is still technically has the obligation to keep the commandments, but he is not liable for any of them since he doesn't know about it. 

I'm sorry, but BONDAGE that is inherited by children and their children and their children is UNFAIR. My friend Daniel is a free agent and he decides who or what he forms a pact with.

This is a different discussion entirely. 




 And the residents of the south will continue to suffer in the meantime. It's time to end this now -- it's the best chance that we're going to get. 




 But giving in to demands without anything in return is even worse, since it further legitimizes Hamas among the Gazan population. 




 A forced cessation of hostility because they ran out of rockets is much better in the long run. This ceasefire only allows them to restock...again. 




 A ceasefire? Now? I would have been a favor of one 10 days ago. But now Hamas has few rockets left, the majority of people near Gaza have already left, and the international community's attention has turned away. Now is the time to continue until they run out of rockets and force them to demilitarize, not to **reward** Hamas for shooting rockets.

  Micah 5:2 But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times. 700 B.C.

This is not a prophecy that the Messiah will be born in Bethlehem, but will come from the clan of Ephrat near Bethlehem - i.e. the line of King David.  




  Matthew did not "make up" whatever ancient writing he was referencing to say this.

Matthew either made it up or referenced something of which we have absolutely no record today. Considering that the Jewish canon, including the prophets, was already codified at the time, I think the former is more likely.

 To add to your analysis, Israeli news is reporting that Hamas has around 25% of its rockets left, but only a few of which can reach beyond the area right near Gaza. 




 His dissent is pretty much in line with every major news source out there. 




 What is your answer? Currently it's "Iron Dome doesn't work!" Then why are there no injuries? 




 I am looking for a reason you can give as to why there are no injuries or damage in Tel Aviv. So far you have failed to provide one.
 




 ok my bad. Israelis are the most awesome, most educated, most aware people in the world. They know everything before it happens.

If you lived in Israel then, you could see that the Patriot system didn't work, which is what people said at the time. If you live in Israel now, you can see that Iron Dome is working. How is this so difficult to get through your thick skull? Why do you believe a bad analysis of grainy images of eyewitnesses you said the true thing both times?
 




  maybe the iron dome is 90% effective...but maybe it's just like with the patriot system and it's all bs.

Again, my parents looked out their window in Tel Aviv, and saw the damage being done by the scud missiles and how the Patriot system was failing. People look out their windows now and see how Iron Dome is succeeding. Are you going to respond to this point? 

The point, that you clearly missed, is that what people THINK they know today, typically turns out to be wrong when they actually look at the details later.

And proposals vs. weapons systems being fired are two totally different things. At least the analogy to the patriot system is actually legitimate even if it shows how Iron Dome is working. A vague "wake up sheeple!" isn't going to convince anyone, you know.
 




 You're right. I was just distinguishing between batteries (of which adding more in the same area would be mostly redundant) and multiple interceptors per battery, which are already used. 




 They are adding more batteries to different areas to ensure complete protection, for example if the north and south are both attacked at once. In 2012 there were 4 or 5 batteries, I think know there are about 10 and more are being added. There is also much more support for the "Iron Beam" proposal which would stop short range mortars. 




 yet the reality we found out after the fact was that is worked less tahn 10% of the time.

And Israelis', who were the ones who were supposedly protected by it, knew during the conflict that it wasn't working. Just like they know now the Iron Dome is working.

you gotta open your mind and ears.

Fine, point me to the best. Your argument currently comes down to "wake up sheeple!" 




 Your argument would hold water if you were talking about not developing it in the first place because of the cost. You're saying this:

yes that's the problem...what people "~~see~~ want" and the reality it's used for are quite often different.

We can see what Iron Dome is doing *right now.*

look at the patriot act - after 9/11 every single person was gung ho for it because it seemed like it's protectingus.

now? it's the most unpatriotic thing and a tool for all of the recent NSA abuses.

And people warned about that when it was passed. This is a weapons system, not a law or planned war. Your analogies are awful. 




  The evidence for this is that only 22 people have died in over 15,000 rocket attacks over a decade.

This is where you analysis absolutely fails. Yes, people have died in roughly the same numbers because of other security measures, **but injuries and damages** are massively down. That is not pure chance.

you are raging so hard you didn't realize the 10% figure is the number of the effectiveness of the Patriot system. The same system that the US claimed is 90% effective...similarly to how Israel claims the Iron Dome is effective.

we won't know til later - like we found out about the patriot system.

Except Israelis knew during the Gulf War that the patriot system wasn't working by looking out their windows, just like they know the opposite now.

 




 That was the argument as to why not develop it in the first place. But the vast majority of the cost was paid in development and now it is working extremely well and people feel much safer, so no. It is actually a kind of celebrity. 




 I would more compare it to stopping a sexual assault, but whatever floats your boat! :P

I'm not here to argue with shitheads online, but to refute them so that other people reading are more informed. Trying to change posters' opinions here is useless. 




 now I understand why the bias and selective processing of information

Now you know why people like Iron Dome so much. It is not statistics released by the IDF, but what people see. 




 Mind if I copy paste this into my analysis above so we have a coordinated rebuttal? 




 I save my downvotes for Hams supporters on worldnews. Why I go there is still a mystery... 




 Israel doesn't have an military-industrial complex like America has, so the comparison to the patriot missile is bullshit. 

I agree. Take a look at the democracynow discussion. Guy makes some incredibly good points.


What are his best points? I can't see any very good ones? 




 This is an edited letter I sent to a news publication earlier to show why the 5% figure is complete bullshit:

I can definitely state that Iron Dome's intercept rate is over 5%. 

**Statistics and Analysis**

First, his analysis is not new and is mainly based on Operation Pillar of Defense in 2012, not the most recent conflict, and was done using civilian photographs. (Weirdly, I can't find the original analysis itself, only reports of it.) It is not clear in yours or other articles whether he is stating that only 5% of total rockets, or 5% of rockets that Iron Dome fires at, are intercepted. A clarification would be nice in that respect, since the IDF only fires the Iron Dome when the missiles are headed to a built up area, since it are so expensive to use.

[Here is Ha'aretz on the 2012 analysis.](http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/how-many-rockets-has-iron-dome-really-intercepted.premium-1.508277
) Two articles([1](http://www.technologyreview.com/news/528916/israeli-rocket-defense-system-is-failing-at-crucial-task-expert-analysts-say/
), [2](http://www.technologyreview.com/view/528991/an-explanation-of-the-evidence-of-weaknesses-in-the-iron-dome-defense-system/
)) in the MIT technology review have been published about this. I believe the article you linked to is based on the second:

[Here are the latest IDF statistics](http://www.idfblog.com/blog/2014/08/05/operation-protective-edge-numbers/
) of rockets fired at Israel (note: as of 8/05):

* 3,360 rockets fired 
* 2,303 hit Israel (70%)
* 475 hit gaza (14%) 
* 584 intercepted by Iron dome (17%)

If the IDF claims an 80% success rate of Iron Dome, that means:

* they fired at about 730 (22% of total rockets)
* and missed 150 (5% of total rockets) 
* Most of the 2000+ rockets that did hit would have hit open areas, but not all.

5% effectiveness related to total rockets would be 150 intercepted, which is 20% attempted interceptions, nothing to sneeze at though still not great. 5% of attempted interceptions would be only about 40 rockets. Which is it?

**Refutation**

Second, His analysis is pretty easy to refute, not by looking at grainy images, but by looking at warnings, damages, and casualties. There have been over 30 sirens in the Tel Aviv area; unlike your article states, most of it is apartment buildings or high rises, not open space. (If you want to see a city with open space, go to Be'ersheva.) As far as I can tell, and I have been following updates closely, there have not been one rocket reported to actually hit the area. How is this possible if Iron Dome only intercepts 5% of the rockets it launches at? The expensive, Iranian made Fajr-5 missiles actually use a targeting system and would be aimed toward civilian populations.

And the places further south (Kiryat Melachi, Ashdod, Ashkelon, etc.) seem to have much less damage than they did in the 2008 war. You're the reporter, not me, so this is something you can research, but my impressions were that it was unsafe to at all live in those areas during that war, and there was a lot of destruction. This year, there have been very few reports of damages, while I remember almost every day I heard about rocket damage in 2008 and 2012. 
During this operation there have been only **3 civilian deaths and 22 injuries** (according to the IDFblog which seems to have stopped updating in mid-July, but I can't imagine that it is more than 50 injuries) while in 2008, according to Wikipedia, **600+ were injured** (4,000 rocket attacks) and in 2012 it was **almost 300** (3,000 rocket attacks). This is another place your analysis and/or the professor's fails; yes, the deaths are about the same, but as he says deaths are unlikely anyway. However, injuries and damages are dramatically down while rockets, and more targeted and damaging rockets, are up. This would make no sense if Iron Dome wasn't working. 

*TL;DR A 10-20 fold decrease in injuries, and massively reduced reports of damages, is absurd if Iron Dome wasn't successful.*

**Feeling of Security**

Furthermore, anyone on the ground can tell you there is a large difference between this war and 2008. There is a different sound if a rocket hits the ground, a rocket explodes on the ground, or an Iron Dome intercepts a rocket. There have been multiple reports of shrapnel falling from destroyed rockets. People feel much safer because they notice my points above. **Iron Dome is not a celebrity in Israel because people see it shooting and the IDF publishes statistics, but because they can see that the destruction from Hamas is severely limited now that it has been deployed all across the south.**

**Conspiracy**

Final point: It would require an incredible conspiracy to cover all of this up (/r/conspiracy levels!). There are lots of people working or have worked on Iron Dome, and they would have to prevent anyone from speaking about its failure. If there has been damages from rockets hitting buildings, like the one that killed 3 in 2012, it would need to be covered up. If there were no rockets fired at the Tel Aviv area, the only other conclusion from my above analysis, then fake Red Alert sirens would have to be ordered and then covered up. None of these are plausible.

Is it possible the IDF is exaggerating somewhat? Possibly. But nothing on the order of a 5% of claimed interceptions or of total rockets. We would be seeing entirely different results on the ground if that was the case.

Edit: Your points are addressed above as well, but to show specifically why you are wrong:

it has more to do with the crude and shitty rockets being used than the Iron Dome.

Then why are damages and injuries down so much if Iron Dome wasn't working?

 Also, the thing that keeps Israelis safest isn't the Iron Dome - it's the incredibly effective and well deployed early warning system that allows people to find cover quickly

Absolutely. But even with this system over 600 people were injured in 2008, and we are seeing nothing on that level today. Statistics of damages are much harder to find, but it seems to be a lot less as well.

Studies have shown that even a 5 second warning, allowing someone to lie/duck down and cover, increases surivability by 60%+ Makes sense if you think about the explosion and trajectory of debris.

**Survivability =/ Injuries.** Yes, they might survive, but could still be moderately or severely injured. Your analysis doesn't explain the discrepancy. 
 




 From what I've read, it's mostly three and four. There are already 3 potential interceptors fired from each battery before the rocket hits the ground, and each interceptor costs $20,000 to fire.

 




 He hasn't been following the news. The 90%+ figure was only at the start of this conflict. 




 So you should support Al-Qaeda and not Hamas! 




 This article was published today and the Jerusalem post is a pretty major news source. 




 Everyone remember this: Hamas first says one thing to the west and then another thing to their supporters. The same will come out about the death count in Gaza once everyone has stopped paying attention; innocent civilians will magically transform into heroic martyrs who fought to the death. 




 Is there any statement in American law which says the purpose of American citizens is to follow those laws? 




 Ok, now I'm just confused what your response has to do with my original comments... 




 Operation Protective Edge is not Operation Brother's Keeper, and both occurred with provocations, not randomly. 




 Yep, just correcting because these kinds of misconceptions can be easily propagated, as the history of christianity shows. 




  The kitzur's issue with flames not being at the same height (and the Ah"S would probably agree) is the latter. 

Except aren't these requirements still valid whether or not a shamash is present? This seems to indicate that the problem addressed is showing that the 8 as one unit but still distinct from one another, not that they are a unit which are separate from the shamash.

 




 Also, KJV, not JKV.

Thanks.

The simple fact that a significant portion of rabbinic texts are written in Aramaic and are, in many cases, considered more authoritative than the original text of the Hebrew Bible itself undercuts the notion that Hebrew was the authoritative language.

Yes, all true. But you said:
the only accepted version of the Qur'an is one that is in Arabic, whereas this is not the case with the Hebrew Bible

scriptural texts written in English...are all just as authoritative as the original languages

This is what I am disputing, not that there are many texts written in other languages in Jewish and halachic literature. You are giving the impression that the **translation** of a Hebrew Bible into English, or a Talmud into the same, is as authoritative as the original text.

 




 Are either of these two things incorrect? Jewish converts to Christianity are not expected to follow the Torah, and from a Jewish viewpoint worshipping Jesus is idolatry.  




 Yes, but it is an addendum and not part of the requirement. It reads like this:

Do not follow a man who leads you astray by telling you to worship other Gods, even if he performs miracles, for God is testing you by sending him. 




 Yes? All 8 candles must be recognizable as being lit together -- but the shamash must be separate so as not to be confused, which I see as the biggest problem here. Neither of your sources here seem to address that. 




 Just so that there is no bad blood between us, I never downvoted you. 




 From what I have learned, it is the commonly held belief in Rabbinic Judaism after the fall of the second Temple. Even among the modern, liberal streams of Judaism translations are much more acceptable but not authoritative, especially compared to how the JKV is treated among many Christian sects. Do you have a source that says otherwise? 




  If that's true provide a reference for it.

Start with [this wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_and_antisemitism). Click on the links on top of the subsections for expanded explanations. This is all burned into the Jewish collective memory.

Reference?

See the link above, specifically the arguments among early church fathers and the Spanish Inquisition. If you want to read more on the latter, google conversos, crypto-Jews, and marranos.
 
Considered them backward? I thought they were tortured and killed? (Really, can you source any of this?)

Augustine is the most commonly given example. Again, read the opinions of early church fathers on Jews and Judaism. 




 Oh, I do that too. I mean that when the problem continues afterwards and they continue to complain without doing anything. 




 three months is "right after" now? Who knew! 




 Of course, I meant that the shamash flame must be different in some way from all of the others. 




  For many Christians and Jews, scriptural texts written in English (or French, or German, or Swahili, what have you) are all just as authoritative as the original languages. 

I do not believe that this is true in Judaism. The original language is always the best, as far as I have seen. 




 Would it be possible to delete the old bigoted posts? 




  Go talk shit about israel

Yeah, this might be the problem. Criticizing and talking shit are two different things. 




  we are held to a higher standard than the believers of the OT

How is not following the law being held to a higher standard? 




  In other words, jews follow the letter of the law and christian follow the spirit of the law.

The spirit of the Law is quite clearly to follow the letter of the law, which christians don't do.
 




 The person would be considered raised as a captive. That means that he would be breaking commandments (which is based on actions, not intentions) but would not be held as liable for what he did. 




 I meant that just because someone in Gaza tweets something expressing sympathy of someone in America does not mean that Hamas doesn't want to kill them. 




  Peter didn't do either of these two things. Or if he did, she me where (again, chapter and verse). 

1. The Church, which is based on Peter's teachings, told Jews to not follow the Law.

2. Peter and the Church both told Jews to follow other gods (Jesus). 

Fits pretty well.
 




 For very good reasons. 




 such as, that there were foods that "defiled a man", in the sense that they, of themselves, had the power of making someone unclean.

Why do you think that Jews ever taught this?

 I said above that Peter never instructed any Torah observant Jews to disobey one iota of Torah. Nor did I suggest anywhere that Jesus told any of his Jewish followers to disregard Torah.

Except it is your church that has multiple times, over the past 2000 years, given Jews living in its lands two options: convert or die. And if converted, they could not keep the old laws under pain of torture and death. Even when they were suffered to live, the Church considered them backwards for keeping the Law that God enjoined upon them, and celebrated converts from Judaism (who, incidentally, were not required to keep the Law).

 




  Jews were used to seeing Gentiles as "unclean", like dogs

Why do you think this is true?

These cleanliness laws, as well as circumcision, built up a "wall of separation" between Israel and "the Nations".

Why did God make a law, which he called eternal, only to tear it down a few years later?
 




 *Christianity* doesn't make sense. Don't tar all religions with the same brush, though. 




 Correction: A false prophet is someone who causes people to transgress by claiming that he is receiving a divine message. Performing miracles is not part of the criteria. The Torah just says that miracles should be irrelevant to the message. 




 There are only two things God created that can be classified as evil: death and free will. Just because God created them doesn't mean he cannot be good. 




 I guess hit on = attempted rape now... 




 From what I learned in high school, the most important thing (edit: in this case) is that the Shamash is distinct. Both could work if you place a visibly different candle in the shamash holder, I think. 




 Then can you also explain why women *do* it? "Venting" without wanting a solution, ever. Sympathy without a solution, like the person above said. 




 Send a few "summary" paragraphs and ask him out on a date. Otherwise it's a little bit too much in the beginning. Use the rest to guide how you would like to express your feelings in person. 




 Could you list/link to all the army ranks in Hebrew with the english equivalents?  




 You mean the one that the US took over through an aggressive war less than 200 years ago? Mexico has a right to that land!  




 They'll be faulted regardless of what they do. 




 Hamas =/ individual Palestinians 




 Many of the alleged conspirators are Hamas members who were released as part of the Shalit deal and then rearrested. These are the same people that Hamas is demanding be set free as part of the ceasefire negotiations.

I wonder how this will change the Hamas-PA unity pact which has still been technically in effect throughout this war? 









 From a previous point of mine about why Isaiah 53 is clearly about Israel:

Isaiah 53 is very clearly talking about the Children of Israel, though it is obscured by the way Christians separated the chapters. If you look at 52: 13-15 (which is the same section that starts with chapter 50), you can see that the prophet introduces a "servant" in third person. 13 says that the servant will be exalted, 14 that (in past tense) "marred beyond man is his appearance," 15 that (in future tense) how kings and nations will react.

Then, in 53:1, the narrative shifts to the perspective of those kings and nations, who are talking about the servant after he has risen and exalted. In the past, "he had not form," "he was despised," etc. But now "He has grown," "he might see offspring," etc. Then in the second half of verse 11 the narrative shift back to prophet, who describes the servant a bit more.

Now how is it possible that, during the time the prophet was speaking, Jesus was already marred, and that nations were appalled (did this ever happen?). Only in the future will the nations say "As one who hid his face from us, he was despised, we held him to no account." Did they ever say this about Jesus? On the other hand, (the house of) Israel fulfills all of this! In context with chapters 52 and 54, if one is a believer, one could see the prophecy be fulfilled today. If you read the entire section, chapter 53 is actually the pivot between a mourning Israel/Jerusalem and a joyous one, it makes sense why Israel would be referred as a "suffering servant" here. 




 Me? No. Do some commentators? Yes. 




 Judaism's view: It's a debate whether it was slight of hand or actual magic.  




 Do you want me to go through these and show that each and every one is, to quote from above, "not a prophecy at all, not a messianic prophecy, or taken so far out of context that it's purported to mean the opposite of what it actually means?" 




 How is this the letter of the law? Sabbath mode just disables the electronic displays and auto turn off. It's the exact same thing as having a constant fire going. 




 It'd be like saying that we can worship other Gods now

Funny thing us, that is what was done with Jesus and all afterwards. 




 What's interesting is that the symptoms described by galphanore are very similar to the real ones after fasting/long term malnourishment. But the latter are a lot more...insidious, I guess? 




 It's too goddamn long and not much happens. 
























 You have a lot of Jesus says in that paragraph. If Jesus is preaching a trinitarian god, different from the unitary one previously revealed, why should we believe him? 




 I have answers, I'll type them up when off mobile.

Edit: Ok, let's break this down. I'm not going to address whether this Psalm is messianic or not, but the claim that the Messiah is also God. First, a readable text:

2              

3          

4     

5         

6        

7        

8            

9       

10        

The first five verses are saying the king (or the hero of the king perhaps) is strong, righteous and blessed by God, and so will defeat the kingdom's enemies. Simple enough, and it could be referring to the Messiah if you look at it the right way. Then, right after the enemies are defeated:

7        

There are a few different translations that could work here for the first half of the verse.

You throne, God, is established for eternity,

OR

Your heavenly/divine/majestical (lit: of God) throne is established for eternity,

The translation clearly goes by the second. The verse, like many in Hebrew poetry, has two halves which parallel one another. The second half says "your scepter of kingship is a scepter of fairness." Both describe an object that has two properties. The first has a godly and everlasting throne, the second has a scepter that symbolizes kingship and fairness. The parallel breaks down if you say that  addresses God. It is an adjective, not a noun. Note that the Christian English translation writes it that the verses are broken up differently to obscure this.

8            

You have loved justice and hated wickedness, therefore, God--your God--has anointed you with oil of mirth beyond that of your friends" (friends could also be kinsmen).

The confusion comes from how the verse is punctuated; , your God, is actually a descriptor of , God. **The person addressed is not named in this or in any other verses of the psalm.** Why can't the verse be read like you translated above? Because the noun following the verb must be the subject, not the object, of the sentence. In addition, the object is already a part of the verb. Literally, it reads:

Anointedyou, God yourGod, oil...

The lack of spaces is deliberate in order to demonstrate how the grammar is written. The verb/object is the first word, and the subject-adjective are the second and third words. There is only one direct object contained in that phrase, not two.

Therefore, the person being addressed (perhaps the Messiah) has been (figuratively) anointed by God and given a godly throne. The next two verses describes his other blessings that he receives after conquering. There is no double God hinted at here.

P.S. Yes,  can also mean judge, FYI, like in Deutoronomy 17. 




 **That's the problem.** why should we change to a thread text which throws away the old when the latter tells us this is the exact situation we should avoid? 




 OK, under that criteria bar-kochva is the messiah, and he'll finish when he comes back any day now. He certainly got further than Jesus did. Why do you think he's not the Messiah and Jesus is? 




 And I'm not entirely sure how I got into this conversation in the first place :/

You posted in a thread about OT prophecies, so I'm not sure what you were expecting! :P and I know nothing about the epistles, so it's OK.

Can you explain to me the difference?  

Sure. Since annointing someone was standard practice when they were raised to a position of authority, (king, priest, etc.). So these are all "anointed ones" or messiahs. The term The Messiah, the one who would lead Israel to redemption, came from the fact that the Jews had no self governing leaders for a long time, and thus no anointed ones. So it came to mean "the one who will be anointed" when the Jews are free.

I'll get to the rest when I'm off mobile. 




 Look at this thread on /r/debatereligion to see that logic in action. 




 In my mind, the definitive way to tell if Jesus was the Jewish Messiah would be to compile a list of all the Messianic prophecies and compare them to Jesus' life as documented in both the New Testament and in secular sources and see if he fulfilled every single one of them.

Luckily for you, this has been done before. Jesus did not fulfill the most obvious prophecies. /r/Judaism/wiki/jesus

Edit: Oh God, that site is awful. I'll take the time to debunk it if you respond here. 




 The trinity is not found in the Bible. They are one in purpose, but not in being.

Oh right, you're Mormon. Well, that's even worse, honestly. "You shall have no other gods before me."

[Citation Needed]


/r/Judaism/wiki/Jesus

 




 I believe that that verse is one of the songs of the suffering servant, is that not correct? 

That's right.

Is there anything about the Messiah that claims he is not a servant of the Lord? Messiah, after all, just means "anointed one".

First, there are two different meanings of messiah -- an anointed one, used a lot in the historical parts of the Bible, and **the** Messiah, which is used is some of the prophets. I've found that Christians often confuse the two.

Second, of course the Messiah will be a servant of God. That doesn't mean that this prophecy is about the Messiah, like it is claimed. :P Why do you think is specifically about the Messiah as opposed to anyone else?

I think this is talking about the children of Israel, not the Messiah. A previous write up of mine:

 Isaiah 53 is very clearly talking about the Children of Israel, though it is obscured by the way Christians separated the chapters. If you look at 52: 13-15 (which is the same section that starts with chapter 50), you can see that the prophet introduces a "servant" in third person. 13 says that the servant will be exalted, 14 that (in past tense) "marred beyond man is his appearance," 15 that (in future tense) how kings and nations will react.

 Then, in 53:1, the narrative shifts to the perspective of those kings and nations, who are talking about the servant after he has risen and exalted. In the past, "he had not form," "he was despised," etc. But now "He has grown," "he might see offspring," etc. Then in the second half of verse 11 the narrative shift back to prophet, who describes the servant a bit more.

 Now how is it possible that, during the time the prophet was speaking, Jesus was already marred, and that nations were appalled (did this ever happen?). Only in the future will the nations say "As one who hid his face from us, he was despised, we held him to no account." Did they ever say this about Jesus? On the other hand, (the house of) Israel fulfills all of this! In context with chapters 52 and 54, if one is a believer, one could see the prophecy be fulfilled today. If you read the entire section, chapter 53 is actually the pivot between a mourning Israel/Jerusalem and a joyous one, it makes sense why Israel would be referred as a "suffering servant" here.
 
 









  Jesus was, after all, an unlearned Jew

Wait, I thought it was claimed he was a rabbi?

I don't find the argument that they're pulling things out of context to pull the wool over those unfamiliar with the prophecies convincing.

I wouldn't find it convincing either, except for the preponderance of evidence. I don't see any other way there are so many seemingly deliberate mistakes.

looking at the context of those verses and finding it ambiguous whether or not it is referring to the messiah. 

Do you want to discuss one or more you find particularly strong or noteworthy? It's why I made the rebuttal in the first place.
 




 It's only talked about when Israel is killing them. It's ignored otherwise. 




 [Here's one](http://christianity.about.com/od/biblefactsandlists/a/Prophecies-Jesus.htm) that's been linked to three times on this forum that I've seen. [Here's](http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/messianicprophecies.html) a second I've seen once. I've refuted them but have yet to see someone respond to my comment.

First debunking:

  

 I'm not going to debunk each prophecy, but group into different categories. We can discuss them further from there. Note: I will not be looking at Psalms, as it is poetry and not prophetic. You can try to prove that psalms in general is prophetic/if a specific verse is about the Messiah, if you want.
 
 Correct: 6, 7, 8, 16,
 
 Any Jew, only prophetic in a general sense: 4, 5, 6,
 
 About the Messiah but Misinterpreted: 2, 18
 
 Psalms: 9, 14, 17, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 27, 30, 32, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 41, 42, 43 (most, if not all, are not about the Messiah and are taken out of context. I will be willing to review each one once you prove Psalms can be prophetic.)
 
 Not about the Messiah: 1, 3/10, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19, 20, 21, 23*, 25/26, 28, 29, 31, 33, 35, 36, 39, 40, 44.
 
 To break the last category down for further discussion:
 
 Torah: 1, 15, 36
 
 Isaiah 53: 14, 28, 31, 40, 44
 
 Other Isaiah: 3/10, 13, 18-21, 29
 
 Other Prophets: 9, 11, 12, 16, 23, 25/26, 33, 39

Second dubunking:

 Correct: 7/8 (see disputations about genealogy),
 
 Any Jew, only prophetic in a general sense: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
 
 About the Messiah but Misinterpreted: 13, 14
 
 Psalms: 12, 14, 17, 18, 22, 23/24, 25/26, 34, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45
 
 Not about the Messiah: 9, 10, 11, 14, 18 (all Isaiah sources), 20, 21, 25/26/27/28, 29/31/40, 30, 32/33,
 
 About the Messianic age, not the Messiah: 14, 15, 16, 19
 
 Not a prophecy: 1, 35, 36

 




 What is Russia? I would have to learn the history of that country and region. Then the concepts of socialism and communism to understand the rise of the ussr and its leaders. Then how Russia got control of those countries behind the "Iron curtain." This would take me 2-3 hours at least, even granting that I already knew the terms contained within those articles.

I could go on, but you see how much background knowledge (memorization) you need just to read one sentence about the Cold War, let alone why it began. 




 I think it's pretty clear that it does not mean the city when looked at in the broader context.

My thought is that since Jesus didn't fulfill the messianic prophecies, the Gospel writers had to make up plausible sounding ones to convince people that he was actually the messiah. This, among lots of others, fit, so they took it out of context and (mis)used it. I've seen at least two lists of these "prophecies" recently, and the vast majority of the items are incorrect. 




 All of this requires concepts you only know through memorization. From a perspective of someone who knows the language but never encountered these terms before:

Was it the Soviets (who are they?), who reneged on their agreements (what were these agreements?) to allow the people of Eastern Europe (where is this in comparison to soviet? how many people are there? what is the culture?) to determine their own fates (were they kept locked in dungeons? what was their fate?) by imposing totalitarian rule (what kind of rule is this?) on territories unlucky enough to fall behind the "Iron Curtain?" (did the soviets hang a curtain around eastern europe?)
 




 Jesus never called His disciples to follow other gods. All of His ministry pointed towards the father.

The trinity is a "god not known", for God revealed himself as a perfect unity, which Jesus then changed to a trinity.

The Jews were also expecting a miraculous Savior to rise to the throne and free them from the Romans.

uh, yes, because that is what the prophecies say will happen. Jesus didn't do that. 




 What do you mean?  




 No, it says that the Messiah will be born of Bethlehem-Ephratah, the area where David was from. It is just another way of saying david's lineage. 




 What do you think the civilian casualty rate will be in the latest bombing campaign? 50%? 80%? And will it be by the American standard of any male between 16-40 is a combatant?

More importantly, will anyone talk about it when Israel isn't killing them? 




 Poe's law in action... 




 You might benefit from the use of E-Prime.

Yeah, sometimes that happens when I write quickly...

the only possible interpretation, and anybody who sees it differently is just crazy

...but I don't think I said this. On the other hand, I do believe I have the correct interpretation, and since this is a debate forum I state my opinion strongly and expect a strong rebuttal. 




 lol, ok 




 He never said that, just that these elements are present in Judaism. Which is true.

But they aren't used to coerce people to do anything, so it doesn't bear resemblance to the threat of hell and heaven in Christianity. 

Judaism includes Satan. Whether or not that is the "main point" of Satan in Judaism is subjective, and as a believing Jew, you'll prefer strongly an interpretation which favors Judaism.

You're still not getting it. It's not that satan isn't a main part -- it's that there is no "trickster to explain contrary evidence." The accuser does not have that role. Read the end of Job -- the point is that everything comes from God.

What religion, you mean. Certainly many do. But what is relevant for the purposes of this discussion is that Judaism includes this element.

I said group on purpose. I'm pointing out this element doesn't matter because nearly all groups, not just religions, have included this principle.


The way Jewish children are taught

I'm still not getting it. What is this "way"?

 I am not convinced it was designed to spread virally in as cynical and overt a way as Christianity was

That's because Judaism was never intended for that. Judaism is for the Jews -- or rather, Judaism is the religion for tribe of the children of Jacob, of which Judah was a remnant. It does not look to expand to other people; though it claims to have a supreme God, it also teaches that God made a special covenant for the Jewish people that only applies to them.

 




 Are not things written by prophets to be considered prophetic?

No. Take the absurd example: a prophet's tax bill is not a prophecy, yet he still wrote it. Not *all* things written by a prophet are prophetic.

I showed that some Jews did consider them to be so. 

No, you showed a Messianic splinter sect considered them to be so, relating the Psalms to themselves. Interestingly, "a Messianic splinter sect" is exactly what Christianity was at the time, so I was noting that they both used the same technique of taking random verses and applying them to the present day.

Why quote any of the psalms, then, if no Jews thought that they were prophetic?

As I said above, because it's a common Messianic tactic. See how easy it was to make you believe that because it is holy it is also a prophecy if you read it the right way?

I'm not quite sure what you mean. I have been citing websites as I go--perhaps you just missed those links.

Your original pesher link. It would be nice to get a link which has sources, or even better, a scholarly paper. After that, we can talk about the actual meaning of pesher.
 




 Hey, you asked, I answered.
 




 If you contact the Rabbi or another person in the leadership before the holiday, they will probably give you one. 




 At the time of Jesus' life, some of the Psalms are considered to be prophetic, because some of them are written by David.

You have not demonstrated that this is *because* they were written by David. In addition, you have only quoted one splinter sect of Judaism, who happened to be messianic as well (like Christianity). These types of groups in general like to take unrelated writings and interpret them in light of the present day. Can you demonstrate anyone mainstream thought of Psalms as prophetic?

Also, please quote a website with actual links. That could be made up as far as we know, but I'm reserving judgement for now. 




  He always went on and on about how Jesus fulfilled all the prophecies

Also not true, fyi. There have been debates here before, and it usually comes down to "Jesus will fulfill all of them in the second coming." 




 Rav Kook and his followers, at the very least, are pretty famous. 




 It's the list again! I choose you, copypaste!

I'm not going to debunk each prophecy, but group into different categories. We can discuss them further from there. Note: I will not be looking at Psalms, as it is poetry and not prophetic. You can try to prove that psalms in general is prophetic/if a specific verse is about the Messiah, if you want.

Correct: 6, 7, 8, 16,

Any Jew, only prophetic in a general sense: 4, 5, 6,

About the Messiah but Misinterpreted: 2, 18

Psalms: 9, 14, 17, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 27, 30, 32, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 41, 42, 43 (most, if not all, are not about the Messiah and are taken out of context. I will be willing to review each one once you prove Psalms can be prophetic.)

Not about the Messiah: 1, 3/10, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19, 20, 21, 23*, 25/26, 28, 29, 31, 33, 35, 36, 39, 40, 44.

To break the last category down for further discussion:

Torah: 1, 15, 36

Isaiah 53: 14, 28, 31, 40, 44

Other Isaiah: 3/10, 13, 18-21, 29

Other Prophets: 9, 11, 12, 16, 23, 25/26, 33, 39
 




 4 .- Unverifiable reward if you act in a certain way.

5 .- And/or unverifiable punishment if you do not act in a certain way.

Neither of these points are relevant. Reward/punishment in the afterlife is not the main motivator to do miztvot.

6 .- Invisible trickster to explain away contrary evidence.

Doesn't exist as explained above.

3a .- Promote marriage between believers, within the faith, and have large family.

What group does NOT do this?

3b .- Indoctrination.

Want to explain what you mean? Judaism traditionally teaches a lot of critical thinking. Why do you think so many Jews become lawyers?
 




 What does this have to do with the Messiah? (Your translation is also awful, but we can get to that later.) 




 The same reason you don't analyze homer and at the same time discuss whether it actually happened. Every discussion needs to have axioms, or it goes nowhere. If you want to discuss the veracity of the text, make your own topic. 




 Nope. Being the messiah has nothing directly to do with God. 




 And Jesus didn't exist either, but we're discussing everything as if they're recorded accurately. We don't have to turn every discussion into a debate on the authenticity of the text.  




 A little bit. But they are generally well received or ignored, and they don't press if you refuse. 




 This is not converting, it's more like bringing lapsed Catholics back into the church. 




  Disclaimer: I'm not a Jew, so I might have misinterpreted my Jewish friends' answers to this question.

Nope, this is good. 

 




 I'll break it down point by point.

isn't Israel a specifically Jewish state,

Yes, much in the same way England is Anglican.

But aren't Zionists mostly European immigrants

I don't know what you mean by Zionists here; if you mean Jewish Israelis, it's about evenly split between Ashkenazim and Sefardim/Mizrachim, although the distinction is slowly disappearing.

isn't Zionism not much older than 100 years old?

Zionism, the ideology that Jews should create a state of their own to escape persecution is about 150 years old now, yes. The Jewish longing to return to the "land of Israel" is 2000 years old.

 So up until just over a hundred years ago, waiting for the coming of the messiah before founding a state was something specifically about being Jewish, right?

Yes and no. Before the Enlightenment, there wasn't a concept of "setting up a state." A king ruled a territory, and the Messiah would be a new king who re-established the Kingdom of Israel. There is a thought (it's only one opinion) that Jews should not attempt to self-govern until we are worthy, which will be when the Messiah comes. But there is a tension here: how would you recognize the Messiah if you refuse to attempt to gather in from exile?

It all just seems paradoxical because Zionists seem like reformists

Do you mean Reform, as in Reform Judaism? No, most of the early Zionists were secular, not reform, though there was a significant religious minority involved in the early zionist movement. Most of the Reform movement actually criticized Zionism quite a bit before WWII, since their ideologies were so strongly opposed to one another.

and if we create a Jewish state, it seems like the reformists should have less of a say than the orthodox

They did. Israel is a mostly secular Jewish state, just like England.

but the orthodox don't want the state

No longer true. Many Haredim in Israel are disapproving of the state and try and undermine it, but many others support it. There are many other "Modern Orthodox"/Daati Leumi who are very much Zionists. Both of these groups vote and therefore get a say in running of the state in proportion to their vote.

so we shouldn't listen to them on religious grounds, but its a specifically Jewish state.

These two points have nothing to do with each other.

 Its not like Protestants have much of a say on what happens in the Vatican, but even if they did the Catholics should have first say

Bad analogy. These are two different religious groups, not a religious and a secular group.

I mean if an Orthodox Jewish state is contradictory to the original tenants of Judaism, 

It's not in any way contradictory. There is one opinion saying that Jews shouldn't attempt to return on their own, and I already discussed the tension inherent in it.

then is it still a Jewish state, or just a state obsessed with ethnic purity?

Why do you think Israel is obsessed with ethnic purity more than any other country. About 20% of the population is not Jewish. In addition, Israel is still a Jewish (or more accurately, Israelite) state even if it has no religious laws, just like England is an ethnically English state.

...Unless its just an ethnically Jewish state, in which case wouldn't all orthodox Jews outside of Israel become defacto diaspora?

It is an ethnically Jewish state. And yes, all orthodox Jews consider themselves in the diaspora, but that has nothing to do with the state. 




 None of your points here are accurate. 




 Judaism was founded at the exodus and revelation, not by Abraham. He was apparently a great person who brought a lot of good to the world, including monotheism, but Judaism came later. Nor did he or does he fill a savior role (a concept which doesn't really exist in judasim).

Judaism is not, and never has been, a monastic religion. Abraham was famously wealthy, and the Israelites took lots of gold out of Egypt. 

Judaism is a communal religion which doesn't work without family.

There are no rewards for believing or disbelieving, only doing.

There is no trickster. The satan, or accuser, is best likened as a malicious prosecuter in court.

There is no apocalyptic event, only a redemption. 




 This does not apply at all to Judaism.  




 Huh? The whole state of Judaism is waiting for their Messiah to return Israel to its glory.

Not true.

they rejected Jesus because the Messiah came to save the whole world, not just the Jews.

Also not true. 

From below: 

Who are "they"? The Jews prophesied about a Messiah. Read Isaiah especially. He prophesied of a coming Messiah who would be rejected by his own people.

Three strikes, and yoooooou're out!

Is it? Christianity started in Judea and was brought to Rome. And Asia. And Africa. All within the first century. 

Not very impressive, considering you could travel for 5 days and reach any of these continents.

It is not based on the wisdom of a Roman emperor; it is based on the life and teachings of a middle-eastern Jewish rabbi who claimed to be the son of God, and Christ came for everyone, not just Western society.

No, it was based on Paul and early Catholic church, which was established in (guess where?) Rome! 




 I think they're one seat lower than Yesh atid now. 




 Do you want to have a discussion about your points? 




 Yes, it exists, though most people when trying to use it ask improperly. It is usually not formal though. For example, we had to get a passing non-Jew to turn off the oven. 




 Why not? 




 Because those rockets were fired, dimwit. Read the godam article. The false alarm was this morning, which hasn't been reported anywhere.
 




 Wrong verse. [Numbers 23:19] 




 Not a ger myself, but it is probably because it happens so often outside of deep/personal conversations. I can see how it gets annoying, and somewhat implies that you don't belong. 




 Aaaand you don't know about Judaism, apparently. Stop projecting your experience with Christianity or Islam onto all other religions. 




 Aaaand you don't know about Judaism, apparently. Stop projecting your experience with Christianity or Islam onto all other religions. 




 But of course, when we calmly and positively talk about having sex with a three year old

That you say this means you are completely misunderstanding the entire section. This is a legal discussion, not a code of conduct. 




 No, these were people and their descendants who were there in 1920-1950, and had been living there for hundreds of years. Does the same principle apply? 




 The right of return isn't about returning to a country, it's about returning to what is rightfully your home.

If you acquiesce to thousands of Haredi Jews returning under this definition to Hebron and Jerusalem, as well as all the Mizrachi Jews and their descendents to their homes in the Arab world, I might start taking you seriously. Until then... 




 Oh, I think it's an awful practice that should be stopped, outside of a few people who the community itself should support as well. I probably would have voted for Yair Lapid in the last Israeli election, who advocated and passed a measure to slowly change this.

I think that it is justified in that it is not viewed as stealing; if the state will provide for them to engage in studying, they'll take it. Work is not valued in the intrinsic way that it is in much of Western society, and learning Torah is much more important than contributing (or stealing) from the country. 




 Actually, from my limited knowledge, this is not a very common practice in America. Many people do study at yeshiva, yes, but not their entire life. The practice is much more widespread and pronounced in Israel. 




 I've just been recommended Hearthstone by a friend. I'm a previous casual Magic player -- I know the basic rules, mechanics, and strategies, but never bothered building my own deck because it was too much of hassle, so I didn't play very often. 

What should I know going into the Hearthstone? What are the similarities and differences to Magic, and what should I be expecting? A basic overview would be nice! Thank you! :) 




 Once palestine is established, you will have the right of return to Palestine just as Jews have the right to return to Israel. 




 It depends on where you live. Just search Nintendo office (your country) in google.

 Mewtwo has finally decided, as Mew taught him, that violence is not the answer. He was invited to join both Brawl and Sm4sh (which is why the data was in brawl), but declined in order to instead pursue his peaceful, meditative existence on a secluded island. He spends his days catching up with old friends via telepathy and pondering ways to end violence among both humans and Pokemon. Though I loved playing with him in Melee, I hope he can continue to live at peace with himself. :)

 Exactly what they got out of it this time. Sequence of events:

* Hamas kidnaps and kills teenagers
*  Israel cracks down on Hamas members in the West Bank and starts sweeping manhunt
* Hamas uses this as an excuse to start bombarding southern Israeli residents with rockets
* Israel responds with limited airstrikes and proposes a few quiet-for-quiet agreements
* Hamas rejects these, as well as proposed ceasefires, while saying that it is responding to Israeli aggression; Israel begins official military operation
* Palestinians, militants and civilians, die, as well as a few Israeli civilians
* Ground invasion commences, after Hamas attacks from tunnels, with the purpose eliminate those tunnels; 
* Hamas gets the opportunity to kill and kidnap soldiers, and put many more Palestinian civilians at risk during the fighting
* Israeli ground invasion concludes and ground troops withdraw after tunnels destroyed, as Israel declines to commence a full invasion to eliminate Hamas
* Hamas continues firing rockets, and Israel continues attacking by air
* Hamas accepts a ceasefire once they are close to running out of rockets

The potential and real accomplishments of starting a fight with Israel:

* Increased popularity, both at home and abroad, especially vis a vis Fatah
* Increase donations by terror funders (i.e. Qatar) and well meaning countries and individuals
* Dead Israeli civilians and soldiers
* Captured Israeli civilians and soldiers
* Potential for a massacre of Israelis through fighters emerging from tunnels
* Dead Palestinian civilians to show to the world
* Dead Palestinian militants to show as civilians to the world
* Pressure on Israel to ease blockade 
* Increase support for the right wing in Israel

I could go on, if you want more. It's theorized this round of fighting started now to weaken the unity government/Fatah as well as get more money, since civil servants weren't being paid due to lack of funds. 
 




 Can you go into more detail as to why regular electric watches are allowed? 




 To clarify, it is a law not to eat animals not slaughtered properly, which has the side effect of also avoiding animals which die by disease. 




 No. 




 Nonono, you don't understand, I posted that to make people think I'm a real person instead of a paid shill! And you're my sockpuppet that I made to point it out! Get your act together, man! 









 Nope, it's actually pretty much the translation above, though of course a lot of nuance is lost. 




 I'm saying that the translation is wrong. The text is not talking about a spiritual disease which no longer exists, not the medically defined leprosy of today. 




 It would be. But we're not discussing leprosy. 




 Oh, you have every right to think that it's ridiculous. Just know what it is that you're criticizing.  




 Some few kibbutzim are still doing well. 




  Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill.

It's a spiritual disease caused by gossip, and it has a spiritual cure.  




 the punishment for breaking any of them is execution.

Not true. 




 http://i.imgur.com/axJmn.gif 




 It's not goddam leprosy! 




 Whether it is or is not, you didn't write the trivial part. 
























 Hiding in tunnels and telling civilians to disregard evacuation orders is facing the enemy directly? Oh Lord.  




 Find me another that says a massive amount of people who happens to be your anscestors witnessed a miraculous event. 




 Yeah, by a group of people we would call Orthodox Jews.

Yes, because no other Judaism existed. Regardless, your claim about Hebrew being a dead language, only used by the clergy, is incorrect. Again, we don't have to talk about past interpretations; look at the verse in Hebrew now.

 A copy of a copy can have no greater than 100% fidelity, and mistakes aggregate and are rare to correct.

Have you looked at the process of copying the Torah? It is extremely accurate.

Still interpretation.

Yes, but other interpretations is not "just as likely to be correct" as mine, because of these rules.

If that hebrew is the same as the hebrew spoken now, why would we have needed interpretation of it 2000 years ago?

Of course it does. What does it mean to not cook a kid in it's mother's milk, and why is it repeated three times in different sections? What does it mean, slaughter an animal as I have instructed you?

But a cheeseburger can be made without even cooking the cheese with the burger, so it clearly isn't prohibited by the Torah itself.

It depends. How do you define cooking?

You don't worship a different God. You don't have a moral standard that allows the killing of innocents. You believe in charity and helping you fellow man. You believe in obeying the laws of the society in which you live. You believe courts are a valid way of resolving disputes. There are religions that disagree on each of these values.

Many Christian sects also agree on all of these, and they are separate. That's what I was pointing to.

Now onto your supposed list of agreement.

All divisions of Jewish faith believes that the messiah has not come.

Not true, and hasn't been in the past. Of course, some would not call messianic chabad Jewish...

They believe that the sabbath should be kept holy, and is on the seventh day of the seven day week: Saturday. 

Reform believes you don't have to, and even celebrated it on Sunday in the 1800's!

There are no differences I am away of between newer Jewish practices and Orthodox practices that are bigger than these differences between Judaism and Christianity:

Yes, but I'm not saying that. Judaism is very much different than Christianity. But some of the major differences between Christian sects are much smaller than between the major Jewish denominations. 




 It's not just that it happened to many people, it's that it happened to many people who happen to be our ancestors.  




 Hebrew was a dead language for many centuries, spoken only by 
clergy

Not true, it was used by everyone for prayer and study, and was also used as a base for derivative languages. It was never dead, unlike Latin. And since it has recently been revived with mostly the same base, it's pretty easy to get a correct translation. I can go over the verse in depth if you want.

As for cheeseburgers: that's your interpretation, don't cook the two together.

No, that is not my interpretation. That is the interpretation of the mishna, which is the recording of rabbi's statements from 100 BCE to 100 CE. This is the only interpretation Judaism has had for at least 2000 years, more if the Pharisitic claims about the Oral Law are accurate, as Orthodoxy holds.

There are other interpretations of what "unclean" means with regards to pork.

Nope, it's pretty concrete. It says don't eat it.

It's all interpretation

But there are rules and bases for the interpretation. 

and these differences are relatively minor in practice compared to other religious differences.

Not true. There are significant practical issues in eating in a non-kosher home, for example. In fact, there are many more practical issues with different interpretations than many Christian sect splits.
 




 Is it no drinking and no eating? 




 It's a moral tale, not a history. 




 No, it is clear it is not about the dead, because then "for the dead" would be written at the end of the verse, not in the middle. 

And if we consider the origin of this command, it serves as a way to distinguish ourselves from Canaanites.

The whole point is that Orthodoxy's view of the laws are they are in effect forever, no matter what the origin is.

Where is it written that a new may not eat a cheeseburger?

"Do not cook a kid in its mother's milk" is interpreted as "do not cook meat and milk together." 




 Leviticus 19:28 




 Yes and no. Just don't use either when you are referring to God, and no one will have a problem. 




 Why a fast if it's a celebration? 




 Writing Jehovah's Witnesses is fine, just don't actually use that name for God. 




 Probably about 50% of Jewish male names have God's name in one way or another. The rest are historical. 




 *shrug* Christianity doesn't make any sense to me either. It's not more well known because there there is no one proselytizing to Christians, and most Christians don't seek out opposing arguments. 




 That's great! Maybe talk to the theology professor beforehand about your concerns? If they're Jewish, they'll probably understand where you're coming from.

Also, if you're interested, join some of the nerdy clubs on campus. They usually have less of the drinking/banging than the rest.

Have you figured out what to do when people try to convert you? 




 For to us a child has been born, to us a son has been given

This part is past tense, not present tense. Why exactly is an issue of context, but right off the bat what you have is incorrect. Also note that they capitalized child and son to make them seem divine, but there is no such indication in the Hebrew.

and authority/power has been on his shoulders

Government here makes no sense. Settled is an inserted word; the only verb in this phrase is "to be." This is also past tense, not future.

And he has been named

Again, past tense.

Now we come to the names. Hebrew does not have a present tense "is" verb, so this can be taken as a list or "___ is ____". Let's take it word by word.



This is not wonderful, but wonder. It could be an adjective, but properly translated as wonderous.



This can either the verb or the noun: counselor or counseled/determined.

 

there is no "the" here; mighty God is the right translation. Certain phrasing in English will need the for proper grammar, but not the list form.



Again, not "the." Eternal Father.

-

Either:

* "prince of peace," a quality inherent in the prince;
* or "peaceable prince," a quality describing how he acts
* or "prince that makes peace," describing his actions.

I think I've demonstrated enough that your translation is inaccurate. How best to interpret it is up to debate. 

One final point: Just because the persons name has a quality of God does not mean that he is called God. My name has God in it, but I am not claiming divinity.

P.S. Looking at the Chabad/Rashi, he translates it as the name being -, while the rest is describing God. Also perfectly legitimate. And it makes sense that this is describing Hizkiyahu, because they were contemporaries and this does not seem to be a section about the Messianic age. 




 It doesn't. the translation Christian Bibles use are faulty. 




 Just because something is recorded doesn't mean it was the right thing to do. 




 Not exactly. It has a rotating board of rabbis, but it's something different than a sanhedrin, though they do make halachic rulings. 




 One last point. It's easy. Reporters no longer go into Syria, but they can easily talk about Syria from within Israel. 




 If you get me up to 80%+ and you're on the other side of the stage? You bet your ass I'm going to start spamming it. That's your fault I'm in such a good position, and it does take some skill to land it properly. 




 Just write God. That works best. 




 Bigotry of low expectations, right here folks. 




 8:28-29 says that there was a battle against the king of aram. Do you think this occurred?  




 Eh, there is a point for reform Judaism, but not so much conservative  




 [That's partialism, Patrick!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQLfgaUoQCw) 




 If what they say is right, then the stele is saying that their god is better because over time, during the reign of the king who worshiped that god, they prevailed over the objections of those other kings (and their gods), in taking all the land that they wanted to, from them.

Well, yes. It was written by Aram, after the battle with the kings of Israel in Judah. The same battle where the new Israelite King, according to the Bible, slew the two other kings. The king of Aram claims that he killed those kings, in contradiction to the biblical narrative. 

What battle? There is no such battle.

Read II Kings chapters 8-11 again. What do you mean, no battle?

They created a new history of Israel to fit how they interpret the inscription, ignoring what the Bible actually says.

Can you describe what history you're talking about? All I'm doing is quoting the bible. The researchers just matched up the half names on the steele to the names in Kings, not made up another history. What does the Bible "actually say"?

P.S. The various other claims of  means don't dispute the spelling, but the pronunciation. Like the Wikipedia article says, those claims are pretty weak. 




 Proponents of what interpretation? Who rewrote what? This is in the Bible that was canonized before Christianity even existed. What is your alternative?

And yes, Kings and the steele are definitely describing the same battle and outcome, but with two different claims of what happened. That is how history was written in those days -- each side claimed it won (hell, it still happens).

 That says nothing about joining forces against Judah. Even so, that is a prophecy of what will happen. To look at the actual events, read II Kings. 




 Of course it does. Read your Bible - start with II kings 8:16. You will find a separate narrative about the same events. 




 Apologize to the actual person, if you can. He'll appreciate it even if he never responds. 




 The "House of David" on the tel dan steele is referring to the King of Judah, not the king of Israel.
 

 




 Tell that to the Palestinians, who claim that no Jewish temple ever stood there. 




 I'm getting annoyed at my phone (Droid Razr HD) recently at a couple of things. It's getting hot when I'm not using it and the mobile data in on (just sitting in my pocket), using up a lot of battery power. It is also running really slowly, especially when switching between apps. So I have a couple of questions:

1. Is there any way to view and cancel background programs from running?
2. What might be the cause of using so much power when I'm not using my phone?
3. Is there any way to cancel individual app permissions?

If any of this requires me to root my phone, I would appreciate step by step instructions. Thank you! 




 He didn't fulfill the most important ones, namely bringing all the Jews back to Israel and ushering in a golden age for humanity. Which ones did he fulfill, do you think? 




 No, the OT says that Jesus rises from the dead doesn't make him a prophet or in the right. He's not the messiah for different, reasons, namely that he didn't fulfill those prophecies.

I don't come at Christianity with a presumption of Judaism, I come at it with the presumption of atheism

Wonderful, but Christianity itself bases its claims upon Judaism being correct. To be Christian means to accept the OT. 









 The NT definitely punishes thought crimes,

Alright, just please make the distinction between the NT and the OT then. 




  The law says "Don't be gay"

No, it says: "Men, don't have sex with men." Homosexuality wasn't even a concept at that point. Nowhere, outside of jealousy, does the Torah ever condemn thoughts. 




 You said the basis of your faith is that Jesus rose from the dead. But the OT, which you claim is authoritative, definitively says that this doesn't make a difference. How can you reconcile the two? 




 Next up, they'll have to ban premarital sex because it will lead to more mixed dancing, which "desecrates one of the fundamental principles of Judaism!" 




 I don't feel like a male thats effeminate, i feel like a woman

What do you mean if this doesn't include body dysphoria? 




 According to Wikipedia, Socrates was born in 470 BCE and Aristotle was born in 384. 




 Aristotle is typically put as one of the Fathers of Greek ~~philosophy~~ science. He lived in the 4th century BCE, a little after Malachi. 




 Why are you not comfortable identifying as male and just acting in different ways? 




 The fact that the Torah was revealed to all of Israel at once. 




 In Israel just a shroud, outside of Israel a box. 




 A human claiming "I am God" is certainly something different -- and rising from the dead doesn't prove it one way or another. 




 I don't need one. The Torah tells us not to listen to prophets who teach a contradictory message, no matter what miracles they perform. 




 The Romans, in order to insult the Jews more! 




 And if Jesus rose from the dead, it still doesn't prove anything. 




 National Revelation. 




 No it isn't! 




 Darkness is chosech, previously in the verse. Darkness is contrasted to light, and evil is contrasted to peace/wholeness. Where you get sin from, I have no idea. 




 A good discussion is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/2ac8t8/i_form_the_light_and_create_darkness_i_make_peace/citl9hi) 




 This will be incredible. But why for only those who purchase both...? 




 Ok, Huge Pizza Hog, I think it's time for you to begin. 




 SPECIAL SMASH IS BAAAACK!! 




 8 player smash confirmed!!! 




 But I thought that it was the father speaking that line, since Jesus hadn't previously revealed himself at all?

And anyone can forgive sins; someone comes to apologize to you for something they did to harm you and you forgive them. Poof. Bye sins! You have to do the same thing with God.

You still haven't answered me about Isaiah 43. You ready to debate that?

 




 I would assume you think so, that's what your argument it based on, inst it?
 




 You heard (read?) me. By the your circular logic that is true, but if Jesus didn't save anybody he can't be God, can he?
 




 In them two verses God is saying that there is no saviour beside himself, and verses including Acts 4:12, Luke 2:11, John 4:42 , etc declare that only Christ Jesus is the saviour of the world. Thus Jesus is God.

Or maybe those quotes are just...wrong?

Also, Isaiah 53 is definitely not about the Messiah, and certainly not about Jesus. ready to debate that? 




 Evil is the best translation, as in genesis 3.

 750,000 Palestinians were exiled

True.

through the use of terror attacks such as the Deir Yassin massacre

Not true. Deir Yassin is so infamous precisely because it only happened once, and not by the Haganah/IDF.

the destruction of hundreds of Palestinian villages

Never seen a good citation for this. Dozens? Probably, mostly along the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem road because they were being used as shelters for the attackers. Lod is another example. But most of the villages were in the Galil, and many were untouched or the inhabitants fled in advance.

 Palestinians were bound to retaliate in the following years.

800,000 Jews were exiled from Arab countries, and the inhabitants of the Old City, kfar etzion, and other areas had to evacuate, were expelled, or were massacred. Did they not have the right to retaliate?

 




 Fedayeen, I apologize. See [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_attacks_against_Israeli_civilians_before_1967), if you don't already know.

Also, the PLO itself was founded in 1964, but the groups that make it up (Fatah, etc.) existed before. Fatah, for example, was established in 1959. Many of the attacks didn't come from the PLO of today, but were carried out an sponsored by people who did form the group. ([See here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_fedayeen)) 




 I see a random list, of which at least 3 at first glance *were* during a war. You still haven't addressed the fact that one list starts at 48 and the other at 68. Look up the ~~mujadeen~~ fedayeen. 




 Just want to point out that the actual source is Aramaic, where it means "He created as he spoke." 




 Never made the news? There were at least three articles about it on *this* subreddit alone. And no, it doesn't provide any context whatsoever. Terrorism is never justifiable.  




 Why the hell are you starting at 1968 for the PLO? The groups that make it up go all the way back to Israel's founding. And the list doesn't even distinguish between military and civilian casualties. If you're trying to make a point, at least give correct information. 




 Then what are you saying? I have no idea what the attack and the connection is between the attack and freedom of movement. 




 Yes, a Hamas operative who has been in jail twice was traumatized by a traffic accident where the perpetrator turned himself in. That's why he killed a baby. 




 If the opponent is dodging a lt, short jump and a turning back slash is extremely effective. 




 The title is from the article. And I wouldn't be surprised if "settlers" is interpreted a bit too loosely; after all, Jews are classified as "members of an enemy state." 

 




 Yes. Are you saying that the fact Palestinians don't have freedom of movement justifies terrorist attacks? 




 What does that have anything to do with this attack?  




 I guess that's news to the Hamas driver who was travelling on the highway that goes straight through Jerusalem that serves both Israeli's and Palestinians. I guess it's also news to Palestinians in East Jerusalem that travel on this same light rail all the time between East and West Jerusalem.

**There are no travel restrictions between East and West Jerusalem, as the distinction currently exists only on a map.**

**There are no travel restrictions between East and West Jerusalem, as the distinction currently exists only on a map.** 




 Anyhow, more to your point the fact that Israelis can easily waltz across the border and not vice versa is kind of the problem.

The fact that Palestinians and Jews can travel freely in Jerusalem is a problem? 




 Not true. 




 The terror attack was literally [right at the border](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem_Light_Rail#mediaviewer/File:Jerusalemlightrailmap.png) between East and West Jerusalem, right on a highway, a couple of minutes walk from Palestinian neighborhoods. There could have easily been residents of West Jerusalem, tourists, students from Hebrew University, or Palestinians at the station. Are you condemning these people for simply *standing at train station?* 




 Are you really asking why people live in certain places? And did you really just call all of Israel a "Jewish settlement?" 




 Epi-genetic, based on temperatures after the eggs are laid. You can read more in [this explanation](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/experts-temperature-sex-determination-reptiles/) I found. 




 If you trust them, I'm sure you'll be able to find the original sources, right? 




 1. A video they don't link or name, and a statement by the obviously not biased Al-aqsa waqf.
2. Full of outright lies, myths, and STILL doesn't contain any information that anyone wants to destroy Al-Aqsa. 
3. Why does that have anything to do with Jews? 




 Radio? Everything I've seen just says that they praise the attack, but don't take credit. 




 The infant has died while at the hospital. 




 The baby has died, no news on the 8 others injured. 









 The part about uncomfortable/not confident people taking up less space is definitely true, as is the converse. 




 Same as kashrut. These laws are called "chukim" - there are no real explanations. 




 Are the ones is Gush Etzion settlers? Those who returned to their land after their parents were kicked out and massacred?  




 But if you know of them, you can much better understand what they are talking about. Take Isaiah, for example. Lots of Christians misinterpret the book because they have no idea in what time or for whom it was written. But if you do know, and read it in the original language, nearly all your points are moot. 




 And this is why you read it in the original language with knowledge of the authors. 









 It's a metaphor. Since angels don't have free will, everything they do is God's will. 




 The snake is Genesis 3 is just a snake, not Satan. 




 All is under God. Anything else is not monotheism. Is polytheism easier? Absolutely. But that is not what Judaism is. 




 Opposite. God created everything, including evil. The person talking to you about translation is completely wrong. 




 There have been two ([1](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/2chmoo/i_form_the_light_and_create_darkness_i_make_peace/), [2](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/2ac8t8/i_form_the_light_and_create_darkness_i_make_peace/)) recent threads about this recently. The second had the same discussion about moral evil happening now; my rebuttal is in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/2ac8t8/i_form_the_light_and_create_darkness_i_make_peace/citl9hi).

Pretty much all I have to say is there, if you want more details/explanation you can just reply to my comment here. 




 It's amazing how Christians don't seem to know their scripture. 

Chapter 29:

24 they and indeed all the nations will wonder, Why has the Lord done thus to this land? What caused this great display of anger? 25 They will conclude, It is because they abandoned the covenant of the Lord, the God of their ancestors, which he made with them when he brought them out of the land of Egypt. 26 They turned and served other gods, worshiping them, gods whom they had not known and whom he had not allotted to them; 27 so the anger of the Lord was kindled against that land, bringing on it every curse written in this book. 28 The Lord uprooted them from their land in anger, fury, and great wrath, and cast them into another land, as is now the case.

Essentially what Christians have been saying for a long time, including you above.

When all these things have happened to you, the blessings and the curses that I have set before you, if you call them to mind among all the nations where the Lord your God has driven you, 2 and return to the Lord your God, and you and your children obey him with all your heart and with all your soul, just as I am commanding you today, 3 then the Lord your God will restore your fortunes and have compassion on you, gathering you again from all the peoples among whom the Lord your God has scattered you. 4 Even if you are exiled to the ends of the world,[a] from there the Lord your God will gather you, and from there he will bring you back. 5 The Lord your God will bring you into the land that your ancestors possessed, and you will possess it; he will make you more prosperous and numerous than your ancestors.

**God will not abandon his people.** 




 I have heard that it is ok as long as no money is exchanged, barring ma'arit ayin. 




 Side note: where is the long list of prophecies that were actually fulfilled?

I have never seen an accurate one, probably because very little was actually fulfilled.

once to fulfil the law and once to permanently establish his kingdom.

Why two comings? Why should I believe it? Where in the OT is it said?

We want our spouses to make an informed decision and choose to marry us freely. God wants the same thing - he wants us to choose him freely. 

But the Jews are already married to God! What exactly are we choosing again?

He doesn't establish his kingdom permanently yet (the second coming described by all those prophecies in the list) because he wants to give as many people as possible the chance to make the right choice - but in a way that doesn't force it down their throats.

Then why will Jesus ever come back? Isn't it better to continue giving people the choice? If the second coming will remove the choice, then why have it? Won't it make perfection...less perfect?

And you still haven't established why the prophecies should be fulfilled in the second coming. The messiah isn't the messiah unless he fulfills the prophecies. Doing a vague fulfilling the law thing is not what the messiah is supposed to do.

The first of the non-second coming prophecies in the list:

These are refutations of christian theology, not prophecies.

 Yes, Jesus fulfilled the law

But this doesn't mean anything. The law cannot be "fulfilled." It is something to do in perpetuity, not something to be done once.

but he also said he didn't come to abolish it. He didn't tell anyone they should stop following the law. 

But Paul did. And Christianity has followed his teachings.

He just fulfilled its requirements for all mankind

Again, no such thing. Second, the law never applied to everyone, just to the Children of Israel. 

 It is impossible for humans to keep the law and therefore everyone is judged a sinner and therefore everyone is condemned to die under the law because perfect righteousness cannot abide even the smallest amount of sin.

Woah woah woah. None of these statements follow. Let's go through them one by one.

It is impossible for humans to keep the law

Yes, it is impossible for everyone to be perfect. God knew this when the law was handed down at Sinai, which is why a repentance was established as in option. Coincidentally, we are in the middle of the period devoted to repentance.

therefore everyone is judged a sinner

Everyone has sinned, but everyone can repent. Once you repent, the sin is washed clean.

therefore everyone is condemned to die under the law

One is not condemned to die just because you sin. Lots of people sinned in the Torah, and they didn't immediately die. There are very few sins whose punishment is death.

perfect righteousness cannot abide even the smallest amount of sin

This statement doesn't even make sense. 

So, everyone is condemned to die

Again, doesn't follow.

unless, someone qualified steps up and takes on the punishment.

And even if it did, how is it justice for someone else to take your punishment for you? In fact, you should feel ashamed for allowing someone else to make the sacrifice you weren't able to make yourself.

The one that takes on the punishment has to be human, 

Again, this doesn't make sense. But if it did, why must they be human?

but they also have to be perfect so that they have the right and the qualification to take on the punishment of the imperfect.

Again, why? Even if you would make a substitution for a regular murder, the person who takes it doesn't have to be perfect.

And once the punishment has been meted out

And you think the law is for punishment, and once the punishment is gone the law can be gone? That's an awful view to take for something God given.

 the requirements of the law are fulfilled. But the law is not abolished.

It becomes the same thing. The law we are commanded to keep eternally would no longer be followed.

And then they refute that by saying that God is ONE. But they don't quote any scripture to back that up 

Yes, they do. Duet. 6:4

d I already refuted that claim in the above post - there are many places in the Torah that describe God as both ONE and MORE THAN ONE. The trinity isn't a foreign concept to the scriptures.

It is completely foreign. But that discussion is for another post. 




 What did he do, and how did he get farther than Jesus?

[He almost succeeded](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_Kokhba_revolt) at expelling the Romans, creating a sovereign state, and rebuilding the Temple, returning Israel to it's former glory. Unfortunately, he failed, and that's that.

Prophecies.

Jesus didn't fulfill them.

Resurrection. Healings of the sick and afflicted.

What does these have to do with the Messiah?

 




 Translations are actually rather easy. Look at all the other occurrences, as well as the root word, and see what meaning it could be. You can do it yourself, [here's the link](http://biblehub.com/hebrew/strongs_5959.htm). Look through each of the occurrences. Where can it mean specifically virgin, of which there is already a word in hebrew, as opposed to young woman. 




 Above you. 




 You can think a lot of things. Why do you think this with all the quotes of the Torah going against you? And that doesn't at all disqualify a trinitarian God either if it's all made up?  
























 My mistake, it was a typo. Thanks!

As this is my first build, are there any peripherals I would need which I wouldn't think of? (And on that note, is there a wifi card/adapter you would recommend?  




 I'll get one when I start overclocking in the future. Thank you! 




 Sorry, I'm **not** overclocking, but I might in the future. I have a huge backlog of older games to play before I start on new ones, and I'm not too picky about FPS. I'll save the OC for the future. 




 Thanks for your help! I just bought everything today. I'm hoping to build it over thanksgiving. My final build:

 This is my build. This forum has helped me a lot over the past few weeks, so I'm going to ask one last time before I commit. I am NOT overclocking right now, but I'm leaving it open as option for the future. The parts are all bought, and currently unopened and returnable. Can I change anything to make it better?

 Haven't heard of it before now, and i'm a FE fan. thanks! 




 What is this game? 




 For free? Damn, I missed that. Hopefully it comes up again. 




 Is it worth it to get dragon age at this price, or should I wait? 




 Copy paste is magic!

Isaiah 53 is very clearly talking about the Children of Israel, though it is obscured by the way Christians separated the chapters. If you look at 52: 13-15 (which is the same section that starts with chapter 50), you can see that the prophet introduces a "servant" in third person. 13 says that the servant will be exalted, 14 that (in past tense) "marred beyond man is his appearance," 15 that (in future tense) how kings and nations will react.
Then, in 53:1, the narrative shifts to the perspective of those kings and nations, who are talking about the servant after he has risen and exalted. In the past, "he had not form," "he was despised," etc. But now "He has grown," "he might see offspring," etc. Then in the second half of verse 11 the narrative shift back to prophet, who describes the servant a bit more.

Now how is it possible that, during the time the prophet was speaking, Jesus was already marred, and that nations were appalled (did this ever happen?). Only in the future will the nations say "As one who hid his face from us, he was despised, we held him to no account." Did they ever say this about Jesus? On the other hand, (the house of) Israel fulfills all of this!

In context with chapters 52 and 54, if one is a believer, one could see the prophecy be fulfilled today. If you read the entire section, chapter 53 is actually the pivot between a mourning Israel/Jerusalem and a joyous one, it makes sense why Israel would be referred as a "suffering servant" here.

As for what the prophecies of the Messiah actually are, that was addressed elsewhere. 




 says you, this is not what the person that originally wrote the text believed is it?

Because the punishment for sex before marriage is zero, while adultery's is stoning. Can you give an argument aside from "well that's what you say?"

 there are seven laws to match the seven virtues and seven sins

or maybe the opposite, don't you think?

these of course stem from the seven visible astral bodies common to the ancient religions

Never heard of this. Link please?

again, this is entirely your opinion and not in anyway proven fact, what the author intended is unknown and has been debated often -- you seem to be arguing from the stance that adam and eve really were the first people created and that all humanity stems from them, as you're no doubt aware this view is contentious even within modern Judaism, it's certainly not accepted by secular science.

If we're talking about the author's intent, secular science doesn't matter. If you're disputing my claim about Genesis 9:4, here's the simple proof: The text itself. Adam was given only the plants to eat, while Noah was given the animals (9:3). How is allowing you to eat animals encouraging vegetarianism? Yes, it might say vegetarianism is preferable, but eating meat is certainly allowed -- but eating blood is not.

The reality is...

I have no idea what your point is here, it seems you're just rambling. 

to say you can claim with absolute authority that you know what the author of the commandments intended to convey is just sillyness(sic).

You only have one way of evaluating this, via the text. I get my claims from analysis, not just by "knowing." You want to say I'm wrong, prove me wrong.

uh, it's from the exact bit i was just talking about and how it's clearly actually intended to be a reference to the same thing mentioned in the commandment.

No, grafting is not part of the Noahide law. It is given to Jews, as "don't plant two types of seeds in a field (Lev. 19:19). It has nothing to do with Noah, or animals, or blood.

yes secular law is important because the vague notions hinted at by idealogical theologians as formed into firm sounding aphorisms are entirely meaningless - are you suggesting that the all wise god in his infinite glory decided to troll us with a set of laws with absolutely no use for no reason but to inspire us to craft sensible ones for his followers to oppose on religious grounds? [as the abolution of slavery, womens lib, civil lib and etc, etc, etc have and often still are fought against in the name of the lord?]

You sound like you have a chip on your shoulder. God gave us laws, and the tools with which to create more related to our situations. We are not yet in the Messianic age. 




 brings up the fascinating question of what is a false god, i guess Jesus Christ counts right?

Possibly. It is an argument.

likewise adultery, what does it mean? today we use this to mean clandestine extra-marital sex but it can, and did, mean a much more general thing including sex before marriage.

It means consensual sex when you are engaged or married to another person. Sex before marriage is not adultery.

Seven is the most absurd of course, take an example - are we to say that Martin Luther King for example did not support the rule of law but he did support justice?

Laws between society differ. Just because this is complicated doesn't mean it is absurd. You're way of interpretation isn't necessarily correct, and you're jumping to the worst possible conclusion.

number six of course is kinda bizarre, and lets be honest here you're not kidding anyone - certainly not the all knowing king of kings, if he's still about - but first let's assume your version is how it's intended,

You're not making sense, of course this is what is intended. Why do you think differently?

 doesn't that fact that with only seven slots available one of them is dedicated to something so ridiculous kinda make the whole set look silly

That's only with your incorrect assumption that there are only seven slots. If this law wouldn't be there, there would only be six, and if another one needed to be tacked on, it would be 8. No cosmic force is forcing seven laws over any other number. I'm not going to go into the why of it now.

If this rule ever meant anything it's tied to Genesis 9:4  But flesh with its soul, [which is] its blood, you shall not eat' which is a pretty clear call to if not total vegetarianism at least abstaining from red meat, something likely copied from the other religions of the region and 'updated' in much the way Paul 'updates' foreskins for Christians

You are absolutely wrong. That says that you can't eat the blood of the animal, not to be vegetarian. In fact, Adam and his descendants were originally vegetarians, and only Noah and his descendants were allowed meat after the flood. 

As i'm sure you're aware the traditional Jewish interpretation understands this as being a rule which even forbids the grafting of different species of fruit trees - a method of yield boosting now pretty much default the world over.

Wrong. That is from somewhere entirely different.

as for the others, is piracy theft? or is property theft? what is murder? is war murder? is poverty murder? is self-defence murder? in which case what is self-defence? is forcing your reluctant wife to sleep with you rape?

Good questions! These are things to be ironed out, don't you agree? That is what the rule of law is for.  




 Yeah, I don't have that kind of money to spend. :P do you have a reccomendation for a Z97 mobo under $100? 




 Yes, through the 30th 




 This is my build:

I'm thinking of upgrading the motherboard, since I managed to save money elsewhere, I might want to overclock in the future, and the computer will only be as strong as it's weakest link. 

I'm willing to go to about $650 for the build, which would gives me an extra $80 for the mobo, give or take. Micro Center is having a deal for $40 off a motherboard with a i5-4690k. What can I get that is under $120 on [this list](http://viewer.zmags.com/publication/29c358a7#/29c358a7/33)
of eligible motherboards, that is the best price for performance? I'm not looking for extremely high end, and my preferred price would be $70. What do you think? 




 I have no idea what to look for.  Could you link me to something that will help?  




 Wow, ok. I'm updating from a crappy laptop, so this is amazing. I don't really care about going over 60FPS, as my monitor won't support it; I care more about smooth performance over high graphics anyway. What about some of the newer games, like DA:I?

This is my current build. What will I be able to play with this? Can I play Skyrim on ultra at 60FPS, for example? How about some of the newer games that are just now coming out? Thank you! 




 That case was $65 FOUR days ago. Argh. Other recommendations have been corsair 200R/300R and the NZXT S340. What are your opinions on those?

I'm at the Boston MC, which I think has pretty much everything new in stock. But it seems like all the mAtx sold are actually *more* expensive, so I might go with the ATX instead. There are just so many options that are hard to tell apart. :/ The Z87 boards are a lot cheaper -- would there be a significant drop in performance, or another reason not to get them? I'm looking at [this one](http://www.microcenter.com/product/417392/Z87_PRO3_Socket_LGA_1150_ATX_Intel_Motherboard_-_Refurbished) in particular. 




 The motherboard is part of a microcenter deal of $40 off a cpu and mobo. Motherboards are more complicated than almost anything else, so I'm not exactly sure what I should get. Is there a relatively cheap unlockable mobo? Also, what is better in the long run -- Atx or mAtx?

The case was recommended to me. What is another good budget case that you know of?

 




 Not sold at microcenter, unfortunately. I'm not passing up their $40 off a mobo deal 




 I wanted to keep it under $800 maximum, and preferably closer to $600. Do you know of an overclockable but still inexpensive motherboard?
 




 Ok, how can I make my current build more upgradable? This is what I'm currently getting:

Can I do anything better? 




 I'm not actually going for overclocking, that's just the best deal MC has. Would I *need* a Z97 or else the build won't work, or can the CPU and mobo still work like this? 




 I'm also building something similar for the first time (and on a budget), so here is what I got so far:

I don't need to overclock, but Microcenter is offering a deal for $40 off the motherboard for certain cpu's, so the 4690k saved me $20. Is  this a good budget build? What do you think? 




 My body is ready, but my wallet is empty... 




 What are the differences between all the different types of Motherboards? This is my current, potential-but-not-right-now overclocking build:

As this is my first time building, I want a mid-Tower: Enough space to maneuver in, but also not huge. I don't want to spend too much on the case, and I don't care too much about style. What are my best options? 




 How can you use the OS without using these? 




 For what reason? 




 I'm building a new PC, and I'm not sure which one to get. Both are free. Windows 7 is older, but I've heard nothing but bad news about 8. Which one would you recommend?  




 http://viewer.zmags.com/publication/29c358a7#/29c358a7/33 




 Yeah. Unfortunately my MC doesn't have that mobo in stock. :( 




 That's $70 more, not $30 




 shhhhh, it's a myssssstery. 




 Simple question: What do you do for the best price? Is it better to buy now and on Black Friday, or is it better to wait and get post-Black Friday sales? 




 Should I jump on sales now or wait for after Black Friday? 




 I building the exact same computer as you. Just know that Microcenter currently has a deal for $40 off the motherboard if you buy a 4690k! 




  Obviously there are exceptions to this. And having gender-neutral bathrooms shouldn't involve the removal of urinals. But why not just have one big fucking bathroom with all the stalls and urinals?

Maybe because some people are uncomfortable with it, and they would rather only have people of the same sex in the bathroom? Especially when the bathroom includes showers, for example? Should these be denied a comfortable space? 




 Yeah, I saw that. I JUST ordered the 600W one yesterday, so I'm seeing if I can cancel it. I'm going to micro center soon to pick up the last parts so I'll hopefully build it sometime next week. I can't wait to actually play games decently; and not just decently, but good.

Good luck with yours!

Looks like you're overclocking and I'm not, otherwise these are pretty much the same. I'm also thinking about switching the PSU, and I got a cheaper RAM deal. It's reassuring that we have the same build, it means I probably didn't screw up! 




 Are you me? I'm doing the exact same thing, except my laptop is four years old. want to compare? 




 This is incorrect. The hebrew word in the texts of Isaiah could be understand as either maiden or virgin but the Greek word used in the New Testament has no such ambiguity. It only means virgin. The writers of the New Testament understood the words of Isaiah to mean "virgin" and that is why the Greek word for virgin is used and not the Greek word for "maiden".

This is one of the most conceited things I have ever heard. You think your translation, written hundreds of years later, is better than the original text?
 




 I'm getting i5 4590k, and it's the first time building a computer. Thanks for the chance! 




 Currently, there is a 2TB Hybrid SSD on sale for $80 on amazon. What are the advantages and disadvantages of a hybrid vs. a HDD or regular SDD? 




 If I want to spend $50-70, what is the best one to get? 




 Is the tomb raider bundle worth it? I've never played a tomb raider game before. 




 Right now it's $130 on newegg. How does it compare to the one I'm getting? 




 Ow well. This is the first time building a computer anyway, so take my advice with a grain of salt. 




 If you have access to microcenter, I have a very good and cheap build I'm making. Take a look at my history. 









 It's called both, depending on who you're talking to.

My laptop was expensive in 2010, but probably the most expensive piece of junk for gaming you could buy. I got sick of barely even being able to play Morrowind, so I decided to finally get off my ass and do something about it.

I don't know much about building, so I looked for the cheapest prices for the best components. I really only need games to run on high at 30 FPS, but I would like this to last for some years. I think I got some pretty good deals for that. What do you think? Anything I should change? 




 Switched, thank you. 




 I took the SSD because it seemed really cheap for the amount of storage, and the 128GB isn't that much less expensive. 
 
Thanks for the ram tip.

I'm not sold on any of this -- if you have a better idea, let me know! This is my first time building, so I've been a little bit lost the last couple of days. Anything I should change? I'm trying to build a gaming pc which will run new games smoothly on high/ultra for the next 4-5 years (I'm fine going to 30FPS). Anything else I should look at? Are there better deals? Thank you! 




 The non-k series is actually more expensive right now oddly enough 




 I'm not; I'm only getting a such good cpu and graphics card because they're so cheap for the power, and they will last a long time. 
 




 The SSD is $20 off at microcenter, and I might wait for a sale on a different 1TB hard drive. Do all the parts fit together, and will I need anything else? I have a monitor, OS, etc. already.

 Ah, drat, you seem to be right. And the dell forums said no other boards will fit. :( I'll take it apart to check anyway, but it looks like a new case is in order. 




 How do I do that? 




 Great explanation, thank you. I'll make my list and check back to buildapc when it's finished to make sure all the parts are good. 




 Alright, I'll open up the case tomorrow and poke around. 

Another noob question, if you don't mind: I'm finding lots of differently priced options for video cards. For example, the Radeon R9 280: [This](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00J7YFUPA/?tag=pcpapi-20) vs. [this](http://www.amazon.com/Sapphire-Radeon-PCI-Express-Graphics-11230-00-20G/dp/B00IZXOW80/? tag=bom-tomshardware-20). Are there significant differences, or should I just get the cheapest? 




 Thank you! Is there any reason not to get a better graphics card? I'm looking at the Radeon R9 280, for example, which is currently $140 




 Thank you. What does OEM mean?

This one is 17" long, 7.5" wide, and 16" tall. Is this standard? 




 Thank you! 




 I haven't had any pride for years!

I'm new at this, and I'm going for a relatively cheap build. What are the advantages of getting a new case? 




 No, I'm cheap. :P But seriously, are there any technical reasons not to use an old case? 




 I have an old case from around 10 years ago, which originally ran windows vista. It is a mid-tower. Is there any reason not to use it and instead get a new one?

[Link to the exact case.](http://www.pcworld.com/product/29437/dell-dimension-e521.html)

Thanks! 




 Is there any reason not to use an older case? I have one from about 10 years ago, and would use it if I could. ([Link to case](http://www.pcworld.com/product/29437/dell-dimension-e521.html)) 




 Thanks! I'm not even sure what I'm even buying yet, but this seemed the right price for a good card. I just wanted to make sure that this wasn't a steal.  




 Is it worth it to buy the video card right now? That is a large price off. 




 But that is not what the maps show... 




 He needs therapy, today.  




 And by "we", the jews mean "dead members of our ~~religion~~ tribe about 3500 years ago, which we know because ~~it's written in a book~~ our ancestors told it to their children, who told it to their children, and which is written down in a book we've been passing down for all of those generations that we read in its original language".

Whereas when the mormons say "they", it means "dead members of ~~our religion~~ a random tribe from 2500 years ago, which we know because it's written in ~~a book~~ some random text who this one person translated".

 




 Because the Mormons say that "they mass witnessed something," while Jews say "**we** mass witnessed something." 




 Wikipedia! But what does that have to do with this discussion? 




 **What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.**

Gaming, programming, Internet and watching movies. I'm not too picky about graphics; I just need something like Skyrim, for example to run on high at around 30 FPS. I'm more interested in smooth graphics than impressive ones.

**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** 

$600-800

**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** 

Anytime in the next two months, when the best deals will be.

**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc)** 

Everything aside from the OS, monitor, keyboard, and mouse.

**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** 

Massachusetts, and yes.

**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.** 

Probably just older ones from around the house. Would this be a problem?

**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** 

No, probably not.

**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**

I would want a decent amount of storage so that I don't have to worry about it anytime soon, but that is all.

**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**

No.

**Do you need a copy of Windows 7 or 8.1 included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference for one or the other?**

No, but is there a preference for one or the other?

**Extra info or particulars:**

I'm just sick of having a bad laptop and want something decent, and that will be able to last at least a couple of years. (I can barely play Morrowind right now.) Thank you! 




 Open up the book and see what it says

"This says my ancestors all stood at this mountain and listened to a god. I asked my dad and said he never heard of it. Why should I listen to you?"  




 No, the difference is that eternity will eventually answer. 




 The Palestinians are saying it is tainted by prayer, not us. 




 Yom Kippur is just a day of concentrated repentance, and only for sins between man and God. 

[This](http://www.myjewishlearning.com/holidays/Jewish_Holidays/Yom_Kippur/In_the_Community/Prayer_Services/Confession/Confessing_Sins/Connecting_Sin_and_Repentance.shtml?p=0) is a short primer on repentance in Judaism, and [here](http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/story/repentance) is a deeper look into the subject. 

 




 Just google either. There is only a slight difference but I appreciate your need to be pedantic to attempt to prove your point.

Hey, you asked, I answered. It is definitely ethnic cleansing.

In any case, Israel has been a bad neighbor, they have no one to blame for any bad feelings towards them in the region but themselves.

Really? You think Israel is to blame for all the wars it has fought? 

What about Ethiopian Jews?

Originally from the Levant. And even if they weren't, people can be adopted into the tribe. 




 Fan fiction.  




 Nope, not at all. Why are you equating the fruit to all sin? There are specific punishments for specific sins, and specific ways to repent for specific sins. If every sin caused death, we would all be dead long ago.

Life is about improving yourself, not about dying. 




 The price to pay for sinning is dying.

But this is not true. 




 ~~telling~~ toeing the line

FTFY

 




 Ethnic cleansing and genocide are two distinct crimes, though they are often wrongly conflated by people who like throwing out buzzwords. And Jews are an ethnic group who share the religion Judaism. 




 They are also a bit of a far cry from voting on whether or not Jews should be ethnically cleansed from the region.

What do you think "return to their home countries" mean aside from ethnic cleansing? 




 Not Judaism! 




 To get your edit out of the way first, you cannot directly cause an action which is intended to give you a benefit that breaks Shabbat. It gets complicated, but this definitely falls under forbidden.

To me, yes, it is entirely indisputable that igniting a gas by way of a spark is the same thing as lighting a fire. Do you have an argument to how it is different? 




 Because then you would know that lighting a fire, especially in regards to a car, is not a more complicated subject. Yes, there are always deeper layers, but this is not one of them. 




 So why don't you learn the sources instead of criticizing it? 




 Yes, and everyone will agree with you (I hope). But to some, observing Judaism (the active part of being Jewish) is taking that commitment. 




 Not really, there is a reason it is its own movement and not a sub group. But, even so, what's your point? 




 Not true. If you want to say it is similar in principle, you have to prove it from the theology. 




 Just because it was formed out of Reform, does not mean it is comparable to reform. 




 I do not, personally, try to live my life in order to "fit in" with Christian society.

He didn't say that, just that it was originally founded to fit in more with Christian society, which is pretty much indisputable. Reform has changed quite a lot in the past 150 years.

In addition, you are kind of are admitting it. You are just using "modern" instead of Christian, but it has the same connotation: the mitzvot, as enumerated by the rabbis, are not something you want to totally incorporate into your life. That's fine, but it is not the same thing as Judaism was before.
 




 A 50 year ceasefire does not mean "Openly at war" still. You sound like one of the idiots that thinks North Korea and America are suddenly just going to start shooting each other at the drop of a hat.

Do you not follow the news? That border, though quiet, has been seen a number of attacks since the last ceasefire. Israel can and will bomb Syria at the drop of a hat if it feels threatened, like transfers of long range missiles to Hezbollah.

Israel helping ISIS and other rebel groups though this conflict by bombing SAA bases has just further destabilized this conflict, 

Israel has only bombed in two situations: In the case of a threat like above, or if any fire lands on Israel's side of the border. If they were bombing bases like America, you would hear about it. 




 You think Israel and Syria aren't at war? Wow. 




 Yes, and they have been at war for decades. 




 tell me, how is it racist? 




 is that supposed to be a bad thing? 




 There been a lot tension in Jerusalem with the Al-Aqsa Mosque and settlement.

What exactly is your view of what is happening there? 




 They will if they ever get control. 




  Something happened to cause multitudes of people to change their faiths from Judaism to Christianity against the establishment,

This didn't happen, unless by multitudes you mean "dozens." Almost all of the converts were Roman, not Jewish. 




 Is there any way to corroborate this? Right now all there is as evidence is one unsourced comment on the article. 
























 And all the other points? I would like to know where you got your facts from.  




 What's your source on the north having more slaves? The other guy already spoke about NJ, so what are the other states that didn't give up their slaves? If you say MD or KY, remember that they were already under marshal law. 

we were fighting to keep North troops out of our homes because they were actively making grabs for our land.

What land were northern troops grabbing before secession?

There was also the issues of state rights

What about State's rights? 

massive taxes that were slowly driving us into crippling poverty

What taxes are these? Are you referring to the shipping tariffs? 

Yes,  Sherman's March was devastating. But do you have a source for the rapes, murders, and burning people alive? 

There were no saints on either side, but that doesn't mean the south was fighting for the right thing?  









 Well, it is if you're talking about The Stormlight Archive. In the real world though... 




 No silly that's the other guy. 




 I am a stick! 




 Can you translate the first sentence of Genesis for me? 




 5'9. My dad is 6', and my mom is 5'. I guess I'm lucky I'm not shorter. 




 Nope, gap year before college. 18-19. 




 Not eligible because I was on a gap year trip. Change it to let me in and I would sign right up! 




 If that was the primary grievance, why did the disengagement from Gaza lead to more conflict? 




 How about Jews have the right of return to Israel, and Palestinians have the right of return to Palestine? Is that such a difficult concept?
 




 It comes from a coding behavior, where the asterisk can stand for anything. For example, searching "re\*" will give you any word that begins with "re", like red, read, reddit, or redemption. So searching "trans\*" gives you trans, transperson, transman, transwoman, etc. It has evolved to mean any permutation of the word trans so they don't all have to be mentioned. 




  And strange considering a nation which did not allow its people to freely leave the nation allowed Jews to leave by the hundreds of thousands from 1948-1980s.

OMG, do you actually believe this? Rofl. There was a massive Jewish migration to Israel after the collapse of the soviet union even though they are allowed to leave the whole time? You might type well, but you're still crazy. 




 You misunderstood what I was saying.

I don't think I did, considering your next sentences. 

The Messiah is (sic) perfect

No, he will not be.

Humans are not perfect. 

Very true. And the Messiah will be human.

 The Messiah would have been able to follow the OT laws perfectly.

Nope, as I said, the Messiah will be human, no need to be perfect. 

Of course Jews still follow those laws, but the entire point of the OT was what?

To teach us, of course. After all it is called the Teaching.

They also don't believe in Jesus. That is a concept which is part of the entire point of Christianity.

No, Judaism, is not Christianity - Jesus. The theology, even just about the Messiah, is very, very different.


 




 The laws of the OT were so impossible for human beings to follow, they were meant for a perfect being; The Messiah (as Christians and Jews see it)

No, Jews do not believe this. The laws are for all Jews. 




 The first fruits 




 No, read the text carefully. Able gave up the *first* of his flock, while Cain gave of the fruits of the ground. There is a specific herbrew word for first fruits, bikurim, that is not used. Sacrifices are supposed to be from what you can produce, but what does it say about a gift when you don't give it from your best? 




 Because this wasn't about meat vs. veggies, it is about the best vs. the mediocre. Able gave his best, Cain gave his regular stuff. Which would you regard as a better gift?
 




 This is because Judaism/Jews predate the modern separation between religion and ethnicity. The best way to think about Judaism is that it is a set of laws for a tribe, the Jewish people. The tribe got dispersed and carried their rules with them. You are part of the tribe if you were born into it by its rules, or you gain nationality by becoming a citizen - in modern times, convert.  Does that make sense? 

Now for your other points:    

They still are Jewish. Someone can be Jewish, no practicing, or even having rejected the religion and their family lineage is not traced back to eastern Europe, or it's a weak connection which normally wouldn't be used to identify race. It doesn't make sense. 

First, Jews trace lineage back to the expulsion from Israel, not to eastern Europe. Only a subset of Jews, Ashkenazim, are from Eastern Europe.

Second, the connection isn't so much used to identify race as your national/tribal affiliation. Think of it like this: Once you gain American citizenship, all your children are American citizens no matter where they are born. All their children, your grandchildren, are American even if they never enter America. Now just have the extra step that it must be your mother, not any American, and you've got a rough equivalency.

I just don't get how if I marry a jewish girl who's father is a north African Jew, mother is christian Caucasian. We get married and ignore all religion. Our kids would be Jewish?

See the nationality explanation above. The only difference is that for your kids to be American you have to register their birth an the embassy, but for Judaism is automatic. (Minor point: She would not be Jewish by traditional Jewish laws, so many Jews would not think she was Jewish and therefore her children would not be either.)

What is your thoughts on people saying something negative towards Israel as, 'Those Israeli...?'

It's as good (bad) as any other prejudice is. The problem is that many people say this to cover up anti-Semitism, and you only have to prod an inch for it to come out. It makes Jews assume that its not said with good intentions. 




 Exactly the title. I followed the guide for step: extended, and tried to do everything exactly as they said. But whenever I boot up skyrim try to load and old save or start a new game, I immediately get a CTD. Any ideas?

Edit: [Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LspA1T2d8ZYBY7LIcJA5VGPjrpk9bRx8aQZsFFhBtEg/edit?usp=sharing) is the Papyrus log. I'm sure something went wrong, I just don't know what.  




 Honestly, she sounds contrite and probably means well, but she doesn't deserve you. She doing this just to relieve her own guilt, not for you at all. Never talk to her again.

On the other hand, do remember that you weren't exactly being played, and that the person you were talking to was probably real, even though the pictures of her were not.  Take the lessons you learned over the years and apply them to the other things in your life. Good luck! 




 No, it would not at all, as evidenced by Deutoronomy 18. 




 while putting zero effort in understanding the fact that blood sacrifice is a huge part of the atonement of sin for the Jews

Because it is not true. 




 In Judaism, if their prophecy doesn't come to pass.

If their *positive* prophecy didn't come to pass. A negative prophecy can be averted by repentance, which is why all those you mentioned are still considered prophets. 




 1. Wikipedia: People accuse Israel of the motive, but no evidence.
2. RT: 3 buildings were destroyed for a reason unspecified. No buildings have been built there before or since. Includes a blatant lie: "All previous destruction of Palestinian homes in the E1 zone has resulted in Israeli settlement construction." There is no Israeli settlement construction in E1.
3. A bunch of links; only one mentions this topic. It is an Haaretz editorial, which only says this behavior is "historic." Again no examples.
4. A video containing a 30 second clip stating that farms are being "bulldozed by settlers to build illegal settlements," No sources, no details, wrong information. (Settlers don't have bulldozers, the army does.) And Press.Tv is not a trustworthy source, IMO. 
5. Israel bulldozing illegal West Bank settlements

Look, I think the current settlement policy is a horrible idea and wish there was a change of leadership in the Israeli government. But opposition should be based on truth, not lies. 




 Of course. As I said, Rashi is not commenting on the preposition, but the mention of first of the flock, but not first of the fruit. 




 Not me, but he emphasized it to show that is says "of" not "first of." That is the distinction. 




 Because giving a gift that is not your best shows that you don't value the person you're giving to. The same principle applies to sacrifices to God. 




 What? One says first and one does not, it has nothing to do with the preposition. That is what Rashi comments on. 




 Name one time a Palestinian house was bulldozed so that a settler can build on it. 




 Because ISIS is nowhere near the border with syria. 




 It is downloadable only, there is no way to transfer it. 




 Pre-zoloft: Yes

Post-zoloft: No. Unless I haven't done so for a week or more.  




 Yes, they should. But in the views of some, France does not.  




 Wouldnt be so bad if the settlements were on empty land.

They are.  




 False. It was better than Christian Europe, sure, but nothing like without persecution. 




 Over 150,000 Palestinians have been forced out of Area C over the years

Source?  




 Certainly it has significance. The polytheist/Atheist would make a similar cry against claims of monotheism as a way to box you in from using your own text and history to explain/define what you beleive about God. 

What?

No. You don't have to accept what is written with respect to Christianity as true but to reject it out of hand as part of the argument itself is disingenuous. Like the Moslem, you a Jew can claim it has been corrupted or misinterpreted/manipulated. 

I am not claiming this. You are claiming as proof that Jesus forgiving sins means he is God. I am saying that the only thing we know is that Jesus **says** he forgive sins. Unlike everything else in the NT, this is something he said, not something he did. Therefore, this is not a proof.

Because the Op self identifies as a Moslem and that was how my response begin. Jews clearly make different arguments. 

Looks like we pretty much make the same argument here...
 




 It has no significance because it is the central claim that is being disputed. 

Others : Jesus is not God!

You: But what about healing others, mastering nature, forgiving sins and raising from the dead? [This shows he is God!]

Others: Many other prophets healed others, mastered nature, said God forgave sins and raised from the dead. These do not make Jesus unique. 

You: But Jesus forgave sins of people directly, showing he is God!

Others: That is the claim that the NT is making, and is tautological. For Jesus to forgive sins, he must be God. The only proof we have of this, even through the NT itself, is Jesus saying so. Claiming to forgive sins does not make Jesus unique.

Make sense?

He also is reported to have said others after will do these and much greater things (JN 14:12) so not being unique isn't the significant qualifier.

Ok, then why did you say that these acts are ignored? And even so, we're talking about people **before,** not after.
 




 The only two ways we'll ever get it is if God reveals it directly or we build a time machine. Neither seem likely anytime soon, but we can hope! 




 Huh? He's not trying to prove that this happened, just that it is not shifting the goalposts like you claimed. 




 You're just going back to Jesus is God again. The things the NT claimed he did were done by all the other prophets and did not make him unique, aside from him saying that he is God.  




 Elijah and Elisha. Go through their stories, they are pretty interesting. Note that they did not "claim to forgive sin," but claimed that "one's sins were forgiven by God." Subtle difference. 




 It doesn't. It is an argument against your disproof.  




 Yeah, fan-fiction is usually substandard and bastardizes the original material. Shouldn't be surprising. 




 C.E. and B.C.E. were first used extensively by Jews in order to reference the Gregorian calendar without having to reference Jesus. The argument over whether it is "our lord" or "the lord" is ultimately irrelevant, since both are a direct contradiction of Judaism. Taking your title literally, do you believe Jews should not use C.E. and B.C.E in their own writings and lessons? 




 You could not say the same about God, because God by definition has always existed (YHVH probably means something like The Eternal) and exists outside of what He created (see the Kabbalistic take on the creation story). Therefore, God can be excluded as per-existent, and the waters cannot  




 Rashi is saying that if you're taking it literally, you must think that the first sentence reads "In the beginning of [all]" with the all omitted. But if it was the beginning of everything, there could not have already been water! Therefore, the sentence does not have an all and indicates that the story is not literal. 




 Which ones? 




 Then why didn't they make peace before there were any settlements? 




 So as long as the soldiers don't bear your insignia, then you're not attacking anyone? I bet you think that Russia wasn't "engaging in war" in eastern Ukrain either. 




 They are quite open to inspection

Hahahahaha 




 The Palestinians, whose only real crime is to live in the occupied territories and got caught in the middle of it all, bear little responsibility for those wars,

Look up [Haj Amin Al-Husseini](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haj_Amin_al-Husseini) and then say that again with a straight face. 




 Arming Hezbollah and Hamas and encouraging them to use those weapons are not "causing a war"?

 




 I can't decide whether you're serious, in which case you know so little you shouldn't be commenting on this, or not, in which case I have no idea what you're trying to say.

If it's the former: The tunnels made are built by Hamas dozens of feet underground, lined by cement to hold them up, and take months to dig. The exits are only dug just as fighters are exiting to make sure that it is not found. And you think these are tunnels for the poor workers who want to work in Israel? Just FYI 




 What exactly do you think tunnels into Israel are for? There are no checkpoints on that border, but border crossings, like for two separate countries.  




 You must have a really bad spanish teacher, the o and a mean male and female should be one of the first things you learn. 




 No reason as to why... I'll message the mods. anyway, here was the full post: 

Edit: It's been approved, yay!


 




 Again, this is especially not helpful for the bar/club question.

I think this thread was deleted, because it is not showing up on new...oh well. 




 Of course there isn't one magical way, but we don't want to come across too strongly or be an asshole, so "just take a risk" or "put yourself out there" isn't helpful. This advice is how we get in the "friendzone" or going home without a date in the first place. How do you do it?  




 There have been a couple of threads up on how we do act. We all know that neither the RedPill approach or the Nice Guy approach is the right one, but we don't know *how* to show interest without being seen as creepy or aggressive. So here's the thread where you give us all advice! What is the difference between aggressive and confident? How do you hit on people without being a PUA? What are the signals that tell you that the girl wants you to go further or to stop?

We know a lot about what not to do, but what **can** we do?

Here are some specific questions, and I'm sure that some other shy guys have more!

Situation: Bar or club

1. I see someone attractive that I want to hit on. What are ways to show interest? What is a good way to start a conversation? I've seen ways that seem rude (getting in their body space, bumping into them on purpose and then introducing yourself, etc.), but is there a positive way of getting and maintaining attention?
  
2. While dancing, how to start dancing with someone without breaking boundaries they might have? I have heard girls complain more than once about guys getting to touchy, and I've seen girls willingly start to grind immediately. How to tell the difference?

Situation: A friend 

1. I have a friend or a close friend that I am developing feelings for or am already interested in. I have no idea whether they like me back. How do I convey this without being too creepy or violating boundaries? What level of touching is ok before having an explicit conversation? 

2. I have a friend or a close friend that I am developing feelings for or am already interested in, and I think they are returning my feelings. What are the appropriate steps to take? What is a good way to bring it up, and what is a good way to back out if I'm wrong?

Situation: An acquaintance or passerby

1. I see someone on public transport, on the street, a diner, etc. Is there any way to approach without being a creep? There's more than one article or thread we've read that women don't like being seen as sex objects everywhere they go, so this is a fine line to walk.

2. I have a distant crush on someone I see fairly regularly, like class or work. We might say hi once in a while. What is a good way to approach for the first time? Is it better to try being a friends first, or to ask immediately for a date? 

I'll add anymore if people give me some!

One last thing: We don't want to be Nice Guys, but we're shy because we don't want to be like the assholes we see and that our female friends complain about. We are invested in our identity of being the nice, responsible person, and we don't necessarily want to change that outside of being less shy. As the threads on /r/AskMen have shown, the messages being sent by both society and people around us are confusing, to say the least. We want to be a nice person as well as get hookups/dates/relationships, depending on the individual, but not be creeps. 

Please share your general advice as well as for the situations I described above!

 Because this puts the final nail in the coffin of a negotiated solution while Abbas is head of the PA, and also probably drives the Israeli electorate to the right for the upcoming elections. 




 The the ~~Joooooos~~I mean the Israelis! 




 So Jews had the right, in 1948, to make a country wherever they wanted? Good to know! 




 Please stop having so much money 




 The actual story is probably that Jesus was a normal baby, and the virgin part was made up so it would appeal to the people of pagan religions when Christianity began to spread. 




 I'll add this to my list of bad Christian prophecies. I already have two and nobody ever takes me up on them to argue. :( 




 Google is this decade's Bell-At T. It just sells off all your info instead of price gouging you! 




 Oh lordy, here we go again.

The prophecies:

Correct: 3 (but see disputations about genealogy) 

Any Jew, only prophetic in a general sense: 2

About the Messiah but Misinterpreted: 4

Not a prophecy: 5

Not about the Messiah: 1, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 21, 26, 27, 28, 29

Psalms: 6, 9, 13, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26 

Psalms is not prophetic, it is very nice poetry. You can try and prove otherwise, if you want to try...

Malachi 3:1 - Probably not about the Messiah, and even if it is, their interpretation is nonsensical.

Daniel 9 - This is not about the Messiah. [See here.](http://jewsforjudaism.org/knowledge/articles/counter-missionary-2/texts/daniel-9-a-true-biblical-interpretation/)

10 points - These are all pretty stupid post hoc connections. They are not "foreshadowing" of any kind.

Please, even for Christians there are better arguments than these... 




 The problem is that standardized testing has been shown to favor the rich. 




 Pray tell, what exactly did that piece of information show you?  




 Christianity is not the same as all theism. Yes, it has a lot of contradictions, but why don't you look at the other options instead of throwing everything out?

Do you really not know why having higher average temperatures will be harmful? 




 It's because you're not reading the 800 year old text correctly or in context.

 Mmmmm. does that fedora fit snugly on your head?  




 Through much of 2008, Israeli and Syrian diplomats discussedwith the assistance of Turkeyterms for ending the state of war that has existed between them since 1948. 

In the [first source](http://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/resources/mappingpeace.pdf) quoted in wikipedia. Your move. 




 Before I even get to your argument, what does anything have to do with Syria? 




 In historical terms, Israel and Syria have been in a state of war since 1948

[Source](http://www.ecfr.eu/article/commentary_syria_the_view_from_israel141). I just picked one off Google, there are a lot more. **You are wrong.** 




 I can concede this logic is sound, but I don't think that this would be done unless another goal was achieved as well. Otherwise it is politically too risky. 




 why does Israel has the right to break the air space of another country, to draw bombs on it infrastructures and move out

**Because they are at war, and the IDF is attacking military targets.** How long will it take to get this through your head? This is what happens in war. If they don't want this to happen, they should finally make peace.

When Hamas send it rockets from Gaza with almost zero casualties, Israel destroyed whole gaza and killed thousands, Oh yeah I forgot that was totaly self defense....

Because civilians were under attack, and one of the primary purpose of a state is to defend it's residents. Again Syria is totally allowed to attack Israel military bases (not civilians like they did in previous wars), but they know they will be utterly crushed. 




  Israel is not at war with Syria the last time I checked. 

You are wrong. 




 Since the 70's? Since Israel was founded. 




 Since when is attacking a military target of a country you're at war with illegal?

Of course there would be a reaction! Syria can react however they want, but they know any further provocations would result in a crushing defeat. 




 Because every other country would hit civilian areas and kill people. No casualties have been reported. 




 He might be an asshole, but he is also correct. 




 But it doesn't make sense to destroy air defense in a targeted airstrike, because Israel gets around the anti-air batteries in different ways. Assad will just replace the S-300s. 




 Israel and Syria have been at war for *over 60 years.* Why the fuck do you think that this has anything to do with ISIS? 




 And what evidence do you have for that? 




 Of course not. There are two targeted strikes, probably aimed at weapons for Hezbollah, and that's it. 




 Did the person you applied to say anything about right or wrong? I think you have preconceived opinions that you're pushing on others. 




 Knowing the IAF, it probably didn't happen. If it did the IDF will tell the Israeli public sometime today. 




 Because anti-Assad = pro-Isis! I forgot that the world was black and white, thanks for reminding me. 




 Two boxes and two people. So much cooperation.

Why is this news again? 




 PC and Wii U all the way 




 It's about Jerusalem being restored. I don't see what is so complicated here... 




 No, but I would like to :P 




 Thanks! do you have a link to that? 




 Oh well, thanks anyway. 




 Damn,  I didn't think of that.  Do you know of any good cheaper ones?  




 I have the s340. Is there any way to install an optical drive?  




 oooo, I get it now, especially since I read the motherboard manual. I put the psu in, and the rest will be tomorrow!
 




  don't forget to install the if shield

Now I'm nervous, and I can't find anything on google. You're probably making a joke...at least I hope so!

I'll post pictures when I finish! 
























 Another thing: I don't think we can demand better moderation of the forums, since the nastiness was all over. 




 I have know idea who/what Vizard is, probably because I'm not involved enough in the community. 

Are there any key points you want to extract from the interview since it might not be published? 




 Good to know, thanks. 




 Added.

Donations where 100% goes to the author may not even happen.

They might add a donate button if we push hard enough. That's why I'm advocating for a paid mods being a guaranteed certain level of quality by the developer so it is differentiated from donations. 




 That thing is an eyesore to read. Who was the interview with? 




 [Link to skyrimmods post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/343ym0/paid_mods_are_coming_whether_we_like_it_or_not/)

I'm new to the modding community, which means I only started playing Morrowind a year ago and Skyrim over the last six months. But like people have been saying a lot, recent events have inspired me to give back. As I have next to no money and not enough time to learn to mod extensively (even though I played around with it a bit in Morrowind), I was thinking about what's going to happen in the future. I realized two things:

1. Paid mods are coming, no matter how much we protest. The Valve press release was pretty clear about that. 
2. Next time around, there won't be a community uproar at nearly the same scale. The Skyrim modding community is the biggest we have, another one won't be established by the time the next game is released. We can't stop the hundreds of thousands from buying the next Bethseda game, even if it is announced with paid mods. 

Since we can't stop paid mods arriving, I think the best solution is to preemptively speak as a community to Valve and Bethesda about what we *do* want. Reading around the forums, I've noticed most people don't have a problem with paid mods **in theory**, as long as several key conditions are met. However, the implementation this time around was abysmal and we all realized nothing but slow (or not so slow) decline of mods would come from it. 

So I have a radical idea. I think we should compile a list of the many sins that were committed, the problems they would cause, and improvements that would need to occur next time. We can present these to Valve/Bethesda as demands for the community to reluctantly support, or at least not condemn, paid mods. By conditioning our support on several key demands, we can make sure Valve sets up a marketplace that does not set off the disastrous effects we fear. Both parties would benefit: Since we can't stop paid mods, we could turn them into something which will have neutral or maybe even beneficial effects. Bethesda won't get the inevitable PR hit next time around, which is fresh in their minds right now and so holds the most power.

I've started small list below, and I think it would be great for the community to put together a comprehensive list and make it as official as possible. Hopefully this will be an opportunity to bring us together after the recent bitterness.

Here's my start, from what I've seen people saying. 

Issues:

1. The way the marketplace was set up encouraged crap shovelware micro transactions over good mods.
2. There is no good way to test a mod and return it if it doesn't work.
3. There is no way to make sure that the modder will continue supporting the mod through main game updates and other mod changes. 
4. Mods use one another assets all the time, which makes monetizing them a legal quagmire. In addtion, relying on modders and the community to police stolen assets in unworkable.
5. The paltry 25% the modders got was absolutely ridiculous.
6. The secrecy of the implementation runs counter to how the modding community functions.
7. Most of us using mods don't use the Workshop because of its limited functionality, meaning we can't access the mods posted like SkyUI 5.0.

Solutions: 

**Quality**

/u/DiamondMind: A paid mod being on the marketplace means that the developer has endorsed it as unofficial DLC for the game and guarantee it. This legitimizes the cut they take and gives them a stake to supervise which mods have their name attached. 

/u/DavidJCobb: All mods must have a seven day return policy, no questions asked and no consequences.

**User convenience**

/u/DavidJCobb: Load order managers and mod managers are essential to using mods while keeping one's game stable, but Skyrim doesn't natively support these tools, and the average Steam user won't know much about them. This is quite possibly the largest barrier to modding. Bethesda must develop their own analogues to LOOT and MO/NMM, and integrate these directly into the PC versions of FO4 and TES6.

Authors should be permitted to upload full archives, rather than a BSA/ESP pairing (the current limitation), but the uploading of loose files should be discouraged, and some sort of warning should be indicated to the user in the Steam Workshop's UI.

/u/DiamondMind: Do not tie downloads into the workshop; allow them to be used like Nexus files. That way, Bethesda and other developers do not need to create their own tool and force us all to use it. 

**Compensation**

Modders need to get at least 50% of the sale. Valve and the publisher can work out how to split the other 50% on their own. There are more than enough differences between mods and other "industry practices" to allow this.

/u/NeuroticNyx: A donation button on unpaid mods on the Steam Workshop.

/u/MaryMudpie: A clearer system of Pay-As-You-Go for paid mods. For example, all prices are listed as "Recommended: $xx" on the main page and has a "Minimum: $xx" on the mod's individual page as well.


**Limitations on sale**

/u/DavidJCobb Mod authors should not be permitted to sell bugfixes for base game content, official DLC, or any other mods. These must be free. Obviously this policy must be worded in such a manner as to permit a mod author to continue selling a mod even if they must later release a bugfix for it; yet to forbid that author from releasing the bugfix itself as a separate paid product.

/u/DiamondMind: UI and other "fixes," not just bugs, should also never be sold.

**Theft**

If a mod author's resources are stolen and used in a paid mod, that author should be able to report that to Valve and have it acted on promptly. The thief's revenue should be transferred to the original author; or, if the author doesn't have payment details registered with Steam, the full amount should be held in escrow indefinitely, without a time limit, until it can be transferred to the original author.

In particular, we need assurances that Valve will pay attention to content that was originally uploaded to other sites, or at least to the more notable ones, when investigating theft reports. The full details of their policies regarding theft should be made public.

**Transparency**

Speak to us every step of the way, and release a prototype version first that we can check for issues.


This is of course unfinished, and there a lot more problems to address. Comment and I'll add it to the list!
 




 Still won't work for paid mods, but I'll add it in another section. 




 I agree that Nexus should be more strongly pushing donations for the modders, and maybe take a 5% cut to keep the site running. (Seems like they're already doing it. If you download a mod, you get a donation pop up) However, this will NOT be a counter to payed mods, because as much as we want it differently only a fraction of people would donate, and Steam would look more attractive for the guaranteed money. So though I think Nexus' improvements are part of the solution, we have to work with Steam as well.

The reason I think it should go through the Nexus is because many of the most popular mods are improvements on the bugginess or lack of quality of the vanilla game. Bethesda should not be rewarded with revenue from the sale of SkyUI 5.0 after they did such a piss poor job with the original UI and didn't even bother to update it in a patch. They should not get money from a mod like CWO (not that Apollo would sell it, of course) that reintroduces content that was cut.

See my discussion with /u/DavidJCobb about what should and should not be allowed to be sold. I agree with you, but it is a grey area. 




 Best list I've found yet! I linked you in [my topic here](http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/343ym0/paid_mods_are_coming_whether_we_like_it_or_not/), since I'm doing something complementary to you. Maybe you should make your own topic again?

A couple more points: The actual mods given were mostly shitty (see /u/lolzergrush above) and the secrecy surrounding it runs counter to the modding community. 




 Unfortunately, with how often skyrim can crash, that is pretty much during play. :P 




 That would be wonderful, but I don't think it's going to happen, unfortunately.  




 Yep, but we're working with what is possible, not ideal. Still, added. 




 Unfortunately, I don't think there is any way to enforce that. 




 That's an understandable concern. Good on you for discussing it calmly, and rationally.

That's why I didn't post about this over the last few days. Now that everyone's emotions have calmed down somewhat, we can get something positive done.

My concerns are the inverse image of yours: if we decide that something along the lines of SkyUI shouldn't be permitted for sale, whatever logic we use to justify that can inevitably be used for just about any other game mechanic. If the community thinks that TES6's combat design is horribly lacking, will it suddenly push to deprive combat modders of their right to sell? Would that be fair to those modders?

Yes, there would need to be some clear definitions of what is allowed and prohibited. But I would rather err on the sign of overly restrictive than loose because otherwise it can get out of hand. If I had my way, I would want to restrict paid mods to ones like falskaar only (large DLC/expansion style mods), but I don't think that is going to happen for a variety of reasons. 




 1. We're not really talking about voluntary donations here, since I don't think we're going to get that. This is making the best of a bad situation.

2. People hate messages interrupting play. I think a better system would have something like Nexus' endorsements pop ups  




 Much of your argument hinges on the notion that "finished" and "ideal" are the same things, when they are not. 

You're correct, in a sense. The problem is where the line is drawn. For example, if you were not able to use the mouse on the PC UI, would you call it finished? What if you had to use the arrow keys instead of the WASD keys? I contend that vanilla skyrim UI for PC is neither ideal nor finished, both because of the bugs and the lack of functionality.

Even if Bethesda decided to skimp on PC UI again, they can't guarantee that the best, or most-well-known, UI overhaul that the community produces will be a paid mod. Even if they decide, "Oh, we can just let the community handle this," there's no guarantee that they'll profit from that specific decision.

You're correct on the details. But I, and a lot of others, are worried about the snowball effect of allowing those kind of mods to be allowed.

/u/DavidJCobb: All mods must have a seven day return policy, no questions asked and no consequences.

/u/BullZEye22: Mods should gather a certain amount of approval before they can be sold.

/u/fadingsignal: Behind the scenes, there should be a partially dedicated faster-response support team for mod authors. If a mod is having trouble because the Steam downloader is screwing it up, or there is abuse or stolen assets being used, someone who is a verified author should have a slightly elevated support level, so they can in turn better support their customers who purchase their mods.

**User convenience**

/u/DavidJCobb: Load order managers and mod managers are essential to using mods while keeping one's game stable, but Skyrim doesn't natively support these tools, and the average Steam user won't know much about them.

/u/fadingsignal: Option to set the minimum price to $0


For Unpaid Mods:

/u/NeuroticNyx: A donation button for unpaid mods on the Steam Workshop. No profit form Bethesda can be made from this, as it is not endorsed.

/u/MaryMudpie: A system of Pay-What-You-Want for all mods. (Probably not going to happen.)

/u/EggheadDash: A pop for a donation once the game is closed, with Yes/Remind me Later/No options.

**Compatibility patches**

Modders should be permitted to create compatibility patches between mods even when one of the mods is paid, so long as the compatibility patches don't use any resources from any of the original mods (including the paid one(s)) without their authors' permissions. Users should not be permitted to sell compatibility patches; they should remain free. This should rather neatly solve the community's concerns about the interoperability of paid mods; if a paid mod is good enough, I guarantee you that some industrious user will build a patch to make it work.


**Limitations on sale**

/u/DavidJCobb Mod authors should not be permitted to sell bugfixes for base game content, official DLC, or any other mods. These must be free. Obviously this policy must be worded in such a manner as to permit a mod author to continue selling a mod even if they must later release a bugfix for it; yet to forbid that author from releasing the bugfix itself as a separate paid product.

/u/DiamondMind: UI and other "fixes," not just bugs, should also never be sold.

Perhaps there should also be a lower limit on the content sold so that microtransactions like adding a sword aren't allowed.

**Theft**

If a mod author's resources are stolen and used in a paid mod, that author should be able to report that to Valve and have it acted on promptly. The thief's revenue should be transferred to the original author; or, if the author doesn't have payment details registered with Steam, the full amount should be held in escrow indefinitely, without a time limit, until it can be transferred to the original author.

This is of course unfinished, and there a lot more problems to address. Comment and I'll add it to the list!
 




 Skyrim's UI was finished. It just wasn't ideal for all platforms. 

I disagree and think these two statements contradict each other. 

If Bethesda were to deliberately leave part of a game unfinished, they'd necessarily be doing so for all platforms. 

I disagree with this as well. Just because a game was finished for consoles does not mean it was finished for PC. Since mods are only on PC, we should not allow them to make money off the mods fixing the "only PC" problems.

It seems pretty obvious that console sales dwarf PC sales; if Bethesda intentionally leaves a mess for modders to clean up, then they're openly and permanently screwing over the vast majority of their customers.

But in this case, they satisfied console users while leaving PC users to make due on their own. This obviously did not hinder game sales, and this shouldn't happen in the future.

Am I right in guessing that you're nervous about the prospect of SkyUI going pay-only?

No, it just got me thinking about it, though I do think those modders made the wrong choice. I don't think Bethesda should be making money off things which should have been done in the first place. 

Maybe we need a category of fixes vs. additional content? I don't know. 




  UI improvements are no more or less valid than improvements to other game systems, and should be permitted for sale.

My problem with this is we don't want to pay for things twice. Where should we draw the line between what will encourage developers to leave part of the game unfinished (and profit twice) and what will be a legitimate improvement? 




 Edit: Since this might not be clear:  **We're trying to keep the modding community as open and collaborative as possible while preparing for the inevitable paid mod scheme, especially for the next TES or Fallout game. This is not about giving Valve or Bethesda money, but about keeping modding alive for the next generation.**

I'm new to the modding community, which means I only started playing Morrowind a year ago and Skyrim over the last six months. But like people have been saying a lot, recent events have inspired me to give back. As I have next to no money and not enough time to learn to mod extensively (even though I played around with it a bit in Morrowind), I was thinking about what's going to happen in the future. I realized two things:

1. Paid mods are coming, no matter how much we protest. The Valve press release was pretty clear about that. 
2. Next time around, there won't be a community uproar at nearly the same scale. The Skyrim modding community is the biggest we have, another one won't be established by the time the next game is released. We can't stop the hundreds of thousands from buying the next Bethseda game, even if it is announced with paid mods. 

Since we can't stop paid mods arriving, I think the best solution is to preemptively speak as a community to Valve and Bethesda about what we *do* want. Reading around the forums, I've noticed most people don't have a problem with paid mods **in theory**, as long as several key conditions are met. However, the implementation this time around was abysmal and we all realized nothing but slow (or not so slow) decline of mods would come from it. 

So I have a radical idea. I think we should compile a list of the many sins that were committed, the problems they would cause, and improvements that would need to occur next time. We can present these to Valve/Bethesda as demands for the community to reluctantly support, or at least not condemn, paid mods. By conditioning our support on several key demands, we can make sure Valve sets up a marketplace that does not set off the disastrous effects we fear. Both parties would benefit: Since we can't stop paid mods, we could turn them into something which will have neutral or maybe even beneficial effects. Bethesda won't get the inevitable PR hit next time around, which is fresh in their minds right now and so holds the most power.

I've started small list below, and I think it would be great for the community to put together a comprehensive list and make it as official as possible. Hopefully this will be an opportunity to bring us together after the recent bitterness.

Here's my start, from what I've seen people saying. 

Issues:

1. The way the marketplace was set up encouraged crap shovelware micro transactions over good mods.
2. There is no good way to test a mod and return it if it doesn't work.
3. There is no way to make sure that the modder will continue supporting the mod through main game updates and other mod changes. 
4. Mods use one another assets all the time, which makes monetizing them a legal quagmire. In addtion, relying on modders and the community to police stolen assets in unworkable.
5. The paltry 25% the modders got was absolutely ridiculous.
6. The secrecy of the implementation runs counter to how the modding community functions.
7. Most of us using mods don't use the Workshop because of its limited functionality, meaning we can't access the mods posted like SkyUI 5.0.

(To see longer arguments for above points, go to [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/343jtf/your_voices_were_heard/cqr1041) by /u/xaliber_skyrim


Solutions: 

**Quality**

/u/test_subject6459: A paid mod being on the marketplace means that the developer has endorsed it as unofficial DLC for the game and guarantee it. This legitimizes the cut they take and gives them a stake to supervise which mods have their name attached. 

/u/DavidJCobb: All mods must have a seven day return policy, no questions asked and no consequences.

/u/BullZEye22: Mods should gather a certain amount of approval before they can be sold.

/u/fadingsignal: Behind the scenes, there should be a partially dedicated faster-response support team for mod authors. If a mod is having trouble because the Steam downloader is screwing it up, or there is abuse or stolen assets being used, someone who is a verified author should have a slightly elevated support level, so they can in turn better support their customers who purchase their mods.

**User convenience**

/u/DavidJCobb: Load order managers and mod managers are essential to using mods while keeping one's game stable, but Skyrim doesn't natively support these tools, and the average Steam user won't know much about them. This is quite possibly the largest barrier to modding. Bethesda must develop their own analogues to LOOT and MO/NMM, and integrate these directly into the PC versions of FO4 and TES6.

Authors should be permitted to upload full archives, rather than a BSA/ESP pairing (the current limitation), but the uploading of loose files should be discouraged, and some sort of warning should be indicated to the user in the Steam Workshop's UI.

/u/test_subject6459: Do not tie downloads into the workshop; allow them to be used like Nexus files. That way, Bethesda and other developers do not need to create their own tool and force us all to use it. 

/u/fadingsignal: Fix the Steam Downloader to be actually useful.

**Compensation**

For Paid Mods:

Modders need to get at least 50% of the sale. Valve and the publisher can work out how to split the other 50% on their own. There are more than enough differences between mods and other "industry practices" to allow this.

/u/fadingsignal: Option to set the minimum price to $0

/u/sleepystudy: Humble Bundle esqe slider when checking out, or perhaps a manual entry.

For Unpaid Mods:

/u/NeuroticNyx: A donation button for unpaid mods on the Steam Workshop. No profit form Bethesda can be made from this, as it is not endorsed.

/u/MaryMudpie: A system of Pay-What-You-Want for all mods. (Probably not going to happen.)

/u/EggheadDash: A pop for a donation once the game is closed, with Yes/Remind me Later/No options.

**Compatibility patches**

Modders should be permitted to create compatibility patches between mods even when one of the mods is paid, so long as the compatibility patches don't use any resources from any of the original mods (including the paid one(s)) without their authors' permissions. Users should not be permitted to sell compatibility patches; they should remain free. This should rather neatly solve the community's concerns about the interoperability of paid mods; if a paid mod is good enough, I guarantee you that some industrious user will build a patch to make it work.


**Limitations on sale**

/u/DavidJCobb Mod authors should not be permitted to sell bugfixes for base game content, official DLC, or any other mods. These must be free. Obviously this policy must be worded in such a manner as to permit a mod author to continue selling a mod even if they must later release a bugfix for it; yet to forbid that author from releasing the bugfix itself as a separate paid product.

/u/test_subject6459: UI and other "fixes," not just bugs, should also never be sold.

Perhaps there should also be a lower limit on the content sold so that microtransactions like adding a sword aren't allowed.

**Theft**

If a mod author's resources are stolen and used in a paid mod, that author should be able to report that to Valve and have it acted on promptly. The thief's revenue should be transferred to the original author; or, if the author doesn't have payment details registered with Steam, the full amount should be held in escrow indefinitely, without a time limit, until it can be transferred to the original author.

In particular, we need assurances that Valve will pay attention to content that was originally uploaded to other sites, or at least to the more notable ones, when investigating theft reports. The full details of their policies regarding theft should be made public.

**Transparency**

Speak to us every step of the way, and release a prototype version first that we can check for issues.

**Issues still to be addressed**

1. What happens if a modder wants to stop working on it and it breaks?


This is of course unfinished, and there a lot more problems to address. Comment and I'll add it to the list!
 




 If your mother is Jewish, it makes the halacha (Jewish legality) of the situation much simpler. 




  Is there not already tons and tons of free shovelware mods? Hundreds upon hundreds of nude mods, skins, bikinis, oversexualziation mods, completely stolen retextures, etc

Yes, there are lots of bad mods, but you can try them out and then uninstall if you don't like it, without going through a return and customer service. There is no way to do this under a paid model, or  to check if someone is reissuing textures that you made.

Also, it does seem like Valve has a vetting system to make sure that this is done correctly. They clearly did not open this system up to anyone who wanted to sell their mods with their limited offering. That in itself might limit the shovelware.

Have you looked at the page? Half right now are adding a random weapon or armor, and some are asking a ridiculous price.  

In regards to the numbers are possibly flexible, but Valve is providing transaction services, advertising, possibly vetting and implementation, and opening discourse with the developers to legitimize an income stream. Why does it matter that it is not an AAA title or a car, it requires someone's time. 

That still doesn't make the current split at all legitimate. 

In addition, the argument is that by generating a real revenue stream, mods will no longer be limited to small pieces of code but could spur the creation of more large overhaul mods or new innovative ideas that very often die in their infancy.

That's a nice theory, but we can already see what happens in reality. Instead, mods should be offered for pay *only* if it is one of these overhaul mods which can have a stable performance. No early access or microtransaction bullshit. There are better ways to go about it than what Steam is doing right now.

Making it a payment does tie up the legality, but is usually more reliable than donations in terms of making money. Which is why we see people sell their goods instead of relying on donations.

First, if you really want payment for your work, you can make your own game instead of a mod. Second, that's why I recommended the slider or big flashy donate button when you check out. Therefore, it's not mandatory but you can still pay if you want to support the modder.

In regards to your TL;DR, why can't it be about making a product? Mods have made great products, and have become better through monetization such as Counter Strike or Team Fortress which were originally mods. The old paradigm doesn't necessarily need to exist in the new, nor will the modding landscape necessarily look the same.

I am not necessarily objecting to a platform to sell large overhauls of games that are approved by the developer, and kind of unofficial DLC. But they should not claim to be the same as mods are now, nor have both small and large modifications. For a mod marketplace to work, the product needs to be a worthwhile investment and guaranteed, which will never be the case in this conception.  




 I think you have a few good points, but the bad far outweighs the good. 

Let's first consolidate what you think the arguments against this move are and make them stronger, and so refute your counterarguments:

 1. They all used to be free
 2. More people will want to make crappy mods for easy money

becomes: 

 1. This will significantly worsen the current "market" by incentivizing crap shovelware over good mods.

It's not that we're "entitled" to modder's work, as there are many modders who vehemently oppose Valve's move. Instead, this creates a worse environment for both modders and users. There are some crap mods now, but since modders are working for the love of the work over financial gain, the mod "market" isn't flooded with them. It is a very legitimate fear that the steam workshop will become like the google play store and microtransactions. No one outside of people trying to make a quick buck want that.

 6) People steal and reupload mods for profit

Have you seen Valve's customer service? There is no way to make this work well and efficiently, and no modder wants to check every day and issue DMCA notices to everyone who tries to copy their work. In addition, how are they supposed to check if you have to pay to find out what is in the mod? There could be assets in the code that aren't immediately obvious. Modders aren't a business and shouldn't have to behave like one. 

 3) A donate button is a better idea

 7) Steam gets 75% of the cut

 9) Its a cash grab for skyrim and older games


becomes: 

 2) Valve is claiming this is for the good of the modders, so that they get rewarded for their hard work. The fact that the modder gets only 25% of the cut, and ONLY if the mod sells at least $400 worth, shows that is a lie.

If Steam wanted to have modders rewarded, it would be very simple to create a big fat donate button on the mod page. Maybe a banner, or a humble bundle slider before you download. Anything is better than a forced payment, especially if the person who worked on this is barely getting any profit. This is not a AAA title or a car, it is usually a small piece of code released to make a game better. 

If Steam REALLY wanted a form a payment, there are better ways to split it. As Steam isn't really providing a new service to anyone by offering these mods, Steam should get a small cut; the original developer should also get one, as this is originally their product. Most people would be fine with 80% - 10% - 10%, or even anything over 50% for the modder. What we have now is ridiculous, and even worse that it's not even explicitly stated anywhere.

Last point: Making a payment rather than a donation makes the legality of mods incredibly more complicated. Up to now, it has been a community where people share their work and build off of others to make everyone benefit. From now on people will be closely guarding their assets to make sure others trying to profit off their work, and all the paid mods will have to be built from the ground up instead of being a collaborative effort. In addition, many mods use copyrighted materials, which has been fine up until now because everything has been free. It's all a quagmire if the modders, Valve, and the developer are profiting off of the work.


 4) Mods arent worth the price being advertised

 5) Mods that go out of date will be useless

 10) Developers will rely on modders to fix their games

 11) Modders will leave mods unfinished

Modding, up until now, has never been a product to sell, but something to give to the community. This change upends the modder-consumer relationship entirely. 

1. From /u/Red_Inferno at /r/Games: 
I find this to be very dangerous. What happens if the devs create an update and suddenly half your mods stop working and 25% of the mods that are not working also no longer have a dev to fix them? It seems to me like there has to be a guarantee of support from the people who make the mods that does not appear to be there. Then the question becomes should valve have to refund people if their mods are no longer usable? What happens if someone dies who made a great mod and this happens? Will valve fix it? Will the skyrim devs fix it? Will it go opensource?

2. You envision some kind of culpability system for modders who make bad products. But again, modders and businesses. What if they decide to abandon their product because they no longer find modding worthwhile? There goes your 50+ hour save which contained your scripted mod, because those things are difficult to uninstall completely and can screw up your game. What stops someone from saying that they promise they'll complete a mod someday but never follow through while they rake in the cash? It's already bad with early access games and greenlight, so why do we think it will be any different with mods? If you think there is an accountability system that would work, describe one, because right now it looks like there will be zero accountability if something goes wrong, one way or another.

3. Most larger mods require testing by lots of people to make them work correctly without (a lot of) crashing. Nobody will want to pay to test these mods, especially when there is no guarantee that there will eventually be a finished product. Making a mod in a job for one person, but making it work takes the community.

 8) Free mods at other places will dry up

Nobody is "entitled" to the mod for free. But this has been a resource that lots of people relied on and contributed to. Why should they stand by as this all dries up? Making mods into DLC means changing the very essence of what modding is.

**TL;DR: Modding has never been about creating a product, but about passion. This move by Valve will pressure modders to work as developers rather than hobbyists, to the detriment of everyone involved.** 




 An AEPi trip means a birthright trip sponsored by AEPi. It is common for organizations to have their own trips funded by birthright. 









  The risk vs. reward argument completely disregards the concept of bodily autonomy that most non-mentally-diseased humans of cognitive competence value.

So should children not get any vaccines until the age of consent in order to respect their bodily autonomy? 




  Is there actually any theology behind this very young age?

Yes. Abraham was commanded to circumcise Issac at 8 days, and so are Jews today. 




 The haaretz article only mentions de facto discrimination, which is definitely a problem. The first link has only two possible laws which are problematic, and even those have valid uses. We can talk more about them if you want a discussion.  




 Point out to me where.  




 If Palestinians are second class citizens in Israel, than I shudder to think what blacks are considered in the US, since they are often treated worse.  




 But to say that "women are just as bad (in regards sexual assault generally)" is ridiculous. 

I think it's more that both men and women act badly when in positions of power, but it happens that men are in those positions more often.  




 No, it means he refused to accept citizenship when it was offered and is now paying the price.  




 That was amazing. 




 Thanks for the chance!  









  but the rockets have not really been an issue for Israel over a decade now

not true. we haven't had a war with hezbollah in a decade, and that was bad. Even with Iron Dome, people fear that the next war up north will be worse. 




 It (well, not homosexuality, but homosexual acts) is a sin, but not THE sin of sodom and Gomorrah.   




 I also work there. It's good for retail, but not much room for advancement.  




 As someone who just read the comic after watching the movie several years ago, I disagree. The movie modified the themes of anarchy and individual power to be about freedom and group power, but keep most of the symbolism intact. I think the movie also made the ending quite a bit better.  




 And apparently the natural solution is to change the victim rather than the attacker.  




 Yes, blaming the victim always leads to the best solutions! I dare you to say this to your Jewish friends' faces and see how they react.  




 So, as a Jew, I've never been comfortable making the sign of the cross or saying the prayers

If you feel uncomfortable with some of the most basic tenants of Catholicism, why do you want to convert? 




  Satan, a free willed angel (capable of supernatural actualizations) exists (if Satan can be shown in actualization, then other members of the supernatural Deity hierarchy will be accepted) 

This is not part of Jewish theology. 




 And how does jesus fit into all these statements? Seems to me that "there is none other"  is pretty clear cut.  




 Hey, why not? 23 year old male in Boston, somewhere in between Conservative and orthodox. Looking for friends as well as dating, so go ahead and message me! :) 




 Looking through his later comments, he is definitely Israeli. I just think he despaired and doesn't follow the news anymore, or only gets it from news to the left of haaretz. 




 Has to be Jewish. There just can't be a future with someone who doesn't share the same core values that I do. 




 Indosians go in, whites go out. You can't explain that with the patriarchy!  




 Before, and it worked. 




 War =  dead children = attention = money. Hamas was starved of funds and losing support, so they needed a conflict to get back both. 




 That's why this kind of "analysis" baffles me. These researchers aren't even in Israel to see the evidence. Unless everyone was hallucinating rockets being blown up, it's working. 




 They actually use sub-human? Are we laguz now? Did I change into a dragon when I wasn't paying attention? 




 Simple: That in Deuteronomy 18, there is no prophecy. There is merely a description of what a prophet is. Also, it does say that the prophet will come from among you, i.e. the children of Israel.

The post linked has some vague analysis which is pretty disconnected from the source text. I'm not going to bother going through each point. 




 That is literally impossible, because no one aside from the state owned the Negev, which made up at least 25% of the Palestinian Mandate. So how the hell did they get 85%? 




  who at that stage legally owned only 7% of it and remained a minority (33% in 1946) of the population."[1] 

How much did the Arabs there own? 




 Sonnet #90 sure sounds like it's talking about my love life right now. Does that mean Shakespeare predicted my heartbreak? 




 Yes, I've read it. I've read Tehillim several times over, in fact. I still don't see what an inspirational poem has to do with Jesus. 




 What is this from? 




 The government is not based on Judaism any more than England is based on Anglicanism, and probably less. A Jewish state, in this case, means a state for Jews, not a state for Judaism. 




 You tell me listen. I have the full text, and I don't see it. Quote a line or two. 




 To answer your question, the main argument the israeli regime has to justify what its doing is the Nazi treatment of the Jews in WW2. They use it both as a fear mongering tactic for their own people, and a shame tactic for anyone who dares question their crimes.

Anti-Israel say this all the time, but the only thing Israelis ever say that comes close is that they need a state so that a similar massacre never happens again. I've never seen anyone cite Nazi treatment for Israeli brutality. Show me one. 




 Oh, I've read a lot of books, especially on this. Back to the discussion: You said you knew a lot about this conflict, and I did not. Do you or do you not believe that Israel was founded because "the Nazis killed a bunch of" Jews?  




 If you actually believe Israel was founded because "the Nazis killed a bunch of Jews" and you think that you're educated about all this, I feel sorry for you. Do you think that Assad was actually good to Syrians, too? 




 Yeah, it's not good. Guns aren't toys. But I would be would be more calm in the face of a rifle in the hands of someone in the professional army rather than the police. But it's not a good situation for the kids, you're right.
 




 I know where people are coming from.

Really?

But they left and came back because....wait for it...the Nazis killed a bunch of them

No, no you don't. 




 Don't take something out of context and I won't make fun of it. There are much better ways to characterize this video that don't play up sympathy at the expense of the truth.

You really need to understand where people are coming from before attacking them, because you're only making yourself look bad. 




 You've demonstrated your ignorance about the history of Jews and the region throughout this entire post. 




 I don't think he was. He had only one hand on it (standard protocol in case someone tries to grab it) and his hand wasn't on the trigger. Maybe he should have pointed down? Yeah, maybe. But it's such a weird thing to get upset over... 




 interrogating innocent children

Oh no! Sounds horrible! What did they do? Tie them up? Force them to be without food and drink for hours? Made them answer questions about every detail of their lives? Sell out their parents?

...wait, all that happened was the got out of bed, asked their names, and had their picture taken? I've had worse *interrogations* at the principal's office. 




 I don't think you picked up on the sarcasm. 




 The only thing that happened here is that the children got out of bed and were asked their names. OMG, the horror. The U.S. police do worse, regularly. 




 What is this? Soldiers coming into the house in the middle of the night. SWAT teams in the US do worse regularly. 




 Oh, it legit. The Israeli soldiers are speaking Hebrew and the Palestinians are speaking Arabic. The IDF does do middle of the night "raids" like this sometimes. But...nothing happens. as you can see from the video, it's more tame than a police raid in the U.S., and definitely better than the no-knock warrants that are constantly in the news. 




 You're own quote is proving you wrong. Verse 12 says that whoever is murders another person should be executed. Verse 13 says if the killing is unintentional, the killer has a place to flee to [if a relative of the deceased pursues him]. Verses 18-19 speaks of injury but not death. Verses 21-22 again speak of injury, but not death. There isn't even a clause for the person who caused the miscarriage to flee to a refuge city, which means that the miscarriage was not seen as equivalent to killing, intentional or not. 




 I just don't care enough to debate on NT grounds. Maybe a better sentence would be "You can only argue that Christianity is internally consistent if you ignore the Judaism that preceded it." It doesn't make much of a difference to me.  




 This Is The Part Where He Doesn't Kill You 




 That wasn't Aushwitz, it was another death camp. There were a dozen or so. 




 Yes, before it was agreed that Jesus was part of God. 




 Why are you giving me a poem? Should we use Shakespeare's sonnets as predictors of events too? Prove to me that Psalms is prophetic, without referring to Jesus, and then we can talk about this one. 




 Christianity is only internally consistent if you ignore the Judaism that preceded it. 




  Christianity is the only faith that teaches that God has done all the work required for salvation, all other faiths teach that man must do all the world.

This is what makes Christianity so irrational as a religion. God made us so...nothing? 




 Aside from Jewish and maybe descendent of David, no he really didn't. Most prophecies given are usually not prophecies at all, or completely misinterpreted.  




 By this standard, all of the NT is invalidated. 




 And yet, he walked away instead of talking. Has this put the Palestinians in a better position? 




 Jews have the right of return to Israel, Palestinians will have a right of return to Palestine. Seems pretty simple. 




 You're missing the fact that Palestinians in the West Bank in Gaza aren't robots controlled by outside forces, nor are they slaves to their baser natures. In addition, the rise of Hamas is much, much more complicated than that. in short, they were not forced into anything but rebelled against the PLO when Arafat "renounced" violence at the Oslo Accords. Even now, if there were non-violent protests in the West Bank, as well as other demonstrations that show the Palestinian people are ready for peace, the Israeli electorate would vote in a left wing government to negotiate it. 




 Likud does get stuff done in Israel though. They don't throw shit everywhere and call it a day.  




 chabad, sometimes 




 What is your view on the Arab-Israeli conflict as well as anti-Semitism in the Muslim world?  




 Hey, want to move to Israel? Lots of atheists here!  




 I was going to say talk to him for a bit and see what he was thinking, but there are way to many red flags here. Say you're not feeling it and you don't want to date anymore. It's very likely he will fly off the handle, which really tells you all you need to know. Just do it in a public place. 




 As someone playing through the game for the first time right now, thank you for that! 




 No, I heard of these verses from a friend, 

And where did he get them from? As gingerkid said, they are probably out of context or made up. For example, the gittin quote, why do you think this refers to Jesus at all? All it says is "sinners of Israel?"

 I am just curious as to how modern jews view these verses

Here's the thing, they're not verses but rather arguments or opinions. The Talmud is a very complicated legal document, not the straight word of God. So the quotes were of some Rabbi, probably quoting his Rabbi. Just because someone in authority 1500-2000 years ago said something does not mean it is a divine decree. 
 




 More proof that "messianic Judaism" is simply Christianity in disguise.  




 Ad-hominem, insulting, and not relevant. What do **you** think Judaism believes about Satan? Since you are dismissing the views of actual Jewish people on this sub, provide some sources please. 




 This is might be because you have too many choices. Having more choices about what to do can actually be worse for your happiness than having no choice at all. Humans are weird like that. 




 Yep.
 




 I do not have sources handy at the moment, maybe others here can give them to you. But it is supposed to be the same as described in the Torah about God's presence descending upon the Mishkan once it is built. See Exodus 40:34. 




 The standard Jewish belief is that God's "presence" (shechina) rested inside the Temple, not that God himself came down. God does not have physical form, and so cannot physically descend. 




 I think the article is a good analysis, even though the author relies heavily on one or two sources. However, I think they're mistakenly conflating the reform and conservative movements. They are not the same movement, and the critiques levelled toward the reform movement do not apply in the same way to the conservative one. I don't see any other explanation as to why traditional egalitarian Judaism has failed as well as liberal Judaism, except for the Orthodox monopoly and the widely held idea that they are torch bearers of the faith.  




 Those are a lot of quotes...and none of them have sources! So legit. 




 The second lord isn't specified at all, we don't know who the author was intending to talk about. Why do you think it is even about the messiah in the first place? Also, the second lord is not referring to a deity. The two lords in the phrase are different words in Hebrew. The first is deific, the second is just an honorific. The nt here, like in most places jesus argues,  is a strawman.  




 Ask! Go to synagogue! As long as you're respectful, everyone loves talking about themselves. 




 No, it is used to refer to "a god," an idol. Not the God. 




 These have all been answered long ago. Angels, Angel (who are also Elohim as are judges), God's Spirit (do you think God has an actual face and back?), bad translation ("My Lord said to my lord, etc. The second lord refers to David himself.)

I'm not going to touch the trinity argument (though it could be wrong) because I don't care enough about it.  




 That's an adjective, not smichut, I think. 




 All words have both singular and plural in Hebrew by the way the grammar is structured. There is no such thing in Hebrew like "fish" can be used in both singular and plural contexts. The word sky "shamaim" does have a singular, it just does not refer to the sky. Likewise, the word "elohim" does have a singular, it is just not used to refer to God. 




 Eh, everybody stereotypes in comparison to their normal. I've heard people from the south say that everyone up north is rude and doesn't know proper manners. 
























 Then you have a bug, report it on the forums 




 Just move away until the horse marker isn't on the minimap anymore and he'll respond. 




 Press tab 









 Sorry, should have been a little more clear. Changed the ones which could be optional 




 Ah, I didn't realize the rarity step. Thanks! 




 This is buy back, for if you accidentally sell something  




 Theoretically. But you have access to the "storage chest" all the time, even when fighting. 




 Hadn't heard of this idea before! I'll add it in. 




 It's also if you hit anything on the way down. 




 As someone who hasn't read the books yet, I somewhat disagree. Yes, a lot of these things are easier to miss, but if you pay attention most of it is explained as backstory. Is it perfect? No, and I felt lost sometimes. But they made the games well enough that you don't lose too much. 




 I play with KB/M, can you explain?

 




 Added! 




 Added! 




 But why should you have to loot so much to find it? 




 I believe starred items (new) are always sorted at the top. Then once you look at them, the sorting is by type. Within each type, it's sorted by how new they are to the inventory. If you drop something and pick it up again, it should be the last one of that type. 




 Edited to be clear.  




 You can, it's the "change objective" button. You can also turn off the dotted line entirely.  




 Weird, I'll look out for it. They do have a thread for bug reports on the cdpr forums, you should probably post it over there. 




 The actual mechanics of this is that when sword is not out, the other items gain the same amount of damage that your basic fists do

That is so weird. Either way, I think it's a bug and should be fixed to a standard.

Personally I really like the grid system since it gives you a visual representation of where everything is.

I would agree except that everything is jumbled together, especially on the equip screen. It looks a little ugly instead. 




 Even when I roll I sometimes lose a lot of health.  




 I found one...once.  




 Awesome job guys! I've barely got to Skellige and I'm 80+ hours into the game already. IMO, this should go into the list as one of the best games of all time. 

However, there are a bunch of things that people have found to be annoying about the gameplay, which, if fixed, would make the game even more enjoyable. Since you guys don't have the time to be reading every post, a lot of these probably slipped past you. So I took the time to compile all of the complaints/proposed fixes I saw and made them into a list. Here they are!

**Important:**

* Fix fall damage! Make it less, automatic roll, etc. Maybe a potion. We should be able to jump from heights like in the Witcher 1 intro video.
* More key bindings, fix some of the ones available. For example, right now sheath and dive can only use the same button if you keep the default.
* Swimming Controls
* Horse Controls (ex. doesnt stop randomly, reliably navigate around objects, automatic jumping over low barriers)
* **Storage**: Please give innkeepers stashes like in the two previous games, or maybe a 'Travelers Storage chest' at all inns so we don't have to talk to someone to access our stuff. There are many options for this, but I would like to have all the types of witcher armor and swords available somewhere, though not necessarily on me. Maybe Roach should be a storage chest?
* More options, especially for potions and bombs, in the quick access wheel, like this: http://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/374d3l/anyone_else_wish_they_had_something_like_this/[3]. This isn't necessarily the answer, but applying oils, switching bombs, and drinking potions is cumbersome right now. It would be alleviated somewhat with extra tabs (see below), but not entirely.

**Combat:**

* Jump while in combat
* It seems that if the sword is out, all other items deal ~ as much damage. Is this intentional? 
* Larger axis of rotation when aiming crossbow and bombs. There's a small limit right now, and sometimes I can't shoot high enough to hit flying monsters.
* Make it easier to run away from a fight, Geralt sticks to the enemy too aggressively.
* Auto sheathing swords sometimes happens while still in combat but a little far away, or an archer is targeting and you can't parry because you didn't close yet.
* Option to manually turn on and off combat mode.

**Economy:**

* Merchants need a buy back feature at the price it was sold at. Maybe this should be in a different tab so that the sold items don't clog up the main screen.
* The buy/sell ratio should be more equalized. Right now it is a little ridiculous for both gameplay and immersion.
* There is very little coin in the beginning of the game, and lot once you hit level 12 or so.  
* Food and alcohol prices and extremely high.

**HUD:**

* Adjustable minimap size
* Slower, larger combat and item log
* A toggle button
* Smaller size possible
* Being able to move it to the actual edge of the screen (adjustable settings don't get it quite there)
* An option for a compass/clock without the minimap

**Map:**

* Zooming out more
* Quest filtering/switching on map; maybe have the option show all quests in grey, and clicking on a marker makes it the active quest.
* Multiple quests shown
* Option to show a map of the inside area of a cave on the large map screen
* Custom notes
* Icons for merchants, blacksmiths, and armorers dont disappear when they unload
* The world map is hard to scroll with a gamepad, the cursor sticks very aggressively to icons.

**Crafting and Alchemy:**

* Monster mutagens could be disassembled/be used for regular upgrades
* A sort function in the crafting window, perhaps by item level or damage/armor so that we don't have to look through everything to find the best one.
* Tabs in the dismantling menu
* The collapsible menus should not reset.
* Choosing whether or not to replenish potions and bombs when meditating; and/or choosing to refill potions without meditating.
* Hide feature for already crafted potions; on the same note, don't replace the old recipe with the enhanced one.
* Crafting should also have a item is already owned notification when confirming so you don't make something twice
* When dismantling items, show how much of the components I already own and how much they are worth. How am I supposed to make a decision between dismantling and selling if I don't know if a component is rare or valuable?
* Highlight new recipes
* Allow us to auto-buy missing materials from the vendor if he stocks them, or double clicking on the material from the crafting screen.  Now you have to look at the material missing, look for it in between a huge list then look what do you need to craft it and search again.
* Possibly remaking a piece of equipment to rise its level to your own

**Quests:** 

* Have active quest appear in the quest menu when opened, and save the drop down state.
* Make the flavour text of quests and glosary entries more friendly when they update.
* Easy searching of completed quests.

**Inventory:**

* New tab for Books   Letters   Notes
* Books and scrolls should have an additional tooltip line indicating read/unread
* Books and letters should have the option to be read when picked up/looted, instead of having to find it in the inventory
* New tab for food or potions/oils/decoctions
* Different tabs for crafting   alchemy
* A sort function with multiple options (weight, price, quality, level req., name, etc.). On that note, how are they currently sorted? Pickup time?
* A way to fav/trash items
* A tab for Gwent cards in the inventory 
* When buying from a merchant or looting, items should have a line in their info popup that states either "Owned: (#)" or "Unowned"
* There is a lot of dead space on the screen. Either expand the grids or use it in another way?
* **Maybe**: A list option instead of a grid system

**Other/Controversial/Inane:**

* Better navigation of menus (e.g. quick exit)
* Option to turn subtitles off for English/chosen language but keep them for the other languages in game in order to understand them.
* More higher level quests
* Better leveling -- doing all the side quests leaves you way over leveled
* Better trophies
* Fix item weight (feline armor set should not weigh more than griffen!)
* More things to do, people to talk to after the main story
* Rewards that correlate to quest level. My blade of the bits was level 15 because that's when I started the quest, even though I ended it at level 19 or so. My masterwork sword was outclassed by the time I got it.
* Assign a hotkey for reapplying current oil
* Being able to loot under your feet. You currently have to move a little.
* Option to reduce the frequency of background music playing. It's unrelenting, there's never a quiet moment. Especially since your environmental sound effects are some of the best I've heard.
* FOV slider
* Fist fights should not immediately start on a cutscene ending. There isn't enough time to react.
* An expanded glossary: Herb locations/descriptions, cities/factions/locations, etc.
* The drop rate for some alchemy substances is low for rare monsters, like a golem heart or ekkimarra hide. Can we get either the monster to appear more often, a higher drop rate, or special alchemy merchants to sell these for high prices?
* More gradient speeds
* Cloaks and hoods would look really cool
* Camera zoom in and out, if possible.
* Ability to pause cutscenes.
* Meditating should save the game.


**Extra Requests: (Ignore this):**

* Romance DLC
* Allow Geralt to imbibe more alcohol.
* Ability to give money to beggars

Thanks again! We really appreciate all your hard work! 

Non CDPR people: Add your own in the comments. Maybe CDPR will hear you too. ;)

Edit: Edited

Edit 2: Since I'm not going to bother responding to every person, I have a few points:

1. These are suggestions I have seen people have that I thought made sense or seen other people agree with. Yes, some are frivolous, but I purposely did put not graphics or bugs/glitches here. Would you prefer this or a bunch of people continuing to make the same complaints over and over? This is deliberately a positive list of things to make the game better; if you have an objection to something on the list, say it! Writing that 80% of this is crap helps no one and only makes the entire discussion acrimonious.

2. Yes, these are minor improvements, only because the Witcher 3 is already such a great game. No, CDPR is not obligated to do anything. However, since they said they are reading this forum, why not bring issues to their attention? Lot's of good suggestions are buried. 

3. Sheesh people, stop freaking out about the list idea. It was a suggestion I saw a couple of times that I saw other people agree to. Thanks for making your objections known, CDPR probably won't do it. 

4. For the people who made more suggestions, thanks! I added some of them in. 




 The only problem is that the baron's quest get's stuck on investigating the wife's disappearance without and clues on where she it, and you just have to go on. That killed my immersion a little. 




 Yes! This means a Dark Souls 2 discount! 




 Nexus mods is wonderful, but it is really frustrating finding the right mods because of the bad UI. So to keep all the mods I might want straight in my own head, I made a mod list of everything uploaded so far. I realized that it might be helpful to other people too, so I made it publicly available on [google docs here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zStz8eChga1xHsntz2qKyBgK_BCy9_S-Pvnx4DfKRYk/edit#gid=0).

Then I realized that this would be a very good resource to the fledgling Witcher 3 modding community if more information could be filled in and the list could be continually kept up to date. Unfortunately, I have neither the time nor the resources to do it all by myself. Does anyone who thinks similarly about this want to help me? I especially want to know if it's possible to pull the information directly from nexus (like an API) instead of copy-pasting a bunch of things, since it would make managing updates, etc. a lot easier. 




 And then they have a clear weather, and you realize you're fucked! 




 but had he not killed himself and they had returned

he doesn't kill himself in every ending 




 Minimize your deck. You need a minimum of 22 unit cards, so keep exactly that amount of unit-cards, and trim your special cards. I have 22 unit cards, and 5 special cards (weather, scorch etc) in my deck. It improves your chances of getting the good cards and combos. 

Unless you're playing Monsters/Scoiateal with a bunch of calling cards. Then just load them all into the deck for a massacre. 




 Neat! Did you get the information from actually playing, or did you pull the info from the code somehow? 




 According to [another thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/37y5lr/increased_damage_with_sword_sheathed/), it seems to be all non sword items, including signs and bombs! No wonder everything else seemed so weak. 




 1. Remember that except for the last 200 years or so, everyone livid in small villages. It's very easy to pass down family traditions in this setting.

2. Being a Kohen is not just a term given to your family that can easily be forgotten. Even though in practice we have largely abolished the class system, there are different mitzvot that apply to you. Since a large requirement of Judaism is parents teaching their children, this is one of those things that would continue to be taught.

3. As a Kohen, one actually has a different role in the community. Duchaning (the kohen's blessing) is one of the largest. Even as you were separated from your parenys or your entire village at an early age, this thing is an easy identifier of your familial status. As a Kohen there are different rules for calling you up to the Torah; not only can you not go up at certain times, but when you do you are caled up as "name son of name the Kohen." So even for a non observant family that only goes to shul once a year, they would still need to know this little piece of info for the bar/bat mitzvah.

So yes, just like many other things the family tradition of being of Kohen can be lost, especially over the last a hundred years. There are numerous stories about a rediscovering of this kind of thing. But it is almost as hard as your family forgetting it was Jewish in the first place. 
 




 While we're in duh moments, is there anyway to get all the info of an item without hovering over it? 




 It would be so much more useful if we could have a potion quickbar. :( 




 They made a character that looks like him and named him Nick. See the pictures
 




 Hey, it's not so hard, I only built mine this past November! 




 Hey, if no one sees it what's the point of me making it? 




 Ok, just in case you're really missing the point: There is no way to beat the guard in the picture above unless you want to spend half an hour fighting. This doesn't make sense, narratively, because why are there people so much stronger than Geralt?

This is about leveling and the fact that other enemies seem overpowered. Not you being weak. 




 Anyone know what the consequences are for the different decisions made in the Witcher 2? Obviously [Spoiler](/s "if you kill Sile and Letho they won't appear") but what about the others? If you save Triss are the witch hunters less prominent in the game? Does killing/leaving/saving Saskia make a difference at all? 




 I play with KB + M and I would prefer to attack whatever I'm looking at, even if another enemy is closer, without having to cycle through targets

I do too and never use the targeting button. The auto target usually works, I target whatever the camera points to. 




 Range indicator in the quest log (so it's easy to find nearby quest)

That is something I didn't know I wanted until right now. Yes!

Cooler and more diverse Trophy effects.

What would you like to see? 




 The only problem I have is Roach randomly stopping. What are your issues? 




 Why is that? In order to keep items (or parts of them) when over the weight limit? 




 How would you fix it? The only suggestion I saw that is remotely feasible is binding it to a different key.
 




 Use quen and a lot of dodging (not rolling). Apply spectar oil before hand. Use your potions And yes yrden does help, but you have to lure them into the trap, they're only slow inside it. 




 It's two buttons. Once you select the quest, press the map quickkey and then tab. 




 I was searching for mods and getting really annoyed but Nexus' UI. Since NMM doesn't work yet for the Witcher 3 (I think), I couldn't keep track of which mods I downloaded, if they updated, etc. It was also hard to compare
several mods of the same type.

[So, I made a list!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zStz8eChga1xHsntz2qKyBgK_BCy9_S-Pvnx4DfKRYk/edit#gid=0) 

Right now it's minimal -- I only included the link, name and author. In the first tab, I also broke them up into different categories to make them easier to sort. Maybe later the community can do something like Skyrim Gems, though I don't think the modding community will get quite that big since the Witcher is a more focused game.

If you want to help edit, shoot me a PM and I'll add you.

Enjoy!

Edit: If you're looking, upvote this so other people can see it too!

 




 I have no idea what happens at the final battle, I'm not there yet. How would you make it harder on Death March? 




 So the game has been out for almost two weeks now, and everyone loves it (I hope, otherwise what are you doing here?). But we all have our own individual problems we run into. Some people hate the UI, others the controls, or combat just doesn't work. But since we do a lot of complaining about what we don't like, can we try and imagine the best possible solution to it as well? Imagine you're at CDPR and you could change whatever you want, but with one caveat -- you have to try to keep as many people as happy as possible. What would be the best fix? 

I'll start: My biggest pet peeve is every single time when going into the crafting (and lesser extant alchemy) menus, everything is always open and it takes forever to scroll through and find what you want. And then when you do, it's hard to compare it to other one's on the list!

Solution: Save the open/close state of the menus instead of defaulting to open. Then in the bottom right corner where there is all that empty space, add a sort by level or alphabetical option. Everything would still be in the same categories, but now you won't have to squint to find your next tier sword among all the level 5 and 10s!

Your turn! Please keep spoilers to a minimum. 




 There were only 3 paper mario games, what are you talking about? There were no other paper mario games after the Wii. Certainly none on the 3DS. None whatsoever. 




 The Witcher 3 is an absolutely amazing game. I don't know if I'll put as the best game I've ever played quite yet (I just finished the prologue!) but I wouldn't be surprised if it gets there.

That said, there are some issues I've had and others I've seen people complain about on this board and elsewhere. With the newest patch giving more key binding options, it seems that CDPR is really listening in order to make the Witcher 3 the best game it can possibly be. So, I think instead of complaining in individual topics and comments, we should make one topic for all the issues people would like tweaked so that CDPR can better address our concerns. It would be great for the mods to make a sticky out of it, but for now I'll start here. If you comment I can add the the issue in the OP!

**Combat:**

* More options in the quick access wheel. Potions should have their own tab instead of being part of consumables. 
* Either have oil in the quick access menu or as a hotkey.

**Economy:**

* Merchants need a buy back feature at the price it was sold at. Maybe this should be in a different tab so that the sold items don't clog up the main screen.

* The buy/sell ratio should be more equalized. Right now it is a little ridiculous for both gameplay and immersion.

**HUD:**

* Adjustable minimap


**Map:**

* Zooming out more
* Labels without hovering for better info
* Quest filtering/switching on map
* Option to show big map of cave, inside area, not just world map

**Inventory:**
(adapted from [the other thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/373eim/cdpr_please_say_that_you_will_update_the_inventory/))

* New tab for Books   Letters   Notes

* Separate food and other usable items. In addition, have a separate slot to put potions to use in combat!

* Different tabs for crafting   alchemy stuff (they don't belong together)

* A sort function with multiple options (weight,sell price,quality,level req., name, etc.)

* A sort function in the crafting window, perhaps by item level, newness, or damage/armor so that we don't have to look through everything to find the best one.

* A way to fav/trash items; a small symbol could appear in the bottom corners (PS4 - click left stick to Fav an item* / click right stick to designate an item to sell/dismantle once you get to a shop http://americandigest.org/trashcan.jpg) a feature from the borderlands games that was very helpful.

* Dismantling is hard! why is everything in the inventory suddenly grouped together in the dismantling menu, please give us the tabs back here!

* Please give inn keepers stashes like in the two previous games, or maybe a 'Travelers Storage chest' at all inns so we don't have to talk to someone to access out stuff. There's stuff I might want to keep (like witcher gear) but don't want to keep with me at all times! Putting them in random places in the overworld gets annoying.

* Please make a way of showing what Gwent cards we have in the inventory perhaps in there own tab so that we don't accidentally buy cards we already own. Having to pause the game and open the Gwent menu is kinda a hassle just to check which cards we own.

* All items in the game should have a line in their info popup that states either "Owned: (#)" or "Unowned"

* Books and scrolls should have an additional tooltip line indicating read/unread

* Choosing whether or not to replenish potions and bombs when meditating.

**General UI:**

* The down menus in alchemy and crafting should not reset.

* Better navigation of menus (e.g. quick exit)

* More options for key-binding  DONE!

* http://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/374d3l/anyone_else_wish_they_had_something_like_this/

Remember: Don't just complain! Offer a solution to the issue you're having instead of bitching about it. We're trying to help CDPR make Witcher 3 the best game it can be, not bash them. 




 It's if you move the mouse while pressing escape, it cancels the escape attempt. 




 Yes! Key bindings was one of the main things I was annoyed about. Hopefully they can fix the menu next. 




 Play people with worse decks like innkeeps and shopkeepers, and buy more cards. Yes, the starter pack isn't great. 




 Any books which focus on 47-48 civil war and the 48-49 independence war will devote some time to this topic. I recommend one or two classic Israeli, one revisionist Israeli, and one Palestinian to get a few range of views. Unfortunately I don't have any specific recommendations since it's been a while since I read these and I'm a little bit biased, but I'm sure you can find some good ones. 




 It's a large combination of factors, including: relations with the local Jewish community, security threat, individual commander choices, levels of fear, etc. This is a question for /r/AskHistorians and then one to read a few books about. 




 Anyone know how to get rid of items once you put them in your cart? I want to check out, but I don't actually want to spend that much money. 




 Hey! Just an idea I had while browsing games today. Maybe ascension should have some kind of check you can run where you can import your cart from websites and see what games you already own. It's getting hard to keep track of everything I have. 




 Is there a defense that she might have been raped? Yes, from what's come to light it's a possibility. But how she's been behaving means that whatever sympathy she had is turned to a political issue. I'm just mad that they let her do this as a senior thesis. 




 This is bugging me, and I want to know the answer before starting the game. If you choose not to import of simulate a save, what are "default" choices made for you? Does anybody know? My google skills have failed me today.

And does anybody know the consequences in the witcher 3 for each of the choices? 




 The West Bank was granted to the Arab state

When? 




 They are hypocrites in a lot of ways. The rest of us learn to deal with it.  




 she says "are German and are Jewish" 




 The professor called Israel and students in the audience Nazis. She objected to the offensive characterization and he responded that  because his parents were in concentration camps he has every right to call other people Nazis if he wants. 




 Rekt 




 There's also the halacha that a non makom kavua does not need a mechitza either.  




 There is zero prohibition in any orthodox Shul I've ever attended for women to have a separate minyan.

But it is almost never done, for a large part because there is a strong social sanction against it. 

What does the rest of your post have to do with  our discussion?  




 So, the reason it's ok for the Kohanim to get special treatment is because it's d'oraissa? 

Yes, and personally I feel better about it because of the explicit balancing laid out. 


If there was a source d'oraissa that said women were not obligated to pray three times a day, would you drop the egalitarianism?

1. In this argument I'm advocating, at minimal, equality without egalitarianism. Do you have response to that? 
2. I'm pretty sure there isnt; I recall a sugya that states the time-based positive mitzvah rule is a guideline at best. And even if there is, why does that stop a woman from taking on the obligation and then leading? Or leading in the non time bound services? 

This also doesn't address the argument of women holding women only minyanim, women being excluded from communal leadership positions, etc.  




 Korach is not a problem because the shul I go to are egalitarian in regards to the sexes but not other societal roles. Kohanim got the first aliyah, etc. 

The Torah says we shouldn't steal. So, if men are constantly stealing, should we change the rules to allow stealing? 

Funny thing is, this is a legitimate way for a community to reject halacha derabanan! If they don't follow it, it will eventually be abrogated. No, the same isn't true for Torah laws, but I think it is important to point out we can change the rules. 


What if men didn't abuse the position? What if the Saducees hadn't abused their priesthood during the times of the Second Temple?

The torah has explicit balancing measures to make sure that the priests didn't abuse their authority. But it has no such balancing measures between man and woman, especially those which would apply to today. In addition, from what I see men over the past centuries have used this loppehole to craft halacha and minhag which excludes women from any say in the community. Modern Orthodoxy has taken remarkable steps to attempt to remedy this, but IMO it is not quite there yet.

The fact of the matter is (and this is where we will have an eternal debate that we will never resolve) I believe the Torah represents the Truth of the universe and that man fails miserably to live up to that Truth.

I am arguing from this principle, and I'm trying to live my life by it. I think our disagreement lies in what we interpret as torah. While I believe in torah she bealpe, I don't believe that everything the rabbis say or pasken count as that torah, and I am fully in favor changing halacha derabanan or minhag to achieve equality. The fact is that people hide behind halacha to keep power, and I find that unacceptable. 

Edit: I largely agree with yodatsracist's latest post.  




  The modern world comes along and says: not egalitarian means discrimination but that's not even factually correct, is it?

 An employer isn't better than an employee. It's just a different role.

 A teacher isn't better than a student. Different role.

 That's what Parsha Korach comes to teach us. True equality is that, irrespective of our role before God, we are all like nothing before the Eternal and we should stop worrying about the attractiveness of the other role and focus on our own the best we can.

I agree and disagree. I've been involved in both Conservative and Orthodox communities, and I see this is true *in theory.* However, it is clear that it is also used as an excuse the more right you go. When haredim don't allow women any kind of public influence, the stated reason is that their role is in the home. When women aren't allowed to lead services like kabbalat shabbat even though they would like to, it's because their role is not to their role to lead the community in prayer.

I fundamentally disagree with you because I see the Torah does teach equality in many places, even if it not egalitarian equality. As you gain more power, you are also mandated more responsibility. The Kohanim must continually keep themselves tahor, Levites cannot hold any land and must serve as teachers, landowners must give so much to ones who do not own land, etc. This also applies in the secular world; the employer must provide and not take advantage of their employee, and teacher has an obligation to treat students fairly and ensure the best education.

The problem comes when the power is taken without responsibilities and repercussions. In the secular world, it was when teachers abuse students, when employers work their employees mercilessly in awful conditions. In Judaism, it was when the community did not take care of the downtrodden, when the Levites seized political power. 

This is what I see happening in Judaism. Yes, in theory men and women are equal in different roles and men have more mitzvot to keep. But in practice, men take the power and use it to isolate women. Men are supposed to get consequences in Olam Habah if they abuse this power, but that doesn't remedy the inequality we see here in our communities on Earth. One solution is egalitarianism between the sexes, which of course creates its own set of problems. But it is not a solution to say that we are all technically equal so lets all continue as we are and not worry about it.

This is an issue that has been troubling me for a while, so I would appreciate a response. 


 









 I've been creating some merged plugins, mostly from the DLC/patches individual mods have because those are the safest. What are script fragments and navmesh edits, and how do I check for them? 




 Just read all the books, read all the Cosmere info, and then re-read the books! 




 :D  




 Hell, it already blows up! I hadn't run ASIS yet, thanks. 




 Go to STEP, and see if that works for you. They also have their own forums you can request help in. 




 I installed pretty much everything I would ever want for Skyrim mods. I used STEP, step packs, and Skyrim gems, as well as looking for other mods I liked. It seemed like it would never stop! I think I got all I wanted for now, thank god. I have played a little vanilla skyrim and some 30+ hours into a STEP extended playthrough, so I'm not doing this blindly and I know about the 255 plugin limit.

So, what can I do now? I've heard a little about merging plugins, but I don't know how I go about that and how it will effect the LOOT order, among other things. What can I do to reduce the amount of plugins I use so I can actually play the game?

http://modwat.ch/DiamondMind#/plugins

Thanks! 




 Thanks! Exactly what I was looking for. 




 I just came across this, and I just want to say that it looks amazing! I wish I could help some, but I noticed the applications are closed for right now. 

Anyway, my two cents: My main problem with the current setup with all the different clients is **not** the separate storefronts, because we have different stores everywhere we go. I think the bigger issue is organizing the games you have bought and/or downloaded all in one place, because right now its a major hassle. If I was in charge I would ignore the storefront for now and just work on that. ;) But I'm not, so thank you and and I hope this works! 




 Thank you, that is exactly what I was looking for! This should be publicized more. 




 With the launch of GOG beta, it's getting increasingly difficult to manage several game clients and keep track of all the games you have/are installed on the computer. It's hard enough on Steam itself, let alone juggling two or more programs to find your game if you're not sure where you got it. Steam has a very limited feature to add outside games, but it is time consuming and not very useful. 

Are the any game organizers, out or in development, which can take the data from each client and organize it? Yes, Razor Cortex is an option, just not a very good one. It wouldn't have to be very complicated, just a simple organizer (by name, category, client, etc.) with a link to each game shortcut for the game to launch without going through the client. You could still use Steam and the rest for the community aspects, in or out of game, but you wouldn't need the open the client to do so.

I think this would be a **very** useful feature which would cut down on the hassle we have now, and which will only get worse in the future. If there isn't one in development, does anyone know how difficult it would be to make?

Edit: Apparently /r/Project_Ascension is trying do something similar. Go check it out! 




 I have it. But it comes with too many other things you might not want, and the UI for finding games it annoying. There isn't even a way to make the icons smaller! Something more user friendly/configurable would be nice. 




 With the launch of GOG beta, it's getting increasingly difficult to manage several game clients and keep track of all the games you have/are installed on the computer. It's hard enough on Steam itself, let alone juggling two or more programs to find your game if you're not sure where you got it. Steam has a very limited feature to add outside games, but it is time consuming and not very useful.

 So what you're saying is gun control does work?  




 The Witcher 3 is definitely worth pre-ordering, and I haven't pre-ordered a game in years.  




 I have a Motorola Razr and it's fucking awful.  




 Pre-order the Witcher 3 to show that some companies are still trusted!  









 He disabled it :P. He changed the the price at my request though, thanks 




 I was about to buy from him and then he raised it to $30 :/ How do you make a lower offer? 




 Damn. I'm having the same problem. I guess I have to go back to all my mods to check. 




 There is a difference between abandoning the religion and converting; the latter is seen as much more serious. 




 Did you ever figure this out? 




 Except then people will cry racism because the vast majority of Arabs also don't serve. 




 Just to correct the poster above you: Marriage laws are a holdover from the Ottoman empire which put marriage under the domain of the recognized religious authorities. This means that anyone can marry anyone, in theory, except that the religions have restrictions on it. Ask an imam to marry a Jew and a Muslim, and it won't go over so well either...

Women not being able to get a divorce is the opposite - true in theory, but not in practice. By quirk of Jewish law, the husband does have to *give* his wife a divorce, but if he refuses he is essentially expelled from society among other unpleasant things. Most "husbands" give in quickly. 

For the rest: 

places where you can't drive through on Saturdays

not by law, but because the community wants it so, and the authorities cooperate. Community, as opposed to individuality, has a much higher standing in Israel than America because of its socialist beginnings. 

The other two are correct, but like for the pigs there are various ways around it without violating the law. 

Think of it like blue laws in the United States.
 




 Subtle? They kept the camera on his face for five whole seconds! 




 As you can see by the phrase "he who says, " this is about people who are publicly claiming such, not about those who want privately believe. 

 




  Gamers won because we have the power, as long as we're not pushovers

Just like we're winning with Greenlight, Early access, shitty mobile apps, and microtransactions, right? 




 You have a good point. I'll sleep on this. Does paying a small minimum amount not change your mind at all? 




 I'm trying to compose a plan to keep the modding community alive for TES6. It's not not a guarantee that we'll have one, you know, 




 But what if Nexus could expand more? Improve the interface, make a better mod manager, etc. What if the modder decided what percentage Nexus gets? 




 I have 100+ mods myself for both Skyrim and Morrowind, so I get what you're saying!

I didn't include it because I thought this was implicit: we're trying to keep the modding community as open and collaborative as possible while preparing for the inevitable paid mod scheme. Hopefully, there will be a few great mods behind the paywall, while the rest will be free; but to do that, donations need to become more of a norm when downloading. If for every 100 downloads, $1 donation is given, many people will make a not insubstantial amount of money.

That's also why I think there should be so many limitations for the paid mods. That shitty armor pack shouldn't be allowed as a paid mod, nor the fancy sword from Dota. The ones allowed in the marketplace will already be good and useful. SkyRe, or something like it, is something I could potentially see being there if the modder wanted it to. But the minimum should be about 25 cents, not a dollar, and for payment a sliding scale like humble bundle, or an area where you manually enter what you pay, is implemented.

I want there to be a community for the TES6, which I fear there won't be if crap paid mods will immediately flood the place. 




 But we underestimated the differences between our previously successful revenue sharing models, and the addition of paid mods to Skyrim's workshop. We understand our own game's communities pretty well, but stepping into an established, years old modding community in Skyrim was probably not the right place to start iterating. We think this made us miss the mark pretty badly, even though we believe there's a useful feature somewhere here.

Nothing there about Bethesda's games not having paid mods in the future, and they still think there is a useful feature. The only way there won't be paid mods is if Bethesda says no, which I don't believe they have.

The Nexus has donations nailed down. Why are you trying to help them take a cut? 

Because a better Nexus means a counter to the inevitable monetized Steam workshop. Plus, a donation to the mod creator should include some to the mod hoster.

 




 Do you have a source for the Arab immigration? It's a common statement in right-wing Zionist circles, and I've been trying to find one for a while. 




 We can't change the negativity that happened, but I hope we can get something positive out of it. /u/xaliber_skyrim is trying to compile a extensive list of everything that was wrong[ in the stickied thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/343jtf/your_voices_were_heard/cqr1041).

My opinion is that paid mods are an inevitability we need to prepare for. [I made another thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/343ym0/paid_mods_are_coming_whether_we_like_it_or_not/) where we can discuss how a paid mod scheme might actually work so that it won't destroy the community. 




 I made a discussion to preempt it [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/343ym0/paid_mods_are_coming_whether_we_like_it_or_not/) 




  and it should be modeled after the humble-bundles.

Can you explain how, exactly? 




 Your welcome! I think we also need a compilation of what exactly went wrong, but that is not what I'm focusing on.

ods and other "industry practices" to allow this.
I'm new to the modding community, which means I only started playing Morrowind a year ago and Skyrim over the last six months. But like people have been saying a lot, recent events have inspired me to give back. As I have next to no money and not enough time to learn to mod extensively (even though I played around with it a bit in Morrowind), I was thinking about what's going to happen in the future. I realized two things:

1. Paid mods are coming, no matter how much we protest. The Valve press release was pretty clear about that. 
2. Next time around, there won't be a community uproar at nearly the same scale. The Skyrim modding community is the biggest we have, another one won't be established by the time the next game is released. We can't stop the hundreds of thousands from buying the next Bethseda game, even if it is announced with paid mods. 

Since we can't stop paid mods arriving, I think the best solution is to preemptively speak as a community to Valve and Bethesda about what we *do* want. Reading around the forums, I've noticed most people don't have a problem with paid mods **in theory**, as long as several key conditions are met. However, the implementation this time around was abysmal and we all realized nothing but slow (or not so slow) decline of mods would come from it. 

So I have a radical idea. I think we should compile a list of the many sins that were committed, the problems they would cause, and improvements that would need to occur next time. We can present these to Valve/Bethesda as demands for the community to reluctantly support, or at least not condemn, paid mods. By conditioning our support on several key demands, we can make sure Valve sets up a marketplace that does not set off the disastrous effects we fear. Both parties would benefit: Since we can't stop paid mods, we could turn them into something which will have neutral or maybe even beneficial effects. Bethesda won't get the inevitable PR hit next time around, which is fresh in their minds right now and so holds the most power.

I've started small list below, and I think it would be great for the community to put together a comprehensive list and make it as official as possible. Hopefully this will be an opportunity to bring us together after the recent bitterness.

Here's my start, from what I've seen people saying. 

Issues:

1. The way the marketplace was set up encouraged crap shovelware micro transactions over good mods.
2. There is no good way to test a mod and return it if it doesn't work.
3. There is no way to make sure that the modder will continue supporting the mod through main game updates and other mod changes. 
4. Mods use one another assets all the time, which makes monetizing them a legal quagmire. In addtion, relying on modders and the community to police stolen assets in unworkable.
5. The paltry 25% the modders got was absolutely ridiculous.
6. The secrecy of the implementation runs counter to how the modding community functions.
7. Most of us using mods don't use the Workshop because of its limited functionality, meaning we can't access the mods posted like SkyUI 5.0.

Solutions: 

**Quality**

/u/DiamondMind: A paid mod being on the marketplace means that the developer has endorsed it as unofficial DLC for the game and guarantee it. This legitimizes the cut they take and gives them a stake to supervise which mods have their name attached. 

/u/DavidJCobb: All mods must have a seven day return policy, no questions asked and no consequences.

/u/BullZEye22: Mods should gather a certain amount of approval before they can be sold.

/u/fadingsignal: Behind the scenes, there should be a partially dedicated faster-response support team for mod authors. If a mod is having trouble because the Steam downloader is screwing it up, or there is abuse or stolen assets being used, someone who is a verified author should have a slightly elevated support level, so they can in turn better support their customers who purchase their mods.

**User convenience**

/u/DavidJCobb: Load order managers and mod managers are essential to using mods while keeping one's game stable, but Skyrim doesn't natively support these tools, and the average Steam user won't know much about them. This is quite possibly the largest barrier to modding. Bethesda must develop their own analogues to LOOT and MO/NMM, and integrate these directly into the PC versions of FO4 and TES6.

Authors should be permitted to upload full archives, rather than a BSA/ESP pairing (the current limitation), but the uploading of loose files should be discouraged, and some sort of warning should be indicated to the user in the Steam Workshop's UI.

/u/DiamondMind: Do not tie downloads into the workshop; allow them to be used like Nexus files. That way, Bethesda and other developers do not need to create their own tool and force us all to use it. 

/u/fadingsignal: Fix the Steam Downloader to be actually useful.

**Compensation**

For Paid Mods:

Modders need to get at least 50% of the sale. Valve and the publisher can work out how to split the other 50% on their own. There are more than enough differences between mods and other "industry practices" to allow this.

/u/fadingsignal: Option to set the minimum price to $0


For Unpaid Mods:

/u/NeuroticNyx: A donation button for unpaid mods on the Steam Workshop. No profit form Bethesda can be made from this, as it is not endorsed.

/u/MaryMudpie: A system of Pay-What-You-Want for all mods. (Probably not going to happen.)

/u/EggheadDash: A pop for a donation once the game is closed, with Yes/Remind me Later/No options.

**Compatibility patches**

Modders should be permitted to create compatibility patches between mods even when one of the mods is paid, so long as the compatibility patches don't use any resources from any of the original mods (including the paid one(s)) without their authors' permissions. Users should not be permitted to sell compatibility patches; they should remain free. This should rather neatly solve the community's concerns about the interoperability of paid mods; if a paid mod is good enough, I guarantee you that some industrious user will build a patch to make it work.


**Limitations on sale**

/u/DavidJCobb Mod authors should not be permitted to sell bugfixes for base game content, official DLC, or any other mods. These must be free. Obviously this policy must be worded in such a manner as to permit a mod author to continue selling a mod even if they must later release a bugfix for it; yet to forbid that author from releasing the bugfix itself as a separate paid product.

/u/DiamondMind: UI and other "fixes," not just bugs, should also never be sold.

Perhaps there should also be a lower limit on the content sold so that microtransactions like adding a sword aren't allowed.

**Theft**

If a mod author's resources are stolen and used in a paid mod, that author should be able to report that to Valve and have it acted on promptly. The thief's revenue should be transferred to the original author; or, if the author doesn't have payment details registered with Steam, the full amount should be held in escrow indefinitely, without a time limit, until it can be transferred to the original author.

In particular, we need assurances that Valve will pay attention to content that was originally uploaded to other sites, or at least to the more notable ones, when investigating theft reports. The full details of their policies regarding theft should be made public.

**Transparency**

Speak to us every step of the way, and release a prototype version first that we can check for issues.


This is of course unfinished, and there a lot more problems to address. Comment and I'll add it to the list!
