 Who wouldn't want to watch episodes named Antipasti, Minestrone, Pane, Pizza (highest rated episode ever), Spaghetti and for season finale, Tiramisu.
 













































































































 This accusation coming from Wendy got me thinking, what if Kendal isn't innocent and was telling (partially) the truth? This is by far the most diskish move by Raylan and he's willing to put a manipulated boy (guilty or not) 40 years in prison just to get his chance at his big brother. And if he didn't do it? "Well, that makes it worse". 



















 Let's say I use Arc with 40% chance of shock (10% from gem + 10% from quality + 20% from passive nodes). If I link Chain to it, I hit more enemies, and have better chance to trigger shock. However, Chain also reduces the damage considerably. If I understand this correctly, shock has a minimum duration that is derived from damage. So less damage means less duration, and if the duration is below the required minimum, shock won't trigger. 

Can anybody shed a light on this subject?

 I'm currently using Moon+ Reader Pro for reading, and I'm happy with it, but I never found the speed reading to be very useful. 

I've just read this [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1yvvam/software_that_speeds_up_your_reading_to_500_words/) and I thought maybe I'll give other apps another shot.

My requirements are: ability to open any epub/mobi book on the device, speed settings, and one-sentence-at-a-time UI.

Thanks!

 On the face of it, House of Cards is another political drama, telling the story of one congressman on his way to gain power. I usually hate this kind of television, telling us how great government is and how people with opposite views learn to come and work together. However, this show arguably provides the best criticism today on government and politics in their current form.

Nobody on the show cares about the public, and everybody's working out of self-preservation, narrow political interests, ego and selfishness. 

Bills, projects, acts, executive orders and such, are all introduced, executed, canceled, supported or opposed based on the political points, and almost never on 'what is right for the people'. It shows how people with political power can crash regular people and businesses standing in their way.

The writing is almost always cynic. Phrases like 'I have no ulterior motive here' are always there to hide something else. 

There's also some nice criticism on representative democracy. Season 1/2 **spoiler**: When the congressman sworn to VP (replacing the existing one), he looks at the camera and say: 'One heartbeat away from the presidency, and not a single vote cast in my name. Democracy is so overrated.'

Another nice touch is that the anti-hero is a democrat. So most of the people who abuses power and deceives are from the left.

Anyway, besides the criminal aspect of the story (which I think can be regarded as fiction and not a true demonstration of politicians) the entire system is pained in very unflattering colors.

 Here's something the bugs my mind. Let's say your country descend (ascend?) into anarchy. Who should take over the parks, roads, rivers, sea and other public areas?

Private hands, sure, but the way I see it, everyone has a right to this stolen land, and everyone can claim ownership of it. So who'll get it? 










































































 If you are waiting for a particular deal on an item or just want to see the daily deal in your rss reader without checking the website everyday, here are instructions on how to it.

First, create RSS feed from the daily deal page. To do that, go to a site called [feed43](http://feed43.com/). It's free and no need to sign up. Click [Create your own feed](http://feed43.com/feed.html?action=new).

Step 1. 

Put in the page address: https://www.pathofexile.com/shop/category/daily-deals and click reload.

Step 2. 

Leave the first box empty (Global Search Pattern).

Put the following [text](http://pastebin.com/S3z7v82C) in the second box (Item Search Pattern):

    img class="itemImage" src="{%}"{*}/{*}h1 class="name"{%}/h1{*}div class="description"{%}/div{*}div class="label"{%}/div{*}div class="value"{%}/div{*}div class="totalCost"{%}/div

Click Extract.

Step 3.

Fill the properties:

* Feed Title: Path of Exile - Daily Deal RSS
* Feed Link: https://www.pathofexile.com/shop/category/daily-deals
* Feed Description: Path of Exile - Daily Deal RSS
* Item Title Template: {%2}
* Item Link Template: https://www.pathofexile.com/shop/category/daily-deals

Item content Template:

    
    {%2} - {%3}/br/br{%4}{%5}. strongDaily Deal: {%6}/strong/br/brimg src="{%1}"/

This is an [image](http://i.imgur.com/kMzdLJ4.png) of how step 3 looks like.


Click Preview and you are done. You can now take the feed URL and use it in your favorite RSS reader.

*Just a quick note: the reason I'm not sharing my feed (and neither should you) is because feed43 limits the pull requests to few hundreds a day. More than 500/hour will get the IP banned.*

*Also, this feed will break if/when GGG changes their html layout. I hope it won't happen often.*


Now that you have the feed and you want to create an email alert, you can use a service called [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/myrecipes/personal/new). There are some straight forward steps to create what they call a recipe. Simply choose **Feed** as a trigger - New Feed Item Matches - Keyword: put the item you are waiting for, like "Black Cat Pet", Feed: put the URL from feed43. - Create Trigger - Email - your email information.

That's it. Hope you found it helpful. 





























 I see that many are asking about ways to evaluate items and decide which to keep and which to vendor. So I'm sharing my personal Excel spreadsheet. It's fast and gives a good snapshot about any Rare item.

First, here's a [screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/l3grWX6.png). And here's an [album](http://imgur.com/a/3aXcp) with more examples (but I'm going to use the first screenshot in my explanation below)

To use the excel, simply copy the item data in the game (Hover item, click Ctrl+C), then go to the spreadsheet and click the button. No need to paste, that's what the button does.
___
**Here's what you get** 
___

~~ The left table is straight forward and contains all the information about the item.

~~ The top-right table displays all the mods. 

* The rank column shows how the **minimum** range of the roll is ranked within the possible rolls. In the example above, *74% increased Energy Shield* is rank #3, because according to [poemods](http://www.poemods.com/index.php?item_type=helmet)   [PoE mods compendium](http://poetools.com/mods-compendium/), the possible rolls for % increase ES in helmet are:

iLvl|range|description
--|--|--
72 | 101 to 120 |(Unconquerable)
60 | 83 to 100 |(Dauntless)
44 | 65 to 82 |(Fearless)
30 | 47 to 64 |(Resolute)
18 | 29 to 46 |(Strong-Willed)
3 | 11 to 28 |(Protective)

So this roll is ranked #3 on the list. Obviously you want to see ranks 1 or 2.

* You can also notice that 2 mods are shaded. those are the 'sought-after' mods. It's not easy to compile a full list, so I did it just the basics:

If the mod contains: | with value above:
--|--
any Resistance	|20
all Elemental Resistance|	10
maximum Life|	60
maximum Mana|	40
increased Energy Shield|	60
increased Armour|	60
increased Evasion Rating|	60
Movement Speed|	20
increased Rarity|	15
increased Quantity|	15
+ to Gems level|	1
+ to Dex/Str/Int|	30
increased Spell Damage|	20

*If you have some knowledge in Excel, you'll be able to update this list, extend it and modify it to your needs*

~~ The middle right table displays the basic properties of the items.

* Here you'll see two ranks. The first is the rank of the item in the entire category, based on [the official list by GGG](http://www.pathofexile.com/item-data). So in the example above, this helmet is #21 on the list (where #1, [Lion Pelt](http://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Lion_Pelt), is the best white helmet in the game).

* The second rank is how the item is within its armour specific category. Since the helmet in the example is ES, you want to know how it is ranked within the pure ES category (where [Hubris Circlet](http://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Hubris_Circlet) is considered the #1 helmet). In this example, the helmet is just the 4th best so don't bother with it.

**You want to see items ranked #1 or #2**

*Note: the second rank is only valid to armour. Weapons have just a single category (ranks within wand, staff, 2H axe, etc.)*

~~ Finally, the bottom right table displays the Armour/Attack values and the implicit mods (Armour, Evasion, ES, Phy Damage, Ele Damage, etc)

* For Armour, the following rolls will get marked:

Armour Stats	| Level 1 | Level 2	
--|--|--
Evasion Rating	|800	|1000
Armour	|800	|1000
Energy Shield	|160	|200

**You want to look at those marked level 2**

____

**So what items should you keep?**
____

You want to keep items that have:

1. 2-3 desirable mods
2. Rolls are ranked #1
3. Item is ranked 1-2 within its category
4. The basic stats of the items are level 2 (end game)

About pricing (Domination): Don't get your hopes up. Items usually go for 1 chaos top (rarely 2-3, unless you got some exceptional luck with 4-5 desirable mods, no stupid mods, and high level). Especially if you found them in maps level 72 or less. My recommendation: if an item is in your stash for more than a week, lower the price to 1 alch, if it doesn't go, vendor it and move on. **Good items disappear almost instantly**, so if it's not selling, don't wait.

____

**Batch Mode (!)**
____

If you got this far you probably be happy to know that the spreadsheet supports batch evaluation. Here's how you do it. 

1. Install [this AHK script](http://pastebin.com/W76rk74T).

2. Copy the first item as usual (Ctrl+C)

3. Now go over the rest of the items and click Ctrl+Shift+C. If the item is rare, the data will be added to the clipboard (and not replace it)

4. After you copied up to 10 items, go to the spreadsheet and click the button

5. Now you can use the [up/down arrows](http://i.imgur.com/RZiQ8L0.png) to circle quickly through the items

____

**Download**
____

You can get it from my [dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/kd9sbxj9zt8xanv/Path%20of%20Exile%20-%20Item%20Eval%20v1.0.xlsm).

Final notes:

* Please don't expect something perfect. It's meant for personal use. 
* Some less common mods are not mapped. 
* Some mods are overlapping (1H/2H/etc). So you might see double readings. 
* I mostly concentrated on Armour and not Weapons. 
* You gonna need Excel 2010, macro enabled (click enable content when prompted). 
* If it's not working for you, or if you have questions on how to expend it and add different values, feel free to pm me.

 New books in Israel are published with a cover price of about $25. You probably think thats too expensive for a book. You are correct. So did the readers in Israel. 

The retail market is dominated by two major chains (have about 80% market share together). In order to compete and sell more books, they started selling them in bundles. Prices dropped constantly, until it settled at 4 books for $30. Thats right, about  of the cover price.

At that point book writers complained that because of the power the publishers have over their contracts, they barely make any money from books sales. 

Writers are paid about 10% of the paid price. So less than $1 for a book. In a very small Hebrew reading market. A best-seller book sells for about 50K copies in 2-4 years span.

Then the government decided to intervene and save the day.
The parliament passed a law last year saying that new books cannot be sold at a discount for the first year. Thats right. The arbitrary number the published picked cannot be changed by the retail seller.

The law came into effect this February. 3 months ago. Thats it.
The situation became dire very quickly. 

Books sales drastically dropped. One of the 2 retail chains is in financial troubles, stopped paying suppliers and will probably declare bankruptcy soon. Publishers stopped signing unknown writers. New books became expensive again, publishers and stores willing to bet on well-known writers only. Some publishers stated they are on the way to close the business. Most of the books that are sold now (75%) are those published before the law took effect and can be sold at deep discount. Independent and small book stores almost dont sell any new books now.

Some customers are saying that 4 books for $30 is too cheap. They say that a book is a cultural item that shouldnt be sold in a deep discount. The say writers should be able to make a living. They got lawmakers on their side, because supporting writers is the noble thing to do.

Well, the market proved them otherwise. 
 


























































































































































 Only now I found out there are two more episodes. I'm very pleased with that too. 


























































































































































 Edit: just adding a bit of a content here, as I never meant it to be love/hate post.

I like the Heat, they are playing my kind of basketball. But I never thought of them as a *steady* team (as opposed to another favorite team of mine, the Spurs, which surprisingly, never even made it twice in a row), so I was surprised to learn that fact today.

I'm not big on basketball history before 88-89, so I can't compare this team to 82 Lakers or 84 Celtics (those are just blurred memories of NBA games I watched as a child, in which the cool kids liked the Celtics, don't ask me why).

Also, I don't think the east is particularly weak in the past 4 years compared to the past 15-20 years. In fact, it looks much stronger. But I may be wrong here.

Anyway, they still got 2 wins to go, and this stat implying it's really not that straight forward to go over this hump. 
































































































































































































































 I'm pretty happy with my build right now, and I want to create it again in the next league. Is there a way to keep a snapshot of it for future reference without fearing the next tree will break the paths?  



























































 I always create a group before going into maps (i farm masters, so I want to share it PA) - the group is created **public**. I cannot change it to private until someone joins. Why is that? it doesn't make sense. 

Also, when the last person (besides me) leaves or even if I kick the last person - the group closes (sometimes it doesn't, I haven't figured out when) and I need to create a new one. Why is that? 

I should be able to create a perma private group. 





























 And 7+ masters should spawn rare areas (up to 6 mods). 














 I'm trying to use life formula to match my actual number, and I'm coming short. 

According to the wiki:

     Life = (38 + (Level * 12) + (Strength / 2) + additive modifiers) * (100% + multiplicative modifiers)

On the gear I have +288 life and +36% to max life (Belly of the Beast). Per PoEBuilder I have +20/+138% from the tree.

So the calculation coming up as:

    Life = (38 + (86 * 12) + (213 / 2) + 20 + 288) * (100% +36% + 138%) =   4067

My life is just over 4200, so where am I missing 200 HP?
 
























 Preferably wrapped up in a GroupBox. Any hints and ideas? Thanks. (PS reading the files isn't the issue here, just the dynamically adding buttons inside a groupbox)

Update. Okay so basically I create those 2 functions, and I think it will work for me (the variables are self explanatory - x,y,w,h and some margins in between):


    add_group(group_number, group_name)
    {
    	global
    	group_y := (group_number - 1) * group_h + 10 
    	Gui, Add, GroupBox, xm ym+%group_y%  Section w%group_w% h%group_h% , %group_name%
    }

    add_button_to_group(sub_name, caption, is_first=false)
    {
    	global
    	if (is_first)
    	{
    		Gui, Add, Button,  xs+%gui_m% 			ys+%gui_m% w%gui_w%  h30 g%sub_name% , %caption%
    	}
    	else
    	{
    		Gui, Add, Button,  xp+%gui_w_margin% 	ys+%gui_m% w%gui_w%  h30 g%sub_name% , %caption%
    	}
    }

To use it, I simply call:

    add_group(1,"Shortcuts #1") 
    add_button_to_group("RunSomething1", "Name #1", true)

    add_group(2,"Shortcuts #2")
    add_button_to_group("RunSomething2", "Name #2", true)
    add_button_to_group("RunSomething3", "Name #3" )

 I just downloaded it and gave it a try, the things I'm missing are:

* Is there a slideshow mode? in BaconReader I can view the post full screen (image, webpage, etc) and then slide right to the next one. Very convenient for image focused subs. Couldn't find this option here.
*  When clicking on a post on the front page, I get directly to the post content. Is there a way to get directly to the comments (skipping the slide up part)?
* Is there a way to collapse all comments by default?
* I have some subs I view often, but I don't want to subscribe to them. So I added them manually without subscribing, that's cool - just like BR. However when I sync my subs, the new ones were deleted. Is it a bug?

Thanks. The app looks great.

 Bob Dylan always had this anti establishment side in him. 

Obama on meeting Bob Dylan:

 Heres what I love about Dylan: He was exactly as youd expect he would be. He wouldnt come to the rehearsal; usually, all these guys are practicing before the set in the evening. He didnt want to take a picture with me; usually all the talent is dying to take a picture with me and Michelle before the show, but he didnt show up to that. He came in and played The Times They Are A-Changin. A beautiful rendition. The guy is so steeped in this stuff that he can just come up with some new arrangement, and the song sounds completely different. Finishes the song, steps off the stage  Im sitting right in the front row  comes up, shakes my hand, sort of tips his head, gives me just a little grin, and then leaves. And that was it  then he left. That was our only interaction with him. And I thought: Thats how you want Bob Dylan, right? You dont want him to be all cheesin and grinnin with you. You want him to be a little skeptical about the whole enterprise. So that was a real treat.  




 But studios are exactly that! They are *active* VC that specialized in music and also have connections to help the business they invest in. What he means is that he's looking for *passive* investors. But that's gonna be a very risky business to be in.

 Have you ever seen art students or amateur artists sitting in a museum im front of a panting, trying to draw it? You are saying they aren't allowed to do that. That I can't draw at home Le Reve and hang it on my wall. That if I can buy parts and build a Mustang, I'm not allowed to do that and put it in my yard. 

That I can't take a guitar, play Stairway to Heaven and keep the recording. Because someone owns those sound waves and I can't move the air on the same way without paying him.

I'm not sure I agree with that. 




 Here's a case for this being a 'right'.

You buy a pencil, you buy paper. You can draw on that paper whatever you want with your pencil. It's your property, it's your right.

You have 5 rooms in your house, you can turn them on and off in any way you like. You can light 2 rooms or 4 rooms. It's your house, your light, your right.

You have a harddrive with billions of bits. You can turn them on and off any way you want. It's your HD, your bits, your pc. BUT if you arrange your bits in a sequence that is similar (not even identical) to a song or a movie or a book, you suddenly break the law and it's not right anymore. Change the first bit, you are golden, change the 10th bit, immoral.

Digital copyright is basically saying someone owns that sequence of bits. Someone owns a number, and you can't copy that number.

 




 Why not switch to digital? Who owns the copyright?

 Kodak can be the opposite example. And anyway, I'm not saying the company will fail, but they can be merged with another big company (let's say, for the sake of argument, LG or Samsung mobile) and call themselves somthing else.  




 But Microsoft doesn't need to be replaced. It can be merged, split or rebrand for the name to be forgotten. We are talking 50 years here, that's eternity in tech terms.

The name Microsoft doesn't have much value. It's not even a popular website or a product (vs. Windows, Office and such). 




 Why is that? 




 You are counting moves, where most of those calculations are referring to *boards* or *games*. You can move your piece backward and forward, but you still have the same board.

 I think a case can be made for Dr Who. First, it's an old show. Even the new seasons have that old vibe. I'm not saying it's bad in any way (nor do the millions of fans need my opinion). I'm saying that a modern US show will lool and feel very different. Second, the style of Dr is kinda cartoonish, where US television brings more realistic production. I don't know if it will be better, but it will sure be different.

 I watched the movie with my gf, she fell asleep in the middle. So when it ended I went to bed depressed and sad and I couldn't even talk about it. On the next day she watched the second half of the film, so I joined her because it's just a fantastic movie. I got sad again by the end, somehow I was hoping that maybe I didn't get it right the first time. Damn.  




 But there isn't 'infinite amount of times'. It's a finite number, we just don't know it. Most importantly, we don't know the ratio between that number and the chance of creating life.

 Yeah, but there's no reasom to hide that, people know the story. It's like in the tv series Hannibal. They don't hide the fact (from the viewer) that he's a serial killer, because most people know that.  




 Yeah, maybe. I think it depends a lot on the native format in which the book was published. Usually bettet to leave it at that format than convert it. 




 Also, after you deDRM it, don't convert to pdf, just install calibre on your laptop. PDF is a lousy format for books.

 Cas as tank, Viv supports, IB damage.  




 Biggest mistake was not using voice acting and let it play in the background while the player moves on. With a AAA budget, I doubt that would have add more than a friction to the costs, but would have added a lot to the experience.  




 I'm gonna upvote you, but no way I'm opening that link. 




 Typing: A bit of a 3 way. Thinking: not impressive enough. Adding: Kinda 4 way. 




 It reminds me of a chart that was published a year ago, about winning actors' average age being much higher than actresses' age. Kind of the same issue. However, im both cases it's a matter of public taste, so if anybody's really bored with their life and want to fill it with some shallow meaning, they should direct it to movies watchers and not the Oscars. 




 Yeah, people seem to forget it's about 2 guys, going to work everyday and doing their job. 




 Of course polygamy should be available to any adults who want it. All other technical issues (inheritance, taxes, etc) should be changed to support that. Too bad it's not a popular concept these days. Popular, as in very few people want to form this kind of family, but those who do, suffer greatly from this discrimination.  




 TIL: when some famous dude found out about some stuff he said some clever shit.

Repeat.  




 Well, to be fair, $ spent now is usually more than a $ spent over time. In the current rates environment that's probably another cent off. 




 literally /r/humblebrag   




 The scales have fallen away from your eyes. You can see you now. 









  ... and when it was eventually over ...

Sounds like he's talking about LOTR extended edition marathon and not sex. 




 Which is still better for him than the other night, when everybody called him Rapey McRapesalot. 




 You just made OP hold his head again. 




 ...yet. Tape measure snakes claim hundreds of victims every year.  




 Actually, as funny as those are, most of them do happen at one point or another. It just ends with 'shit, well, I should pay more attention next time' and not 'shit, I should buy something now on TV to stop it'. 




 That's why the first person to try to detach them during fire will get third degree burns in the hands. 




 If they drove in opposite directions, it means that was a head on collision. This is never a small matter and there's usually enough damage to justify an insurance claim. Exchanging insurance details is not being a dick, it's just getting money from **your insurance** to cover the damages **you need to fix**, that's what you pay them for.

Or, maybe it was bumper collision, no damage, and one of them just remember he forgot something at home and had to turn back. 




 you cant even 




 I didn't see even one action tv show that pulls the baby right. It's usually just a prop, appearing and disappearing when it fits the plot. 




 Like Chris Rock puts it: there's a different between being rich and being wealthy. Shaq is rich. The white dude who writes him his paycheck is wealthy.  




 Some people don't want to kill the fish. They just really want it to be late somewhere.       -- Mitch 




 Yes. Also, Hannibal in *the Silence of the Lambs* didn't age very well in my opinion. It looks a bit of a cliche now. Not to his fault. It's more like a [Seinfeld Is Unfunny](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny) trope. So starting with the TV series is better.  




 I would say because it isn't funny, but that never was an issue at /r/funny. 




 Are we sure it's for consumption? Can the human body digest grass? [Why Can't We Live On Grass?](http://www.scienceshorts.com/Ssw/060617.htm) [Why Can't Humans Eat Grass?](http://www.livescience.com/32435-why-cant-humans-eat-grass.html). Looks like it's edible but not providing anything to the body. 




 Again? damn, this girl can't hold on to a job. No wonder she has to hack to websites to get hired time and time gain. 




 You know your West Wing stuff, but you forgot something. If you watch that episode again, right after the credits, you'll see: based on true future story. 




 Close, but not exactly. Even if you have a valid visa, or a passport from a country with no visa requirements, you still can be flagged and stopped at the border. Again, without providing any explanation to you. You'll be kept in an airport holding facility until travel arrangements back will be arranged. 




 They take DNA for the same reason they take fingerprints and photo for anyone arrested. They keep it for the record and for future crimes. It's for identity purposes, not for immediate analysis.  




  you kick me out of math class  
Now I'm gonna relatively slap your ass ./  
(time 75 min) 




 I love it that someone who really knows shit about shit like Musk responds with: "I'm not sure I am [super genius]". 

This is something that those who claim to be smart never understand: the more you learn, and the smarter you become, you also become more humble and realize how little you know compared to others and to what there is to know. 




 Step 1: she doesn't think I want sex  
Step 2: She let me get close to get quickly  
Step 3: "Just to let everybody know, me and Dan aren't dating! I repeat aren't dating! He's my bff and I'll do anything for him, but we aren't dating. 3 you Dan, I wish I could find someone like you"  
[Step 4](http://i.imgur.com/HbwHN0T.jpg) 




 Good luck making costumes, and being a nanny, and making home videos... speaking of which... would you direct me in the way to see them? putting it bluntly at least. 









 Thanks, I decided to skip it. The show is coming soon anyway, and if history is any guide, it will be over 3 days after. 




 I totally get it. As an amateur writer, by the time I finish writing a story, even a short one, not only that I don't enjoy reading it, I straight out hate it.  




 It does. That's for another story though. 




 "Find this little trick that makes reposters hate him!" 














 Twist: OP knew it's a movie, but Tumblr just don't like Platoon and think it's an overrated movie and a good excuse to hate America's film industry circa 1985. 









 Thought creates reality crap. I remember a scene, probably from that movie, about a guy who is %100 POSITIVE that if he thinks about a parking spot, he'll always find one when he needs it.

Have you ever dc and wanted to continue your conversation or PM the group, but you didn't know their handles? 

As some of you know, PoE keeps chat logs, among other stuff, in a file called client.txt. I wrote a simple script that reads this file (from the end, because it can be very large), and displays them in 4 separate tabs: global, private, group and trade. 

Notes:

* Download the pastebin file, save as .ahk and run. You'll need AutoHotKey 1.1 and above.
* Default client.txt path is  *C:\Program Files (x86)\Grinding Gear Games\Path of Exile\logs\Client.txt* - this can be changed in the script to match your installation settings.
* Default number of characters to read (from the end of the file) is 50000. This can also be changed. bigger number will give more chat messages but longer reading time.
* client.txt should be bigger than that number.

Have fun, and I hope you'll find it useful.  












































 This league I decided to make it more challenging for me and try to be self found only. 

Usually my strategy so far was to pick and use gear up until A3M (group rushing the major bosses in cruel), and get to City of Sarn underleveled and undergeared. At this point I farm currency, adding up to what I already have and get basic gear to carry me through A3M and low level maps (life/es/res).

Alright, so I hit A3M 2 days ago, and I also hit a wall. For the life of me, I couldn't find any decent gear in the past 2 days farming Docks. My resists were around 0%, and obviously you can't survive much like that. 

As much I love this challenge, about an hour ago, I gave up, spent about 8c and got all the gear I need for now.

So after my failed attempt, I really wonder how you do it? how long does it take? did you have any luck so far this league? Do you do it for the challenge or do you just hate trading?

 









 eztv.it was an ideal tv torrent site. Are there any comparable alternatives now that it's down post raid?

The main distinctive feature of the site was that each tv show is listed just once, verified, with different sources to the same torrent. Anything else like that out there? 




 I'm looking for something that will be the hardest to kill up until 75 maps - no Atziri and DPS is less of a priority. Any suggestions? 




 ...Lyrical_ is the first character to enter Palace.

I really don't get how, but it's very impressive. 




 First, a major issue was fixed/set-right: if your default allocation is set to Permanent, and you open a new instance (solo) - the area's allocation will be set to Permanent. Great.

However, I did notice that group's allocation tend to change. We played Graveyard is was PA, went into the cave - it was changed to SA. Same with dock runs. Maybe it's because the leader changed, maybe the first person who entered into the instance. I'm no sure, but I do believe it's happening.

Am I wrong here?

 Gallery mode is when media is displayed 100% width/height of the browser windows (or full screen), other text is gone except title. Back/Forward (or space) jumps to the next media. Other keyboard shortcuts can be used to upvote/downvote/hide (and automatically advance), open comments, etc.

There are some external sites that provide that for Reddit, but none is very good and most don't integrate well with Reddit (voting, saving, hiding, etc.), plus they require credentials which is less secure. 

I think it would be a good and useful addition to RES. 









 If you are unfamiliar with Peaky Blinders, it's a British (BBC2) crime series, about a gang family in Birmingham, England post WWI. The cast includes Cillian Murphy in the leading role (Scarecrow from Nolan's Batman), Sam Neill (Jurassic Park) and is joined by Tom Hardy (Inception, Batman's Bane, Locke) in the second season. 

The soundtrack has tracks by:

* Nick Cave (theme song and through out the series)
* The White Stripes and Jack White
* The Raconteurs
* Tom Waits
* Dan Auerbach
* The Dead Weather
* Johnny Cash
* PJ Harvey
* Arctic Monkeys

 I'm eating right now a superb sweet potato and lentil dish.

1. In a slow cooker, put 3 peeled, cut in chunks sweet potatoes. Carrots and 2 cups of lentils.
2. In a small skillet, heat oil, put some chopped onions. Add some spices: curry, cumin, salt, pepper, ginger root, garlic. Mix. Add 2 cups of chicken broth, stir for a minute and pour everything into the slow cooker.
3. Put on low heat for 6 hours.
4. If you have green beans, add them now, let it cook for another hour.

The recipe is based on that [one](http://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes/slow-cooker-curried-sweet-potato-and-lentil-stew/841c60f3-3a01-4dec-bc31-c3e0c964a677), I just added more lentils and I prefer to saute onions before adding them to the cooker.

 Here's **Jamaican Jerk Chicken** from the book: *Slow Cooker Classics from Around the World*.

----

*Jerking is a method of seasoning and cooking meat that dates back to the Carib-Arawak Indians who inhabited Jamaica. Meat is marinated in a spicy pastelike sauce and then cooked slowly. Originally cooks would puncture the meat with a sharp object and stuff the holes with a variety of spices. The meat would then be cooked in a deep pit lined with stones over burning pimento (allspice) wood, which gave it a unique smoky flavor.*

----

#Ingredients

* 1 cup chopped sweet onions, like Vidalia
*  cup chopped scallions
* 1 teaspoon dried thyme or 2 teaspoons fresh thyme
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon black pepper
* 2 teaspoons sugar
* 1 teaspoon ground allspice
*  teaspoon ground nutmeg
*  teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 2 whole jalapeo peppers, sliced
* 3 tablespoons soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon canola oil
* 1 tablespoon cider vinegar
* 4 pounds cut-up chicken pieces, skin removed

#One day ahead

Place all ingredients except chicken in the bowl of a food processor. Puree, scraping down the sides of the bowl several times, until mixture is smooth. Place chicken in a large freezer-weight zipper bag. Pour marinade mixture into bag. Close bag and massage chicken so that all pieces are well coated with marinade. Refrigerate chicken in bag overnight.

#To cook

Remove chicken from marinade and place in a 4-quart slow cooker. Discard marinade. Cook on low setting for 3 hours, until chicken has cooked through but is not falling off the bone.

Preheat a gas grill to medium-hot, about 450F. Sear chicken for 2 minutes per side.

#To serve

Serve with steamed white rice or boiled fingerling potatoes.

----

*Jerk chicken usually calls for Scotch bonnet pepper, or the similar habanero. These are the hottest peppers in the capsicum family. I have lightened the spice in this recipe by using jalapeos, which are much milder. If you want to authenticate this recipe and love hot, hot, hot, substitute one scotch bonnet pepper for the jalapeos.*

 That can be a good argument by itself, but still, the context is grammatical in nature. 

 I paved a road, you created a business (pause) you didn't build **that**.

The question is what *that* refers to. The road or the business? If it's the business, then we can argue your point (can the carpenter claim he built the house?) but if *that* refers to the road, then there isn't any argument, because that statement is true. You didn't build the road, the government did, and you (maybe) paid taxes. 

Should have used **those**. 




 The irony is that he's using a made up story to convey a message against made up stories used to convey messages.

   survivors guilt could have easily convinced her that she 'must have known'

According to her statement, unless her memory made that up also, her father straight up told her what he's doing:

 He told me he killed girls.  
Again and again.  
So he wouldn't have to kill me.

Overall, when I rewatched season 1, I noticed that Abigail is portrayed (hinted) to be clever, distant, borderline sociopath and definitely hiding something (as Alana told Jack after first meeting her). I think this also explains why Hannibal was drawn to her so much. He knew what she's capable of. 

I think that the trauma made her forget the role the she played and the stuff she knew, but as the season progressed she became more self aware.

 I would have agreed with you, up until the final episode of the second season. [spoiler](#s "Gutting Will, arguably his best friend. Killed Abigail, which he seen like a daughter, in front of Will, which also loved her like his daughter. Stepped over Alana without even looking down, in which he had an affair for an entire season."). We usually see Villains do crazy shit to people they don't know, but this is really intimate level of evil.  




 Breaking Bad isn't *that* good. It's good entertainment, but I wouldn't put it in the best shows ever list. It's too calculated, too self aware and runs a very narrow story. 




 When he started the Tobacco topic, my first thought was "that's a beaten down topic, I mean, we all know the shit Tobacco companies pulled over the years". He then took it to an interesting place with nice angles I wasn't aware of (plain package, suing the governments, Africa). Well done. And the last bit with Jeff was brilliant.

 'Weapons dealer' doesn't mean much unless he consistently and knowingly sells weapons to bad people. Does he? (Asking because I don't know) 




 Of course not, don't get me wrong. Those aren't excuses at all. Those issues are the test, and it's obvious to me the US is failing most the tests it's facing. My point is that some countries almost aren't tested, and therefore shouldn't be scored, at least not on the same scale (and that's a good thing for them, really). 




 Could be, but then again, what are the challenges facing the press in Malta? Freedom of press is tested when the government has things to hide from the people. Wars, espionage, political scandals, unlawful conducts, corruption, riots and so on. Does Malta face any of that? (I'm asking out of ignorance) 




 People who are claiming short selling is unethical simply don't understand how the market works and what motivates the players.

1. You are saying that short selling "promotes the spreading of false information". Here's the thing, short seller are the only players - ONLY PLAYERS - with a motivation to spread bad news. Companies, long holders, brokers, stock exchange, politicians - all care about good news. All want to sugar coat everything. All want the stock market in all time high day in day out, as long as the inevitable fall won't happen while they hold the potato.   
Short seller play a huge roll in unearthing information.

2. Short sellers also stop down trends. They have an incentive to book profit. During panics, they are a major force that actually buy stocks (to cover). Short sellers only profit when they are back in the market as buyers (as oppose to long holders who hold assets and not necessarily have to sell to realize profits).

3. Short selling ban isn't effective. It was stated even by the fed: [Short-Selling Bans Failed to Prevent U.S. Stock Price Declines - Federal Reserve Bank of New York](http://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/news/research/2012/rp120810.html).

4. Short selling plays a huge roll in arbitrage trading and forcing many financial instruments to behave as they should. For example, the reason ETFs are trading close to the indices they follow is because of short selling. If a certain ETF opens a gap from its index, arbitrage players long one and short the other. Because of that mechanism, regular retail investors can buy ETFs without worrying too much.

 Alright, alright, alright 









 Well, they did mention that a big part of the feud was because of an incident between Dickie and Raylan when they were children. Raylan hit Dickie's knee with a baseball bat leaving him with a lame leg. So it's only fair that he shot his other leg when they grew up. Classic Raylan.

I don't think they tell what started it back in the prohibition era. 














 I agree with you, but you also need to consider that private charity will probably be more effective and more competitive. Still, not going to happen.  




  They just chat to dead characters who spew vague bullshit that rarely affects the narrative.

That's my main issue with hallucination scenes. I don't hate them, but they are so fucking predictable and boring. 

The hallucination is the Sopranos, after Tony was shot (season 6), was nicely done. It also lasted few episodes and had the right mix of nonsense and coherent plot.  




  They don't care, as long as production costs aren't incredibly high

The cost is only half of the equation. HBO cares about subscriptions. Their question is: does this show net generate or net eliminate subs? ratings, while giving some indication, don't answer that question. So in that sense, they don't care about them.  




 I also like to point out that numbers don't mean much without the overall trend (if homicide rate is [in decline for 2.5 decades](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/Number_of_murders_by_year_in_Chicago.png), then permits got nothing to do with that).

I guess infographic with arrows is catchy, but the questions should be: was the trend accelerated? was it reversed? are there other factors in play around the same time? did it stay the same *despite* other counter-factors? and so on. 

It's hard and almost impossible to isolate specific variables in large social systems like crime or economy.

 There's a reason for that. If you are a stranger in a strange land, you often feel strongly the illusion of freedom. Especially if you have money. It's easy to live when you are off the grid, ignored by the day-to-day burdens like taxes, health insurance, career choices, family, kids.

Edit: another thing I'd like to add is that in free countries we feel unfree mostly because of what we hear by the media. See news and browse the internet looking for freedom, and you'll feel oppressed and depressed within a week. The flip side of it is when you travel to another country and you simply don't know what's going on around you. The dude is visiting China, one of the largest countries in the world with 1.5 Billion people, he's amazed of all the new things he learned, where in fact, it's like going to a safari in Africa, standing by the entrance and say: this is bullshit, there aren't any lions here, why people are so afraid?

 I think that people aren't looking for scores. They are looking for recommendations, which don't necessarily have to come in a form of a number.  




 I'm afraid you misunderstood me. I'm not saying checks and balances are a good thing. And I'm not saying courts are needed. 

I'm talking about the definition of democratic. And if courts sit within that definition. 

Democracy, is a form of ruling in which the people chooses representatives every once in a while, and those representatives rule the people. That's not my definition. That's the scholar definition. And a very narrow one. So we can work with that. If you go by the even narrower definition of "rule of the people", then obviously even a parliamentary system isn't democratic. That's fine, but we should work off the same base.

Some democracies are direct. People actually vote on laws. Some of the democracies are of indirect form: representatives make laws. Some of the democracies have few degrees: representatives pick other representatives. For example, the people votes for parties, the parties form a government with a prime minister. The people didn't vote directly for the prime minister, but they trust their elected to do so.

Still, all those forms fall within the scholar definition of democracy (again, not my definition, that's really not that interesting).

What I'm saying is that courts are an extension of that process. Same as the police. I elect someone, that person appoints chief of police (so by proxy, it's like I made that appointment), that chief of police goes back and arrests the person who elected him - **because that's what I, the people, want**. All still working within the democratic framework. 

Court is like the central bank or the FDA or the military or sub-committees - all extensions of the government and, by the democratic process, of the people. The fact that its power is used as a balance is irrelevant. So that's where you missed my point.

If, for example, the supreme court was going from father to son, or was a private company with no obligation to the general public. I would have agreed with you - it's undemocratic. If a constitution is irreversible and cannot be amended - it's undemocratic. If the king or queen has any role, it's undemocratic. 

Also, just to add something real quick: the fact that in some countries, high courts are appointed to life, is obviously undemocratic.  




  Courts being able overturn legislation is by the definition of most scholars technically undemocratic.

I'm not sure about that. First, in many cases courts are appointed/approved by the an elected officials (or their representatives), so they are democratic by proxy. Second, courts interpret the law, which was also written by elected officials. They don't make up new laws. So that's again democratic. Third, they find contradictions between the law and the constitution. Meaning, they make sure the legislative branch is operating within the boundaries of the law (you can't rob someone, they can't make laws that contradict other laws).

There can be some exceptions here and there (just like a president or prime minister overusing executive power), but the overall structure is still inherently democratic.

 Okay, it's kind of a weird one. The husband is a high level manager in a weapon technology company. He and his wife relocated to Singapore for a couple of years to be his company's representative in the east. They lived really well over there. Just few months in, his wife got into coma. I really don't know the exact circumstances of that. She was treated there and he decided to stay (instead of moving back with her to his home country). He was able to get her mom a visa and flew her there also. 

A little more than a year passed, probably the longest year in his life,  and she woke up. After 1-2 weeks in the hospital (physical therapy, checks and such)  she was released. However, she was completely different person.

She started getting into mystical stuff, Buddhism, crystals, connection with the after life, tarot reading. She started playing guitar.

None of the things she had mattered to her. She hated the luxury apartment building they lived in, hated that she had a chauffeur and a maid, hated money and hated her husband's job. 

It's not like she was ungrateful or resentful. She was simply different. Anyway, that's how he described it. He loved her deeply, but it's like they had nothing in common. Almost felt like an arranged marriage. 

I met her couple of years ago (which was about 5 years after she left him) and she was nice, but very hard to talk to. She seemed detached a little bit. Still into that mystical stuff (I guess, because she mentioned something about my aura).

I don't know what happened to her while she was in a coma, and I don't know if other people react like that and how commom this is. But I guess it can change a person.  




 X post to /r/crappydesign. 




 Yeah, in Hollywood films the men always have courage when women are involved. I guess they were trying to show something different. 









  you name it, she will have it

Also, there's no guarantee she'll even want to be in a relationship after she wakes up. I know someone who woke up after a year of coma, and few months after divorced her husband. She wad changed, and needed time to find herself again. 

If she'll be in the same situation (who knows), OP will feel betrayed. It will crush him. But then again, you can't really blame her for that.

 Yes, I'm with you here. Besides, telling anything meaningful to anybody you don't know, is mostly stupid. 




 Yes, but to be fair, OP didn't say: "I don't have money, so I'm not going to spend it on entertainment" (which is a valid statement, regardless of the money you have or the cost). He said: "I'm broke... next month for sure!", meaning he wants to spend $5 on something like that, but he can't do it right now. That's a very fragile situation to be in, and one should probably try to change it as much as they can.

 Re Ponzi scheme. First I wouldn't call it a scheme. It's perfectly clear what's going on, and nobody is trying to deceive or sell a malfunction product here. 

Second, it does rely on a constant stream of paying people to support the previously paying people. Same way as an insurance company client who is depended on other clients, or the company won't have enough to pay him when needed.

Now, we don't need anybody to stop paying taxes, that's an extreme scenario. But what if life expectancy goes higher (without enhanced quality), meaning people will stop working at 70 but will live until 140? That's not far fetched, and it's actually the current trend. Or what if less people will decide to have children while immigration is staying low? Japan is facing that problem.

 Of course, you are right. So the problem is shareholders aren't doing their job and rubber stamp other people's decisions. That needs to be changed. 

About institutional investors. This is only partially correct. The majority holders at large firms are institutional. But those are mostly mutual funds (Vanguard, Fidelity and such). The investors in those funds get to vote, and they even get periodically proxy vote by mail. If they ignore it, the fund will vote for them.

Anyway, saying that CEO get high compensation because of some committee is really putting the blame on the least significant part of the entire process.  




 Google is a growing company. Their 25+ PE indicates investors also perceive it that way. They expect the company to grow and invest in opportunities as it see fits, and they are willing to pay a premium for that chance. Paying dividends will send the opposite signal and will probably crash the stock price on the long term.  




  CEO compensation committee

I'm sorry but no committee is determining the CEO compensation. The committee, if exists - not all companies have it - is part of the board of directors and simply recommends the best salary they see fit. The board is the one that decides and approves compensations.

The board is also directly assigned by the shareholders. And many times CEO compensation goes to a vote by the shareholders.  Also, in some countries there's "say on pay" corporate laws, which means that even if the board made a salary decision without shareholders vote, they (the shareholders) are entitled to call the compensation to a vote and change it.

TL;DR instead of blaming the board is we should blame (the far being CEOs) shareholder.

3. You can't whitelist sites (for example, you can't enable ads on Reddit).
4. It won't work if the ad is hosted on a legitimate domain.

 You get interest from the broker, depends on the agreement you have with it (which is the borrowing costs the short seller is paying for the privilege to sell a stock that he didn't buy).

Also keep in mind that some brokers won't even tell you they are lending your stocks to someone else. I'm not sure if they are obligated to inform you or even pay you.

 Okay, so that's a different point: no culture is really explored. Maybe that's right, I don't claim to support or oppose it. Western culture are familiar to the world (not just to western players), so it's hard to draw the line on where the exploration begins and when the knowing just exists. 

For example, I'm playing now Dragon Age: Inquisition. Knights Templar, Chantry, and other similar terms are all from the western christian history. They need little exploration, because they are known. If they used terms from the Yoruba religion, they would have needed much more exploration and explanation. 

Other games have hundreds of references to American culture (language, media, style, technology, appearance). The nuances are built in.

 Too many Cooks.

 Here's the my method of cooking a perfect rice in a pot. It works every time. For me, it always tastes better than rice cooker. So give it a try:

1. Heat 1 spoon of olive oil in a pot with tight lid
2. Boil water in a separate pot (or use water boiler)
3. Add 1 chopped onion to the heated oil. Saute until soft and transparent.
4. Add 1 cup of rice to the pot. Stir it so it will all be covered in oil. about 2-3 minutes. This will prevent the rice from sticking, and it also hardens it a little.
5. At this point your water should be boiled and ready.
6. Add 1.75 cups of boiled water. Add another cup for extra cups of rice you used (so if you cooked 2 cups of rice, that would be 2.75 cups of water).
7. Stir just a little, make sure the water is boiling again and reduce the heat to a simmer (pretty much the minimal heat).
8. Let it cook for 20 minutes, don't touch it.
9. After 20 minutes, the onion should be on top of the rice and no water left in the pot. Uncover, stir gently with a fork, let it rest for 10 minutes.
10. That's it.

Now, the time of the cooking and the water ratio varies. It depends on the type of rice (short, medium or long grain, where it came from, etc.). So the best practice is to try on your favorite type and adjust the time and the water until you get a perfect result for your taste.

 I suggest that you saute the onions first in a skillet. That will greatly improve the flavor.

If you have enough time and don't want to use skillet, you can slowcook them for several hours before starting your dish. Or, the best option, slowcook large batch on onions (6-8) with some olive oil for 8 hours on low, then divide to 4 portions and freeze. Whenever a recipe calls for onions, add it from the freezer (no need to thaw).

  How is this any different?

Because food, cloths and entertainment aren't preserved as morally equal. I'm not saying those game farms are wrong or immoral, but I can see how it's on the far side of the scale.

Also, breeding animals for food (and the questionable living conditions and slaughtering techniques) is one of the major factors of lifting people above poverty and hunger levels. Many people simply couldn't afford meat if it wasn't delivered like that. While zoos and entertainment farms mostly serve the rich. So I think that point also add to the differences between them.

Anyway, at least those animals get a chance to escape their hunters, put up a fight and die in nature.

 I adopted the recipe from [here]( http://www.myrecipes.com/m/recipe/black-bean-squash-chili).  
The only challenge is to peel the squash, but other than that, easy and tasty. I also added celery and stirred all the spices in the skillet together with the peppers, I think it brings up more flavors.
 
#Ingredients

* 1/4 cup olive oil 
* 3 onions, chopped 
* 4 cloves garlic, minced 
* 1 red bell pepper, seeded and chopped 
* 1 green bell pepper, seeded and chopped 
* 2 jalapeos, seeded and minced 
* 4 15-oz. cans black beans, rinsed and drained 
* 2 14.5-oz. cans diced fire-roasted tomatoes 
* 3 tablespoons chili powder 
* 2 tablespoons cumin 
* 1 tablespoon dried oregano 
* 4 cups butternut squash (about 2 lb.), peeled, seeded and cut into 1/2-inch dice 
* Salt and pepper 

#Preparation

1. Warm oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Saut onions until tender, about 3 minutes. Add garlic; saut 1 minute. Add bell peppers and jalapeos; saut until tender, about 3 minutes.
2. Transfer pepper mixture to slow cooker. Stir in beans, tomatoes, chili powder, cumin and oregano. Arrange squash on top. Cover and cook on low for 6 hours.

#Cooking the rice

In a pot heat 2 tablespoons of oil, add 1 cup of rice and stir to have it all covered. After 2 minutes add boiling water or chicken broth if you prefer more flavorful rice, bring to boil again and let it cook for 10 minutes on low burner. After that, remove from the heat and set it aside undisturbed for another 10 minutes.
 









 Not only cultural but practical. Dogs don't have enough meat, it's not that tasty (lean and hard), it's expensive to feed them and some can be useful through their entire life.  




 Yeah, but don't forget that insurance in mandatory by law in most areas of the world. So it will take time until they'll feel pressure to lower rates. In fact, they are in for some good years with same premiums but less accidents.  




 I wouldn't go far and calling it a scam. There are some unique (and shady) characteristic in the industry:

* It's one of the few industries in which you pay, sometimes years, before you get the service with a chance that you might never actually get it. The company gets to keep the money (and invest it) without actually putting it to work towards the product.
* The standard procedure to get the service you paid for is to sue (either you sue the insurance company or they sue another company).
* It's one of the few industries in which the most important department is the legal department.
* There are lots of scams against insurance companies. It's probably the biggest victim of customers' theft.
* There's an information gap in a sense that the customer usually knows more about the product than the seller (typically it's the other way around).
* Some of the services are mandatory by law. 




 Yeah, HTPC users wouldn't mind, but the fact that it won't be available is seems on Android tablets (I use mine to watch netflix occasionally) and chromecast sucks. At least at the beginning anyway. 




 It says PC is okay. So HTPC users wouldn't mind. But still, blocking it out from Android tablets, consoles, chromecast is risky as hell. I guess not only that Apple paid a lot, but also HBO is very confident to launch in a narrow market. 




 It's a brave decision in the wrong sense of the word. PC is fine, so those with HTPC wouldn't mind. They got the price right, $14.99.  









 Not the same. Most of the aid to Israel is annual military funds, which Israel has to spend on American products. It's basically a corporate welfare. 

China's debt are USA government bonds held by the Chinese government.

Both of those amounts aren't that significant relative to the 100% (USA total aid, USA total budget, USA total debt, Israel budget, China total assets, you name it), but they make good headlines.

 I'd like to add, in addition to response you got from /u/dragontamer5788, that if you do want to use leverage, it's better to leverage the entire account. Meaning, if you hold $10K in double leverage ETF, it's better to hold $20K in the underlying ETF and use half of it as leverage from the broker. 

Margin rates are extremely low now and you won't suffer from beta decay that was explained to you.

Overall, leverage ETFs are bad for long time holding periods. The last few years weren't a good example because the market didn't suffer a lot of volatility, but don't think this condition will last forever nor will you able to know in time when it changes. 









 3 points to think about: 1. Did you shift gears fully? Sometimes half shift causes noise. 2. Are you cross chaining (small ring to small ring or big ring to big ring)? That also can cause some noise. 3. If not half shift and not cross chaining, go to LBS to adjust the gears or do it at home if you have the tools. 




 Yeah, you are right, this is by no means accurate, just something to know as a general guidance. The link between training, calories and weight loss is also non linear. Meaning, training and eating to lose the 100th kg is different than the 70th kg.

 Two options: either use [GPS](http://www.chainreactioncycles.com/us/en/gps) with dedicated software or use an app if you have smartphone. Popular apps are [Strava](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.strava hl=en), [Endomondo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.endomondo.android), [Map My Ride](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mapmyride.android2). The advantage of apps are social (even if you don't like sharing stuff with friends, you can browse and discover lots of routes), nice websites and no need for another device to buy and carry. The disadvantage is that you depend on your phone and its battery. Unlike GPS devices, it probably won't last 5-6 hours unless it's new or you carry an extra portable charger.

If you want to make a bet, then Strava and Endomondo are really good for it, because you can actually challenge your friends and you can see the progress.
 




 From 2009, interview with Larry King:

 **MAHER**: Well, we've talked about it. I'm not into western medicine. That to me is a complete scare tactic. It just shows you, you can...

 **KING**: You mean you don't get a -- you don't get a flu shot?

 **MAHER**: A flu shot is the worst thing you can do.

 **KING**: Why? MAHER: Because it's got -- it's got mercury.

 **KING**: It prevents flu.

 **MAHER**: It doesn't prevent. First of all, that's...

 **KING**: I haven't had the flu in 25 years since I've been taking a flu shot.

 **MAHER**: Well, I hate to tell you, Larry, but if you have a flu shot for more than five years in a row, there's ten times the likelihood that you'll get Alzheimer's disease. I would stop getting your...

 **KING**: What did you say?

 **MAHER**: That went better in rehearsal but it was still good. Absolutely, no the defense against disease is to have a strong immune system. A flu shot just compromises your immune system.

 **KING**: So you don't take any western medicine, don't take an aspirin?

 **MAHER**: Never, an aspirin no. Thousands of people die from aspirin every year.

I also think that western medicine and health practice does a lot of things wrong, but flu vax isn't one of them. He's being stupid here.
 




 I don't know, I think they went too hard on it using all the practices we all hate about business: lobbying, campaigning, lots of money.

I don't think GMO should be labeled, but I also don't see too much harm in it. Especially if virtually all food products will be labeled. It can be like ingredients. Salt isn't bad, but it's still written on the label. If someone wants to control their salt diet, he pays attention while most people don't give a fuck about that.

It's already labeled around the world in the EU and most of the developed countries. [EU: Traceability and labelling of GMOs](http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/environment/nature_and_biodiversity/l21170_en.htm). 




 Good job man. I say keep track of your nutrition. 

Since you like riding long distances and also, if I get it correctly, want to lose weight, it's important to balance your diet. Consuming too little calories while training will increase the chances of fatigue and illness. 

At your pace (20 km/h), you'll burn about 8 calories per kg per hour. So if you weight 80kg and ride 4 hours, that would be 8x80x4 = 2,560 cal. If you want to lose weight, consume 20% less, so about 500 cal less. But try not to get less than that, so you can keep healthy.

If you want to lose half a kilo per week (which is what considered an healthy diet), you would need to consume 3,500 calories less than you burn over the course of the **week**.

Obviously those numbers are just for guidelines and it depends on a lot of other factors. It can still give you general estimation. 




 /r/rage! 




 I think it backfires when those companies fight to not write GMO on the label. People don't trust businesses who try to hide things. So anti-big-businesses stand will be to immediately question GMO. This is, more than anything, a pavlovian response. 




 He's not 100% anti vax. He said he's anti the flu shot. He also brings some arguments about the downside of vax. However, you are still right, his argument aren't really backed by science.

I think his anti vax position is the same as others so-called rich liberal hippies, who used to think it's cool and healthy, only to wake up one morning and see who else support their ideas. At this point it's just a matter of time until they find a ladder to climb down from their stupid tree. 




 Nah, he withdrew that statement. He said he was libertarian when they were the only politicians that talked about weeds. 

He does agree on a lot if things with Ron Paul, mostly drugs and foreign policy. So when he mentions his name he also says that.

 Damn seeing people and their privileges.  




 You are right, I wasn't clear enough and I probably used the wrong terminology out of a hurry. Allow me to clarify.

**Economic efficiency**

If you were a young musician living in rural Wisconsin, it was almost impossible for you to get young listeners in Cleveland, Belgium, Australia, Hong Kong or Slovakia to hear your music and pay for it.

There were too many gates and too few competitive gate keepers between the artists and the consumer.

Therefor supply couldn't meet the real demand. And because of that, all the process in the middle and all the prices and compensations were distorted. 

(The other way around, from Australia, Hong Kong, Slovakia, Belgium **to** USA, was almost non existent). 

First you had to find a record company. Why? because printing vinyl records or compact disks is damn expensive. Distributing them is also expensive. Distributing where? to physical music stores, which also didn't exist abundantly in some markets or were under monopoly in other markets. Those stores also had limited space. How would the consumer even hear your music? The only option was radio and TV. In most of the world there were at best 2-3 variety channels, so the time you had to listen to **your** kind of music was probably 2-3 hours a week (This Top of the Pops and Radio1 in Britain, other places were even worst), that's it. So in the process you had to pass a Label, which held most of the power over you, then radio channel editor and a store manager with limited space. 

That means that everything in the middle: recording, printing, distrusting, art, stores, radio and TV - all were able to manipulate prices, not based on the music, but based on inefficient market conditions.

The market for independent musicians, those who complain today about high fees from iTunes, Google or Spotify, simply didn't exist (or was very minor) just 2 decades back.

By the way, even very successful artists would have killed for 30% flat fee on their sales. Out of $10 LP or $15 CD, artists [received $2 at best](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20100712/23482610186.shtml). Only today you have an option to independently save up $25,000 (it's expensive, but competitive and not unheard of amount), record your first album, mix the music on your computer, put it on youtube, spotify, soundcould, bandcamp, itunes, and earn net 70% of the sales. A direct connection between you and the listener. Almost no gates and no gate keepers. So you get very closely to what you worth in the world. 




 2 points about your quotes and 1 hard truth.

1. The artist says: shirt? No thanks. But he doesn't give any reason for that. Is selling a shirt too low for him? When it comes to music, merchandise are a way for fans to express their love and connection with the music. It's a service to fans, and one that pays back.

2. 'Apple charging 30% and not taking any risks'. That's false. Apple took huge risks in the past to get to this point today. They invested large amount of money in platform and devices way before they were common and far from being a safe bet. Technology works in a way that first you take all the risks, then, if you are one of the very few successful survivors, you get big profit and big margins. 

And to the hard truth: making music isn't that special. There are tons of good artists, they all have access now to mass audience, so the competition is tough.

There's really no reason to pay for something that exists abundantly. The old market wasn't efficient because record companies created artificial scarcity.  

If you are a small band, and you make good music, you are offering something that is offered by thousands more. Why would someone pay you premium for that, when the limited resource here is the time to listen to all the good music available. 




 My experience with ETS2: played for hours, drove between all cities, explored most roads. Still can't reverse park a truck. 




 How about Moneyball?

http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1301.Moneyball

*Billy Beane, general manager of MLB's Oakland A's and protagonist of Michael Lewis'sMoneyball, had a problem: how to win in the Major Leagues with a budget that's smaller than that of nearly every other team. Conventional wisdom long held that big name, highly athletic hitters and young pitchers with rocket arms were the ticket to success. But Beane and his staff, buoyed by massive amounts of carefully interpreted statistical data, believed that wins could be had by more affordable methods such as hitters with high on-base percentage and pitchers who get lots of ground outs. Given this information and a tight budget, Beane defied tradition and his own scouting department to build winning teams of young affordable players and inexpensive castoff veterans.*

  I find it very helpful to avoid repetition.

But here's the thing. If you find yourself repeating, then there's something in the structure of your writing that needs changing. And if you still think that structure is fine and repeating is unavoidable, then it's important enough to keep using the same word or it will be just confusing.

  It's basically the same as producing 3 feature films

Probably not. As much as those episodes have high production value compared to TV, it's still not close to a film. For example, the budget of The Imitation Game was about $15M. I doubt the budget for each episode is more than $2M. I bet that post takes much less time than a film, but I couldn't find any sources to back that up.

The answer has to be with the schedule of Cumberbatch   Freeman, both very busy and popular at the moment. I'm sure Hollywood pays more than the BBC and also provides more opportunities, so we can't really blame them for their priorities.

 Cereal bars usually aren't good enough because it takes time for them to digest and deliver calories to your body. Fruits and drinks are quicker and more efficient in that regard.

Overall, you should aim to consume about 150-200 calories per hour, depending on your pace. 1 banana will give you about 120 cal.

If you want to eat something more solid, like a sandwich (PB J will give you about 200 cal, depending on the bread), do it as part of a full 20-30 minutes stop.

**Basic recipe for home made drink**: mix 1/3 cup of your favorite juice (orange, apple, cranberry and such), 4 tablespoon of sugar (should be around 60g), 1/4 teaspoon of salt with water to fill up 1L. That should give you around 250 calories per Liter, which is the recommended amount.

 I play two games that have something that might be overkill, and they both have the same mechanics. In Dragon Age: Inquisition there are Focus skills and in Path of Exile there are Vaal skills. In both games you basically need to kill enemies to charge those skills (in DA:I the more you kill, the more powerful the skill becomes, up to 3 stages). When the skill is charged you can use it once, and needs to recharge it again. 

Overall I think it's a good mechanic that add some depth and tactic to the game. POE is ARPG so the skill get charged quickly, but in DA:I you need to be a bit more calculated if you want it available to a boss fight. 




 God damn it. 




 /r/lewronggeneration might also like it. 




 I think you miss the point a little. Of course he can do it. But it's more risky. Meaning, if he does it a 100 different times, he'll fall 1-2 times and lose the stage. Hell, some of them even fall in roundabouts. Don't they know how to make a simple circle? of course they do, but it's more risky. So the question is: Is sidewalk hopping a good practice from risk/reward perspective?  









 Overdone. 




 This is why I liked living in a busy street in NYC. The UPS truck arrived around the same time every day, parked in the same spot, and it took them about 20-30 minutes to deliver all the packages. So I had plenty of time to just approach the truck with the slip they left on the door (of the building!) and get my stuff. 




 Thanks. I thought it was certain that carbon frame can't be held by the frame. When I bought my car roof mount I was also told that by the seller. 




 Sarah Silverman is one of the best things that happened to comedy in the past decade.  




 Correct. That's why [countries with dictatorship](http://www.ranker.com/list/countries-ruled-by-dictatorship/reference), in which people don't value democracy and personal freedom, are ranked at the top of every category and basically live a rich, happy and worry-free life.  
























  You can't get a refund just because you didn't like it

I disagree here. I buy a kindle book, I can return it. I buy digital album from Amazon, I can return it. Amazon doesn't ask me why and how far I got into the book (they ask, but for survey purposes). You buy a book from B N, you can return it back, even if you read it.

Some people always going to abuse the system, that's part of doing business. some people are taking third refill and throw the full cup to the trash. 

 You are paying for an experience

I'm not paying to watch a movie, I'm paying for having a good time. I'm not paying for words on paper, I'm paying to enjoy reading a book. If I didn't have a good time, I didn't get my money worth. Sure, it's partly my problem, but it's also partly the seller problem. 

Guess what. Make good music, make good movies and good games, perform good shows and 99% of the people won't ask for refund. In fact, your business will double because people won't be afraid to take a chance and try your experience. 

**Most people aren't trying to game the system**.

 that is really a luxury, not a right

Of course. I never talked about some basic human right or whatever. Just something that I expect from businesses I work with. 




 OP, do you know this guy? if so, please tell him to contact me.

 Yeah, I don't understand the other responses in this thread. You buy a product, any product, you are not happy with it, whatever the reason might be, you should be able to return it and get a refund.  









 I don't think it's a fair comparison. Hannibal, the films, had only two legit movies: the Silence of the Lambs and Reg Dragon (the other films were written just to cash in on tSotL success). In both of them, Hannibal isn't the main character. 

In fact, Anthony Hopkins Oscar winning performance in tSotL was limited to 15 minutes only (second shortest performance to win an Oscar). So the fact that he made a legendary villain in such a short screen time, spending most of it behind bars, says a lot about the actor and the writing/directing.

TV Hannibal gives lots of time to explore the character and his motivation. 2 seasons in, where the second half of each season is devoted to Will/Hannibal conflict, gives a lot to work with.

TV Hannibal also had enough time to introduce another character: Dr. Bedelia Du Maurier (Hannibal's psychiatrist) which is a whole new avenue of character exploration. And on that note, I also like to add that TV Hannibal can allow itself to be very slow with lots and lots of one-on-one talks. 

With 2 psychiatrists (Hannibal, Du Maurier), 1 psychology professor (Bloom) and 1 criminal profiler (Graham) (edit: I'm adding +1 psychiatrist as Chilton) - almost every conversation feels like a therapy session. So no wonder we understand the characters better.

The TV show main challenge is exactly the opposite: keeping some mystery to the character (which I think they are doing a great job at).   




 Boyd said it: just admit you want to win. 




 I'm still waiting for someone to correct me instead of just d/v. In fact, the top answer is the same as mine:

 Transsexuals have had surgery. Transgender have not. 

Exactly what I said. Plus, not all Transgender will have surgery, while Transsexuals are actively working towards it. 









 Sounds a lot like my gf. 




 I'm scared to click any of the link. I'm gonna wait a while before coming back to this thread. # scarred for life 




 I'm with you on that idea. I don't see it as a white problem and it certainly didn't start with white people. No borders will make the world better off.

 Transsexual don't identify with a their born sex. They work to change their gender, usually through medical intervention. It's a medical condition (GID). 

Transgenders usually just switch and play with their gender. Move back and forth. It's more of a social identity/challenge and less physical/medical issue. 

Transsexuals know their true (mental) gender, it's not what they were born with, and they are working to achieve it. Transgenders, however, don't commit to their true gender, and they feel comfortable in both genders (or don't feel comfortable in any of them).

 USANA is one of the largest MLM companies in the world. Which means, if you know anything about MLM, that you are way too late to get into the game. The right time to get into MLM is never.

 Yeah, I was annoyed also. I mean, you got fucking Snowden for an interview, why waste time making stupid jokes? but I think the interview advanced well. He's a comedian, so I guess humor is his comfort zone, which is understandable and it's not like I know any better about these sorts of stuff. 

Overall, he got the message a cross and wasn't afraid to criticize Snowden/NYT. I also liked that Snowden didn't try to sugarcoat what they called "the fuck-up". He simply said mistakes happen, and being free also means dealing responsibly and accepting those mistakes, instead of silencing everyone. 




 Is there a way to order it online? 









 Most govs don't care, don't have the budget nor the tech nor the connections and influence over tech companies to pull off this kind of surveillance program. Also, some of them truly believe it's wrong. I'm sorry America, you are on your own (maybe with the UK, Russia and China close behind ).

 Not exactly dessert or cake, but still useful and tasty: take any vegan oatmeal muffins recipe, like [this](http://healthyblenderrecipes.com/recipes/happy_herbivores_gluten_free_vegan_oat_flour_muffins) or [this](http://www.averiecooks.com/2014/04/oatmeal-and-chocolate-chip-trail-mix-vegan-muffins.html), and add pulp. You'll probably want to skip the sugar, since you'll get it from your carrot.

 I was disappointed the hashtag didn't have any results. 




 I'm Joe Disney and I would love to buy this story. Can't believe none of my writers thought of this (I'm looking at you Bob Pixar). 




 Yep, that's exactly how I do it. I also want to mention that the leftover pulp is great for cooking. You can keep it in the fridge and later add it to many dishes. I also make oatmeal milk the same way (skip the soaking or just soak for 10 minutes). 




 Sleeping is white privilege.  




  That's right tumblr, I said the "o" word.

Horror in shock? Oppression is probably the most (over)used word in tumblr. If we make a word cloud from tumblr posts, oppression will take half the fucking screen. 




 If you gave germans your word and they were stupid enough to release you, you are even more stupid by returning back to the camp. Honor got nothing to do with it. 




 If you can't walk the walk, at least talk the talk. Self delusion is easier that way. 




 You know when you rewatch a film you liked and you think to yourself: god, why did I like it, it's awful? The opposite happened to me when I recently rewatched the first film. I though: hmm, why didn't I like it the first time? the film isn't bad at all. 




 What's the total length of the trail? Great work and awesome video.  




 Right. 




 Winning an argument - something that wasn't accomplished on the internet since 1998. 




 It was in the front page few hours ago. Dude, keep up, and stop taking breaks from reddit. 




 I'm thinking Nightcrawler. 









 It's like saying that you are inspired by athletes' quotes only if they won the first place in every event they ever participate. 

People may struggle with depression every single day in their life. They fight the urge to end it all more often than not. The fact that they lost just one time, doesn't write off all their struggle and erase all their wisdom to that point.

Successful people with depression is, all by itself, very inspirational. A successful career is hard work day in day out. Regardless on how it's ended.

Anyway, all that besides the point because as other have mentioned, it's not his quote and he was a terminal patient who decided to euthanize himself. 




 The right way of quoting that is either putting the character's name (Sean Maguire) or the writer's name (Matt Damon, Ben Affleck). If there's a picture of Robin Williams, then it should be RW in character. 

In movies it's more common to use the character's name because there are sometimes multiple writers and they aren't always that known. Where in books it's a mix between the character and the author.  




 Quick (serious) question: he says *entered* Africa. Did they migrate to Africa from somewhere? I always thought that Africa is where humanity started. Or is he just using entered as evolved?  









 When a popular non economic publication says: *the stock picking era is over*, it's probably a good time to start picking stocks. 









 PRIVILEGE!!! 




  Also, again, privilege.

Nailed it. 














 Or... you used to believe a lot more pranks back then.  




  it takes practice which he doesn't seem to put in from the free throw line and never has

Maybe. I don't know his routine and I can't/won't defend him. So not putting any effort might be the case. Maybe he doesn't give a fuck, plain and simple. What I'm saying is that it's not likely. I also say, that as a general phenomena, we don't see correlation between improving shooting percentage and practice (at this level, I'm not talking about amateur players). 




 Well, I can't tell specifically about Rondo. I mean, the guy is a pro player, he has any motivation in the world to be successful at his profession. And if it's something as easy as practicing more, he's probably doing that already.

He used to hit 60% at the start of his career and fell to 30% this season. This is either an abnormal reading (same as LeBron getting 4 points in the finals, or Kobe getting 80 points, but on a larger scale), a new trend, or he might hit a mental wall in his performance. 

Either way, I can't believe that simply training more or shooting extra 100 shots after a game (which he probably does) is what's gonna make a difference here. It might build confidence which is good, maybe take some pressure off, but it's not like this will improve his eye/hand coordination by 100%.

 Yeah, you are right of course about the LoLN. I should have added that it's given as a way to explain my point, but not as something that mathematically describes the game.

Anyway, my point is that player's stats are pretty much locked in a tight range, and it takes practice to keep it that way. Saying that players with low % should just practice more, is being a little unfair to them. Most of the players in the league train close to what humanly possible with guidance from the best trainers in the world. 




  Put the shots in and get better at a skill that is required for your fucking job

It's really not that simple. If you (or any other human being) start playing basketball regularly, you'll reach your average numbers pretty quickly ([Law of large numbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers)). After that, it'll be very hard to change those averages. Doesn't matter if you'll get $1m a month, if you shoot x%, you'll shoot x%. Sure some players see different stats over the years, but they are few and the change isn't very significant (1SD plus/minus). This change isn't often contributed to practice but to other factors like health, fatigue or just abnormal readings.

And some anecdote: Kobe Bryant is probably [the hardest working player in the past 2 decades](http://www.businessinsider.com/kobe-bryant-work-ethic-2013-2?op=1). His [FT% ranges](http://i.imgur.com/XBJcKOS.png) from 82% to 85% without any trend. His FG% ranges between 42% to 46%. That's extremely narrow range for 20 years pro career. It's like none of this practice really mattered.

So the fact is that practice around the clock is needed just to keep you on your averages.  




 Yeah, but I don't put automatic trailing command. I adjust it manually. For example, I can put the stop below the swing low. If the position still alive after few days, I might place the stop based on weekly chart. If the position moves up (or down if it's short) I might use ATR. If the stock had a trend that never violated X days moving average, I might use that line as a moving stop.

I must say that in my experience this is **a low probability** setup. Meaning, 8-9 times out of 10 I stopped out at a worse price than if I had just liquidized at target. However, the 1-2 exceptions usually make up for it. The hard part is keep doing that until it pays off. 




 Plot twist: the CEO of HRC is named Tammy. 




 One cannot. You gotta trust the source. Most hacks that replace libraries and executables (i.e. dll, exe files) do some kind of memory scan/write. Those commands are identified by virus scanner as malware. Most key-gens will be picked up also.

Virus scans are good for legitimate files that you aren't sure about the source. For example, when you download Windows installation (without the loader). Or when someone in some forum uploads a file that you aren't sure about. 




 Good for him. Any comedian that's worth something gotta upset somebody. He's lucky the bar for upsetting (or should I say triggering) isn't very high today.

 They're good, but you'll get positive results for some legit hacks. 




 For me it depends on different factors. First, some of my systems are pure quant, so I always take 100% at target. Second, with some of the manual picks, I tend to place a stop near the target and let it run. The longer the position survive the more comfortable I am with wider stops (my trend is validated). Third, if the position is too big, which usually means that I miscalculated the volatility/risk, I'll trim large part of it at target (getting the risk wrong typically means I got other things wrong). And last, if it's the end of a quarter (like today) I tend to be more conservative and book profits early.

  I live outside the US, so the default maps aren't good for me. I read that you can use open-maps?

That depends on where you live. [OSM](https://www.openstreetmap.org/about) is created by the community, so street names/locations/tracks/trails will be as updated as users updating it. 

Check the website and see if it's good enough for you (probably is). If not, you can either buy Garmin maps or try other methods to obtain those maps.

Just a quick addition: you can download OSM to Garming from [here](http://garmin.openstreetmap.nl/). 




 Okay, i'll be a minority here: I always listen to music. Doesn't matter if I ride on my road bikes or mtb (or hiking or running or basically any other activity but swimming) I'm always with music. I simply can't imagine myself doing something without a soundtrack, that's a big part of my experience. 

People say it's dangerous and you should listen to your bikes and the traffic. I'm not arguing with that, I guess there's a point here. 




 Gap: stocks that open considerably above or below yesterday's close. It's wrong to give a hard number here, but basically you want to start with stocks that opens with 5% gap or more. For volatile stocks you want a number higher than that.

Volume: you want here also a considerably high volume. Lots of money changing hands mean the stock has a potential to move a lot during the day.

A good time and place to start is earning season, and look at companies that report [before the open](http://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=111 f=earningsdate_todaybefore) or [after yesterday's close](http://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=111 f=earningsdate_yesterdayafter).

 Rachel also says "justified" to Drew Thompson while Raylan is there, in probably one of the best episodes of the show: Decoy.

 That how you Justified it? 




 Well, I look at it differently. I don't think it's a matter of friendship or respect. I think they have a strong bond. They feel connected. Same age, same childhood, similar hard families, weakness to the same woman... and almost similar fate (Raylan can easily image himself in Boyd's shoes and vice versa). They were also exposed to each other (Raylan letting Boyd leave after his father died, Boyd taking him to Nick Augustine). So I would say it's closest thing they have to a family.

 The movie is an almost 20 years old sci-fi and still holds well today. On top of comedy, action and drama blend there's also great timing and a very nice soundtrack. Not a single dead minute in that movie. 

It's also worth noting that it was the second movie Luc Besson directed and wrote in English (after Leon: The Professional, which is also worth watching in case anybody missed it). Great launch to his career.

  You need to be a goddamn murder wizard to pull it off. 

Yeah, like Hannibal. Think of him as a super villain and it all makes sense.   














 I don't think the "no experience" is related to his physical and weaponry ability. You can be a super soldier, black op, spy and half alien. But if you never worked at a county police, never filled forms, never talked on the radio the way police officers do, never picked up the language, you'll be spotted immediately. So unless they cover that particular point, it's obviously unrealistic. 

I personally don't mind, because that's the premise of the show, that's the foundation. So by the end of the first episode, you either except it or you won't enjoy the story. 
 




 Yeah, there's some weird vibe to it that I can't put my finger on. Anyway, it also gets better through the seasons, which is good. I didn't like the first season that much, but the writing and action got better and better.

 You summed it up well. I enjoyed the first season, but I can't say I'm looking forward to the second season for those exact reasons. Another show that fall down this hole is The Affair.  




 I think it's much more complicated than that. [](#s "He's being an asshole, right. But he's also a scapegoat, a victim, an outcast and totally depended on their good will. He built trust, and he was able to being an asshole in a personal way.") I think it was written nicely.

 I bought used bikes last month. The first thing I asked after the size was: 'I hope it doesn't come out weird, but did you, by any chance, molested a child or participated in child molestation or the general elections?' 




 2 party system magnifies the problem. And I didn't say I want to "get rid of money and politics", I was pointing out that unlimited money fueled elections skews the familiarities of candidates. 

Let me ask you this, do you think there's a significant downside to cap each candidate spending, let's say $200M, and also cap the ad time? 

This works well in many democracies and I don't think people in those countries see it as limiting.   




 Also because politicians who won't support the rich guys have very little chance of even becoming known. Especially in a 2 party system, in which the party as a whole has a strong interest to promote the people who can bring the most money in.

  property is used to exploit others while possession is not

If I'm not mistaken, property creates value beyond personal need, i.e. any means of productions. So any land/factory/machinery/computers that are used to create stuff to be sold to other people are considered properties, and therefore, according to anarchists/communists cannot be privately held but belong to the common.  

Just a quick edit: maybe not belong to the common, but to all the workers who are working on that property.  









 Exactly.  




 That's very nice, gz. How many breaks did you take? I'm always conflicted on how to time mine. 









  I have a ton of miles on my back. Three buldging disks (a tear in one), stenosis of the nerve route and spondylolisthesis. I suffer from sciatica and after games I often cant sit in the car on the drive home, which has made for some interesting rides. Most nights Im bothered by severe cramping in both calves while I sleep, a result of the same damn nerve routes, and the list goes on somewhat comically. Thats what you deserve for playing over 1,300 NBA games. By no means do I tell you this for sympathy  especially since I see these ailments as badges of honor  but maybe I can bring some clarity. 









 Cool, thanks.  




 Frittata is easy and works well with many veggies.

 From what he said last year, the injuries aren't bad, he doesn't suffer pain, and he can do physical activities. It's just playing NBA is, obviously, too much to handle and probably too risky.

I'm glad he stopped playing while he's still healthy and young (relative to normal people) and I hope he'll live long and happy.

 Best line: their stuff is shit, but your shit is stuff.  




  a show that always showed things exactly as they happened

Exactly. And this scene was showed through Tony's eyes. Hence, the blackness. If you watch this scene, you'll see his POV is established few times before the ending. There are also some foreshadowing done throughout the season ("you never see it coming", "all turn black", "you don't hear the gun", etc.). 




 The best thing about this line is Rylan preaching to another guy, while he himself being the number one asshole in Harlen.  




 It's less a matter of the show being funny or not, but more a matter of structure. 

**Drama** is about conflict and resolution through action or personal change that often comes through a personal discovery process and sometimes life changing choices. **Comedy** is structured to serve the "joke" (or the absurd). Comedy conflicts are often based on misunderstandings or miscommunication for a reason: they don't require tough choices and personal change to be resolved. At the end of the comedy, the characters are usually on the same place as they started. 

Now, obviously this is a broad generalization, and we are lucky to have shows that are good in mixing and bending those structures.

However, in most shows is easy to tell where they lean or where they spend the most time. OitNB is drama (that is often funny). As an opposite example, Louis is a comedy (with some strong drama elements). 

 




 Link to the article in discussion: [The Irrationality of Alcoholics Anonymous - The Atlantic](http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2015/03/the-irrationality-of-alcoholics-anonymous/386255/).

It's an interesting topic. But like both women say, there is mostly anecdotal stories (which they both use). The studies do support the social interaction that comes with AA meetings (and obviously can be arranged by other programs). The "12 steps" is however questionable. Yet it can be looked as a framework. For example, let's say I have a training program that allow people to get into shape and lose weight (that's equivalent to the social part of AA, meaning, that part that works). I also build my program around 12 steps in which I encourage the participants to reflect on the lives and what not. That might not be very helpful, but it gives some kind of framework and leveling experience.

I didn't know how to express those thoughts until I got to age 2.  




 But this exact post disproves your claim. Case in point, people not complaining about Asians making more money. 

Anyway, you use an unrealistic claim ('let's say we had a perfect society') to avoid dealing with realistic issues ('we are not even close to this'). I think there's fallacy hidden here.  









 Hard the generalize because of different road conditions, but I would say a flat every 1000-2000 km is very reasonable and on the low side. So for you, a flat every 2-3 months is expected. If you have good tires and high pressure the only thing left really is to watch the road and hope for the best. 




 I didn't want to post a list to avoid giving wrong sense of confidence. A bike mechanic will be able to do the job 100% better than you and me. Since you ask, here's a very short list:

* **Wheels**: if you can you wobble it from side to side, it probably has some damage. Does it clear both sides and rotate straight? broken spokes? 

* **Brakes**: worn pads. Touch the wheel or the tyre. (brakes on general are hard to test, because the cables are hidden)

* **Chain**: Rust. Can you pull it easily out of the teeth? that's usually a sign for a worn chain.

* **Pedals**: Smooth spin, rattle free.

* **Frame**: look for dents, especially at the ends of each tube. If the fork looks bent or asymmetrical, it's a big red flag.

 




 Every few months, on 500km per month, isn't that bad.  




 This week I bought used bikes. The process was simple: 1. Meet with the seller, see if you spot anything wrong with the bike 2. Take it for a ride, the longer the better, so bring proper clothes, shoes and something to leave as a collateral (I left driving license) 3. If all good and the bike fits you well, arrange a second meet at local bike mechanic that will examine the bike (suggest the seller to split the bill). If the mechanic gives thumb up, complete the transaction.  




 For those wondering about the other 8, I was able to verify just 7:

 Sure thing. My two main devices are Android phone and android tablet. Usually during the day I'm with my phone, reading casually. At night I like using my tablet for better reading experience. Now, I'm not saying it's a huge issue by any means, but it's a real nice QOL. When I open my tablet, I need to skip all the posts that I already saw on my phone. 

I don't think it's something that needs to be solved on Reddit's level (i.e. using the API), it's a sync between BR (much like Amazon Kindle software that can sync the last page you read in each book across all devices in which the software is installed).

Anyway, maybe a nice feature for you think about in the future versions. I'm glad to see you read and respond to users. I have tried several apps and I keep coming back to BR, it gives me the best experience so keep doing what you doing.

 I didn't say that I know this is the case, but it's naive to assume otherwise. Like you said, unless there's a way to sniff traffic (which is probably encrypted) and prove otherwise, why people assume Amazon doesn't know what's going on *their* devices?  




 I know that, like other people commented, a pro thief will steal your bike if he wanted to, regardless of your lock. However, you should lock your bikes properly against *casual* thieves, which are the majority: dishonest people passing by and see an opportunity.

Against them , what you need to do is:

1. Get a decent lock/chain that can't be cut easily with a cutter. Small U lock are great, but they also give you less flexibility. 

2. Get a massive lock, that isn't a combination lock.

3. Lock the bike to an object that can't be broken, cut or easily removed from the ground.

4. A combination of u lock and cable is good.

5. Use the U lock to wrap the object, the inside frame and the front wheel. Use the cable to wrap the object, back wheel, and rear triangle frame and maybe the chair if you have enough room below it to pass the cable.

 




 Some people are going too far to avoid traffic on their commute route.  




 I have the app installed on several devices, and I usually browse with visited posts hidden (on a side note, I find it much less convenient now that toggling this option is on the third menu level). When I switch to another device I need to skip the posts I already read. Is there a way to sync this?

Thanks. Awesome app. 




 I'm sorry, but you have to assume they have. Unless you completely block internet connection on your kindle, you have to assume that Amazon reads *everything* on your device, including your epub, pdf and text files. 

And just to add, they don't do anything with mobi/awz4 files, but I bet they are aware of their existence on the device. There's simply little they can do about it.

 Best Kale shake:

* frozen banana
* peanut butter
* yogurt
* milk
* kale

Put the banana, pb, yogurt, milk in a blender. Give the kale to your dog. If the dog doesn't eat it, throw it away. If the dog does it, you should probably throw the dog. Drink your shake, go on with your day.
 




 As a stock trader I can tell you one thing: You can't mix stock market opinions with political ideology. If you want to make money in the market, put your thoughts/beliefs/tribe aside during trading hours, and treat the market like a book to read from and your positions like a blank paper to write into. 

ZH never picked one of the two. So the results were 5 years trying to anticipate the next market crash that didn't happen. And when you are dead wrong for so long, you stop attracting reasonable people, and start pulling perma-bears and nut cases. Not because it's stupid to predict a crash (it's stupid to predict anything in the market), but because they predict using all the wrong reasons and sticking with it too long.

ZH best moments were when he/they put real inside information from the financial world. their downfall was that every inside story was accompanied by bad market crash predictions and ridiculous conclusions. 

So my stupid prediction is that when ZH  becomes completely  irrelevant or shuts down - that's when the bull market ends.  









 Can the dough be frozen and used later? 




  Given the power, he would stop people (gay people, specifically) from living their lives as they see fit

At this point, not even the president has this power. That ship has sailed. Doesn't matter who'll be in office. 




  since there is the divided ownership of property

Who says that ownership of relationship are 1:1? If people are happy in multi-party relationship, good for them. Some people can't give affection to only one person, and some people want affection from more than one person.  




 How can we be for real if our kids aren't real? 




  Everybody was optimistic

 We stayed in the cellar and begged that we would survive

It really takes a lot to be optimistic in this situation and not totally lose it. I can't even begin to imagine how I'm going to feel if instead going on my daily life I now need to spend time in a bomb shelter for **few years**. 




 Oh, you are one of those straight faces guys in the audience right? Let's keep it serious and on point all the time guys, chickens are falling from the skies and it's no time to joke around.

 The Russians don't fuck around: oh, you smuggle drugs? That's cute, we deliver fucking submarines.  









   people who say "I want X for every American" refuse to acknowledge that life in general is and will always be better for people with more money

That's true, but I think the X here implies some **minimal level** of education, healthcare, living income, water, infrastructure etc.

So they are not saying they want every American to have the same education, just that they want every American to have at least good education. If some can get more, good for them.  




 You are right about the separation, but would you vote for someone that says it's immoral to marry black people? Sure, he won't criminalize it, but he thinks it's wrong.  

Saying it's a "moral crisis" brings us back decades as far as understanding gay people. 

I personally don't think that it's a make or break for a president, but it's a sure one big minus. 

I also expect his position to turn if he wins the Republican nomination and moves to the national stage. There's no way he's going to stick with the moral argument on general election.  




  Unwanted growth inside you that causes you harm, steals your nutrients, and you want removed. You'd have the right to remove any person from being INSIDE YOUR BODY

Overall I agree with this point, however, how is that different than a 2 years old child, living in your property, taking resources? Do parents have the right to abandon their kid for the same reasons?

 Why? I got a small footprint portable app running in the background. All I have to do is copy youtube link to the clipboard and 3 seconds later the song is in my folder. Sure, it's not 320K but that's what torrent full albums are for. But to build an occasional playlist of some popular songs for car ride or workout? Nothing is faster or easier.

Not to mention that I can browse the front page of any music sub, and build my playlist just by copying the posts urls.  




 For singles I just use one of the many youtube downloaders.

 It costs lots of money because very few, if any at all, are issued each year. Almost all of the market is secondary (between old drivers to new) so prices go up. Taxi drivers are the first to object to issuing more medallions because they don't want more competition. 

In many cities there are few large taxi businesses which own all the licenses and they rent them to individual drivers. This way they maximize its usage (the license drives 24/7) and sees its value goes up due to lack of supply, which they fight hard to keep it that way. They are also in position to outbid any new player. Many banks will use the other medallions the business owns as a collateral for a loan for new medallion.

The second reason is interest rates. When interest rates are low, such as today, all yielding products, from bonds to real estates to medallions go up in price to adjust for lower return.

 Well, now you don't know the ultimate response to "ill kick ur ass". 




 From the book [AFFC, Ch6]: 

 Fear cuts deeper than swords, she told herself. Arya. She whispered the word the first time. The second time she threw it at him. I am Arya, of House Stark.

 You are, he said, but the House of Black and White is no place for Arya, of House Stark.

 Please, she said. I have no place to go.

 Do you fear death?

 She bit her lip. No.

 Let us see. The priest lowered his cowl. Beneath he had no face; only a yellowed skull with a few scraps of skin still clinging to the cheeks, and a white worm wriggling from one empty eye socket. Kiss me, child, he croaked, in a voice as dry and husky as a death rattle.

 Does he think to scare me? Arya kissed him where his nose should be and plucked the grave worm from his eye to eat it, but it melted like a shadow in her hand.
The yellow skull was melting too, and the kindliest old man that she had ever seen was smiling down at her. No one has ever tried to eat my worm before, he said. Are you hungry, child?

 Yes, she thought, but not for food

(tl;dr she was hungry, but not for food) 









 We? 




 That's a weird way to hold a bill. 




 When I mention books here or in other subs I usually link to goodreads. It's a good database, and I know if someone follows the link, they'll be able to easily get more info on the author, synopsis, reviews and similar books.

 It's also about a business making money. If you screen at home, you (usually) do it with good faith, for your entertainment. 

Here's a business that sells drinks/food to viewers, probably advertise the event and in it solely for the money. 




  ...  and were given a $10 voucher for concessions.

It's encouraged to keep reading *at least* until you hit a dot.  




 This is not exactly the piracy argument, because here we have a 3rd party that makes money using the HBO product/brand. I can't just sell GOT T-Shirts in my area with the excuse that HBO doesn't sell here anyway, so they aren't losing any money. 

Also, piracy arguments go against (or justify) the end consumers. In this case HBO didn't go after the viewers, but after the theater.  




 Spoiler: there won't be a next time. No sequel to that movie.  




 Yeah, probably. Decentralized or quantified and automated. Or both. 









 Sure they make mistakes. We, the uninitiated, who more often than not smart in hindsight, would have made 10 times more mistakes. 

I also think that people underestimate the number of decisions an executive (in any business) makes in a week. That's why there's so much misunderstanding about CEO's pay. 

So yeah, someone might get right one show, but let that person decide on every show for few years, and he will probably drive the network to the ground. 



















 I listened to one track so far, and it's absolutely great. Thanks.

 to make a certain script run at startup, simply create a shortcut to that script in your startup folder

 As someone who worked a lot with dogs, I must say that he got the main idea. However, it's almost impossible to implement in real life, especially if the dog is trained to arrack (like k9). A more reasonable approach would be to give up the hand, there's nothing you can really do to avoid it. Try to minimize the distance, don't hit or kick (they won't feel anything anyway), and if you are close enough try to fall on the do and position yourself behind his head. If you fell on the ground and the dog isn't beneath you (most chances for trained dogs), you lost. 




 And end his rant with something about weed. He's like 14y/o that gets excited and must talk about those edgy things like atheism and weed without anybody asking or giving a fuck. 




 Oh thanks. Obviously I'm not going to take this test because I know exactly where I land. (Hint: there are many like them, but this is mine)

 Hypocrisy will depend on her argument. If she claims the inequality problem/solution is $/hr wage cap, then yes. 

But if she claims the solution to inequality is minimum wage, taxes, CEO/employees salary ratio, free education, glass ceiling or dozens of other arguments (right or wrong), then no, hypocrisy got nothing to do with that. 




  How much memory you got on that stick? 




 Season 6 ended few days ago, ending the series. 




 [Curb Your Enthusiasm!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIVYdd60eNs) 




 Yes. Well, they should. You expect from a waiter in this kind of restaurant to explain the dishes fluently and the way they are made, to match wines and other drinks (even if they have a sommelier), to bring your food exactly when it's ready, to serve just 2-3 tables at a time, etc. Now, if you think that's not worth the tip, then it's fine, you don't have to visit the restaurant. Lots of people don't think a steak for two should cost $225. 




 Yes. 




 Sure, who doesn't? I love my piss and I think it pairs well with rosemary garlic bread. It's understandable however, if a post with my piss in tall glass and pickles on the side will be removed from /r/food.  




 To be fair, OP could have made his point without being a dick. 




 Neither. Manufacturing something bigger isn't innovative and selling something you can do without isn't a scam. It's called flavor and there's is a place for many of them in any market.  




 A bit of cliche maybe, but Catcher in the Rye. I read as a teenager (well, didn't we all), and suddenly I wasn't afraid of life anymore. I felt belonged.  




 Because everybody was looking for EVA! 




 Yeah, that was nice connection. However, Boyd is wrong, because all 3 of them made it out alive. That's why I liked the idea of the song 'never leave Harlen alive' was played about 3/4 through, when their fate wasn't just clear.  




 Person of Interest. It's a broadcast series, so 20+ episodes/season, some of the episodes are case of the week type, but there's a long arc. The characters are developed steadily, the story gets more and more complicated, and some of the dialogs and one-liners are great. 

Also, I just posted in /r/PersonOfInterest how it's the most represented show in IMDB's top 50 highest rated episodes. 5 episodes made it to that list. It's a good show. 




 Person of Interest has 5 episodes on [the list](http://www.imdb.com/search/title?num_votes=1000, sort=user_rating,desc title_type=tv_episode) (tied with House MD). 4 of the 5 are top 16.

The episodes are:

 I don't know, I met some 4yo who acted twice their age, so... 8. And we all know that 8 is practically the new 28. I bet he thinks he should ask them how many partners they had, and only move forward if it's 3 or less. Okay, I made myself sick, time to stop. 




 I recommend [An Instance of the Fingerpost by Iain Pears](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15888.An_Instance_of_the_Fingerpost). An historical mystery set in 1665 Oxford, England. The story has 4 parts, each told by a different person. Some of the characters are based on real people/personalities. 









 I wear bracelet for all the bots that cut their wrists. 




 I once gave some change to a homeless guy and I got arrested because "it's not okay for someone to set up a bank and start giving out loans to the public with no license". 




 He pulled first on Raylan. If you go frame by frame, he moved his arm first (hard to tell because both are right handed, and the camera shoots from his left). But anyway, it was half a second after he said to Raylan he'd shoot him. So I guess that's... justified? 




 Out if curiosity I googled season 5 reviews, with 2 weeks time range before the premier. Top results that aren't fan sites: telegraph, frobes, independent, cnet and ew - can't say I'm surprised. Exactly where the current generation hangs out. io9 btw, reported from premier event in SF (probably 1-2 episodes?), which, again, makes much more sense than mass mailing shitty quality DVD. 




 While *Wonderful Tonight* is about his drug dealer getting OD and Clapton had to take him to the hospital in the middle of his wedding. 




 What good a review without spoliers would do a week before the show? To build hype, you send actors to late night shows, you show clips, you make trailers. What's the point of sendind a dvd with 4 (!) episodes to the most hyped show anyway?  




 1. Don't mail a DVD 2. Privately stream couple of hours before the show (like many do anyway today) 3. Review should be online when the show is done.  




 That's good. Those screeners belong to another era (newspapers and monthly/weekly magazines that needs be, what your father calls, "printed". It's got something to do with paper, so I've heard). Time to move on.
 









 I'm glad they didn't. Because the entire final scene was about how 2 of the 3 DID leave Harlan alive. Well, come to think about it, even Boyd is alive.  




 Step 1: verify your health insurance covers practice. 




 Yeah, talking about being in the wrong side of an issue. Maybe legal marijuana is so mainstream that he's trying to be anti establishment.  




 How much per death? 




 I really liked the kings back then. They played great and had a good chance. That uncatched rebound that went straight into Horry's hands for 3 pointer on the buzzer... man, I can feel my blood boiling up again. 




 Man, I'm on the same boat. From time to time I try to force myself to trade the open, so I'll keep busy and not play around, but so far my best trades are EOD, so I'm sticking with that.  




 I left in '09, just before they opened.  




 Yes, and there are also many worksheets available on the web. [This one](http://www.investmentmoats.com/StockPortfolioTracker/stockportfolioinvestmenttracker.php) also has online version (Google docs). 




 Their coach was their superstar.  




 Another way of putting it is "Shaq had Kobe". God, the 2000-2002 Lakers were a real Force majeure. I'm glad I was there to watch them... even if I hated every moment of it. I suddenly remember all the frustration. Like you had start the 4th with at least 20 points lead or you wouldn't have a chance.  




 I lived and worked in NJ. Took me 2 years to come to my senses and move to Manhattan. Never looked back. Well, besides country bike rides and going to Costco. So I guess they have that going on for them. 




 Okay, I'm going to give a different answer here. Where I live, those kind of fences are used to keep motorcycles out of the way of bicycle paths, and you typically see them at the entrance of public parks. 

Anyway, whatever this meant for, it's not doing it. 




 [another one](http://i.imgbox.com/QOotV8fQ.jpeg) 









   it simply asks what happened to them

So even an answer describing "a day in a life" would count as correct.  




 I don't see any click bait. I literally didn't believe what happened next. I sent a PM to the mods, and they verified the story. So not only I'm a believer now, I'm also impressed by OP who knew I would react this way. PS I'm also impressed with the little boy who dressed like spiderman under his dress for 3 years.

 I wonder if she's aware that there are about billion whites living on planet earth. Just 20% of them are in America. And even fewer than that had anything to do with slavery back then. Almost none of them have anything to do with [slavery today](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/Modern_incidence_of_slavery.png) (which I would say is a bigger problem than an issue 150 years ago, but that's none of my business). 

In fact, white people probably contributed (and still contributing) more than any other ethnic/race group to stop slavery.

 Not necessarily the largest and not necessarily bailout, but many do enjoy government's help. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying their existence is depended on this help or that it's a big part of their survival. I'm saying that it does exist.

Here are top 10% names (rank below 50) from F500 (not the S P):

* J.P. Morgan (#18) - all banks rely heavily on Fed short term loans. The target interest rate is basically a guaranteed loan to the business which they can take and leverage other loans to retails at higher rate. Most banks on the list have this privilege. Also, specifically on JPM, the fire sales of BS during the 2008 was a government deal (backing up BS bad debt).  
Citi (#26) was obviously totally saved.  
BoA (#21) received $50B TARP + $100B losses cover during 2009.

* Verizon (#16), AT T (#11) and other networking companies enjoy shielding regulations and limited competition. 

* Exxon Mobil (#2), Chevron (#3), Valero (#10) and other oil companies do enjoy some nice specifics [tax breaks](http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/business/Oil_and_Gas_Breaks.JPG). Shell (#2 on the global F500 list) is also getting $1.5B tax break from Pennsylvania.

* Berkshire Hathaway (#4) - didn't take money directly, but some holdings did (GS (#74), BoA (#21), M T for example). You can probably add rail stimulus money to Burlington Northern.

* GE (#9) got government backup for $139 Billion of its debt. GE is also getting almost half a billion a year from different states.

* Boeing (#30) is getting $200M from South Carolina and another $100M from other states.

* GM (#7), Ford (#8) - $80B government help.

* Fannie Mae (#13) together with Freddie Mac (#32)  - huge bailout (takeover basically).
 




 The French director is Michel Gondry, who directed Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and also won an Original Screenplay Oscar on that film. 

The documentary, *Is the Man Who is Tall Happy?*, is nice, but it's mostly about languages and how they emerge. It's more of a conversation than a documentary, so it gets heavy and repetitive (so does the animation). Worth a shot by all means, but it's not a brilliant film.   




 Yelling "fire" and free speech aren't related. One isn't an exception of the other. 




 wait, what? \*slowly stop raping and walk background* 




 Look, you are right by using 'demanding'. I never said someone wrongs you by not refunding.

 However, if I'm in a restaurant, the waiter asks me how's the food even after I'm done, and I say I didn't like it. It's a good and reasonable practice to suggest a replacement, offer desert or even not charge. Lots of restaurants will do that. Also, more importantly, lots of customers will not demand a full refund. I personally found myself in few situations where I didn't expect refund. Most people are reasonable. 

My point is: if you as a customer didn't enjoy your game, it's perfectly reasonable to ask for a refund. If you are a game developer, it's also reasonable to offer a refund.

The fact that you 'consumed' the experience got nothing to do with it.

 When I told Costco my printer didn't work afrer 3 damn years, they refunded me. And we all know the old printer is 'consumed' and probably going to the trash bin. It's a good and reasonable business policy. And gamers should know that. 




 Oil will probably won't dry up, it's the demand for oil will dry up.

If they are investing, good for them, but it means they'll be some rich Saudi families. Not a rich Saudi country. There's also a good chance that future generations will destroy this wealth, which is typically the case.  




 The Fast and the Furious... and the Rude. 
























 Since it's /r/writing and not /r/books it makes sense. OP wants to read the craft and less the plot. 




 How to claim your content with this one simple trick. 





























 Yeah. It used to be terrific blog when it was just Barry's little project with the crappy default design and LOTS of quality articles. It really shined during the previous cycle. Even today, when I research some topics I google this blog for material. The majority of the usable results I get is from 3-4 years ago and backwards.  









 I would start comparing Swift to Apple when she'll be a multi billion dollar company with $200 BILLION cash reserved.  




 Not everything is measured directly by money-per-episode. There's also reputation, brand name, keeping things fresh, trying to end shows at their pick and making room for something new. 




 That would be too *e**a**sy*. 




 Why not just. 




 Mostly caught up. There are some threads and plots that aren't in the show, so that might be for future seasons. Overall, the faith of the main characters matches the books with few minor exceptions.  














 Also, a player scores 40 points and his average gets lower as a result.  




 He's fading, as they say.  




 Yeah, I wasn't referring directly to you. I noticed it's straight from the article (can we even call it like that?). However, since /r/television doesn't have "matching title" rule, a little editing would be in place: *Kemper delyed by TSA for carring some fruits.* 




 It's hard to compare. Hopkins plays for a very short time, most of it in a cell. So he makes a damn strong impression with limited time and space. He must be much less subtle. Also, tropes that seem today as cliches (the intelligent psychopath killer) weren't that way when SofL was made.  




 What a terrible click bait title. 



















 It's funny, because digital sales should be the easiest to track. 



















 Fading. 




 "I'm gay"

"You're gay?"

"Hey, that's derogatory!" 









 This is some Monty Python level writing. 









 For classic sci-fi you can go with Asimov's Robot's series. It's also great for trips, because each book is a collection of short stories. 

So to start, here are links to the first 5:

 Everything was bad news for legs. Seriously, fuck legs. duopoly, zero competition, same version for years. I charge them for 8 hours, then I can use them for what? 2-3 hours and then I have to charge again. And the speed just decreases over the years, no original parts to change, no warranty.  




 Using Adobe Lightroom, what's your workflow? what are the essentials post you are doing? for me it's mostly adding just a bit of Clarity, Vibrance and medium contrast Tone Curve. Just wondering if others have "go to" adjustments.  



















 What are you talking about? This is prime time television, not public education or ballet. It's a product, and a very successful one. Why wouldn't the market work here? Dozens of new shows are made every season, from both side of the spectrum, very cheap and very expensive. 




 That's like saying red cars take up spots for black cars. There's enough place on the road and more than enough air time with hundreds of channels. If there's a market for your kind of show (you know, the 'real' entertaining ones) someone will make it. 









 Yeah, it's like: oh, someone kills few people over chickens - good, fun action. Someone's having sex with his wife on their wedding day, which isn't even rape in the book's universe - wow, broken and bent, I can't even. (and to fair, not even rape in our universe. If Sansa made a complaint for rough sex in her wedding night, it won't even make it to court)

 They assumed it's for ~~normal~~ white people. Known to be a lazy race since 50,000 BC. 




 Will it punch everyone equally? 




 I would download a tractor. 




 My PC goes to sleep after 30 minutes. I'm going to configure my future auto car the same way. 




 Well, opposite sex appreciates and that's all that matter. When humans appreciate something they also tend to be exploitive. 



















 Okay, time to watch the extended edition yet again. Real world, see you in 12 hours. 




 The site is beautiful, fast, and works as advertised. [Original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/361a71/hi_reddit_i_built_an_image_search_engine_that/). 














 I'm glad to hear (ha ha) about the fully voiced characters. As much as I loved and played the game, lack of voices broke the immersion for me. With that and the new quests with fresh ending, I'll definitely give it another go. 




 So you are saying the hair also disappointed of him. 









 Thanks. Sad news for me. 









 Short and safe answer: yes. The important ones (email, bank, facebook, paypal, credit card, utilities websites, windows, etc - any password that leads to an account with real life information).

Edit: I just want to state how a good firewall is important. Lots of anti-virus, anti-malware will identify the keylogger, but they have lots of false positives. However, when a firewall prompts that a process wants access to outside world (send or receive), there should be a real good reason to allow it. Even if it's a legit program, 95% of them don't need (or shouldn't need) internet access to work properly. I can count on my hand the number of programs on my pc that get internet access. 

So in this case, even is the keylogger worked, it won't be able to send the data out. 




 Easily one of the best trailers I have seen in the past few years. 




 Last I heard was that Bradley won't return as Ronnie Brooks, which is a bummer. Does anybody know if more episodes are planned and when? I really like this adaptation, and my only complain is that they stick too much to the original scripts (And as a L O fan, means I pretty much know all the plot after the opening scene. Still liked it plenty though).
 




 You can try Hola (with Chrome) and BBC's iPlayer.  



















 Most of the stuff is like final assignment for design graduates. If you do like this kind of stuff, check [Yanko Design](http://www.yankodesign.com). Lots of designers submit photoshop mockups of products.  
























 I would actually support a 4 point line between the arc and mid court. Makes the game more interesting, what's not to like. 




 I tried to slide the second image. Why do I always fall for that? 




 I get it, nobody likes it when "his" term of identity is "stolen" and mis-used, but language, economy and social habits are all living things, they change and evolve over time. 

The word "socialism" isn't what it used to mean, and it means differently in different part of the world. So it changes through time and space. 

So don't be the guy, that when someone calls him "the guy" (like I just did) says in reply "actually, did you know that **guy** comes from the name of Guy Fawkes and it used to mean effigy, and I just hate it when people use it differently." 




 You want to tell me that some people think 35 minutes of mounted travel is SHORT? 




 On a blind test, you'll swear it's an ice cream. 









 Magic wasn't a scorer. 




 Where you leave, do politicians have immunity for murder? Can they buy M1 Abrams tanks for personal use with tax payer money? how come they can't? who's enacting those law? 

So to me, if I were a person who's okay with *The System*, I would simply point out that the same laws and regulations that prevent them from murdering and buying tanks should be extended to hookers and drugs. 

Most people think *The System* works, and any flaw can be fixed within *The System*. The flaws that can't be 100% fixed are tolerable and are justifiable cost to keep *The System* running.

Now, I'm not saying they are right or wrong, but I don't see how simply pointing out something that be fixed by law is going to convince anybody.  




 If you want a cool variation without icecream (dairy free), try frozen banana and coconut cream as a base. It works great. Make sure to peel, slice before freezing the banana. 

To that you can add any fruit (like frozen strawberries, blueberries) or cocoa poweder or cookies or peanut butter.

For refreshing taste, try mint and vanilla.

If it's too thick (but then, how can a milkshake be too thick) add coconut milk. 




 Excellent. I saved it in my notes. 




 That's his 2nd worst year with TO. I think it's because he has to carry the ball more and make more plays for the team. Irving is a great point guard, but I guess his injuries impact that as well.  




 The first half was like watching an 8th grader sneaking into 3rd grader game.  




 Probably divorced and make them go with shirts like: MO|AD and DA|OM. 




  The good news is nigga you came a long way

 You can see how he started to time from half court. Basically looked at Rose and didn't run until Rose was past him. 




 You are on point. We like candidates with teen spirit and adult temper. They usually don't go hand in hand. Paul got the first but lack experience (though he's getting there). Clinton acts professionally but lack substance. Obama, the 2008 candidate, had a lot of the first, and enough of the second. 

That's why Sanders excites the liberal base, because he's got both (not that he has a chance of winning, but that's for other reasons, just don't tell that to Reddit).  




 Home got to it. 




 They are both patients in a mental hospital. He just doesn't know it. 




 As real as this story mate (that's 100% if you haven't been following). 




 Why? are you saying people don't have the right to exercise 2nd amendment right? what's triggering you in this story? oh, I get it, the stray dog. That would be animal control, not CPS. 




 Oh man, you have no idea. I just happened to press F1 in another program to open the help file, and I had to watch Notepad opens and populated with thousands of Fizz Buzz. I felt trolled so hard. 




 I don't know. Whoever convicted those guys I guess:
[List of American state and local politicians convicted of crimes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_American_state_and_local_politicians_convicted_of_crimes). 




  I never heard an answer that convinced my opponent himself

Seriously? how about: "let's throw that politician in jail and outlaw hookers and blow." Sounds like a typical liberal answer.

The concept of taxes is accepted by most people and also by many libertarians. so I don't see how giving an example of one particular wasted taxes is going to change anyone's mind. 

Everybody knows that taxes aren't 100% effective. But all the people who accept the tax concept (which is the majority of people, right after they stop bitching about it) just argue on the amount and how to spend it. 




 I just ran it fine with 10,000 iterations. I would guess it's maybe some kind of memory limitation? 

Edit: looks like mine breaks at 15K, then I'm getting garbage. I think you find the ultimate shitty program :) 




  Forwards from Grandma are literally from the wrong generation.  




 It won't be a season finale without Daenerys in the final scene.  




 I watched the show since the closed beta of the machine.  














 If you've got dropbox preloaded on your S5, just activate it and login. You should get +48GB free for 2 years. I already had 12, so now I'm at 60.  




 James damn earned it. He's probably the number 1 play maker in the league (shoot, enter or pass and great court vision). 




 I just got a new phone, so here are the apps I first installed (my essential list):

* Bacon Reader (reddit)
* Calendar (I use Google's)
* Drive   Dropbox (Dropbox gives you +48GB free storage, which is great)
* ES Explorer
* Evernote
* LastPass
* Media Monkey   Poweramp (music)
* Waze
* Whatsapp
* Yaste (XBMC/Kodi remote)
* My bank app

 Okay, you win this round. 




 20 years ago faggots wouldn't be allowed to complain about lack of serious tag.  














 Then: oh, Expanded Consciousness, probably some good shit in it, I should spend an hour to explore it.

Now: oh, Expanded Consciousness, I hope they dumb it down to gallery format, I've got 2 minutes to spare. 




  traditionally and historically

Historically I was an ape. How about we'll focus on the present now? 




  haven't done my surgery rotation yet so I don't fully know this answer

Well, OP also hasn't done her surgery rotation and she sure has a lot more confidence talking about this stuff than you, so I guess I'm gonna take her word for it. Nice try thin patriarchy. 




 Putting the Wild in Buffalo Wild Wings. 




 1 million more republicans voted for Romney than those voted for McCain. They didn't stay at home at all. If anything, Democrats stayed at home in 2012 compared to 2008. 




 I love how he does couple of flips, pause for half a millisecond and then goes: yeah what the hell, I'll do another one, I've got so much time before landing. 




 Booing from the crowd every time he holds the ball is uncalled for. 

I hate lots of players (Kobe Shaq who dominated us for 5 miserable years, Noah, Dirk and the entire Dallas team, McGrady, Carter Kidd, Artest), but that's part of the game. I wouldn't boo them for just playing ball and I really wish them best of luck (when they play against other teams, of course).  




 and a scholar.  




  Cell phone companies are trading thinness for battery size

No. Cellphone companies are trading electronics for money. They compromise battery size because they know the majority of people prefer good bright large colorful screen, fast device, big RAM, storage, good sound quality, reliable fast connecting GPS and reliable networking. All those greatly consume battery life. 

If you don't care about thick device, some popular cellphones have [battery cases](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Dmobile tag=hotoge-20 field-keywords=battery+case rh=n%3A2335752011%2Ck%3Abattery+case).

 It's weird because not wanting kids is a somewhat a deep decision that isn't reached lightly. It involves different stages of life, your spouse, sometimes parents and it also affects you financially and socially for many years...

... and /r/childfree sometimes downplays it to kids screaming for 10 minutes in a movie based on a comic book.  




 That's probably true for all years, except 2001. 









 The bike? It's custom made with Carrera's frame and XTR - [picture here](http://i.imgur.com/GZd8z8B.jpg). The only downside to me (and the reason probably for a relatively cheap price) is 26 wheels, but I can live with that. 




 I'm ashamed to admit that I stopped reading 75% through with no good reason, because I did enjoy the book. Good chance to go back and finish it. 




 Amazon has a sale on [RAVPower Element RP-PB07 10400mAh Portable Charger](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B009V5X1CE/). $16 for the 10,400mAh model (with promo code P3FFG8XA). Or the bigger model: RAVPower Deluxe 13,000mAh External Charger ($24), Promo code ZMF24RGT.

That's a good deal. 




 The Following - how is this still a thing? 




 Yeah, same here. With $1500 budget I got high-end second hand hard tail, all Carbon, 9-kg/20-pounds bikes. A real beast. 

I don't do technical rides, I prefer long marathon/endurance rides (50-75 miles) on mostly wide trails. So the bike fits me perfectly.  




  An artist is a person, before all else, and people often hold beliefs

Exactly. Even if she '"caved" in direct response to pressure' as OP wrote, that's fine, and by no means should be interpreted as a negative thing. Different people reacts differently to pressure, and she has every right to avoid difficult situations (if we assume it's a reaction and not political statement, which she obviously entitled to).

Hell, I know people that don't go to work because they have a little headache in the morning and they don't feel like standing in traffic, so why should be surprised when artists decide to dodge when a century old conflict knocks on their door.
 









 We should vote for people with real life experience, like Brian Roberts. 




 To answer seriously for a second, 'rape culture' means the socio-cultural environment encourages rape, or at least does nothing to prevent it, meaning, rape is seen as a normal act. 

I can tell this is true, because I wear suit and tie to meet clients. I'm literary raped by having to do that. Who's making me, you ask? Nobody, I'm self employed. This is how fucked and serious rape culture has become. I'm raping myself because it's what society expects of me. 




 I'm not sure what are you talking about. Create a shortcut called "Sound Playback" with the following target:

    C:\Windows\System32\rundll32.exe shell32.dll,Control_RunDLL mmsys.cpl,,0

Create ahk script that runs it:

    Run, Sound Playback.lnk

Activate the window:

    Sleep, 100
    WinWait, Sound, 
    IfWinNotActive, Sound, , WinActivate, Sound, 
    WinWaitActive, Sound, 

use arrows to select the BT device (let's assume it's 3rd on the list)

    Send, {DOWN}{DOWN}

Hit context menu, and choose disable/enable

    Send, {APPSKEY}{DOWN}{DOWN}{ENTER}

I'm sure with 10 minutes tweaking and testing this can easily be done.



 




 You are talking about 3000 years ago, so I think it's worth mentioning that according to Jewish law, 13 is the adult age, in which a boy  becomes accountable for their actions (12 for girls). The ritual is called Bar Mitzva. Part of the ritual is the father, thanking God that he's no longer responsible for his son's actions. http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/2473-bar-mizwah 




 You can probably create AHK script to do that, so you'll just need to assign it to a keyboard or desktop shortcut. 




 Twist: there are 50 pills in that box and 1 mint. The girl likes to take a chance.

 You are not a real man! the proper way of doing that is monitoring your female teacher behavior. If one of them acts irrationally, offer her a tampon and tell her she doesn't even have to thank you.

 I think his point is against the whole argument of: if something small and usually not that meaningful happens you can say goodbye to huge phenomena, that probably not single event can affect.

To say thay Clinton is a bad candidate is one thing, but to think that her election will make any dent in gender equality, for better or for worse, is a bit out of touch from reality and how social changes shape.

 There's nothing more simple than using Dropbox of Google Drive. another HUGE advantage is that both services keep old versions of your files. So if your file is suddenly corrupted (drive or software failure) or even if you accidentally deleted something, saved and regretted it - they'll have previous versions to download. It's a life saving.

 [ Kendrick Lamar - i](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aShfolR6w8) - love yourself this summer.

In Baltimor, summer started early:

They wanna say there's a war outside and a bomb in the street  
And a gun in the hood and a mob of police  
And a rock on the corner and a line full of fiends  
And a bottle full of lean and a model on a scheme, yup  
These days of frustration keep y'all on tucking rotation  
I duck these gold faces, post up fee-fi-fo-fum bases  
Dreams of realities peace  
Blow steam in the face of the beast  
The sky can fall down, the wind can cry now  
The strong in me, I still smile  

 I love myself  
(The world is a ghetto with guns and picket signs)  
I love myself  
(But it can do what it want whenever it wants and I don't mind)  
I love myself  
(He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide)  
I love myself  
(One day at the time, sun gone shine)

 Just watched Real Time and one of the guests, Dan Senor, made that comment in the title (I didn't verify it). "We are pouring tons of money into places like Baltimore. Input isn't the problem, the output is a disaster." Bad and totally ineffective government spending. 




 Absolutely. If you can love a dog, feed him and put a roof over his head - get one. It's a win win situation. Dogs are very adaptive to their owner habits. If you leave early and get home late, the dog will get used it and probably sleep comfortably the whole time.

Edit: lots of people are saying that this isn't healthy, and I agree that it's not ideal. However, I replied to someone who compared adopting a dog to a dog living in a cage. This is far better life. And yes, you got to compensate for the time you are missing:

* wake up earlier to take the dog for a walk. If you can go on an early jog, that would be great. The dog will love it. it shouldn't even be a long jog, 2 miles is a good distance for a dog. [check this chart please](http://www.runnersworld.com/sites/default/files/dogs500.jpg).
* take long walks with him at night, if it's a big dog that can run the distance (see chart above), consider using a bicycle.
* whenever you have a day off, take the dog with you, stop at the beach or at the park. 
* those are good ideas not only for the dog, but for you as well.
* consider getting a walker. Depends on where you live, those shouldn't cost much. If you can't find one, you can also talk to a kid in your neighborhood that will take the dog out after school for few bucks.

Anyway, while I hear lots of those comments and agree with them, remember that the most important thing you can for a dog is to love him, show your affection, communicate with him, feed him properly and have fun with him while you are around. so if you are busy, it might not be 100% ideal, but not everything in life is. This is still better than a dog sitting in a cage in some shelter where he feels like nobody.  




 After some digging, I think I found [Balai Maria (@balai_mari) / Instagram](https://instagram.com/balai_mari/). *and if you are looking for more pictures, try also her Russian name:   .

 As other have explained, it's a matter of percentage within population. 

There's also another (unmeasurable) issue: how much of it justifiable? I'm not talking just about the final kill, but life events. For example, if [white kids are more likely to sell drugs, but black kids are more likely to go to prison for drug charges](http://www.csdp.org/publicservice/kids.htm), then black kids are more likely to grow up as criminals and have future trouble with the law. 

So even if all police harassment is race-blind, there are still underlying issues that increases the chances of black people to be involved in such incidents. 

 




 It's like a typical dialog in a movie: "let's go out to a dinner tonight, I'll pick you up" - "sure" - both hang up. STOP, THEY DIDN'T SAY THE TIME! ^THEY ^ALSO ^NEVER ^SAY ^BYE! 




 Tru Fakt (I cannot make this shit up): most superheroes die of HIV or Heroin OD. Also, there's a steep decline in straight superheroes saving straight dudes. 




 It's not an original quote -- Michael Scott. 




 For every ingredient in the first row you can match any ingredient in the second row, so that's 5\*5 = 25 meals. For each one of those 25 meals you can add another variant from the 3rd row, so 25\*5 = 125 combos by the 3rd row, and so on. That's 5^5 = 3,125 meals 




 And [here's another variation](http://eattillyoubleed.com/2015/04/moroccan-preserved-lemons/) that was posted recently in /r/Cooking I think.

 And Nelson Mandela, contrary to popular belief, hated dildos.  














 I was talking about economic policies, was I wrong in any of the examples I gave? And yes, republicans as whole are also far from libertarianism. I mean, Rand Paul is probably the closest viable candidate, and he's polling what? [not very strong even in its own base](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/rand-paul-is-losing-his-fathers-base/). 




  what's wrong with requiring an ID to vote

There's nothing wrong with ID all by itself. However, in the current social environment and ID issues, lack of ID targets very specific demographics. 

If, let's say, there's a major move to provide everyone with ID ([like many other countries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_identity_card_policies_by_country#Countries_with_compulsory_identity_cards)), then it would be reasonable to force ID when voting after a grace period of few years. 




   I consider myself a libertarian but I don't see much distance

Well, his economic views are as far from libertarianism as possible. 

I mean he's mostly against free trade, pro minimum wage, pro workers rights by law, heavy wallstreet regulation, etc. and there's the government intervention/stimulation angle which most Libertarian economists are against.

I'm don't mean to phrase them as bad policies, that's up to debate. But overall, don't expect much love at /r/Libertarian. 




 I meant as a core. Obviously some of running gags will aim at younger audience (those following him) and some will aim at older audience (those staying at that slot). 

Anyway, he might surprise, who knows. The last attempt to shake things a bit was by Conan at NBC and it didn't work well, they didn't have the patience. It's an expensive slot.  




 loyal3 is a broker that allows buying partial shares? if so, it's a bit different, because it's a virtual holding. You probably trade those shares with the broker and not with the exchange.
