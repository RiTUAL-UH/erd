 Hi, I'm the Holiday Armadillo! 
























 Imagine a reddit paint fight day. One in every major city around the world! 




 Agreed! That would be amazing!

 Luminaeus, that made me laugh for a good five minutes. Thank you!! 




 StickDoctor, you have made my day. Thank you very much! I look forward to helping you when I can! 




 Haha! I was thinking [this!](http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20101015151248/muppet/images/0/05/Beaker.jpg)

 Oh, great Sega5! If you find any more of his work can you tag it here?

 This dog is not born that way. He spent major part of his growth years cramped inside a small cage and his body couldn't develop. Last year he was found roaming in the streets of France and the very good news is that he got adopted by a very animal loving family.

 And just like that, Phil knew he'd never be the same. The friends he thought he had had violated his trust and preyed upon his trusting nature. The change in him happened as fast as an electrical pulse. At that moment, he was no longer Phil; he had become what the world now knows as Insanity Wolf! 




 Some say he's a mystery wrapped in an enigma

 Perfect! Thank you for your help!  




 That's a great idea, thanks! I'm so glad I asked, most of these things I have never heard of!  




 Oh, perfect - that's a big help! Thank you! 




 Thank you /u/lilypetal! I love your suggestion about natural sunlight, I will have to rearrange our room but I think I can work it. And I hadn't thought about the spills, either. I imagine that as nice as a wood finish would look it would be horrible for stains.   




 Hi ladies of /r/makeupaddiction! I need your help.

My fianc's birthday is coming up, and I thought the perfect gift would be to buy or put together a make up battlestation for her. I am willing to spend a lot of time on it, and my budget is not really capped.

In terms of advice, I'm really looking for ideas on what features you'd like in your own make up stations and how to go about sourcing the materials. Mirror styles and types, storage zones (make up and jewelery potentially?), shelving, new make up to buy her to include and the physical design of the entire thing. The area I have available is a space of about 2.5m x 1m. 

Pictures of your own dedicated make up areas would be appreciated as well as I really have no idea what I'm up against.

You are all amazing, THANK YOU!
 




 Am I the only one frustrated by the fact that the ball's initial track down the first ramp isn't smooth?

 No, I don't think he minds to much. He knows anything on Facebook is public domain. It was more of a hilarious shock I think! 




 He uploaded it to his Facebook, next minute he sees himself in this ad! He did message them, [here's what they replied](http://i.imgur.com/AANaL5E.png)

 I'm trying to figure out who they've approached to perform. 




 That would be amazing. 




 Good answer! I think they may be a bit over the top for a work conference though. 




 I was thinking Gaga...but she's performing somewhere else that night.

 Interestingly, Mongolians call him Chinggis Khan. 'Genghis' is a poor Anglicization from back in the day. 




 Teehee! Thanks /u/Lestefania I thought it was a great find! 




 Great tips /u/thiscnidocyte. I think the focuses should be lighting and organization. Definitely a step up from beside the toothbrushes in the bathroom! 




 Thanks /u/wannabebaker101! I love the organizer idea, definitely a must! I've also bought a chair to go with, [it's here!](http://i.imgur.com/PHwE11f.png) 




 Ahh just the advice I was after! Thanks /u/reallycoolpeople. I was thinking of somehow installing a row of bulbs around the outer mirror and possibly adding a magnifying vanity mirror. 




 Interesting! I read that before the commercial jet was rolled out (1952), turbulence could be incredibly violent as aircraft were powered by pistons instead of jet engines and there was no cabin pressurization. 






















































 Agreed, but I think using the word 'curvy' sounds a lot nicer than 'obese'. It would be nice if everyone used curvy to describe actual body shape instead of being overweight, but it seems it's the go-to descriptor. 




 This reads like a Dr Suess book. Green eggs and hambeast?

 Still hilarious 









 Thanks for your kind words Pickles. Too many times I've seen her sit on the floor and do her make up in the mirror on our wardrobe door! No longer :) 




 Oh, I'll try! A reaction shot would be great! 




 Thanks jen-iscool - I really hope she likes it! I bought it online from an Auction house interstate and as soon as I saw it I knew it was the one!
 




 Thanks eredd11 :) there's only one thing missing; a magnifying mirrored vanity mirror, and I've arranged for her mother to give it to her. 




 You're too kind bridget992. I'm hoping she likes it - she gets home from work in 3 hours! 




 Thank you erixxi! I couldn't have done it without everyone's advice!

 The situation at Martin Place in Sydney remains an ongoing one, and one from which very little concrete evidence has emerged. In fact, a statement aired on the ABC - "All we know is a crime is taking place" - remains the truest assessment of the events thus far.

And yet, here we are with this - a rushed out special 2pm print edition of the Daily Telegraph containing potentially one of the most vile, deliberately inflammatory, fundamentally wrong and wholly speculative front covers in the sordid history of Australian print media.

 This looks like it's straight from the marshes of the first 'The Witcher' game 




 I don't think so. The coverage that post got was absolutely insane. 




 Nope. Although I was very careful to remain anonymous, not name names and only paint the event in a positive light. As soon as it went viral new agencies simply scooped up gossip from social media on which it was rampant. 




  I can't have fun so no one can have fun 




 Hi Captainbosspirate,

(1) This was not a Christmas party. This is an annual occasion just to have fun, and to raise money for charity.
(2) Partners are invited to the end of year balls.

Please stop having a whinge, it was all in good fun.

 Dunder-Mifflin...how did you know? 




 Of course...that's what we use here in Australia 
























 I could, but I would need to ship it internationally to me here in Australia. The P650SE was appealing to me, but I was under the impression the base model didn't include hard drives or operating system, and when I added these in the price difference wasn't big. Also, I need a 17" screen. Thanks for the tip though! 




 Interesting. I wonder how much longer we have left...

 Nicely done ;)

 Hi all, trying to decide whether the extra ~$400 is worth it to upgrade to the [P37W](http://www.gigabyte.com.au/products/product-page.aspx?pid=5349) from the lead in [P37K](http://www.gigabyte.com.au/products/product-page.aspx?pid=5375). The laptops are not cheap so I am trying to keep it reasonable. I specifically need a relatively high powered, thin gaming machine with internal optical drive at a min 17" screen.

From what I can see, the only difference is the upgrade from a [GTX 965M](http://www.notebookcheck.net/NVIDIA-GeForce-GTX-965M.134120.0.html) to a GTX 970M in the P37W. According to GPUBoss, the 970M is up to 35% more powerful, has a larger memory bus and higher clock speed.

Does anyone have an opinion as to whether the GPU upgrade would be worth the extra cash? I'd love some help. Also, please let me know if I am overthinking things and the 965M is perfectly solid.

Thanks!

 Hmm yes I see, fair enough. Thanks for your opinion. 




 Really though? From the urgency of his unplanned AMA yesterday it's clear he takes this pretty seriously. 




 Question from the uneducated: What do you think GabeN is doing now? Do you think he's having emergency meetings, firing people who made the paywall decisions and generally sitting there thinking 'fuck, this situation is completely fucked!' What are his options now for getting the masterrace community back onside? Can he basically scrap this whole thing, apologise and start over?
