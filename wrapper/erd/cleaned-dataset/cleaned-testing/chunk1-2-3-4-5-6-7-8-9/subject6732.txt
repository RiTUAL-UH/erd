 Just yesterday I have seen this quote being credited to Anne Frank! 




 Yes, Gitanjali is absolutely *the* place to start Tagore. 




 They're really worthy.. especially Kindle Paperwhite, which has an inbuilt light as well... Amazon has provided many many classics in Kindle format for free.. That's really something worth mentioning and worth respecting.. It has an AMAZING and flaunty life.. And the best part (although not accurately a moral point) about Kindle is you don't have to really *buy* the books in Kindle editions.. You can just download those ebooks in *.mobi* format from torrents.. I mean, come on, we all download stuff from internet! 




 A couple of years ago, I was introduced to the real beauty of words through *Gitanjali* by Tagore. (And that day I understood what kind of Literary art forms are awarded Nobels in Literature)

Have you people read that book..? If so, how you liked it?? 




 very fuckin funny!! 




 Oh fuuuuuuckkk!!! It's awesome :D :D :D 




 Camerlengo Carlo Ventresca from *Angels and Demons* by Dan Brown 




 **STEPHEN KING IS A GREAT WRITER.** 




  it relates to the themes of finding beauty and meaning in the dull American suburbs. 

Does Beauty mean trying to work out and develop body so that he can fuck his daughter's classmate??

(Although, I liked the part when he doesn't fuck her at the end..) 









 Too good!! 




 Yeah great thought definitely.. The actual source was Thoreau's very influential essay **Walking**. 









 Well, that's a very good TIL stuff! Thanks.. 




 I guess, that's because they're too busy trying to be funny in their comments in order to get up-voted.  




 care to explain, anybody?? 




 no words!! 




 Oh wow.. you gave there a whole new website for quoted pictures.... lovely!!!  




 Awesome!! JUst outstanding... 




 thank you so much for posting this here.. awesome post!! 




 this quote is directly going to my twitter right now.... 




 Something!! 




 "He didnt like what he had seen so far of moneys influence, and who could blame him? So far as he could see, money corrupted whatever it touched. Money kept his mother waiting for buses that never came and prevented him from attending schools that could have brought out the best in him. Money put people on different levels, in a way he found unnatural.  And money caused people to forget the right reasons for doing a thing." ~Michael Lewis, NEXT 




 [These](http://www.rstudio.com/faq-items/connect-rstudio-oracle-database/) might help. Sorry, if they don't. 




 [This](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/files/scicomp/Dloads/RProgramming/BestFirstRTutorial.pdf) is the tutorial that I was following.. and 3rd chapter knocked me down.

Any help would be much appreciated.

 




 Interesting. The quote, and its author, Friedrich Nietzsche, both are interesting.  




 I put quotation marks around the word finished because I've discovered that finishing a fiction writing project is not like finishing a cheeseburger. I've had to come to a point where I am at some acceptable equilibrium between "I want this to be perfect" and "I can't fucking look at this thing again

Very well put.. Might as well start a new sub with the name r/AspiringWriterProblems 

*Hey, I mean it, ah!* 




 Since my childhood, something about sky always interested me.. The mystery in there, in the eternal space has kept me enchanted and left me wondering about what dwells there and beyond. Now, once and for all, I want to take interest in Astronomy.. please suggest me where to start. (by the way, I'm 25 and from India) 









 Well, that's a pretty fucked up attitude for a growing future citizen of this world!  




 That's shit sad.. really.  




 Isn't it great to be a nerd!! Using the mind, keeping it focused for something worthy... I can only feel sorry for those who thinks bullying them is fun!!  




 So can they be just beaten up by other kids??.. Is *that* a good social acumen for them?? 




 In what ways? 









 See this is what reasoning sometimes does.. ruins the feel out of it.. Anyways, we won't do any *bioluminescence* for whatever worthy we want to burn in our lives.. so we can be fine with the quote! 









 In such case, the best part would be to rather talk.. Speak in English with someone who is good at it and ask them to correct you whenever you err. As this goes on, you will not only become good at grammar but also the correctness in grammar will become a part of your sub-conscious; and with this, you will even realize and catch errors (if any) in something that you read or write.. 

When I was learning English language in my school days, we were not allowed to speak in any regional language(I'm from India). So, that is how I learned English, by talking it and correcting it whenever I erred.

Listen to audio books as well.. It will be very helpful!

Good Luck :) 




 * **On Writing** by Stephen King 
* **The Elements of Style** by William Strunk

are the most famous of all... 
 




 I too am an aspiring writer from a country where English is not the official language, India.. Luckily enough, I was able to pursue all my education in English medium all along.. 

Ok, now coming to the *Writing* part. To write a well is an art. And to create art, you ought to be *inspired..*  As you're saying that you're interested in writing, I would suggest you to recognize the kind of writing that inspires you... You should take it from the very basic level..

*Start reading quotes*, lots of quotes from lots of authors.. And I'm sure that will inspire you.. and then alongside, think back into your own past experiences that you feel are vital for your life, and try writing small quotes/sentences about them, whatever they would be, just write a sentence about it. Once you start doing this regularly, you will not only feel like writing more of them, but you will also unconsciously strive to write them more beautifully.. That's how you start recognizing the preciousness of the **art** that you possess.

And once you do that, you will automatically get to know what more to do to improve your style, flow and simplicity in putting the words together.. When you're well into such process, you will eventually build up confidence and you will know what would be the purpose of your writing.

This is what I learned by practicing writing since past 4 years.. I started with writing blogs (began with Blogger, and after all this time, recently switched to Medium.com).. At the begining, my writings had lots of grammatical errors, but after all these years, I'm able to write better, with very less grammatical errors, and above all, with a more inspired spirit in my writing.

*Note*: Read more. Once when you start reading quotes from the books, and when you stumble upon a really really really grand quote or sentence, sit back and think what would've resulted somebody in writing such a sentence.. and then try to read the book which the quote came from... This way you will understand the context behind beautiful words and sentences and believe me, you will desire to create such onces youself.

Even after doing all this, if your skill or ability as a writer doesn't change or advance, tell me, I will give you my address.. you can come and kill me! 




 If you're a girl, gift me this and I will marry you :D 




 Awesome!!!! :D 




 I didn't had to read *Harry Potter* when I was a teenager, but I did.. So when I had faced ethical problems later in my years, where I could've reacted unethically, I opted not to be so. I was good, because I chose to be. Reading those books taught me to be that way.

That's what this quote means.. *It says that something from the books you read will surely stick within your heart and will determine the way you will walk in the path of life when faced with adversities!*  




 Always liked this quote!! 




 Yeah.. the conflict itself loses sense without the Time thing!! 









  How much creativity was lost to WW2?

An interesting and thoughtful point, indeed! 




 World is a small place, pal! 




 Alongside loving books, I'm also an avid lover of book covers... If any of you have any favourite book covers or collected albums of them, plz do share them here. I really really want to look at the best bookcovers in the world!!

Thanks :) 




 Watching movies is fine... but I seriously think you should read books... any normal person who can't go out for a couple of years would sit and watch movies, because it is *easy*... 

**Don't be easy!**

Read books... and if you can do that you'll be proud of these two years more than any couple of years in your entire life... and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/books/) is where you would want to go if you pick up the habit.

(I'm not suggesting you to not watch movies at all, of course you should... all I meant was when you look back, I don't want you to have only *watching movies* as a significant pastime, that is all).

All the best, pal! 




  Every five years, like clockwork, I think of what an asshole I was five years ago

This is so cool one.. and

Before I do anything, I ask myself "would an idiot do that?" If they would, then I do not do that thing. -Dwight

 Well, there is always a search engine these days, isn't there, pal! 




 That's the beauty of it!! 




 Some places on the internet this quote was widely attributed to Will Smith. 




 Very funny!! 




 Something! 




 This quote, even in the least bit, doesn't talk about fishing literally... So, you're peace from Fishing isn't going to be touched by this quote.. Chill :) 




 It is a metaphor that says people live all their lives doing things they are not even conscious about, they just survive and pass days in their lifetime... and then finally after their time is done, they go away without knowing what they lived for all this time.. 









 Oh.. OK.. I was just tying that in Reddit.. didn't do so in R itself. But thanks anyways.. Didn't knew this before :) 




 I'm a very newbie to R. I just found out that there are numerous datasets inbuilt into R's *datasets* package.

but when I tried to access them, I don't see anything.
For ex: when I type

data(Nile) //I have this 'Nile' dataset in the package

The data present inside it is not being visible. The prompt just goes to next line, and nothing happens. But in online examples they got the data when they typed a datasets name like: data(phones)

Any idea why am I not getting the data? 




 I like the way you presented it... like in UNIX :) 




 Oh How much I love this kind of posts!!!

 awesome!

 Hey this is cool....!! 




 Deep! 




 Too deep.... depressingly deep, but at one corner, inspiring.
Thank you so much for posting it. 




 I think I read the book in a hurry... But yeah lots of great quotes.. 




 Nailed it, dude! 




 Life is weird. You go from being strangers. To being friends. To being more than friends. To being practically strangers again.

This is very nice. 




 That's a very thoughtful sentence!! 




 Good guy M.. 




 Stabbing sharp! I think it's really unfair to post such a great quote without crediting its writer.. So, I just found out that it is written by **Naeem Callaway.** 




 Just what I need... that too from my favourite non-ficition author!! 




 Funny.. but makes sense! 




 Deep! 




 Philip is one of a kind!! 




 Can somebody explain this?? 




 If it smells like shit everywhere you go, you better check your shoes. 

Very nice..

honey why is this whiskey bottle half empty? because you are a pessimist

Well, that's being too frank to your face. Awesome ofcourse!

Very nice list, friend! Thank you.. You should make more of these...

 I was actually thinking to do this specially for Gone Girl.. I was spellbound by Trent   Ross for their work in *The Social Network* and I'm also enjoying *Gone Girl* now... 




  8tracks

Never heard of this.. Will surely try.. Sounds interesting what you did. 




 Wow.. what a post... I really do... Moreover, I imagine and hum in my mind some Hollywood OSTs when reading some of the most important and influencing aspects in a story... It feels seriously enriching experience.... 




 I recently finished reading Michael Crichton's PREY.. and the closing line was deeply provoking:

"*They didn't understand what they were doing.*

I'm afraid that will be on the tombstone of the human race."



I felt interested in asking you people about such touching closing lines from other books.. Let's post/share such lines. Thanks! 




 I've very recently starting my career with first job by working with Informatica ETL processes.. I'm keenly interested in Data Science.. So, I want to ask you if there a way for me to eventually make a switch into Data Science? What is the necessary skill set that I would need to do so, and is working in Informatica tool going to be of any help to me in the journey towards being a Data Scientist?? 














 1984. It is said to be a timeless classic book in English Literature..  I started it some time long ago, nearly more than a month ago and am still not able to finish it. For me it is surely not a page turner. I'm just keeping up with it still because I feel bad when I start a book and decide not to finish it, so am just trying to read it page by page and find out if I can realize why it is such a classic.

There are many instances in the plot that seemed really senseless.. Winston, Julia and O'Brien... there is no proper relation between how they develop their opinions and feelings that they have for one another.. Why Julia loves Winston and a lot more such loose ends..

Can somebody please tell me why this 1984 is a classic?? 




 A dystopian time period... people living by a set of strange rules and practices... the protagonist character also lives as one among them all.... and then eventually he starts thinking differently... and then a girl character enters the story and that stirs him for even more revolutionary ideas and actions that protest against those time period socially accepted customs... 

I have observed the same plot line in very well known classics Fahrenheit 451, 1984, and also a novella Anthem (by Ayn Rand)... 

Now, why is that??  














 Truth be told, I'm heavily influenced by Inception film.. Ever since then, I am interested in lucid dreaming concepts.. I've tried to come up with interesting story lines... but whenever I start writing something.. After some time, inevitably I ask myself "How is this different from Inception, anyways?? Why would people want to read this when they've already seen all this in Inception?"

So I want to ask you people: Is it really possible to write a lucid-dreams fiction, whose concepts would appear new, while most of it is already covered in the Inception film in a very grand manner???

Please help me... 














 For me, it's every line from *The Social Network*. Every freakin' line, I tell you!

If I've to be really precise, I would pick:


"It's raining."

"I'm sorry."

"It just started raining." 




 I'm an aspiring writer, and I thought myself to be a fine amateur at Writing. But just today I came across [Medium](http://medium.com) and it was great, but the content I saw there overwhelmed me. Honestly and shamelessly saying, friends, looking at what and how good people are writing there, I found myself being far far from their quality. I'm deeply depressed from all the content I saw there and am feeling very underconfident about my Writing skills. Can somebody please help me?? Thank you! 




 Whenever I come across some books that have started a new sub-genre kind of thing in themselves (eg: Cyberpunk, Quantum Fiction and etc..) I feel very motivated.. I'm an aspiring writer and I want to write very different books that would completely stand out from the mainstream conventions of sci-fi or any categorizations of literature.. 

Any tips on how to invent a new genre/sub-genre in Writing??
 




 I'm reading **The Undercover Economist** by Tim Harford.. I'm a novice to economics, but am interested in learning it. So I picked up this book and am reaching its end right now. But there are many things in that book that left me in dark, many concepts seemed very unclear to me, especially the concepts like how game theory is used in auctions and lot more such things from that book. I understood some concepts very well and now am looking at those things differently in everyday reality. So, I want to also get the gist  of those concepts that I didn't understand clearly when I read them from the book. Can somebody please provide me with a link that has a detailed chapter vise summary of the book or any of your personal analyses of them?? It would be of *GREAT* help if you people can do that for me. Thank you! 




 All mylife I've been great at nothing, only good and ok at a few things. I'm very much fed up with such life style. I want to know how can i remove this mediocrity from my life forever. Tell me what kind of things I would need to do en route this path. (By the way, my ambition in life is to become a *great* writer! ) 




 The way the character Jordan Belfort talks in the movie is simply outstanding and really captivating.. the confidence in his words, his body language, his aggression, the articulation -- all in all his way of speech is everything that a person with "I-want-to-win-the-world" attitude needs!

I'm really impressed by all that.. I want to talk like him... How do I do that?? Any ideas and suggestions?? (By the way, I'm an Indian!) 




 Ive finished 100 days of abstinence and there is a specific viewpoint of mine that I want to portray today to the members of this brotherhood about the subject at hand, *the addiction.*

Along this time, Ive only, or at least mostly, seen people referring to masturbation as a completely negative thing in their lives and it ruining their vital time. People say its a demon that stops ones development in life and so should be killed. *I dont agree.* It should not be ended; it should rather be fought and conquered but never despised and killed, never; because the real meaning of victory is not killing but conquering. After all, what would we, the powerful Humans, the soldiers who man the eternal Universe residing within each of us, do if there is no worthy opponent, if there is nothing standing between us and the ambitions we carry in our hearts? You can trek to the heights and watch the horizons only when there are mountains present in your way and blocking the view. So, I say your addiction (to masturbation or anything else) is not a prison that locks you up but a gym that strengthens you; and of course strength is only enjoyable when it is tested, not when it is rested. So it tests you, it weakens you, it hits you in the face, it hits you in the heart, it provokes you to fight back, and in the process it makes you stronger, it makes you brave, it makes you familiar to the hurdles again and again in the form of ups and downs, crests and troughs, so that when you encounter greater ones ahead in your life, you dont fear them anymore. Addiction can be an ocean of pleasure; you either learn to swim it and enjoy the dive, or fall straight in and drown away into its depth; choice is yours; and in both the above cases, ocean is not to the blame. A gymnasium is presented to you but working out in there is solely your duty. Don't offend your addictions, overrun them.

After 100 days of staying away from PMO, especially masturbation, this is all Ive realized about it. I wont hate it, I cant hate it; because it gave me intense pleasure since my puberty and I cant deny that. So, I stopped seeing it as an enemy, I never saw it as an enemy, I only saw it as a competitor, as an opponent, who irks me to dare win against it. 

I started my abstinence not at all because I was an addict of masturbation, but because its very valuable and enjoyable to me and I wanted to sacrifice such blissful pleasure for a goal that I took up in my life, like leaving the joy and comfort of home and going to the war to achieve my goal. That day was the start, and today it is 100 days; and this is just the beginning. 

*Thank you all, for your unstopping support to many brothers like me here, justifying the name, a brotherhood!* 




 Last year I had A lot of free time.. so I managed to read some 35 books in that year.. that's the biggest number ever for me, till date. Now I'm into my first job theses days. Moved into a new city and new time shcedules and stuff liek that... But these days, after entering into the actual career I'm observing that I'm not reading like before at all... I'm unable to enjoy the reading like before, too. My reading list has increased massively. I love to read, I bought more 20 books from a bookslae and lot of ebook downloads for my Kindle, but besides all this I'm not understadning these new changes in my reading habit and how to cope up with it.. Any suggestons and views?? 




 I see only boys making posts and replying the threads over here. I am wondering if this page is having only male members.. and eventually that made me question myself if we, the MEN, are the weakest Human species when it comes to lust related activities, which is why we needed a whole internet community here to abstain ourselves from PMO!!

Do girls ever, like *EVER*, suffer this PMO related things like us, at all?? 




 Recently there was a conservation going on with my friend about porn and masturbation and I mentioned to him that I took break from all those things. 

Friend: Why don't you masturbate?

Me: Just like that, took a break for a while.

Friend: Whatever happens won't you masturbate?

Me: No. I won't.

Friend: What if a very sexy girl comes to you? You won't fuck her? 

Me: No.

Friend: Won't you even masturbate thinking about her?

Me: No.

Friend: Why? Don't you have a dick??

Me: *I do. And I also have dignity in my dick.*




I felt very good about myself after I said. 




 I've always had this doubt inside my mind and now I started watching Carl Sagan's **Cosmos** hence this rose again in me. Now I can't stop asking this to the world, once and for all:

When we talk about the Cosmic entities such Planets, Solar Systems, Stars, Galaxies and etc, we talk in light years.. We, the human beings never even have set foot on the farthest planet even in our own solar system, but we diligently talk of numerous Galaxies apart from our own as if we have a crystal clear knowledge of them. 

When we haven't been to any of the other planets or to any farther than our own solar system, how the hell can we say that we are this much far this this galaxy and that much far from that galaxy??

 Not just that, anything and everything that is being told about the cosmic universe by our science, how can we be so sure about it all?? For example, in the Cosmos TV Series, *Ryan Nebula* is said to be **ONLY** 1500 Light Years away from Earth.. How on earth can we even envision, sitting here on this planet, about something that requires one to travel for 1500 years at the speed of light?? 

How in the world do we know all these things? I beg for the answers!!

 




 I'm a blogger and book reader.. For some of my future ventures I need an extensive knowledge of various systems, including how the society works, how an organization works, how corporate works and stuff like that.. So,  I want to start observing them and learn from them. But there is so much that happens around them all that I often get lost in thinking what to observe and take into account. 

Can somebody pleaes suggest what kind of observations of the world or a system are vital for understanding those systems in depth? 




 Although all sci-fi movies aren't good, their sound tracks can sometimes be captivating. I'm collecting such grand and enigmatic tracks from sci-fi movies. Please give out the names of those movies that you've felt as having great sci-fi tracks.

My personal favourites: TRON Legacy, Oblivion, Inception...

 I love to read books.. and then one day, just like that, I also discovered erotica (erotic stories) and started to love the kinky ones..!! I would even go further and say that I was once addicted to them than to the actual porn.. 

Now, I'm into NoFapping.. I'm on my 70+ days without fapping. But recently, as I started exploring Reddit, I found those subreddits that are very closely related to the kind of erotica I used to read.. and was kinda into them for a couple of days on the weekend.. I broswed through lot of captioned pictures on reddit and some real life stories...

I realized this is wrong too and am again trying to keep myself away from them like I did when started NoFapping a couple of months ago, although I didn't reset my badge right now because I **did not** masturbate at all!!

So, plz tell me does reading erotica, watching related captioned pictures and feeling aroused comes under Porn?? 




 I love to read a lot and I also chose to do so in my life because my future dreams are related to me reading varaciously. But I don't read so fast like many poeple and that makes me low sometimes.. Any of you with similar issues, friends?  I would like to be helped with some suggesstions too!! 




 I very recently bought 'Mein Kampf' by Adolf Hitler, published by Wilco Classics. It was a leather bound edition for a very less price, for just Rs.275 (less than $6). I was impressed by the hard binding, quality of the paper and the print. Out of curiosity I then browsed for other books from Wilco. Fortunately, I found lot of other books, all leather bound/hard cover editions and at prices even lesser than the one I mentioned above.

But to my surprise, none of the books are rated/reviewed (in Amazon). This made me wonder whether these books from Wilco Classic Library are of people's interest or not.

What do you people think of them?? Are there any particular disadvantages if one collects Wilco Classic editions?? 




 I see a number beside people's posts and comments in this NoFap section.. Can somebody tell what that represents?? In case it is the number of days the subscriber is away from fapping, is there any way that I can start the number from 60 plus, because i've been away masturbating since a couple of months.. To look at the number of days is kinda inspiring and encouraging to continue that way!!  





























 The narrator seems to be too biased and at times even came out as an asshole.

The type of girl who "went to college," but majored in communications and sleeping with professors.

I told you, the 'asshole' type of thinking, it is especially because of the above sentence. It felt like the most judgemental sentence I've read in the recent days. Even grammer didn't seem fit for that repelling sentence: *majored* (past tense) and then *sleeping* (continous tense). I'm not sure if that's right (I'm not native in English) but I'm having a feeling that its not, because the sentence sure sounds very wrong grammatically as well. 




 Rest In Peace, sir! 




 Today when I was practicing Sudharshana Kriya, I observed, or rather experienced, one profoundly simple realization. When I dived deep into the breathing pattern at the end of the Kriya process, there came one frozen frame in time, Im calling it the *Moment*, where I realized what present moment means. 

At that one frame of time (I refer to it as a frame of time because I dont want to give it a unit of measurement, like the *second,* and make it sound quantifiable) everything in my life, both the past and the future seemed to be unified, aligned in one straight line telling me what I have been doing all my life has led me to this moment and what I do now will lead me further.

*We live not thinking about the past or dreaming about the future. Although theyre necessary at times, we sure create them both with the building blocks of present.*

I know, this is not a new concept, but the way I experienced it, deep down in meditation, had impacted me more, like never before. I guess what made this more influential is an activity I undertook the day before. I decided to take up Zen, which is all about experiencing the moment as you live through it. 

Dots do connect.

And I understood the singularity of life.
 




 I thought I knew life. 




 World is a small place.. and at the same time big too :) 




 I am actually waiting for this pic to turn up.. I collected it long back but am unable to find it... Now I got it again through this post.. thank you so very much :) :) 




 I watched the movie 4 times and I gave only one reason for doing so: *I deserved every bit of that film* :) 




 Hey pal.. thank you so much for the creative critique... The things you pointed out are very helpful for me to improve.. Thank you so much :) :) 




 And also, I think that quote in the title doesn't say the same thing as compared to the one I thought to be the correct version. The title quote emphasizes that the things that you worry about do happen in real.. and thus you worrying about them is justified.

But in the one that I commented, it says we worry about things that are not going to happen.. thus not justifying our worries.

Lot of difference! 




  The quote in the title says pretty much the same thing, but is more witty and sounds like something Twain might have said or written.

Ironically I too felt the same way about the corrected version in the comment I gave. Funny! 




 Makes great sense. Thanks :) 




 Good one :) 




 I guess the quote actually reads: "I've lived through some terrible things in my life, some of which **never** happened."

He was talking about how worrying about the things that might go wrong is actually worse than those things themselves. I can't point out to the source, but I sure remember Twain telling it this way. 

It makes sense.
 




 Hey thank you for the critique.. I incorporated the changes pointed out by you.. Thanks a lot once again :) :) 




 Hey thanks for pointing out the things that made this piece unimpresseive to you.. Yes in this piece rather than a full story or a conflict. I just tried to write about some mystic encounters of a person with a light that he saw in his dreams which mysteriously tranformed him and made him get better at things that were bothering him. It's like a magical medicine that he doesn't know where it was coming from.

I will keep your review in mind and shall practice on with the aspects you mentioned.

Thank you so much, Kalteras :) :) 




 Thank you so very much, pal, for such a helpful review.. All those things that you pointed out, especially comma things, will definetly help me get better. Commas always confuse me so much.. Any suggestions there??

 I'm honestly surprised how well this is written for being non-native! Can I ask how long you've been writing in English? 

Thank you so much for the compliment. I've been writing in English for four years now. Mostly I wrote blogs and articles (but with lot of errors, I now realize), never serious ficiton though except for a couple of short stories. Tried my hand at writing real fiction in the past but didn't work so kept it on hold. Now I felt that it is time I took it up seriously. So here I am writing flash fiction for practice. 
 
 I think fix up this stuff 

Yes, I just did.. I wholeheartedly thank you so very much for the help :) 




 I will just critique like a reader himself who can also write. I'm not a native English speaker, I'm from India:

* In the opening line, the word 'exactly' being used multiple times slightly made the sentence a bit pretentious. Try changing that, if you can.

 He had huge hands, so long that if it stretched it, it would go through the walls and..
 
I think it should be "He had huge hands, so long that if he (you just mentioned the monster as a He) stretched them (plural, *hands* - right) they would go (plural again.)

 So thats why it sat on its toes,

Hmm, fine. But maybe sitting on its (or his, I'm not sure. its is fine though) knees would do better, I guess.

 It was just sitting there staring at me, **with its eyes**,

I don't think that emphasizing that it is staring at you with its eyes is necessary. Everything in the universe looks with its eyes only, no!

 They looked like ordinary human eyes except they were extremely yellow, and instead of a pupils it had a lightings, opening a persons mind into another world, most people called it a nightmare, but to me it was a dreamland.

Good and important sentence, but first of all it's too long, without easy readability and also grammatical errors. Singular - Plural mostly ('a pupils', 'a lighting's' - just pupils - no a, 'a' makes it singular; same for lightings - no a and also no apostrophe, I guess). But I would say instead of 'lightings' find a better word. May be *sparks.*

 Most children at that age liked to go to the

Most children at *my* age  - would've done better, because a moment later you're bringing that point onto you, saying that you like staring at it rather. So, this seemed better. 

 So I told my mother, she embraced me, and told me that monsters dont exist.

Embraced is not establishing your point here. You can expand this point. Because it's an important one. It is showing that he was not believed by people. So, this can be better I guess: "So, I told my mother. She looked back at me with a calm and unsurprised but an understanding look in her eyes. She took me close and hugged me, and said that monsters dont exist."

I don't know if you like my description but it I'm trying to tell you that this is an important moment in the story and so finishing it so justly wouldn't do good.

 refusing to neither eat nor drink anything until I saw the monster again.

It's *either - or*. Because you already said *refusing* which is a negative, and *neither - nor* is again a negative. No double negatives.

 As a kind hearted mother she couldnt bare it, she refuse to believe me.

It's bear - not bare. And refused. 

Ended the story well. Overall, I liked the story. It's very good. I like such fantastic and mystic incidents put into words. And coming to your writing. I sense that English is not your native language. It's not mine too, like I mentioned at the beginning. So, you have some grammatical errors. Needed correcting. But after the sentence "As a kind hearted mother she couldnt bare it, she refuse to believe me." Everything went too fast. Situations aren't established well. Maybe you can take a second look on that.

overall it's a 7/10 for the storyline. English is to be improved grammatically.

But I'm having a feeling that you're going to do a lot better in the coming days. In some ways, I see myself in you. I see my own writing in yours. We can all improve and we should -  we will.

All the very best... And once again, Good story.. keep it up :)



[And hey, now a quick tip about posting in this Sub. Do select a **flair** for your story, like a genre. Yours can be *Fantasy*, I guess. And also critique others' stories. Else they put you into Leeching (they already did, which is why I'm telling this. Normally leeched posts are ignored by members here.) which means you're a freeloader over here, taking critiques but never giving them back to others. I faced it last week. You please don't. You wrote a good story.]
 




 This is my second flash fiction. (I'm from India and English is not my native language. But I love this language which is why I made writing in it as my life's purpose.) Here, I tried to voice out the character's mystic experiences in his life. I didn't emphasize in this piece on the name of the character or his environment or such minute daily life details, but on his internal voice. And it's also written in first person.  Please critique it in whatever way you think will be helpful for improving my fiction-writing skill. I'm open to all your comments.Thank you, all :)

                                                       THE VAGUE LIGHT

It is said that you shouldnt chase butterflies; rather you should sit down and wait for them to come to you. Well, I didnt chase butterflies, but all my life I had chased a light, a particular light that I saw in my dreams. 

The light appeared for the first time in my dream when I was a child. I remember that day because I was laughed at by the entire class for failing in the 5th grade Math exam. After that night, after I saw that light in my dream, Math ceased to scare me anymore. The light didnt make me a genius in Math, but it did stop me from being scared of it. In a way, it protected me.

Eventually, I turned 16, and got my first rejection from a girl I liked in my neighborhood. I asked her out on my birthday. She took it for a joke but when I told her I meant it she felt annoyed and stopped talking to me. I liked her very much, the rejection bothered me. And then one night, that light appeared again in my dreams. From the day after, looking at that girl never troubled me. 

There came a time when I needed a job desperately. I was 24. I couldnt get any job due to the financial meltdown that hit the world hard. I felt like a loser looking at all the comfortable parts of peoples lives, and wondered why I always reside on the other side of the things that I wished in my life. I didnt find an answer because at the moment finding a job felt more reasonable than finding answers to the unanswerable questions of life. So, I restarted my job search, and yet after months time nothing seemed to be changing. I became weaker at heart with each email response I never got from the companies I applied for. I started believing in all the bad things in the world that happen to good people. I had always thought that I was one of those good people and now my current situation in life only confirmed it.

Not finding a job made me unhappy and dissatisfied. Happiness and satisfaction in life can be measured in the amount of peaceful sleep one gets every night. If you can go to bed and sleep without anything bothering you, youre a happy man. I used to sleep happily every night, holding in mind the dreams for my future, but now I held only despair. Night by night my sound sleep moved farther and farther away, but it left the sound part behind for me, the sound of unruly thoughts, the noise of desperation to make a career, and the necessity to have a constant income  they stayed with me. I truly reached an impasse on life, and it was all darkness. I needed light.


It happened in the middle of the night. I opened my eyes to a white nothingness. I couldnt see a thing. It was blindingly bright, but it was familiar. Whichever side I turned my sight to it was only infinite luminance. The light. It came back for me. I couldnt move. I just stood there in front of it, inside it, becoming one with it. After some time, I was disappearing into the light; or maybe it felt like all that light was disappearing into me, but I didnt know for sure. I slowly felt the falling, quietly, drifting down, towards something. And I opened my eyes to the bright rays of morning sun spreading on the walls of my room. 

That day, I decided to start my own business and never look for a job again. 




 from *Walking* by Thoreau 




 That's very encouraging. Thank you :) 




  It's not wasted work, it's practice.

This is one great piece of advice. Nailed it.

 Experience a story every day. You'll magically feel motivated to write again.

I recently started writing Flash-Fiction to get better at writing fiction. This is how I'm trying to feel everyday, experiencing a new story!

Thanks.. All the very best for the great future ahead :) 




 INTERSTELLAR sure energized me to become better at my art: **Writing!** 




 Great that your book is out... Good Luck, pal :) 




 Hey thanks a lot... Am downloading the documentary already.. Will surely watch.. I like docus very much :) 




 I like the flash fiction pieces that emphasize more on *single-scene* settings rather than long *short-stories*. It gives more chance to take the reader into a part of the story, like waking up to a moment into the dream.. You never remember all of the dream, only few vague portions of it. [Flash Fiction, according to me should be like that, or at least *that's my style*.]

Your work is good. The descriptions were easy enough to paint a good visual picture to the reader. Keep it at that level, it's good. Now, on the other side of the things, the writing from the point where a gun was pointed at the back of his head to the moment the stranger entered the last digit into the safe.. things didn't seem much clear. It felt like what you wanted to say wasn't properly delivered. In short, that part was unclear. 

Over all.. Good work 7/10.

 All the best for the next one :) 




 Awesome and outstanding :D 




 Awesome design....  




 Wow.. thank you so much for mentioning this... You just gave me new books to read in my life... :) :) 




 Nice post... Deep down, little emotional... Geographically, at least! 




 Yes. Please. 




 Yeah there is something there.. What's that?? 




 Kindle Paperwhite, of course! 




 *Under The Dome* being more than 800 pages did put me away from picking it up till now, but someday I will read it, which is why I never watched the TV Series past S01E01. But then Stephen King is like that only. Master Artists don't mind the length when they're really keen on their work. But then hey this is a misconception. In Harry Potter series multiple books are way more than 400 pages, but they're a part of my life and may be I would've been disappointed if they were written any shorter. 




 One of the best film posters of all time. A really awe inspiring one. 




 I guess the look on Amelia's face at the closing shot self-explains that she didn't have a clue of all the Good that happened to the Mankind because of their mission. She should've known. But may be that's why our hero started his journey to her, probably to tell her how important she was in her contribution to the saving of Mankind.  




 I like to believe it to be true. May be there is a Parallel Universe where you're right and you exist in another Universe, and are sending back dreams to your other self in other universe, who is wondering about it all. I love this shit! 




 Did Buddha put his tongue out in this pic....?? I remember a picture of Einstein doing the same. By the way, awesome drawing, pal. Keep it up :) 




  the premise of the story is good, but the dialogue just didn't seem natural.

Yes.. when I re-read it on and on I'm feeling this too. That's where I think I need to concentrate from now on. Any suggestions are most welcome :)

 you were translating from Indian to English

I really wasn't trying to do that, I was writing in direct English. But knowing that this is how it sounds to reader made me feel real awkward about my writing. But thanks for coming up with this point, because I believe this is a very vital aspect for a non-native English fiction writer, which I completely am.

 The last part, while a really good idea, isn't executed quite right. I found it really hard to believe that somebody would throw keys that close to another person (even if they don't like her) and that she would have time to stand up, hear someone say "MYTHYA, WAIT, DONT STAND! (by the way, caps made it seem like the person was screaming at the top of his lungs which would take even more time), and then throw her hands up to cover her face. I don't think her reaction to that warning would be to cover herself. 

Special thanks for pointing out the occurrence errors.. will keep that in mind next time.

 I think it might be better if Praveen said: "Mythya, look out!" as that would signal that there is some sort of danger coming at her.

Now, that is very straight and simple (why didn't I do that before!) 

Thank you for the entire response which is going to influence me in the direction of good writing :) :) 

And I would like to ask you if you know of any resources that would help me in bettering my *dialogue.* 


 




 Hey PrpleWlf, thank you so very much for the extra effort. Your suggestions are very supportive. The way you pointed out the difference between usage of languages depending on region is very new and helpful. And coming to my nativity thing, although I'm from India, my life's aim is to become a very good English language novelist. I've great stories to tell, but the kind of fiction-writing skill that I possess puts me far away from it. I will take up the journey and travel far to reach it. 

And special thanks for re-writing the first paragraph in your way, this would help me think better the next time when I rework on it. Although getting a translator is a good idea, I want to put up the necessary skill into myself to become good at writing fiction. Courses would be a good idea.. thank you for mentioning that :) :)

 Truly hoping this is of some great help, and not to demoralizing;

Your response is in no way demoralizing. It is truly some great help.
Thank you so much :)
 




 Thank you so very much for the critique :)

I have to say that it was very difficult as an English reader to get through simply due to the grammatical issues

Can you please point out where I went wrong?? Honestly, I believed that my English is good, but looking at what you just said, I now feel the fire to learn where in my grammar that I should improve.. Thank you so much for that. 

 While the ideas behind the story are good, the grammar takes away from it.

Yes. This is a real trouble.. Please shoot at me whatever suggestions you have in this aspect. 

 Do not take this to mean you should give up in writing,

I can never do that. Never!

 I would not expect myself to be able to write in your own native tongue without first learning the language

You just opened my eyes to the fact that I do not know English as good enough as a writer should know. (I mean, I speak good English everyday with people all around me. Even now, I'm talking to you fine, I believe, with no grammatical errors.)

Thank you once again for the very uplifting review.. If you can, just help me with the above mentioned issues as well. Thanks :) :) 




 I realized Flash Fiction to be very helpful for polishing your writing abilities. This one here is my first flash fiction. It might even probably suck. But I don't mind. I'm here to listen to you guys and improve my fiction-writing skill, or rather build it up. I don't know. Please just critique this piece as much as you can. I want only to get better, that's my sole purpose. (I'm from India, so English is not my native language, but suggest me there as well.) Thank you all very much :)







It was 10.15 AM on a Monday morning, and peoples minds were just migrating from a weekend induced relaxation to the work environment again, getting their psyche ready for the next five days of hustle bustle in their daily lives.



Mythya was seated at her desk with her hands loudly and busily typing a mail to her manager about the tasks for the week ahead. She does that every Monday. She looked at the clock, and pictured how the next 5 days were going to be. *Occupied as always with nothing unusual ever to happen in my life,* she thought. 



Karthik sits opposite to Mythya, four desks ahead. Distracted by the typing noise, turned his head to see who it was that sounds involved in work so seriously already, and found that most of his team mates were not even seated at their desks. Hey who is disturbing the blissful morning silence with the noise of work? asked Karthik.



Praveen and Vinod were standing few rows away from Mythya. Praveen was stretching his body, getting ready to go and get a bite of something in the cafeteria. Beside him Vinod was holding the key ring of his shelf and playing with it in his hands.



Its her, said Praveen lazily, pointing to Mythya, she must be sending her work schedule for the week. 



Yes, guys, responded Mythya, just typing the usual weekly mail. We all got to do this.



Yeah, right, but not already, said Karthik. Its Moday morning, for Gods sake, kill some time. 



She looked at him and chuckled.



Praveen stared at Mythya for a moment and something came up in his mind. Karthik, talking of work, I guess I left some important papers at your desk last Friday. 



Yeah, you did. I locked them up in Vinods shelf, said Karthik pointing to the desk next to him. 



Vinod felt attentive at the mention of his name. Oh yes, sorry, I forgot to mention that, he said to Praveen, still playing with the key ring.




Karthik, please do me a favour, started Praveen. Im going for breakfast, meanwhile please take out those papers and keep them at your desk. Ill come back and collect. 



Sure. Just get me the keys of the shelf. 



Yeah, right. Please hand him your keys, he said turning to Vinod.



Here, catch, called out Vinod, and raised his fist to throw the key. 



At the exact same instant Mythya started to rise from her desk. Praveen observed this. MYTHYA, WAIT, DONT STAND! he said, loudly.



By then the key ring had left Vinods hand and was shooting towards Mythyas head which abruptly appeared in its trajectory.



Listening to her name in a loud caution, Mythya reflexively raised her both hands in defense, covering her face and head.



As she did this, the key that was about to hit her had stopped in front of her hands, but it did not fall down  *it started to float in the mid-air.*


 




 Yes... Miss this guy :( 




 Please suggest me how to practice Informatica PowerCenter Tool. There are a lot of practice exercises on the internet but I don't have any repositories. Is there a way where I can build my own repository or download some free ones?

Please point out any other ways to build expertise in PowerCenter tool. Also include, if you can, info about certifications and their corresponding study resources. 

Thanks a ton. 




 Thank you so much! 




 "It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities." - Albus Dumbledore, *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*

This sentence has stayed with me, and will stay so till my last breath. 




 It's an awesome book.... In some way, it is better than the movie... You will know what I mean when you read the last page of the book. You will see the difference yourself. 




 Once again, I love this kind of posts! 




 No, I'm not! 




 That's sad to hear :( 




 Good one :)  




  Wait a minute, Reddit has some originality?

I meant the ideas that people come up with. They can be original, of course. Imagine J.K. Rowling coming here years ago and asking how it would be if she builds a world where they teach magic to kids as a field of academics.. I guess, Harry Potter wouldn't have been as big a phenomenon as it is today if somebody had stolen her idea and made a movie on it even before she wrote the first book! 




 There are some subs here such as [r/Writing](http://www.reddit.com/r/writing) or [r/WorldBuilding](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding) where people put forward new ideas they have for some of their future ventures, like writing a book, for example.

So, looking at those posts I often wonder what if somebody copies your idea and comes up with similar venture without giving you your credit? 

*How can we rely on the safety of the original ideas that we share on Reddit??* 




 The one thing that felt interesting to me in the entire film was that she disappears after reaching the infinite potential (the 100%) just like the car did in the example she demonstrates to the professors. 

So, at the end I saw it as Lucy *becoming one with the Time,* and thus turning herself infinite and forever, which I think explains her last words: *"I AM EVERYWHERE"*  - just like Time. Time is everywhere. 




 This is my first flash fiction reading I guess.. and I would now say what practicing the *show don't tell* type of writing means! Thanks.. I'm gonna Save this post and come back to it for reference to help my own writing practice. Great work, pal :) 




 She was very hot as CatWoman!! :D 




 Please remove this post if you like the scene so much... With this camera quality video you're dirtying the people's food called Interstellar. 




 Ok.. as promised, I just listended to both tracks, and they didn't sound similar in any manner... to my ears!  




 :D :D :D :D :D  




 listening to both of them rightaway.. will get back to you on this. 




 Yeah... True.

*I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.* -Maya Angelou 




 Awesome man.. thank you so much.. I literally Googled for this kind of pic of Endurance.. And here it is today... Credit goes to you ofcourse.. thanks a lott :) :) 




 Thanks for the answer. 




 Thanks for the question. 




 That's a nice idea...!!  




 Thank you for pointing that out for me :) :) 




 Thank you so very much for the resources.. :) 




 Thanks for poiting it out.. I too am going to read his answers for other questions.. May be I can learn a lot.. 




 Thank you very much for the answers.. and by the comment that *showurnust* posted I got to know that you answered various other questions in this sub.. so I just befriended you here so that I can read all the possible explanation given by you for other questions.. Thank you so much for the good work.. 




 Yeah you're right... I was thinking like a 3D being ;) 




 thank you very much for the answers.. :) 




 Thank you so much for the answers.. I appreciate it very much :) :) Thanks a lott, especailly for quoting Kip Thorne. 




 Yeah you're right. Because just now, I came back from watching the film for the third time. I posted that on Twitter and some person tweeted me saying "what a waste of 9 hours!" 

I mean, what the hell, how can someone say such a thing about INTERSTELLAR. 




  Typical third dimension beings.

Yeah *Muggles*
 




  It's beautiful, utterly beautiful.

Yes. Nothing less! 




 1.	When the crew left Earth, they reach *Endurance* in just a matter of minutes. Is *Endurance* placed so near to Earth?

2.	How did Brand know that they are dealing with the beings  (they) of five dimensions?

3.	Why did Romily die? What caused the explosion? And why was Dr.Mann trying to kill Cooper?

4.	How come NASA manufactured a Space craft that can travel into the higher dimensions without even knowing what those dimensions hold?

5.	In the 5th dimension scene (where Cooper is hanging around the bookshelf) he gives the S.T.A.Y message to Murph first. Later on, he gives her the coordinates for NASA in Binary. But those things happened the other way, no? First they stumbled upon NASA secret location and later when he was about to leave his Earth, Murph gets the S.T.A.Y message.

6.	And why did he even send the S.T.A.Y message at all? If Murph wouldve convinced him showing that message, they would have never saved the Mankind, so why did he even send the S.T.A.Y message in the first place?

7.	The data was coded into the seconds hand in the watch when Murph (young) placed the watch on the bookshelf after picking it from the floor. But only years after that day Murph (grown up) comes back to pick it, and then sees the seconds hand moving. So, has Cooper been waiting there behind the bookshelf in 5th dimension all that time for her to grow up and come for the watch? 

8.	How did Murph (grown up) suddenly realize that it was Cooper that has been her ghost all along?

9.	Tesseract gets closed and Cooper was pushed outside of the worm whole and was later on found by other Rangers. So, by the time he came out of the wormhole back into our galaxy, has his data been utilized and the whole plan A thing worked already? Because he looks to be of the same age when he wakes up in hospital on Cooper Station, and two weeks later Murph turns up as a very old woman (of some 80 plus years, but when she shouts Eureka she was may be just 35 plus.. so what has Cooper been doing all those 45 years and where did he end up all that time).

10.	 Well thats it from my side, but there are a couple of more minor doubts from my roommate: How did Cooper exist in two places at once? And how did they manage to move the entire population of Earth to another world?

Thank you, guys :) 




 Awesome analogy there.. the comic book thing.. Do you have Youtube videos of webpages for us where we can watch/read the actual explanation by Grant Morrison?? 




 I'm jealous of your nephew. I guess now he would even build up an ambition of becoming an Astronaut! Good for him :) 




  Having the urge to watch the movie again

I just came back from watching the movie for the third time :D 




 That's encouraging!! Thanks 









 ya whatever, man! 




 Happy Children's Day :D 




 In the wake of INTERSTELLAR film, I would like to ask you guys about the books (not Sci-Fi ones) that deal with higher dimensions, alternate/parellel universes, time warp concepts and etc.

Please suggest.
 




 thank you for this... although I guess it should say "more than just a MAN"..  but I guess this version is more unisex... nice.. anyways, this is a motivating piece.. thanks for sharing it here.. 




 Darkly funny! 




 Hey hey hey.. Isn't this form House of Cards :D 




 I've always loved this quote! 




 Fuck.. I just saw my face in this.. This sentence is a fuckin' mirror.  




 Oh didn't knew this... thanks.. 




 Yeah exactly, that's what I meant, they didn't come up with all that themselves.. They took help of a scientist (physicist, to be precise), so I too wanna learn stuff in the same way by taking help of books.. Because I can't afford hiring scientists to teach me stuff.. Hence, this post! 




 I up vote you for just your try... Good luck for the reading habit..  




 Can you please tell me what according to you is hard sci fi? 




 you SHOULD go watch INTERSTELLAR..  




 you SHOULD go watch INTERSTELLAR..  




 Ya.. I recently read this book and was spellbound by the way it was architectured!  




 good work!! 




 After watching INTERSTELLAR, my heart cried in ecstasy!

And, also I've never before seen audiences clap out of respect once the end credits started to roll.. [This is from India.] 




 Thank you so much, man! 




 Why?? Does science not involve the way we live... And isn't family a part of, a very important part of, the way we live on this planet?? 




 Thank you so much for the post! 




 I don't know why people thought it to be a lame quote.. It has a great depth in it, I shall try to give view point of how I saw that quote: 

The evil that arose from *strength* and *power*, when such an evil is prevailing in the world, but if none is to stand up and act against it, if everyone is thinking *weak* and *cowardly* of themselves, such a resistance to act would create more evil because it is fueling it.

In a nutshell, just imagine what would be the plight of Gotham city if Bruce Wayne would've been afraid to become *Batman* and fight it. 




 Hahaha... Correct!! 




 Outstanding! 




 "You call it hope, that fire of fire,
It is but agony of desire." - Edgar Allan Poe

Not that I'm negating the actual post, but looking at your comment I just thought I might as well mention this candid line by Poe. 




 Nice full-form of HOPE.. :) 




 Well thought, pal! 




 Awesome quote.. I'm surprised it only 2 comments till now.. 




 That's pretty much nails it all.. Thank you so much :) :) 




 Hey thank you all so much, guys.. Very helpful suggestions there... I will surely put them to good use :) :) 




 I was thinking such a thing recently.. Thanks for the push :) 




   it's pretty obvious that inhaling exhaust gases is bad for you.

Yeah.. That's what I meant. 




 seriously true and good... 




 haha.. you might laugh so hard that this post can be NSFW..  




  In the midst of winter, I found there was, within me, an invincible summer.

I have always loved this quote. It speaks so much in this one candid sentence! 




 I commute by Autorickshaws.. 

when a diesel truck or bus passes me, that weird diesel exhaust smell really bugs me.

Yes, this is the trouble... and also one more thing that really irritates the fuck out of me during such rides is the noise of the horns from all those vehicles who want me to get the fuck out of their way. (*I mean, come on, I'm trying to do good to the planet by opting for a cycle, give me some damn place to ride it.*) I had to move sideways and sideways until there is no place left for me to move anywhere. I hated all this experience, this totally removed the joy out of riding a bicycle, for me. 




 I recently bought a Firefox Roadrunner Pro-V.. I decided to commute to office daily on that bike, the distance is 9KM. But only after a week's ride to the office, I felt discouraged, especailly because of the overwhelming amount of traffic I had to face. I'm from India, *the second most highly populated country on the planet.* So, that's kinda seems obvious. 

I work in corporate, and by morning 8AM onwards the traffic sky-rockets in corporate cities (I'm from Pune). InitiallyI tried riding in that traffic, but I observed that every motor vehicle's smoke is comes out onto the commuters who take longer to travel, which is me, in this case, as I had to ride very close to them all. We don't have sepearate roads for bikers in my country. 

So, I felt bad about the kind of traffic I had to ride through. I decided that this is actually bad for my health, inhaling all the pollution from the vehicles all along those 9 kilometers. 

But everyday when I come back to my flat and look at my bicycle in the parking place collecting dust, I feel really bad. This is something I'm unable to turn around in my life.

I would really like to hear about your cycling habits, so that may be I can adopt some of them and make my bike and feet feel worthy. 




 Hey thank you so much... also for the link... Next time when I pick up *Paradise Lost* I shall use this resource!! Thank you so much :) 




 Hey thank you so much for the feedback.. It is very helpful and surely didn't hurt a bit, because my main focus, as far as my "Writing" life is concerned, is not on poetry, it's basically on *fiction.* This poetry pieces are just a trail to drench my thirst, just to see if I can writing nice sounding and rhyming stuff. That's all. Apparently, I couldn't.

Anyways, talking of poetry, let me confess, I tried reading epic poetry like *Paradise Lost*, but truth be told, I never *understand* anything in those epic poetic lines, but then sometimes among them I used to find some really awesome powerful *quotes* kind-of lines, which made me keep going if only for searching more of such lines.. 

Why I'm telling you all this is because you really seem to have great knowledge on poetry related works (you even mentioned that your academics are related to this field). So I want to ask you for help. 

Please help me with an explanation on how to read epic poetry?? I mean, I literally Googled for a verse/prose translation of Paradise Lost. *How freaking weird is that* - to search for the English prose translation for a work already originally written in English itself! I mean, come on, what kind of idiot does such a thing.. I did it. Because I was unable to figure out even a single sentence clearly.. 

Now, tell me what am I supposed to do about all this?? I really want to read great epic poetry, like Paradise Lost, Divine Comedy, The Aeneid, Beowulf and etc..!! HELP.

**Note**: English is not my first language, I'm from India.

 *The Brief History of Time* by Stephen Hawking - fits your specs of scientific non-fiction.. That being said, there are great books in non-ficiton domain. Try exploring books that are outside the apparent science genre because when you look keenly, everything has science at its heart. 

Books by :

* Malcolm Gladwell, Nassim Nicholas Taleb (fall under Social Science)
* Michael Lewis, Tim Harford  ( fall under Financial Science)

are very insightful.

And then:

* Isaac Asimov (if you ever find any non-ficiton book by this person, devour it without second thought, he's that good.)
* try reading biographies of remarkable people.. I loved Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson
* Walden by Henry David Thoreau   Into The Wild by Jon Krakauer
* A must read novel: *Flatland* by Edwin A. Abbot
* The Flipside by Adam J. Jackson

These are some of my recommendations for now, just to make you get used to reading interesting stuff.. and once you do that you will automatically start finding books on your own! 




  don't take Chinese proverbs literally. Same goes for any language proverbs.

True. Proverbs, in their deepest sense, are merely brilliant metaphors. 




  no, it seems OP did not make it up

:) You're right.. I did not. 




 Harry Potter's magical world! 




 I experience this whenever I stay away from reading for more than a couple of days. Something seems missing in my daily life when I do that. And this quote seemed very appropriate for this sub where *reading* is a part of our lives... So I just thought we should see this.

EDIT: This post made some people feel like we are looking down upon non-readers.. No. We are not.. And this quote doesn't share even the least bit of such intentions. *Reading is about knowledge, but it is no real knowledge if it doesn't tell you how to treat people that are different from you in ways that you feel are vital for a person's ethos.* I offer my apologies to all those who felt hurt by a few number of comments that some people (may be even me) posted here. We sincerely don't mean to hurt anybody ever in the matters of book reading.. **May be we kid sometimes, here and there, but we are all a brotherhood here!** 

Thanks, everyone :) 




 I guess you took this quote right out of Austin Kleon's blog... Worthy quote, though! 




 IN 2014:

* I STARTED MY JOB CAREER. MOVED TO A FAVOURITE CITY OF MINE, PUNE, INDIA.
* I TOOK UP [R/NOFAP](http://www.reddit.com/r/nofap) CHALLENGE ON REDDIT FOR 131 DAYS IN A ROW WITHOUT A SINGLE REPALSE.
* I [FINISHED READING 25 BOOKS](http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/2qoi2p/im_24_now_i_was_free_much_of_2013_and_id_read_36/).
* I GAINED AWESOME FRIENDS AT MY COMPANY DURING THE TRAINING PERIOD.
* I'M A BLOGGER. I WROTE GOOD STUFF THIS YEAR.
* IN NOVEMBER, I TOOK UP A WRITING CHALLENGE FOR MYSELF AND WROTE MORETHAN 13 THOUSAND WORDS IN 21 DAYS. (EVERYDAY HAS A MINIMUM OF 500 WORDS IN ITS NAME FOR 21 DAYS AT A STRETCH.. I'M A NON-NATIVE IN ENGLISH.. LIKE I MENTIONED BEFORE, I'M FROM INDIA..)
* WITH THE PUSH THAT WRITING CHALLENGE HAD GIVEN ME, I STARTED WRITING FLASH-FICITON FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE IN ORDER TO IMPROVE MY FICTION WRITING SKILL. (I WANT TO BECOME AN ENGLISH LANGUAGE NOVELIST!)
* DECIDED NOT TO TAKE UP ANY, SO CALLED, 'NEW YEAR RESOLUTIONS' FOR 2015.


BUT THAT'S ALL IN THE PAST.... NOW IT IS ANOTHER YEAR, MOTHERFUCKERS. SO LET'S GOD DAMN BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE **NOW** PART.
 




  MAJOR FUCKING NATIONAL EXAM NEXT YEAR

I WISH YOU ALL THE VERY BEST WITH ALL MY HEART FOR YOUR EXAM THIS YEAR.  




   UNSTOPPABLE MAGMA-BLOODED RHINO

THAT IS JUST FUCKING WELL PUT. 




 Awesome post, pal.. Thanks for posting... It's very inspiring....  especially the below line:

 It is time to take that pain, that agony and use it to build from here.

I've my things lined up for this year, which actually started in December 2014, and that was a very apt line for me to remember. Thanks :) 




 The Wiki link is obvious... but I'm more interested in personal opinions and experiences of people here.. Thank you though :) 




 Nah :) 




 awesome... if you do any such ones plz do post the links here in the comments.. because I'm saving this post already :) 









 Hey, high five.. Same problem with me as well.. I suck at writing dialogue. And I was already skinned alive on r/destructivereaders for that. 




 Haha :) :) That would serve a great purpose indeed :) 




 Yeah.. Simple as that.. 

Read. Stop. Repeat. 




 ok.. after moving to Pune in March of 2014, I had been to a book sale where they were selling books by weight.. 1 KG for (just) Rs.100/-

I bought 23 books for (just) Rs.570/-

That's the best buy, not just of 2014, but of my life till date :) 




 Honestly, my best buy of the year relating to books is the Rs. 1100/- broadband internet connection.. *(If you know what I mean!)* 




 I've always had this doubt since I read *Gitanjali* by Rabindranath Tagore, him being the first author I read that was awarded Nobel in Literature.. and then I went on to read Ernest Hemingway's *Old Man And The Sea* and John Steinbeck's *Of Mice And Men*... 

I loved *Gitanjali*, liked *Of Mice and Men* and disliked *Old Man and the Sea*.. 

I thought it's time I clarify to myself about how Nobels are awarded in Literature category. So, here I am asking about it. Please shed some light. Thanks :) 




 I can't suggest you any books but I am surely taking some titles out of your list as suggestions for me.. Thanks :) 




 Hey very informative reply, pal....  




 And I just love this thread :) 




  The Alchemist. No matter how meandering the path, the journey is worth it.

This book is a part of my life..  




 Although I like your determination and all, it's a serious way to turn reading as a chore than as a pleasing hobby.. Reading is a blessing, and don't count your blessings word by word, pal, counting them by books and their respective pages is enough already.. But that's just me :) 




  there's so much to be read! 

Yes.. there's so much to be read.... It's like a Universe in itself.. There is always very much more to know of :) 




 Oh.. roger that :) 




  One per week. 

Awesome.. All the very best and Happy New Year :) 




 This isn't even a bit about Hindu mystic bullshit.. or for that matter any religious bullshit... It's solely about my own mystic mind's bullshit. Simple as that, buddy :) 




 Sorry, although I've a Masters in Computer Applications, I don't like the idea of algorithms telling me what to read next. I would like to leave that duty to the destiny.

But thanks for sharing the link here, there are people who prefer to believe in digitized life than in a destined one.. they would love the link, I guess. So, here is my upvote for the post :) 




 The main thing that drove me and still drives me towards reading more books is *I'm an aspiring writer*.. and to write better you gotta read better and read like hell... So once I tried to take up writing seriously, and as they say *when you pick up one end of the stick you pick up the other end too..*, I had to take reading seriously as well... and that lead me through myriad portals toward the kind of stuff I'm interested to read/write about.. and I kept picking up books.. 

So, that's the most important thing about forming my reading habit.. and also another vital aspect is I was gifted a *Kindle Paperwhite* by my brother-in-law for my birthday around July 2013, and thence my reading habit got redefined :)

And coming to the part of feeling reading as a *chore*: I've a weakness in my mind.. that is when I start reading a book and if I don't feel interested in it or if it felt tough or anything, I simply cannot give up reading it.. I feel defeated by that book when I do that.. I somehow continue it till I end it.. So during such times, yes, reading feels like a chore... In the list I mention in the post, the books that especaily felt like that were: *The Loser* by Peter Ustinov and *Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde by R. L. Stevenson* (I'm trying to fight this weakness, which would help me save time and makes reading not to feel like a chore, at times..)

Rest all were fine, but I obviously didn't like all the books equally... 

So, that's about it :)

Thank you so much for the interest you showed in asking me about my habit forming.. 




 Roger that.. Thank you for the correction.. Will remember when I use it next time :) 




 I was just like you till a couple of years ago... Maybe you too would pick up the reading habit soon.. Good Luck.. Happy New Year :) 




 good resolution.. 




 I'm thinking to name 2015 as *my year of short-stories*.. I'm an aspiring writer, and I recently started to write flash fiction to practice my fiction writing abilities.. So, I'm thinking to read lots of short stories in 2015.. atleast 100 short stories. 




 I got recruited from my campus (NIT Kurukshetra, India) in the March of 2013 itself while I was in the final semester of my Masters.. but the joning date didn't turn up till the March of 2014.. meanwhile I picked up reading books all along that waiting period.. and also a bit freelance writing.. I'm a blogger, too. 




 yeah I love non-fiction.. especially the ones that talk about technology, economics, science, and ofcourse biographies... among the list the non-ficition books I read this year are *Next* by Micheal Lewis, *The Accidental Billionaires* by Ben Mezrich, *The Undercover Economist* by Tim Harford, *The Tipping Point* by Malcolm Gladwell, *Tuesdays with Morrie* by Mitch Albom... I loved each of them.. and among biographies, last year I read and **loved** *Into The Wild* and *Walden* (although not a bio) and another technology book about Big Data.. and I also started *Steve Jobs* by Walter Isaacson but did not finish it as I didn't carry the book with me later... But i loved whatever I read from it.

 The non-fiction book that I'm currently reading is *Representative Men* by Ralph Waldo Emerson.. and I plan to pick up *The Information* by James Gleick in 2015 :)

Non-fiction is almost always awesome :) 




 Finally, finished the book... and also took help of *Sparknotes* to understand it better... Thanks, guys :) 




 Thank you :) 




 Thanks :) 




 I know they're not great numbers compared to what people here usaually hold.. But still, I did fine for where I came from..  I'm a non-native in English, (from India), so I slowly picked up the habit of reading books, and now they're an integral part of my life. Books mean a lot to me. My dream is to become an English language novelist. So, I look forward to develop my reading habits and abilities to a great extent in the future.

The list of the 25 books that I've finished in 2014 are:

* *The Great Gatsby* by F. Scott Fitzgerald 
* *The Man Who Japed* by Philip K Dick  
* *The Accidental Billionaires* by Ben Mezrich 
* *Tuesdays with Morrie* by Mitch Albom 
* *Siddhartha* by Herman Hesse 
* *The Doomsday Conspiracy* by Sidney Sheldon 
* *The Illusions* by Richard Bach 
* *The Flipside* by Adam J Jackson
* *Animal Farm* by George Orwell
* *Saving Faith* by David Baldacci 
* *The Loser* by Peter Ustinov 
* *The Undercover Economist* by Tim Harford 
* *The Tipping Point* by Malcolm Gladwell 
* *Screw It, Lets Do It* by Richard Branson 
* *Flatland* by Edwin A. Abbott 
* *1984* by George Orwell 
* *Prey* by Michael Crichton 
* *The Giver* by Lois Lowry 
* *Out of My Head* ( also published as *Unknown*) by Didier Van Cauwelaert 
* *Next* by Michael Lewis 
* *Gone Girl* by Gillian Flynn 
* *The Old Man And The Sea* by Ernest Hemingway
* *The Rubiyat* by Omar Khayyam 
* *Of Mice And Men* by John Steinbeck 
* *Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde* by R. L. Stevenson 

 and also an essay called *Walking* by Henry David Thoreau

Thank you r/books, for being such an awesome sub and for putting lots and lots of new books into my life.. You guys rock :) 




 The fuck bro.. It's awesome :D.. Thank you so much..
I was fucking surprised there are no comments on this post yet.... That's very mean :(

Especially the awesomest thing is that the videoscreen has the name of the track playing... Fuckin perfection, pal :)) 




 Dude, come on.. that was Mark Twain... not from Michel-whatever-his-name-was! 




 This is SOMETHING! 




 awesome 




 Hey, it's not Ghandi.. It's Gandhi.. Sorry, pal, we Indians take this seriously.. 




 I absolutely loved them though.. I was asking this only out of curiosity :) 




 BATMAN. 




 Here is the track that I was talking about from Predestination film.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=599vpKbNEek

This is such an intriguing track.. I would like to know more of such tracks. 
Please help.. Thanks :) 




  Jon Krakauer
 
 Malcom Gladwell

*Into The Wild* by Jon Krakauer is a part of my life now.. and so is *Outliers* by Mr. Gladwell.. awesome non-ficiton writers both of them... 




 Malcolm Gladwell and Michael Lewis. 




 *On Photography* by Susan Sontag 




 The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho, of course.. But I think you must've already read it.. Sorry, if so. 




 Ok.. thanks for encouraging, pal.. I will continue it :) 




 HEy, thanks for the list... :) 




 I thought that it is such a small book and a classic, too, so I felt happy to pick it up, but, boy, I was so very wrong.. The book is literally unreadable for me :( 

(I'm not native English.. )

Is it only me or is there anybody else out there who felt similar difficulty?? 

Robert L. Stevenson, why would you do something like that, sir?? I loved your *Treasure Island!* It was such a nice read.. 




 Great and true advice :) Thanks for reminding us to do what is necessary. 




 * Opening paragraph was well engaging. 
* Second paragraph was tough to read and sounded very confusing.
* Third slowly seemed to be losing direction.

Ok, now I better probably stop pointing out para wise.. All paragraphs can and should be improved for easy readability and visualization. 

Now, there are for sure very good lines from the letter:

 What are words, but dancers upon a page? 

Awesome opening line.

 the way you stabbed them with your tongue.

Very well put sentence.

 And this letter will never meet your lips.

I didn't get if the narrator was expecting the letter to be kissed (*meet the lips?*) or just be read (done by lips as well). If you meant 'to be read' this line can be better put as: *And this letter will never flow through your lips.*  or better: *And this letter will never flow through your lips and into your heart.*

And one more thing about my critique.. If my words hurt your feelings, don't take me seriously... Keep up the good work and do awesome writing as always.

[As you mentioned that you wrote this piece over a year ago, and as it is usually said that you need a good amount of time between you *write* something and you come back to edit or *re-work* on it... I guess you just didn't look into it after that year's time, and directly posted here without reworking upon it. It's visible, the *first-draftness* in the writing] 




 Awesome Christmas Tree :D :D 




 I liked Bradbury's *Fahrenheit 451*.. What an idea it holds!! Amazing concept. By the way, what's the name of the short story collection of his that you're reading? 




 Can yo please share with me what you loved about *The Old Man and The Sea*?? Why am asking is I'm new to reading classic books, and I didn't enjoy this book much.. So I want to know what made people love it, so that I can read such books with that mindset next time when I pick up some. 




  The Old Man and the Sea
 
 The Great Gatsby

I've read these both... They felt ok... Good ones.. Gatsby book was way better than the other, though. 




 First of all, I was expecting great story from the book because of all the hype of it being a classic and all.... and most importantly due to the depressive environment the entire book had bestowed upon me (I must say, in this case the author succeeded in making me feel the Dystopian time completely.. Orwell did great work at that)... So, I guess, I disliked the book mostly because I was expecting lot of great thrilling story from it rather than focusing on the classic idea of privacy invasion.. so that's the reason. My bad. 




  Nobody aint denied nothing

Oh that just tripled.. LOL :P 




 Herman Hesse is good too.. His Siddhartha was very intriguing.. Thanks, shall try Steppenwolf as well. 




 Steinbeck is no doubt great.. In just over a 100 page novel he came up with such an engaging story of people.. I like this kind of small books that tell a lot.. I loved *Animal Farm* as well.. Suggest me some more small books that tell a lot, if you know of any. 




 I love *Animal Farm* but I dislike *1984*.. Sorry, can't help :( 




 The first edition of *Five Point Someone* by Chetan Bhagat. The inner page of the book cover has Chetan Bhagat's coolest picture on it. I love books with their Authors' full page picture in them.  




 Thoreau is great! Both in life and in text. 




 I'm from India, and I'll probably be downvoted to hell for asking this question:  *Why do Americans use a lot of double negatives?* Isn't that a wrong usage of the language? So, why would an English speaking country use it so much??


 




 I'm ridiculous at the things that I love... Can't help.. ;) 




 And you're talking as if it's a sin to do so! 




 Hey, 2014.. I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for giving us this film. We will reminisce this experience all our lives. We will engrave *2014* in our hearts with golden letters, and probably sprikle some *star-dust* on it, too!

This year will remain a truly life changing period to many people, like myself, who saw *Interstellar* as more than just a film.

Thank you so much, 2014, for giving us such a cherishable conclusion for the year.  




  but serving in a greater sense.

Sure he is..
 




 What does the quote actually mean? 




 This was a very weird concept - comparing a person to a movie and the situations in it... but interesting as well... A new perspective :) 




 Hmm.. may be I will :) 




 No.. I like italics, that is all.. and why should italicised words mean disgust? Why did you think so? 




 In case you haven't gone through the below post today on r/writing, please do.. It's a great motivation for writing!

http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/2q0air/what_are_some_sentences_you_wish_you_wrote/ 




 Second of all, your post is going to give ideas and inspiration for many nbewbies like myself.. thanks again for that, mate :) 




 "Anything with the power to make you laugh over thirty years later isnt a waste of time. I think something like that is very close to immortality."

That's another Stephen King right there... from *Hearts In Atlantis* 




 You just suggested me a new book!  




 Hey, OP.. First of all let me thank you for coming up with such an awesome post.. Really refreshing and requiring for aspiring writers.. 




 That's one outstanding line. Now, I wish I wrote that! 




 I've never read Joyce. Was he referring to *semen,* in that sentence?  




 The first work I've read of Stephen King's is *Hearts In Atlantis* which is a collection of three novellas.. and I loved the storytelling in it.. Bobby's character as a young school kid in *Men In Yellow Coats* novella is written very well. I could almost relate him to me when I was a young kid myself.  




 Thanks, OP, for this post! 




 Why, indeed?  




 It wasn't pleasant to read... Too many neithers and nors, especially... And also a bit of hi-fi vocab here and there... Should've been easier, I guess.  




 fuckin' awesome! 




 This post also belongs in [r/Interstellar](http://www.reddit.com/r/interstellar/) I request you to please post it there as well. 
It's necessary.  




 This sounds like it is about *The Interview* film ban! 




 Awesome advancement...!!!  




 Do you realize that you just gave me a new idea for a book, or may be a short story. Thank you so much :) 




 May be we give it away by finding it out... 




 Anyways, in this scenario Interstellar helped me stop being a creep then. But still, isn't writing poetry artistic and not creepy??  




 A Gripping Glitch...  




 true that! 




 Ok. I will keep that in my mind.. But here in India, things work differently.. Anyways, I wrote that poetic piece not because I just wanted to give it to her, but solely because as an artist, a writer, I couldn't hold back the explosion of feelings in my heart whenever I looked at her or thought about her. 




 Creepy?? Since when is expressing your love for a girl in poetic form creepy? I thought it is artistic. 




 Acc to me, The Lost Symbol is the least impressive RL adventure. The recent one, Inferno, is way better than TLS. But *Angels and Demons* is his best ever work. 




 Dan Brown - Robert Langdon novels. 




 (This is all from India) A couple of months ago I started liking a girl in my office.. She is a very beautiful girl.

 I'm a writer by hobby, and the beauty of that girl made me pen some lines about her. I wrote a poetic piece, titled as [Her](https://medium.com/@krishna_mydream/her-c95a39117644) and I gave it to her. I don't know if she even read it or not. I tried a few times to talk to her in person after showing her that poetry, but she straight away refused so talk to me. 

This whole incident had toubled me for weeks, my mind was occupied by her thoughts.. and then one fine day, November 8th, I watched the most awaited movie, *Interstellar* - and that's it.. The chains of that girl's beauty that had imprisoned my mind all along this time could not hold me back any longer, and they freed me.

 The grandeur of the cosmic tale told in the film had made my mind to wash away many trivial troubling things of my life, among which is my liking towards that girl. 

I'm an aspiring writer. After witnessing the mind bending brilliance of Interstellar, I realized that I had better things to do in my life than to sit back and feel bad for a rejection. 

Interstellar really expanded the horizons for my exploration of stories. Now, standing in front of the enigmatic journeys into the tales of wonders of the Unvierse I can voyage into, worrying about a girl seem merely unworthy of my mind's thought process.

Thank you so much for all this, *Interstellar* :) 




 First, simply put *Walden* is called an *American* classic because it is a classic work written by an american (I'm an Indian, by the way). 

And second, it is definitely a classic book, no questions asked. In *Walden* Thoreau's insights about where the Mankind is going in the matters of human character and environmental love, the two things that are put into each of us from the moment we take birth, are nothing less than astounding. There are many instances in the book that are capable of making us feel embarrased for the way we're living on this planet, without worrying least bit about this eternal(?) home of ours. If there is one book that should be seen with no boundaries of country, it would surely be this. Hence, please don't call *Walden* a specific *country's* classic, rather call it a Mankind's classsic, which it is undoubtedly is. 




 *Eldorado* by Edgar Allan Poe  




 Hey thank you so much for the share :) :) 









 Yeah now i'm interested in Gillian Flynn... I will surely read her other books but I don't read same author multiple times in short spans of time, so I will wait...  




 I'm from India and the movie is not present here anymore.. so I'll just wait for the DVD/Bluray to come out.. You just saw the film, so I would suggest you to wait a while and then read it... because I guess one would not be able to read a book properly under the influence of its film, so try waiting till it wears off.. but that's just my thinking though ;) 




 I don't generally read this kind of fiction.. I'm usually into Thrillers, Sci-Fi, Non-Fiction.. But after knowing that the movie by David Fincher has done so well I thought of picking up the book before watching the film adaptation of it.. and it was an amazing experince over all.. The most interesting part about the book is that both male (Nick) and female (Amy) narrations are great.. The thing that most intrigued me is how well Amy character turned out as the story moved forward.. It evolved very powerfully. I loved it. 

 A 4/5 book for me in the recent days... Awesome :) :) 




 My thoguts exactly... I was spellbound realizing that perfection and be this perfect! 




 Thank you so much for the interest.. It's a simple breathing pattern/technique. But I'm afraid I won't be able to articulate the process and benefits of Sudharshana Kriya as much as the *The Art Of Living Foudation* does, the institution where I learned it from.. So, [here is the link](http://www.artofliving.org/in-en/what-sudarshan-kriya) to where you can get a glimpse of what the Kriya process is all about.. Whatever is explained in there, believe it or not, it sure did change my thought process a couple of years ago, and I'm a person who stronly believes that your thoughts make your life, hence I can happily say that it did bring a great change in my life. (And you can also find many videos of the Kriya process on the internet, in case if you wanna try learning it.)

Good Luck and Namaste :) 




 Brilliant piece :) :) Thanks for sharing.... 




 I loved the science and behind it and also Man's conflict with Nature.. especially the Chaos Theory part.. I absolutely love this book :) :) 




 thank you so much for reading it, pal... and special thanks if you decide to share it with others.. i'll be very thankful :) :) 




 interesting... good luck for whatever comes your way :)
I too just did a blog on what interstellar means to me, and posted [here](https://medium.com/@krishna_mydream/pursuing-your-passion-can-be-an-interstellar-journey-e61b49187aa9).. it's more of the uplifting blog types.. but your experience is a better and new one.. try giving it a read.. Thanks :) 









 Hey thanks for the info and the comment.. :) :) 




 Good that you posted it here.. Can somebody please explain the sentence in detail?? 




 Interesting! 





























 SINCE A COUPLE OF DAYS I HAVEN'T BEEN DOING MY FUCKING BEST IN LIFE. EACH NIGHT WHEN I SLEEP THERE IS A VACUUM INSIDE MY DISSATISFIED HEART SOMEWHERE. IT GIVES ME THE FEELING OF VAGUE REGRET. IT'S A WARNING SIGN THAT SAYS THERE IS SOMETHING FUCKING WRONG WITH HOW I'M INVESTING TIME IN LIFE.

I KNOW I WILL BOUNCE BACK. BUT I DON'T FUCKING LIKE TO KEEP BOUNCING BETWEEN GOOD AND BAD FEELINGS SO GODDAMN FREQUENTLY. I DON'T WANT TO BE LIKE THE PRICE OF A STOCK ON THE SHAREMARKET.. I WANT TO BE FUCKING CONSISTENT IN MY PLANS AND LIVING. 

CONSISTENCY IS FUCKING NECESSARY TO ME FOR WHAT I TOOK UP TO ACHIEVE IN MY LIFE RIGHT NOW. BUT I'M FUCKING TIRED OF TRYING TO BOUNCE BACK EVERY TIME I FEEL LIKE THIS.

THIS QUOTE IS APT FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME RIGHT NOW:

**"IF YOU'RE TIRED OF STARTING OVER, STOP GIVING UP."**  




 trending on the front page of Reddit.. that's what you're doing with your life... Pretty awesome if you ask me! 




 No. Harry is the only survivor on whom the killing curse is *performed*.. so technically Voldemort can't be called as a survivor as he wasn't *performed* the curse upon, and moreover he wasn't a survivor at all... He disappeared at that moment.. and was almost dead... so no he did not survive.. he yielded to its effect. 









 Oh my god.. such a great advice... thank you so much! 




 when something cool like this quote comes up, the nonsense and the so called "funny" comments really ruin the fun out of it....  




 this pic is visually very fascinating.. 




 MEDIOCRITY IS THE BIGGEST MOTHERFUCKING WORD I FACED IN MY ENTIRE LIFE THAT HAS PUT ME WHERE I AM TODAY. BUT I SEE THE SILVER LINING IN ALL OF IT. THANK YOU, MEDIOCRITY. CHALLENGE ACCEPTED. 














 GREETINGS FROM INDIA.. ALL THE VERY DAMN BEST FOR THE GREAT AWESOMENESS AHEAD, BROTHER! 

NAMASTE :) 




 THIS YEAR I TOOK UP THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE OF MY LIFE. SOMETHING THAT HAS TO DO WITH HIGHER EDUCATION.. A NATIONAL LEVEL ENTRANCE EXAM AT WHICH I WANT TO DO VERY WELL, LIKE REALLY VERY WELL, LIKE FUCKING AWESOMELY WELL... 

I AM TRYING TO STRICTLY WORK TOWARDS IT. TODAY I TRIED TO STRATEGISE MY PREPERATION FOR THIS MONTH. (AND ALSO I HAVE A DAY JOB SO I GOT TO MAKE TIME TO STUDY EVERYDAY AFTER THE WORKING HOURS..) IT'S 2AM IN MY COUNTRY'S TIMEZONE NOW. I'VE BEEN STUDYING ALL ALONG SINCE 10.30PM. AND I'M GOING TO STUDY SOME MORE NOW.. THIS EXAM IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME.. (I NEED TO STICK TO THIS TYPE OF HARD WORK FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR AND MORE.. LET'S SEE!) 



 




 Thanks for the translated post. It's amazing.. What is the title of the book in English? 




 YEAH.. HOW WE USE OUR TIME CAN BE A REAL BIG DEAL IN LIFE. BY THE WAY, IF YOU CAN, COME AROUND SOMEDAY AND SHARE SOME OF THE COOL SHIT YOU'RE DOING IN YOUR LIFE.. WOULD SURELY HELP OTHERS IN GETTING IDEAS! 

GOOD LUCK 




 YES I DID... BUT TIME AND AGAIN COMING BACK HERE TO HELP OTHERS BY TELLING WHAT GOOD STUFF YOU'RE DOING IN YOUR LIFE WOULD BE OF A KICK FOR ALL. I'M NOT ASKING YOU WASTE TIME ON THE INTERNET, BUT JUST ASKING TO KEEP THIS MOTIVATING SUB OF OURS ALIVE.. IF YOU THINK THAT IS A TIME WASTE, THEN YES PLEASE GO AHEAD WITH WHATEVER YOU'RE DOING IN REAL LIFE WITHOUT WASTING TIME ON THE INTERNET. 

NO HARD FEELINGS, BROTHER!

ALL THE GODDAMN BEST FOR WHATEVER YOU'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE IN YOUR LIFE :) 




 I did not understand this quote! 




 AWESOME FEAT BROTHER. LET ME TELL YOU.. YOU DID GREAT, MOTIVATING THE FUCK OUT OF YOURSELF BUT WHAT CAUGHT MY ATTENTION WAS THE 4TH DAY. WHEN YOU STEPPED OUT INTO THE OPEN FIELD AND STARTED TO BACKFLIP WITHOUT THAT SOFT BED TO BACK YOU, I REMEMBERED THE DIALOGUE FROM *THE DARK KNIGHT RISES* : **"DO IT LIKE THE CHILD DID. WITHOUT THE ROPE"**

AND YOU DID IT, LIKE BATMAN.

CHEERS, BROTHER! 




 LIKE I FUCKING MENTIONED ALREADY IN THE TITLE THIS SUB IS A REAL GODDAMN NERVE TREMBLING GROUND. THE WORLD OUT THERE THINKS WE ARE LOSERS. WITH ALL THE MIGHT IN OUR MINDS WE DO KNOW THAT IT'S NOT ANY BIT TRUE. BUT THIS SUB SEEMS LIKE IT IS PERFORMING VERY MEDIOCRE. NO POSTS FOR DAYS AT A STRETCH. I FUCKING DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA WHY IT IS SO. 

**ARE WE FUCKING AFRAID TO SHARE WHAT THE HELL IS HAPPENING IN OUR GODDAMN LIVES?**

**ARE WE FUCKING SHY TO RISE FROM THE AHSES AND BE THE PHOENIXES THAT WE ARE?**

WHAT THE HELL IS STOPPING US FROM COMING AND CONNECTING WITH THE LOVELY BROTHERHOOD AND SHARE SOME FUCKING MOTIVATION?

OK... ENOUGH RANT.. NOW, BORROWING THE WORDS FROM GANDHI, I WOULD RATHER BE THE CHANGE I WANT TO SEE IN THE GODDAMN WORLD AROUND ME. SO I'M GOING TO MAKE POSTS HERE REGULARLY. 

I DON'T KNOW IF ANY BUTTHOLE OUT THERE IS LISTENING TO THIS BUT I REALLY WANT US TO BE GODDAMN WINNERS IN OUR CHOSEN ASPECTS OF LIFE, WHATEVER THE FUCK THEY MAY BE. AND I DON'T WANT THIS SUB TO BE A STAGNANT FUCKING POND, RATHER I WANT IT TO BE THE BLOOD IN OUR BODIES, ALWAYS FLOWING AND KEEPING US FUCKING ALIVE.

**ALIVE, MOTHERFUCKERS. DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO BE ALIVE ON THE INTERNET?**

THEN FUCKING PROVE IT!

 




 SOMETIMES IN LIFE FOR THE FUCK'S SAKE YOU GOT TO DO THE THINGS SOLELY FOR YOURSELF. YOU GOT TO FEED YOUR FUCKING SOUL WITH SOMETHING EXTREMELY DELICIOUS, WITH SOMETHING THAT IT CRAVES FOR SEVERELY. IF YOU EVER GO THROUGH SUCH A TIME, DO REMEMBER TO STOP THE FUCK AND REFLECT ON THAT JEWEL OF A MOMENT, BECAUSE IT HOLDS THE MOTHERFUCKING KEY TO THE MOTHERFUCKING DOOR WHICH OPENS UP TO SOMETHING THAT IS BUILT PURELY FOR YOU ALONE IN THIS ENTIRE UNIVERSE. I MEAN, ASK YOURSELF HOW FUCKING SAD WOULD IT BE TO GODDAMN MISS SEEING SOMETHING LIKE THAT! 




 That's a nice idea... but I'm so keenly attached towards the actual last name, *Dumbledore.*

He is an epitome of all the things from the Harry Potter series that defined my life.
 




 YES. A GODDAMN YES FOR THIS POST. 
WE ARE ALL GONNA MOTIVATE THE FUCK OUT OF EACHOTHER. NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT. LET'S JUST FUCKING ACHIEVE SOMETHING IN OUR LIVES ONCE AND FOR ALL. 

*AIMING FOR SOMETHING THAT IS SEEMINGLY UNATTAINABLE AND YET CONFIDENTLY WORKING TO ACHIEVE IT WITH ALL THE PASSION AND MIGHT HIDDEN INSIDE THE NERVES OF YOUR INSANELY BEAUTIFUL MIND IS WHAT I CALL THE FUCKING PURPOSE OF A GODDAMN HUMAN LIFE.* **SO LET'S DO THIS!** 




  I'm starting to think that real life is my pseudonym

That sounds like a very well put opening sentence right there, pal :) 




 Oh.. that's a big bad news for me :-(

Let's say I want to use *Dumbledore* as my surname.. Then what? Should I be asking J.K. Rowling for permission?? (*I wish the answer is 'No'*) 




 And also let me please ask you one more doubt of mine regarding pennames:

 *Is it ok to adopt a part of my favourite fictional character's name into my penname? Or should I be approved by character's creator (author) for doing that?* 




 Is this a digital image?? Which software was it created it?? I just would like to recommend it to my animator/3D modeler friend. 




 I logged in to upvote this post. 




 Ok.. Sounds cool and legit. Thanks :) 




 Yeah.. That really makes sense. Thanks. 




  one reason is to restart a career

Thanks for the information.. Didn't knew this before.  




 The idea of your book is really interesting to me... Especailly the prot realizing that he doesn't know anything.. Greetings for coming up with something like that .. And all the very best for it get good publishers.. and when it happens do plz message me a link where I can buy it.. Amazon probably.. I'm from India. I would like to read your book, pal, assuming that it's not very very long ;-) 

Thanks :) 




 Great idea.. and it's most of the times true in my case as well. Music has myriad times influenced my mood to write.. It moved me so much that I once immediately started to write a poetic piece, which I felt as my best work yet. (It's a heartfelt message to my girlfriend while I was in college.)

Most of the times it is film sound tracks.. Hans Zimmer, especially.. I'm from India, so I would like to more names to it: A.R.Rahman, Shankar-Eshaan-Loy, Amit Trivedi etc.. These people's music had influenced my thought process many times and pushed me towards writing something refreshing, which I didn't have in mind moment prior to listening to their music..

However, I don't everytime get influenced by music alone in order to put my thoughts to words. No body should, because it will make you feel dependant on it. That's not how creativity shold work always. 




 What if I want to write books with another name but tell out that it's actually me? Is that against the accepted norms in the Writing arena?

Just asking. 




  The same thing happened when I read "The old man and the sea" :/

Greetings, pal. I too felt *The Old Man* by Hemingway to be so boring. Thank God it was very small, so I was able to finish it off, just for the heck of it.. 

 




 Yeah.. I'm into Part II of the book and got really put off all along.... 




 Thanks for the precaution.. shall never touch it. 




 Thanks... but I don't like Hunger Games either.... I hated the concept shown in the film... 




 Let me ask: what kind of an idiot helps a person who he met only days ago, and assists him in killing a person, or rather commit the murder himself?? I mean, there was nothing where he questions Raymond what is the real matter behind all those Arabs following him and why is he carrying a revolver. He always agrees for whatever Raymond asks for, not just about partying out, but also in hurting and killing somebody. What is existentialism? Is it straight ahead killing somebody whom you think is trying to harm you? Why did nobody, neither the protagonist nor Raymond, ever tried to speak it out with the Arabs before using the weapon, guys?? What kind of *ism* is that?? 




 I just realized from comments here that the book is about *nothingness* in particular - and unfortunately I don't like nothingness - the only nothingness I ever liked is the vacuum in the cosmos. 




  not a bug, a feature.

I like the way you put it :) 




 I'm 24 and not at all in high school right now.. and also am from India. 




 Right now I'm thinking to stop reading *The Stranger* by Albert Camus...
 




 I have been trying to read one book per week this year.. so this week i picked up *The Stranger* by Albert Camus, looking at its classic status, and also because it is a small book (I like small books). I've enterted into the Part II of the book just now, and all along Part I the book seemed to be having no soul or story - it just went on and on randomly to here and there - with characters that came up having no good depth.. and also the narration is pretty dull. I guess this is the book in a long time that I read half without finding a single quote to highlight.  




 never heard of it... will surely check it out.. thank you so much..  




 I DECIDED TO WORK LIKE HELL FOR THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE OF MY LIFE, A CHALLENGE THAT I TOOK UP AT THIS POINT IN MY LIFE, BUT I HAD BEEN AN ASSHOLE (ALTHOUGH NOT COMPLETELY, BROTHERS) AND DIDN'T PUT GOOD POTENTIAL INTO IT YET. THIS ENRAGED ME.. BUT NEVERTHELESS IN THIS MONTH I LOOKED AT THE PITFALLS IN MY PATH. AND LET ME CONFIDENTALY TELL YOU ALL BUTTHEADS THIS: *I AM NOW BETTER SHEILDED AGAINST THOSE PITFALLS, GODDAMNIT. I WILL FUCKING USE THEM AGAINST THE STORM AND WILL SWIM FORWARD, UPSTREAM. I WILL WORK LIKE FUCK I'VE NEVER SEEN IN MYSELF BEFORE. I WILL FUCKING SURPRISE MYSELF WITH MY POTENTIAL* 

AND LET ME ALSO TELL YOU THIS, MOTHERFUCKERS -  I LIKE THIS SUB VERY GODDAMN MUCH - BUT AT TIMES IT IS VERY PUTTING OFF TO COME HERE AND FINDING OUT THAT THE MOST RECENT POST WAS DAYS FUCKING OLD.. 

**OLD WON'T DO, LET'S ALL BE NEW..**

**EVERY FUCKIN DAY, IN EVERY FUCKIN WAY..**

*[THAT'S FROM THE POET IN ME, WHICH IS WHY THE HELL IT EVEN RHYMED.. ]* 




 YES. THOSE ARE SOME REALLY GODDAMN GOOD WORDS. THANKS, FRIEND! 




 I'll just be candid. I'm trying to develop an idea that I felt interested in for writing my first novel. I can say that the idea I'm taking up deals with the existence of parallel universes.. Can somebody please suggest me some good books that will help me know about Parallel Worlds and Universes?? 

Fiction or Non-Fiction, or even poetry, whatever works you think would be helpful for me, please suggest them.

Thank you all so much :) 




 This AMA has some really good questions and answers for artists, and people looking towards passions and dreams... That itself made me click the Save button and upvote this post. 




 Thanks for giving me a new goal in life.... I will collect all those books for myself.. and yeah by the way, I'm gonna share this pic on my Hogwarts group on Facebook. I shall link this URL there in order to credit you. Thank you so much, pal :D 




 I can not just pass by any *Thoreau* related posts without upvoting/commenting it..  




 meh.. 




 Yes.. possibly.... 




 did not understand... it sounded gramatically wrong as well... 




 awesome pal... very motivating one! 




 Hey, OP, plz tell - is this quote from a book or something??  What's the source?? 




 no doubt.. 




 Oh it is.... especially the last five words 

 we travel between the eternities. 




 Source plz... the writer of this quote deserves it... 




 Yeah.. why not.. Positive thinking/attitude has proven multiple times that it can make great changes in the world.. and in people's lives.. Although telekinesis would directly mean moving things physically, optimistic mindset also appears to do the same with the situations of life - it physically changes the circumstances of a person's life and makes him get what he desired. For example, **placebo effect**- the way people think and perceive a situation literally makes changes in the same. 









 I will never give out spoilers for anything.. I hate ruining any kind of experiences of people.. That being said, I felt The Giver as just ok because I don't enjoy dystopian novels very much.. They just feel very depressing. I'm not good with the books that give out such feeling.. I even disliked *1984* by George Orwell especially for this reason, while I loved his *Animal Farm*.

Talking particularly about *The Giver* the narration seemed a bit different and most of the times very straight not bothering about exploring the feelings of characters in depth, although it helped in keeping the book short, which I like. 

So, you might completely enjoy the book if you're fine with dystopian concepts - it's a good book for those who enjoy such setting. 

 




 Very cogently put! 




  Finished Book #1 yesterday and just finished this book (#2) today.

I always wonder why people here remind me again and again that I read so fuckin' slowly :(== 




 Steve Jobs book is awesome.... and hey thanks for reminding me to read *Business Adventures* 




 It felt just ok for me... 




   i suspect it will consume the next 1-2 weeks of my life atleast,

800 plus pages and you finish it in just a couple of weeks?? amazing!!

TIL again that I read dead slow.. Thanks for reminding me that! 




 **Zen Mind Beginner's Mind, by Shunryu Suzuki** - an introduciton and a peep into the practices of Zen Buddhism.

Finished reading:

* **Steppenwolf, by Herman Hesse** - an intriguing story of a lone person who comes to experience mulitple facets of his life by meeting a few persons in a new city that he moved into.

* **Carrie, by Stephen King**  - the debut novel of the outstanding author.. nuff said. 




 Your art work is very very awe-inspiring... You will reach great heights in life :-)

Thank you so much for sharing it here... 




 Hey really thanks man for those words....!!! 




 Helpful.. Thanks... The book is really tricky ;-) 




 This is really awesome.... Thanks :-) 




  HE KNOW WHO HE IS.

HE FUCKIN KNOWS WHO HE IS - 'KNOWS' - NOT 'KNOW' - USE THE GODDAMN GRAMMAR FUCKIN CORRECTLY YOU GOOD FRIEND OF A BIRTHDAY BOY.  




 Your response is helpful.. Thanks :-) 




 Bodh Gaya, India - said to be the place where Gautama Buddha attained enlightenment! 




 I'm reading Shunryu Suzuki's *Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind.* In Part 2 of the book I encountered this paragraph:

*Practice should be directed from achievement to non-achievement. Usually when you do something, you want to achieve something, you attach to some result. From achievement to non-achievement means to be rid of the unneccesary and bad results of effort. If you do something in the spirit of non-achivement, there is a good quality in it. So just to do something without any particular effort is enough.*

But, let's say I'm preparing for a National level entrance exam that would put me into a great college for higher education. So, I will surely be attached towards a result - to get into the top college in the country. But that paragraph speaks against it.

Am I looking at it the wrong way? What would be the actual interpretation of that paragraph in this scenario?
 




 Thanks a lot, pal, for giving the source.... 




 How enriching...!! 




 Nailed it. 




 Nice language usage.. and good point too... 




 I often wonder how much time people waste by talking shit in Reddit comments.. and how much more by reading them. Would be good if somebody comes up with such an analytical post on r/InternetIsBeautiful or somewhere!! 




 It's often surprising how, while great minds like Newton, Einstein and etc., that discovered the science of the universe as we know it, are naturally humble to the inexplicable mysteries of the world around them, some of our so called *modern scientists* all boast up as if science can explain anything and everything, as if nothing in this world is a wonder or a miracle, as if everything can be put to scientific explanation. 




 THIS.IS.SOME.KICK-ASS.STUFF. 




 What you said is seems true... I just saw a comment here for my post from a person and he really misinterpreted it. 




  Translation: It doesn't matter which way you go, if you don't have a direction in mind

I'm sorry to put it like this but I'm 100% positive that this is not it.. Your translation speaks of negativity of mind and thought.. But the point in the book where the paragraph came up is not in least bit relevant to what you said. Anyways, thank you for the response. 




 From Part 1:

*A Zen master once said, "To go eastward one mile is to go westward one mile." This is vital freedom. We should acquire this kind of perfect freedom.*

I didn't understand the metaphor. Can somebody please guide me through it?? 




 But it's 600 pages (short books?? :O ) ah.. I don't normally consider such a pagecount as short by any means. Thanks anyways, pal :) :) 




 Hey, thank you so much for the suggestion.. I picked up Steppenwolf.. the first book i finished in 2015.. it was very good.. in a way i liked it than Siddhartha.. Thanks a lot :)

Do you know of any other books that have such internal voice that speak of life like Steppenwolf did?? If so, plz tell me.. 




 12th January (i.e, today) is Swami Vivekananda's birth anniversary and this day is observed as *National Youth Day* in my country, India. He's one of the greatest souls ever lived on this planet, and his teachings are a vibrant inspiration for many. 




 I would be interested in the word count of Stephen King.. he sure seems like a writing machine to me... with at least two books quietly coming out each year.... He's *something*! 




 I logged in so that I can upvote this quote.. 




 Because that's what's on your goddamn mind, pal! 




 This one sentence is the entirety of **Zen**! 




 Yeah.. Mr. Twain is that great! 




 the video is blocked at my work-place... will check it out once i reach my room. Thanks a lot..  




 If you're going into the places with lot of natural touch, then I recommend the essay [*Nature*](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/29433/29433-h/29433-h.htm) by Ralph Waldo Emerson. Read it and you will not look at the nature with the same perspective as before. 




 Yes I'd already read *Nature* by Emerson.. It was splendid, too. I've never before read something so beautiful about Nature. Very heart warming and soul enriching :)

 




 this photograph deserves more... you should serisouly post this on r/pics.. it will explode :) 




 this is my all-time favourite of Thoreau's quotes. 




  going it alone can be tough

and can also be blissful.. trust me.. the kind of solitude you will experience while travelling and visiting places alone, in a way, such solitude can not be attained even by meditation. It is such. It can be enlightnening, but for that you need to retrsopect into your life and talk to your conscience.. Take some books with you that talk about nature and world around you, even such poetry would do.. Go, explore the solitary travels. Good Luck :)  




 In a way, this quote had helped be take up solo travelling in 2014.. 
*Henry David Thoreau* is my guru in some of the aspects of my life. 




 Indian here.. I have this doubt from a very long time: *Why is Justin Bieber trolled and hated so much in the internet world??* (I know I'm going to be downvoted just for asking this but I needed to ask.) 




 Oh yes.. Definitely. Thank you so much :) 




 Today I was listening to some podcast where the panel members mentioned that in the recent days there are many, many new planets that are being continuously discovered and that most of them are just gas planets. Listening to that I got this doubt: 

*Considering the Big Bang theory, wasn't our Earth too a gas planet at its infancy, which later cooled down and developed into a full fledged life-supporting home? So, if those new planets are now designated as gas planets, doesn't that give way to the possibility of them turning into life suppoorting planets later on in the unvierse's eventual timeline, just like Earth did??* 




 Why in the world am I downvoted for thanking!!!! 




 Yeah that's a good idea.. In my country (India) a recent best selling book series called: *Shiva Trilogy* by Amish Tripati had a smiliar experience. The first book in the series was rejected by nearly 20 publishers.. and so he made a trailer of the book's concept and released it on Youtube.. and also released the first chapter. People liked and the buzz grew around it.. and eventually publishing companies came to him and published his book. Now, his trilogy is a massively famous book series in India. And I even heard that for his next book, which he hasn't even written, a publishing house already bought the rights in advance with a price of around 5 crore rupees.. 

So, yes just try putting a part of it infront of the people and see what happens. 




 I don't understand why publishers/editors reject a book even after thinking it's a good one. How can they decide that a book won't be liked by people when they didn't even publish it? I think they're the most judgemental people on the planet. Really sorry for your situation. But I'm sure something WILL turn up and your book WILL be published.. It's all about the time. Let it take the time it is asking for.. You will surely be rewarded worthily. I will give you an example.. 

*When I was doing masters, almost 80% of my class got recreuited from campus but among the other 20% was one of my best friends in the class.. he tried like all of us but he couldn't get through all that year. Eventaully when the college was over, he left without a job in hand unlike most of his classmates.. He needed a job desperately. He persevered another year, and on Dec 24th, 2013 he was recruited as a Banker by the biggest private bank in India. (Yeah, this is all from India). And his salary is higher than the average salary of the entire batch. Well, he waited and persevered, and he got better than what most people did.*

I believe in such things.. and now in your case also something makes me feel the same way. You will rise! 




  you are totally a reading elitist

I don't know if you ever heard of Chetan Bhagat.. He is India's best selling author.. and also the most criticized.. Well, I'm a great fan of him... Now, me being his fan, in my country if I say I'm an elitist, the actual elite people will beat me to hell. Believe me. If you don't, then google the criticism for Chetan Bhagat.. 

I'm not an elitist. Life is more enjoyable when you have a reading habit.. and having that habit I feel my life is better in terms of interestingness than a non-readers life. That's just my feeling, not an elitist way of looking at the world. If you still feel that way, then I'm sorry, pal. Keep hating me :) 




  [when Frodo left Middle Earth, never to return](/spoiler)

Hey, spoiler alert bro... People exist here, those who didn't yet read LOTR trilogy.. I'm myself one of them. 




 Thanks for the recommendation...  




  so you feel less guilty about being a smug brick

TIL that I'm a smug brick. Thanks :)

Apart from that, I said 'we' because a lot of our comments are misinterpreted. So, I just said that onbehalf of all those people.. But you are misinterpreting that too. How ironic! 




 Ok.. will pick it up.. Thanks. 




  I too would like to know what OP meant by "worthy". 

By that what I meant is that a person who is reading something that *he* feels is interesting to him has the right to feel the work is worthy of investing his own time and concentration, no matter what other people think about it.. For example, many people criticise Dan Brown and Malcom Gladwell, but both are my favourite Fiction and Non-Fiction authors respectively. I feel their books are worthy of my time and thought.. That is all what I meant.. 




 Happy that you found it interesting.. Thank you :) 




 I'm really sorry for my post made you feel that way.. the sole purpose of posting this quote here is.. i like quotes and i like books.. so this quote sounded like it really belongs here, just for people like me to read it.. and fortunately, for the first time in my Reddit life it worked and reached to many... That is all..  




 Roger that, captain.. Thanks for pointing it out.. Will really work on that..  




 Roger that, captain.. I removed the f-words from my comment. I like decent rules.. Thanks :) 




  A.J.Ayer would argue that pure religious talk is nonsense

It may be nonsense for him but surely not for the person that enjoys it.. Our enjoyment of knowledge intake should depend solely on our personal choices.. We have a goddamn right to do that irrespective of how A.J.Ayer or Wittgenstein or Hume or Plato or Socrates feel about it... Let's just use that right! (By the way, I like Plato and Socrates very much.. I just used their names as an example) 




  But that apparently means I'm not a reader. 

Why do you infer that? Who the hell told you that, pal? Reading can be of any form. As long as whatever you read gives you more knowledge about someting worthy, you're a *reader*. Let nobody tell you otherwise, more importantly, you don't tell yourself otherwise! 




 Good work, bro! Let me upvote you now :) 




 Oh, brother, you just inferred a lot of brilliant but unnecessary shit which the quote doesn't even seem to imply.. I'm sorry that it hurt your feelings.. What you said about those countries and cultures might be true, I don't know.. That quote doesn't even in the least bit tell anything about non-readers.. I just posted this quote solely because it appeals to book readers.. I would do the same even if that quote came from goddamn Bermuda Triangle! 




  I don't really appreciate when people discriminate or think they are above others based on their hobbies, and that includes people who think less of people for not reading novels...

Yes.. I'm not being serious when I say I look down upon them.. I know so many damn interesting people who don't read but are fucikn interesting at their minds... That being said, I belive guess the quote only refers to those people that have the habit of reading and how they, and only they, feel when they don't read for long time.. It says nothing about those who don't read.. it's just our own inferring. 




 Deep down, I too feel the same way about those who don't read. Sorry, can't help.. It's so fuckin great feeling. 




 Well, that nails it! 
























 [This](http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/a-dream-within-a-dream/) is where it came from. The full poem. 




 She always put that sentence on the letters that she wrote to him in his teenage and youth. 




  "They told me I could be anything when I grew up. And when I did, I became none of them."

I guess something like this one is from Chris Gardner, *The Pursuit of Happiness* : *There was a time in my life when I could become anything I wanted, and one by one I became none of them.*

Oh Shit.. this quote suits me so well right now.. 




 Harry Potter covers always rock!!! 




 Time Keeper is a really nice book.... and Tuesdays With Morrie is awesome.. 




 "All that you see or seem
Is but a dream within a dream." -Edgar Allan Poe 




 "I learned this, at least, by my experiment: that if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours." -Henry David Thoreau, Walden 




 I love this kind of posts.. thank you so much OP. 




 looks like i got a new book to read.. thanks 




 cool advice.. 




 Goddamnit Alan.. you're something. 




 it doesn't.. i was just kidding when I asked that...  




 I like your creative thinking! 




 you should leave out your magnifying glass!! although good correlation 




 and who said that?? 









 Also, can you please help me clarify a small doubt?? In [Desnity Plots](http://www.statmethods.net/graphs/density.html) what are *xfit* and *yfit*??

Sorry if my question seems stupid.. I'm pretty beginner at R and stats..
 




 It worked used read.csv("filename", sep=";")

str() now returns 17 variables. Thank you so much..
 




 I'm working on [this banking public dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing#) but when I imported the csv files into R and did a str() operation, it's saying that it has only one variable: 'age' while there are supposed to be other 19 attributes as mentioned in the website [link's *Attribute Information*.](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing#)

I need to make a presentation of Descriptive Statistics on this dataset and now I'm unable to figure out where the other 19 variables have gone.. Plz see if you too face the same problem. (If so then this is an error in the dataset itself, right??)


 




 FUCKING.NAILED.IT.PERIOD 




  I had 5,000 books (which I lost in a divorce)

How would anybody lose books in a divorce?? 




 *Walden* by Henry David Thoreau is my all time favourite book written by a non-writer. Thoreau is primarily an environmentalist who wrote out of passion for his work towards Nature than wih an actual drive to *write* something, the kind of drive that actual writers have.

What are your favourite books written by those who do not primarily *write books*? 









 sorta like the Zen stuff..cool. 




 He's just fucking with us... 




 Awesome collection... Thank you so much for the post!! 




 Roger that, captain :( 









 quote's awesome... but the background didn't suit... by the way, why the insect?? 




 I SEE WHAT YOU DID THERE IN THE COMMENT.... 




 YEAH THAT'S RIGHT.. OUR BROTHERHOOD SHOULD BE BIGGER. 




 YES.. THAT'S A GODDAMN GREAT WAY TO LOOK AT IT..  




 WELCOME TO THE PARTY, BROTHER. 




 Thanks to [Philip K Dick](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_K._Dick), the author of the film's short story... the same guy who wrote *Blade Runner* book and *Minority Report* short story as well. He's one of the biggest dudes in science fiction... 




  But I've never read a book in it's entirety.

I wonder what you have been writing all along without reading a single book... ( no offence, for every writer reading is the fuel that takes him/her ahead..) 




 says a lot... 




 * Fight Club
* Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
* Edge of Tomorrow
* Predestination
* [1 - Nenokkadine](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2375559/) (Telugu language)
* Unknown (Liam Neeson's)
* Inception
* The Truman Show
* Interstellar
* The Adjustment Bureau
* The Social Network (awesome screenplay)
* Doodlebug (short film by Chris Nolan)
* Following (Chris Nolan's first film)
* A Beautiful Mind
* The Butterfly Effect (Part 1)
* The Sixth Sense

and 

* Shutter Island

 




 *The Social Network* - the dialogues of the film always motivate me! They're so brilliantly written that I made a scene from it (*"Did I adequately answer your condescending question?"* scene) as my mobile ringtone!

*"It's raining."*

*"I'm sorry"*

*"It just started raining."*

I saw something illuminating in those lines and that's it my life was changed. 




 [*The Words*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1840417/) is a really fine movie about a struggling *writer*... I wonder why nobody mentioned it yet.. The moral crossroads that he reaches when he realizes that his truth is found out by that person left me with a haunting feel. 




 But in one of my experiences.. I had long time back browsed for movies *about* writing and picked up *Barton Fink* and *Adaptation* - and hated both. 




 *Inception* - never before watching this film did I take the concept of dreams seriously, but with this film, the horizons of human imagination have surely been extended for me. 
  

*Interstellar* - watching how the grandeur of the plot twist unfolds by the end of the film really made me think of creating such magnificent science fiction.. and that docking scene... OH GOD!! Fantastic.. 




 Hey awesome post!!! Thanks... 




  Others I might suggest are Into the Wild or The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. They're both more about escaping back to the wilderness, but both succeed really in motivating you to just go out and do something.

Yeah.. Second that! And also both have awesome OSTs.. they motivate me write.. and roam around in the out. 




 I fell in love with her in my teenage after watching Pans Labyrinth. 




 that's true...!! thanks for the response.. 









 From the titles you've mentioned above, I have already read *Into The Wild* and *Walden* - both had been powerful life changers... :) 




 *Into The Wild* has changed away my beliefs on individuality, passion, firmness in belief and all that stuff.. and then from this same book came another, one of the most vital books I ever read in my life, **Walden** by Henry David Thoreau - it showed an all new perspective of Nature, our place in it, and our arrogantly assumed ownership of the world...!! 

*Walden* is so fucking powerful that at some point it ceases to be a book and starts acting a missile inside your mind. 




 yeah, big deal.. Thanks for the name.. will check out what this book is about :) 




 *As a Man Thinketh* is one of the best jewels I ever picked up in my life... The content is pure soulful awesomeness.. 




 thank you so much for the detailed info... will pick this goddamn book for sure after listening about it so much from you guys :) 




 I love Sorkin's each and every dialogue from *The Social Network*! 
Especially, that *Did I adequately answer your condescending question?* scene... I've never seen such a scene before. 




 When it comes to non-fiction by Isaac Asimov, I prefer long works.. the longer the better.. I mean, it's like sitting and listening to one of the greatest minds of Mankind.. So, I dare not limit it to 200 pages! 




 Oh brother.... I adore Joseph Campbell's works... that PBS TV series **The Power of Myth** has opened me up to an all new perception of what is called a *mythology.* 




 Hey.. thanks a lot pal for taking the time to give such a response... helped me and others to know of more books.. thank you so much. 




 On the day I came to know that *Moneyball* is actually a book (I saw the movie first because the film version is written by Aaron Sorkin, my fav screenwriter), written by Michael Lewis, I immediately put it into my must-read list.  




 I need this! That being said, now you already know I'm thankful to you. 




 I read a similar nonfiction/selfhelp book last year.. *Flipside* by Adam J. Jackson.. Its about the hidden opportunities on the other side of the problems we face in life.. It has since then been in my 5 star book-list... I absolutely loved it.. it's a real life changer in a way.. 




  by Asimov

enough said... :D 




 I guess I need these... thanks a ton! 




 yaa.. i share a similar feeling about Freakonomics.. the other day I started the audio book and really couldn't feel interested in what is being read there... so.. i let it alone.. but Michael Lewis' *Next* was awesome.. 




 Loved his Animal Farm.. but 1984 not so much... let me see into this one...  Thank u so much for the response.. 




 this Einstein guy is really cool!! thanks.. 




 sounds interesting... thanks for putting it up.. 




 thanks a lot.. shall try picking it for sure... and also can you plz mention the name of the author.. there are many Hiroshima books out there.. so.. 




 liked the ending.... and I would like to believe in this quote, looking at how ambitions in my life are going right now. So, yeah I needed to hear this. Thanks to you and that friend of yours.. 




 Hello dear fellow Indian..this poster is kick-ass!!! Phaad diya bhai tune toh... (mera hindi itna acha nahi hai, so please don't mind) 




 I've seen non-fiction books being usually long.. But I love short non-fiction books too. Helps me absorb deep knowledge from short number of pages quickly.

My favourite short non-fiction works are:

*  *Words From The Myths* by Isaac Asimov (pagecount: around 130 pages - contains interesting Greek and Roman mythological tales behind the origin of some of the most used words in English language) (i love this book  more for the mythical stories it told than for its theme).
* *Nationalism* by Rabindranath Tagore (pagecount: around 100 pages - contains Tagore's views on what differs a Country from a Nation)

Do you have any favourite short non-fictional works? Would love to hear about them.. please share the titles and your experiences with them here.

Thanks. 




 this quote is very negative... unfortunately. 




 Grimm's Fairy Tales - Brothers Grimm 




 Special contribution award of sheer awesomeness goes to NettleStorm25 of Slytherin House!! 




 It should be so.. because there is something called as *improvement..* which every writer, rather every artist needs infront of him.. 









 That's a great thing really... you're way ahead of those people who are not doing as good as you.. All the best.. Do wonders with your stories. 




 awesome!!!! 




 Which ones did you buy?? Can you plz name them.. would like to know, just out of curiosity. 




 **The Martian** by Andy Weir 




 Well, this is the real dystopian. 




 Wow.. this post is fucking awesome... Thanks for coming up with this! 




 Siddhartha is truly very good.. and another one by Herman Hesse, Steppenwolf is awesome book... If you liked Siddhartha, then Steppenwolf is a must try. 




 *Walden* by Henry David Thoreau. This book depicts the beauty of world's nature and our position in it almost like no other literary work, may be except for the essay called *Nature* by Ralph Waldo Emerson, Thoreau's guru. 




 Hey thank you so much... 




 It's just a link to my blog.. anyways I removed the URL.. so I guess we're cool there! 




 It's a big relief that this isn't Harry... No glasses, see. 




 I like reading very much. It shaped my life.. Basically I love words and I also write.. Recently I started writing short pieces .. So to explore more of this ground, I'm looking for some books that are filled with short stuff.

Please suggest me books that have:

* Splendidnly well weaved words.. like some very short poetry.. something like Gitanjali.. (I have long poetry books already.. now I'm looking for something like one page long at max)
* Beautiful short musings
* Anything well written that's longer than quotes but shorter than stories, like a couple of pages..
* Short myths kind of stuff may be (short)


Sorry, I'm unable to articulate properly what I want, but I guess you get the idea... 

Please suggest lots and lots of works.. (actually I'm an aspiring writer.. So, I'm exploring the beauty of words to fill my mind with it. That being said, if possible, put a note called "extra-works" and suggest whatever other works you think would be helpful for me to chisel myself into a better weaver of words..) 

**Sorry if I'm asking too much of your time and effort with all this... but please help me. Thank you so much.** 




  In one way of the other we're all ugly. 

Please note that I said: **everybody** and also that *ugly hat* is a personification of our various character traits.. 

 




 Or maybe he's just teaching his son to respect other people's ugliness too; a character trait we all possess in this modern world. In one way of the other we're all ugly. 

I guess that hat is a personification of people's inner self and we all need to love one another despite our ugl.... OKAY!!! this is going nowhere.. I'll just shut up! 




 deep shit. no kidding 




 He's a true friend... One of the most memorable moments for me in the entire book series is in the 7th book when Ron leaves Harry and goes away from the forest.. and then after a period of time when he comes back.. 

*Ron says: "Dumbledore always knew I was going to leave you, that's why he gave me that Deluminator."*

*"No. He always knew you would want to come back," Harry corrects him.*

That is the most epic moment for me in the friendship of Harry and Ron. I was very very disappointed when this scene is completely left out in the film. 

 




 I guess you mentioned you work on web technologies.. Holding an academic degree in Literature, how/why did you land up in tech arena? Just asking! 




 oh a degree in literature... that's so cool.. thanks. will surely keep in touch.. 




 GREAT FUCKING THINGS ARE NEVER EASY. THEY SHOULD NOT BE. WHEN WAS THERE A GODDAMN EASY THING THAT YOU FELT BRAINFUCKING PROUD OF YOURSELF JUST BECAUSE YOU DID IT, A THING THAT NOT MANY OUT THERE HAVE DONE TOO? 

THERE WONT BE ANY. BECAUSE EASY THINGS ARE FUCKING DONE BY EVERY MOTHERFUCKER OUT THERE. SO WHAT SETS YOU APART FROM THAT HENPECKING CROWD? **DISCOMFORT.**

THAT'S RIGHT. DISCOMFORT IS SEEN BY MANY AS AN UNTOUCHABLE. NOBODY WANTS IT. DISFUCKINGCOMFORT IS AN OUTCAST.. BUT HEY THERE IS SOMETHING WE'RE PHENOMENALLY MISSING TO SEE HERE. DISCOMFORT IS LIKE THE DANGEROUS BRIDGE THAT CAN LAND YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE.. IN FRONT OF THAT CAVE OF TREASURE AND MAGIC THAT YOU'VE ALWAYS FUCKING DESIRED FOR. 

OFCOURSE THE PURPOSE IS NOT TO STAY ON THE BRIDGE ITSELF ALL OUR LIVES, BUT TO FUCKING REACH THE OTHER SIDE.. YOU SHOULD NOT LIVE IN DISCOMFORT FOREVER, BUT YOU GOTTA FUCKING USE IT TO MAKE THAT LEAP FORWARD IN YOUR GODDAMN LIFE.. 

AND THE PROPORTION OF DISCOMFORT THAT CAN REALLY TAKE YOU THE PLACE WHERE YOU WANT TO GO IN LIFE IS OF ASTRONOMICAL PROPORTIONS. YOU DO THAT ONLY THROUGH ADDICTION. GET BITCHLICKING ADDICTED TO DISCOMFORT - TO DO SOMETHING THAT YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE FUCKING DOING, THAT NOBODY FUCKING FEELS LIKE DOING.. 

THAT, MY BROTHERS, IS THE WAY TO GREAT THINGS... 

*WELL WOVEN PATHS CAN NEVER PROVIDE THE ADVENTURE LIKE FORESTS DO..*

**THINK ABOUT IT. DO THE DISCOMFORT.**



 




 I'm looking into different ways of storytelling... so ya that's about it.. mostly stories.. that's my art.. I'm not at all figure drawing guy. 




 Hi.. that mod reference to "there was another user who is a writer" was about me. I recently made [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/ArtBuddy/comments/2xw4y3/im_an_aspiring_writer_im_looking_for_a_buddy_to/) post regarding me wanting somebody to draw art for my writings.. So, I'm a writer guy.. a storyteller (just starting out on taking that up seriously, although as a hobby).

Your project sounds really cool and I would like to really try my hand at something like this.. (can't promise anything as this is absolutely new to me. Never worked on anything related to comics at all.. but want to give it a shot..) 

And also, I too prefer a leisurely pace, because I have a day job and commitments to lot of other creative stuff..
I'm from India, by the way! 




 Yeah like many comments said.. the idea is good.. but the execution of course matters... And also that human relations thing is true to its core.. I mean, look at **Interstellar** film.. it wouldn't have been what it is if the humanitarian aspects are not embellished into the plot.. look at that Docking Scene.. You want to save a planet full of people, and live for the your loved ones.. else you would just listen to the robot and not try anything, right! 




 Oh sure.. Please do. Not a problem :) 




 Hey, like I said your art work was fantastic.. so I felt like writing about it.. I just tried writing about that second picture of the Eye (image number #9 in the URL). So, this is like 'WriteBuddy' kind of stuff maybe.. [Here's the link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TBB-Leq0NlOdSx-UZgAI4Fz6NfOoZZxwX03xLmWAe38/edit?usp=sharing) to the text, please see.. (Sorry if it doesn't come anywhere near to what was on your mind when you created the artwork. That was just my interpretation anyway)

Thank you so much.. 

I would like to hear from you :) 




 Thank you very much for the response. I left you a message. Please check it out..   




 Oh thanks a lot, buddy.. Please do.. I will be immensely excited and happy to see my writings in drawing by somebody. Thank you so much. When you draw it and if there are any clear details that you would want to know regarding any of those writings, please let me know. I will give out a clear detail.. or you can please just give out your own interpretations.. anything is fine. Thanks once again! 




 I loved the film's [OSTs](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/secret-life-walter-mitty-music/id776155469)
But today when I was browsing through something another [OST album of the same film](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/secret-life-walter-mitty-original/id768262442) appeared. 

Now I'm pretty confused... Which one should be the correct one and why are there two OST albums for the same film?? 




 Hey a really big thanks for the kind of response you gave.. I will look through the suggestions and posts that you mentioned about... I really liked the idea of ArtBuddy and so I would try my best take help from people here. Fingers crossed!

Thanks :) 




 I mostly like writing fantastical or mind-bending related stuff, like Telepathy, Teleportation, Time Travel, Supernatural elements, Space, Cosmos and etc. I'm kindof starting out on them. Mostly short stories, short random writings and musings. You can take a look at some short stuff that I [wrote recently - ](https://medium.com/word-dust) especially the post titled ["On Looking at the Stars"](https://medium.com/word-dust/on-looking-at-the-stars-56ed4647d431)

I try to be imaginative in my writings and recently I felt like seeing my writings with illustrations, but I'm no good at drawing related activities. 

So, I'm looking for an ArtBuddy who can do that for me for fun (I can't pay any money, sorry about that.. I don't write to make money either, not yet)

**EDIT: (typo in the post title) "WHO can draw my writings"** 




 Deep! 




 Thank you :) 




 That's a pretty good advice.. Thanks a lot :) 
I will find such people who would stand as help for building up my skills. [If you're interested in doing so, plz PM me. It would be a great help, if not, that's ok too.]

Thank you so much for the valuable response and idea. 




 I'm 24, and I want to be a writer. So it is high time that I started practicing to write fiction. I want to do so through writing short stories first. But I'm looking for a good platform to present my stories to people. I'm using Medium for my blogging activities and sometimes Blogger. Blogger used to be my fav years ago, but recently it has turned to s**t.. really disappointed with that. And Medium is pretty good for articles and blogs, but for a long story kind of posts, I don't think it will suit.

So, I'm kind of looking for any suggestions on how to present my short stories to people. My interest is in writing fantasy (not like an epic fantasy, but mostly like Neil Gaiman, or Stephen King, with a touch of decent fantasy and supernatural elements) science-fiction, fairy tales and etc. 

Thanks for the responses in advance. 




 I would like to be friends with you. 




 Because it says things in its metaphysical sense that talks about fighting against the cataclysm that the Mankind was about to face, its doom, and not giving up in the face of it. 

**Do not go gentle into that goodnight** (*don't just give up all hope and die out, which is as easy as going into a good night sleep, only forever*)

**Rage rage, against the dying of the light** (*fight with all your heart, and your soul, and everything that you have, for the light, for a new dawn, for another sunrise, which would be a rebirth to the Mankind*)

That's why it is related to Interstellar. 




 GETTING GOOD AT STUDIES, ESPECIALLY IN THOSE SUBJECTS THAT YOU SUCK, IS THE BEST THING THAT CAN HAPPEN TO YOU. I WOULD LOVE SUCH A THING TO HAPPEN TO ME, A DIRECTION IN WHICH I'M TRAVELING THESE DAYS.

KUDOS BROTHER FOR THE KICK-ASS ACHIEVEMENT. 
KEEP ROCKING. 




 WHOLEHEARTED THANKS FOR THAT :) 




 ALL THIS TIME SPENT AWAY FROM SOCIAL MEDIA - WAS ABLE TO DO SOME REAL KICK-ASS THINGS.

ON THE POSITIVE SIDE:

* FINISHED READING FOUR BOOKS
* FOUNDED AN ONLINE MAGAZINE WITH A FRIEND OF MINE (CURRENTLY IN A FACEBOOK PAGE PHASE)
* REALIZED MY WEAK POINTS IN MY EXAM PREPARATION AND ALSO LEARNED THE PROPER WAY TO PRACTICE STUFF FOR IT. 
* FOUND A NEW FAVOURITE AUTHOR: *NEIL GAIMAN*. HE'S FUCKING FANTASTIC AT WHAT HE DOES.
* WROTE SOME FINE STUFF FOR MY BLOG.
* AND STARTED WRITING A FAIRY TALE.. SHALL FINISH IT THIS WEEK.

AND ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THINGS:

I REALIZED THAT I NEED TO IMPROVE MY TIME MANAGEMENT FOR PREPARING AND CRACKING THIS EXAM THING THAT I TOOK UP. IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING RIGHT NOW IN MY LIFE. I DIDN'T DO THAT WELL IN THE PAST ONE MONTH. SO THAT'S MY CONFESSION AND OPPORTUNITY FOR IMPROVEMENT.

THANKS BROTHERS FOR THE SUPPORT.. 

**I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR FROM YOU ABOUT ALL THE FUCKING GREAT SHIT (ALSO FUCKEDUP SHIT, IF ANY) THAT YOU DID IN THAT FEBRUARY MONTH.** 




  I WASNT ABOUT TO WIMP OUT IN FRONT OF HER.

THAT'S AWESOME AND PRETTY SMART, BROTHER.. KUDOS TO THAT MIND OF YOURS THAT CAME UP WITH SUCH AN IDEA :) 




 I AM TAKING A SHORT BREAK FROM SOCIAL MEDIA... FOR THE REST OF THE MONTH. I DO THIS WHENEVER I FEEL LIKE MY TIME IS BEING PUT INTO TOO MANY THINGS AT A TIME. LATELY I HAVE OBSERVED THIS WAVE TAKING SHAPE AGAIN IN MY LIFE. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THIS SUB I FUCKING LOVE VISITING HERE. BUT ALONGSIDE THIS I VISIT MANY OTHERS SUBS ON REDDIT. I KIND OF SOMETIMES PUT FUCKING TOO MUCH TIME INTO REDDIT.. DAMN, REDDIT IS ONE OF THE BEST KINDS SOCIAL FUN OUT THERE ON THE INTERNET... ANYWAYS, RIGHT NOW I AM TAKING A SHORT BREAK FROM ALL OF THAT SHIT.. REDDIT, FACEBOOK, TWITTER AND ETC..

SHALL READ BOOKS INSTEAD...

CATCH UP WITH YOU ALL NEXT MONTH BROTHERS.. MEANWHILE, CONTINUE TO ROCK YOUR FUCKING LIFE.

PEACE.

KRISHNA KANTH 




 HEY BROTHER.. THANKS A FUCKING LOT FOR POINTING A GOOD PATH. I LIKE PSYCHOLOGY. I FUCKING BELIEVE IN IT. BUT MORE THAN THAT I BELIEVE IN MYSELF. I WILL GIVE ALL THAT I GOT AND THEN SOME MORE FOR THIS FAVOURITE EXAM OF MINE AND WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. 
 




 A FEW YEARS AGO THERE CAME A TIME IN MY GODDAMN LIFE WHEN I HAD TO ABSOLUTELY REFUCKINGDEFINE IT. IN ALL ASPECTS BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY IN EDUCATION. I WAS MOVED TO MY BOWELS WITH THE NEED TO PROVE MYSELF TO THE MOTHERFUCKING WORLD AROUND ME. I WAS ASKED ON MY FACE IF I AM GOING TO BE A LOSER. I HAD TO FUCKING ANSWER THEIR ASSES WITH MY KICKING-ASS ACHIEVEMENTS. AND GUESS WHAT.. I DID. I FUCKING EXCELLED AN EXAM AND GOT INTO ONE OF THE BEST COLLEGES IN THE COUNTRY FOR MY MASTERS.

BUT, AFTER ALL THESE YEARS, NOW AT THIS PHASE OF LIFE (I AM WORKING IN AN MNC, JUST LIKE MANY PEOPLE OF MY COUNTRY DO, I'M FROM INDIA) I FEEL LIKE I HAVE RAN OUT OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS. I ONCE HAD BEEN ONE ABOVE MANY, BUT NOW I'M BEING JUST ONE AMONG ALL. I FUCKING DON'T LIKE THAT. 

**I.FUCKING.DO.NOT.LIKE.THAT!**

THERE HAD BEEN A CHALLENGE THAT I HAD RAN AWAY FROM IN THOSE ACCOMPLISHING YEARS OF MY PAST. IT WAS A NATIONAL EXAM. I BELIEVED THAT I CAN NOT CRACK IT EVER. I FEARED THAT I WILL BE CRUSHED TO DEATH BY ITS CLAWS. I WAS FUCKING AFRAID. SO I LET IT ALONE. BUT SINCE THAT DAY A PART OF MY HEART HAD BEEN HUNGRY AND DISSATISFIED KNOWING THAT I HAD EVADED THAT CHALLENGE. 

BUT GUESS WHAT MOTHERFUCKERS.. NOW I AM CALLED BACK BY IT. I'VE BEEN SUMMONED BY GOD TO PICK IT FUCKING UP AGAIN NOW AND BEAT IT TO HELL THIS TIME. SO NOW I'VE STARTED PREPARING FOR THAT FUCKING EXAM. TO FUCKING TOP IT.

BUT HERE IS THE DISAPPOINTING PART, BROTHERS. I AM FUCKING ACTING LIKE I FORGOT WHO I WAS. WHEN I SIT IN THE CLASSES FOR THE EXAM PREPARATION, THE PEOPLE AROUND ME ARE BEING FUCKING GIANTS IN KNOWLEDGE (ESPECIALLY MATH) THAT I NEED TO POSSESS TOO. I USED TO POSSESS THAT KNOWLEDGE. BUT NOW I FORGOT ALL THAT GLORY.

LAST WEEK MY MIND WAS FUCKED WHEN I SAW ALL THOSE PEOPLE ANSWERING THE QUESTIONS AND I DIDN'T HAVE A FUCKING CLUE.

**BUT I CAN NOT LEAVE IT AGAIN. I WILL FUCKING NOT. I WILL LOOK THIS CHALLENGE IN THE FACE AND SPIT ON IT. I WILL TIE THIS CHALLENGE TO MY MIND'S BED AND FUCKING RAPE IT EVERY NIGHT. I WILL GRAB MY FEAR OF THIS EXAM BY ITS HAIR AND FEED ITS FUCKING ENTRAILS TO MY SPIRIT-HOUNDS.**

YES I FORGOT MY HISTORY AND PAST GLORY.. NEVERTHELESS, I WILL REWRITE IT WITH THE NEW STORY. 




 ON PATH TO SOME MINDBLOWING GREATNESS IN THIS GODDAMN LIFE, GIVE WHATEVER THE FUCK YOU'VE GOT TO IT....**AND THEN SOME MORE!**

THAT IS THE MOST GODDAMN PART: **SOME MORE** 

IT IS WHAT SHOWS THE REAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOU AND EVERY OTHER FUCKER PUT TOGETHER. 

**SOME MORE** IS WHAT TURNS 45 MINUTES INTO AN HOUR.

**SOME MORE** IS WHAT CONVERTS PRETTY MUCH TO 'PRECISE'.

**SOME MORE** IS WHAT FINISHES THE RACE.

**SOME MORE** IS WHAT MAKES YOU COMPLETE.

 




 Agatha Christie is an author that I'm yet to try.... Will do it this year.. Thanks 




 thanks....  




 awesome... thanks for the suggestions..  




 There was a Telugu movie I saw a long time ago.. and there is this scene where the heroine goes to an interview and the interviewer, after finishing all his questions, asks her to close her eyes and speak out what all the things she saw in the room from the time she entered. She tells a good detail of things in the room like wall poosters, clocks, or books and especially (here is the kind the books I want to ask for) she tells about the items placed on either sides of his hands on the table and thus deduces that the interviewer is a left handed person. I really liked her observations skills especially of the handedness...

Now, can somebody please suggest me some books where I can learn about such stuff??

Thank you so much. 




 THAT'S A REAL FUCKING ADVICE BROTHER.. THANK YOU. 

YES. I WILL DO WHAT IS UNFUCKINGCOMFORTABLE AND MAKE IT MY FUCKBUDDY.. **I WILL MAKE DISCOMFORT MY CHISEL AND WILL FUCKING SCULPT MY DREAM WITH IT.** 




 (FROM INDIA) VERY UPLIFTING POST, BROTHER. A DAY STARTED WITH READING A BOOK IS ONE OF A KIND I TELL YOU. TO START A DAY THAT WAY WHERE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE DON'T EVEN READ A SINGLE BOOK FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR, IS A KICK-ASS KIND OF LIVING. I'M HAPPY TO SAY THAT I LOVE READING TOO. THAT BEING SAID, NOW REGARDING MY DAILY ROUTINE:

I USED TO MEDIDATE FIRST THING IN THE MORNING, BUT THAT ROUTINE DETERIORATED A BIT RECENTLY. I'M TRYING TO GET BACK TO IT. APART FROM THIS, I START MY DAY BY STUDYING FOR A NATIONAL LEVEL ENTRANCE EXAM THAT I'M PREPARING FOR. I HAVE A DAY JOB AS WELL.

WHEN I START MY DAY WITH SOMETHING PRODUCTIVE IN THE BASKET I FEEL REALLY GOOD FOR THE ENTIRE DAY. ESPECIALLY WHEN I MEDIDATE FIRST THING IN THE MORNING, THE REST OF THE DAY IS PERSPICUOUSLY DIFFERENT FROM EVERY OTHER DAY.

FORTUNATELY TODAY I MEDIDATED BEFORE STARTING MY DAY.

APART FROM THAT, I MOSTLY PLAN THE EXAM STUDIES BEFORE I GO TO BED. THIS HELPS ME LAUNCH MYSELF DIRECTLY INTO PRODUCTIVE MODE THE NEXT MORNING RATHER THAN INVESTING TIME IN DECIDING WHAT TO WORK ON.

THERE ARE TIMES WHEN MY PLANS GET DISTURBED.. BUT I'M TRYING TO BRING ORDER TO SUCH CHAOS.  
























 That's cool... I was obsessed with mine when last year I tried to grow long hair... no haircut for 8 months... Finally cut it in this Feb.. Now am trying to grow longer than last year... 




 It's not my favourite of all the 7 books but it is one of the first HP books I picked up in my reading life... I EXTREMELY enjoyed reading *Order of the Phoenix* and can never forget the feel I got everytime I saw that cover page when the book was waiting on my table for me. 




 In your flair.. "Enemies of the hair, Beware" is that a spelling mistake?? Did you mean "heir"?? Just asking. 




 Yeah me too.. 




 There is only a fine line that separates confidence from over-confidence, and Dumbledore, irrespective of his magnificent magical ablities, never crossed that line for a show-off. He's an epitome of humility. 




  calling him "Tom" and generally not giving a fuck. 

Dumbledore all along! 




  If there's one thing that struck me hard in the fight between Dumbledore and Voldemort was with how much confidence Dumbledore entered the fight.

I just *love* it when somebody praises my favourite character. 




 If only I could announce 50 points to OP for this post. 




 this quote stinks! 














 Thank you for the great book names...  




 Earth Day special... 




 This one sentence can stand as an inspiration to those who are looking out for justifying their creative and artistic desires. 




 [Bombay is a big city in India](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai) 




 Let's talk about the books that glorify the life of earth, its nature, its children and its unending wonders..

The books that made me realize the worth and wonder of earth are undoubtedly 

* Henry David Thoreau's *Walden* and 
* Ralph Waldo Emerson's essay called *Nature.* 

Those two works are some of the best things I've ever read about nature. 

After I read them, I truly felt the wonder of being a part of such a miraculous thing called the Mother Earth.

Please share here your favourite Earth Day reads and how they made you realize the magic of living here... 

Thank you all, and have a magical day today :) :) 




 Goodreads is fine. Not an unliveable-without, though. 




  Please differentiate between TED and TEDx

Sorry about that. Will keep in mind next time. Thanks. 









 deep and strong... 




  That said, there's a huge benefit in being able to see your ideas written out in front of you in your own handwriting. 

Exactly. That's what I meant when I said it was a good idea. 




 Hey that's a pretty good way to start up with the idea exploration stuff.. It puts a structure in your mind, thus eliminating all the time that we consume in hovering over the thoughts of where to go next.. 

*Organizing* - a really cool tip to write faster. Thanks :) 




 beautifully deep!! 




 sounds interesting... shall check it out.. 




 It has already been on my reading list for this year.. Thanks for the mention :) 




  On the Road by Jack Kerouac

Heard a lot about this one... Will read it soon! 




  I found the first-person perspective gave a fascinating insight into the main character's mind as his situation worsened.

Stephen King rocks at such stuff... Thanks. I will pick it up..
 




 oh that's a very good advice.. thanks :) 




 I recently read Herman Hesse's *Steppenwolf* and I was held all along by the inner voice of the protagonist. Also, Stephen King's *Hearts In Atlantis* has three different characters narrating different stories in the three novellas along the book.

What are some of your favourite books with great first person narratives?? 




 by Max Brooks, right?? 









 *Angels and Demons* by Dan Brown. 




  A bit embarrassingly

There is nothing embarrassing about keeping the child in you alive...  




 Stories have shaped up my life and made me what I'm today (I'm an aspiring novelist from India). I felt indebted to all those books that had shown me my true purpose in life. So, I decided to bring in such a change in the lives of many young children out there. I'm collecting the ideas to incorporate in my venture with books. My primary focus is in expanding children's reach into books, thus bringing in imagination and creativity into their lives. 

Please share any other ideas that you think would be great for them to shape their fate with the help of books.

Thank you so much :) 




 WATCH THIS FILM BRO: [BHAAG MILKHA BHAAG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhaag_Milkha_Bhaag)

[HERE IS ITS AWESOME TRAILER](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY3qfhYPJSI)

IT'S A TRUE FUCKING STORY OF A LEGENDARY RUNNER FROM INDIA (ALSO AN OLYMPIAN). TO GIVE YOU A GLIMPSE OF THE FILM I WOULD LIKE TO QUOTE HERE MY FAVOURITE SCENE:


*OPPOSITE TEAM'S COACH*: **"THIS MIGHT PROBABLY BE YOUR LIFE'S LAST RACE"**

*MILKHA SINGH*: **"I WILL RUN AS IF IT IS"** 




 MAKE SURE ONE CHALLENGES YOUR FUCKING BODY AND THE OTHER YOUR FUCKING MIND.

THIS MOTHERFUCKER IS ONE GODDAMN JEWEL OF AN ADVICE. 









 Thanks.. but that's not a grass field.. it's a pond filled with some water plants.  









 Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell 









 *The Ocean at the End of the Lane* introduced me to Neil Gaiman, But I was firstly fascinated by his Tumblr advices and his talks prior to my reading his book. He's awesome! 









 very cool collection.... especially Harry Potter.. huge fan..

I've a csv file with multiple columns. I'm considering only two of them, 'Time' and 'RiseOrFall'. Both are of Factor datatype. Sample data looks like:

    Time RiseOrFall  
    12   32
    34   0  
    56   0
    78   25
    90   29
    123  0
    567  50

I'm trying to create a line chart in R that falls everytime 'RiseOrFall' hits 0 and rises when it's not 0. ('Time' on x-axis and 'RiseOrFall' on Y-axis)

I tried:

countFile - read.csv(file = "counts.csv", nrows = 1000)[, c ('TIME','TRPM')]

ggplot(data=countFile, aes(x=TRPM)) + geom_line()

How can this be achieved in R (possibly using ggplot2 or anything)?? 




 I just read your comment in Gatsby's (Leonardo DiCaprio) voice :) 




 NOW THAT I'VE ADVISED YOU IN MY PREVIOUS COMMENT ON HOW TO WAKE UP EARLY, NOW LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING HUGELY IMPORTANT. THNKING THAT WAKING UP EARLY WILL INSTANTLY SOLVE ALL YOUR PROBLEMS IS A GODDAMN MISFUCKINGCONCEPTION.. WAKING UP EARLY IS SURELY A GOOD THING NO DOUBT, HOWEVER IT CAN ALSO END UP GIVING YOU MORE PRODUCTIVE TIME TO DO UNPRODUCTIVE TASKS.. SO BE WARNED WHEN YOU WAKE UP AT 4AM ONE MORNING AND FIND YOURSELF DOING THE BEST PROCRASTIANTION EVER IN YOUR LIFE.. THIS IS SOMETHING YOU GOTTA KEEP IN MIND. 

BUT NO WORRIES THERE. I'VE GOT A SOLUTION FOR THAT AS WELL. WHEN YOU DECIDE TO WAKE UP EARLY, TAKE A NOTEBOOK THE BEFORE DAY NIGHT AND WRITE UP IN THERE WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IN THE WHOLE OF NEXT DAY. THIS WILL SAVE YOUR VALUABLE TIME IN THE MORNING FROM GETTING LOST IN THE THOUGHTS OF THINKING WHAT TO DO.

TRY THIS AND SHARE YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH OUR OTHER BROTHERS IN THE SUB IF YOU LIKE TO.

GOOD LUCK! 




 THERE IS ONE SIMPLE TECHNIQUE FOR WAKING UP EARLY.. DRINK LOTS OF WATER AT NIGHT JUST BEFORE YOU GO TO BED. THEN NOTHING FROM HEAVEN AND EARTH CAN STOP YOU FROM WAKING UP AND RUNNING TO THE BATHROOM. AND WHEN YOU DO, WHEN YOU FINISH PEEING, SPLASH SOME WATER ON YOUR FACE, ALSO BRUSH YOUR FUCKING TEETH RIGHT AWAY... AND TA DA.. **YOU WILL BE WIDE AWAKE AS FUCK!!** 




 great... 









 I love paradoxes! 




 Let me explain in detail why I had to come up with this post.
I recently observed a pattern in my reading. I tend to read fantasy and fairy tale related books in rainy season.. I get a vague feeling inside my heart when it is cloudy or raining.. My mind immediately starts to pick the thoughts of magical realms, dark forests, curses and other fantastical stuff. 

I'm not exactly sure about all of this but I guess I know when did all of this start in my life. I'm an aspiring writer. In 2013, when I was a computer science student, I faced some health issues and had to travel back home from my university. It was a journey of 2 days and all that time I was sitting beside a glass window in an AC coach, and was peering out of it. It had been raining most of the journey and so the surroundings outside were drenched, and the greenery that resulted was dark and deeply scenic. Slowly my mind started to think back into a few years and I remembered a favourite fantasy movie of mine: *Pan's Labyrinth.* The film was adorned in fantastic visuals and colour. And now the things I was looking at out of the train window were at par with those that I saw in the film. I felt  abruptly different. My mind started to wander into myriad impossible realms. I just enjoyed the feeling while it lasted.

After I reached home I was prescribed to rest for a couple of weeks until to grow hale and healthy again. So, during that time I picked some books from my shelf, one is *Words from the Myths* by Isaac Asimov, it is full of Greek and Roman mythologies, and the other one was an old edition of National Geographic Magazine with the cover story about *Grimms' Fairy Tales.* The magazine also contained some breathtaking imagery of rain forests that that pertained to other articles in the mag. All along the time I was reading those books it had been raining outside (it was monsoon time). And something about it all got implanted in my mind during that time. Ever since then, whenever the sky turns dark and gloomy with clouds I vaguely start to think of fantasy stories and fairy tales. This even inspired me to write some poetry and bring up some short story ideas during rainy season.

That's the story behind my post. Sorry I had to share it.

Do any of you too have some similar experiences where the weather and the season outside influenced what you read???
 




 Goddamnit, OP, put the source beside a quote. ~*Napoleon Hill*
 




 Thank you :) 




 [Upside Down](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1374992/) is a very good science fiction/fantasy film with an innovative plot.. I would like to read such books.. Know of any?? 




  Who needs fresh air anyway.

There is not much of it in the world anyway. 




 One of a kind... Too good, man. 









 I stay in India.. Will you be willing to send it this far??? If so, thank you so very much. 




  Isaac Asimov's Encyclopedia of Science and Technology from the 1960s.

I consider you to be a damn lucky person. I've been looking for Asimov's non-fiction books in every second hand bookstore that I have visited but with no good success. I only found Opus (both Opus 100   Opus 200 in one) book. I love his non-fiction. 




 *Opus 100* by Isaac Asimov - experiences of Asimov while writing his first 100 books. 




 the first table. (Table 1) with two columns (X,Y) 




 I'm a beginner at Statistics.. Am learning the basic concepts and graphs in Stats. Today, when I was [checking out Residual Plots](http://stattrek.com/regression/residual-analysis.aspx?tutorial=ap) I got stuck with this doubt (asked in the post title). Please help.


 




 In [this](http://onlinestatbook.com/2/regression/intro.html) tutorial, if you see just above Table 1, the following text is written.

*The example data in Table 1 are plotted in Figure 1. You can see that there is a positive relationship between X and Y. If you were going to predict Y from X, the higher the value of X, the higher your prediction of Y. *

But the predicted Y values have decreased for two X values, (3 and 5). Then why was it mentioned as "the higher the value of X, the higher your prediction of Y" in the above paragraph???  




 Yes.. I meant Krakauer.. I always get confused between their names.. But yeah On The Road is also on my list.. 




 Read his *Into The Wild* - absolutely loved it. 




 Ever since I'd read Thoreau's works, especially *Walden*, *Civil Disobedience* and recently, *Walking,* I started to firmly believe that Henry had lived by the values that he advocated in his lifetime. 

And, Isaac Asimov is another person. He worked towards knowledge all of his life, and just take a look at what he produced in his time - immensely ingenious work.

People acting their words and beliefs.. that's something that we rarely see in the world. 

After that realization, I wanted to know of those authors who walked their talk.. 

Can you please name some??? Would love to learn about them. 




 This is easily one of the most creative posts of this sub! 




 Mark Twain is Batman! 




 I upvote anything that's from Thoreau... 




 looks like i should give this book a try. 




 Oh didn't know about this.. Thank you so much... 




 Hey, OP, I'm 25 as well. I too sometimes feel the same way about my writing.. but that's the beauty of it, pal. You got to look at that mountain and feel overwhelmed by it, and then you gotto go ahead and start climbing. It's going to be tough, yet you have to keep up with it. Person who dislikes darkness can never know the beauty of the Moon. I don't want you to be that person; heck, I don't want anybody to be that person. Because at the core of our hearts, we're all *artists,* and artists do undergo such emotional journeys. 

You can write! 




  Look at how you describe the ghostwriter's ability. Can you not feel that emotion coursing through your own words?

Ex-fucking-actly...!!! 




 Twain... Twain... he is something.. I was left speechless by the book *What Is Man?* by Mark Twain. It's a small book, (a discussion between a young boy and an old man) and sheds a lot of light on the issue that argues how we as humans can't create thoughts and ideas from nothing, how our ideas are never original and are all influenced by one thing or the other. The book is full of intellectual enlightenment...  




 FUCKING AWESOME! 




 STEPHEN KING, INTERSTELLAR, A.R.RAHMAN, EARTH, YOU... 




 Jaden, is that you??? 




 I was spellbound by the way Christopher Nolan connected the climax of *Interstellar* film to a bookshelf. I seriously take it to be his tribute to the world of books. Also, the film *Into The Wild* talks of some of best books, like Thoreau's *Walden*, that had influenced Chris McCandless set out to do what he did with his life. I love the movies that do such things.

What are some of the movies that payed tribute to books that stand as influence to many people around the world?? 




 FUCKING AWESOME PRANK, MOD! 




  THIS POST WAS NOT VERY MOTIVATING

THE POST IN ITSELF WAS NOT MEANT TO MOTIVATE.. IT WAS MEANT TO BRING A FUCKING LAUGH ON ALL OF OUR FACES.. AND THAT LAUGH IS WHAT SHOULD MOTIVATE OUR FUCKING HEADS AND HEARTS. 

LAUGH BROTHER.. A GODDAMN HEARTFILLING LAUGH IS WHAT WE FUCKING LIVE FOR. 




 Are we vaguely having some superpower??? I mean, seriously...?? 




 Something about that child coming back to life brought me so much peace.. so much. 









 Why do you even fucking care about that! 









  Not exactly cool

Sometimes that's the new cool. 




 OK.. that's just the Indian way of speaking English... Please don't mind.. :P 




 Bro... your words just boiled my blood.... especially the last one, 'iconic.' 




 Awesome...!!! 




 Typeface, font, whatever the fuck it is, it is shit...!!  




  IF YOU DIDN'T THEN YOU SHOULD GET KICKED IN THE BALLS THEN DO THIS WORK WHILE BEING LIT ON FIRE.

THAT SOUNDS LIKE A VERY ASS-MOVING WAY TO GET THINGS DONE. THANKS, BROTHER. 









  at /r/dreams

Didn't know about that before.. thanks mod :) 




  I've had experiences when my phone rings and I know who is calling before looking at the caller ID.

Yes. I too experienced this in the recent past.. This is true for some SMSs as well...  




 *Saving Private Ryan* all along.. 




 Comparing car stuff with space shuttle stuff... Phew, muggles everywhere. 




 You can't April Fool me with this... 




  Critics have never been able to really appreciate Christopher Nolan.

True.. they're real hypocrites.. 




 exactly.. it was awesome...  




 Is this by any chance a Fools Day prank?? 









 [](/crying)

Thank you so much!!  




 This is one of the greatest quotes ever. It belongs on the front page. 




 I like paradoxes.. 




 Herman Hesse is such an author who can wake up the thoughts of your life from their eternal sleep and make them bring a cup of coffee for you. Liked very much his *Siddhartha* and loved his *Steppenwolf.* 




   If you have no ideas, why do you want to write in the first place? 

Exactly...  




  Don't even get me started on all the short story ideas. 

Hello, brother.. 




 Yeah will do that... I myself need to improve my writing a lot :/  which is why my critiques aren't great.. Will work in that direction as well. Thanks. 




 Thank you for the detailed critique.. I'm pretty new to writing fiction/stories. This is just my third one, I guess. So, all your inputs regarding my writing will be of utmost help for me. Thank you so much for pointing out where it can be bettered.. 

 It was a very nice tale that could have been improved by writing. 

I've good ideas for great stories but the execution is still a little on the lower side. I will have to work on that and I will surely do. 

Thank you once again for the encouragement. 




  The energetic current of passing period echoed through the rusting yellow bars of the classroom's windows.

*classroom windows* would've simply sounded better.

 Was it really this easy?

Was *what* really that easy?

 Ducks are cowards, she explained in cool, clear English, and when you yell at them they run.

I liked that line. Hey, your writing went smooth in the paragraph above that line. Good.

 By creating distance from your life, distance brought not just by physical space but also by time, you gain a lens with which to look back.

You might want to re-write that sentence in a better way. Just try once.

Overall, a connect is missing in the entire piece.. You do have a nice thought process going on in your mind, but we all need to practice more to give those thoughts a better shape. Let's do that. All the best :)
 




 Sorry sir, I don't think I'm leeching.. I just critiqued two submissions here.. One before my submission and one after. Have been away from this sub for a while. That is all. If you still think I'm leeching, please tell me why do you think so. Thanks. 




 She opened the screen door and stepped out onto the porch.  A breeze rippled her black dress and the crucifix around her neck.  Her dog followed her and it stopped in the threshold.

The paragraph has been tough to read. The flow of words and the way they sounded in my mind wasn't pleasant.

Their yard was small but it had held their family happily for eight years.

*Their yard was small but it had happily held their family for eight years.* Sounds better for me.

Their lawn was covered in a canvas of red and yellow and brown and blackened leaves that heavy winds pushed into wet, huddled clumps.

No no.. something is sounding really bad about all those words.

The paragraph where he dragged the dog out was smooth read.

Well tough shit because this is hard.  I dont want to have to tell my parents about this.  Maybe it will be okay for you but not for me.  Her eyes burned again.    She twisted the rings on her fingers in futile circles.

Ok. So, many of people out there are having tough time with the commas, huh! I always thought it was just me. 

 She stared back across the street.  Her delicate hands curled into jagged fists.

Oh there's a female in the story! Sorry, didn't realize that all along till the pronoun came up. But hey, does that say anything to you??

 such a clear kind of white, such a clear kind of blue

That just repeated twice in one sentence. May be you would want to rewrite it.

Overall, a tough read.. not smooth according to me - unfortunately didn't paint the picture that you were thinking in your mind when you were writing it. May be you might want to try a bit more.

Art is all about doing better, practicing with passion.. So, you and I got a lot of that in front of us. I wish you all the best for the new things you're going to write soon :) 




 English is not my native language (from India).. But I love writing in English. I like fairy tales and fantasy... So, I recently penned a short fairy tale. Please help me by destroying anything that you didn't like about the story or the writing. (Also, I'm pretty excited about using a penname for the first time in my life..)

[Here is the link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gL6hs0iBEDJKy1YoUUsVJTd_lCXPWi4Yd8_ARfPtJ7A/edit?usp=sharing)
Thanks. 




 Maximilian Collard did not have the frame of an agile man. The rock beneath his fingers was uncomfortably angular, but he gripped it tightly anyway. The pain was a fleeting inconvenience for a climber as experienced as he. Far below, he could make out the uneven straw-padded outline of a Gryphon nest. One egg, no adults.

The opening paragraph was very good and painted a perfect picture of a rock climber or a cliff hanger.... But the rest of the thing was clumsy and not engaging much... I'm sure you can do better.. All the best :) 




 My friend deeply needs this at his workplace... thanks!! 




 Hey that's pretty helpful... thnx :) 




 Any idea if the entire event will be available online on Youtube or elsewhere??? 




 (From India.) I graudated last year and have been working in IT industry since a year. I'm Comp. Sci grad. I work with an MNC, and recently I've shown interest in chatting about Analytics and Data Science related stuff with some senior management of *Business Intelligence* domain in my organization. Now when a new project in Data Science is coming up for the org, they've chosen me to work in that project. Although I feel pretty happy and pleased about that, I sometimes also feel overwhelmed by the stuff I need to learn in Data Science. I was told to improve my Statistics skills and other Data Science related skillset on an urgent basis. 

So, it would be really helpful if you can provide me with a list (that doesn't scare-off a newbie) of skills that I need to develop in order to become good at Data Science.

Note: Although I'm a comp sci grad, my interest has never been towards programming and algorightms... I like Database related stuff like SQL etc. So, please also suggest me what specific programming and algo skills I might need now.

Thank you. 




 I too am an aspiring writer. I like synopsis of stories that one plans to write.. I myself used to write them when I develop an idea of the storyline in my mind. So, I would say that the synopsis of your story sounded very good and pretty deep sci-fi. The presence of sci-fi aspects was clearly apparent, I guess that's pretty much necessary when you're offering a glimpse into your work to a publisher. The story was good but how you wrote the book is what finally matters for the audience, and by looking at how you wrote the summary, I would assume that you wrote a pretty engaging book. So, I can only wish you all the very best.. Hoping some good news to reach you soon about your book publishing :)
 









 Good to know that you found what you were looking for. 





























 THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ENJOYING THE POST. I JUST CHECKED YOU OUT AND FOUND OUT THAT YOU HAVEN'T BEEN AROUND REDDIT FOR A LONG WHILE (ATLEAST DIDN'T MAKE ANY POSTS OR COMMENTS) ASSUMING YOU'RE NEW TO [/R/ALLCAPSMOTIVATION](http://www.reddit.com/r/allcapsmotivation/), I WOULD JUST LIKE TO LET YOU KNOW THAT LOWERCASES ARE NOT SOMETHING WE APPRECIATE AROUND THIS SUB.. (I WAS GENTLE WHILE WRITING THAT, ACTUALLY WE FUCKING ABHOR, LOATHE, AND HATE THE GODDAMN LOWERCASE LETTERS WITH ALL OF OUR FUCKING HEARTS.)

AND APPARENTLY YOU'RE AN ASPIRING WRITER (IF I'M NOT WRONG). DO SHARE SOME OF YOUR WORKS HERE IF YOU THINK THEY ARE RELATED TO WHAT THIS SUB STANDS FOR. IF NOT YOU CAN PM ME THE LINKS. I'M AN ASPIRING WRITER TOO SO I WOULD TRY TO READ THEM. ALL THE BEST FOR YOUR WRITING.)

GO KICK-ASS. 




 The collection contains short poetic/prose pieces.. I'm an aspiring writer, and sometimes I pen my heartfelt words on Tumblr and other social media. I've collected some of them that I've written recently, around some 25 short works.

Art is something that intrgues me with its grandeur. It makes me think better and feel more lively when I do my writing. So, I would love to see my writings blended with beautiful illustrations. If anyone is interested in this, please PM me your email id and I shall mail you the document containing my works.

(Please note that I won't be using your art work for any kind of money earning, so I won't be able to offer you any money in exchange to the work you do. This is purely out of passion for the art.)

Thank you.
 




 Ok. Thanks for clarifying the doubt. 




 I have something for you. I too am still a guy who can not understand poetry well.. I needed English prose translation of epic poetry (such as Paradise Lost) that was already written in English. I'm that bad.. (also English is not my native, I'm from India) But here is the catch: Poetry, when felt and enjoyed, tastes as good as honey.. I'm not kidding. I don't understand most poetry and yet I keep reading it now and then, for it has some jewels written in its sentences, sentences that standout as quotes.. I read poetry especially to dig out such sentences even if I don't understand what is going on in the entire poem. I do this because I am not prepared to miss the sentences like: 

*"Beauty is truth, truth beauty,that is all Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know."*
just because I don't understand poetry (by the way the above are the closing lines from John Keats' *Ode on a Grecian Urn.*)


But I also mostly enjoy Edgar Allan Poe's poetry very well.. I fell in love with poetry itself only when I read Poe's short poetry, primarily, *Eldorado.*



**Eldorado**

Gaily bedight, 

A gallant knight,

In sunshine and in shadow,

Had journeyed long,

Singing a song,

In search of Eldorado.




But he grew old-

This knight so bold-

And o'er his heart a shadow

Fell as he found

No spot of ground

That looked like Eldorado.




And, as his strength

Failed him at length,

He met a pilgrim shadow-

"Shadow," said he,

"Where can it be-

This land of Eldorado?"




"Over the Mountains

Of the Moon,

Down the Valley of the Shadow,

Ride, boldly ride,"

The shade replied-

"If you seek for Eldorado!"







And another poem by Edgar Allan Poe has the following lines, which is what interested me to look into Poe in the first place:




*All that we see or seem*

*Is but a dream within a dream.*



And I prefer short poetry over long ones.. *Mary Olivers* is a new poet that I'm planning to look into soon this year. 




 Last year I read Peter Ustinov's *Loser.* I felt extremely happy when I reached the last page. When I finished the book, it felt like I came out of a boring place with a relief that came from knowing I don't have to go back to it ever again. 




 Hmm.. I'm pretty sure wands aren't involved in apparation. I don't remember anybody using a wand while apparating. I guess we need some expert's opinion here. 




 I felt extremely dissatisfied when the Dumbledore's Funeral (chapter 'Phoenix Lament') was not there in the film. Albus completely deserved that respect, but David Fucking Yates didn't think so! 




 But nobody uses a wand to apparate, do they?

THAT'S FOR NOW FROM VOLUME 1. THESE ARE THE WORDS OF OUR OWN FELLOW BROTHERS HERE.. HOPE YOU LIKE THEM. LET THEM PUMP YOUR FUCKING GUTS UP WHEN YOU ARE IN A FUCKING NEED.
 




  MY OTHER DREAM IS FOR THIS SUB TO HIT TEN THOUSAND SUBSCRIBERS. GOD DAMN THAT WOULD BE MOTIVATING.

THAT WOULD BE FUCKING AWESOME.. I WANT IT WITH ALL OF MY HEART. I'M TRYING MY BEST TOWARDS THAT AS WELL. 




  I'M GOING TO FINISH KHAN ACADEMY MATH THROUGHOUT THE SUMMER. EDUCATION IS PRICELESS.

THAT'S A GREAT IDEA. AND YES EDUCATION IS PRICELESS.

 IM SO PUMPED FOR LIFE

I GUESS I TOO AM. THANKS.


 




  I WANT TO BE ABLE TO SAIL AROUND THE WORLD AND EXPERIENCE ALL THE DIFFERENT CULTURES I CAN (AND MAYBE HUNT SOME PIRATES IN SOMALIA BECAUSE FUCK PIRATES)

MOD BROTHER, NOW THAT WOULD MAKE A GREAT PLOT FOR A NEW TV SERIES OR A MOVIE OR A FUCKING AWESOME NOVEL. YOU AND YOUR WIFE SAILING ALL AROUND THE WORLD WHILE PROTECTING PEOPLE THAT ARE BEING TROUBLED BY FUCKING PIRATES. YOU BOTH CAN BE REAL BADASSES IN THE HEARTS OF THOSE MOTHERFUCKERS. 




  MY DREAM IS THAT IF I KEEP DOING MY ABSOLUTE BEST EVERYDAY THEN I'LL BE ABLE TO SORT IT OUT AS I GO.

THANK YOU BROTHER FOR THE RESPONSE. YOUR THOUGHT PROCESS IS VERY INSPIRING. I WISH YOU ALL THE BEST AS YOU MARCH AHEAD TOWARDS THAT BEAUTIFULLY MYSTERIOUS DESTINY OF YOURS. 




 IT IS SO FUCKING RARE THAT ONE WOULD SPEAK OF THEIR DREAMS IN LIFE FROM THE BOTTOM OF HIS HEART. LET US DO THAT TODAY HERE IN OUR FAVOURITE GODDAMN SUB.. LET'S SHARE WITH EACH OTHER WHAT WE FUCKING WANT TO BE, WHAT WE FUCKING WANT TO DO BEFORE OUR TIME IS FUCKING DONE IN THIS WORLD. ALSO TELL WHAT YOU ARE FUCKING DOING RIGHT NOW TO REACH THAT DREAM.

I WANT TO BE A GODDAMN GREAT WRITER. I WANT TO BE AN ENGLISH LANGUAGE NOVELIST. BUT ENGLISH IS NOT MY FUCKING NATIVE LANGUAGE. I'M FROM INDIA. SO I'M READING BOOKS AND ALSO PRACTICING MY WRITING SKILLS BY WRITING SHORT STORIES IN ENGLISH. I'VE ALL THESE REALLY COOL IDEAS IN MY MIND AND I WANT TO PUT THEM IN MY WORDS. I'VE TAKEN UP THE JOURNEY IN THAT DIRECTION.

NOW, BROTHERS, WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ACHIEVE YOUR DREAMS?

 




 Andy Weir's short story, [The Egg](http://www.galactanet.com/oneoff/theegg_mod.html), reflects this perfectly. 




 It was midnight and I was hungry. (telling)

*It was 2AM. My messenger on the Facebook chat window was beeping, usual good night messages probably, but it can wait.* I thought as I made my way into the kitchen to dig out anything edible that was brought in by me when I wasn't such a lazy idiot as I'd been since morning. 

 




  A fist clenched, then unclenched slowly.

Perfect.. He just became angry and then he tried controlling himself. I just *saw* that in your words..  




 Cool 




 You just really showed.. Thanks :) 




 Yes, definitely one of the most powerful moments shown in words... And I was just making fun of myself :) 




 Thank you so much for the response :) 




 Long back I discovered a [writing advice from Chuck Palahniuk on 'showing, and not telling'](http://1000wordseveryday.tumblr.com/post/54758529019/writing-advice-by-chuck-palahniuk-in-six) here. It had been an immediate help for something that I was doing then. I would really like to know more of such tips and techniques. If any of you guys have any resources (articles or anything) about *"show, don't tell"* rule of writers, please share them here. It would be an awesome help :) 




 I won't deny their iconicity.. I was merely pointing out my apparently mundane memory power :P 




 I'll tell you the names of the books I didn't like:

* The Divine Invasion
* The Man Who Japed

No fun reading those two really. Disappointed. But nevertheless something about PKD makes me feel interested in his works. I've got lots and lots more to try still. 




 how about naming it "rBooks" as a tribute to this sub??? 




 The way the book ends is pretty deep.. Although I don't remember the names of the characters, I can never forget how the protagonist must've felt when he points that gun at the back of his friend's head. I will always remember that. 




 Ubik is said to be similar to Inception film... I'm quite excited that there is such a book since I loved that film. This year I've plans to pick up his short stories. I've seen films based on  upon PKD's stories, namely *Minority Report* and *The Adjustment Bureau*.. Since then I'm interested in reading his short stories. 




 I'm from India too.. What MissMumbai pointed out here is a true superstition in our country.. There were instances during my childhood where friends used to swear on education and all that stuff... It was fun. 




 It's good to laugh... Watch TV series *The Big Bang Theory* and you might even die laughing. It's that good. 




  Named after how many people remember that Nelson Mandela died ages ago in prison, except that never happened.

Who are those people that remember him dying in prison?? How do they know that he died there?? Was there official news in the papers or were they also sharing prison with him?  




 I observed lot of people talking of *Mandela Effect* in this post.. What actually is Mandela Effect?? 




 Melamed was born with muscular dystrophy, which causes progressive weakness and loss of muscle mass throughout the body. As the disease progresses, people with the condition have difficulty doing physical activities like running and walking.

And he kicked its ass like a boss!

Thank you so much for the article, dan17555. 









 "I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious." -Albert Einstein

It's very encouraging to hear something like that from such a genius. 




 The following is my favourite quote that talks of similar stuff:

"The future is a choice between what's right and what's easy." -Albus Dumbledore, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. 




 Well noted. 




 I showed this to a friend of mine and he said that the OP can impress can any girl with his drawing skills.... Lucky fellow OP!! 




 unfuckingbelievable! 









  When you're little and you think there's a monster under your bed, you usually run to your parents. Because you see them as infallible human beings and trust implicitly that they're capable of handling whatever horrible creature is under your bed. 
 Harry never had that. He had to handle his own monsters. And Voldemort is no different.

These closing lines of your analysis are deeply insightful. Can't deny that. Awesome :) 




  What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us.

This one was [attributed to Henry David Thoreau.](http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/h/henrydavid145971.html) 




  We are practically living in science fiction

Yeah.. I feel this sometimes... 




 I just installed WriteMonkey.. but I couldn't access any sounds in the program... There is a 'sounds' folder with some sound types in it, but I didn't find any option to access them in Preferences. If you know of how to access sounds in WriteMonkey please help. 




 As you've said that the book is free till Friday I was just trying to download it to my Kindle.. but it says something like $8...?? Why was it not free?? Or is the kindle edition not available for $0.00 in the Indian Amazon market?? 




 THAT WOULD BE A FUCKING GREAT HONOUR, MOD.  




 Thanks :) 




 Congratulations for the achievement.. I would like to know how many pages does the book spans into? 

(also did I say it correctly when I said 'spans into'??  I am from India. English is not my native.. I too am learning to write!) 




 Thanks for the information :) 




 I often wonder how writers use typewriters, which doesn't offer the features of deleting something and retyping it, or clearing off a printed sentence or editing it.. much like a computer keyboard does. To do any of these on an actual typewriter, it would waste lot of paper, right? So, how do writers manage to use them instead of a keyboard or a word document where they don't have to waste an entire paper for every typo or a change in words or sentences they decide to make?? 

But I want to get the feel of a typewriter and see what's there.. Is there any software that combines the feel of a typewriter alongside providing the features of a keyboard? 









 I had always liked the concept of this book where the two look alikes from distinct lifestyles swap their appearances and unfortunately it stretches too far and brings in bigger changes in their lives than they've asked for.. I wanted to read the book and so picked it up last month. But to my surprise I discovered that all the characters in the book are speaking archaic English langauge. 

So the book is seeming very tough and an extrememly slow read, and it's tough to concentrate on the plot. Because of all this my excitement for the book is dwindling.

I really wish *The Prince and the Pauper* was written in normal/modern English :( 









 *Outliers* is undoubtedly the best of all his books.. Oh what a grand non-fiction book it is! 




  Do not go into that good night,

Do not go **gentle** into that good night... the most important word was missing. 




 :) :) 




 :) :) 




 I never really liked the book covers that have something like real pictures on them... 




  i always saw the harry/hermione dynamic more brother/sister

My thoughts exactly... 




 If you look at *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban* there is something called as Time Turner which is used by Hermione to attend extra classes, it is also the object which Dumbledore advices Harry to use by the end of the book to travel back in time and set things right.. There is not any explanation given as to the working of time turner itself but the story just carries on with its help and presence. So, maybe you can simply come up with something like that and take your story forward.. And also there is a book by Stephen King called *11/22/63* where a teacher travels back in time to stop the assassination of JFK.. I haven't read it yet but you might wanna check that out once.. And most important of all is not what you used to time travel, but how well the plot is woven.. If the story is griping enough, then audience wouldn't care about how it's done.. Didn't you watch Chris Nolan's *Inception* film.. Nobody bothers about what that dream machine was all about but what they do there after entering into the dream realm... So, it depends not on what your character uses to time travel but what he does after time traveling that would interest some category of people, a category that readers like me belong to.

(I'm saving this post.. I would love to see others people's views on your question.) 




 I'm a guy who loves to read quotes on many things that interest me.. but when it came to quotes on 'Writing' I haven't come across many. It would be lovely if you guys can post your favourite quotes on *Writing* here. Thanks :)

I love this quote:

*"If there's a book that you want to read, but it hasn't been written yet, then you must write it."* -Toni Morrison 




 Yeah... and moreover the chemistry that a boyfriend and girlfriend should be having between them is completely missing between Harry and Hermione... They're just like any usual great male and female friends.. but such a chemistry was always there between Ron and Hermione. They just have it... I think this whole thing of Hermione and Harry came up just because Emma Watson is extremely beautiful and that we all have a knack for pairing up the best looking girl only with the main protagonist of a story and not with his best friend. 




 Ok.. Apparently I overreacted too! 

Thanks for the clarifying article link...  




 I hate to read about these plot twists...!! And I don't want to see Hermione paired with Harry... The way it is in the book is the best already.. Let's keep it that way.. Over and done.. Although I love J.K.Rowling I didn't like her coming out and telling that Dumbledore is gay and that she thought of killing Ron's character and now this one... I just don't like such stuff. This just ruined my Saturday. 














 Thanks, mate, for the encouragement :) 




 Recently I've started enjoying porn related stuff less and less with each passing day... It has started to seem mechanical. Also I'm not doing much in my other chosen goals of life as well. Now I felt like taking a break from porny stuff and come back here. I love masturbating, but now I'm not enjoying my PMO sessions much they've become monotonous. I guess that's because I've taken too much liberty. Now I'm gonna control my thoughts. 




 DEAR MODS.. ALSO WE SHOULD MIND THE LOOK AND FEEL OF THIS SUB. WE GOTTA CHANGE THE FUCKING BACKGROUND OF OUR SUB REGULARLY (LIKE [/R/INTERSTELLAR](http://www.reddit.com/r/interstellar/)).. WE SHOULD MAKE IT FEEL ALIVE..

ALSO IT IS TIME WE PUNCH THE THREE FACES STARING AT US FROM THE HEADER AND PUT MOTIVATIONAL QUOTES THERE INSTEAD... OR MAYBE THE QUOTES THAT ARE TAKEN FROM THE POSTS THAT WE HAVE HERE FROM OUR FELLOW BROTHERS.. 

ALSO LET'S CREATE A CATCHPHRASE EVERY MONTH AND LET THE BROTHERHOOD SPREAD THE WORD... SIMPLY WRITING POSTS WON'T BRING PEOPLE OR MAKE US FAMOUS. WE GOTTA REDEFINE OUR LIVING HERE.. WE GOTTA MAKE OUR LIFESTYLE FUCKING ADDICTIVE FOR OTHERS THAT THEY CAN'T RESIST US. THEY HAVE TO COME TO US ANTICIPATING A NERVE WRENCHING CHANGE IN THEIR GODDAMN LIVES.
 




 THE SURE SHOT WAY TO HAVE A COMPLETENESS IN YOUR EVERYDAY LIFE IS TO ALWAYS FUCKING DO SOMETHING.. EVERY SINGLE MOMENT. DONT SIT IDLE FOR MORE THAN 300 SECONDS AT A STRETCH. ALWAYS KEEP DOING SOMETHING. BE IT READING SOMETHING OR REMEMBERING A MATH TRICK YOU LEARNED A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO OR ANYTHING PRODUCTIVE FOR THAT MATTER.. BUT ALWAYS DO SOMETHING THAT TAKES YOU A STEP FORWARD ON YOUR DREAM PATH. IF NOTHING ELSE TURNS UP IN YOUR MIND, JUST SIT AND LISTEN TO YOUR BREATH... MEDITATE.

REALIZING YOUR POTENTIAL BY EXHAUSTING YOURSELF LIKE FUCK BY DOING THE STUFF THAT IS NECESSARY FOR YOU IN THE PURSUIT OF YOUR GODDAMN DREAM.. THAT IS WHAT IT MEANS TO BE FUCKING ALIVE. 

REMEMBER THIS EVERY GODDAMN MOMENT THAT YOU FEEL YOURE WASTING TIME. WHEN WE DO THIS WE CAN SLEEP PEACEFULLY. LET ME TELL YOU BROTHERS, A PEACEFUL SLEEP IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IS SEEN MUCH IN PEOPLE, RICH AND POOR ALIKE. TO SLEEP PEACEFULLY WITH A HAPPY MIND IS ONE OF THE BEST FUCKING THINGS IN LIFE. 

NOW, LET'S GO EXHAUST OURSELVES BY THE END OF EACH DAY AND SEE FOR OURSELVES WHAT A GREAT RELAXING SLEEP WE WILL HAVE EVERY NIGHT.
 




 POSTS GODDAMNIT.. WE NEED REGULAR POSTS TO FUCKING MAKE IT TO THE FRONT PAGE AND FUCKING STAY THERE. LET'S DO POSTS EVERYGODDAMNDAY.  WE NEED ATLEAST A 1000 UPVOTES EVERYDAY ON ATLEAST ONE SINGLE POST SO THAT IT WILL GET FUCKING NOTICED. BUT WE WON'T GET THOSE MANY UPVOTES UNTIL WE MAKE IT THERE AND BE FUCKING VISIBLE TO ALL.. OH WE'RE STRUCK IN A FUCKING DEADLOCK. 

BUT LET'S DO THIS. 




 This should make the front page.. 




  Crazy for sure

Nah.. Not much... 




 I liked Fahrenheit 451 better. 




 *I disliked 1984*.. Oh I can actually say that and not get arrested by Thought Police.. Thank you 1984 :) 




 HIS DARK MATERIALS, Book 1, Northern Lights has be in the North.. Expecting to enter a parallel universe. 




 Hey guys... a BIG thanks to all of you.. I've found really helpful suggestions from all of your comments... Thank you immensely for that. And I will put your help to best use. 

Thank you, all :) 




 This sounds really promising.. Will definitely give it a shot. Thank you :) 




  assuming you're American

No.. I'm from India. 




 You're right.. But I won't be solely writing about them but when I try to create a fantasy orientied story line or something it would be helpful to have this kind of knowledge...  




 Very informative. 




 I would like to have a basic knowledge on the world's history.. all that one would deem as important for a writer to know.. Can you please suggest me such books or documentaries that would give me a good bird's eye view on the world's/Mankind's history?? I want to know about wars, color/race discriminations and everything that's vital for my writing. Please suggest.. 




 I opened that link while listening to Interstellar OSTs...!!  




  woods

When somebody mentions that word the first thing that pops up in my mind is *Walden* by Henry David Thoreau. 




 I don't read any newspapers... and when I listen to or read various authors' views on global political things, as an aspiring writer I feel that I don't have any knowledge in writing fiction/non-fiction about such things. How do I help myself with this? 




  we need the books that affect us like a disaster, that grieve us deeply, like the death of someone we loved more than ourselves

I agree with the full quote, however it is not particularly necessary to read only those books that make you grieve.. It might be the case that you're already grieving about something in life and you want a book that casts upon your mind a new light of hope and euphoria. You need books that not only affect you like disaster, but also those that come to you with the relief aids and life support supplies.. for life is not just about loss but more importantly about loving and living. 




 Oh I had no idea of this before.. thank you so much... But now I'm afraid that War and Peace would be overflowing with these should I plan to pick it up sometime... Is it so? 














 These are the closing lines of The Martian:

The cost for my survival must have been hundreds of millions of dollars. All to save one dorky botanist. Why bother? 

Well, okay. I know the answer to that. Part of it might be what I represent: progress, science, and the interplanetary future weve dreamed of for centuries. But really, they did it because every human being has a basic instinct to help each other out. It might not seem that way sometimes, but its true. 

If a hiker gets lost in the mountains, people will coordinate a search. If a train crashes, people will line up to give blood. If an earthquake levels a city, people all over the world will send emergency supplies. This is so fundamentally human that its found in every culture without exception. Yes, there are assholes who just dont care, but theyre massively outnumbered by the people who do. And because of that, I had billions of people on my side. 




 as always, I upvote anything from Thoreau :) 









 and then there is the so called 'Docking scene'... of course 




 I recently read Andy Weir's novel *The Martian* and one of the things shown in the book, [the concern that the world shows towards the safety and survival of Mark Watney, which Mark reminisces at the end of the book while thinking about how the world has unitedly came forward to deal with the situation that is of global level](#s)... today when I was reading a newspaper article about Nepal Earthquake and about numerous countries coming forward with relief supplies and help to alleviate the plight of Nepal after the country faced a destructive earthquake on Saturday... Today I really felt with my heart what Mark Watney was meaning at the end of *The Martian.*

That is what defines us, the Mankind!
 




 Let me please ask you this: What kind of author is H.P. Lovecraft?? Can you please give me a breif in your opinion about his works?? 




  it's also about writing.

I'd love that... and need that too! 




 Stephen King is another person that I admire very much next to Asimov.. He writes like its a part of his respiration process. Truly amazing. 




 For me it has been Isaac Asimov.. Ever since I read *Opus 100* by Asimov I fell in love with the kind of life that he had - filled with knowledge and potential. I was stunned by the way he tried his hand at many, many great things that he wanted to write about. He was a true genius and I got to know that in his own words. I recently purchased his second autobiography *I, Asimov.* Looking forward to an amazing journey into Asimov's life and mind, yet again.

Do you guys also have any authors that you love to read when they write about themselves and their life?? 




 hey this one is very good too.. thank you so much.. 

(But I was surprised that in all the three pics I got from people the girl is moving objects vertically above her palms... I was thinking of her moving the objects that are at some distance, like TV remote or books in a shelf, a bottle from the fridge or something like that...)

But thank you so much for the efforts.. the sketch is very nice... actually she is looking more like a normal girl, which is what I wanted, and especially the expression on her face is very good, it almost suits the setting of my story. Thank you once again, friend :) 




 *Rendezvous With Rama* by Arthur C Clarke is a top notch sci-fi that's nothing about any war or destruction, it's completely about a new found planet in the space, called Rama.. I don't know about the rest of the 3 books in the RAMA series if war is involved in them. I don't think they do. 




 These both, Asimov and PKD are my most favourite ones in Sci-Fi :) 




 ;) ;) 




 I've currently set out to do lot of things in life, but everyday I tend to fail at focusing my mind on the actions necessary for those things.. I'm also an aspiring writer, so I was thinking in a metaphorical sense about my failed efforts to tame my mind.. and then I came with the sentence: *"Mind is the wildest horse."*

It would be awesome if somebody can try drawing that. Thank you :) 









 yeah.. this one is fine too... thanks... but can the object be a bit far from her...?? like she is standing at the window of her room and trying to move a book or something which is on a table on the other side of the room... something like that... 




 anything and everything is warmly welcome... :) 




 That's a very interesting one.. Thank you buddy :) 




 Thanks.. I hope so too :) 




 I'm an aspiring writer.. and art inspires me to write better because looking at it makes me think better and deeper. Right now I'm trying to pen a short story about a girl who finds out that she has telekinetic ability. (Wait, I know what you're thinking. I'm not ripping off Stephen King's Carrie. I'm just inspired from that book and want to try something different with the same superpower storyline. That's all.)

Can somebody please draw me some art depicting a girl discovering/performing telekinesis??

 Flipside by Adam J Jackson is a great read that you might want to consider. 




 I love Thoreau. 




 very interesting... which book..?? author? 




 a philosopher that he is.... 




 I was reading this book and I stumbled upon this sentence, and at once I realized something very connecting to our everyday lives. We all often think of doing great things, and in such instances when we decide to take up something new in life we actually feel better and uplifted. This sentence reflects that. 





























 [The Internet's Own Boy: The Story of Aaron Swartz](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3268458/?ref_=nv_sr_1) is a pretty moving documentary about this awesome dude's life and fight for making internet a better place. 




 great point. 




 This line is from Stephen King's *Carrie*. Isn't it? 




 A very good point indeed. 




 This hurts. 




 I strongly believe that in some specific instances, such as this one, we confuse *striving* with *suffering.* They both differ strongly if we look deep enough. 




 The source is [his speech at a commencement ceremony at Princeton University](http://gulfnews.com/leisure/movies/news/christopher-nolan-explains-inception-s-ending-1.1531119#.VXauYqRi5Qc.reddit) 




 What do you think of such a thing? 









 The best part about the trailer is that it opens with the closing lines of the book. That is some way to launch a trailer of this film. 




 That was fuckin kick-ass awesomeness! 




   like someone never moved by a work of fiction. 

Oh how unlucky that would be! 




 I always read the name of this author twice so as not to mistake it for Franz Kafka. 




 Thank you so much for pointing out.. Just bought his *The Global Warming Reader: A Century of Writing About Climate Change*  




 Thanks for the encouragement.  




 Sounds pretty straight forward. Will do. Thanks. 




 That's a great advice. Thanks. 




 I'm an aspiring novelist. But sometimes I just can't overlook the beauty of language that is presented in freeverse poetic pieces. I recently read Mary Oliver's *House of Light* and rejoiced a great deal of wordly beauty that those pages presented. And Tagore's *Gitanjali* is my all time favourite.

I too write some freeverse now and then, and also I was told by a few friendds of mine that I write short poetic stuff better than I write the regular blogs.

And also on Tumblr I sometimes witness beautiful stuff written by random people around the world. A recent one that I found and became a fan of is Jamie Oliveira. Her [cosmicroots](http://cosmicroots.tumblr.com) blog was splendid. Some of her works were simply sour stirring for me.

Experiencing all this beauty of language and words in shortly woven pieces, these days I'm tending to try out freeverse writing myself. 

What do you think are some of the ways in which I can improve my freeverse writing? 




 Undoubtedly, Kindle Paperwhite. 









 That's good too..  




 Thanks for the response.. 




 What are the best books on the subjects of Global Warming and Environmental Protection? 




 Thank you so much...  




 Recently I found out that I'm developing a concern for the wellness of our planet, its greenery, and above all, for the threat that we're impending upon our home in the form of heat and Global Warming.

What are some of the best books that you've read on this subject?
 









 and credited it to who? 




 very cool. 









 Movies and books...  




 Being God. 




 From a recent news I came to know that over [1100 people died](http://edition.cnn.com/2015/05/25/asia/india-heatwave-deaths/) in my country (India) due to the summer heat. Most of them poor people.

This made me wonder what would be the case of the future generations in the years to come. 

Now, I want to know of all the ways (even the smallest) on how to help the planet. 




 Just received my copy of *Leaves of Grass.* 









 Inception and Interstellar vary only by a slight fractional difference in terms of my favouriteness. 




  he story itself relies on hints and implications that the reader has to pick up by themselves.

TIL that I just suck at it :( 




  Potassium cyanide gives off a faint but distinctive "bitter almond" smell/taste,

Oh now readers need to know chemistry, huh! Dahl dude.. That's not why I pick up your books - for getting lost on the point in the story that involves chemistry. 




 What the hell :O
Why.. why would Roald Dahl, a person who wrote *Matilda*, would come up with something like that. :'( 




 The recent one *The Martian* by Andy Weir is a pretty awesome sci-fi book. 




  I used to be the obnoxious girl who would correct everyone's grammar and spelling. When reading aloud in classes, it made me crazy when people couldn't pronounce words.

That's Hermione right there :) 




  just practice.

I like that trick..  




 Yeah, Math when properly understood can be real fun.. I want to see that fun. 




 I've a point to try it :) 




 hey thanks for reminding about this. 




 Math is something we all need in our daily lives. It is only obvious for everyone to be wanting to become good at it. What are the ways that helped you pick up Math in easy and interesting manner? 




 That's like a Potterhead.. Kudos to both! 




 I picked up his short stories collection volume 1. Just finished the first story *The Landlady* and it ended abruptly when Weaver was trying to remember somthing about the two names listed in the guest book of the hotel. And why did landlady tried to interrupt him when he was trying to remember how he found those two names familiar??

I'm an aspiring author, so it is important for me to understand what I'm reading in depth. 

What was Roald Dahl trying to say in the story?
 




 That was beautiful. 




 *Paradise Lost* is a free verse?? I didn't know that.. But yeah I agree that it has some of breathtaking lines ever written in English language. 




 I added *Leaves of Grass (Enriched Classics) Mass Market Paperback  Special Edition, 1 Aug 2006* into my cart. Is that a fine one or should I go for someother? 

EDIT: Sorry had to remove the Amazon link. I mentioned the edition. 




  Leaves of grass deserves a mention since Whitman is considered the father of free verse.

Oh what a beautiful concidence.. I just added *Leaves of Grass* to my amazon cart a while ago :) 




 *The Alchemist* is a great life changing book in my life.. Everytime someone asks me to suggest them a good book, this is what I tell them about. 




 Just now I finished Mary Oliver's poetry (free verse) book, *House of Light*. It was a very pleasing read. It has some great touching lines:

*"There are many stories, more beautiful than answers."*

*"She does not work slowly, nor quickly, like a river."*

*"Its not size but surge that tells us when were in touch with something real."*

*"If the world were only pain and logic, who would want it?"*

*"Fear has not yet occurred to them, nor ambition."*

and my most favourite:

*"This is not a poem about a dream, though it could be.*

*This is a poem about the world that is ours, or could be."*


and many many more...

Now, I'm thinking of picking of Shelley's poetry soon. I just broswed a book or two of his and they appeared to be very promising free verses.

What are your favourite free verse poetry books?? 









 Last year, I picked up *Flatland* by Edwin A. Abott. I was thrilled by the mind-bendingly written lifestyle of the 2D geometrical figures. I absolutely loved the genius creativity that was put into that book.

What are some of your favourite books that are an epitome of creative genius in writing? 




 I always felt that Voldemort was a good collector of stuff. 




 B.E.A.Utiful! 




 actaully it's a great relief to hear that. 




 From her poem [*Little Owl Who Lives in the Orchard*](http://www.poetryconnection.net/poets/Mary_Oliver/17296) 




 I like gifting books. A friend of mine is quitting his job to start his own entrepreneurial venture. He likes astronomy. Yesterday, I presented him *Cosmos* by Carl Sagan as a parting gift. 




  I think many of the people recommending them as life-changing are folks who aren't heavy readers or previously thought of reading as dull and are simply surprised and excited to find books that move at a quick pace and include a lot of action and twists. 

You just killed me man. 




  His fight meant nothing. Human life. 

I'm more of an optimistic person.. Human life doesn't necessarily mean sadness and dissatisfaction.. Well, human life is better than fishing. That much I can say. 




 I second you! 




 1984. 




 Oh how surrealistic! 




 I once read a selection of paragraphs by Paulo Coelho. Among them there was a selection from *Lady Chatterley's Lover.* I absolutely loved the description.. it was very feelable. I recently bought the book to read it completely.

What are your favourite books with sexual descriptions? And among them are there any books that deal with *sex* in a spiritual perspective? 




 Thank you so very much sir :) :) 




 By the way, can you please tell me the name of that essays collection by Chuck Palahniuk??? I searched but didn't find. 




 One face with different shades everyday. 




 Harry Potter. Those 7 books are at the core of my heart and the way my morality in life is shaped. What else is so important for a person than his morale! Albus Dumbledore has taught me to always be humble no matter how powerful you become, and Harry taught me it is good to stay down to earth even if you're the most important person to many. Hagrid had taught me trust. The trio themselves had taught me the value of friendship... And above all, the Harry Potter series by J.K.Rowling has showed me that life can be magical and illuminating if one only remember to turn on the light. I'm indebted forever to Rowling. 




 I will look into them for sure. In fact, an article by Chuck had once immensely helped me understand the *show, don't tell* rule of writers.. So, I'm sure more material from him would definitely be helpful. 




 Oh no apologies, pal.. Welcome to Reddit.. It's one of the awesomest places on the internet.. You might wanna check out /r/destructivereaders and many other subs that deal with lots of interesting things... Front Page is awesome place to find some great stuff.. There is a sub for almost everything you can think of.. almost.  Explore and enjoy... 




 Hey thank you so much for the response :) :) 




  The thing I enjoy writing the most is dialogue

Looks like you love to write in dialogue.. Please teach us some tips here.. no seriously.. helps people like me who suffer to write dialogue.. 

I'm not native to English so most of my dialogues sound pretentious.. How to deal with that?? 
(Any suggestions from anybody would be pretty helpful. Thanks.) 




 Hey pal.. you gotta post this in the text box.. not in the comments section, so that it accompanies your post. 




  would like advice on what to do with this.

Write another one.

 My friend said to find a website that I can post on and create a sort of portfolio on, but I don't know if that is a good idea.

That is. 




 "All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others." -George Orwell, Animal Farm 









 Oh my god.. this is one of the best quotes I've ever read in my entire life..  




 That's the question on which this entire sub is founded in the first place. Find the answer by yourself if you're interested, buddy. 




 Hey buddy.. looks like you need a bit of /r/allcapsmotivation
CHECK THAT OUT AND FUCKING KICK THE ASS OUT OF YOUR GODDAMN LIFE. 




 Yes.. Agree.. Sometimes when I observe that I'm putting too much time in computer than into reading I just shut down all of it for a couple of days and just read... It's so satisfying feeling. 




 Thank you so much for pointing out.. If you fortunately find such links please try taking a minute out and commenting them here in this post if you can. Thanks. 




 Hey, thanks.. This kind of comments is exactly what I made this post for. 




  There are theories like the many worlds/multiverse theory where consciousness can sort of "jump" from one timeline to another causing memory discrepancies (or the "Mandela Effect"), but thats really just a fun guess.

I believe in all that shit.. It helps me cope up with this world's reality knowing that somewhere out there is another universe where I am achieving everything that I wanted to. So soothing! 




 No.. I'm asking to point out the interesting phenomenons that are discussed here in this sub, phenomenons like *the Mandela Effect.* That is all I'm asking. 




 I've recently seen a post here that talked of Mandela Effect. Till that moment I've never heard of such an effect. When I learned about it, I felt thrilled and amazed at the same time. I'm an aspiring writer and now I want to know about these Glitch-causers. So, I request you all to please post in the comments some of the 'effects' (like Mandela Effect) that are discussed frequently in this sub.

Thank you :)
 




 Something tells me I need to save this post. 




 Harry Potter series. 




 Thanks for the idea... :) 




 Mark Wattney's sense of humour is the best thing about the book. 




 Wow.. This one is very good.. Fits well with my lines.. Thank you so much :) 
I would love to see your work on the other samples in there as well, in case if you try them too. Thanks, again.

**EDIT:** I've shown this artwork to some of my friends and they really liked it very much. And also the more I look at it the more I feel amazed. Thank you so much for the splendid work. 




 THANK YOU FOR THE RESPONSE.. AND BROTHER, YOUR COMMENT SHOULD'VE BEEN IN CAPS.. BECAUSE THIS IS GODDAMN [/R/ALLCAPSMOTIVATION](http://www.reddit.com/r/allcapsmotivation/) 









 Just saw the drawing session post... really looking forward for responses.. Thank you so much once again. 




 I don't do anything. I just sit and listen to the book. I listen to audiobooks mostly when I feel like finishing more books in less time. Becaue I don't read fast.. so audiobooks are really a way for me to 'read more' in less time.. And also, when it comes to Malcolm Gladwell's books, I only listen to his audiobooks.. I like his narrating voice so much that I don't get the similar kick when I read his books by myself. 




 The light that comes out of screen when everywhere around you is pitchblack might actually harm your eyes and lead to headache. I use Kindle Paperwhite where I can regulate the light emission.. and ofcourse kindles are designed particularly for reading, so they've actually considered all of that eye sight thing.. If you're talking about reading on tablets and mobiles I would suggest to keep the light at the minimum so as not to affect your eyes. That is all. 




 Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell, and Words from the Myths by Isaac Asimov, and Into The Wild by Jon Krakauer, and Walden by Henry David Thoreau 




 This is a good idea.. we also need something like /r/artbuddy for writing.. Is there one? 




 It sounds like a great idea.. thank you so much for the support...

*Angel looked at the bird dancing beside her with its beautiful feathers open, and wondered how it feels to be a peacock.*

 None. Because nothing is going to be close to it. Atleast not in a few years to come. 




 Interstellar posters with that bookshelf are always intriguing.. I love it. Personally as a lover of books I feel it a tribute by Chris Nolan the way he used that bookshelf in the plot. 




   i also wondered what in the world people were always doing that was driving him nuts; no cell phones, no tv, no computers, no automobiles.

Oh I never thought of that.. And so I could relate to it in the present day life... You raised an interesting point.

  Into The Wild

It's a life defining book for me as well... along with *Walden* by Henry David Thoreau
 




  The Old Man and the Sea.

I thanked god when the book was finished.. Seriously, what a godforsaken boring book it is! 




 Hey can you please share the names of those three books?? 




 Franz Kafka's *Meta-fucking-Morphosis.* I mean, seriously, what *is* that book??? 




 YEAH. NO DOUBT IT IS. WHEN I READ IT FOR THE FIRST TIME, I COULD THINK OF NOTHING FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS OTHER THAN THEIR NERVE WRENCHING COMMITMENT LEVELS. IT SCARED THE SHIT OUT OF ME WHEN I IMAGINED MYSELF IN THEIR SHOES. THOSE MONKS ARE ONE OF THE BEST ASS-KICKING AVENGERS I'VE EVER HEARD OF IN MY LIFE. 




  I loved Animal Farm.

Animal Farm is my actual favourite classic. 




 Yeah.. reading and music sometimes go together like [dick and pussy!](#s) 




 Yeah seriously.. That 'book inside a book' thing... it was literally the most dragging part of the entire thing.

At the beginning of the novel when the concepts such as *Thought Police* were being narrated, it was really interesting. And 1984 being a famous sci-fi novel (which it is goddamn definitely not), I was expecting something of a Hollywood level plot twist.. and then facepalm :/ 




  Couldn't finish it. It was so dry and flavorless. 

 I mean, no offense. It's popular for a reason. I just couldn't stand it. I feel like dystopian is just too overplayed now and I've seen it all before.

High five! 




 It took a while for mymind to register what I was looking at, but when I did.. *Oh Boy! It was spectacularly designed.* 




  In two days, I read three books! 

I'd love to accomplish such a thing.

 I cleaned my room, and it looks amazing. Just like my soul.

Dude that's a nailing sentence.

 Could this all be a placebo?

No. It's will power, brother.
 




 Maybe I didn't like the book because I tend to dislike dystopian novels...  The ideas in them are good than their execution IMO. 




 1984 (I know I'm gonna be downvoted for this comment. But truth be told.. I felt glad when the book ended and I could finally put it aside.) 




 THANK YOU, BROTHER. 
























 What a candid title! 




 What types of writing do you do? Short stories? Poems? Novellas? 




 Watch the film [Finding Forrester](https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/3b7xg9/guys_dont_miss_the_film_finding_forrester_i_just/). 




 I practice by writing short stuff such as freeverse paragraphs and poems, flash fiction, short stories and quotes.

* [Freeverse paragraphs and poems](https://medium.com/word-dust) help me to explore the beauty of language.
* Flash fiction helps me in sharpening the skill of developing an engaging fictional pieces.
*  Short stories challenge me to shape a story that has the main elements of storytelling, such as conflict, purpose, character and etc.
* Quotes help me to understand myself better. They act as self-advices. 

These are the ways in which I practice my writing. In what ways do you practice yours?
 




 [Shiva Trilogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Immortals_of_Meluha) by Amish Tripati. He is the recent Indian literary revolution, after Chetan Bhagat. 




 Pretty awesome painting bro.... IF the same would've been drawn by a great painter, it would worth millions. It's that good IMO. I would suggest you to give it a name. 




 He quietly nailed it. 




 But you need this Polish proverb to realize that you need no accuser. 




 No wonder Tagore has won a Nobel in Literature. 




 What all of his have you read? 




 Heard of it quite a lot. But the length of the novel is making me hesitate. I'm yet to get into mainsteam large classics. That's why I started with short ones. Will surely read it but not in a while. That and also *East of Eden.* 




 Ever since I read Gitanjali by Tagore I understood the potential of writers who win Nobels in Literature. So, from then on every now and then I pick up something written by Nobel laureates. As of now I've read:

* Tagore (Gitanjali)
* Herman Hesse (Siddhartha; Steppenwolf)
* Ernst Hemingway (The Old Man and the Sea)
* John Steinbeck (Of Mice and Men; The Pearl)

I realized that I prefer short novels of such people which gives a glimpse of the kind of work they do and the type of stories they tell. 

From the above list, only Ernest Hemingway's book *The Old Man and the Sea* bored me badly (sorry, fans). Rest of them were somewhere between good to great reads. 

What are your favourite (preferrably short) works from Nobel winners in literature? 




 An upvote to anything that comes from Thoreau. Anyday. 




   people who have not yet had a chance to start existing,

I like the way you put it.

Apart from that I can't offer you any help here because I'm as confused as you are, if not more. Sorry. 




 OH MY GOD.. It's one of the best covers ever designed. No kidding. Never thought one can put so much sense of humour into a book cover.

EDIT: Too bad it's not available for purchase now :( 
Can you suggest me a way that I can get this edition? (I'm from India) 




 Yeah neither did I ever read James Bond books.. but I too liked those covers. They're true to the Bond-ness. 




 Hey, Medium is an awesome place to blog up stuff.. And your Collection (now called Publication?) *On Literature* was pretty good one.. Especially I liked the 9 covers of Moby Dick even more.
Thank you for sharing here :)) Keep collecting awesome book covers. 




 Oh that cover was poetic, nothing less! 




 Hey that's a beautiful piece of art... pencil sketch I suppose?? 









 Oh Yes... With Harry and Dumbledore standing amidst the red yellow swirling fire.. oh God that was a fantastic thing :)))

EDIT: [This is what I was referring to, and also the newly published editions with looks similar but more graphic and intense.](http://harrypotterfanzone.com/wp-content/2009/06/hbp-uk-kids-jacket-art.jpg) 




 Wow.. that spine art is beautiful, man :) 




 Just found a resource of enthralling book covers. An archive that is filled of only them :D
http://blog.bookcoverarchive.com/
 




 OK, talking of book covers, I just found about this [TED talk.](http://www.ted.com/talks/chip_kidd_designing_books_is_no_laughing_matter_ok_it_is) 




 That's a pretty great to design a cover like that especially for 1984. 




 The cover is truly splendid. I will read this book. Thank you so much for sharing it here :)) 

(This is precisely the purpose of this post: to explore, find and pick up new books inspired by their wondrously designed covers.) 




 Thanks... I bought this book last year. Looking at your comment, I just now picked it to read soon. 




 I just finished reading 'The Subtle Knife' (the second book in the HIS DARK MATERIALS trilogy by Philip Pullman) and I collected these two awesome bookcovers: http://imgur.com/gallery/3qlpX/new

What are your favourite book covers? Please do share if you have the pictures. It would be pretty exciting to know about new books in this way. Thanks :) 




 Now, this is what I call a classic nature gif. 




 Dude, that shit was so repelling to look at. 




 EDIT: I don't know why the post is being downvoted.. Can't we just discuss a movie about *writing* or what?? 




 And also:

 "'I wish I had seen this, or I wish I had done that, or I wish..." 
Most of you are too young to know what your wishes will be. But when I read these words words of hope, dreams, I realise that the one wish that was granted to me, so late in life was the gift of friendship. 




  Especially the end speech.

Yes.. the way it starts, man.. what beautiful words!!! :)))

I only managed to find these:

Losing family... obliges us to find our family. Not always the family that is our blood, but the family that can became our blood. And should we have the wisdom to open our door to this new family...we will find that the wishes and hopes we once had...for the father who once guided us, for the brother who once inspired us...those wishes are there for us once again. 




 and also this line that Jamal types on the typewriter: 

*through that dark tunnel. To me it is as beautiful as a deep black night.*  




  what I would pay to read the finished works in that movie.

Yeah seriously. What a beauty of words they contained in them! They're awesome. If only they're available for real... 









 Would you please like to share the blog link here if you don't mind?? :) 




 Hey, the quoted excerpt from your blog is pretty awesome. It's as good as a non-fiction piece. And also thank you so much for the other suggestions as well :))) 









 Hey, The Moth looks very interesting and helpful. Thank you so very much :))) 




 Yes. Thank you so much :)))) 




 Hey thanks a lot :)))))  




 My friend just mentioned today a play from his childhood that he read in a book then. He is trying to remember it now. I told him I will try finding it. Please read the below text (a summary of the play) and suggest the title of the play or the book if you know it. PLEASE.

"an excerpt from a play about a man who has broken with his fiancee and leaves her flat angrily but forgets his hat he is too proud to travel without his hat but doesn't want to go back in her apartment so he tries to bribe peopleinto going in her flat and get the hat for him it is hilarious as he encounters a clerk, a poet, a cop etc i just wish to find it and read again"

Thanks, guys.
 




 Thanks, mod :) Trying them too.

 ~ said no one ever. 




 then is [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/QuotesPorn/comments/3anljr/please_pay_attention_very_carefully_because_this/) fakely credited? 














 I will be very happy to have your answer.. Please do come back :) 




 Thank you so very much for the response. The suggestions you gave sounds promising. I will try to incorporate them into my daily life to develop the skill of storytelling. Thank you so much once again :) 









 'save' button deserves this post. 




  Because of this, I think that an author's level of accomplishment often lies in their capacity for empathy. It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who has experienced something that you haven't, but being able to understand their experience (or try to at least) is an invaluable skill.

Spoken like a true genius that you are. 




  Something Wicked This Way Comes

I think I'm going to pick that one up soon. 




 I'm an aspiring writer. And I also want to develop my storytelling skills. By 'storytelling' I mean actually telling them, not just in text but in voice, by speaking it out, by narrating it. 

I'm sure many of you guys are not only great writers of stories but also engaging tellers of those stories. I sincerely believe that there is a fine bit of difference between writing a story and telling it out for others. The biggest difference that I can argue about is that a written story is usually for people who read, and there are many, many people around the world who don't read (novels and such) but I'm sure no one is possibly averse to listening to a great story that's being told to them. (I also think this is a reason that makes movies differ from books, in a way.)

Please help me by giving some suggestions on:

* how to develop this skill 
* what kind of story suits better to be told than to write (if)
* what body language affects people in storytelling process
* how to engage your audience better when you're telling them a story

and anything else that you think would be important for a good story teller.

I'm really counting on this as it's very important for what I'm trying to do.

Thank you so much, guys. You're awesome :) 




 Just incase you didn't see [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/3au4qq/dammit_dammit_dammit/) already. 




 A church in shock. 




 From his [commencement speech.](http://www.brainpickings.org/2015/06/23/john-waters-risd-commencement-transcript/) 




  Might finish it someday

I end up falling into such situation sometimes.. Well, all the best to you too :) 




 Music helps a lot, and ofcourse also its accompanying lyrics. Photograhs. Paintings... and emotions mostly. 




 I love Neil Gaiman. 




  If there was a way then I would send you my copy.

Thank you so much for saying that. I would love to have it from a fellow booklover like you :)  




 Yes. Have to agree.. Awesome title that is. 




  Loaned

Yeah that's a completely valid one. It means: *Give temporarily; let have for a limited time* 




   lent (leant? Lended?)

You used it correctly. 'lent' is the only correct usage here (and also there is no 'lended').  




 Yes. Cloud Atlas is also something that I want to read it. I liked the cover that has 6 squares on it, but now it is not available in my country (India). The only edition that I could see online is the one with the film poster on it. :/ 




 A recent book whose title is attracting me so much is *All the Light We Cannot See* by Anthony Doerr 




 I don't do that very much although I buy lots of books when they're available at good prices. I keep them for future reading. But I've a childhood friend of mine who likes very much to shop books but never reads much of them at all. I also think that my friend never actually finished any single book in his life.  




 Yeah I too tend to do this sometimes. 




 I'm so happy about this, sir :D 




 awesome background... 




 thanks for this one... I need this. 









  Stephen King's private jet.

TIL that Stephen King has a private jet. 




 woah dude! 




 Nice insight. 




 Ever since I watched films like *Inception*, *Memento*, and recently *Interstellar* I too was wondering how to show such a non-linearity in writing.  









 Thoreau is a remarkable milestone of a person in my life. His *Walden* has changed my life forever. No kidding. 




 Those lines were awesome...  




 DO THE SHIT BRO. DO THE SHIT THAT GETS YOU SOMEWHERE IN LIFE. EVERY GODDAMN MORNING WE WAKE UP AND GO AHEAD LIVING THE SAME LIFE IN THE SAME MISERABLE FUCKING WAY. WE GOT TO TAKE THAT SHIT AND BEND IT AND SHOVE SOMETHING UP ITS ASS SO THAT IT KNOWS WE'RE NOT ITS TITTIES. 

WAKE THE FUCKING UP IN THE MORNING BRO AND GET THE SHIT RIGHT FOR THE ENTIRE DAY. PLAN THE DAY AHEAD AND FUCKING STICK WITH IT BRO. THAT WORKED FOR ME WHEN I WAS IN GREAT OF IT. HOPE IT HELPS YOU TOO. JUST TRY IT OUT.

STARTING AN ONLINE BUSINESS IS A PRETTY FUCKING COOL ENTREPRENEURSHIP VENTURE. LIVE UP TO IT. I HOPE YOU WILL FIND ALL THAT IS NEEDED FOR IT TO GET UP AND RUN.

KEEP DOING GREAT THINGS BRO. EVEN IF YOU FAIL TO do MANY DO JUST AS MUCH. 




 I'M 25 AND VERY AMBITIOUS AND ASPIRING. BUT THE THINGS THAT I'M DOING IN MY LIFE RIGHT NOW ARE NOT IN FUCKING UNISON WITH ANYTHING. THAT'S THE BIGGEST MOTHERFUCKING PROBLEM I'M FACING RIGHT NOW. I'M FIGHTING WITH MYSELF. I MUST. 

I WASTE A HELL LOT OF FUCKING TIME BY GETTING LOST IN A BUZZ OF THOUGHTS IN MY MIND THAT KEEPS MY FROM WORKING TOWARDS MY LIFE'S CONCERNS. I REALIZED THAT IT IS MY FUCKING PROBLEM. THE BUZZ. I SHOULD CONTROL IT. FUCKING TIE IT DOWN BY ITS NECK AND HANG IT TO DEATH. SO THAT IT WON'T TROUBLE ME IN ACHIEVING MY CONCERNS.

I HAVE THE FOLLOWING CONCERNS FOR MY BEAUTIFUL LIFE. THESE ARE ALL THE THINGS THAT MY HEART ALWAYS WANTS, AND THAT DIRECTLY AFFECT MY LIFE. I WANT TO DEDICATE THE NEXT FEW YEARS OF MY LIFE COMPLETELY TO THESE THINGS BY ABANDONING EVERYTHING ELSE THAT IS PETTY.

* **MBA ENTRANCE EXAM**- AIMING FOR SOME PREMIER INSTITUTES
* **JOB** - TO DO WELL IN THE CURRENT ONE AND LEARN GOOD DEAL OF SKILLS
* **READING BOOKS** - I NEED THIS BECAUSE I'M AN ASPIRING WRITER
* **WRITING** - OH THIS IS AFTER ALL MY LIFE'S WHOLE POINT AND PURPOSE. I GOTTA WRITE. FICTION. NON-FICTION. POETRY. SHORT STORIES. I JUST WANT TO WANDER AND FLY AND DIVE IN THE WORLD OF WORDS.

WHAT ARE YOUR CONCERNS IN LIFE, BROTHERS, AND WHAT IS IT THAT'S STOPPING YOU IN THE JOURNEY? LET'S TALK TO ONE ANOTHER ABOUT THEM. 




 I'm from India.. Heard that they're not going to come out here in a long long while :( 




  It's just as good as the real thing.

That's very encouraging actually. Thanks, buddy. 




 My favourite bad book covers are those novels that have real photographs on them for covers. They just repel me. 




 Harry Potter series. 




 Sorry for coming out as harsh in my comment. I didn't mean that at all. The story ended so well in the sense of plot and writing. No doubt about that.  




 No. I didn't think like that. 




   I never saw Interstellar in a real theatre

Oh oh oh buddy! I can't tell you how sorry we all are to hear this. 




  This film needs IMAX.

*IMAX* needs this film. 




 After the movie was finished I just kept reciting the F-word many, many times for myself, out of pure inexplicable awe of the story and the places it took me as an aspiring writer. 




  we sold the house to a young couple who yanked out the pole and the sticks and left them by the road on garbage day. 

This sentence should've been written in a new line. It seemed a bit too continuous with its previous line. Apart from that the story is hauntingly deep. Thanks for sharing. 




 :/ 




 I'm stunned. 




  I didn't really enjoy the book

Oh... Sorry to hear that. 




 That exact cover was the reason I didn't buy the book and preferred to read it on my Kindle. I mean, who comes up with such a shitty cover replacing the awesome one?? 




 I'm reading only 11th and 12th books of the year right now:

* The Subtle Knife by Philip Pullman
* David and Goliath by Malcolm Gladwell

I really got to pick up more books soon. 




 **Can somebody please suggest me some short story collections in the *quantum fiction* genre?** 









 I NEED TO HEAR THIS SHIT, BROTHER. THANK YOU. 




 They are. 




 I WOKE UP EARLY MORNING AT 5AM AND STUDIED FOR A LITTLE WHILE. ONLY FOR A FUCKING LITTLE WHILE. AND THEN AT 7AM I HAD TO TAKE AN ONLINE MOCKTEST FOR AN EXAM I'M PREPARING. THE TEST WAS OF NEARLY 3 HOURS. I REALLY FELT THAT I PERFORMED WELL IN ONE SECTION OF THE TEST. SO, I WAS LOOKING FORWARD FOR THE RESULTS. BUT WHEN I SUBMITTED MY TEST, THE GODDAMN SERVER FAILED. IT FUCKING FAILED. AND LIKE THAT BEGAN MY ONE OF THE MOST DISAPPOINTING WEEKENDS IN THE RECENT TIMES.

AT 12PM I WENT TO THE COACHING CLASSES THAT I ENROLLED INTO FOR THE EXAM PREP. AND SLOWLY AFTER A COUPLE OF HOURS OF CLASS I STARTED FEELING SLEEPY (BECAUSE I WASN'T HAVING ENOUGH SLEEP OVER THE WEEK DUE TO WORK AND STUFF LIKE THAT). AFTER 2PM A NEW CLASS HAS STARTED WHERE AN IMPORTANT MATH TOPIC WAS GOING ON 'PERMUTATIONS   COMBINATIONS.' AND I WAS HARDLY ABLE TO KEEP MY EYES OPEN DUE TO THE GODDAMN DROWSINESS. BY TRYING TO KEEP MYSELF FROM SLEEP IN THE CLASS, I STARTED TO GET HEADACHE. AND LIKE THAT I LOST THE ENTIRE LECTURE AND I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING.

FIRST THE TEST'S SERVER PROBLEM WHICH LOST ME MY PERFORMANCE CHECK. AND THEN BEING A SLEEPYFUCKINGHEAD PISSED ME OFF SO MUCH.

ALSO RECENTLY MANY THINGS IN MY LIFE RIGHT NOW ARE GOING BAD. MOSTLY THIS EXAM THING. MAN, I'M SO NOT DOING JUSTICE TO IT. 




 A linguistics professor says during a lecture that, In English, a double negative forms a positive. But in some languages, such as Russian, a double negative is still a negative. However, in no language in the world can a double positive form a negative.
But then a voice from the back of the room piped up, Yeah, right. 




 *The Alchemist* by Paulo Coelho. This book has been a great life changer for me. The concepts that it dealt with, such as *following your dreams* and *reading omens,* have become a crucial part of my life ever since. So, I just want to pass on the word. 









 I don't know.. I just thought this is an interesting idea that I stumbled on the internet today.. so posted it here.  









 Which is why you need to wield it with great force. 




 Ok. So, becoming wise can be depressing. 




 And not on Reddit so much.. I mean, it keeps coming up here so much that if you're a skinny guy you wonder if you're useless in life. 









 Maybe the part of his heart that deals with the human loss doesn't let him be just because he saved her kid.  




 Looking at all these insightful posts that carry a perspective from my most loved book series in my life I strongly feel that I need to give them multiple rereads to understand them this well. Thanks :) 




 Good, one :D 




 What a deep insight! 




   this, almost perfectly.

I strongly believe that comma is not necessary there. 




 To me this shot seemed like a satire on the Mankind. We fight one another no matter what world we live in. 




 BATMAN 




  I wonder why he's not at Reddit anymore...

Dude. He died on Jan 11th, 2013. He hanged himself at last in the fight for internet freedom. 




 Oh sorry. There is a similar line from his *Carrie* as well. I just mistook it. Thanks for the clarification.
