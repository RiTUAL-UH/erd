 I agree about microwave popcorn ripping people off, I just went for a little bit of ease here. Also, even microwave popcorn is fairly inexpensive. 
























 **I Hate Camping**

I get asked a lot, you know. Its weird, you wouldnt think its that common of a question. But I hear it from family, from my co-workers, hell, even from a few of my friends. 

Hey, wanna go camping some time?

I try not to be rude. I say:

No thanks, Im not a big fan of camping. Too many bugs.

I can usually stand the bugs, to be honest. And saying that Im not that big a fan of camping is an understatement, because the thought of camping, spending the night in a tent in the wilderness away from roads and buildings and electricity  well it sounds pretty shitty. I hate camping.

I try not to think about the last time I went camping. But the other day a coworker, Zack, brought it up to me. He said:

Im thinking of planning a big fishing trip weekend after next in Deckers! Calvin and Will said theyd be down. You in?

Umm. Maybe Where would we stay? (Deckers, a small town about a hundred miles into the Rockies, wasnt known for its selection of hotels)

Zack told me: Well, I was assuming wed just camp right beside the river. Bought a brand new tent after our bonuses came in-

No thanks! I interrupted. Im not really much of a camper.

I started to turn away, but Zack put a hand on my shoulder  Hey, whats wrong? Did I say something?

Its nothing, I just dont like to go camping. Too many bugs. I hadnt expected him to push, I was getting a little nervous.

I dont think its the bugs. Zack insisted. He was determined.

Its the bugs, I promise. I offered.

Bullshit. When we had the fire-ant problem in the break room, and you werent phased at all by that shit. Whats your problem with camping?

That was all it took. I broke down. Starting crying. Zack was startled and visibly regretful hed even asked. He started apologizing to me -
Shit man, Im sorry. I didnt think it was a big deal. Listen, if I said something-

Its wasnt you. I spoke, stifling back tears. I just I hate camping.

Zacks a good guy. But, he was curious about what I said, and I cant really blame him. 

Why? What happened? 

I told him what happened. Not then, I was still pretty choked up. We went to a bar that night, after work. We ordered a round of beers, and I told Zack the story of my last camping trip. I told him why I hate camping.

--------------------------

I was 18. It was early August of 06. It must have been 2006 cause thats the year I finished my last year of high school. Just east of the Rockies, its still warm that time of year. I had about 2 weeks left before I left home to go off to college. That was kind of rough, Id lived in the same neighborhood and had the same friends all of my life - I wasnt excited to say good bye to them.

Honestly, it had been a rough summer. I was stressed preparing to go off to school, I was sad to leave my friends behind, and on top of all of that, my high school sweetheart, Sarah, cheated on me sometime near the end of July. We broke up.

That probably doesnt seem relevant, and maybe it isnt, but what is relevant is how it affected me. See, I wasnt really myself that week. I was kind of floating through life, spaced-out. In my own little world. I was spending my dwindling free time wandering the old suburban neighborhood Id grown up in, feeling sorry for myself. Mostly, I wandered alone.

But I had good friends back then, and sometimes they wandered with me. My best friend, his name was August, noticed that I was a broken shell of a human being. He wanted to help. He must of.

I think youre spending too much time here.. August was a short kid, but he was athletic and handsome. He thought he was an expert when it came to girl problems.

What do you mean? 

I mean that youre spending all of your time around all the places that you and Sarah used to go. I can see it getting to you. You should get away for the weekend. 

I grimaced  I cant spare the weekend. I driving up to Silverthorne Saturday night to see my older brother before I leave.

What about just Friday night? We could go camping.

We were driving somewhere, I think, while we were talking. I dont remember where, but that isnt important. The only reason Im sure that we were driving is because I remember swerving a little when he suggested it. I guess I was never much of a camper.

I havent been camping since we were in boy scouts. 

Itd be good for you man! We could get everybody to go. Itd be a good last hurrah, ya know?

So we went camping. Not all of our friends could get permission from their parents to go, but some did. There were seven of us. It was August and I, two girls named Lyndsey and Morgan, a guy named Chris, and a couple  Matt and Dana. We left Friday afternoon. Well, thats not entirely true.

August, Lyndsey, Morgan, Chris, and I left Friday afternoon. Dana had work until 6pm, so she and Matt were going to drive up separately from us that evening. The campground we had chosen was a mountain trail about 50 miles west of where we lived. It wasnt that long a drive, but it was in the mountains, away from civilization, and most of all, you didnt have to pay to get in. The name of the campground was Rampart Range.

I spaced out pretty hard during the drive up. Everyone was going out of their way to cheer me up, but I was having trouble getting my mind completely clear. I read off the directions that wed printed from the Map Quest website so Morgan, who was driving, could get there, but I wasnt really aware of where we were going. I was still in my own little world. Maybe if I was a little more lucid, I would have reconsidered the trip in its entirety.

The five of us got to the trail at about 4pm. There were a bunch of different trails in Rampart Range, so we choose one near the entrance. Morgan parked the car and we climbed out onto dry grass. I groaned and stretched to get rid of the kinks that the drive had put in my neck. I looked around. There was a small trail that ran through some trees, about twenty feet from where we parked.

Shall we? August suggested. He was eager as ever.
We started hiking down the trail to find a place to camp. We hiked for about thirty minutes until the trail led to a small clearing that was deserted. It had a place for a fire pit, probably set up by a Park Ranger, or the owners of the trail. The clearing looked like it got plenty of use  I could see a few empty beer cans and cigarette butts near one edge of the camp. The aesthetic wasnt pleasing, but hey, beggars cant be choosers. We set up camp.

Camp consisted of a small fire and three tents. One tent was smaller, and we had reserved that one for Matt and Dana when they got there. The other two were the same size, so two people (Chris and Morgan, if I recall correctly) slept in one tent, and the rest of us (August, Lyndsey, and I) slept in the other. I dont know how we came to that arrangement, but I remember being mad that I was crammed in a tent with two other people.

I have to admit that the fresh mountain air and the hiking were doing me good. I was on the way to forgetting my worries and I was truly enjoying the time we were spending in the mountains. I remember that we climbed a bunch of huge rocks that we found in the woods near our campsite, and that August, Chris, and I played Hacky-Sack while Morgan and Lyndsey tried to get the fire going. 

At around 7:30, something hit me. I realized that Matt and Dana hadnt shown up yet. It was going to get dark soon. The sky was already that shade of orange it becomes when the sun starts setting. They wouldnt be able to find the trail in the dark.

I tapped the contact for Matt in my phone, trying to call him. Phone reception was pretty spotty in the mountains, and he wasnt picking up. At around 8, I could feel myself growing frustrated. Either Matt was ignoring me or his cellphone wasnt working or wasnt getting service or some shit. I took a break from calling and left my phone in my tent. It was sitting neatly on top of my sleeping bag, where Id be able to get to it easily if Matt called back. 

Chris and August were sitting around the fire roasting hot dogs. I sat down next to them. It was already getting pretty dark  you couldnt see past the trees at the edge of the camp anymore. But the fire was glowing fairly brightly, so I tried not worry about Matt and Dana. Chris and August were talking about high school, and all the kids we had known but would probably never see again. I listened for a while, until Lyndsey interrupted.

Hey, your phone has been buzzing for like, the last 30 minutes. She said, putting my phone in my hand.

Oh shit, thanks for telling me. I replied.

Any time. Lyndsey smiled. 

Eight missed calls from Dana and Matt. *Fuck*, I thought. I called Matt back as soon as I could. The reception was still pretty bad, but he picked up. 

Hello?

Hey Matt! Where are you guys? Its already dark here!

Were fucking lost in this stupid place. Who the fuck chose this campground?

Calm down, describe what you see, Ill help you navigate.

I see trees and rocks and literally nothing else.

Matt, try to be helpful here.

Matt handed the phone to Dana. Her tone was more relaxed than Matts.

Ignore Matt, weve been driving for a couple hours and hes in a bad mood.

Yeah I gathered that.

Which one of the trails did you stop at?

I considered her question for a minute. I had been pretty zoned out when we drove into the campsite, so I wasnt really sure. 

I dont know, but it was near the entrance to Rampart Range, if that helps any.

Uhhh. Weve passed like 20 different trails

Oh shit, right. Well, we took Morgans Dads car. Maybe you guys could look for her car?

What kind of car is it?

Hold on.

I yelled to Morgan. What kind of car did we drive here?

Morgan was in her tent, but she leaned out the flap and yelled Its a Ford Explorer!

I could hear Matt grunting something through the phone. 

Dana you there?

Yeah I am. Dana whispered something quietly to Matt. Matt, chill out Im sure hes just trying to get out of the campground.

Morgans car is a blue Ford Explorer. It should be the 3rd or 4th trail when you enter the campground.

Sounds good. I think we just drove a little too far so  Matt just pull over and let him pass

Her voice was sharp and she sounded irritated. Dana what are you talking about?

Oh, theres this guy tailgating Matt and I in a big white truck. 

Hes been following us for the last 5 miles or so, but Im sure hes just trying to find his way out of the campground.

I could hear Matt in the background of the call. He yelled Hey fucker, back off!

Dana covered the receiver with her hand so I couldnt hear Matt anymore Im going to let you go. If we get lost again Ill give you a call.

She hung up. Honestly I was relieved, you could hear how stressed she was in her tone. Everyone at our campsite was starting to get tired. Chris and Morgan wandered off to their tent to get some shut eye. That was what they told us anyway. The rumor was that they had been hooking up all summer, and this was just another opportunity to spend some alone time together. Anyway, that left August, Lyndsey and I sitting around the fire, killing time until Matt and Dana showed up. 

Around 10pm we started getting worried. It had already been a long day and camping has a way of taking it out of you. My ass was sore from sitting on the hard ground beside the fire pit. I wanted desperately to go to sleep, but I was determined to wait for Matt and Dana. I was considering calling Matt again while August and Lyndsey were talking about a mutual friend of ours named Peter, and how he had decided to go to Europe for a year instead of going to college.

Matt, it was fine. I bet he was just lost.

It sounded like Danas voice. It was coming from the trail, which was out of view behind a few trees. I stood up and walked towards the trail. Matt and Dana looked like they had been walking for the last hour or so. They were covered in dirt and pine needles. Their eyes were bloodshot and strained. There were bags underneath their eyes, and Matt walked with a slight limp. They looked exhausted. You could tell from Danas tone that they were growing tired of one another.

No Dana, that was creepy as fuck. Matt snapped.

Hey, whats going on guys? I asked.

Matts voice broke when he spoke. He didnt just sound angry he sounded scared. 
Some guy in a white truck followed us while we were driving through this stupid fucking campground.

Im sure he was just trying to find his way out of the campground. I suggested.

Yeah thats what I thought too. But then we found Morgans car. I parked beside it. I thought that when I turned the car to park, the guy who was following us would keep on driving down the road. But he didnt.

Dana was quiet. What do you mean? I asked.

Matt hesitated. When I got out of the car, the guy in the white truck just stayed there. He just sat there. Watching us.

Matt, Dana and I stood at the edge of the trail, silently. You could feel the tension in the air.

Was he there when you left the car? 

Matt nodded silently. Dana had started to cry, and Matt was pale and shaken. Ill admit that I was shivering a little myself. Lyndsey and August exchanged a quick glance.

Maybe we should just go? Lyndsey stammered. The story had clearly spooked her as well.

Yes! Lets get the fuck out of here. Matt interjected.

No! Look guys were already here. Its already dark. August argued. Lets just go to bed, and well leave in the morning okay?

Scared as we all were, August was right. It was dark, and it would take half an hour to get back to the car, never mind the drive home. We went to bed. August and I slept in one tent, with Lyndsey in between us. We were teenagers, so we felt like we needed the buffer to preserve our masculinity, I guess. Dana and Matt slept in the other tent. Our tent was in between the other two, and my sleeping bag was on the side of the tent closest to Matt and Danas tent.

It was so dark out that you couldnt see your hand two feet in front of your face. We all tried to go to sleep. I was pretty freaked out from Matts story. I couldnt sleep. I laid in my sleeping bag listening to August and Lyndsey snore loudly. The whole time, I just kept thinking about the person in the white truck who had creeped Matt and Dana out. Probably just some drunk fucker looking to mess with a couple of teenagers I thought. The wind was howling outside, making the grass outside whistle.

Around 2 in the morning, I was just starting to drift into sleep when I hear a noise by my head. 

Lyndsey, shh, Im trying to sleep. I whispered. The noise didnt sound like Lyndsey talking. It sounded like a twig snapping. It sounded like someone had someone had stepped on a stick.

I sat up. I heard the noise again. This time it was the sound of a footstep on the matted grass below it. The wet sound of the foot lifting slowly in the grass. It was coming from right beside me. It was coming from just outside my tent. Then, I heard a second noise. It sounded like something heavy was being drug through the grass. I wasnt sure what it was until I heard a metallic CLUNK as the heavy object was dragged over a rock in the grass.

*I must be imagining this*, I thought. *The noise is all in my head.*

The footsteps were getting closer and closer to the entrance to our tent. I could hear that dragging sound the whole time. I thought I was dreaming. 

Then I heard Matts voice from the other tent. Does anyone else hear that?

I felt all of my breath leave my lungs. I hear it Matt.

I was overcome by absolute terror. I think Matt was too, because he didnt say a word. All I could do was wake August and Lyndsey.

What is it-August started

 Shh. Do you hear that? I whispered.

Everyone was silent. There was no sound outside, except for the wind and the brushing of the grass against the tent. Then I heard the faintest noise. I couldnt tell what it was at first, it sounded like metal.

Then I realized. It was the zipper of my tent. It was slowly being pulled open from the outside. 

What the fuck!? August yelled. The second he yelled, the noise stopped and whoever (or WHATEVER) was unzipping our tent, started running. You could hear its heavy footsteps sprint through the campsite.

Overcome with stupidity or courage, or maybe a little of both, August tore our tent open. He ran outside to see if he could see what was fucking with us.

I dont see anything guys.

By this point, all seven of us were out of the tents. I was shaking. Matt and Dana had both been through so much, they were trembling violently.

Should we leave? Chris quivered. I think he was annoyed that his time alone with Morgan had been interrupted, but he was scared as well.

Its 3 in the goddamn morning. Its too dark to leave. I mumbled.

There were murmurs of reluctant agreement from my friends. It was too dark and early to try to leave now. No one was ballsy enough to walk back to the car in the absolute darkness that was the night. We decided that we would try to get some rest, and leave the second it was light enough out to see.

I dont think Ive ever slept worse. I was so horrified that every time the wind blew or the grass rubbed against a tent, I almost yelped. But we made it through the night. When it started to get light out, around 7 or 8 in the morning, we warily climbed out of our sleeping bags, packed up the campsite and left. I don't think any of us were really sure what had happened to us. Chris had suggested that it was a deer or something equally as harmless. No one else could dismiss our absolute terror that easily. The footsteps were too heavy to be a deer. The way it walked was so deliberate, like whatever we heard was trying not to be heard. I still have nightmares about the sound of our tents zipper slowly opening. 

--------------------------

Fuck man. Id probably hate camping too, if that happened to me. Zack lamented over his third or fourth beer.

Yeah. It was a rough night. I sighed.

Zack yawned. It was late. I had been talking for a long time. Zack chuckled and put two tens down on bar counter.

Well, god knows Im not getting any sleep tonight, after a story like that.

Yeah. Now you know how I feel.

You need a ride back? He asked.

Nah. Ill walk. The bar was only a few minutes from my apartment.

Suit yourself. Zack said, standing up and cracking his back. See you at work tomorrow?

Yeah man. See you.

As I walked home I thought about that night in Rampart Range. That night was the most terrifying night of my entire life. Zack probably thought it was a pretty good ghost story. I bet he would tell it on his fishing trip with Calvin and Will. 

But I didnt tell Zack the worst part. I wasnt sure he could have taken it.

After we left the campground, we all went home to get some sleep. After a few hours of much needed rest, Matt went in to the office where his mom worked. Shes an attorney, or something.
He was waiting for his mom to finish a meeting. While he waited, he chatted with his moms secretary, Denise.

You look tired. Rough night? She joked.

Yeah. I went camping. It was kind of crappy.

Whys that?

I dont know. I guess we just choose a sketchy place to camp is all.

Denise frowned. Where was that?

Some campground called Rampart Range, or something like that.

Denise started crying, almost immediately. Matt was startled. He told me she cried for almost thirty minutes before she was calm enough to talk again.

When Matt told me this part of the story, I asked him why she had gotten so upset. Matt went pale. He looked like he was going to cry.

Denise said her son went camping in Rampart Range a few months ago. He and his friends were attacked by someone at their campground. Their attacker ripped open their tent in the middle of the night. Her sons friends were found a day later by a park ranger, beaten within an inch of their life. Their attacker had used a heavy metal hammer on them. But they got off lucky. Denises sons body was found dismembered and strewn violently throughout the campsite. They never found the guy who did it.

I hate camping.

 Hopefully this is the right place. With the announcement of fallout 4, I realized I want to be able to play newly released games again. My last actual console was the Xbox 360, and I've been squeezing by with a decent laptop for games for the last 3 or 4 years. I can run games like l4d2, but not games like dead rising 3.

To play games like fallout 4 and dead rising 3,  would it be cheaper to build a gaming PC or get a used Xbox one?
What price ranges should I expect?

 Get a used Xbox one?






 
























 I rode the bus to school from the time I was in kindergarten until I was 16 and started driving myself to school. The one exception to that was a month when I was nine years old in which my mother drove me instead. That month began on November 3rd, 2003. After November 3rd, the school didnt have a bus to drive us to school in. More importantly, they didnt have a driver.

Up until November 3rd, our school owned only one school bus  it was your traditional number-2-pencil-yellow bus that seated 36 screaming elementary school kids. The bus picked my older brother and me up every morning from our neighborhood bus stop, which was about a block away from our house. I could just barely see my house from where we would stand when we waited for the bus. Nobody got picked up at our bus stop except for my brother and I, but the bus came by anyway. 

I dont remember riding on the school bus very well, but I remember my elementary school bus driver. His name was Thomas Blackford. Nobody called him that though. Everybody called him Mr. Tom. Mr. Tom was a big, fat man with a great grey beard and a bald head. He had one of those comfortable smiles that youd expect Santa Claus to have. He always played the radio stations that we liked and on the last day of school he gave everyone who rode the bus a bag of candy to take home. Everybody who rode the bus loved Mr. Tom.

I guess I should tell you now, Mr. Tom is dead. He died in 2003. He was murdered. I dont know exactly when he was killed, but it was sometime in early November. This is the story of November 3rd  The day I didnt get on the bus.

I was in second grade. Because the 3rd was a Monday, my brother and I hadnt ridden on the bus since the Friday before. It started like any Monday morning. That is, it started with my mom banging on the door to the bedroom that my brother and I shared and yelling If you dont get out of bed in the next five minutes, youre going to miss the bus! And theres no way Im driving you to school!It gets pretty cold here in November, so my brother, Bryan, and I had no intention of trying to walk to school. I slipped out from between my covers, groaning as I went. I got dressed and brushed my teeth. It was cold that day. I remember shivering as I slipped my blue down coat on over my shoulders. I always hated waiting for the school bus when it was cold out. Especially if it had been snowing.

Unfortunately for me, not only had it been snowing all morning, it was still snowing. There was about 3 inches of wet, slushy snow covering the street in front of my house, and more on the way. The second I opened the door so Bryan and I could leave, I was struck by a gust of frigid wind that blew wet, stinging snow into my eyes. I was already shaking by the time I stepped outside. Like I said, you could see the bus stop from my house, it was only about a block away. But in that weather, that block felt like it could have been a mile.
	
Before I could suggest to my brother that we shouldnt wait for the bus in such conditions, my mother yelled Close that door, youre letting the cold air in! 

I didnt grow up in the kind of house where you argued with a comment like that. Bryan quickly shut the door behind him, pulled his hat down over his ears, and trudged past me, through the dirty snow that lined the sidewalk. I followed Bryan, who was grumbling quietly under his breath. 

The school bus usually arrived sometime around 8:30. When Bryan and I got to the bus stop, it must have been a little before that, based on what I remember. Sometimes the bus got to our stop a minute or two late, so we werent surprised to have to wait a few extra minutes. Looking back now, everything would have been different if it wasnt snowing. My brother and I shook in the freezing snow and waited for the bus to pull around the corner at the intersection to the south of us. 

At around 8:35, I could feel my toes growing numb - my teeth were audibly chattering. I wondered if we had already missed the bus. I didnt wear a watch then, I was too young, but Bryan had a cheap, old timex watch that mom had gotten him. 

Bryan did we get here late?

No. The bus is just running a little late. 

I frowned. Bryan was not a morning person.

Are you sure? I dont think Mr. Tom has been this late before.

Yes. Im sure. Be quiet.

My hands were beginning to lock up from the cold. I could feel the joints in my fingers turn stiff and tired. Despite my down coat, I was shaking all over my body.

Thats why I felt so relieved when I saw our school bus as it turned the corner at the bottom of our street, and slowed as it pulled towards us. I was finally going to be in the heated bus where my frozen body could thaw. I couldnt wait for Mr. Tom to open the door and greet us with a hardy Good Morning and a warm grin.

But when the door opened, there was no warm grin. There was no Mr. Tom. When the door to our bus opened, I didnt see the husky frame sitting behind the wheel of the bus that I expected. I saw a small, thin man sitting on the seat. He had the bus drivers uniform on him, but it didnt fit quite right. It looked too big, like he was completely engulfed by it. His hair was thinning and covered in grease and dirt, not shiny and smooth like Mr. Toms bare head. 

The drivers smile filled his whole face. His teeth were yellowed and his gums brown and black. The most striking thing I remember about his face, however, was his eyes. They were huge, and his pupils were dilated so large that they almost completely covered the irises of his eyes. 

Wheres Mr. Tom? I asked hesitantly, as I climbed onto the first step leading up to the bus.

He called in sick today. The man spoke softly and with a disconnected rhythm. It sounded like he was straining to produce the words. I looked past him, and saw that there were only a few children sitting in their seats on the bus. Only three or four. Usually the bus was almost full by the time it got to our stop.

Where is everybody, mister? I was getting nervous, but the bus was so warm that I was drawn towards it. Bryan, who was standing behind me on the sidewalk complained loudly.

Will you just get on? Its cold out here.

Well mister, where is everyone?

Not sure. Guess they must be sick. His smile slowly faded and his lips curled into a cartoonish frown. Better get on I think were a little late.

I was still nervous, but I was only nine - young enough not to question something that an adult had told me. I put my foot on the second step of the bus and started to move forward. The bus drivers dopey frown transformed into that sick smile almost instantly as I started to move forward. I was only a few feet from him when I felt a strong hand grab my shoulder from behind. 

I was pulled back to the sidewalk by a tall woman in a bathrobe. Before I could protest or try to resist, I realized it was my mother. She had her arms wrapped around Bryan and I, and she was pulling us away from the bus.

Mom, whats wrong? Bryan asked, as she pulled him and me closer to her.

Who are you? She stammered at the driver.

The drivers face quickly melted back into a frown and his giant eyes narrowed. He didnt say anything to her.

What do you think youre doing? Who are you? My mom insisted. Her voice was shrill and full of confusion.

The driver didnt reply. Instead, the same horrible smile from before spread back over his face. He pulled the lever that closes the door, and stepped on the gas. The bus moved forward quickly, and made a sharp right turn at the end of our block. My brother, mother, and I stood in the snow, shivering, watching the bus slide slightly as it careened around the corner. Before we could ask any questions, my mother pulled my brother and I back to the house. She was frantic. Her skin looked pale, especially in her dark purple bathrobe. She looked nervous, almost scared. She just kept saying-

Hurry up. Get inside. She herded Bryan and I inside and sat us down at the dining room table. Stay here She warned.

Bryan and I were confused, and our mothers visible fear had made me scared as well. All sorts of thoughts ran through my head  maybe grandpa had another heart attack, or maybe Bryan and I had gotten in trouble for something. Why else would Mom walk all the way out to the bus stop and stop us from getting on the bus?

Bryan and I listened as she called the school district from the kitchen. I could just barely make out what she was saying.

The bus was definitely out there! No, it wasnt the usual driver! She listened intently to whoever was on the other side of the line. After a moment, she said Okay I will.

She hung up the phone and began to dial another number. 

Whats going on? Bryan asked.

Not now Bryan. I need to talk to the police.

Our mom stayed on the line with the cops for almost 20 minutes. Bryan and I looked at each other in silence as our mom told the officer on the phone about the man we saw driving the bus.

I would learn several days later that while my mom was talking on the phone, the new bus driver picked up five more children. The bus, which had eight total children on it, all between the ages of seven and twelve, would abandon its normal route at 8:52, after its 12th scheduled stop, and drive onto local highway 78. The driver would accelerate to over 100 miles per hour, according to eyewitness reports. The bus would begin violently weaving in and out of its lane, coming close to hitting several different vehicles who would later call 911 to report its erratic behavior. 

At approximately 9:17, despite the desperate pleas of the crying children aboard the bus, it would drive onto the only bridge in Gilliman County. It would cross about half of the bridge, according to the bridges caretaker, Kris Lopez. Mr. Lopez would later tell reporters that the bus made a violent right turn at the center of the bridge. He would explain that he could see the terrified face of a little girl screaming from one of the windows as the bus broke through a metal guard rail and fell into the icy river. 

The official police report would state that all nine bodies were found. Dead. The bus had crashed through the ice at the top of the river and floated approximately a mile before it became stuck on a patch of rocks and a downed tree. All of the occupants of the bus had intense bruising, blood loss, and broken bones.

The police officer who went to the home of Thomas Blackford to ask him about the incident would find his door unlocked and the inside of his home completely trashed. When looking in his bedroom, they would find his corpse horribly mutilated. The Giliman County Coroner would tell reporters that Mr. Tom was most likely murdered by an intruder while he slept. The cops would find that his bus drivers uniform and keys to the bus had been stolen.

This is all the information Ive been able to find about the day that I almost got on that bus. Theres probably a lot more information out there about November 3rd, but I imagine a lot of it hasnt been released to the public. Ive read almost every newspaper story, eyewitness report, and police document that I could bring myself to. None of it has answered the question that I cant seem to stop asking myself.

Why wasnt I on that bus? I had been a step away from joining the kill count of the horrible little man who murdered Mr. Tom and those eight children. I was so close to dying in that crash. I still wake up in the middle of the night, imagining that little girls crying face as the fender struck the ice, going god knows how fast. I cant stop imagining the way the drivers disgusting smile as he drove the bus off that bridge. My survival haunts me. Why wasnt I on the bus?

The closest thing I have to an answer to that question was what my mother told when she got off the phone with the officer that morning, on November 3rd.

I asked her- Mom, whyd you stop us from getting on the bus?

Tears started filling her eyes as she told Bryan and me the truth.

The school called. Today is a Snow Day. The bus shouldnt have been running at all.
