 Alright, I knew this much, but thanks for replying! 




 You should go back, because it is as good as you remember, I promise you.

Why does the download speed fluctuate in the pattern it does? I don't know much about the way internet magic works, but you can explain it in full science if it is easiest for you and I'll google the words I don't understand.

Edit: To be clear, that last line was a joke. I'm sure I'll understand however you explain it. Thanks for the replies so far!

Final Edit: Among the other good replies, 3brushie answered my question completely. I'd link to his comment, but not only do I not know how to do it the Reddit way, but it's also only about 10 inches down the page. Thanks askscience, I hope we can do this again sometime. 




 What are the chances that we in America won't get the Freedom edition?  It's announced in Europe and Asia, but we have no word of it coming to America. With only a few months to go before the release, it seems like the winners of the American Revolution won't get the game based on the American Revolution. What do you guys think? 




 Ocdscale and mmer, thanks, that is good to know. That does make a big difference in how I feel about it. I'll be turning that on as soon as I play next for sure 




 Again, ice armor and crystal skin are very different, but I see what you're saying. I've tried all of these combos, just can't find one that *really* works 




 I thought of that, and I tried the bubble, but the spear throwers' spears go over half way through the bubble before they are slowed, which made my head explode. Losing wave of force for the slightly useful bubble wasn't worth it. More signs point to elective mode 




 Same here, no worries 




 On that note, gold goes fast in the auction house. Good places to farm? 




 I use the ice armor ability that freezes enemies when they swing at me and slows them when they're near. Crystal skin is too precious to replace with that ice aoe, so elective mode it is? 




 Hahaha, actually it absorbs near 3000... If I didn't make this clear, I'm not new to gaming, but I am new to this game style. I'm not good at building characters based on armor stats :/ 




  The "normal" mode as you call it 

I thought that's what the first difficulty is called. Am I wrong?
 




 Like I said, I don't have my pc near me otherwise I would. I have around 230 intelligence and 1500 health I believe. About 126 arcane power. I generally two shot the standard enemies of the beginning of act 3 with arcane orb, but when I run out of arcane power its impossible to kite because I cant move fast enough to dodge attacks 




 So I realize I'm probably pretty terrible at this game, but its very tough for me not to die as a wizard on act 3 in *normal* difficulty. I use ice armor, crystal skin, wave of force, spectral blade, and arcane orb.


First off, I don't like the idea of elective mode. I think you should play the game as it was originally intended to be played. Am I just going to have to get over that?


Second, any strategies for me as a noob for surviving? The spear throwers, demons who stick they're arms in the ground, and fireball spitting bat things kill me pretty fast, because I can't move away fast enough to not get hit. Any advice would be awesome!


Btw, I believe I'm level 24, (away from my pc right now) and I don't play often because I'm more of a console gamer. Help me get back into diablo!


Edit: Thanks so far for all the helpful tips. It looks like I need to go ahead and buy auction house items (something I was against) and use elective mode (something else I was against). Ill give these a try 




 I'm friends with a lot of my brother's friends on Facebook, and this is what I have to put up with for being polite. Sadly I don't know them so I can't tell them off for being stupid. 









 Haven't found/been able to create an item with life absorption yet, but I'll keep that in mind. And I haven't been using stun, but I suppose you're right. I'm just afraid it won't affect a large boss like the Skeleton King. I don't have a templar yet but I'll use him when I get him. Thanks for the advice so far. Sounds like I need to make a *little* bit more progress until I'm in the clear. 




 I've been playing as a monk, but never playing alone. Fighting everything is easy. Now that I'm trying to play a bit of the game solo, it's not as easy. I started a new character as a barbarian, and while it is easy, I'm still afraid I'm not doing it right. My only question is, how do I fight a boss where it's 1v1, when I have to get up close and hammer him? Do I just have to rely on healing potions? I'm about level 9 and getting close to fighting the skeleton king. Any advice would be great! 




 Alright, sounds good, and thanks again. I like speed fighters like ezio auditore or sora in final form, but the wizard's skill pool looks so diverse and exciting. I'm sure any class will cater to a different taste of mine though 




 Thanks everyone for the replies, especially fuzzybootz. I figured Diablo wouldn't have VOIP, but it sounds like his computer will be fine. He bought it about a month ago, but it's a low level g7. It has a quad core processor at 1.5 GHz, and his graphics card is an AMD Radeon HD 6520g. My small amount of knowledge tells me he will be fine, but I've never actually ran a weak computer, as I've only owned the one I built specifically for being awesome.

Another question if you don't mind:

* On classes... I don't want to match my friends, and one is sure he will be a wizard. I like the monk if I can't play Wizard, but he looks like he can be boring. What do you guys *think* I should play as, since I know no one has played these specific classes yet?

(More background, I play a mace and shield wielding Nord and a dual-wielding Argonian assassin on my PS3, and I played a High Elf mage on PC and a healer for a month on WoW. So I pretty much like any class so far.) 




 Hey everyone, I'm new to r/Diablo, Diablo in general, and really Reddit in general, and I was hoping you of the community could give me some pointers. I would have been eight when Diablo 2 came out, so my parents never let me play it. Now that I can make my own adult choices, I'm picking up Diablo 3.

My questions:

* What quick info should I know about the lore of Diablo?

* What voice communication system do we use?

I like Skype, but I'd prefer an in game system if there is one, so my friend's internet/processor aren't affected.

* Does Diablo demand much on lowest settings?

My computer will run Crysis on max, so I'm not worried, but my buddy's laptop isn't very powerful. I just want to make sure if he has to use Skype, his processor won't be too bogged down even with Diablo at it's least. He is also afraid it won't run it. Our fingers are crossed.

* Will this game be worth it for me?

I know you are all Diablo fanatics, being that you're here, but I hate wasting money, having so little of it and all. I play Battlefield 3 religiously, Skyrim just slightly less, and I own every Pokemon game (that's just to brag, not to show my gaming style). Played WoW for a free month, liked it, but couldn't afford the subscription.

Thanks in advance for any good replies. I want to be ready in exactly 12 hours. haha

Edit: Formatting! Thanks fuzzybootz! 




 That probability assumes 100% of redditors view the material. The 90,000 difference would come from that smaller percentage of users who don't click every link. 




 This is legit miss. I just moved into an apartment two miles from this target, saw it one night and thought to do just this. If you really want proof I could probably get it for the op by tomorrow! Haha 




 I actually translated the card in full once back in the day. It's not gibberish. The letters repeat in a way that you can use the fact that you know mew's name to decipher it. Everyone try it! 




 Part of Jesus's message was revoking the false-preaching made by the Pharisees at that time. Man had created a right-and-wrong separate from what God initially told them. The religious leaders at the time (not much unlike Catholic priests today) were far from what God was about, and Jesus came to abolish that false-Church. When the description refers to "the differences between Jesus and false religion," it isn't saying Christianity (the Jesus part) is better than other religions, it is referring to Jesus calling out, so to speak, the Pharisees on their falsehoods. They put themselves in places of "God-appointed" power, which was false. 

The definition of religion is what is becoming confused here. And when he says he loves the church, he is saying he loves the idea of what church is supposed to stand for, like unity through faith, or allowing anyone in (Jesus was around the "bad" people more than the "good"). Church in our time has again fallen into a man-made invention, interpreting the Bible in such a way that says we should be against gay rights, etc. Christianity is the following of Christ, but the Christianity he is calling religion is the term man gave to the religion they follow, which has fallen away from the path that leads towards Jesus.

tl;dr - Definitions are getting mixed up, and mixed together. Be careful of that.

IAmA Christian Scientist, but I'm no theologian. This is how I interpreted the video myself. I'm not claiming that I'm right, since I'm obviously quoting the Bible, a book most of you believe is nonsense. This is the logic that makes sense to me. If I said something that doesn't make sense please pick it apart. I'm new to reddit and I'm trying to find welcome here in /r/atheism even with the beliefs I hold.

 And in that respect, I think we should realize that the devs do have a vision for the game, and, because they opened up a suggestions section on their website's forum, that they would probably love suggestions. And surely they can sort through the good and bad ones. Trust me, I've read almost every suggestion, and many are too much; they'll see it the same. 




 I may be the only one who feels this way, but this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvxS_bJ0yOU by Frederic Chopin is how I imagined the "Title Screen," with, say, an early sunrise, or sunset are shown as it pans across the islands. If you're talking menu, as in the music that pops up whenever you pull up the menu, it would have to be fast and noticeable like everyone is saying, because the menus probably won't spend too much time on screen. 
























 As an average man who has been crushed by his single cat being hit by a car, I can attest to this. 




 While your *science* is right, you left out the main ingredient to pegasi, dragons, and large beards: magic. 




 Yeah, I generally use it for CQB, but I like how it can handle targets at range effectively if you know what you're doing. The P90 and MP7 and worthless past anything other than buildings, otherwise I'd be using the MP7 everywhere. 




 SEAL Team 7 has a clan server up. When we are in, we keep it in good condition 




 Oh ok, forgot that variable. Thanks for making it known 




 First of all, llama and infectios, your posts are not helpful and annoyingly pointless to the post, please read the reddiquette.

In regards to the post, I think the beacon would be overpowered if everyone could spawn on it. Imagine if all 12 soldiers or even 32 spawned on it at once. It would be extreme mayhem. The idea would be cool, helpful, and useful, but way too powerful. They would have to put a security measure on it, like a half second or full second spawn delay between each spawn if they made this possible. 




 It released the 4th with premium in the US. Where are you located?



Edit: they were unplayable from a bug for like a day or two however 




 I suggest you buy it for xbox. Comparing pc to console is like comparing apples to oranges, simply uncomparable. That being said, buy a good gaming pc later. premium is more worth it now than it will be as more dlc releases, but pc gaming can be more fun. Its really up to you. 


Tl;dr - Buy premium now on xbox, then pc later down the road for other gaming frontiers 




 He mentioned jets, but his post mostly concerned helicopters. You only have rockets in a helo if you're an AA pilot, so we need pods to do something. Read the post better next time before you make a fool of yourself 




 I was about to post a thread there, then thought, there are more interactive andy's on BL then intelligent people, so I came here haha 




 My main gun is the PDW-R, and I use it on medic or support mainly because I'm pretty bad with rifles and completely trash with LMGs. I'm great with carbines and snipers, otherwise id use it their too.  




 Yeah I saw that text shrink as well. He literally bumps his troll posts if they're stagnant for an hour to get the responses coming. Its so sad. 




 Yeah, I saw the troll post. Of course his kdr and skill are high, he hides in the back while getting mav kills only. No deaths means no drop in skill.  




 The last 30 seconds were most gripping, as I expected the soldier we were following to get knifed by the recon near the end, so they could share their remorse.  




 Yeah, this. I tried to record some footage back in the alpha so I could give feedback, but my super powerful pc was incapable of playing and recording simultaneously.  




 I was exaggerating, but 3 or 4 is less than 6 to 11. It must have just been the very few times I was playing that it happened 




 It only takes like a single bullet to kill people on hardcore lol I think the thing that turned me off to it was the stupid blueberries not realizing that there is friendly fire, so I die from my own soldiers constantly. Super off putting 




 I never really play hardcore. Idk why. It's not like it's too difficult, it's just less fun for me. You enjoy it more?

 Never used the extinguisher, but that's because I thought it could only be used once. Is it pretty useful now? 




 Surviving within an inch of life after an epic slaughter... These are battlefield moments that I play for 




 These are the moments when you feel good, like you're a true, skilled soldier. Good feel 




 Are you in my clan? We feel this way everyday haha 




 After playing close quarters with conquest domination, capping a regular conquest flag feels like the microwave minute from hell. I know the feeling 




 I would like to hear any of your more unusual moments where your first reaction drenched you in the fear that you would soon meet your demise, but your valorous Battlefieldian mindset brought you through to victory. Here's mine:

Today I was capturing point Bravo on Caspian Border, when a large tree on the C side of the capture point was knocked down somehow. The tree pinned my soldier so I could run around between the branches, but I was trapped within them until it disappeared. In all of my long hours since the game released in October, this has never happened to me. Meanwhile, through the brush, I witnessed a jeep with two men drive up, and a third soft target following close behind. I quickly threw on my big boy pants, locked and loaded, and screamed my war cry as I fired on the jeep's driver first, killing him, then his gunner, with a few (probably lucky) shots. The third man discovered my hideout but I used my prison to my advantage, using the branches as a shield, successfully luring him one way so that I could shoot him in the back and rain victorious, just prior to the tree vanishing. I successfully held Bravo while hiding in what I had assumed would be my grave, and now I want to hear your stories. Anything is fine, but preferably the strange. 




 Thank you, this sufficiently answers my query, and it makes perfect sense. I doubt uTorrent cares enough, or is even capable of showing a more defined graph, one which would support to what you are referring. Good enough for me.  




 I can watch the graph update every second. Does it calculate it in reference to the prior speed? Or through some other equation? If what you're saying is true then the graph it supplies me while it's downloading the torrent is a farse, and it's not showing me real speed data.

The way I'm making sense of what you're saying, is that when the transmissions are interrupted, the speeds decelerate, which is why they fall, until they can connect to another peer, where they begin to lift again? Let me know if this is a completely false assumption. 




 The last sentence sort of answers my question. I suppose that make sense. Dropping and picking up peers would appear to cause that, except the slopes are pretty defined over proper intervals, so there should be more to it than that. 
























 Longest headshot or longest headshot on a chopper pilot? 




 I live in an apartment, alone, in wichita, ks, and if I made even $20,000 a year it would cover everything for me. That would include car, insurance, tuition, rent, food (the highest cost for someone with my appetite), internet, electricity, and phone. Anything more than that and I could freely spend it on anything. Granted my apartment may be a bit drab to some, and I don't drink, and I don't need fancy things to be happy. I'm still shooting for ~100k for my career salary, but that's for financial security. 




 Your trolling is successful! I don't even play the game, and I still hate you. Keep up the good work! 




 My apologies, I don't know the rules to reddit, and I'm on my my phone always so I can't read them. What does it matter anyway?  




 Your fun fact made me sad. That shouldn't be a fun fact.. 




 Was this a parody/joke they were doing for the class? Or were they serious? 




 Fun fact: The particles that we *smell* are not the same as the actual particles. So smelling poop does not mean there is poop floating in your nose. Reddit taught me that! 




 Best way to do it is by uploading your image to imgur.com, which is in itself very simple, then paste that link 




 I'm level 30 and I play *lite* hours, on regular servers. If you play those 1750 ticket metros even 3 or 4 times a week, you'll easily be up there pretty fast, assuming you have some sort of skill.  




 Like if it rolled on its back and I wanted to tickle its belly, it would slice the flesh off my fore arms. I see.. 




 Well I'd have a conversation. Haha that was my problem. I was always as friendly as I could be, and I was tipped generously for it, but when you wonder why you don't have your drinks yet, it's because you told me the story about how you became the prince of bel air, and I just can't be in two places at once. You just don't tell the customer to their face that you don't have time to talk to them. 




 Well that is unfortunate. I would really like a lion cub or two to spruce up the apartment, but I'm definitely not trained to handle that. Thanks for the reply! 




 I saw that post with the picture of the lion cub in the front seat of taco bell guy's car, and had this question. If I raised my own lion cub from birth to adulthood, is it DNA-wired to be a predator? Would it eat birds and my neighbors cats and eventually my annoying neighbors when it is an adult? Or would it only act as I trained it, so it could just be my really frightening looking house cat? 




 This will sound weird, but please don't try to be my friend if the restaurant is full. I usually had five tables minimum, and if you literally talk to me for five minutes about my life or yours, that's great, but it throws off my entire night, because I keep a flawless routine. Come in later when we are slow if you want my life story, that's when I'm glad to give it 




 That's entirely personal. People not stacking plates drove me absolutely insane when I was a waiter. The conglomeration of trash and plates spread over the table always took longer to clean then whatever the kind customer did for me. I think it's better for the server to be more flexible in handling what is given to them. 




 To all current or future Subway employees:

*Coat* the bread rolls in herbs, don't just dip one side in, they're so much better that way.

Proof to about 13", they shrink when they bake.

Always wipe excess cheese off the baking forms, it'll save *literally* hours of cleaning later

Last, bake them so that they're light brown, still visibly green from the herbs, and the cheese isn't burnt. You all suck at this part a lot and the bread tastes awful because of it.

I was a Sandwich Artist at Subway, and I put the art in artist. 




 This was the answer I was looking for. I figured it was just a mirror of some sort, but I didn't give it a close look, and it looked completely real. Thanks for this.

Edit: Look at the base of the flag for example. How is that being done? That's not a mirrored image, and I don't see any other part of the image that it could have been taken from. 




 I've never used photoshop before in my life, and I'm 20 years old. I saw [this gif](http://arixev.deviantart.com/art/Diablo-3-Act-2-Wallpaper-How-i-made-it-307916030) today and thought, how is this even happening? Do pictures like the character loading screen have multiple layers, so that you can crop out the character's layer and the background image will exist beyond it? I know photoshop uses layering and other magic like that, but I need more explanation. 




 I get it! The clown is deaf! Right?? Guys? 




 Mine forgets where the AC vents are everyday, and when she finally finds them again she gets super excited and decides that she is the only one allowed to have air conditioning after that. 




 Pretty much any day I would open the freezer door when I first got my husky, she would sit in it at the bottom just like this. She still tries and she is massive 




 It's the tinfoil-hat comments that make me realize I have no idea what is going on 80% of the time here on Reddit.  




 http://imgur.com/f0B01

You have negative downvotes, while people usually have positive downvotes.  




 Excited, excited, EXCITED.

Then you let me down. I'm gonna go with, you say it means nothing so I don't investigate more, and uncover a truth you don't want me to. This isn't over. 




 I'm new to reddit and the RES as well, but why does your karma say (2|-1)? Is that not the same as (3|0)? What is happening? 




 I want to downvote you for trying to do something heinous, but I also want to upvote you for possibly actually believing that you would appreciate that more than me.

And, kittensngravy, that would be awesome, but I cannot ask that of you. Thank you anyway!

 I worked at best buy, and frequently felt morally obligated to tell people to go to newegg or equivalent to find their hdmi cables. Best buy matches prices of stores like walmart anyway, so I'm going to guess that's why their stocks are declining. 




 I've never played Half Life 2 (I know, I'm waving my own pitchfork at myself). Is it something I shouldn't deny myself? 




 I understand what you're saying Mr. Reason, but then 90% of Reddit would have to be downvoted if we downvote based on comments which do not add to the conversation. But thank you for answering me. 




 [This is the worst I've seen](http://imgur.com/T6R1x). And yes, he was taking up the two lanes in front of him as well. Whenever I'd be out with friends, we would always park all of our cars as close to these guys as possible, while still remaining legally parked. Sometimes they couldn't get the car out without risking damaging our (crappy) cars, and literally had to wait for us to leave.  




 Why is patrick being downvoted? He didn't say it means "fuck that, fuck you," he is pointing out that people thought it was that, like he thought it was fifty/fifty. And he said he knows what it means. I'm literally reiterating his post. He shouldn't be downvoted for this. 









 Back in the beta, I used to shoot out the lights in the subway train (like the ones in the last picture) just outside of the red-lit, raised service tunnel. I would lay there in the dark, then when the enemy would turn that corner I'd flip my flashlight on, blinding them by the drastic change in light, then annihilate them. Good times were had those days. 




 Gotcha. It's kind of a catch 22, because you really need to know her sense of humor well in order to put yourself in a position to get to know her better. If you said, "Hey, I wasn't sure if you got my message, but etc," it won't sound as good (funny) as if you said something like, "Hey [girlname], I was busy stalking your page the other day after we met and realized I really wanted to get to know you past what Facebook shows." Throw a smiley in or something. This worked for me, but my girlfriend has a stellar sense of humor, so as long as the girl you're going after would find that funny, go for it. Stay lighthearted and be confident that she'll laugh when you send it. 




 If you can be funny about it, there isn't a limit, but she may just be busy. Facebook makes stalking easy, since it now shows you if the other person has seen your message. Don't think she is ignoring you, be confident she just didn't get time to reply if anything. I think 48 hours is generally a good rule of thumb.

Btw, 10 hours ago was yesterday for you? Where do you live? 10 hours ago was this morning for me. haha 




 Awesome, I'm glad I could be of some help! Let us know how it goes! 




 Hey Bachenalien, ignore the nosey people who want to know about whatever the camp is. I can't imagine why they're so interested, but since you don't want it out there, it's none of their business.

Onto the girl, she likes you already. I have no idea what she is like, but you could try something forwardly cute. It's easy to message people on Facebook, so ask her to a movie. She'll likely be confused, so you then say that you'll both rent the same movie and start it at the same time, and you two will talk on the phone while it's going. **Ask her for her number then** and you can have a sweet, long distance date that way. You have her number, she'll hopefully like the gesture, and you can go from there.  




 Play either Brotherhood or Revelations. Brotherhood was my favorite. It has the best mechanics out of all the games (though AC2, AC:B, and AC:R are all basically the same). If you're playing one to get up to speed on the game before 3, I would play Revelations, obviously. It's the last in line so far. I suggest you play all of them if you ever get around to it. They're all great games. 




 **My short background:** I don't know much about cars. I've driven my mother's hand-me-down Mazda MPV since I could drive at 15 (I'm 20). My favorite car used to be the RX-8 but a friend of mine got one and he was kind enough to update the world with every problem he ever had with the car, which was just about daily. Even driving the way I do, easy on the car, that car seems too much of a hassle.

**Current situation:** I'm looking to buy a car in the near future, as the radiator in my van has a life-ending crack in it and is out of commission. We could easily replace that, but it doesn't seem worth it. So my plan is to purchase a new car. I just need to make the decision on appearance or fuel economy.

I am a fan of the newer Camaros, but I'm on the fence about getting one or some really great Hybrid car. I've heard hybrids aren't worth it for numerous reasons, but I want Reddit's opinion. I wouldn't be driving the Camaro like a racecar, I just love the appearance of it. I feel like it would be a better decision to get a car with great MPG. If the hybrids aren't worth it because of their downsides I'll probably stick to the Camaro. If I'm getting a car for MPG then the appearance isn't that big of a deal. Advice?

**TL;DR** Need a new car, are hybrids actually as good as they're hyped to be, or should I stick with something I like to look at, like a Camaro? 




 I thought guy sensei! And its totally believable, you're right 




 Haha ok thanks! The only martial arts movie I've seen is ip man. Other than that I'm out of the loop. That's what r/movies is for I guess! 




 Thanks for the replies! She mentioned Hero but believed that wasn't it. She must have just been mixed up. She couldn't figure it out, and I had also just introduced her to reddit. In order to show her the might of reddit, I said, "watch, reddit will solve this mystery." Thanks for killing two birds you two! 




 There is a martial arts movie I'm trying to find the name of. A friend of mine is trying to find it again but she can only remember some of it. Apparently every scene has a color scheme, where all the fighters wear the same colors as the background. She says it's extremely vivid and colorful. Like the background will literally be made up of a sea of yellow flowers while the martial artists will be wearing all yellow robes. I know that's not much to go off of, but she said most of the scenes in the movie are like that, which should pretty much give away the movie if anyone has seen it. I have no idea how old the movie is. If anyone can help me figure this out I will forever be grateful. Thanks! 




 This is not a problem with the world it's a problem with your self-perception.

What do you mean by that? I don't have a problem with my self-perception. 




 Ladies, I'm in a similar situation as Brrring. I doubt he meant it that way. I met a girl and thought she was literally my age (20) while she is actually 28. I had no idea. It's not a jump from youth to old age, it's more of a jump from college-age girl beauty to young adult beauty. There is a difference, but it's hard to explain, and neither is less beautiful than the other. 




 Pretty sure it's the other way around. Orangutans use their arms to do pretty much everything, including moving themselves around, so her arms were stronger than her legs. But yeah, flip those two things and you're pretty much right. 




 I couldn't stand being around someone like that, but I could definitely fight fire with fire. Is this something you can laugh at now? Or is it just something bad you found out about him after a long time? haha 




 I just learned the other day from one of my BEST friends, that back before he met me, when he was engaged to my other best friend, that when she invited him to one of my band's concerts, he would record us playing, and post the recordings to Youtube under the title, "Worst band in recorded history." Had I known at the time, I would have hated him. Since then I have met him, and obviously become good enough friends that he felt comfortable divulging that piece of hilarious information. I now know that our band was pretty awful back then, so I just laugh now knowing that. Anyone have a similar story, where you laugh at something hurtful in the past? 




 So I wanted to ask someone why they featured a post on r/srs, but realized after posting it that I can only have downvotes or double downvotes instead of downvotes or upvotes respectively. Am I just sleep deprived or is that actually how the subreddit works? 




 Agreed, when I saw this I thought, that girl must flirt with the drunk guys for bigger tips, because I was an awfully good server and the most I ever made was $400 over 4 days, and I'm a guy.  




 You're actually quite wrong. I was a server, and my wage was $2.15 an hour, but if I didn't make at least minimum wage they *did not* make up the difference.

And if you think washing dishes or cooking food is more difficult than being a server you are dead wrong. Serving is one of the hardest jobs. You can't really know how truly awful it is until you've been a server. I would work 12 hour days without enough time for a break or lunch, constantly on my feet moving throughout the restaurant serving six or more tables at any given time. When it gets that busy, people get irate because they don't get served in time. The servers' job is not only to carry plates. You have to keep a lot of people happy, keep their drinks filled, check to make sure they have everything they need at basically any given moment during their meal.

You're absolutely insane if you think servers get paid too much. Please, *try* to be a server for a month and you'll completely change your mind. 




 Yeah, I'm on ps3 and it cuts out for me nearly every game. It's literally game breaking for me. I heard a *rumor* that it would be extremely difficult to fix, however I doubt it's true. We just have to keep on playing until DICE gives us something 




 Oh ok. Mine is like 850. I don't find long headshots that impressive. Its the sniping people out of moving jeeps and things like this video that are awesome. 




 Because you don't actually have units on a real jet hud. I agree its annoying, but we're expected to know how it is 
























 I cringe thinking about it, but I'd take a downgrade back to the old USAS Frag combo of death over the current state of the game. I miss the old version of the game :\ 




 I will decorate every wall of my one bedroom apartment with posters of your art, if you sell them. These are phenomenal! 




 As in bytes. I know very little about rendering environments in games, but I figured they can only load a certain amount of information before the game starts to drop in frame rate, lag, etc. If I downloaded information through my eyes in a similar way, how much information would I be downloading, in terabytes or however great the number might be? 




 Definitely will. Thanks blue! 




 Yes, click and zombies die. 




 I was completely serious haha. I am so happy I might die 




 OMG. HOW THE FUCK HAVE I NOT HEARD OF THIS. This is insane. It is LITERALLY what I just posted. I'm the happiest person alive right now. 




 Are you guys serious? Yes, I have lived under a rock for quite some time now. What is Dayz?
 









 If it means anything past the downvotes, I laughed when I read this. haha 




 I don't know much about the cards themselves, but I got an electric Charmander card. I'm confused, what is it? I thought it was a ditto or something at first but it is definitely a Charmander. 




 Really, I *almost* believed it, but when derp in the corner wasn't moving, and herp by the door *also* wasn't moving, it really ruined it. The MAV just letting you lock onto it was suspicious enough.  




 That's what I thought, but I turned the other cheek, hoping it would not be a big deal once work starts. I believe my job requires me to be constantly working, 6-8 hours straight. I'm hoping that keeps the talk time with the boss low. 




 He tells me, "If you get fired from HerpDerp Tires Co., you fired yourself." We'll see who gets the last laugh. 




 Well it's an easy, full-time job, and I have college tuition and rent to pay, so it's not a big deal. My plan is to tell my manager, assuming he brings up religion again, that I'd rather leave religion out of my work environment.  




 That's what I was thinking. I must tread lightly... 




 **TL;DR:** My new employers are Christians running a business completely unaffiliated with religion. Asked me religious questions in interview. Don't necessarily share beliefs. Can they legally do anything about it?


I live in Kansas if that matters (law-wise). I was recently hired to work at a business that sells car tires. It's not a church, it's not spreading the word of God, but they're obviously Christian owned (paper on the door asks people to not swear, then follows with Bible verses).

Anyway, when I was in my pretty laid-back you-already-got-the-job kind of interview for this particular business, I was asked if I was sleeping with my girlfriend or had any illegitimate children running around. As a redditor, I don't know what a girl is, so I said no. He then follows by saying, "You don't have to be a Christian to work at HerpDerp Tires Co., but we do have prayer time in our meetings. You can participate if you want." I'm like, okay, fine, that's your thing. I'm just worried they might find some reason to fire me if I disagree religiously.

Also, while I do believe in God and was raised Southern Baptist Christian, I can guarantee I don't share my beliefs with these people. I need a job though or I can't afford my rent, and this was a great opportunity. Am I safe, or is there some legal reason that they might be able to fire me in the future? 




 I'm easily convinced, I'm buying it. Thanks for the suggestion! 




 Dead Island surely scares me. I close my eyes every time I climb ladders with zombies following close behind. Haha.

Is the game fun enough to buy? I know $5 isn't much, but I don't want to waste it if it's not worth it. 




 Had not thought of that. I took a Geology 300 class last year, and vaguely remember how little we have. We were taught that we have enough to sustain our existence, but it just gets more and more difficult to get to, even though technology gets more and more advanced. This surely would cause a great problem for us if we couldn't find a way to harness the sun/wind/water more efficiently right off the bat. 




 That's also true. I didn't really define either. Assuming all was completely annihilated somehow but everyone didn't die in the process, then we would be stuck at square one. However, if everything is just wrecked from bombs or some other WW3 type destruction, then we would have the rubble to use to rebuild. We would have to separate each element in the rubble, which would also take technology though. 




 Is this a game I should buy? I'm terrified of zombies, but I kill them to help lessen my fear. I play Dead Island with two of my friends on PS3, and if this is a game you guys think I should buy then I'll convince them to get it too. 




 That was my assumption. I was also curious as to how small the layers would get as we reach similar levels to where we are now. Like for instance, we use computers to run machines that build computers. Rebuilding the computers without the machines, in order to run the machines, would be another layer we probably couldn't circumvent. 









 They should also add what vehicle a player is using. It'd be pretty helpful as well. 




 Alright, I'll probably try those next. Yes sweet, Peabody is a near nonexistent town a couple miles from Newton, another pretty small town. I didn't think anyone from Peabody would be on Reddit, but you never know, might as well try. 




 This is related to my post a few hours ago. My friend found a gray cat with white socks with no collar unfortunately. It was found off of Highway 50 near the Coneburg in Peabody, KS. If anyone knows anything about it, the girl who found it would be thankful to give it back since she had her cat picked up the same way a few months ago and never got it back. She is sad that someone can't find their cat, assuming it belongs to someone. Thanks if anyone can help. 





























 Well ghost, I will surely look into it. I looked up a few earlier that were anywhere from $60 to $180 per appointment. At this point, if it'll help me help her, money won't be a problem. How do I go about looking for one of these in my area? Google, psychotherapy in city, state? 




 All of the advice is definitely helping. She has been working since 8:00 this morning though so I haven't been able to contact her. She was going to get off late Sunday and our plans were just to have me stay over at her place. We made these plans last night after she changed like this. It was only last Sunday when she was over, smiling, and we were perfectly fine. And she doesn't lie well, so I would know if she was hiding something. Is changing that fast common? And is there a possibility she'll have a mood swing back to happiness? 




 Thank you Star. I probably won't see her for awhile because of the distance and her work schedule assuming she cancels the recent plans we made. Will it be detrimental if I spend too long away? It's not my choice. I just can't drop in unannounced because she's almost always at work. 




 Okay. I texted her asking if the plans we made Sunday are still on. Should I not be giving her the option to say no? I don't want to push her too hard. 




 That lifts my spirit actually, the last thing you said, assuming you're right about it. She has the kind of depression that she feels like a burden on others though, especially me, and doesn't want me around. Do I push her to allow me to spend time with her like you said? Or is that a bad idea? 




 I hate to say this, but I probably can't afford it. I've thought of doing this though. I want to be able to understand so I can help if she ever does turn to me again. Are therapists relatively inexpensive? I will do just about anything right now to be of any help to her. 




 I'll take your advice, no matter how hard it will be for me, to leave her be as long as she needs. We actually don't live together, she lives about 35 minutes from me, so I can't really be close to her right now. I myself feel helpless since I'm so far away, and the only mode to speak with her is via text, since she can't be on the phone at work and she doesn't have a computer. 




 Is it common that people can't? I know it's only been a few days but it's still very scary for me. She thinks she just needs to be alone but won't listen when I tell her it's her depression saying that, and I want to be there for her. 




 **TL:DR: My girlfriend was diagnosed by a therapist with depression, and she is trying to push me away. I read that that was one of the symptoms and I need to stop her from doing that. What should I do?**

My girlfriend just started seeing a therapist (she has been to one session, her therapist was sick so she had to cancel the second) and she was already diagnosed with depression on the first visit. It's extremely frustrating for me right now because she is trying to push me away and isolate herself because she thinks she is just going to bring me down. I'm afraid she will push me away until she thinks I won't want her back no matter what I say.

I don't know what to do... Should I just be patient with her and hope the therapy sessions work? We were very serious about our relationship , and not three days ago everything was perfect. She all of a sudden snapped one day and completely locked up. She lives a bit away from me so I don't get to see her as often as either of us would like, but it's mostly because of her work schedule. She works way too much, so much that she pretty much works dawn to dusk six days a week and she doesn't have to, and it hurts her sleeping schedule.

She is at the point where she already won't listen to me because she thinks things are hopeless and just wants to give up. She isn't normally like this. She is usually the happiest person in the world, bringing immense joy to anyone around her. I'm worried about her well-being. I need to know if I should just be patient and let her do what she needs to do, or if I should prevent herself from pushing away the people in her life who care about her. I'm at a loss. Please, someone help me. 




 My subconscious is an evil genius. I wish that were true. And you're probably right. Oh well! 




 I know.. I'm stupid... But there were only 4 other players on the map and I figured most were in Elektro or Cherno so I thought it wouldn't be a big deal. I haven't quite figured out where the more trafficked areas are yet. 




 When I first fired it, I thought, this should be called the dinner bell, not the enfield. But for some reason when I was on the ground and shot a zombie none of the others came running. I think it was a glitch at first :\ 




 I managed to reach the Chernarus International Airfield about an hour ago, armed with a crossbow and two bolts. After killing a couple of zombies and two of them unfortunately falling on top of the bolts, I was left without those precious arrows I love so much. With a useless weapon, I decided to discard it in the bushes and grab my ax.

I spent a good amount of time searching the ENTIRE airfield. Not a building was left unchecked. The first weapon I found was an AKS Kobra, which was great, but I *really* wanted a silenced weapon. So I left it be, and continued to the other end of the airfield. After finding about 6 AKs and AKMs, a shotgun or two, and about 3 G17s, I decided to make my way back to the AKS with a Kobra. After reaching the spot where I had originally found it, I discovered I had somehow managed to completely overlook an M14 AIM lying in the same building. Tears rolled down my face. I still feel new to the game, and this was the greatest thing I could have found.

I leave the building (I assume was the barracks) and head to the tall hangar building. I climb the ladder to the very top most point and decide to try out my rifle. I snipe quite a few zombies, amazed at the accuracy of the weapon, only to hear grunts like I was hurt. I thought, there is no way a zombie could have gotten me. I was surrounded for sure, but I know I was at a safe distance from them up the ladder I had climbed. The glitchy polygons were getting annoying, so I disconnected and reconnected from the server. Don't know what I thought that would help, but at least the zombies were gone.

I head down to the roof below and look over the edge to see a survivors body. Those were the grunts I heard. I felt so bad. He had an AK on him and perhaps he was saving his own life by not shooting me in the middle of a zombie-infested airfield, but it seemed more like he was hoping I would befriend him and fight alongside him. My jubilation at finding a rifle and practicing with it brought the hordes around him, before he could climb the ladder, and he was murdered right under my nose without me knowing. I could have helped him. I had plenty of cooked steaks, bandages, painkillers, and some morphine I found in the Elektro hospital. I did not want his sacrifice to go to waste, so I grabbed the GPS off his body, left the rest in case he came back, and headed into the forest to take a break.

**TL;DR: I got you killed at the NW airfield for firing my new rifle and I'm very sorry. I took your GPS. I get lost easily... Sorry again.**  




 What happened here? I'd like to know the answer if anyone can still give it 




 I laughed when I don't feel like being happy. haha, thanks korn! 




 So much vacuuming... That's all I've been doing for awhile. I'll probably nuke it with some bug bomb like you said. It's just such a hassle. I hate these things. 




 Thanks for the advice, I'll probably try that. Will it work the same if they're bed bugs? Or do I need to do something different? 




 Girlfriend found a stray cat on the side of the highway and we took it in, killed the fleas on it but not before it was too late. I'm not getting bitten but she wakes up with bites every time. Any way to kill the fleas in the mattress? If the only way is through professional help, I'll do it.  




 I picked up camo, put it on, then decided I shouldn't have grabbed it from this guys tent, so I put it back. I still looked like I was wearing it. Is that one of the bugs? 




 I was just playing in a server for about an hour in Elektro, and decided I wanted to go find a new server. When I load back up, I load in Cap Golova with the starting inventory. What happened? 




 This is a great reply! I appreciate the information. I'm looking forward to the new additions to the game 




 Thanks man! I'm new to the game, so it's nice to know this kind of thing! 




 Care to explain? 




 It's wild how DayZ does that to people, but I completely understand. I was very frustrated when I posted this. I'll still play, because the gathering of resources and the feeling of accomplishment is amazing, we just had an unfortunate situation where my buddy had something to do IRL, so we had to hurry through main towns to the rendezvous. It won't happen again. 




 I started 4 days ago. My fear of zombies is so great I was too crippled to play the first three days. Those first moments consisted of me finding a hatchet, but being too afraid to approach a zombie. Being too afraid to enter the woods. Being too afraid to enter towns. Basically, the coast was my sanctuary. By the fourth day, I found myself on the far West side of the island, near Zelenogorsk, with one fellow survivor.

After 30 minutes of running towards the north western edge of Zelenogorsk to find a lake that we were told would be there, I happen across a truck. This truck belonged to no one. It was spawned, missing two tires, no engine, and an empty fuel tank and damaged hull. We spend the next two hours moving back and forth between Zelenogorsk, the lumber yard, and the location of our truck, finding the necessary materials to repair the vehicle. When we finally finish, I'm armed with an Enfield, he a shotgun, and our truck houses our high quantities of sodas, cans of food, and essentials, like bandages. It also held our M4A3 and a CZ 550. This truck was sanctuary. We made the decision to rendezvous with two other friendlies at the far Northeastern edge of the map, where they had no vehicle and wanted to be transported.

After 2.5 long hours, we hop in our truck and begin the arduous, treacherous journey. After successfully navigating all the way to the final town on the map just before our destination, we're ambushed, the driver dies instantly, and I smash my face into the dash when the truck crashes, killing me.

It literally destroys any chance of me enjoying this game knowing that, no matter what you do, everyone on DayZ is evil. After playing for so long, being at 12,000 blood, to die in a split second, it will never seem worth it. I thoroughly enjoy this game, but why can't anyone work for their own things? There are plenty of vehicles on the map. We spent hours fixing up our old truck. Whoever that was in Krasnostav today, on server US 1832, I will never stop playing until you are dead. 




 It might depend on the material. Calc 3 for me was literally the 3D version of Calc 2, minus the series stuff. Two was by far the hardest, but it was nothing compared to Linear Algebra.. 




 I snipe a lot, and it's sometimes easier with the ACOG because there isn't a very large scope sway like with the powered optics. 




 I meant hoards of zombies, sorry about that. And stepppes, there's no need to be an asshole here, I'm stating what I would like in a game, my opinion. That's why it's an opinion. Don't talk to me about looking stupid when you can't even type sentences properly. 
























 Thanks onotix, my friend suggested that, but I felt like we should do it ourselves. We work well enough together to fix our own mistakes so the RRF can help some other poor soul. Good advice though! 




 I haven't ran into scripters yet (that I know of), thank god. I would probably just stop playing if I did! That would be so frustrating! 




 It did sound like you were attacking me, and I apologize for fighting back, I was still frustrated by the game. Yes, good thing I know now, won't leave home without it! It probably was a proximity thing. I'll be as cautious as possible next time.

I think the difference between us on point 2 is that I play in empty servers every chance I get. I, unlike most people, prefer to play a zombie survival game rather than a bandit survival game, because I sincerely believe humans won't be murdering each other in the apocalypse but trying to stick together. We read somewhere online that certain vehicles were vanishing on certain versions of servers, and we tested it to verify it. They respawn back where you found them, without your items in them, but in the same condition (fuel, wheels, etc.) as you left them. 

"3." Okay, I admit. We were virtually making out... We'll stop that...

I haven't learned the aggro ranges for zombies when it comes to sight yet. It seems a little uneven at times so I prefer to hide rather than walk through towns.

All in all, have an upvote for giving me advice. I'm no longer frustrated so I can take your advice willingly and not feel like you are disagreeing just to disagree. Thanks biscuit! 




 I really enjoyed this post. It's always a pleasure to see into someone else's mind so profoundly. I really appreciate it. 




 1. Yeah, didn't know what Morphine was at this point. Never had to use it until those moments. I was in third rounding the corner, and he happened to be at the corner of the door right as I turned it. It didn't have to do with my cautiousness.
2. I disagree about the searching the outer woods. I never do it, and most of the players I ever see are playing in cities or the inner woods. I'm not stupid enough to hide it in the inner woods near cities. We don't play on highly populated servers anyway. The bus wasn't stolen, it vanished because of the known glitch.
3. We stick close to each other so we know where each other is located, and we role play. We were walking down a thin alley that didn't have much room to move around. Your argument is invalid. We don't play PVP anyway.

There is no reason to ever crawl unless you're role playing or goofing off.

I 100% disagree with this. I usually role play, so yes I will be crawling, but even if I'm not, it's usually the only way to go through a town during the day without being seen by a zombie.

Finally, we play the game to make it feel real. Killing myself and respawning is stupid and not enjoyable. If my leg is broken, I have to have my buddy come back to get me. 




 The only time in my post that I crawled was the one time leaving the building, and the other times were when my LEG WAS BROKEN. lol Can't really do much about that... 




 I like everyone here! To OP and the guy with a lot of numbers in his name (is that from lost? I don't watch it...) why did you name your cats Dexter? Mine has claws and made my friend bleed pretty badly once. Hence, Dexter! 




 Day one, I'm doing fine, enjoying myself with a buddy. Have quite a few cooked steaks, good enough weapons. We're in a barn, and when we're ready to leave, I crouch walk out the door (no zombie sounds at all), and one appears around the corner right when I exit and when he turns to me my leg is instantly broken. Luckily buddy killed him, but it took an hour to get to a place that had morphine (we were near the sobors, and guess what, no morphine anywhere).

Day two, find a bus, go hide it in a very, very remote area, and when we come back, it's gone. If someone took it, that's fine, but the area was remote enough where it seemed like it just vanished because of how the game works.

Day three, crouch walking with a buddy, skirting the left side of a small building, him on my left, and all of a sudden I die from what I assume was him pinching me against the wall. We were hardly moving, and I was probably at 10,000 health, good on everything. I just died instantly.

Same day, a bit after I respawn from the above death, I'm crawling through a doorway (forgive me for being ignorant to this happening) and I break my leg somehow. Crawling straight through it mind you, not trying to turn or anything. Friend is all the way up at the NW airfield, and has to run the 10,000 meters to get to me and administer morphine. I was crawling towards the Cherno hospital (spawned near Elektro, made it to the southwest end of Cherno before I broke my leg). He beat me to it.

Hours of games lost because of random broken legs. Needless to say, first priority every day now is having 20 morphine in my bag at all times.

**TL:DR - Break my legs and die randomly from the environment acting unnaturally. This being addressed in the standalone?**

PS - I love this game, and I hate to complain. But I want to play it in relative peace, and these bugs make me afraid to move anywhere close to my buddy, buildings, etc. 




 Mine too! 




 I truly appreciate this reply. It is advice I will not take lightly. I might take you up on the offer to message you as well. Your last sentence really does hit home. I appreciate you giving me the opportunity to see into the mind of someone who is going through this, since she won't allow it. 




 Heh, that was adorable, I do feel a bit better now! 




 You have shed a lot of light on my situation. I'm on the other side of things, the one who was broken up with. I'll assume you're right and leave her to figure things out for herself. I feel helpless not being able to do anything to help, but that's the problem with depression I guess. Thanks for inadvertently helping me out happyvocal. 




 My girlfriend, well, exgirlfriend, just broke up with me because she was in your same boat. I hate to ask your advice, but I feel like you have wisdom. If I stay calm with the situation and just be there for her, will she eventually let me back in? It sounds like that's what you would have done. 




 http://i.imgur.com/cKHdV.png

75 kills until the F2000 removes the FAMAS from my top. I use CQB weapons for everything! 




 Ha yeah. My friend who was in my OP just said to transfer them to Black. He did the same with his, to white. You don't have to catch pokemon and trade if you do it like that. I just want to keep my prized collection.  




 TexasAndroid mentioned a similar thing. I already own Diamond, so I'll probably do that. Thanks for the suggestion! 




 I didn't know you could hold them all in Diamond! I have Diamond, so I might go catch 1000 pidgeys. That would be a good solution. I own at least one of every generation aside from Gen 1 where I own them all. As soon as BW2 come out, that might satiate our desire to play, but honestly none of the games compare to HG/SS in my opinion. It might just be my nostalgia playing tricks on me though. 




 Losing those great pokemon is terrible... I have a Haxorus on Black, my pride and joy, so I feel like I can't delete it. 




 I would shahaahahahhahaha (close enough?) but I love how well it worked with the DS touchscreen. It wouldn't be the same :( 




 Hah, I know how that is... I want to do that, but my friend and I usually do this really nerdy thing where we both start over at the same time and, while taking our time, we move along the routes at the same pace. Which means we can't start over at different times. I'm honestly tempted to just buy another copy at this point! haha 




 Thanks! You know what I'm talking about... Some of those evolution conditions are just insane. We can't get Purugly because we both got Platinum, and it's only on Diamond or whatever. It's just silly how they did that. We wanted to get everything ourselves too, so we never used the international trading system thing. I will be buying the new games, but SS had the best interface imo. Transferring pokemon in boxes with the touch screen? WHY REMOVE THAT? 




 I want to play again so bad... But I was so close. We both were. We need maybe 30 more Pokemon to complete the National Dex, but they're the stupid ones like Spiritomb or the ones you can only evolve after you have fed them skittles on Route 40 at Sunrise while holding twelve ethers in your backpack. Should we leave our games as they are, monuments to hours of hard work and determination, or should we allow ourselves to experience the joy of starting the best games out of the series over again?

Btw, we have no shinies, but I got the Pokerus, and we have the code-only ones like Mew, and we also have the ones that you have to work for like Feebas. 




 Gif is pronounced "jif" though!

But anyway, this is awesome. Make more fucking dumb things please! 




 Thanks for everyone's replies. I'm on PS3 unfortunately so I can't upgrade my system, but I will definitely try reinstalling my system game data. Thanks for the post BeyondCR. Hopefully we'll see some improvement in the meantime. 




 I'm not looking to start a riot, just so you know. I was just searching the internet to try to find any link where DICE stated they know the problem exists. It is game breaking for me, and I would like to know if they plan on doing anything about it or not. If anyone has any links I can read it would be awesome! Thanks! 




 This will probably be buried, and may not even be the right place to ask, but how would I go about joining the team in my future? I'm a 20 year old student working for an Aerospace Engineering degree, wanting to do what you guys do. Am I on the right track? 




 Target accepts returns on Halloween costumes. Returned mine Novermber 1st. It was probably $20.  




 Thanks a lot, I'll look into it! 
























 TL:DR Guy thinks he is the boss because he has awesome gear. I am actually the boss because I give no fucks.
I win dayz!

I was dying from this. I have yet to kill another survivor, and I don't plan on it. However, if a big-headed bandit comes rolling in, I'll do Chernarus a favor. I enjoyed your story, write more if you have any more good ones!

I have an M4A3 CCO, 21 mags, and a Ghillie Suit. I'm stocking up mags for my friends. This game sucks for 85% of the time, running back and forth, but for the other 15% it definitely delivers! 




 Temperature isn't active as far as I know, but if you swim long enough you can catch a cold apparently. You have to take antibiotics to counteract that, which are apparently quite rare.

If it makes you feel any better, I left my vehicle hidden among some trees the other day, and ran up the hill a ways to log out for the night. When I logged back in, I spawned standing in the vehicle, with a broken leg, and when I tried to move backwards I instantly died. The game has it's bugs, but I think we can still enjoy it! Just learn what the bugs are, and try to steer clear of them, like driving an ATV over a bridge. That is also apparently instant death haha 




 First of all, the pain indicator is when your character goes into shock. That wears off after 5 minutes and doesn't go away until then. Shakiness is pain which can happen from a lot of things, like a broken leg or just being hit by a zombie. Take painkillers to shop the shakes. You can be bleeding without needing painkillers, and you can be in pain without bleeding. Just make sure you're not bleeding first, then take care of everything else.

Second, vehicles are very buggy. Your tractors seem to be the worst I've heard. Buses and cars can run over fences without really taking any damage. General rule of thumb for me, if you can't fit through a town without hitting something, go around it through the grass. Good luck bru_tech 




 Listen, I understand where you're coming from, trust me, I do, but I've helped many people escape from abusive relationships, and I promise you that I'm aware of when they're occurring. I'm not blinded by love or anything. I completely believe that depression is the main difference here, and it completely derails any correlations. I can't explain it any better than this, I wish I could. 




 If she wasn't suffering from depression, I would agree, but I know she isn't trying to hurt me. And I'm not hurt because of it. I appreciate your concern though 




 I understand what you're saying, but I can tell it doesn't hurt her, it just confuses her. She seems to come around every so often and be a little more accepting but it takes time. If at any point I see that it truly hurts her, I will stop. That's the last thing I want 




 Thanks for the reply. She replies with "why?" every time I tell her. Though it's painful that she won't say it back (I swear she was going to, she basically said she loved me in different words [I love everything about you, etc.]) it's something that she needs to hear, and it's the truth. I feel it, and if it takes the rest of my life to show her she is loved, it'll be a life well spent to me. I think OP, though it may be hard, needs to look at the other side and see that if someone is in love with you, truly nothing can get in the way of that. 




 I'm the one saying "I love you," and i don't plan on stopping. Call me foolish... That's what love is I guess 




 From what I've read, seen, and experienced, it does. A friend of mine has recently been hit with depression and I've been doing a lot of research reading books and talking to professionals about it so I can learn how to help her. They all claim that it is something that can be treated.

Also, for a personal experience, both my father and sister have bipolar disorder/manic depression, which though they are not exactly the same as depression, they are similar, and both are better with medication. I know relying on medication isn't always something people are interested in, but I'm willing to bet it's better than the alternative.

Stay as positive as you can and seek professional help, they're professionals for a reason! One of my favorite proverbs: "However long the night, dawn will break."

PS - Does your username refer to the book with the bear who lost his hat? That is an awesome book! 




 Sounds more like you just have a poor sense of humor, which is quite the tragedy. If I'm easily amused that's fine, I'd rather that than the opposite. 




 Rest in peace in peace? Did I miss a joke? 




 Why is everyone complaining that this isn't his house? And why is everyone saying this joke isn't funny? Jesus people. Obviously it's not his house, any halfwit could see that he is making a joke. And if you don't like the joke go elsewhere. I laughed pretty hard at this, as did the hundreds of others who upvoted it.

Let me break it down to you why it is funny. Any typical week on Reddit (maybe any day), there is a time where there are posted about three or four successful posts that follow the same paradigm. Then, like clockwork, someone posts a joke that fits the paradigm but doesn't fit the same use of the previous posts. This guy did it flawlessly, but because he is not Trapped in Reddit or Shitty Watercolor (no offense to you guys), you guys grab your pitchforks. Calm the fuck down and just laugh and move on. Normally I would too but jesus reddit, this is just annoying by now. 









 Yeah, he just kind of shrugged it off like he was enjoying. Which he probably was, since that seems to be the only reason they do it.  




 That's the thing, I didn't even have bad ~~time~~ aim. Neither of us did. I blasted him in the face, then at his feet on my second mag while my buddy fired away at his chest. Glad to know it's not that hard to kill someone ;)

Edit: Should say bad aim, not sure what happened there. 




 You people need to stop using the term "you people." It's very unfriendly...

Hacker is just a blanket term *most* people use to describe someone cheating in any way. That's at least how I used it. Scripts count as cheating.

And I live in central US, friend lives on the west coast, and another friend lives in Japan. Finding servers we can all play on has proven to be very, very difficult.

Thanks for the advice though! I too am down with cats.  




 Admittedly, it was pretty funny hearing him stand outside the door and talk to us over proxy chat, but it wasn't so funny when he came inside. We did call out friendly over the proximity chat when he first started firing, but I guess he didn't hear it! 




 His voice was way too creepy to be Superman. And he wasn't tall enough. 




 Oh I bet! I'm going to try and get into TS more. I would love to get in a game mode like this, but I can imagine the hell that would break loose when one team would move in to capture the point.. 




 While in a populated (16 or so) room, one of my buddies got shot from the tree lines, while my other friend and I were looting a small room. We closed the doors and sat and waited, planning our escape. We do not usually kill. My buddy is a hero and I'm making my way up there. 

We didn't want to engage, we just wanted to flee. Before we open the back door to leave, we hear, "Hello? Is anyone in there?" in an eerie voice. Buddy takes a knee watching the back door with a Mk.48 and I prone watching the front with an AK-74. As soon as I see him open the door I unloaded my entire mag into his head, which was perfectly lined up with my crosshairs. He runs into the room, I reload while my friend fires the Mk.48 into his chest. As he is running back out I unload on him as he says, "Okay, I'll close your door, sorry."

Friend calls out, "Hacker, back out!" So we both Alt+F4. I know you guys don't like that, but we're not losing our survivors to a hacker. Is it most likely that this guy was a hacker since he would not die with that much lead in him? I don't really know how to identify them. 




 Haven't played it often, but the few times I played it was more of a match where the tanks drove around the field circling and constantly flanking, didn't look anything like the post. But like I said, haven't played it much yet! 




 Thanks Greeny, I'll give that a shot. Do carts stop against pressure plates? I could probably place the pressure plate where the wooden block is if it works that way.

Directions: Set a cart on the track, get in the cart, hit the switch on the top block activating powered rail, get accelerated towards a downhill slope. Is there an even simpler, less obstructive way to do this? I know it's only two blocks but it is still in the way.  




 Made me think of [this.](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1049)

Which is creepy since I just read it about 15 hours ago. 




 I get one shot by the huge cannon with Squad Flak on. It definitely helps against the regular stuff, but barely. Longer respawn would be nice.
 




 I could see it working on PC, but it's outrageous on PS3. And it will never work on rush. 




 I've only seen the A-10/Frogfoot in the games so far (I'm not a jet pilot). They do okay against it. If this helps, I've used the gunner's cannon on the helicopter, it did around 27% damage after firing probably 3 or 4 full volleys against it, not missing. It takes about 6-7 stingers to take it out.

The gunship's ability to kill everything with one hit with almost perfect accuracy is what makes it so aggravating. If the pilot is on top of things (which isn't hard to be), the pilot can kill anyone at the plants, and anyone spawning trying to take it out. 




 I'm not one to complain about Battlefield often, but the AC130 is a serious problem. Don't comment if your not going to be constructive. 

"YOUR A STUPID FAGGOT NOOB."    or
"LEARN 2 PLAY"
comments are unnecessary.

The gunship is way too powerful. The splash damage is too high. It kills people inside buildings without completely obliterating the buildings. It respawns practically immediately after it is shot down. It requires at least two Stinger carriers to effectively bring it down before it annihilates your whole team, with the explosives perk. Then you need a support gunner to fill you up as soon as you're out. That takes three men out of the battle. And it can kill you when you spawn in deployment.

It needs to be either A) Nerfed to hell, B) Completely removed from the game, or C) only allowed on certain maps/game modes with a much lower spawn frequency.

Downvote me if you have to, but I want opinions. 
























 I went grocery shopping with my ex a few weeks ago and someone she knew greeted her and asked if I was her boyfriend. I quickly replied that we're just friends so she wouldn't feel bad about breaking up with me. Still feels bad man. Deep inside. 




 Awesome! Thanks for the reply. I haven't seen or heard pretty much any of the words from Rocket so I'm out of the loop. I appreciate it! 




 Am I the only one who was shocked to find that Aaron's belt has his name on it?

Great sketch regardless! Keep it up! 




 As a human that has lived with sight for at least 20 years of my life, I can confirm that the moon does in fact illuminate the world by reflecting the light of the sun. According to DayZ, the moon is a large white dot in the sky that hardly does anything else. I would understand the extreme darkness of the night during a new moon, but there would seriously be MUCH more light, even in the woods, when the moon is out.

Source: I've been outside where there are no other sources of lights (buildings, lamps, etc.) and I could see things.

Okay I know I'm joking a lot, but really. Any word on a *little* bit more light for us night walkers? 




 Haha right! Thanks! 









 That's the same thing they told Copernicus.  




 I'm sorry, I feel like I should add to the conversation now that I'm at a computer. Connor, if it's not too late, here are my suggestions, and the way my team does it:

 - First of all, if you're going to use DayZ Database, be warned, it's not 100% correct. We use it, but we're careful. Here's what you do. Go to the wiki entry ([UAZ dayz wiki](http://www.dayzwiki.com/wiki/UAZ)) of a particular vehicle, let's say the UAZ. Scroll down and look to the right under the picture where it says rarity. This tells you how many to expect. If it doesn't give you an exact number, just make an assumption. If it says rare and their are 8 spawns on the map, assume 2 or 3 exist.

 - Second, use your dayzdb map to search for the UAZ only. Hit each of the spawn points. This is slow, and not perfect, but it's a good way to check if vehicles are on the server. If you play a low pop server then they will most likely be there. There is a chance they will already be gone, but that's just something you'll have to deal with.

Another way to do it is to uncheck everything except vehicles on the dayzdb map and follow the south coast starting at kamenka, and check every spawn along the coast of Chernarus. A friend and I did that and we didn't find one until we hit Solnichniy. Finding vehicles is a slow process, just keep at it. If you think you are just absolutely not finding vehicles that should be there, it's the server. Find a new one.


Pretty reliable locations for me: Vyshnoye for the GAZ and the south, slightly west bicycle spawns. GAZ has always been there for me, and the bikes are usually there.  




 Comments like yours will be deleted because they don't answer the question or add to the topic. As I'm sure mine will too. This is what happened here. 




 Regardless, it happens every day, constantly. Many, perfectly fine questions are not allowed here because of the insanity of the rules. Just about anything can be asked of science to explain, no matter how ignorant the one asking may be.

And in regards to layman speculation, if someone posts, "I think," or "I'm speculating here," it should be perfectly fine! I mean, where do we get new science? People speculating! People ask questions without proof! This is the core of science! Obviously a comment should be deleted if it says "The Earth is definitely flat. Believe me, I'm trustworthy," DELETE IT. But come on, AskScience is killing the foundations of science, people hypothesizing.  




 I was on my phone, and it showed you replying to a reply to OP's comment. I  didn't think you were talking to OP here. This is my mistake, I apologize! 




 What the fuck? What is he supposed to ask? Everyone was removed because he didn't have proof that cats are compelled to return home? His proof is in his own fucking cat, jesus. He is asking for the scientific reason. He is asking the scientists of Reddit why *his* cats are compelled to return home, is that not enough proof? I don't understand these two subreddits anymore, AskScience and AskReddit. It's like, they're called ASK reddit, ASK science. Your rules make it nearly impossible to post anything on these subreddits anymore. I apologize for my lack of civility here, but this is outrageous. This is one of my favorite subreddits and, when there is a question I want answered, IT ISN'T ALLOWED TO BE ANSWERED. Oh well! 




 ~~He did, his post was connected to a comment op made~~

EDIT: Phone Reddit confusion, my mistake dumble! 




 It's also a perfectly fine way to respond to everyone if you don't want to individually reply 




 Is their a subreddit where these kind of posts belong? Not trying to start a fight, I'm genuinely interested. I enjoy these posts when I take the time to read them. If their is a sub I can subscribe to where they belong, that'd be great! 




 Hey, you give me hope. I'm dealing with some people who are close to me who are depressed, and seeing you have so much hope and prospects for the future cheers me up considerably. I hope everything goes great for you man! You deserve it! 









 This is amazing. If the water was not transparent enough to see the plug, I had to have someone else pull it out, because there was always *something* in the water... 




 I've had to adapt to having my door open so my cat can leave my room to use his litter box in the middle of the night.

I haven't slept since I got him. 




 I experience that crippling fear every day at school. I'm a pretty good student, and usually do fine in my classes, but this semester my grades have tanked, all because I don't understand the material at all. I'm afraid because I'm going to lose my scholarships, not be able to afford college, and then my student loan debt will start asking to be paid. My fear drives me to do better so that I'm not put in an impossible situation. Take hold of it and use it to take charge of your life. I know when you're physiologically predetermined to have a hard life, it can be almost impossible to fight through it, but I bet you can make it through the fear if you fight back. I hope I don't sound like a cheesy PSA right now... Message me if you want to talk about anything! 




 I was cracking up at your list! Especially the "strangers are people too," and the "eventually seduction" bits. Maybe I'm easily amused, but you're a funny guy. Become a world famous comedian! Easier done than said.

My friend lost 170 pounds once. He told me the thing that helped the most was watching his diet closely, but he also took thermogenics. To my knowledge they increase your internal temperature helping you burn fat faster, or something like that, and they're safe. You could definitely try those if you're looking to lose wait. Gets a lot more out of a simple treadmill work out!

There are plenty of jobs that will hire you without a high school education. They may not be glamorous, but you have options at least. I may be wrong because I live in America, but I bet Australia is a pretty good place too. You could try to work for a [video gaming company out in Australia since you have a passion for video games.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Video_game_companies_of_Australia) That link is a list of companies in Australia you could look into it. You'd probably need some coding education from a university before that pans out, but at least it's a goal!

I'm not an expert on having my life together, but I hope my words are helpful. Good luck cactuspowder! 




 You're correct.. sadly... 




 That's another thing I was thinking. As long as they don't look stupid it would be a pretty good option! 




 Plywood is already coated in Polyurethane. The liquid resin sounds like a good plan, yet I'm worried about mixing it to purity. Follow instructions though, right? haha 




 I checked out your table. It looks very smooth! The problem is the cost. I put two coats of polyurethane on this table and that took a full bottle. I don't own any tools so I would have to rent the orbital sander. Thinking ahead this may prove cheaper than my other options though, so I'll keep it in mind! 




 How much does MDF cost? And what method would I use to attach it to the desk? Nails? I haven't worked with it before. I'll look into that as a possibility, thanks! 




 Don't think "I haven't got any strengths or skills," think more, "I have the drive to learn new strengths and skills." And everyone has skills, you just need to figure out what they are. Focus on thinking of a skill that relates directly to what you're applying for. Without knowing more about you it's hard to say much else! 




 The table top is made of plywood. [This is basically what it looks like with dimensions.](http://i.imgur.com/A2MRi.jpg) The plywood is sanded enough to be smooth, but I need something smooth enough that I can write on a piece of paper on it. Any good ideas? I was thinking something like tiles, but the tiles would have to be big so the grout isn't in the way. Lighter would be nice, but not necessary. Any ideas would be great! I can take pictures of the actual desk if need be.
