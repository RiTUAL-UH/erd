 My grandfather has the same set as well. He actually just gave them to me, along with an old spokeshave. 




 Isn't this what you weird goth people wore along with ample amounts of chain? 




 Top left-hand corner anyone? 




 Nothing on this thread is really that creepy but this made me shit myself 




 It's already begun. My chin...it...it's gone. Tell everyone you can. Please. The dawn of the chin-snatchers is upon us. 




 Hahaha - "chin" as in chinchilla. However, I think you know that. 


Just kidding. I'm coming to steal your chin. Beware. We are coming for you. 




 I'm sorry you had to depart with your chin - that's a shame. But yes, they are extremely sociable and smart little creatures. I let mine run around an hor or two a day and give him plenty of chew toys. He seems to be happy. I've only had him for a couple months.
 




 Mine is just so fuzzy and little. Certainly not a threat to the paranormal.  




 If anyone/anything tries to do this to me, I'm screwed. I have a chinchilla 




 It pains me to read that your parents treated you like that. One of the better stories on nosleep, in my opinion. I hope to read more from you.  




 This was wonderfully written. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it; however,  this didn't actually happen,  did it? Excuse my naivety.  
























 I loved that hike. I did it twice in a day 




 I've had similar things happen to me. It's strange that you mention swimming lessons. I used to dread going to my swimming lessons when I was young (for some unknown reason). I remember a specific instance when I got into an argument with my parents because they forced me to go when I didn't want to. The phone then rang a couple minutes later saying the lesson was cancelled. As you said, these feelings passed as I grew up and became more confident.  




 Be my Ygritte? (before she dies) 




 Falllniven f1. I carry this with me all the time and it's my all-purpose, go to knife. A little pricey, but I'm probably never going to buy another knife. 




 Libra is my zodiac - I think it looks really cool. 




 That actually scared me 




 Video game. These should be made into a.video game. I would play it 




 Wow I completely forgot about this show. I used to watch it once in a while - why did I ever find it entertaining?  




 I've hiked Angel's Landing before. It was really beautiful. I really enjoyed it! 




 Mora Knives 




 I know you asked for books, but you should search for Paul Sellers' YouTube channel. He is very informative. I really enjoy watching him. 
























 Fuck that. I didn't even get 3 sentences in. I just got home from college last night. I'm on the toilet reading this with my front door open. 

Save me 




 After watching this movie I did some research about it. Some people actually believe the demon travels through pictures of the box. I read about people warning others to stop sharing the image, because even looking at it can act as a "portal" for lack of a better term. I just thought it was interesting.  




 It happens to me rather frequently. My first experience with sleep paralysis happened when I was around 6 or 7. I remember "waking up" and feeling very threatened (I apologize for the lack of detail as I was very young). As the feeling progressed, I tried calling out to my brother with whom I shared the room with. I immediately realized that my screams for help were inaudible. Soon after I tried sitting up with no avail. I was lying there helpless, mute, and temporarily paralyzed. It was one of the more frightening experiences of my life at the time. The next vivid case occurred about a year and a half ago. I was asleep, facing my girlfriend when I "woke up" again. This time my sleeping girlfriend's eyes opened slowly and her face became very dark. At this point I realized I was paralyzed again, and this was about the point where the panic set in. She then began to mumble quietly, yet aggressively in an incomprehensible manner (think of a double-voice synonymous with demons? . I felt an immense pressure on my neck as if I was begin stranged. This sensation lasted roughly 15 seconds and abrubtly ended when my paralysis ended, and my girlfriend smiled at me and rolled back over. After doing some research I found out that it happens to people who are under a lot of stress. I am currently an engineering student and know that I am always under a large amount of stress and anxiety.  









 I actually live outside of North Philly. Thanks for that 









 That made me so mad when I saw that. That guy was so sad when they shot his dog. I felt horrible. 




 I do this alllll the time! 




 I would pay to see Julian get his bird sucked by Lahey 




 Yeah if you mention Marijuana in any head shop around me (I live in the Philadelphia area) they get very upset 




 I - Kendrick Lamar. That song is so catchy 
























 Damn. That's powerful. 

As a lot of people previously mentioned: we are - well, most of us - too brainwashed to think otherwise. They think our government is just and righteous, and acts solely in favor of the people. That couldn't be further from the truth.

I'll get behind anyone who wants to take our country back. 




 So capitalist in your ways of thinking  




 So the last time I smoked was 4/20. I told myself I had to take a tolerance break if I wanted to get an internship for the summer. So I finally landed one, passed the drug test, and decided to celebrate this weekend after my first week of work. My buddy and I rolled 2 blunts and we packed my vape  (Arizer Solo) a couple times. I was expecting to get stoned since I haven't smoked in so long, but nothing. I barely even got high, and the "high" only lasted half an hour max. We were smoking cherry pie and it was some pretty dank stuff, but for some reason it wasn't working for me. 

Any insight would be much appreciated! 




 Hey I feel your pain. I've noticed the same trends on 9gag. Scrolling through the posts and reading comments which were initially there for my entertainment, became something unseemingly sinister. The people are mean - not just a little mean, but the truest from of the word. They revel in their bad habits of being shut-ins, and unmotivated membera.of society who wish to do nothing more than play their games and bully those who think differently than themselves.

I've decided to kill my time through books and sketching, rather than giving my thumb a workout through the toxicity of that website. 




 I'm the messy inbox, android, beer over soda, multiple alarms, cash, and "haha"  kind of person. 




 FallenS(kyrim)ouls 




 This is one of the few nosleep series I'm actually enjoying. Please update! 




 Say something like: "the prince of darkness resides here."  




 215! 




 I have one that isn't too creepy, but interesting nonetheless. 

My father came to the United States roughly 30 years ago, purchased a house, and then my mom had me shortly after. The original owner of the house was an old woman who had the house since its construction in the early 1900s. My father was a handyman and decided to construct a deck in the backyard. While he was digging the foundation for the deck, he noticed a concrete slab about 15 feet from the back of the house. It turned out to be a time-capsule the woman left for previous owners. We dug it up and sorted through the knick-knacks she left for us. Nothing too interesting or out of the ordinary; just pictures of the house from back in the day and newspaper clippings from the second world war and other important events. With the discovery,of the time-capsule came the discovery that the old woman passed away in the house. It is unknown how she passed, but we later found out she passed away in the room I sleep in now. Ever since then I started to notice strange events throughout the house. There have been a couple times where lights have turned off by themsleves, doors have closed, and have even had my clothes moved off my floor into the hamper. One instance that I will not forget was when I was alone in the house with my music playing downstairs (pretty loudly) when all of a sudden I heard a loud "ssshhh!" come from the top of the stairs. I knew it had to be her.

Never once have I felt threatened; I really feel at peace in my home. I feel as if her spirit  (if you want to make those conclusions) is that of a typical old woman. She turns the lights off when we're not in the room, closes the doors so our dogs don't make a mess of our room, picks up my dirty clothes, and even tells me to be quiet when I'm making too much noise.  




 Hey Jim - if you were to cut open a hot pocket and use it to pleasure yourself, at what temperature would you like the hotpocket to be?  
























 I spent 2 weeks in Sevilla and loved every second of it.  




 Would that just be similar to a Hell's Gate, for instance?  




 I've heard of them encountering problems with the earlier firmware, but mine is up to date. So far I'm really liking it and haven't had any problems with it.  




 What's wrong with the m80? 




 With the fossil fuels shortages occurring. I know not all fossil fuels are made from dinosaurs, but still! Pretty soon there will be nothing left. 




 Okay, great - thank you!  




 If I took took it to my bike shop how much would you say that would cost?  




 Yeah I realized that as soon as I posted the picture  




 So I just purchased a vintage Peugeot SuperSport road bike. Everything is original and in great condition given its age. I took it on a test drive around the neighborhood and noticed the brakes squeal when applied and the shifting is a bit clunky. It utilizes the older, lever-style shifters that I am unfamiliar with. I am used to riding mountain bikes and decided to switch it up and use it to travel around town. 

Being that the bike isn't new - what sort of maintenance should I perform to get it to tip-top shape? 









 And it still is? 
























 For example: I eat a lot of candy; I have such a sweet-tooth when I'm stoned. Shares yours below! 




 In elementary school I knew about 10. I'm currently 21 and only my best friend and I still play on our original accounts. 




 I got 31! I'm a robot! Finally!  




 The entire ending of Paths of Glory by Jeffery Archer was very sad. 




 The Martian - Andy Weir. It's one of the best books I've read in a long time.  




 I just finished the book. I loved every second of it. I'm embarrassed to admit, however, that I finished it in 1 day. 




 Same. In my last year of engineering and I enjoyed it. 




 Thanks, Reagan 




 Playing Halo 2 with all of my friends during sleepovers. Those were the days. 




 That thumb though 





























 D'aww shucks 




 I wish I could give you one zillion upvotes. It's really frustrating sitting in my car smoking a joint in complete darkness, worrying about who may have seen me, my smell, my eyes, the judgement - everything. Work needs to be done to make this legal throughout the whole country.  




 This what I've been saying for so long! I get stoned, chill with my friends, watch a movie or play some games, and make myself food. The worst thing that happens is I eat too many Doritos or Skittles. Essentially harmless. On the other hand, some people I know pride themselves on how much they drink, how drunk they git, and how many times they puked.

It's so backwards.  




 I love this sub so much. You guys are the best! 




 I wouldn't say 100%. I catch a lot of flak for smoking  (I'm a college student) and this surprises me. My more conservative friends can't wrap their head around the fact that I'd rather chill with some good friends and bud than go get hammered at a party.  




 I actually did research with Nike one semester and worked to develop a similar technology. It would relay every impact to a computer on the sidelines, allowing for a real-time analysis of each athlete. We were told how innovative the idea was, but when it came time to reveal our prototype and do a talk about the work behind it, nobody was interested.

Not sure why, though.  




 Dual 18650 ABS box mod with a green limited edition Royal Hunter RDA 




 No I'm on the East coast, actually; it's been downpouring all day.  









 That sounds wonderful right now.  




 Haha that sounds funny. Unless you were on the receiving end.  





























 I'm actually looking at buying a tank. I really like the convenience of not re-dripping as often. 




 I really did feel very uncomfortable and intimidated. It was upsetting that he felt the need to do that. I'm not cop-shaming or saying all cops are bad, but he didn't do anything to reverse the bad image cops already have. Little things like that make me mad. 




 I used to have an m80 with a plume veil RDA, but I sold it to a friend and now I have an ABS dual 18650 box mod with a Royal Hunter. I like it quite a bit, actually. 




 My brother is a long-time user of vapes and ejuice. He originally used it to ease himself off his chronic cigarette use, but he's now turned it into a hobby. He got me into it and I purchased a decent mod and RDA. 

I'm just wondering how many people here vape as well? 




 I do this trip two to three times a week on my way home. I stop by my local 711, pick up a lemon iced tea and a pack of Zig-Zag grape wraps. Usually the same employee is there to greet me each time I enter the store, and he remembers what I get and has the wraps waiting for me by the time I make it back to the counter with my iced tea in hand. Today, however, was different. There was a new employee this afternoon, and upon my request for the Zig-Zags, she sighed, gave me a dirty look, and took her time placing them on the counter. At this point a police officer is standing next to me paying for a coffee and a newspaper. He glances down at the counter, notices the wraps, and says to the cashier, "Do not sell those to him" in a stern, police-man voice. Now just listen to me really quick. I am your typical white kid. I have longer hair, but I usually pull it back so it looks neat and I don't come off as being a dirty hippy. I'm completely inconspicuous and have been living in the area and frequenting that 711 for as long as I can remember. Obviously someone buying blunt wraps sets off a red flag. Nobody I know buys them to actually roll their own cigars. But still! The cashier pauses, looks at the officer, smiles awkwardly, scans the wraps, and places them in the bag. He repeats himself again, "Do *NOT* sell those to him." This time you could tell he was serious. At this point the two of us are just standing in complete silence with confused looks on our faces. She hands me the bag and says the usual "Have a nice day" as I leave the store. I get in my car, pull back onto the road and notice the cop is behind me. He follows me for a good while, turning whenever I turn. I start getting a little paranoid, but know there's nothing wrong in the inherent act of purchasing the wraps; it's what I plan on doing with them  later that I don't want Mr. Policeman to see. I finally take the last turn onto my street and he continues on his route. I was more annoyed than anything during that encounter. I live in a city where it is decriminalized and not completely legal and can understand why that may have happened, but for the officer to tell the cashier not to sell them to me made me upset. What would you guys have done if you were put in a similar situation?

Hoping for the best future for the ents and their trees. 




 Was...was he okay?  




 Buy a good sharpstone. Mine was $50, it's anodized, and it's on the bigger side ( I think 2.5-3"). I've had it for over a year and I use it very frequently. It's the only grinder my buddies and I use so it gets plenty of use. It feels nice in the hand, is very smooth when griding, and I definitely recommend it.  




 Indica puts me right to bed and it doesn't let me enjoy my high. I prefer sativa 




 Sharpstones! 




 My last year as undergrad ME 
























 I used to smoke almost daily, but only a joint a day. I stopped for a little for finals week and school and began experiencing insomnia. I'm not sure if this was because I stopped smoking or I was stressed because of finals. Either way: everything in moderation.  




 Just to confirm:

I Googled it and the same thing showed up for me. Thanks for that.

Cheers. 




 I get mad at that, too. I also get upset when people hold the bong/joint/blunt/bowl/etc and don't pass it. It bothers me when I'm passed a roll and there's 6 inches of ash hanging off and then it lands on me or in my car. It's annoying smoking with paranoid people because then I get paranoid. I also dislike when people don't know they're limits and then you're forced to babysit someone who is having a panic attack.
 




 I dream quite a bit actually. I have chronic night terrors, too. 




 I'm looking for a smaller stash box that I can just throw in my bag and go. Any suggestions?  




 Necessity. 
I'm a college student and worked as an RA for a year (shh don't tell my supervisor) and had little money left over after purchasing my little supply. I also didn't want to be going around with a piece and obviously couldn't smoke indoors. I opted to going with the blunt/joint route. It's cheap, simple, and when you finish your sesh you don't have any incriminating paraphernalia on your person. Albeit rolling is much harder than packing a bowl, but I learned to roll well in only a little while. I suggest starting out with blunts or wraps as I feel they are easier to roll than papers - but it's certainly a personal preference. 

Definitely a good stoner-skill to know! 




 Can you fit blunts in there? If so, I'm buying it right now 




 Whatever you like. I've been listening to a lot of Trevor Hall recently. Really chill and relaxing. 




 Music is the best thing while high. Just enjoy yourself!  




 I'm sorry I wish I could tell you haha. I have two coils and I think it's 26ga. I'm new to this and I still have a lot to learn! 




 The first couple times I smoked nothing happened; it became frustrating for me. I wanted to know what being high was like. I then started to get high and understood what it was like. 

Just be careful when you first start out. You may see that people smoke more than you. Don't worry, that's okay; it isn't a contest. Being *too* high is a thing and it isn't good if you're first starting out. I also suggest doing it somewhere safe around good company (or alone. There's nothing wrong with smoking alone). Just enjoy yourself. Welcome to the community and happy toking!
