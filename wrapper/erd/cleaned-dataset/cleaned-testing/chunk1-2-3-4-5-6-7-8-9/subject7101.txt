 it's running a bit better but still pretty bad lag in some parts

they need to fix it so there is no lag runner games like these can't have stuttering/lag issues makes it unplayable  




 lag has always been a issue with the game but i ever had it as badly as i am now after the latest update

horrendously lagging like a son of a bitch causing me to die a lot (even losing a 250 combo just before the boss!!!)

i'm on android  galaxy S5 




 would be nice

i can say though top 999 needs a score of at least 2.5/3 million 




 friend requests pile up with no option to reject and no option to remove current friends

seems like something that should of been put into the game a long time ago
 




 noticed that after i posted i checked my bulletproof and it needs 600 to get to the 5th star

complete waste of ISO 




 just noticed that the bronze medal is 50 ISO-8 (100-999th place)

you need to get over 2 million to get it though i got 1.7 million yesterday and made it 740th place by the morning i was down to about 1100-1200th place

quite hard for me to get more than 2 million with a 28 multiplier but at least the chance to win a lot is ISO is back 




 3.4 million for me in this event placed me in 14th place 




 it's a waste of ISO-8 IMO but if you have the money to burn it will be at the bottom of the screen if you don't have the necessary card for it

if i'm not mistaken it's like 200 ISO-8 to rank up a six star spider.. that much ISO-8 could buy you 16 discount premium portals 




 most games like this don't do it for the powerups especially when the vials have no other use (as of yet)

the game already makes you use premium currency to buy the portals which is the most important thing to upgrade your spiderman..

you have to use a lot of it if you're unlucky like me and never get the spider you need 




 that one actually sounds good but i don't think i've ever got a ben riley one

lost many combos the extra 4 seconds sounds pretty good 




 starting with 10x counter is pretty useless.. using a spider that gives +1 on near miss or +1 when you kill a enemy over the course of even a short run will give much more then the 10 from the beginning. 




 they shouldn't have a event portal as a prize if it isn't ready from the beginning of the event

often if you unlock it before it's ready you don't get it when it is 




 my favourite 2 are the +1 near miss and +1 for enemy kill (battle damaged and bulletproof spiders)

i find for me they are the only 2 that are worthwhile and can build a huge combo

 




 got to the point where i bought the 80,000 vial upgrade only to realise if you want to upgrade it again you need to spend ISO-8

what is the point of vials if you can't upgrade the powerups all the way? literally that's all the vials can buy (except when you spend 500 when you want to waste a useless spiderman to add more xp to another)

why couldn't they of just made them even more expensive (like 160,000 vials then 250k or whatever.. 




 i watched a few youtuve videos of the gameplay and it just look like a updated 2013

also the engine sounds are terrible and sound nothing like the real 2014 cars 




 didn't get my event portal after getting 20k in the event before it finished.. (event portal was available when i got 20k)

the game has been really glitchy lately 




 pretty sure that's what we're stuck with now.. 

i'm in the same boat i'll get a score good enough to stay within the bronze medal then leave it for the day 




 i think they should people you up against people of a similar level atm it's just the level 90's winning everything 




 always wondered why they don't give 1-3 clams when you level up in the game 




 they changed the rank required for silver medal it's now 10-99 (bronze is 100-9999) not only impossible for those with lower multipliers but a bit unfair on people who get high scores that get screwed over with a bronze medal

i think they increased it because it's 50 ISO-8 but it's hard to achieve
i wouldn't mind if it was less ISO-8 so more people could actually have a chance to earn it 









 i wish it was only at the beginning for me i've lost at least 3 100 combos in the last few days and always before one of the bosses since it just doesn't recognise some of the near misses 




 is anyone else having issues with near misses? for me it doesn't register some of the near misses which has caused me to lose 100+ combos i'm even incredibly close to the objects when this happens

only happens a few times during the runs but it's incredibly frustrating to lose a combo because of it 




 think i know the part you're talking about it's got me a fair few times 




 whenever i die in this game it's always on the easiest part of the track.. like jumping to early or late or going for the near miss combo and just screwing it up

when the track is full of stuff dropping and enemies everywhere i never seem to screw it up only on the easy parts. 




 i hate the level up system.. either pay iso-8 or wait til you get the same card and then waste 2 similar cards to level up and you have to do that EACH TIME!!!!! obviously geared to get you to pay for iso-8

because of this there are people with level 90 spiders already (or they hack) and they just own the leader board because of the score multiplier.. you just can't compete with them if you have a 7 score multiplier  




 yer i got 3rd in the event and won him.. going to be a royal cunt to rank him up though 




 it will be the death of the game when a large majority of people who don't want to pay $100's of dollars to rank up spiderman stop playing 




 i hate the rank up system in the game and have been playing nothing but events lately because i've hit a road block needing a level 35 spiderman to continue.. 

even that sucks because there is a few people with level 90 spiderman that i have no chance to match their scores of 1-3 million with my level 30 spiderman with a much lower score multiplier 

game is massively geared to get you to pay for iso-8 for instant rank up or to get the right premium spiderman to continue 




 it's the worst rank up system.. so clearly designed to get you to spend money on iso-8

would take months to save up enough of it to buy the premium cards and get them for ranking 




 they should have a event that's based on how far you get not the score 




 been playing them a lot recently as it's all i can do and probably the best way to make any currency

hard to get in the top 10.. people with scores of a million or more i'm lucky to get 250k before stupidly stuffing up on something easy 




 downloaded it the other day it was fun at first but when you get up to the missions that require a level 35 spiderman the game gets ridiculous

the amount of iso-8 you need to level up is ridiculous and you got to be lucky to get 4-5 of the same premium card and another 2 to level them up

obviously geared to get people to pay otherwise it would take months to even get enough (other endless runner games aren't this bad)

takes away from the fun of the game when you hit a roadblock like this

  




 i hardly ever get battery drops so i have to wait the 4 hours for one zap and in that time he appears on more buildings

got like 3 in my town right now (one on a building i need) and just not getting any batteries

really don't want to spend clams getting them because they are a bit overpriced.

how often do you guys get battery drops? 




 not even close although i haven't been playing much recently.. i'm finding it more of a chore to unlock him then fun and it's only going to get worse when higher level characters are released. 




 they are a bunch of idiots 




 ferrari staying out 




 i think ricciardo will win this one just have a feeling hamiltons tyres won't last and he'll pit or ricciardo will get him with the fresh tyres.. 




 i have a feeling Hamilton will have to pit again 




 those clouds look pretty evil i wonder if rain will hit before the end 




 i wonder if the conspiracy theorist hamilton fans will claim the spin was because of sabotage of the brakes they seem to think everything bad that happens to his car is sabotage 




 they are cold because he had to start from the pits 




 3 weeks really isn't that long between events, if you don't use clams you have to grind them out collecting whatever and to me the game is becoming more of a chore then fun

they should space big events out by at least 3 months and have smaller updates like the toy boxes or something similar to fill the gaps between 




 i hate when games put big events out so soon, events need to be spaced out so you don't get tired of the game and this one most likely will be similar to the last with collect x to get y or spend a zillion clams to get it now..

too many events so soon and you get burned out on the game (especially since many are probably still unlocking stewie or trying to get the toy boxes) 




 does it really surprise you? they are desperate for ratings with how shit the show has been over the last few years 




 i thought they said it was a iconic or great character that will bite the bullet.. rabbi krustovsky is not iconic or great and has only been in like 10 episodes i think..  




 there really isn't much premium content worth buying and most is horribly overpriced

i'm just glad they have been giving some out for free in recent prize boxes. 




 at first i liked the collect x item for skin etc but now it's getting ridiculous especially for what you have to collect to get stewie.

i realise some people would collect it quick then be waiting for the next item but anyone that can only play this game once or so a day etc would be put off in having to grind so much to unlock a character.   




 ever since the moon idol event i've been getting constant freezing.. the game doesn't crash it just freezes every 30 or so seconds for a few seconds then starts again

anyone had this happen (i'm using a S3 but it was fine before that first event) 




 now stewie is around the corner i regret wasting so much money on the prize boxes during both events.

i have a feeling it will be like when you unlock Tricia and you'll have to unlock the land around the funhouse first before even repairing it which could be 50k upwards.
 




 whilst i am playing the game will freeze for a few seconds then go back to normal then it will do it again 20-30 seconds later.. it doesn't crash completely just freezes and starts again

only started happening during the event.. anyone else getting this?

i'm using a galaxy S3 




 yes they have stopped for me 




 anyone know a fix for this? game just constantly freezes for a few seconds then goes back to normal literally every minute or two only crashes a few times but it's annoying as hell.

only started happening during event (galaxy s3)
 




 is anyone else having this issue? i'm on android and when i try to buy a box of coins the purchase confirmation screen shows tank of clams for $106

all the other options work fine just that one isn't right. 
























 watching a old video clip and bringing someone back as a hologram after death is completely different 




 they didn't give the ok to be used as a hologram after death it's different from old recordings and clips etc.. 

the family giving the ok is not the same.. let people rest in peace there is no need for holograms 




 they are the ones that would have to ok it in the first place they could sue otherwise 




 enough with these holograms!!! first 2-pac then Micheal Jackson and now Senna

i can't support this because they are dead they get no say in it (sure the family or whatever gives the ok but not the actual person who obviously can't)

let them rest in peace 




 it's like they think Ferrari is sitting around not upgrading their car at best they'll be able to compete with williams 




 if i'm not mistaken they have like 10 tokens left.. how much do you think they will improve this years car?

will they be able to match Mercedes on pace rather than adopting an alternate strategy

Raikkonen said in an article after yesterdays race that he thinks this will happen.. hopefully it's true 




 cheers.. these streams are pretty shit today keeps cutting out 




 Renault provided a gigantic turd of an engine 




 what did he say my stream keeps screwing up 




 i don't expect it to be any better next year 




 got a feeling rosberg will take hamilton out 




 yep it will be another hamilton rosberg vettel podium unless the mercs chew the tyres like Malaysia  




 hard to pass cars when the car is powered by a gigantic turd 




 massa has electrical problems? 




 he's using any excuse he can think of 




 going to guess it will be a Hamilton Rosberg Vettel podium 




 get used to this podium it will be like this all year 




 it was boring and a sign of how the rest of the year will be

some teams are struggling to even finish a race.. Rosberg doesn't have what it takes to challenge Hamilton, the Ferrari's have improved but not enough to pose a threat to the Mercedes and we have yet to see a good vettel kimi battle because something always fucks it

williams not good enough to keep up with the ferrari so we can expect the same results each race 1.hamilton 2 rosberg 3 vettel 4 kimi 5-6 bottas/massa
 




 so for the rest of the year it's going to be 1. hamilton 2. rosberg 3. vettel 4. kimi then the williams 5-6 and so on 




 another boring race.. Malaysia probably going to be the only interesting race of the year if it stays like this 




 it's on of my favourite maps what i'm saying is it's annoying to have it voted for several times in a row or only have 1 or 2 different maps inbetween playing it again 




 its like some people just can't get enough of it that they have to constantly vote for it a gazillion times

just played a few rounds of casual for fun and dust2 was voted for 3 times (twice in a row) happens every day

maps been out for like (15 years?) you would think people wouldn't want to play it every 5 seconds

 




 he'll be kicking himself for it the ferrari is vastly improved from last year and McLaren is pile of shit 




 alonso will be kicking himself now for leaving ferrari.. McLaren look like they will have there worst season ever and the ferrari seems a lot better then last year 




 this had better not be how the rest of the season is utterly boring race 




 the issue is the crap engine in his redbull he'll be lucky to get a win this season with that Renault turd powering his car 




 time for redbull to get a different power unit the Renault is basically a gigantic turd 




 the redbull seems to be a powered by a pile of shit 




 it's going to be a Mercedes dominated year again so i think it's going to be pretty boring all year round 




 even so he really shouldn't discuss/show things like that in the first place as it's a review

they are not supposed to reveal plot twists and endings 




 they need to make the movie appeal to both rooster teeth fans and neutral people (who may not even know what rooster teeth is)

if it's just a movie full of RT references and in jokes it won't be successful  




 this is more then 5000 people i think it's grouping all  players together

saw a post on the gameloft forum where someone tested a low score and got 29,434th place

this happened on a event before and they never fixed it 




 was going to post something similar unless you run a ben riley you are almost certain to lose your combo in the high rise area

hate it with a passion 




 well that sucks 




 just noticed the new event so had a quick go  got 1.6 million on my first try (died because of a stupid mistake)

i thought that would be good enough for a decent position that i could work on later.. nope 360th place don't even want to kow what the top 50 scores would be

1.6 million in previous events would of got into the top 100 no problems seems now you got to get over 4-6 million to place well 




 that's why they should come up with something to keep people occupied that isn't 30 day long events one after the other

they can't keep this pace up forever 




 they are far too greedy for that they would much rather release several 200 clam items every event so people have to buy several $100 clam options to have everything

personally i wouldn't spend $100 on a mobile app even if it gave unlimited clams i play this game for 1-2 minutes maybe 2-3 times a day.. not the same as spending $100 on a PC/console game that will give me 100's of hours of immersive gameplay  




 i uninstalled simpsons because of it family guy might go soon as well as it's just getting tiresome if you want anything decent for the game without paying the ridiculous prices they charge 




 it will be another copy paste event you can't make something unique when you are put events out one after the other 




 got another score of 2.4 million luckily this one registered so i'm in the running for the 50 iso 8 prize 




 i'm a little burned out on this game atm

king butt, comic con which went for 40 days then Halloween and now american dad to me that's far too many events in a short period of time

once this one finishes they'll likely have a Christmas one as well

game needs some downtime between events maybe release a new district or have smaller weekend things like they used to do not month long events one after each other 




 this only seems to happen to me on my best runs and ones i use ISO-8 to continue on

i just scored 2.6 million on the daily run and game decides not to register it i even used 6 ISO during the game

game is more than happy to take the ISO and not register the score

seriously getting over the glitches this fucking game has (not to mention the lag)

restart of phone etc isn't making the game register the new score

don't have screenshots because i shouldn't have to take them after every run in case this BS happens. 




 a lot of people make far more vials then they can ever spend

i average 800 on a bad run and over 1000 on a good run playing 5-10 times a day you end up with a lot more vials then you can ever spend

they should add a mystery box for like 100k vials that you can win ISO or portals or something 




 this happens to me a lot and it's annoying 




 progress rewards are 2500 vials and 1 iso 3500 vials 2 iso 10 iso and last prize premium portal and 10 ISO

the entire event (and leaderboard) is based on how many enemies you can kill.. 

doens't matter if you score 20 million it's based on the amount of enemies killed

not sure who gives the bonus if there even is one... i've got 80 enemies so far and i'm in 486th place don't play often enough to score higher in events like these 




 i try to use my highest level spiders with a bulletproof as the main one due to the abilities of near miss and extra points from enemy kills.. 

my multiplier is 33 and if i have a good run i can get around 2.5-3 million average runs if at least 1 million

other then that it's just down to luck.. only use ISO to continue a run if you are sure you can get a higher score for a good prize otherwise it's just a waste 




 the new event didn't register my score of 4.7 million to the leader board

it knows i got 4.7 million because each time i die it says best score of 4,7 million but it never went on the leader board fucking pissed me off

all scores i get know go up but just not my best one 




 the event isn't registering my scores got 4.7 million but it didn't register

http://i57.tinypic.com/166zync.png

fuck this game has been really glitched recently

edit-- getting a message leaderboard data unavailable that might be why it's not showing 




 it designed to make you want to spend money to get it quicker. otherwise you just have to wait and get them from premium portals which all depends on luck

just score enough to get them on the daily leader board or try to get 50 iso-8 and buy the discount ones or get them in events

no way in hell i'm spending 800 ISO to rank up my 5 star bulletproof one 




 i was thinking about this because right now in issue 4 it's already requiring higher then level 70 to continue

the later issues will probably go higher then level 90 as they already have a 7 star in the game

hopefully they release all of them as 7 star otherwise it will be a pain in the ass to rank one from 1 to 7 star 




 yep changed back on andriod as well although i somehow managed to get the bronze prize yesterday and got 50 iso-8

i don't even remember making a 2.5 million run in unlimited mode but apparently i did and it was enough for 50 iso-8 




 android daily rewards have changed again no more premium portal

the 4th price (1000-9999) is 5 ISO-8..

sucks when it's 12 for a discount portal.. i relied on that portal as i've been a bit low on ISO lately (even though it gave me spiders i didn't need)

if i'm lucky i'll be able to get 8 or 9 ISO a day 









 it's hard to say what it is as the number needed would increase everyday as more people get better spidermen

the premium portal prize 1000-9999 used to only need a score of 300k now it's increasing to 450-500+ 
























  they are hoping for 5-6 seconds a lap which is a massive difference on what they do now 




 yet another thing they will have to address as well as these changes

people just illegally stream even though the quality is terrible 




 they may of been leaving for years but it got worse after 2014 the noise is only one part of it

every article i've read on these changes is full of people happy refueling is coming back and that there will be louder cars

people want faster louder cars

 




 you may be happy with it but a lot of people are not, it's more important to draw the fans back that are put off by the current state of f1 and possibly draw new fans in 




 so many people don't want these changes but guess what the biggest complaints about f1 are slow cars, less noise etc etc

a lot of fans has been driven away from the sport these changes will hopefully bring them back and attract new ones

you can't keep it the way it is especially when track attendance and tv audiences are dropping it's the whole reason they had this meeting in the first place 




 the entire reason they are bringing this back is a LOT of fans miss the spectacle that f1 used to be

you may think it's for 8 year olds but clearly a lot of people have been driven away from the sport due to the slower cars and less noise or they wouldn't be having this meeting to change the sport

getting those fans back and attracting news one will keep the sport alive not keeping it the way it is and have track attendance and tv audiences die off anymore then it currently is 




 if  the racing was good they wouldn't of had this meeting to introduce these changes

people are moving away from the sport in droves 




 a lot of people are no longer interested in F1 these changes could be a good thing and attract more fans to the sport

leave it the way it is and it will die off 




 they had to take a pay cut a few years back they used to get around 440k an episode 




 they will probably recast them because that's too many characters to retire you lose a lot of development like lenny+carl smithers+burns bart+skinner

however people are used to what they sound like since they have heard them for over 20 years so suddenly changing voice actors will sound weird 




 considering what they pay them it's not that bad of a request that they be there when they need them they get over $250,000 an episode 




 they will probably recast them because that's too many characters to retire you lose a lot of development like lenny+carl smithers+burns bart+skinner

however people are used to what they sound like since they have heard them for over 20 years so suddenly changing voice actors will sound weird  




 i think Ricciardo is given more credit then he deserves due to last year.. his wins came when Mercedes had problems and safety cars

i want to see him in a good car for a few years to see if he can consistently pull off results like that or if it was just a one off due to special circumstances 




 i don't like it when you know which team has won the championship 5 races into the season 




 no one is passing at the front because the teams are so far apart that the only action is in the midfield

f1 won't survive for years and years if this continues 




 you can since no one has seen gameplay yet and the game is far from being released

even with all the missing features it could still turn out to be a good game 




 it looks good but i'm just not sure of the timeline

it's weird seeing a Industrial Revolution Assassins creed game with trains etc but i guess after all the others from earlier timelines they had to finally do more modern

 




 f1 isn't going to survive if the only good action is teams fighting for scraps

people want to see a real challenge for the championship not know that one team has already won 5 races into a season because they are so dominant 




 they have to do something or F1 will die a slow painful death 




 Mercedes Ferrari and Williams drive in a procession whilst the other teams fight for scraps... that's if red bull torro rosso and mclaren can even finish the race

many other recent years have had better racing then this 




 f1 has been a procession for years instead of red bull leading it now it's Mercedes

Hamilton Rosberg Vettel Kimi Bottas Massa this has been basically every race so far and likely for the whole season just switch the names around when someone different happens
 




 i know, they need to change it though so they can at least push for a few more laps then they currently can

that way you can still have strategy with tyres but at least get some more racing 




 the races are getting more boring now with tyre management and DRS

no one pushes anymore because they need to save tyres it takes a lot of the fun out of the sport 




 they should make the tyres last a little longer then they do not the whole race long but enough so they can push for a few more laps then they can now

 




 he's just as good as Ricciardo 




 let them leave getting sick of the crying from them... they dominated for 4 years and now want to quit because they haven't got the best car

many other great teams have had bad years before but didn't want to quit because of it

red bull is like a child that just got told it can't have the toy it wants 




 my opinion is Ferrari is more interested in Bottas than Ricciardo if kimi leaves 




 i think people are just over the domination by Mercedes. 

We just came out of 4 years of red bull to go straight into 2 years of complete Mercedes domination (who knows if the same will happen next year)

at least a few years back after the 2000-2004 Ferrari domination the 2005-2006 seasons was actually close (kimi and schumacher almost winning) then 2007-2009 being different teams winning 




 seems they are willing to take the risk for some more speed at this rate they will keep getting 6th place or lower 




 urging Renault to take risks is going to lead to more engine problems but it's not like that matters considering both drivers have almost used up the allocated engines 









 honestly i hate this track with a passion and if it didn't have the history behind the track it would of been scrapped years ago 

qualifying is the only part worth watching for me 




 Monaco is worse 




 i thinking Ferrari might be looking at replacing kimi with bottas 




 the other teams have already improved the cars and some have more updates coming so i don't see it making a massive difference even when they do get the 2015 car..

 




 they are going to need a hell of a lot of funds to do any better the other teams will improve cars for 2016 and leave them in the dust again 




 they are just there to get in the way of other cars... they always get lapped 3-4 times and are at least 3-4 seconds behind in qualifying times

they have no place in F1 unless they improve significantly which i don't see happening  




 the pit stop is what screwed him more than anything but the start didn't help 




 it's time for marussia to leave F1.. 3-4 seconds behind in qualifying and lapped 3-4 times in a race 




 excuses.. no other team on the "dirty side" had a bad start he screwed up  




 Hamilton's shit start didn't help him as well as the bad pit stop 




 Hamilton screwed up at the start and had a shit pit stop vettel didn't ruin anything 




 don't even know why they are still even in F1 they are a joke 




 he won't lol if he blows the engine 




 these streams are like AIDS for me always cutting in and out at the worse times 




 ouch bad pit stop 




 he'll screw his tyres if he pushes too much 




 he had a shit start 




 button sounds drunk every time he makes a radio message 




 thanks seems like a good one 




 any decent streams going almost all of them are screwed 




 this will get downvoted to hell but Raikkonen is overrated and Ferrari is wasting money on him 




 it's basically been used for marketing so in a way it's disrespectful even if someone from the family approved 




 not the same as putting them on stage in front of a audience as a hologram especially when it's about marketing 
























 because Hamilton fanboys are complete morons

they are the ones who comment "It's sabotage" anytime something happens to Hamilton 




 i wouldn't compare them until they both have a better car so far it's been a piece of shit 




 considering he imminently blamed grosjean i don't see him growing out of it soon

you only learn from mistakes if you can admit you made one

 




 makes sense 




 figured i'd post this as it seems not many people have seen it and it's still up on youtube atm 









 back onboard camera of Grosjean if anyone hasn't seen it yet

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfQT_iZX-NE
 




 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfQT_iZX-NE 




 Grosjean doesn't need to explain himself Max was at fault even though he doesn't want to admit it 




 i've been applying for a few jobs lately and found that a lot but not all redirect to their own website and ask you to fill out forms which ask for the same details which are on your resume

why do some places do this? example is they ask for previous employment history and references yet they would be in the resume

edit- forget to add they also ask you to upload a  resume 




 he may of not said it but he's implying it especially by saying he's got the hallmarks of schumacher/senna
 




 brundle has basically already said it about Verstappen

Verstappen will be a world championship-winning team before he is 20. He is showing all the hallmarks of a Senna, of a Schumacher in my view,  




 the racing and results so far i just think sainz has a lot more potential but it isn't recongised as much because Verstappen gets more hype due to his age 




 i think sainz is a great driver who isn't being recognised as much because of the hype surrounding the younger Verstappen

i honestly think he has the better chance of being a future world champion and would be a waste of good talent if he isn't picked up by one of the bigger teams 









 most Hamilton fans see it as exactly that but there is always idiot fanboys making comments about sabotage etc 




 anytime something happens to Hamilton his fanboys come out with the sabotage remarks. 




 before i even opened it i knew there would be a comment about it being a sabotage

 




 still is this is just a massive Mercedes fuck up for hamilton 




 why did hamilton pit? just gave away the win 




 for good reason it's a shit track that only exists because it's historic

it's time to retire it and get a better track that allows some actual racing 




 that's the problem it's a historic track they'll never get rid of it no matter how more boring the races get

if this was not a historic track it would of been abandoned years ago
 




 always is at Monaco worst race of the season by far

if it wasn't a historical track it would of been ditched years ago 




 it's for people new to the sport you dingleberry

sports don't survive if they don't get new fans

 




 you could say the same about everyone using a smartphone or buying any clothes made in sweatshop countries

pretty sure many have died making the things we all go out and buy on a daily basis and no one seems to care 




 people are stupid 




 also any clothes made in china or the other sweatshop countries which is basically everything we buy 




 just people jumping on the bandwagon give it a few days they won't care anymore 




 kimi needs to improve or he won't have a seat soon enough 




 so how many of you actually cared about Qatar before the visa and coke threads?

typical bandwagon jumping that you will all forget about when these threads die down,  you will then continue life as normal using smartphones built in sweat shops and wearing clothes made under worse conditions yet no thread for that 
 




 then forget about a day or two later when this drops off the main page

i'd wager money most people commenting didn't give a fuck about Qatar before this
 




 they are settling back into their usual position

last year was a one off 




 shouldn't be illegal due to the stupidity of the person who didn't secure it 




 not really a bad thing lots of idiots on the road

they must of bribed the driving instructor to pass them
 




 it won't at least not on something as big as the world cup

even if sponsors pull out someone will front the money and the show will go on and it will be watched by millions/billions

people wanted to boycott Russia during the winter Olympics because of the gay laws they passed yet it had no impact 




 the world cup will go ahead in Qatar as planned even if coke or whoever else pulls out

hundreds of millions if not billions around the world will still watch it when it's on in 2022

no one will remember this post as people tend to jump on bandwagons and then move on completely forgetting about it
 




 any form of comedy as it seems these days more and more people are "offended" by jokes 




 this is also why product placement is increasing in all shows if people don't watch commercials they will just get the show to drink their drinks with the labels showing on camera etc 




 it's impressive for a first time but he has to do in qualifying for it to mean anything 




 all depends on how he qualifies 




 nope that's fucking retarded

music is music people are people big fucking difference between them no matter what the history of the music is

i also hate classical and country i guess this means i hate white people as well




 




 yep that's how retarded people are becoming 




 rap (mostly the new crap these days) is just shit doesn't make someone racist for hating shit music 




 there is always someone willing to do that they then forget about it a day or two later and wait for the next controversy to pretend to care about 




 it's likely a translation issue and he didn't meant it the way the rest of us see the word

although there is always people who will pretend to be offended by it cause a stink about it then forget about it a few days later when they move on to the next "controversy" to pretend to care about 




 kimi is on is his last legs within the next year or two ferrari will replace him 




 honestly i think Ricciardo gets a little more credit then he deserves due to last year.. his wins came from safety cars and when Mercedes had issues

what i want to see is him get a good car for a few years and see if he can consistently pull off results like 2014 or if it was just a one off

right now the red bull is a turd so you can't count this year to be fair to him 




 sport games are the worst offenders.. cod and battlefield are bad but at least try to bring something new 




 this game is becoming the FIFA of the racing games

they need to add more to it (not sure what) but just following the actual sport and making slight adjustments to AI and handling just isn't enough to want to buy it each year

 




 he also ate all but one of the outside chair cushions he now sits on the remaining one every day 




 he would be thrown into a mental asylum if he came back today

"i'm the son of god"... sure you are buddy right this way to the padded wall room 




 popular vote runs a risk of people voting against it there is still a lot of people (mostly old but some young) who are against it

many might not even publicly say it either and can vote no without anyone else knowing 




 this will probably pass but is this type of vote the best way to do it?

there are a lot of people who are against gay marriage but might not ever say it in public.. voting like this allows them to vote no without anyone else knowing 




 i don't think he has many years left in F1

Ferrari will be looking at other drivers to replace him (probably Bottas or Ricciardo)

he needs more results like bahrain if he wants to keep his seat
 
























 beats sound like shit compared to many of the much cheaper brands

it's just it was "cool" to be seen wearing beats.. idiots easily part with money 




 he must of forgotten about the crusades 




 people still have to control and maintain them drones don't shoot missiles by themselves

besides send a drone in and if it gets shot down you lose a drone not a plane and a human 




 Nope just not a lazy grubby cunt 




 you don't own the house and should have it clean all the time

it's not hard to keep a house clean unless you're lazy 




 it's more the fact you have to go to the government and get a license which shows them you take drugs

people are not going to want to do that 




 nope i studied at tafe and paid rent it's possible to do when you have a full time job and study at night 




 a drug license wouldn't be a good idea no one is going to want to get one and will just continue to buy off dealers 




 they don't want to pay ridiculous amounts of money that we are charged for things

it's called the Australia tax for a reason

also most shows are still delayed here 




 only problem with streaming is the exclusive deals they all have

if you have netflix and x show is on foxtel you can't stream it without having foxtel as well as netflix.. then you have the other few streaming services which all have an exclusive show

piracy might have lowered a little bit but it will pick up as people don't want to subscribe to 2-3 services just to watch the shows they want 




 the war on drugs is a waste of time anywhere it's fought

it failed a long time ago yet they refuse to change tactics.. 

even America the country who started the whole war on drugs thing has realised this and some of it's states have legalised things like weed 




 greens won't get that many more votes people might hate the alp and liberals but the greens are seen as wackos by a lot of people 




 not buying work lunches is the best way to save money when i was working construction i was easily spending around 100-150 a week

all those coffees bacon and egg rolls and maccas lunches put holes in my pay

luckily i didn't smoke as well as my work mates would do the same but add a pack of smokes a day 




 yep it's easy to find work as a schoolkid at mcdonalds in fact that's the age fast food places generally want because they can pay them less then the older people

you can easily switch to part or full time after school or stay casual if you have uni and make money

it's what i did i saved thousands working 6 years at maccas while studying

my guess is some people quit after they turn 18 because they don't want to work in fast food anymore due to embarrassment or something 




 no point helping them no way to guarantee the food gets to the people instead of the military etc

besides that they have been pissing off the world with the missile tests and nuclear program and most countries are not going to want to aid them unless they agree to stop testing missiles etc 




 all thanks to the anti-vax retards

seriously whooping cough should be a thing of the past but no retards think they know better than doctors/scientists and years of medical research    




 so we should just leave them out on the streets to commit more crime? 

 




 shitloads of people do that many don't have wealthy parents either 




 don't see what will make anyone spew she worked and saved money and bought properties

any money she received from the family was wisely used instead of been pissed up the wall like most people at that age

I think the reason why people think they cannot buy property is because they want a multi-million dollar house now. Youve got to start somewhere and build it up, she said."

that is actually sound advice.. lots of people are not willing to live far from the city so prices are much higher, the further you move the cheaper it is.. the commute might suck but you'll have a cheap decent home/apartment 




 nothing shocking about it they commit crimes and are put in jail. 

most of them are re offenders and it's the reason they are in jail if they don't commit crime they won't be in jail it's as simple as that 




 the last time they adopted a "softer" approach people smugglers where having a field day

you don't want a situation where you open the boarders again and have boat after boat come here because they know we'll just take them 

all it will lead to if more deaths at sea just like last time but a lot of people seem to conveniently forget that when they cry for a softer approach  




 Hulkenberg is a good driver wasting away at a shit team i hope the guy gets a offer from a better team  




 well it's not like they could do any worse 




 they stabilize the car when it's up on the jacks if i'm not mistaken 




 2013 by far

my advice is skip every 2-3 games as they don't change enough to justify buying it every year 




 i see this game like fifa get every 2nd or 3rd one because the changes are usually only slight improvements of the graphics and the liveries/drivers of cars and maybe a tweak to handling

to me it's not worth getting every year 




 if those 4 teams all had a decent car fighting for the championship no one would be calling f1 boring

 









 back when he started health and safety wasn't as bad as it is these days

these days saftey comes before anything even if it ends up killing the sport or whatever

it's happening in every sport where they ban or restrict things that for years where fine 




 in Sydney around Gosford (around 75km from city) and even further the house prices come down considerably

some people are just not willing to live that far out of the city.. 

yes it would be a shit commute if the job was in the city but you have to buy what you can afford or you will rent forever in the city 




 most people try to fill the carry on bags with as much shit as they can if the other baggage is nearly overweight to avoid fees 




 a black market for porn would form in under a second 




 open files like music.mp3.exe 




 or they threaten legal action for defamation and the person put the site back up

what they did is actually illegal regardless if they where paid or not (the last 2 lines on the site)

 




 ^ this

very risky doing this and will likely land the person in a lot of trouble if they sue him 




 skyrim for me fell short in dialogue

a handful of voice actors for the mass amount of NPC's and even then most of the lines are recycled so you hear them a million times

the guards being a great example


 




 they should do it again and expand upon it

it was pure laziness doing it like they did in skyrim 




 might be forced retirement if he continues performing the way he is 




 having decided to play thru skyrim again one thing i hope the next game does is hire more voice actors

seriously i forgot how bad it was hearing the same voices repeated over and over again (the same lines as well), wouldn't be hard to pay a few different ones to give some variety so they don't have to recycle the voices for everyone 




 this kid should just shut up already he was in the wrong and can't admit it now is talking shit like a douchebag

the Verstappen hype is beyond annoying now and just giving this kid a big head
 









 he's not lying about the part that people will drive right past you if you're bleeding on the street

i had a bad car accident a few years back (mangled car bleeding all over the place from head injury) and at least 5-6 cars just drove right past only one stopped to see if we where ok 




 don't understand why some of the trophies are all the same colour.. why don't they at least have one gold silver and bronze

besides that they look like something that belongs in a kitchen 




 do you think the other engine manufacturers like BMW or Toyota will return to f1? 

would be good to see Williams become a works team i don't see them winning as a customer team 




 they are trying to ban it in all sports problem is that's a shitload of money out of the sports

question is who would come in and provide it 




 they still don't realise that everything they do just lures more young people to it 




 have to say black looks better than red for this car

usually i only like red Ferrari's but this one is amazing in black 




 they are biased because it's a dutch driver because i don't see torro rosso making that claim 




 proven by the data they used to penalise him grosjeans car braked 5 meters later than the previous lap

it was a rookie mistake but one he just won't admit he made 




 it's not and happens every year this type of response is the exact reason why this charity has no funding 




 hes already been proven otherwise he just doesn't want to admit he made a mistake

with a attitude like that i won't be surprised if he crashes into another wall this year 




 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS4Dh_EAfJI

i still prefer the the sound of the v8 over the v6

 




 it's good they are addressing one of the major complaints i know it won't be v8 levels but it's better than the current lawn mowers

 




 he still can't admit he was at fault even with the data showing grosjean braked later than the previous lap

he won't learn from mistakes unless he can admit he made them won't be surprised if he crashes again this year 
























 it a utter shit show that i'm surprised is still on the air 




 so you went into the designated smoking area and complain you smelled of smoke when you went home? 




 a large majority of people both young and old don't like the greens it's been this way for a long time 




 people would switch the tv off if they did that lots of people don't like the greens 




 as i said if a kid is being unreasonably loud and they can't control it they should leave it's as simple as that.. that's the respectful thing to do they can easily feed the kid at home if they cannot control it in public

other people shouldn't have dining experiences ruined because some little brat won't keep quite

it's not that people hate kids it's that people are sick of parents that allow kids to continue being loud or often run around the restaurant or whatever..


 




 if you are unable to quite the kid down you should leave as to not disturb everyone else around you that's the respectful thing to do

other people should not have to put up with a loud child no matter the age of it


 




 what the woman did might of been a little harsh but lets admit it we've all thought about doing it when a parent just lets the kid squeal and scream in a public place because they are too stupid or lazy to control them

when i was a kid if i did what this woman's kids did i would of been in trouble because my parents knew how to control us and respected the people around us.

really sick of the parents that just allow kids to run around screaming in public and make excuses like they are finding their voice or we where all kids once.. those excuses just mean they are bad parents that can't control their kids

 




 i hate to say it but i'm getting sick of hearing about gay marriage now.. every fucking article/news report etc etc almost every day of the week 




 does the majority want change though?

still a lot of people who are against gay marriage 




  imo the last time we had a hung parliament and ALP needed to make deals with the greens etc is what made people hate the greens 




 The job cuts were always going to happen email has taken over for the vast majority of people I cant even remember the last letter I sent or received that wasn't a bill or something

Parcels are what everyone uses auspost for now 




 Maybe America should finish one war before starting another 




 it higher than most people earn some miners are on 150 or more 




 this kids attitude lately has been getting on my nerves he just can't take any criticism from anyone

he probably still thinks he wasn't at fault for the crash either 




 making pokie machines "plain packaging" would do nothing to stop people gambling just like making cigarettes plain packaging did nothing to stop people smoking 




 the new logo looks far better anyway, they were kind of asking for it with the old one regardless of how pathetic is it pursue them for it.. N5 is Chanel's trademark

 









 Ricciardo was in the right place at the right time when Mercedes had problems

besides that the other cars were piles of crap especially the Ferrari 




 just because he beat him once doesn't mean he is in the same league as him

plenty of drivers over the years have had off years 




 drivers don't get to choose who the teammate is 




 no one is getting fired they are taking a paycut on the already high wages they earn (some are on 150k or more)

besides the ceo taking a paycut to keep paying workers the same amount of money is not going to fix anything they would still be losing money as costs would be the same

just because a CEO has money in the bank doesn't mean they have to run the company at a loss that would just lead to workers getting fired in the long run when they lose more and more money 




 mining isn't as profitable as it was years ago even she has lost billions.. a small pay cut so workers can keep the job is not greedy they could of easily sacked them instead

it's the same of any other business no matter how big or small if they are not making money workers are the first to go or take pay cuts 




 Ricciardo is overrated imo due to last year

yes he beat vettel but his wins came from Mercedes having issues and safety cars 




 considering these people would be on good pay anyway (some would be on 100k+) a slight cut to a wage is better than losing the job 




 practically every country in the world that has freedom can do what you just listed 




 i expected to see stupid comments like this 




 i don't even have the game but just because you are not having issues doesn't mean other people are not

besides no PC game should have a fps cap even if you can edit a file to change it 




 i think they know a lot of people don't like the future crap and will make a ww2 COD to gain back people who probably won't buy black ops 3 or ghosts 2 









 i knew Ferrari would go after bottas the sooner they get rid of kimi the better

don't get me wrong kimi was a great driver he just doesn't have it anymore 




 there is always a way just look at china etc 




 if they are cutting career mode out of the game this year they are likely never going to put it back into the game unless there is outrage from the fans 




 they need to take a break from super hero movies over the last decade there has been WAY too many 




 it's declining and has been for a while it's the whole reason why there was that meeting to discuss changes and why so many past and present drivers are suggesting ideas to make it interesting again.

sure there are fans that love it how it is but without new fans coming in the sport can't survive.

the biggest complaint i see from people who are not diehard fans is that it's boring and predictable, it's not helped that it went from 4 years of vettel domination (even with those 2 close years) to the current 2 years of utter complete Mercedes domination.

then you have broadcasting which in many areas is no longer on free to air tv and attending races costs an arm and a leg and probably a liver as well 




 they can't many businesses and people use them all the time for legal reasons

they can't seem to grasp that VPN's are not just used by people wanting to pirate 




 fair use probably comes into play with other sites regarding copyright on most of the stuff they post

when you just take a pay porn video and upload it for free it breaches it 




 don't be so sure about that labor isn't in a good place and the greens won't ever be elected as a large majority of people still hate them 




 people already know they'll just have incentive to sign up for the VPN's 




 it will be easily for them to block sites like pornhub etc as many of it's users upload videos from subscription sites 




 i'm not a homeowner but you'll be hard pressed to find a home owner who would be happy to see the value of houses drop and they don't have to be rich to think like that 




 actually a large majority of people are.. labor is self destructing and people still avoid the greens like the plague so don't be surprised if they win the next election 




 living in that hellhole he'll be used to explosions 




 it's more the potential for him to go lone wolf like monis did 




 the fact he's threaten to kill people in the past and the courts went easy on him

he clearly supports ISIS

man monis did similar things and they screwed up by not keeping a eye on him letting 2 people die when he finally decided to kill 




 Queensland Liberal and panel member Steve Ciobo was unapologetic, saying he believed the only reason Mr Mallah was acquitted of terrorism was that the terrorist offences "weren't retrospective in application", and that he would be glad to see Mr Mallah sent out of the country.

so would i he was jailed for threatening to kill asio and other government staff and traveled to Syria during the Arab spring

he clearly supports ISIS and has no place in civilised society

if he's left unchecked he could easily become the next man monis


 









 good hope they didn't die instantly for the pain they've caused people 




 foxtel can celebrate all it wants it's a few years away from falling apart 




 good luck getting people to vote for the greens

a lot of people hate liberal and labor but still won't vote for them 




 they are not going to give up areas that people live on it just won't happen

 




 this is why i believe the word racist is starting to really lose it's meaning and impact now

it's thrown around like candy even if someone is just criticising someone without bringing up anything about race
 




 this is the 2nd time he's lost control of the car since the upgrade in Canada

is he struggling with the new engine upgrades or just unlucky? 









 that's about all they will get no way in hell they'll get back any areas we live in

and honestly who would be willing to give up their home/suburb etc to the aboriginals

lots of people pretend to care but are more than willing to continue living here


 
























 do you think they will even enforce this? you're not allowed to smoke at bus stops either but people still do it 









 will never happen in a million years in this country they'll run a scare campaign about people who have died from it and it will never get off the ground

they would much rather continue fighting the failed drug war 




 at least he did it in practice and not the race 




 For me in my region most servers on the browers are the surf maps and what not for some reason there are no normal map servers 




 I think that speaks volumes about the quality of other maps...  They all should be balanced well instead of favouring one team over the other  




 i highly doubt they'll keep him they are already eying other drivers like bottas

will be a shame but his performance hasn't been great

if he goes we'll need a new driver for hilarious radio messages 




 should this be something a school teaches or something parents/friends should help people with if they don't know how to do it?

personally i always used an accountant because i found a cheap one and he was able to find a lot more savings then i would of. 

though doing taxes isn't that hard 









 the issue is casual doesn't let you exclude maps and the other maps in that group are good 




 i really don't get how people can play it so much especially the people who've been playing CS since it came out 




 i would rather some variety playing the same map over and over gets boring even if it's a good map

besides if you know nothing about a map you learn it by playing it 




 its like some people just can't get enough of it that they have to constantly vote for it a gazillion times

just played a few rounds of casual for fun and dust2 was voted for 3 times (twice in a row) happens every day

maps been out for like (15 years?) you would think people wouldn't want to play it every 5 seconds  




 it's still awesome as well so much better than diablo 3 




 of course they knew they just didn't care

they know gamers will pre order/buy it anyway 




 they could of used any respectful Muslim (community leaders or just your average joe) instead of using this dickhead

they used him because they knew it would cause a stir and that's good for ratings.
 




 it's good that they got the warning the dickhead should never of been on the show in the first place

 




 bank transfer paypal or bitcoins dealers will always find a way if we go cashless 




 considering how much money they spend on a race you would think they could get better trophies 




 the thing that annoys me the most is when people put unpitted olives on pizzas and in salads

 




 this entire situation is beyond pathetic now it's obviously brought up now to get the Aussies to buy the book 




 used to work at maccas don't see how this will work at all stores especially those with only 1 or 2 grills

eggs need their own grill (different temperature can't cook them on a meat one etc) so that would take a half of a grill out all day long that could be used during busy periods for meat

 




 so what business model is a local hardware shop that employs a few people going to implement when a Bunnings opens down the road?

many small shops are in similar situations 

 




 McDonald's is like that everywhere both franchise and company owned

however they won't raise the regular crew pay much higher than the minimum as they are unskilled if they get into the manager positions the pay is actually pretty decent 




 lot of people think pay rises are always good they don't think of the people who will lose their jobs/have shifts cut or the fact that businesses will hire less people

 




 it was criminals he killed people don't tend to care about criminals which is why the movie and what not was so popular

a extremist muslim threatening terrorist attacks is much different to that even if he didn't carry it out

 




 many businesses might not hire as much staff now or they will reduce the casual staffs shifts (over 18's mostly) to the bare minimum 




 many small businesses struggle to stay open as it is you got to remember they have competition with other small business and the big businesses that come in and screw them all over

lots of cafe's and what not  don't open on sundays because they just can't pay the increased rate 




 doesn't matter that mallah didn't kill he's a Muslim terrorist that threatened Australians 




 How much are businesses going to raise prices now they are paying employees more?  




 Big business yes small businesses might not be able to afford to pay If they have a few employees 




 Wasn't it criminals that chopper killed? If so that's why people see him as a hero you don't see other killers that killed innocent people lifted to that status

In regards to the Muslim terrorist once you make threats you'll never lose the status of a terrorist  




 considering the book is about making bombs etc it's not a good idea to try and import it giving the current situation with all the terrorism laws etc

you're just asking for trouble 




 yep consumer advice, the usual dodgy tradie bit, something on binge drinking and hoons 




 lots of people grew to hate them because of it the next election greens got far less seats 




 should we hand out cotton wool as well.. entire generations of kids played on those just fine 




 who didn't see this coming terrible idea banning smoking in a jail

won't be surprised if violence rises substantially even after these riots  









 i don't even own a home it's the reality of the situation and many people are starting to move away from the city to get a affordable house

areas like gosford etc are cheaper than sydney and it's only an hour and a half by train to the city 




 I know it's a beta but it really needs more content it's still fun but playing the same maps and modes is getting boring 




 Too bad you either find a house that's affordable or you rent closer to the city the house prices are not coming down any time soon 




 They can if they move out of the city but many are not willing too as their job is likely in the city and they don't want to make the long commute 









 people standing on both sides of the escalator.. ffs stay on one side to allow people to walk up/down them 




 only walked out of one and it was because it was a commission only shitty sales job where you are supposed to sell some waterless car wash crap in a can to people in a car park

part of the interview was to follow one of the workers around to see them in action i just walked off and went home

no where on the application did it state that was the job and i needed stable work not a commission only sales job 




 never found either Amy Poehler or tina fay funny 




 not surprising given how many Americans believe in creationism 




 41% of Americans are stupid 




 as long as he is at williams i doubt he'll ever get another shot at a WDC

williams won't win as a customer team 




 i think many companies would jump at the opportunity to buy one of these if they can get a house done in 2 or so days they will be able to take more jobs on

builders now take a few jobs and spend time at each over the course of a few weeks

besides it's still going to need people to load and maintain it 




 apparently the average age of bricklayers is going up as well not as many young people taking the job 




 many people have lost jobs over the years when something better has been invented

if this robot can do it quicker and cheaper it will replace brickies in the long run 




 what Australian company would have a distribution network like coke though? 




 Coca-Cola already uses its distribution networks to deliver drugs for HIV/Aids, tuberculosis and malaria in a number of African nations, in partnership with the Global Fund, supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

coke would have good distribution networks i don't see any issue with this if it helps aid 
























 they are as useless as tits on a bull 




 the greens would probably try 




 i think more places are going to implement something like this people are sick of having meals ruined by screaming kids 




 can't blame them the stench of urine they often leave behind is disgusting

not to mention you often have to play dodge the syringe and goon cask in many areas they sleep 




 You're a fucking idiot

It kills the nightlife because you can't get in or move to a different pub or club if it dies out or if you want to meet up with other people

The only place you can get into is the casino and that's not a good place for a night out

 




 They were and it's destroyed Sydney's nightlife

The vast majority of people never caused a problem no matter how drunk they are it was a handful of dickheads that caused The issues

Fucking sick of this nanny state and the population that keeps supporting shit like this 




 People just don't find women's sport as entertaining as the mens..  

For me it's like watching a local team play as the quality is just not The same

Sorry but that's just the reality of the situation...  If the quality was on par with the mens it  would get more followers 




 I'm referring more to popular sports like cricket,soccer,football etc

 people might watch the womens tennis more for a perve but the quality of the matches compared to the men is no where near the same.. when some of the better female players retire i don't think the perve aspect will be enough 




 no chance it doesn't have the following to take a prime time tv spot as it's not as interesting as men's sport

why would tv stations sponsors and advertisers waste money on something that has a small following 




 no one will watch it and the reason why is not sexism or anything like that

women's sport just isn't as interesting as the men's it's like watching a local team play if you compare the two

it's the main reason why people don't watch it and because of that it doesn't attract sponsors and advertising and what not to get prime time tv spots. 




 no company would buy one imagine how much business they would lose if the truck had to recharge before making the last delivery or something 




 for it to work it would need to last longer than a few hours considering how long and far truck drivers drive each day

no company is going to buy a truck that runs out of juice in a few hours (likely in the middle of nowhere with no charging station) 




 electric trucks won't be a thing until they can go miles and miles without a charge. 

on the roads they use there are no charging stations i can't see people running out to get trucks that for years would be useless 




 that won't go over well with voters a large majority of people don't want open borders 




 nah i love seeing buffering on every video i watch 




 they need better education not scare campaigns and to make it a health issue not a criminal one

the current way just isn't working and will just get worse until they actually treat the users instead of charging them

even if they end up in jail they still have access to it because no jail in the world is drug free 




 it won't happen under any government for years too many people still think the drug war is a good idea

its why they have no fucking clue what to do about ice except the usual scare campaign ad 




 it's going to cause fights 




 so what if you just went into a shop for a second to get something and someone decides to smash your window?

can see many fights starting over this 




 hate it when people bring up politics or religion at parties it's just fucking annoying and always causes problems 




 big fucking no on playing in women's sport it's massively unfair
 




 nah they like the internet and the devices made in sweat shops to access it

give it a day or two they'll forget all about nestle 




 another thing for people to pretend to care about you'll still buy nestle products even after reading or watching the video.. they make a hell of a lot of stuff

just like you buy iphones and clothes and everything else made in sweat shops and other slave labour but you don't seem to care about that 




 i think people will now see that uber is a evil company that doesn't give a fuck about it's workers

everyone is just in a "honeymoon period" with them because they have better service than most taxis 




 it would be vandalised more by drunk passengers than taxi drivers

driverless taxis in a city at night with drunk people is a terrible idea 




 it's a recipe for disaster

too many dickheads would vandlise them puke in them smoke in them do lines in them etc 




 they really shouldn't be although i do understand it's hard to always take time off when your sick

fucking hate it though when a co-worker comes in sick makes everyone sick 




 it would be unfair to get rid of him for next year considering the car is rubbish

that would be a crap way to end his f1 career

 




 i honestly think that was a Google marketing ploy to see if there was interest in a phone like that

not long after that went viral there was suddenly an announcement that a phone like that was in the works for like a year or so already  




 The company is working on a project which could provide the key to human immortality. Teaming up with Dr. Arthur Levinson, Google are working on ways to slow down the human aging process.

overpopulation is already becoming a problem we really don't need people living a lot longer than they already are 




 good! nothing more annoying than screaming kids who often run around a restaurant because parents can't control them

if parents had tried to control the kids (took them outside to cool off or left if they didn't behave) this ban wouldn't be in place

 




 actually they often end well.. lots of people don't want meals ruined by screaming kids who often run around a restaurant because parents can't control them 




 ISIS controls a great majority of a country and is slaughtering people they are a big threat in that region

you can't compare them to a battle 2000 years ago 




 yes it would wars haven't really had a frontline in a while so even if "real armies" where attacked by a force of 600 or so terrorists it would make a footnote 




 that's not going to happen 




 happens with every boycott/controversy etc etc people pretend to care for a few days while it's trending then move on to the next thing

most people have already forgotten about Qatar 




 i find the dickhead cyclists that wear all black at night a bigger problem

i've seen some riding without a reflector on the back as well 

just asking to be run over 




 your sensitive ass is costing millions to fix the sewage system as you and others flush them down the toilet

everyone ends up paying for that one way or the other 




 why would they be paid a big amount of money when most people are not even watching it?

billions tune in for the men's world cup most people don't even know or care about the women's world cup 




 some of them think it's the tour de france in shared pathways 




 meh it's the women's world cup it's like watching a local team play if you compare it to the men's

that's why women's sport just isn't as popular as the men's 




 don't get why these idiots boast on the police facebook page they'll fucking track it

the guy looks like a retard anyway and probably won't even be trying to hide IP and what not 









 they just want to break some more laws bunch of cockroaches on wheels 




 the hate comes from the fact the guy is overhyped and seems to have a big head because of it.. people are already calling him a future world champion and what not

plus not taking the blame for the Monaco crash saying he was brake tested didn't help either 




 The black market will reform if you do that 




 if you make it hard or expensive to get it legally people will just buy them illegally  




 shit like this happens all the time doesn't matter if your homeless or not

it's the same when someone has a serious car accident.. most people just drive past maybe 1 out of ten will stop to help 




 don't be so sure about that people will walk past anyone 




 Ferrari lucked into that podium they have some work to do 




 rain expected in 15 minutes
 




 ever since Ferrari did that upgrade they have been pretty shit seems like they have gone downhill 




 missed the fucking start due to shit streams 




 hopefully to change things up

besides he's also paying $26 for the win on my betting site 
























 of course they will adopt the boat turn back policy it's what voters want and the last time they changed the policy there was a rise in arrivals by boats with many deaths at sea.

abbot was able to capitalise on that so changing it now wouldn't be a good idea.

i know many people on this sub would want to see a greens style approach to it but that's not what the greater majority of voters want and it could lose votes for whatever party tries to do it. 




 dr google wins again 




 great video awesome view

honest question though that i've been thinking about recently how long till drones are banned or heavily regulated? wanted to buy one but i have a feeling there will be new laws with them soon enough

 




 No one will give anything back to the aboriginals  




 NFl is so exciting with the 3 seconds play between 5 minutes of commercials and play reviews i fall asleep within 2 minutes of trying to watch that crap sport 




 no i like soccer and the world cups are 4 years apart not going to miss it because of a flag 




 that's still way to much

your healthcare system is a joke

 




 people need to stop crying so much about it so many people are becoming such precious little babies about everything

are they supposed to be goody two shoes so you all stop whinging? who even cares what they do off (or even on) the court

if they are making the sport money they will not get rid of them

 




 why is your healthcare so shit that someone without insuance would have to pay that much money? 




 that has to be fake how the fuck could your healthcare system be that shit

so glad i don't live in america

i broke my neck a few years ago and even needed a helicopter to the hospital a week stay with all the xrays cat scans physiotherapy etc.. cost me $0 and i didn't even have insurance
 




 game would suck if everyone was scared of you.. who would you kill besides monsters if everyone was like hail Geralt please don't hurt me

it's the same in Skyrim you fus ro dah someone off a mountain and his bandit buddies still try to attack you 




 Williams isn't winning anything as a customer team he's knows that and will take a offer from Ferrari

Mercedes won't dominate forever, Ferrari looks the best next option unless red bull gets there shit together and gets a car that doesn't explode almost every race. Mclaren won't be a challenger for at least 3-4 years and it seems they have a driver line up for the next few years

 




 i think haas will be better than manor 




 many people (Americans mostly) are prudes

blood guts and murder is fine but if they see just one tit they lose their minds 




 this is why the game needs a new game+ mode where you keep everything but the difficulty is much higher 




 yer that was a massive disappointment as well i had a sword i got from a chest or monster that did like 50 more damage or something i just ended up selling it 




 not the point it should of given something decent and unique not witch hunter armor given how witch hunters are evil and hated by players

i know you can now craft witcher armor but it would of been nice to get a decent reward armor instead of that crap especially if your not crafting witcher armor 




 they should of made the reward witcher gear 




 i thought that at first but after about 10 mintues i got the hang of it and it was a solid game from then on

i was close to uninstalling it because i thought the combat was stupid lucky i didn't 




 just wish it was better that archgriffin was a bastard to fight

don't know why they thought witch hunter armor would be a good reward 




 haven't got it on Xbox but it's one of the best games i've played in years

better than skyrim IMO 




 the stats and what not are great but i wasn't expecting it be witch hunter armor

witch hunters are cunts and i don't want to look like a cunt

don't know why they thought that would be a good reward 




 your military spends trillions and you want to complain about a small space mission costing under a billion that will make new discoveries

not to mention countless other shit in US and worldwide that has millions/billions wasted on it

stop your complaining it's a small amount of money 




 it's more than just photos it's a scientific mission that will learn new things

there is plenty of things on this world that could be considered a waste of millions of dollars but no one complains about it but when it's a space mission you all come out of the woodwork 




 roughly 2 billion on baldness treatment worldwide a year (probably more)

people just see space as useless so it's a waste of money in their eyes 




 why does everyone always say this?

throwing some food at the worlds hungry people solves nothing they still have no food when that runs out in day or two

 




 what good would that do? 

you feed them for a day or two but they still don't have access to food after that 




 always annoys me when people say things like it's a waste of money etc etc when it comes to things in space

billions goes into hair loss treatment but not for malaria and other life threatening things but you don't see people complain about that

 




 i'd say the same about the hipsters who wear skinny jeans 




 there is a lot of young people that don't vote greens don't think just because people are young they instantly vote greens

green voters typically are in inner city areas outside of that i don't think the support is as high


 




 if the streak is 5 years long and it like this with Mercedes on the podium every race F1 will lose a lot of people who are already saying the sport is predictable and boring
 




 a new much harder game mode that let you keep your end game stuff would be great for those that want a bigger challenge

 




 the reason is ISIS is a threat that's happening now which people can clearly see slaughtering people and encouraging terrorist attacks worldwide it's also manged to brainwash people worldwide to join them (including schoolkids)

Climate change is a threat but one that is slow and changes happen over decades

humans tend to react to immediate danger not one that takes years 




 Its not essential but it helps so you know the characters from the last two games and some of The back story about the wars and what not

Though if the 3rd game is the first one you played you might not like the first two (game play not the story)  movement is completely different like no jumping or climbing unless there is a press whatever to jump or climb,  plus combat is different as well 




 Never a good idea playing a game series backwards there is huge differences between the 3 games

Before I bought witcher 3 I made sure to play the other 2 first far better idea 




 the greens are too far on the other side of the spectrum that people won't vote for them because of it

howard and abbott both got a lot of votes over border control policies which shows the majority doesn't want relaxed polices like the greens would bring 




 those countries have been fucked for years the wars are nothing on what the Taliban and Saddam did the difference was people couldn't just leave as they can now 




 don't like it and i don't even bother playing it

i liked the dice game from the previous two games better it was quick and a nice way to make some extra coin 




 most people always carry ID on them it's not rare these days to not leave home without it as we carry them in wallets 




 this is what i mean it's a good mechanic but the game relies on it way too heavily that it's overused

most quests end up using it at some point some way more than others

 




 i was fine with it at first but it got annoying towards the end

every single time i heard Geralt say gotta take a look around i knew i would be spending the next few minutes following a red trail towards something 




 have more witnesses to beast attacks which can narrow the search field so you don't have to follow blood trails and scents every single time or something like that

i don't mind witcher sense i just feel they really overdid it  




 i think they really overdid the witcher sense in this game almost every quest has you following a blood trail or scent

i know it's part of a witcher to have these abilities but they really overdid it just like Assassins creed used to overdo the trailing/eavesdrop missions

it's a great game (probably the best i've played in years) but the witcher sense part of it got tiresome considering how much they use it 




 if you're just getting one gram in Sydney it's typically $20 but i don't buy one gram at a time because it's a waste of money
 




 if much easier now to get drugs but it's pretty easy to get booze as well if they have a older sibling or someone at their school is 18

i used to get booze of people i worked with at maccas when i was 16 as many of the people i worked with were 18+ 




 if you mean kids worried that parents will see a video of them drunk or something they typically have accounts the parents doesn't know about or they are on a different website as well that parents don't use like twitter or something 




 it's actually much cheaper to get drunk

chateau d'cardboard $12-$20,
cheap vodka (or bourbon etc)- $22-$30,
bottle of cheap wine - $10-$20,
6 pack beer $16

weed is $20 a gram $50 for 3 and typically around $80-$110 a quarter

a kid can get a cask of goon and a 6 pack of beer cheaper than they can get 2 grams of weed

 




 most people are going to be in support of this

we all have ID on us all the time anyway if you drive, most people keep ID in their wallet (even if they don't drive) and always have it on them so whats the big problem that a cyclist needs to have it 




 because people just don't like them and think they are a bunch of loonies

people will always vote labor/liberals reguardless of the shit they do because they don't want the greens in power

this is highly unlikely to ever change 




 it will never happen 




 that's a great way to get fucked with by the cops especially if it's a shitty area

why are you running etc etc.. you'll get searched and have your time wasted or probably shot if you're in America 




 ugly as hell 




 10 year old's know fuck all about the world and the current situation with the government

it's pretty clear the parents pushed him to do it 




 this!

voters don't want boat people which is one of the main reasons Howard and Abbott were able to win

no matter how loud the support refugee people are the vast majority don't want them and will vote for the party that tries to stop it
