 Only in a liberal's world is regulation called freedom. 




 Don't worry.  Job applications have been sent to ISIS so they will cancel these plans. 









 The petulant boy king speaks... 




 The Patriot Act wasn't about patriotism. It was about control.

The Affordable Care Act wasn't about affordability.  It was about control.

Net Neutrality isn't about neutrality.  It's about control.


Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn't pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same, or one day we will spend our sunset years telling our children and our children's children what it was once like in the United States where men were free. 
-Ronald Reagan

 




 Those pesky facts are finally surfacing.

But, like Jay Carney said 9 months after our men fought for their lives all night long as no fingers were lifted in Washington,

 Liberals love the 14th amendment, equal protection under the law, except when it applies to the rich.

Then they want to apply disproportionately high income tax rates on people simply because they make more money.
 









 Yes, the Third World is colonizing the United States.  If you oppose this, you are "racist". 




 There are many sources who say Morsi was not legitimately elected and was chosen to appease the MB.  

But that's nice of you to support a terrorist dictator who immediately begin attacking non-Muslim minorities when he began to rule.

 




 "The tensions between the two nations have escalated in the last 18 months after the Obama administration suspended the sale of certain weapons to Cairo in the wake of the Muslim Brotherhood leaders removal from the presidential office in Egypt."

Yes, Obama supports the terrorism-connected Muslim Brotherhood.
It really can't be any more obvious.
 














 No one has a Constitutional right to buy flowers from you. This is not a freedom of speech issue for the couple. 




 The US Congress was not involved here.  Did you read the article? Having the Legislative branch of the federal govt involved in the sale of a bouquet of flowers between private citizens would be the antithesis of the Constitution and any notion of a free state. 




 Who are really the intolerant ones here?

 When you begin your quest to become an American citizen by evading federal and state authorities you should not be allowed to become a citizen. 




 The IRS targeted conservative, American citizens wholesale and Congress did nothing.

Obama enacted executive amnesty to increase the Democrat voter base and Congress did nothing.

There are no more statesmen in Washington DC to represent us, only politicians. 









 Don't worry, it has a nice, cozy word like "neutrality" in it.  What could be so bad about it?  /s

 But....Bush!!! 




 The "most transparent administration in US history".

Riiiiiiiiiight. 




 Obama saying something else is Bush's fault?  When will he start leading?
He is one who **provided ISIS with TOW missiles**.

Also, is there any **single one thing** that Obama likes about America?

This man is not fit to lead a kindergarten teeball team.  He should be put in handcuffs and removed from office. 




 And Democrats want the federal govt in charge of the health system. 














 This is what happens when governments run schools. 




 "The most transparent administration in history."

Yet another lie. 









   United States has been heavily arming an apartheid state that has WMD.

Ahhh, to be young and naive again.
 




 That's easy to say when terrorists aren't firing artillery into your neighborhood. 




 Anthropomorphic global warming is a farce and a political movement to undermine Western capitalist nations.

Devastating periods of climate activity are going to happen, with or without humans present. Consider the ice ages. Glaciers several kilometers thick formed and moved thousands of miles, crushing everything in their paths. There is no scientist on earth that can tell you why this occurred.  There were several interglacial periods of warming, where ice was rapidly melting.   We are probably in one of those periods now.  


Even the founder of Greenpeace stated before Congress there is no scientific evidence of anthropomorphic global warming.   

Relax, the sky's not falling. We don't need more govt control to avert another fake crisis. Sound familiar? 




 Democrats have expanded the federal government every chance they've had.

Obama voters: You've made your bed. Now lie in it. 




 They are not going to release the account number of the US Treasury. 




 You know what I call people who rob stores? 

Thugs. 









 Paging Al "The ice caps could be gone by 2014" Gore. 









 Just because you post things on the Internet doesn't make them true.
Obama is on the verge of enabling a nuclear Iran.  Yes even Democrats are jumping ship on this one.

 Please tell me how a nuclear-capable Iran is patriotic and good for America. 









 Health care costs started rising when the federal government got involved with Medicare.  Put the govt out of the equation and market forces will work things out.

Edit: Market equilibrium would never allow a $50 aspirin. Govt intervention  through Medicare is how this initially happened.  Why is the British national pastime queuing? The inefficiencies and bureaucracies of Socialism. 




 Obama is a naive idealogue..  It is fucking insane that we are negotiating to allow a nuclear capable Iran. 




 I read the letter and think it was a great idea. 




 So any criticism of her action is bigotry? It's racism? 
That card is old, worn and a weak argument. 









 But the earth was supposed to be out of crude oil by now.

The polar bears were supposed to be gone unless we curbed energy expansion.

The ice caps were supposed to be gone by now unless we stopped using fossil fuels. 

Acid rain was supposed to destroy the world unless we stopped building factories.

The hole is the ozone layer was supposed to heat the earth unless we stopped using aerosol.

Deforestation was going to destroy the rain forest unless we curtailed Western Civilization's footprint on the earth.

The sky was supposed to fall unlesss we repealed capitalism and submitted all economic control to the state. 




 The intolerance of the left strikes again. 









 Yes. How else do you think ISIS got their hands on TOW missiles they are seen using in their propaganda videos?  

Standing with the muslims? Yes we can!

 They won't stop until they control all facets of our lives.  Tyranny isn't coming in the front door wearing a white hood.  It is coming in the back under the guise of green living. 














 "The lunches are heavily subsidized by the Government"

So these lunches really aren't 60 cents. Someone is paying for them and probably at a high markup/overhead considering they are government funded. 




 Wake up Reddit!  Don't buy this!  Why would Obama support a nuclear Iran?  They have stated the *intention* to "wipe Israel off the map".  Israel is a free and Democratic nation unlike Iran where homosexuals are hanged.

It's unbelievable that any American supports Iran or negotiations with them.  The fact that Obama and Kerry are so passive and even supportive of Russia and Iran is indicative of ethical collapse. 









 But the shooters were such good boys. They DinDuNuffin. 




 Where do you get this reality from?  Most likely you are not a climate scientist, so you get your 'reality' about our climate from a little rectangular screen that tells you what to think,

 "I'll have more flexibility after the election."
Barack Hussein Obama to Russian president

Charge him with treason. 




 If you think government is more accountable than the private sector you're going to have a bad time. 




 "Hiding profits in tax havens is one of the most common ways large corporations avoid paying their fair share to the IRS."

You know what's not fair?  Working hard to get somewhere and having to provide free housing, Obama phones, food stamps, disability, education and health care to people who sit around and smoke weed all day.  Most low to medium income people don't understand this because they pay little, none or even negative tax.

Rewarding the unsuccessful and punishing the successful is an unsustainable economic proposition. 




 Don't you mean Russia's actions in Crimea make it very possible? 




 Why is the Secretary of State running a charity while in office? The potential for corruption is high with this one. 









 More excuses for the lies and corruption of the Democrat party.  You will make a good serf. 









 More nonchalance from the Democrat semen chuggers of Reddit. Your nonstop excuses for Democrat lies and corruption will be a double edged sword. 




 More gargling of Democrat semen by Reddit.  
If a Democrat commits a crime, not a big deal.  The rule of law is not important here, just whims of the mob. 




 You now carry a burden so others don't have to. 


































 The root of the global warming movement lies in a big government, anti-capitalist ideology.  When global warming was discredited by data, they swiftly changed to climate change.

Climate change is not about the environment but, like most left of center ideas, it's about societal control and the repeal of capitalism. 




 I'd rather have wrong ideas than outlawed ideas.

Q: Why did we send an unarmed drone and not fighter jets that were **one hour away** in Italy?

Q: Why did Obama go to bed and then fly to Las Vegas for a fundraiser the next morning, all while the Ambassador's whereabouts were unknown?

 It's good to see the State Dept has time to tweet in between their arms shipments to ISIS. 









 The only thing wrong about this article is the number.  There are 20+ million illegals in the US. Since Obama's executive amnesty and his orders to cease deportations and even apprehensions, they are pouring in.  

Third world status?

Yes we can! 




 They most certainly will not be deported for voting. 









 How about deporting people that have broken our laws and not paid a dime of income tax? 




 Don't you know who occupies 1600 Pennsylvania Ave?

 He tried to tax everything that moved in Maryland and it failed miserably.  We need someone who understands that businesses create prosperity and a welfare check doesn't. 









 Title is misleading. 

"Rohl, Dents attorney, contends that a close review of a video released this week shows Melendez pulling a bag of drugs from his pocket."

So his attorney contends this.  Where is the video? 




 Good for Indiana.

If I start a business, I should be able to decide who I do business with.  This whole politically correct mandate from the left is an obtrusive overreach.

We are free citizens not subjects. 









 The Democrat Party would have you believe that evil like this doesn't exist anymore.

They are naive and dangerous in any position involving national security. 



















 Iran will kill millions of innocent civilians when they obtain a nuclear weapon.  War will rage across the Middle East, Europe and possibly further.

But who cares?  We have a cool, mixed president and aren't racist and stuff. 














 When you funnel money through any government program, this happens.

After hundreds of billions of dollars of tax money, why are private schools still better than public? They operate on their own money so there is much more accountability and incentive to perform. 




 Except 50 cent wasn't shot with an AK-47. 




 Because nothing measures pure success in life quite like a great "Reddit track record". 




 Contrary to what they would have you believe, the Democrat party is really a party of elitism. 









 If you stacked the entire 2015 Department of Education budget in new one dollar bills it would reach from Los Angeles to New York....and back.

Do you think further increases of funding are going to

a) increase our students' performance or 

b) line the pockets of "administrators" and bureaucrats? 




 We already spend **HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS** of dollars on the Dept of Education.  It is a collosal failure and a demonstration of the inadequacies of central government bureaucracy.

We won two world wars without the DOE.

We put people on the moon without the DOE.

We invented the Internet without the DOE.

What have we done since the DOE?  We've sank to the lowest level education-wise of all first world countries. 

Abolish the DOE and give control of education back to the people.  We'll be just fine without it and billions of dollars richer. 




 Obama snuggling up with Iran.  Does he have to make it any more obvious?  He has never said one good word about America  and praises Islam every chance he gets.

The emperor is wearing no clothes.

 Humble pie.

 Politically correct cowards of Reddit, put your heads back in the sand and keep telling yourself that the true evil in the world comes from white, Western capitalists.  









 These things are inseparable from massive, centralized government programs.
We will learn this the hard way. 




 Bureaucracy? Red tape? Queueing? Rationing? Inefficiency?

 It's ironic that someone with thousands of dollars of tattoos is flying across the world to threaten third world people that are driven to poaching simply to feed their families. 




 Why don't you go first? 




 Because a corporate tax rate of 40% will not create economic growth or jobs. 




 Why should I pay a higher percent of my income simply because I make more money?  

The progressive tax system is in obvious violation of the fourteenth amendment.  A different law is being applied to someone simply because they make more money.

Everyone should pay the same percent of their income.

 And Obama golfs on. 









 Obama has vowed to find the evil, white Tea Party members responsible. 









 A campaign donation is far different than a payment to an elected official.

If our citizens think it's okay for the Secretary of State to run a charity that accepts donations from foreign governments then we are in trouble. 









 He was just murdering the women that Americans wouldn't murder themselves. 




 All prosperity in our nation comes from the private sector, through the 'evil' employers. Your god, the state, does not create any jobs, drive innovation or provide a sustainable path for people to leave poverty.

Government does not produce economic growth, private business does. 




 Vacations and pensions are benefits, not rights. 




 You're right.  John Kerry siding with America's enemies is not news.

 Obama and Holder are sending delegations to Iraq to ensure ISIS has not been subjected to civil rights abuses.


Oh, and to make sure our TOW missiles we gave them are still working. 




 The idea that rights come from a god means that no earthly person, group or government should be allowed to deny your basic rights.

 Democrats want to get money out of politics, provided that money is for Republicans.

 Iran now clear to build nuclear weapons.  Russia invading Ukraine and just boldly hacked into our systems yet again.  China will soon make an effort to retake Taiwan militarily.  Islamic extremism is growing unchecked and even condoned in areas of the Middle East.


But who cares?  Obama made sure his bracket it filled out and his talk show appearances and golf are on the schedule. He's a hip, non-white guy and we aren't racist and stuff.  Plus he like promises us free stuff from those evil rich people.  That's all that matters. 









 If these people were wanted for assault, why not provide a description? 




 Iran with nuclear weapons?

 Yes and its up to the company to enforce it,  not the government.

Iran has expressly stated they will "destroy Israel" and will start a nuclear war.

Millions of innocent people will die, but who cares?  We have a cool President that appears on Jimmy Kimmel.

Color me shocked. 
























 Congratulations.  You've found the difference in incentive betwen the government and private sector.

A business operates off its own money and thus has the incentive to perform and be accountable.

The government doesn't operate off it's own money and the employees do not have any motivation to be accountable or even perform at all.

 Ignorant liberal outrage against Nestle.

Ignorant liberal outrage against Nestle.  




 You do realize that George Bush has not been President for 7 years? 














 Do you approve of donations from a Russian company to the Clinton foundation while Hillary signed off on uranium rights for that **exact same company**?

If this is a popular stance, to condone corruption of one party, this country is in trouble. 




 Can someone explain to me why a random company in Russia would donate to the Clinton Foundation? 




 Liberals want "money out of politics",  provided that money is not foreign money going to the Clinton Foundation to influence policy decisions. 




 This is not a valid reason for not sending fixed wing air support as there would be very little risk to the pilots.

Again, why was no force ordered to support the surrounded force on the ground?
Why was no force ordered to spin up *at all*?

This fight went on **all night long**. For those hours and hours no one was ordered to even simply get ready to go in. 




 "Several press reports surfaced Thursday saying Clintons department signed off on the sale of uranium rights in the U.S. to a Russian company, while the Clinton Foundation was receiving donations from that company. President Bill Clinton was also given a $500,000 speaking fee in Russia."

Outright corruption to anyone with common sense.

 Your reasoning fails basic logic.


If you call the fire department and tell them your house is on fire, they will never say "It will take too long to get there and your house will be burned down by then, so we won't come at all."

No force was *ever* sent.  Why?
 




 Here is the Democrat playbook for scandals.

1. Deny, stonewall, deny, stonewall, etc.
2. When evidence finally surfaces in spite of Democrat obstruction, say "it happened a long time ago."

Sorry Obama, Hillary and Carney....the truth is timeless. 




 All of these attacks took place in sovereign nations with responding security forces.  In these cases, unilateral intervention would be more difficult politically.  Libya, however, was in a state of civil war and unilateral action would have been the *only* security response.

Who is the only one person in the USA who can authorize military action in another nation?

Why was no rescue force ever sent while our people were in a siege and getting killed?

Why were fixed wing aircraft resting on a tarmac one hour away(Italy) never scrambled?

We did however manage to send an *unarmed* Predator.  Why did we prioritize the launch of an unarmed Predator over fixed wing assets with real bombs?

Why was the attack blamed on a video despite there being no evidence of this?

How did the White House/media know **immediately** the motivations of attackers in the middle of the night 8,000 miles away in a war torn country?  What source did they use for this?  Did they interview people?  How did they know this?

Why was a low ranking person, Susan Rice, paraded out on talk shows to blame this attack on a video?  Why not have someone that is formally in charge actually address the nation first?

TLDR: Our men fought all night long, while no one in Washington lifted a finger. The White House made up a story about a video, since this was mid-election and a terrorist attack would have been bad for Obama.

 It's hardly a kneejerk but is a stance founded in the principle of equal treatment of all. 

You want to treat children differently because of their race.

 As usual, the liberals of Reddit do not wish to discuss the content of the article, only to attack the source and mock opposing viewpoints like good little Stalinists.

 Yeah, let's ban different viewpoints! /s

 'The claim is just as bogus now'

The article has actual accounts of businesses closing as a direct result of the minimum wage hike.

 This is insight that reveals a truth the American left does not understand: You can't control market forces and human nature through legislation. 




  When one business closes, another opens - happens everyday.

In this case, the new business opening will be in a different, more business friendly state. 




 Democrats have yet to understand that prosperity does not come from thin air.  It is created by business.

This wage hike, as many of us already know, will crush 100's of small businesses and increase unemployment.

  I think this would be a wonderful opportunity to pause for a moment and give thanks for the many great contributions of the Democratic-voting black community and their culture to our society.

Their peaceful and generous nature make them ideal neighbors, lending testimony to their exceptional family values and parenting skills unrivaled by any other culture.
Their commitment to academic excellence enriches our schools and serves as an example to all who hope to achieve prominence as a people.

Real estate values are fueled by the influx of African Americans into an area due to their caring and respectful nurturing of these communities, an example of all they have achieved by their enthusiasm for self improvement through hard work and a self-reliant can-do nature.

Without their industrious and creative drive, we would be poorer as a nationpresently enriching the cities of Spokane WA, Chicago IL, Philadelphia PA, Washington D.C., St. Louis MO, New Orleans LA, Los Angeles CA, Flint MI, Baltimore MD, Pontiac MI, Newark NJ, Cleveland OH, Atlanta GA, Richmond VA, Memphis TN, Birmingham AL, Camden NJ; and lets not forget Detroit, MI, the tourism capital of the world!

 There is no rational reason that someone can't make it to the polls, which are usually open for 12 hours on election day, if they wish to vote.

Does it take longer than 12 hours for Democrats to travel to their neighborhood polling center?

Get up early.

Vote on your lunch break.

Vote after work. 

Vote anytime if you don't work.

Some states actually require employers to give you time off to vote!  

There is absolutely no legitimate reason for early voting.


 




 Early voting is actually a relatively new thing.  

From Wikipedia, which I have not confirmed:



History of early voting in U.S. presidential elections

Year	Early votes

2008	30.6%

2004	22%
	
2000	16%

1992	7%
 




 I don't base my stances on if something is a "terrible thing" or not.

"The Congress may determine the Time of chusing [sic] the Electors, and **the Day** on which they shall give their Votes; which Day shall be the same throughout the United States."" 




 Because making everyone vote on the same day is racist.   /s


Edit: The founding fathers decided on one day for elections.  This was before cars, trains, etc.  Yet one single day for elections was deemed okay. 

Ask yourself, why are the Democrats so opposed to only accepting votes on one day?

"Social security" was private before it was public.  It used to be called being responsible and saving for your future.  Now that we've involved the federal government, this "safety net" will soon be insolvent.

 The Constitutional concept of checks and balances is considered a racist, old fashioned idea on /r/politics....until a conservative is President. 




 Hillary would never have the courage to do this. 




 Of course not.  It's just another Clinton coincidence. 




 The Constitution clearly says anyone holding office cannot accept money from a foreign state.  It's cut and dry.

If we hadn't been wiping our asses with the Constitution for the past 50 years, Hillary would already be in prison. 




 Hillary Clinton has committed crimes, but watch the stream of excuses from the Reddit Democrats.

 But...but..all the super smart redditors say that immigrants who begin their stint in America by evading federal authorities will actually be peaceful, productive citizens.

Trump was right. 




 The progressive left will side with radical Islam over Christians.  You can take that to the bank.  It's already happening in Europe  









 Another example of progressive totalitarianism, where even children are subjects of the omnipotent state.

 If a black/gay/liberal person was beaten at a Tea Party rally on video the state run media would be orgasming 24/7.

Everyone is equal, but some are more equal. 




 Beaten for holding a sign. 

The left is very tolerant, given you have the same opinion as them. 









 Anti-NRA liberals who say they own guns are like people who say they have a black friend to prove they aren't racist.

It's a desperate and pathetic plea for legitimacy. 




 No one here even knows what Trump said that was so offensive.

Everything he said is true.

 




 What exactly did Trump say that was so offensive? 









 9 out of 10 redditors have no clue what Trump said.

What he said was fact.  Trump is on target and that's why the left is so hyperdefensive about this.
 




 Correct. Liberals are usually humanists. Nothing is more important to them than their own whims. Kids and fetuses be damned. 




 He did not pull out of Afghanistan.

75% of military casualties and 92% of Marine casualties in Afghanistan have occurred under Obama.

 



















 You know it's actually okay to not believe in something but recognize people's Constitutional right to it?

American progressives seem to have a problem separating what they personally believe and what they believe should be a federal mandate  




 This is the Stalinism of the American left and it is only getting worse. 









 They are millions of separate lone wolves with a coincidental religious preference! 




 Once you start banning symbols bad things happen.

The somersaults of statutory interpretation they have performed (penalty means tax, further [Medicaid] payments to the State means only incremental Medicaid payments to the State, established by the State means not established by the State) will be cited by litigants endlessly, to the confusion of honest jurisprudence. And the cases will publish forever the discouraging truth that the Supreme Court of the United States favors some laws over others, and is prepared to do whatever it takes to uphold and assist its favorites." 




 And the "Give me my free stuff" crowd goes wild.

The Republic has 30 years left, max. 




 Massive child rape by Muslim immigrants coming soon to a neighborhood near you! 









 Because the Confederacy was like the worst thing that happened ever in history bro.  




 Are there any symbols out there that don't offend anyone at all?
 














 Celebrate Diversity!! 




 The Gadsden flag, a symbol of the American revolution, is already reviled by the left.

It will be next, because it's somehow "racist".

All non-conformist thought will be deemed racist, banned and the purveyor will be "re-educated". 




 Just like bakers are free to regulate the content of the cakes they create? 




 The left is showing their true fascist tendencies on this one.

Don't ignore it, turn it off, change the channel, try to debate it.

If you disagree with it, ban it! 









 What flag do we ban to stop the EPIDEMIC of black on white violence in the US? 




 "The future does not belong to those who slander the prophet of Islam."

-Barack Hussein Obama 









 Sanders is an outright communist and will not win a general election.

By all means, support him in the Democrat primary!

-Your local conservative 




 Not with that attitude. 




 In other shocking news, the Reddit mob doesn't criticize the actions of someone doing a job they have no clue about. 




 You are so naive. 




 "Bring the human population down"

Why don't we start with you? 




 College kids: They are unaware they are unaware. 




 Has Jon Stewart figured out the difference between the national deficit and the national debt yet?

Don't get your politics from an entertainer. 




 Unbeknownst to the naive college students of Reddit:

Sanders can not win a general election.

Hillary can not win a general election.

Keep pushing for them, please! 




 We do have a real problem.  

We prescribe  SSRIs to children. 




 The FCC, making up Constitutional powers as they go.  














 I'm really enjoying the Obamabots doing logic somersaults trying to change the meaning of this sentence.

**"At some point we have to reckon with the fact that this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries."** 




 You do know the 'Americas' is referring to North and South America? 




 The left loves to discriminate against people based on their income. 




 There have been plenty of spree killers in other countries.  From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rampage_killers):

Africa/Middle East	85

Americas	107

Asia	127

Europe	94

Oceania/Maritime Southeast Asia	124

Has Barack Obama **ever** said anything nice about America? 









 That very policy would have prevented the Boston Marathon bombing. 




 But just think of all the cultural enrichment they'll provide! 









 This is more naive liberal outrage over a reality that conflicts with their worldview of fuzzy unicorns.

For some strange reason, Reddit was silent about Obama using the term "typical white person" in his book. 




 Democrats do this all the time.  Reddit is silent. 




 And the left's revision of history continues.

Can't have any of those evil white men being idolized any more. 




 Funny.  There is criticism of Trump on Reddit, but no criticism of Elizabeth "I have high cheekbones so I can lie about my Native American ancestry" Warren.
