 My shower was going normally...and then I had the bright idea to try and shave in a stand up shower. This may sound risky in itself but I've done it before so I thought I was a certified pro at it. So, the arm pits happen without a hitch but then I start on more risky territory. As I'm finishing up  I'm realizing the quality of my razor isn't totally on the up and up. I only paid $6 for 3 so I should've known. But, here we are. I have a partially shaved butt and a bleeding finger. And to top it all off band-aids don't stick to anything wet, so I ended up getting blood all over my towel trying to get out of the shower. The worst part is it all happened at my boyfriend's house. 

*As a side note, my finger took the brunt of the damage from the razor because the damn thing was so flimsy and cheaply put together the replaceable head comes off without any warning.  




 I actually didn't do it for any significant reason...I just like how it looks pointing that way.  









 Thanks for the input! I think you're right. I'm definitely going to cross hatch the color to try to improve it!  




 thanks! I'll give that a try!  









 Just a quick drawing! Hope you like it! http://imgur.com/eAoiBMk 




 Thank you! :) I've never heard of those, I'll have to check it out!  




 No problem! And thank you! :) It actually was, I worked at it over a few day span so it was a fun end to the day. haha. :D  









 I'm actually so pleased with how this came out, I really hope you like it! http://imgur.com/SXzt8zB 




 Hey, it's just a quick little pen sketch with minimal color...and the quality is a little off because I'm lacking a scanner...(a.k.a I took this with my phone) sigh. I hope you like it though! :) http://imgur.com/vwE5kwi 




 I'm glad you like it! And you're very welcome!! 




 It's just a quick pen sketch with a little bit of color...I thought it would still be worth posting. Hope you like it! http://imgur.com/Bgob3O9

 Drew a quick sketch, it came out a bit blurry in the picture...I hope you like it though! http://imgur.com/NA7BrEJ 




 Thank you so much! It's wonderful, I absolutely love the vibrant colors :) 




 I did a quick drawing with marker and black pen...I really hope she likes it! http://imgur.com/Y8fTvyN

 I actually just checked the map and there doesn't seem to be anyone in my area on that map either! The closest to NS is Quebec! :o 




 ohhhhh awesome!  




 No, I'm located in Halifax, NS, Canada!! I definitely can't afford to travel that far!  




 I'm having no luck finding a person or salon in my area that would install syn dreads and I just ordered a set. Eeeeek. Not sure if it's okay to post this type of thing but I need help and no one I know has dreads... 




 thanks! 




 Thanks! I'm drawing every spare moment I have!! haha.(Although that isn't much as I have had a summer job and I'm in an intensive IT program) I'm focusing on dot work designs lately. I find they turn out the best. I've been trying to focus on tattoo-able designs.  I actually did have an artist in mind and got a side tattoo from him but he's never taken on an apprentice...I'm thinking once I'm back to the city I'll go in and talk to someone from the same shop. 
Thanks again for the advice! 




 I'm working on a portfolio to take in and I have a shop in mind but I know nothing about how I should go about it besides that...I'm also very nervous about taking in my portfolio. I feel as though it could never be good enough as I have no actual experience tattooing and I haven't had any training besides advanced high school courses. I really need to also mention that my art isn't "photo realistic" I have a graphical/2D kind of style to my work. Any advice would be very appreciated!  




 thanks! :) 




 I'm looking at starting to use baking soda and ACV instead of shampoo and conditioner...Any really good recipes out there? That are more than the basic mix? Like something with tea tree oil etc. I'd really appreciate any advice I can get on this.  




 sweet, thanks! 




 I'm in Canada so that sucks! haha. and nice!  




 Hmmm, is that in US dollars or CND?  




 That's true, thank you. I was thinking fruits and vegetables, as well as oatmeal without sweet flavoring added would be good places to start. I'm hoping to keep my diet as low carb as possible. And I'm pretty small/female. So my MAX calorie intake is about 1400.  




 But I honestly can't stick to it right now. I just can't sit down, figure out my macros and then plan my grocery shopping and meals off of that. I'm not good at meal prep. That's the main problem I'm having so I'm trying to find foods that are easily prepared. I'm also looking into nutrition bars. But, quest bars are out of my price range at  $40 per 12. so...I'm hoping there's a better alternative. I really appreciate any tips or advice I'm given. I'm still very new to trying to lead a healthy active lifestyle.  




 okay, thanks!  




 Hmmm, its starting to sound like it's worth just waiting til my hair grows out! Do you know if the dreads were successful at 6-8 inches? Like did they end up keeping them and having them look good? 




 my hair doesn't even curl on its own. Even when I don't comb it, no joke. It's crazy straight and fine. 
 




 thank you for the input! I'm still thinking I'll grow my hair out and try to get natural ones in the future. My hair is way too short for that right now though unfortunately. Parts of my hair are only 3 inches. For some reason shaving it seemed like a good idea.  




 I love the look of dreadlocks, I've been trying to grow my hair out to get them forever now. I haven't managed to do it but I'm thinking synthetic dreads would be a good alternative for me because I'm a Caucasian girl with thin/straight hair too. I'm wondering a few things about getting them...Such as how long should my existing hair be in order to put them in? And where should I typically go to get them put in? I've called a few places that offer extensions but no one there knows anything about putting in synthetic dreads...I know a few people that can dread actual hair would they have an easy time putting in syn ones?  
























 Last time I got a BMI test done at my ymca that included a body fat percentage...It was around 24.1% and my waist is around 27 inches. So, according to that I'd be average.  




 I will be honest with you, I do not like what I see in the mirror most days. It's easy for me to pick out the flaws instead of 'good parts'. And I don't receive compliments very often.  




 My BMI is 23.4, which is on the higher side of normal weights based on the calculator I used...Now, I'm 5'1...124 lbs...and I'm a 19 year old female...Is this a normal weight for my height and age? I've been made to feel like its not by most BMI calculators etc. I also gained a lot of weight in the past year...I started community college last year and gained 20 lbs. I used to be 110, so I've lost about 6 lbs since I gained weight. I think this might be why I'm so worried about my weight but I'm interested in getting opinions as mine may be biased. Any advice is appreciated.  









 I find after 2 coats its looks opaque on my nails, I absolutely love it...Maybe try a clear coat over top if you're finding it too thin?  




 the ring and pinky finger designs look a little busy but besides that I think they look absolutely lovely. :)  









 Yeah, I'm learning its better just to do it myself! haha, mine don't turn out every time but atleast I'm only paying out for polish and remover! I totally agree with you, I'd feel soo bad if I couldn't give someone exactly what they wanted for their mani. I'm sure your nails always look beautiful, they definitely do in the now picture! :)  




 Same!!! The red I used for dots bleeds too so that definitely didn't help things. haha. 




 Yeah, you're definitely right...I didn't wait long enough for it to dry...I thought I did but I didn't. And I didn't have any clear coat besides glitter. I know for next time though! In hindsight I should've left them white with the purple and pink middle piece. It looked tidy.  









 I paid $70 for a mani and it looked like the then...Except she couldn't even do designs and she was the only in house nail 'artist'....One of the nails broke in half on me 2 days later...She told me it was gel and that it could only come off with an electric file or acetone remover...I basically filed it off after one of them broke... 




 I found leaving mine alone and not painting them for about a week or less always got rid of it.  




 No problem! And I am too, it's a really shitty experience for her to have during her second tattoo...I told her most artists aren't like that and everything and she seemed to get it but I'm sure she's holding off on getting more for awhile.  




 yeah, she moved once...told the artist it really tickled and apologized for moving and then stayed still.  




 Also, my friend is 18 and still fairly new to being tattooed so...she does have a bit of leeway in my mind...  




 She was a guest artist so I don't think I'll ever see her around again. But, if anyone asks me about my opinion of her ever I'll keep chode in mind as a describing word.  




 Admittedly she was, I cringed at her behaviour and didn't encourage it at all, but it still didn't justify the reaction from the artist in my opinion. She's even been  tattooed before and wasn't an annoying client at all. I was honestly very surprised by both of them but I expected the artist to react in a professional manor.   




 I will try to get a picture, its my friend's tattoo though so I don't have any on hand. lol.  




 I thought so, but I wanted to make sure! haha, I do too definitely left a bad taste in my mouth.  
























 I'm looking for advice on how to improve my current make up or what to buy and how to use it based on my features and skill level which is very beginner...The first two pictures are me with make-up the last is without...I currently use: 

foundation: rimmel London stay matte primer, Maybelline dream fresh bb, and an organic brand loose powder.

eye: bonne bell eyeliner in black, cover girl eyeenhancers shadow in sombre relzadora which is white with sparkle, covergirl lashblast fusion.

brows: flamingo brow pencil in light brown...its an off brand Asian company I believe.  









 Mine have gone back after decent sized stretches, I stretched mine 3 times so far...The first time they shrunk back to 8g in 2 days...the second time they shrunk back to 8g in 3 days...and I'm currently still on the third stretch...Actually I went to a 00g all 3 times...it is possible for certain people...everybody has different skin elasticity and heals differently.  




 That sounds awesome! Thank you!  




 Do you think your friend would be willing to consider taking on doing a strangers? lol. I'm having no luck, and I'm not talented enough to do them myself. 




 Does anyone on this page know how or know someone who does... that is located near or in Halifax, Nova Scotia? 




 Thank you! :) 




 I didn't have any help what so ever, it took me 3 hours the first time...But, I've gone back and put in double elastics so I'd say 4-4.5...lol 




 Hmmm, that is odd. And thank you! :) I definitely will, I've gotten so many compliments since then that I honestly can't even believe it...People I don't even know have stopped me in person just to tell me they look good. I really appreciate your comment, its really nice to receive more positivity than negativity. :) 




 I doubt theres enough people for it to catch on, and I'm glad you're not...However, I posted them here and received down votes etc. And was basically told I would continue to be down voted just a heads up...ahah. I joined r/FancyFollicles  




 Thanks! And yes, they are...They're handmade by Heather at Divinity Dreads. She's amazing...And I went with the synth route because I have very short hair at the moment, I have thin, straight hair, and I wasn't sure if they would suit me so I thought a non committed approach would work best for me! And these locs are a million times nicer than anything I could achieve naturally...mine would look like braids 




 Its okay, these are not dread falls though...They're extensions that braid in and they are natural colors so they blend with my normal hair...They essentially look like dreads. 




 I'm pretty sure having synth dreads doesn't make me goth...you're either really rude or a frigging trollll. They literally look like real dreads except I'm honest enough to say they're not.... 




 Well, the shampoo seems to be sulfate free...and actually after buying the conditioner I stopped using it almost immediately because the one I bought doesn't say its cone or sulfate free...it only says color and parabens...But thank you for the input! :)  









 Is this shampoo free from enough chemicals(parabeans, silicone, color, etc) that its good to use on dreads or instead of going shampoo free? 









 I guess I could've phrased it a lot better...but I posted to a fitness sub reddit because I was hoping I could get better advice that way. If I just wanted to feel better about myself I would've posted something to facebook or somewhere similar.  




 Actually I was wondering if it is the best way to measure my fat to weight ratio and what range I fall under. It is not about feeling better about myself emptily. I am still exercising and trying to lose the weight and I intend to continue with it. No matter what response I got I intended to keep exercising. I honestly just want to know the best way to calculate this sort of thing so that I can measure my progress...Because there's really no physical difference yet as far as muscle etc.  




 Thanks! :) I really do want to work on tone and building muscle so I will continue to try but I feel much better about my current weight now.  
























 I definitely get that he needs to get help for his bipolar disorder...and that other people could love those qualities. 

He doesn't call me names or do anything like that...

However, I see your point and appreciate your honesty. 




 Its for Information Technology and I'm thinking a deep red heel and deep red or black blouse... 




 My mom is a hairdresser and basically the low down on clarifying shampoo is that it shouldn't be used twice and its to remove impurities such as chlorine...

It shouldn't be used regularly and is actually really hard on your hair. 

Kind of feel like I'm missing the context of why your hair dresser told you this...Although, even if you switched colors to blonde or lighter a 'blonde shampoo' is a better choice.   




 The lather from shampoo actually isn't a good measure of anything as its all chemically created...I use dread shampoo and the lather is very very minimal and consistent because it doesn't contain these chemicals...Even Sulfate free shampoos typically have other chemicals in them...

My hair acts much better and the natural oils in my hair are not stripped from washing daily. Because I use natural oil based dread shampoo, which comes in a bar like soap..It doesn't strip any oil. Its all about what you're using.

 




 This has happened to me too recently...I've been on Marvelon 21 for over 2 years and now that I'm taking it continuously it seems very very useless. 22 days and 3 doctor's appointments/clinic visits later my period got to be over. Beyond terrible and my family doctor won't switch me to anything else. 




 She isn't a specialist but I don't really understand the difference between a specialist and a gyno/surgeon...There's only one specialist close to my area in the listings here(Halifax/Nova Scotia) and I can't find any info for him when I click the link...

And thank you for the well wishes!  




 Thank you for the advice and well wishes, I'll look into heating pads for sure! 

I know what you mean about exercise, I lose my energy very quickly. And its super frustrating because I used to be an athlete and now yoga is hard. But, I'm going to keep at it. 

 I'll try to keep physio in mind if/when I get a diagnosis.  




 I've been taking fish oil as part of my supplement routine as well as vitamin D.

 I'm actually as it happens lactose intolerant, I do try to have milk alternatives for ice cream and milk but mostly just veer away from it all because I find soy bothers me as well. 

I can see how exercise can help, I'll have to start trying some yoga..

Thanks for the advice and the well wishes, I have an appointment to see a surgeon/gyno on May 29th. Hoping she schedules me for a lap.  




 Thank you very much for the advice, I think you're right...I'll look into doing both of these! It definitely has been taking a toll, 




 I'm in Ns and wondering if this one is still current? I clicked the link in the added section but his name wasn't listed anywhere on the page... 




 Would you mind explaining the difference I'm new to all this... 




 I'm currently being relatively untreated for my endo...I'm taking vimovo(basically naproxen) twice daily 500mg. And taking my birth control continuously with issue...My appointment with my new gyno is in 2 months or so...And I'm in pain daily, low pelvic pain mostly sometimes its leg and back too though. I've been trying to manage my diet, I've cut out coffee, soy, all dairy except cheese, eggs, and started taking supplements, eating fiber, and drinking green tea...Is there anything else I can be doing to help myself? 




 _sinnerbynature 




 just wondering about how to start with this method and the best things to use for combs with back combing and that sort of thing...Does this method typically have a lot of shrinkage? How long should my hair be before I start this method...Is it possible to do your whole head alone? 




 "yurbuds, Ironman inspire series"...They're designed for the gym, and have an optional clip...As well as play, pause, etc buttons built in...The rubber piece that locks them in can be taken off if you want to use them for normal activities...

 









 Aw, thank you! :) My budget isn't great I'm kind of limited to drug store and discount stuff at the moment...I'd really like to keep my everyday look more of a natural kind of thing but I'd really appreciate any other look suggestions you think would like good! I think I just prefer natural where I'm new to make up. I like highlighting my eyes, maybe my cheek bones but I have no idea where to even start on that one. 

I really appreciate that suggestion I'm definitely going to give it a try! I'm picturing it and I think you're right about the definition without harshness...I do find the black liner a little harsh around my eyes. 




 Where can I get NYX products? I live in Canada if that helps...and Thank you so much for the suggestions! :)  




 That sounds very very doable, and hmmm...I will have to look into something a bit cheaper for sure, I'm a student on a budget but I appreciate the suggestion. 
And thank you! :) I find its a bit red without foundation but overall I can't complain. haha.  




 Well, I'm currently a student so the drug store price range is definitely ideal...I'll definitely look into the Maybelline nude palette! Thank you :) And, I have a brush I will use with my eyeshadow...it could probably be better though, lol. I'm not sure what kind of color I should go for with blush...I've never used it as I'm fairly new to make up in general. Thank you so much for the compliments they mean a lot! :) 
I'll look into the lip butters as well, I recently picked up a red lip tint but I'm not too sure about it yet...Its called santa baby from lush...I feel like red is a little too bold can you recommend me a few colors? :)
 
























 Okay, thank you! 




 Did you have to take out all of your jewelry or were non metal materials acceptable and did you need to have dermals removed prior to having a lap preformed? 




 Okay, so I'm also getting an IUD at the same time as the lap and I'm really really nervous. 

So, I'm wondering what the worse parts I need to prepare for are and mostly I'm wondering what people who have been through both think in general...

 




 Cervix area, pelvic area but very deep... I've been tested for everything... Pee, blood, ultrasound... In the process of being diagnosed but my doctor is pretty confident... I'm trying to get a lap done.

Use enough lube for sure. And it hurts almost every time. It's like the worst lottery ever... Less deep positions hurt less obviously but pretty much every one but missionary kills me... And even then, still not pain free  




 Okay, I can work with difficult and my hair is fine and straight so I'm expecting my dreads to be thin  




 I'm looking for any tips, tricks, methods, etc to help with pain during/after sex as its a huge problem for me right now and I haven't gotten into a gyn yet...I'm on Toradol which helps my general pain but sex pain is still horrendous. 

(Its high up, sharp, throbbing/aching, persistent pain at the top.)  




 Is a small flea comb for a dog, metal teeth that are close together and short/fine, suitable for back combing new dreads? (The teeth are about 2 cms long and less than a mm apart) 




 As someone who recently discovered their own bisexuality I'd say its most likely him learning about himself...Its more about discovery and exploring himself and his sexuality...I wouldn't worry that he isn't watching straight porn...

In fact I've found porn to cause trouble in relationships no matter what kind it is...

I'd definitely say that him being bi isn't going to make him cheat on you, it just means that he is attracted to people regardless of gender. He's still the exact same man you've always been with...

May I recommend you head over to r/bisexual for more advice if you  want more opinions of people who have good perspective on this. 

Also, its rather intrusive to go through his history...That's private and I'm sure you wouldn't appreciate it either...Being bisexual isn't a reason to distrust someone 




 Yeah, I still live with them so I think I'll hold off...


And I have no idea its honestly just been that way my whole life... 




 Thank you! If you ever feel the need to talk I'm here too!  




 Thank you so much for the advice!! I think you're right, I'm going to keep taking it very very slow! I think its a really big deal that even my boyfriend knows. 

I really appreciate the advice, it seems like the most realistic perspective I've heard so far for me. 




 I actually have a bi friend and talked about her before it was even a thing for me and it didn't go very well..

My mom said it was probably just a phase and that she would figure that out after high school...That right now she is just being selfish so that she has more people to date. That she hates when people say they're bi...Like can't they just pick one or the other...Its greedy and they're just trying to be promiscuous and trendy. Because it is more accepted people think they are when they're really not.

My dad is quietly judgmental. But, I think he would ultimately accept me for who I am...Its honestly mostly my mom.
 




 I've only told my boyfriend and my two best friends and I'm really really not sure how to tell the rest of the world yet so I thought I'd start with reddit.

I'm 20 and female I've only started openly identifying this year, by this I mean identifying as bi at all...

I'm mostly scared of what people will think, I was raised in a family that had the belief that gay and straight is okay but bi is wrong and greedy and slutty...So, obviously I still worry about what my family, friends, and strangers will say when I tell them. 

Also, still dealing with how I myself feel about it because of this too...

Just wondering how you all coped with coming out and the consequences of it...with friends, boyfriends, girlfriends, family, etc. 




 Also, I don't use any hair products like gel or hairspray at all!! Does wonders too 




 I use a shampoo bar from knotty boy "for dreads" even though my hair isn't dreaded, its natural and amazing. And it makes my hair and scalp feel amazing...As well as soft for my hair...Its completely free of sulfates and silicones as well as any other nasties...

I ordered it off their site and it was around $8 plus shipping which was around $9 to Canada...Its lasted me over 3 months though and I've barely made a dent in it.  




 Thanks! I'm definitely going to look into this!  




 Unfortunately I live in Canada and its very very hard to get a card here...and I'm not 'fully diagnosed' yet..
But I really appreciate the input, I've been wondering if it would be a good option...I smoke recreationally and even that helps a bit. 

 




 Looking for more natural remedies to my pain which is daily and terrible...Naproxen didn't even take away all of it...

Or perphaps a better drug to take...Naproxen did screwy things with my stomach until I switched to Vimovo and its been reeking havoc on my memory for months.  




 Update: we broke up... But I'm already regretting the decision... 




 He's also still adjusting to me being bi because I only came out to him two months ago if that...

It probably does take some getting used to, and most days he's okay with it and actually encouraging.  
























 These are absolutely gorgeous, the level of contrast between the colorful patterns and the black calligraphy. It's just beautiful, the flow of along with the contrast makes them really pop! Is there any inspiration references between the collab or similarities/inspiration in the artists' previous works? 




 It looks as though you've elongated the fingers too much and made the palm of the hand too small it should really be a bit bigger and maybe even extend past the wrist slightly...I could give a better critique if the original photo was also included for reference. 


Also, consider blending the color of the hand's skin tone with the rest of the person's skin tone...Having it all lighter makes it look a bit superimposed... 




 Hey, thanks! I looked on kijiji and managed to not find these. Haha. Thanks! :) 




 I'm located in Halifax, Canada. And I'm looking for someone to dread or help me dread my hair...I have fine hair, naturally pretty straight.


But, I've been residue free for the past 8 months or so...Maybe even longer, I use Knotty Boy and Dollylocks bar shampoos. So, my hair shouldn't be too difficult to dread and I am hoping to use the back combing method and palm rolling. 




 Synthetics can be real hair and can be braided in not glued... 




 Thank you, wishing you a speedy recovery as well!!  




 I did it, and I'm very glad I did... Despite how I'm feeling right now and yesterday... My doctor found two spots of endo. I officially have a diagnosis and some relieve. 
One of the spots was quite deep on the right side. 


Also for anyone who can help it's random but how do you check a merina? I have no idea and can't bend enough to get one currently.  




 Thanks so much for the recommendations! :)  




 It's not the first show to keep the awful parts, I'm not saying its a good thing but shows have been way worse about the exact same issue...And if it was all rainbows and butterflies in these people's lives it wouldn't be worth watching...And the male characters have struggles too...One of the male characters is a closeted homosexual and they show realistic issues about that too...It's not like writers are out to get women. It's not every 3 minutes and in some of the cultures depicted in the show its a really relevant issue...Such as in Korea where Sun the business woman is located...And in the second episode she kicks major ass and continues to in the entire season and even prevails over the assumptions made about her because she is a woman in Korea


Honestly the female characters in this show end up being the most important characters in it. But again, if you want to judge it on the first episode and completely condemn it because its realistic in a way you don't like then by all means.  




 The thing is though...if you think about it the show is realistic in this sense...Women in the world do struggle with that kind of thing, how is it lazy writing to show those issues and then show the very same characters thriving and empowered...I think if you didn't judge the show so harshly in the first episode and gave it a real chance you wouldn't feel this way.


I get that feminism is important and as a woman especially but its a show and its a show that's realistic to how the world is. Especially when it comes to trans women. The issues its depicting here are actually why we need feminism and its not really encouraging the behaviours its depicting...But obviously you're a logical person and you get that...

For example Dexter is about a serial killer but its not telling people they should go out and do that but it gives a realistic depiction of that scenario in most cases... 




 Thank you so much! These look like awesome suggestions! :)  




 Reasonably priced, so probably under 20 to 30... I am currently using all drug store brands except my brow pencil is laura mercier...I'd prefer not to pay $58 for one thing...


But, I mostly just want recommendations of what's good and what works for others 




 Okay, so can someone that is good at make up help me pick out brushes, and good quality make up... I still don't want to go full on glam but right now I'm a noob that only knows how to do brows and basic things like eye shadow. 


Also advice on contouring would be appreciated as well but subtle is best







Edit: my eyes are hazel, my skin tone is pale/milky white, my hair is a light copper color, my brows are light like my hair, and my price range is reasonable...I can't afford to pay $200 to have a a starting amount of make up...
And I do actually have a bit like brow pencil, blush, white shadow, mascara, and one foundation brush...I have foundation but it needs work...I do like to combine liquid(bb cream) and powder foundations. 




 Thank you so much for replying, I will definitely treat myself beforehand...Tuesday is coming so fast I can't believe it.

I've arranged for my boyfriend to look after me afterwards so I'm pretty fortunate to know I won't have to do too much with a week off...But, it was still a worry for sure...

Its good to hear the drugging happens quickly, I'm going to be a ball of nerves at the hospital. But, I definitely realize that you're right...My pain is too bad to prolong this and getting a diagnosis is worth it.

I'm so glad to have gotten supportive and encouraging feedback, it means so much to me.  




 hahaha why in the hell are you looking at this sub then? Don't be a dick bud. 









 Thank you! I'll likely update this post once its done 




 I really really appreciate your input...Your experience makes me feel a lot better...Especially to hear about the energy 3 weeks in because I've been exhausted for the past year and a half since my pain got really bad...It was always there but has intensified to almost constant...


Its even better to hear good things about the Mirena because I'm supposed to be getting one and I already picked it up and that was another source of anxiety for me. 

I'm very thankful that you commented on my post, thank you so so much. It means a lot to hear so much insight. 




 My first lap is this coming Tuesday and I'm really really scared about it. I've cried. I've worried. I've become terrified based on what others have said...

I just really need to hear words of why it was worth it, and positive experiences...I get that its surgery and its going to hurt. I basically just need some comfort from people who can understand my situation. 




 Thank you so much for the response, I called and the lady told me this possibility and then said she couldn't promise anything and hung up on me so this is reassuring. 
























 Dispensaries, sex shops, smoke shops, hookah bars  




 That's awesome!!! :) I'd be interested in the link to your shop!  




 These look like something you would get from Omerica Organic...Did you customize or actually make them out of wood? Just curious! If you made them they're really gorgeous high quality work and I'm impressed.  




 Your hair looks like cotton candy miss! And I like it! :) 




 Good places to eat/sight see around the Monaco hotel downtown? I'm not 21 and I'm a tourist...Help please! I'm pretty sad I can't drink or 'anything ;)' while I'm here... 




 This ^,  and if you like double flares and not the hassle of getting them in I'd recommend trying different materials like silicone and getting df plugs in any other material that have less of a flare... Some can certainly have even more than a mm flare and even that much at 2g would be near impossible... For anyone with tight skin. 




 Not electronic but Neko Case! 









 Toilet paper, wood, cigarettes, prescription medications, money, credit cards...The list goes on and it is debatable which would cause more uproar. 




 Que the riot scene about this very thing from Wentworth, am I right? I guess this comment is more for people who watch the show but yeah...This scenario in a prison setting. 




 Well, when a female porn star has her period yeah. She would want to stay home and watch Ellen(or Netflix) with chocolate...They're people too. Porn would get tiring.  




 That we all say eh, know everyone else in our country, and live in igloos...Don't even need to guess do you?

Because they're all super untrue and they annoy me... 




 I have some pretty good ones: side/rib tattoo for 4.5 hours, laparoscopy surgery, and living with endo for years.

I know its cliche 




 What I like:

* My long eyelashes
* My slightly ginger hair
* Tattoos

* My bum
* My boobs
* In love with my micro dermals, in the tragus area

What I don't like:

* Teeth, front two are crooked
* Brows, on the thin side and light because part ginger
* Height and weight, 5'1 and 137 lbs
* Stretch marks
* Scars
* I have a really short tongue, I can barely stick it out
* Skin - pale and eczema
* Fine bone straight hair - I want dreads so...... 




 I think if you added a few more stars to the bottom it would make it more American but I'm a Canadian so what do I know :P 




 Wow, this is a whole other level of stupidity all of its own. I can't even believe someone could be that dumb and ignorant over 5 damn cents!  









 This is really different than anything else LOG I've ever heard especially at the beginning but I still really enjoy it!  




 Even using a leave in spray conditioner should solve this issue as well as brushing more regularly...Also, any shampoo with lots of chemicals(so drugstore or even professional stuff) makes my hair smoother, straighter, and even thinner so I'd say that and leave in...


Also maybe consider how much you're washing your hair and adjust if its less than every day or every other day! 
























 Now, I'm really interested to know how many taco bell restaurants he is worth.  




 This is awesome! I love hourglass pieces and this one is really unique! 




 Dating sites, bars, activities...Friends are overrated!! 




 Being blind without a doubt, I can't even handle closing my eyes around other people... 




 I'm in love with this.  




 You're welcome! :) 




 They're actually glass with a 'cracked' pattern in them! I got them from arctic buffalo: http://arcticbuffalo.com/collections/plugs/products/purple-cracked-glass-plugs










Also in pink: http://arcticbuffalo.com/collections/plugs/products/light-rose-cracked-glass-plugs 




 That's awesome! Most people really want realistic photograph quality stuff and I actually find the tattoos that aren't to be more interesting! 


Okay, good! :)  




 The quality of line in this isn't on par as far as crisp and clean goes...did you want it in that 2D hand drawn style? If not I would consider going else where. 


Not trying to sound snarky at all by the way, I apologize in advance. 




 Feel like I should take a drink every time this has lice listed as another item on the list. :P 


Seriously though this sucks,  









 I meant combination as in using crochet for maintenance! I need them to be very neat(as neat as dreads can be) because I work in a business casual setting on a daily basis.  




 Please refer to title, and I have fine relatively straight  shoulder length hair BUT I already use dollylocks bar shampoo and sea salt spray! :)  




 You should really ask the artist you want to tattoo you...Look at their work, if you like their portfolio book a consult. Tell them exactly what you want in as much detail as you can with a defined budget. Then, they should show you this design before your appointment. 


Also, if you do this just as a tip taking the design someone draws for you and getting it tattooed elsewhere is a no no. And give them as much warning as possible if you need to cancel... 




 This really is porn, holy shit. I would sell my soul for an apartment this nice.  




 I just pull my bottom eyelid enough to get it slightly open and dive bomb a bunch in. it works because the bottom lid will catch all the visine! Be prepared to spaz after though, that shit stings! 




 Dammit Dynamite, this is totally me...How do you know this, are you the one watching me?  




 I use bedhead, dirty secret dry shampoo and it works perfectly...I tried tresemme, dove, and other brands before this! Only one I would even dream of recommending. Dove also stained my brown hair white. 


Also, make sure you're holding it far enough away from your hair and that you're spraying it through the layers if its longer...
 




 This poor fucker, what did they eat... the table? I can't imagine dealing with that many food allergies daily. 




 Makes me want to get real cuticles tattoos, so nice! Good job OP, on the nails as well.
