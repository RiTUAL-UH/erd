 "OP shares accurate information in the hopes that people will be persuaded by what they see."

"...okay?"

"And they're vegan."

"Everyone grab your pitchforks!" 




 People who use nature to justify their actions end up with a society that is red in tooth and claw. 




 When the options are kill fewer animals or kill more animals vegans choose to kill fewer animals. (And of course we should still do everything possible and practical to make the fewer number as low as possible). 

 




 Even if all 96 million cats died from a vegan diet, how many fewer animals would be slaughtered to become cat food if all cats were fed a vegan diet? You cannot choose the most ethical option for feeding your cat without considering all of the consequences of your choice. 




 [Here is a link to the source video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIpCNiq0ibE) 




 Just because I have chosen to provide some care for an animal doesn't mean I can cause any amount of harm to other animals to benefit the animal I have chosen to care for. An animal that is distant, who I won't see suffering, or who has less connection to me or someone I know is no less deserving of ethical consideration than the one that is right in front of me. An ethical person would weigh their interests similarly. 




 Thanks for citing the appropriate wikipedia article. I am doing all of this from my cell phone, so it is a bit tough to look things up. I have read the study you cited previously. I think you have failed to emphasize that none of the vegan cats were deficient in taurine, as well as to provide a reference for the proportion of cats on conventional food with low taurine levels. That said, the study does show that vegan cat owners could better protect their cats' health by choosing a vegan cat food with higher taurine.

I'm also not arguing that the cats will be the ones better off if they eat a vegan diet. Even if all 96 million cats died from a vegan diet, how many fewer animals would be slaughtered to become cat food if all cats were fed a vegan diet? You cannot choose the most ethical option for feeding your cat without considering all of the consequences of your choice. 




 I am saying it is better to choose the option that causes less harm to animals than the option that causes more harm. This is probably one of the  least controversial ethical statements anyone could make. 

It sounds like you are trying to describe a situation where more harm would be caused by letting the dog suffer and die than is caused to a snake to produce a single dose of antivenom. If that is the case I would say the less harmful option is the better one. If it were not the case I would still say the less harmful option is better. 

I am not saying that every scenario is clear cut or that I always know which option is less harmful. However, I have yet to see anyone even attempt to make the case that the animals being raised and slaughtered for cat food are harmed less than a cat would be even if it was fed the worst possible diet. 




 [Here is the source for the 85% claim in the title](http://www.theghostsinourmachine.com/downloads/TheGhostsInOurMachine-ImpactReport.pdf) 




 I'm always hearing about how Americans are becoming increasingly overweight due to their diets being too high in fruits and vegetables.  

/sarcasm 




 Also, why the hell would you claim that vegan diets kill cats 100% of the time due to zero taurine when you knew about a study on the amount of taurine in vegan cat food? 




 Are you saying that taurine levels in all cat foods are too low or do you think that vegan cat foods have less taurine than non-vegan cat foods? Could you link to one of these studies? 




 All vegan cat foods and most non-vegan cat foods are fortified with taurine. [Read about it on Wikipedia](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taurine).

We have the nutritional knowledge and mastery of chemistry necessary to overcome that challenge. 




 If it was the case that feeding a cat a vegan diet would cause it to suffer and die 100% of the time, that would still be more ethical than causing 10 other animals to suffer and die. What cats naturally do is irrelevant. The fact that the cat is right in front of you while the other animals will be out of sight is irrelevant. It is still more ethical to choose the option that causes less harm. 




  I'm just concerned with 9 animals lives.

Why aren't you more concerned for the lives of the animals that are killed to become non-vegan cat food? Far more than 9 animals would die to feed 9 cats a non-vegan diet for their entire lives. Shouldn't killing more animals be seen as worse than something that kills fewer animals (if any)? 




 I search YouTube for videos that portray farmed animals in a positive light, or sometimes I stumble across them on Facebook (Mercy For Animals posts a lot of good material), then I use imgur's [video to gif](http://imgur.com/vidgif) tool to turn them into gifs. 




 Subscribe to /r/vegan. People post enough pictures of awesome vegan foods that you will want to try yourself that you will find yourself with very few non-veg meals left.

 I like to think that there is a bit more to my existence than just the cute animal gifs that I share on reddit, but I'll consider my life 80% validated now. 




 Your boyfriend wouldn't just be like, "I'm sure there's a good reason for why you need a picture with a bag of frozen vegetables on your face. I'm happy to take it for you, dear"? 




 I like this answer much better than the actual answer, so I'm sticking with this one. 




 The Life You Can Save, and the other effective altruism work of yours that I have seen, seem to focus predominately on mitigating terrible cases of human suffering, which is undoubtedly an important cause. However, it seems quite likely that each of us can do much more with the same amount of resources to mitigate animal suffering. A good deal of your other work has addressed the issue of speciesism and the importance of animal rights in living an ethical life, but the work on effective altruism within the animal rights movement (for example the work done by [Animal Charity Evaluators](http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/recommendations/top-charities/)) seems to be more of an afterthought. Why have you chosen to focus much more specifically on humans in your recent work? 




 The way you worded it doesn't really describe his position, but let me Google the answer for you:

Q. You have been quoted as saying: "Killing a defective infant is not morally equivalent to killing a person. Sometimes it is not wrong at all." Is that quote accurate? 

A. It is accurate, but can be misleading if read without an understanding of what I mean by the term person (which is discussed in Practical Ethics, from which that quotation is taken). I use the term "person" to refer to a being who is capable of anticipating the future, of having wants and desires for the future.  As I have said in answer to the previous question, I think that it is generally a greater wrong to kill such a being than it is to kill a being that has no sense of existing over time. Newborn human babies have no sense of their own existence over time. So killing a newborn baby is never equivalent to killing a person, that is, a being who wants to go on living.  That doesnt mean that it is not almost always a terrible thing to do.  It is, but that is because most infants are loved and cherished by their parents, and to kill an infant is usually to do a great wrong to its parents. 
Sometimes, perhaps because the baby has a serious disability, parents think it better that their newborn infant should die. Many doctors will accept their wishes, to the extent of not giving the baby life-supporting medical treatment.  That will often ensure that the baby dies.  My view is different from this, only to the extent that if a decision is taken, by the parents and doctors, that it is better that a baby should die, I believe it should be possible to carry out that decision, not only by withholding or withdrawing life-support  which can lead to the baby dying slowly from dehydration or from an infection - but also by taking active steps to end the babys life swiftly and humanely.

 Of course the legislature should only pass laws if there is a good reason for them. That isn't what this amendment is going to ensure. It will instead provide a basis for large agricultural interests to legally challenge laws they don't like in court. You wouldn't only need to convince a majority of legislators and the governor to pass a law, you also need to prove it to a judge, and if he or she sides with you then another judge on appeal. At the same time laws that favor big ag without good public reason will go unchallenged, and those that only hurt smaller farms that cannot afford the legal costs will go unchallenged too. This is an amendment designed to enshrine big business interests in the state's constitution. 




 You should cut them on the bias. 




 I wasn't trying to suggest that those things were goals of people who have sex with animals. 




 Being natural is completely irrelevant. If humans had been having sex with animals for hundreds of thousands of years and it was more convenient for you to find an animal to have sex with than another human would it be okay then?

Meat isn't easy either. It takes time to cook, it comes with high risk of foodborne illness, most of the world considers it to be a luxury. [Soylent](http://www.soylent.me/) is a vegan option that is incredibly convenient (just add water). You can get nuts at any store, they keep well for long periods of time, and you can eat them right out of the container by the handful. Rice and beans are staples of the world's poor. There is no reason to eat meat other than the fact that you enjoy it despite the terrible harm caused to animals, which is the exact reasoning behind why people engage in the cruelty of having non-consensual sex with animals.

You do not need to eat meat to get enough protein. And just because something happens in nature does not make it ethical.

I also run a small subreddit /r/SummerScavengerHunt. We run a photo/video scavenger hunt on subreddit that will be starting on June 1 of this year. It is a lot of fun, and I encourage everyone to join!

Here are a few of the items people submitted for last year's scavenger hunt:

 PETA is certainly a group with significant shortcomings, but lets not forget that this campaign against PETA is driven by an industry lobbyist group, the [Center for Consumer Freedom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Consumer_Freedom), with the goal of conflating PETA with animal rights and setting the entire cause back.

Whenever you see these stories, please consider making a donation to a group doing actual work to help animals. [Here are charities that Animal Charity Evaluators has recommended as the most effective for helping animals](http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/recommendations/). PETA does not deserve your money, but animals should not be left to suffer because industry funded interests want to shut their opponents up entirely. 




 I ate a vegetable once, and I almost puked. I don't know how vegans can compare these things to real food. 




  Nothing - absolutely nothing - in that paragraph describes you as a vegan. Nor do you admit that you do in fact have issues with the consumption of all animal products, which to me would be a much more intellectually honest conversation.

When someone mentions that they're vegan reddit's response is, "how do you know someone is vegan? Don't worry they'll tell you." When someone doesn't mention that they're vegan you then try to call them out for not mentioning it.

It seems to me like some people just want to find a reason to get upset with vegans for simply existing.

 The chickens that are in the world today are going to be slaughtered for food, but fewer will be bred to replace them as the demand drops. Huge global demand changes don't happen overnight. 




 Yes, I am a chicken. Just trying to share some info about my awesome brothers and sisters. 




 10 billion is the number of birds and mammals killed in the United States for food every year. 

Roughly 60 billion is the number of birds and mammals killed worldwide for food every year.

Depending upon which marine animals you count, 110 billion could be a total for the number of individuals killed annually for food, but you can also find much higher numbers that count a broader range of marine animals. 




 The article is saying that donating money has a bigger impact than personally avoiding meat. Nobody is saying that then makes it okay to eat meat (except under the hypothetical scenario where eating some meat could lead one to save enough money that could then save the lives of far more animals.) 




 You're citing examples where the person is still doing more harm than good. A more appropriate example might be Batman committing a minor crime to stop the Joker from killing thousands of Gotham residents. Most of us would say the small negative that Batman is committing is justified given the much larger positive. 




 You could send them [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxRIh9R2YfY) as a response. 




 I'll post the gif to /r/gifs and /r/aww. I still need to look into the best subreddit for the ag-gag post. The best way to find them would just be to go to my post history though.  




 I think you did the right thing by including PETA's contributions to this post on /r/vegan, but when it comes to other subreddits I suspect that mentioning PETA's role will make your comment less effective toward the goal of helping animals. Ultimately what is best for the animals should prevail over giving credit where credit is due. 




 I have two posts about NC planned for tomorrow. I'm going to turn the cute opossum eating a grape video into a gif, and I also have a post planned about NC's new ag-gag proposal.

I'll schedule the posts to go up between 8-10AM North Carolina time. I will be fast asleep at this time, but if any of you North Carolinians (or anyone else) are on reddit, make a comment about the animal cruelty exemption for opossums in the comments of the gif post (I would recommend leaving out the bits about PETA's involvement though given how much reddit hates PETA). 




 [Here are the groups recommended by Animal Charity Evaluators for having the biggest impact per dollar donated](http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/recommendations/top-charities/) 




 It is good that you are reflecting on your mistakes. Every time I have screwed up when discussing veganism/animal rights has been a lesson for how not to discuss it in the future.  




 This article is from March 2014. It seems like some op-ed from a year ago had it right, but now they are ignoring the issue. 




 I'm sure they do sell it in my area; I just haven't looked yet. I don't make many trips to Whole Foods since I already have an excellent vegan selection at the supermarkets that are even closer to me (not to mention much cheaper). 




 The effectiveness in terms of numbers of lives saved per dollar by the top charities on Animal Charity Evaluators are about 10,000 times those of the top charities working for human causes.

Do humans experience 10,000 times as much joy as non-human animals? Do we suffer 10,000 times as intensely? Are our interests 10,000 times stronger? It is admittedly hard to estimate such things, but I don't think any reasonable estimate would be anywhere near 10,000 times.

For that reason I focus 100% of my giving to the charities recommended by Animal Charity Evaluators. 




 I have the same question that the sharks posed at the end. I can find a lot of fancy artisan vegan cheeses in my area, but how well does it compete with the cost of normal supermarket cheese? 




 Lol, you got me cracking up about [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxRIh9R2YfY) all over again. 




 Animals are individuals though.A species might gain a large boost in numbers if humans began factory farming them and consuming them as food, but cows, pigs, and chickens suffer in many of the same ways you would if you were thrust into similar conditions. They deserve respect as individuals, not merely consideration for what propagates a species. 




 I agree with /u/tbhx12345 that OKCupid is better. The choices are still slim, but at least I don't have to look through all 4,000 omnis in my area to find the 40 or so vegan profiles.

 This is like saying, "I'm not a quadrilateral; I'm a trapezoid." Human describes your species, but you are also a member of kingdom animalia. 




 I wonder how many people have tried to message me, but sent a message to the wrong person. 




 Unlike some US states with ag-gag laws where you will get sued and/or thrown in jail for documenting animal abuse at a slaughterhouse. 




 The first letter is actually a lower case L. 




 What is an animal rights group that you think more people should donate to? 




 Just imagine how boring /u/The_Withheld_Name and /u/runnerdood's jobs must be! :P 




 I'm glad other people are looking at those. I was the one who asked the subreddit reports guy to start running the report for /r/vegan. 




 On a more serious note though, chickens are much more than just products. They are individuals who recognize one another and remember past actions. They experience joy from activities such as dust bathing or caring for their young, and suffer when confined on farms or slaughtered. These things have powerful implications about how we ought to treat them. 




 See this is the problem. How are we supposed to improve conditions for chickens when Canadians can't even read an article about the treatment of cocks without thinking about beating their meat? 




 Is /u/kittiesnewyears trying to break my monopoly on pig gif posts? 




 [Mercy for Animals](http://www.mercyforanimals.org/) and [Compassion Over Killing](http://cok.net/) are two excellent groups that conduct undercover investigations like the one shown. Donations to these groups help to publicly expose the terrible cruelty happening inside farms, which does make a big difference in getting the laws needed to protect animals passed. 




 The owner is also an awesome animal rights activist. Definitely a business that I am happy supporting. 




 I monitor usage of the word "PETA" on reddit, and I keep hearing people mention "Peta Jensen". Is that vegan enough? 




 Check out /r/veganrecipes or /r/veganfoodporn if you would like to see examples of how delicious a meat-free diet can be! 




 I should start keeping a tally of how many of my posts find their way back to /r/vegan. 




  I don't want to have my real name associated with everything I do online though.

I remember you giving out your name in the comments of something I posted on /r/vegan about a week ago. 




 I think /u/sap91 just wants people to look at his penis. 




 Your body is only making vitamin D from a very narrow band of UV wavelengths. These same wavelengths also cause sunburn and DNA damage that lead to skin cancer. If you are getting vitamin D from the sun you are also putting yourself at higher risk of skin cancer. Getting dietary vitamin D and protecting yourself from the sun is a much safer option. 




 Sun is better for developing skin cancer. 




 Unfortunately, products marketed as free range are not the idyllic conditions that people picture them to be. [Here is a picture of a "free range" egg laying facility](http://i.imgur.com/8Tv6y7O.jpg). 




 I found your OKC profile. 95% match, not bad. 




 Unfortunately, chickens are not just egg laying machines, and many municipalities have begun having problems with people who buy chickens thinking they are getting a lifetime supply of eggs, but a couple years down the road when the chickens start laying far fewer eggs, these people won't slaughter the chickens, so they just end up getting abandoned. No commercial farm is keeping spent hens for life either, but they inevitably end up getting sent to slaughter. At the same time, if you are buying chickens from a hatchery you are inevitably supporting the killing of many male chicks who are of no use for egg laying purposes. 

If keeping chickens is something you are able to do, look into adopting spent hens as there is a serious need for people to rescue these animals. They are loving companions who deserve and will appreciate your affection, but don't expect to be getting a large number of free eggs out of it. 




 The Certified Humane label means very little. It prohibits battery cages, but all three of the facilities pictured would likely meet certified humane standards. 

Another one of the Humane labelling standards, American Humane Certified, even allows battery cages to still be used as long as they are "enriched colony cages". 




 The cage free picture is from [this Sierra Club article](http://www.sierraclub.org/chicago/sierra/2015-2-march-april/feature/local-roots-vs-industrial-agriculture#8) (for everyone who thinks the EU is better, the picture is from a Belgian farm).

The Free Range picture is from [the Wikipedia article on free range eggs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-range_eggs)

The organic picture is from [this CBS news article](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/trouble-in-the-henhouse-the-scam-of-organic-eggs/) 




 You woke me up for this? You are stating that people put their own preferences ahead of behaving ethically. This isn't news. It also doesn't change the answers to how we ought to behave. 




 I heard two PETA workers were once caught going house to house, killing people's plants and tossing their bodies into a dumpster. People ask them to help thinking that they are good gardeners, but can you believe that PETA kills 96% of the plants they garden?! 




 Are you planning on swallowing it? I remember /u/Zhaey pointed out that there is a lot of debate over whether vegans are allowed to swallow. 




 You aren't really vegancirclejerking if you don't do it for ethical reasons. There is no health reason to circlejerk about leather and wool or to cut your food on the bias. 




 Way to fairly portray his position. I'm sure he wrote, "we should kill babies because they are disabled. No more to that one, that's enough philosophy for today!" 




 That's true, direct action is much broader than just illegal actions, and there certainly are instances where taking actions to directly help animals is the right thing to do. 




 I take action and [I have evidence that my techniques work](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/2xk3fk/february_was_an_effective_month_of_activism_for/). 




 Hostage taking? We don't want a feral child incident. (This is a reference to the movie [Bold Native](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JToC6l9Xx_c). For those who haven't seen it the film depicts an ALF cell that plans a nationwide string of actions to free animals. At one point in the film the protagonist meets up with an old friend who he had lost touch with, and finds out she had been keeping a factory farmer in her basement, treating him like he treated his animals, and calling him the "Feral Child" while posting videos of it online.)

While I highly recommend the movie Bold Native, I don't think direct action is an effective strategy for achieving the goals we want. In the film the protagonist, Charlie, says, "people will ask themselves 'why are people willing to risk so much to save animals?'" when describing the outcome he hoped to see from his actions. What we really see when these actions take place is people acting like we are the terrorists and simply giving the justification that animal rights activists are crazy as the reason why we fight so hard for the cause.

We need to make the case to people that animal rights matter so that they choose to respect animal rights on their own. Making threats or taking actions against people is not the way to accomplish this. Outreach like what /u/VeganMinecraft is doing, or what groups like Mercy for Animals, Vegan Outreach, and the Humane League regularly participate in is the most effective way to achieve this. 




 According to [this post from /r/dataisbeautiful](http://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/2fd1gf/protein_sources_by_calories_value_and_portion/) the two cheapest sources of protein by a substantial margin are both vegan. 




 Cows are individuals, not a species. The individuals do not benefit by being farmed any more than you would be better off if super intelligent aliens packed you in a tiny cell, fattened you up, harvested a bit of your DNA to breed more humans, and slaughtered you. 




 If a person existed where the "good" (increase in happiness) that came from them eating a burger exceeded the "bad" (cow suffering and death) then it would be an ethical decision for them to continue eating burgers. Such people don't actually exist, but if they did then the conclusion follows. 

I'm not sure how you see that as a flaw with utilitarianism. 




  favorite words: foods, moral

Jeez, this guy sounds like some sort of preachy vegan... 




 It is edible, but I much prefer Just Mayo and Veganaise. 




 [Mercy for Animals](http://www.mercyforanimals.org/) is an excellent group that has some international presence; although their work is mainly in North America. If you are looking for a truly international group then I think the best option is [Animal Equality International](http://www.animalequality.net/). 




 I do also have Google alerts set up to publish to an RSS feed, which is where I find maybe 30% of my content. 




 There is no one simple way. This particular post I came across because I was trying to track down some other research I had seen previously to respond to someone's comment and I just happened to look into what new research was coming up. 




 [The data from the Physicians Health Study I and Women's Health Study shows that increased egg consumption correlates with higher risk of diabetes.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2628696/)

CONCLUSIONSThese data suggest that high levels of egg consumption (daily) are associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes in men and women. 




 Those statements are true, but entirely irrelevant when it comes to the answering the question of whether or not consumer choices can influence supply. 




 There are countless examples where demand has declined as consumer preferences have shifted. Nowhere near as many VCRs are being produced today as were produced two decades ago. 

Obviously one consumer or just the United States isn't going to eliminate all global demand for animal products, but if all Americans gave up meat it would make a world of difference for roughly 10 billion mammals and birds per year that Americans would have otherwise consumed. 




 Obviously the animal that has already been slaughtered and whose flesh is being sold at the store will not be the animal who is saved. However, as demand declines, fewer animals will be bred and raised in captivity to meet the lower demand. The animals who are not being born into these atrocious factory farm conditions down the road are the ones being saved by your choice to abstain from meat.

 I was a bit disappointed when I saw what /r/todayilearned was doing for April 1st (I had set my computer up the evening before to make the post while I slept), but I still think things turned out very well overall. Most people seeing the post are just browsing the front page and have no idea what the subreddit is doing today. 




 Wow, thanks. How did nobody catch that sooner?

Link is fixed now. 




 Why are you shouting? 




 He isn't saying to do it because it is good for your body (although most people would benefit from eating less meat). The video makes the case that we should cut these products out because of the way other animals are being treated. 




  270lbs per person per year. That's half your body weight!

Lol 




 Let me introduce you to [Bob Comis](http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/4518133) a pig farmer who ran an idyllic farm under the best of conditions, but who acknowledged that there are still many forms of cruelty inherent to the system of raising animals for food. 




 [This article (from before the veto) does a better job of discussing the major issues](http://www.onegreenplanet.org/news/arizona-passes-a-bill-that-states-livestock-are-not-animals/). In short, the legislation said that livestock would no longer be considered animals as far as Arizona animal welfare laws were concerned, and it would have removed all protections that they had.  




 There was only one other woman eating by herself.

And now that lonely woman is going to be seen by thousands of people sitting alone in that restaurant. 




 [Insects are animals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect)

Kingdom |	Animalia
---|---
Phylum |	Arthropoda
Clade |	Pancrustacea
Subphylum |	Hexapoda
(unranked) |	Ectognatha
Class |	Insecta

However, there is also the aspect of whether they are animals that can meaningfully be exploited or harmed, as there are some animals such as sponges, that lack nervous systems and therefore there is little reason to suspect they can suffer. Insects do possess nervous systems, and most vegans feel there is sufficient reason to suspect insects can suffer to warrant not consuming them. 




 The taste is not bad. If I had to compare it to something I would say pancake batter, but it is more pleasant than drinking pancake batter.

 You do realize that in order to produce meat you need to feed animals more energy (calories) than you get back out when they are slaughtered, right? We are using huge amounts of arable land currently to feed livestock that could be used to feed more people if it was used to grow food intended directly for human consumption. 




 I think /u/unlimitednights is saying that it is not enough just to treat someone well, that still wouldn't make it okay to kill them. 




 People who don't pay attention to what they eat in general tend to end up unhealthy. There is nothing exceptionally complex about planning an appropriate vegan diet. 




 Cattle aren't going to go extinct if humans stop farming them. There are [wild cattle in the Aleutian Islands](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleutian_wild_cattle) that humans have been trying to round up unsuccessfully for decades. 

Other than that your comment is spot on.

 It varies quite a bit from one veg fest to another. The worst event I have ever been to for pseudoscience nonsense was actually a green festival (I ran the Action For Animals table at the San Francisco and Los Angeles Green Festivals a couple years back). There were magnetic bracelets and "energy" jewelry galore. It was a really disappointing glimpse at the environmental movement that made you realize why some people would question the accuracy of the environmental claims these people were making.

They also printed our name badges on paper made from elephant poop. I feel like they should at least give a heads up before someone hangs some elephant feces around their neck.

 Isn't this something that most of us already are doing? 




 Take a look at [ChooseVeg.com](http://www.chooseveg.com/). It is the best resource I have found for answering questions about how to make the switch to a vegan lifestyle.

The simple answer though is to just do it! Everyone I have ever spoken to about going vegan has said that it was easier than they had imagined beforehand and that once they committed to doing it they didn't regret it for a moment. 




 How would you have written it better? 




 Dawkins has also said that he would like everyone to go vegetarian and that the future may look back on our present treatment of other animals the way we look back on our ancestors owning slaves.

 There still are chickens that roam freely in many places. Kauai has chickens that can be found all over the island. 

They are also much more intelligent than people give them credit for. Chickens can be taught to sit and come or even to complete an obstacle course. They form a social hierarchy called a pecking order and they will perform favors for other individuals showing that they clearly recognise one another and remember past actions.

 Don't patronize us as if we don't have any idea of what happens in the dairy industry. I have been to idyllic dairy farms. I have helped in the process of making cheese with milk from cows that I milked myself. I follow the posts of the [National Dairy Council](http://www.nationaldairycouncil.org/Pages/Home.aspx) and read articles from just about every dairy industry magazine that publishes their material online. Not only do we follow the dairy industry's own publications, but there are vegans who [are former large scale dairy farmers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Lyman).  

I don't just watch undercover investigations posted by animal rights groups. I watch [videos from dairy farmers of their own operations, like this video of farmers "reuniting" their cows with their calves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vSIlTNED-Q). I no longer just see a few happy cows though. I see several panicked mothers who are seeing their children again as well as many more who are still frantically searching for their lost sons. Mothers who may never fully recover from the trauma of losing their children. I read [this comment](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2zwd7f/what_goes_on_in_the_mind_of_a_cow/cpn3ixe) recently from someone else who, like yourself, grew up on a dairy farm, and described the efforts the mothers go through to protect their children. I see the hopeless sons crying for their mothers, but who will most likely face a short life before being slaughtered for veal. I see the slaughter the cows themselves will inevitably face as they age.

We don't make the decision to change our lifestyles lightly, but only after thoroughly researching and understanding both sides of the issue. When you have put half the effort into understanding our position that we have put into understanding yours, then we will be happy to welcome you for an AMA. 




 I'm not surprised. They are well connected to a lot of other vegans. 




 Several more states have passed ag-gag laws.  




 I often hear people dismiss the footage shown in undercover investigations as being simply isolated incidents. They claim the actions are the work of a handful of bad employees and not representative of the industry as a whole. Based on your experience, how prevalent would you say the mistreatment of animals is within the meat industry? 




 Supplements or fortified foods can be appropriate sources for B12 as a vegan, and you probably eat fortified foods all the time. You have iodized salt, breakfast cereal, and enriched flour. We are far better off than we would otherwise be because we consume fortified foods. 




 [Link for those who are interested](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce4DJh-L7Ys) 




 Congrats on your poops bro. 




 Very few people are vegan because they object to the taste/texture of meat. On the contrary most of us enjoyed meat, but found that we couldn't justify consuming it because of the harm caused to animals, the environment, or personal health. Having things that taste like meat without these negative consequences are a win-win! 




 I don't have any urgent desire to post audio or video; although I might consider using it if there were more people on the site. It just throws me off to have the links that don't do anything. 

Also, what is the point of private photos. Why would people upload a photo at all if nobody can see it? 




 I went through the trouble of setting up a profile, so I expect you guys to join and message me! 




 When I'm writing my profile can I do any formatting? Am I able to use asterisks, HTML, or CSS to **bold** text? Is there any way to add hyperlinks to my profile?

EDIT:

I also see that there are tabs for pictures, audio, and video on each profile, but I can't find anywhere to upload audio or video, nor does it seem to be possible to have more than one picture uploaded. 




 You get the best view of the underside of *his* belly between 2:21 and 2:25 into the video. There are no udders visible there. 




 Well when it does we will make sure to keep in mind that /u/NOBODYFUCKSWIFJESUS was the one that started it. 




 I very nearly decided to use "cow" in the title. I knew it wasn't correct, but I didn't care about conveying the gender of the individual featured in the video, and unfortunately there is no accepted singular form of the word "cattle". It really doesn't matter if the video is about a castrated or uncastrated (insert singular of cattle here) either. 




 Your post got downvoted by many other people than just vegans, but I wouldn't blame vegans for downvoting it too, as most people don't like baseless accusations directed at them. Try going to a thread discussing the keystone XL pipeline and accusing /r/environment of vote brigading without good evidence to back it up. You will get downvoted by members of /r/environment and nonmembers whose opinions you just dismissed as nothing more than part of a vote brigade! That is exactly how you came off in the comment you linked to, which was directed at someone that wasn't vegan. 




 I believe it is a health hazard, and also would probably have a very unpleasant taste as we have evolved to avoid animals who have died under such circumstances for food safety reasons. We similarly have an aversion to the sight and particularly smell of sick, dying, or dead animals. 




 I have been watching this thread closely too. There isn't some huge vegan force taking vegans to the top and downvoting meat based comments. There are plenty of comments with views on both sides that have been upvoted and downvoted, and while I'm sure there are plenty of redditors with some bias, for the most part the comments that have succeeded have been due to their merits and speaking to a wide audience. The views I have seen expressed in this thread seem to fall within the normal spectrum of views expressed on animal rights across reddit.

I know that /r/vegan made that stickied post in large part because there are inevitably a handful people like yourself who accuse vegans and specifically /r/vegan of vote brigading whenever comments supporting animal rights get upvoted. If you read the top comment from that /r/vegan post it is about how vegans need to hold themselves to a higher standard than the rest of the community in order to be accepted. /r/vegan wanted to make abundantly clear that it did not support any such actions and protect itself from potential backlash from the community or site admins. I know a lot of the members from /r/vegan and none of them support vote brigading, nor have I seen any pattern of problem vote brigading from /r/vegan in the past (any more than any other subreddit). 




 No, of course I don't mind people looking at my post history. I wouldn't post things if I didn't want people to see them. I hope you have a similarly enjoyable veganniversary! 




 That's a bit of an unfair assessment of my submissions. I submit [robots dancing](http://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/2zpply/robot_dance_party/) and [pictures I have taken at the beach](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/2z8bin/i_did_some_digging_at_the_beach_this_weekend_the/). I submit [recipes](http://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/2v6xuq/pasta_with_snap_peas_garlic_lemon_zest_and_black/) and [quotes](http://www.reddit.com/r/quotes/comments/2zl7to/it_is_difficult_to_get_a_man_to_understand/). I also run a Scavenger Hunt every summer at /r/summerscavengerhunt (everyone should join, it is a lot of fun).

I am glad that many people who see the gifs of pigs and other animals that I submit are led to reconsider the ways in which they treat other animals as a result of seeing the gif; however, anyone who thinks it is possible to submit content and count solely on the voting power of vegans to buoy it is delusional. /u/macaroni_monster's comment has about 200 karma because it spoke to vegans and non-vegans alike. My submission is approaching 4500 karma because it is a submission that everyone appreciates (well, 96% of people according to the current votes). People who act crass and careless to the treatment of other animals are downvoted because they are out of touch with the way the majority of people feel about how we ought to treat other animals. 




  I have nothing in common with pigs.

You have plenty of things in common with pigs. You share 4 billion years of ancestors, you have a similar brain structure, digestive structure, circulatory system, etc. That said, why does an individual need to be similar to you in order to be deserving of ethical consideration? If there were aliens who were fully aware, possessed strong emotions and interests, and suffered when mistreated, would it be okay to mistreat them simply because they were not similar to you? 




 Even by the intelligence metric there are plenty of other animals that are smarter than many humans (for example young children, the severely mentally handicapped, or senile elderly individuals). We rightly insist that these humans still get treated far better than we currently treat other animals. Why don't we insist upon at least a similar level of treatment for non-human animals? 




 I'm a vegan teetotaler for non-religious reasons too! 




 True, but they have been pretty substantially diluted by that point. 




 Working to earn a large salary so that we can donate a substantial portion of it is an arguably more effective thing each of us can be doing. [Here is a piece by Animal Charity Evaluators that discusses this strategy](http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/resources/career-advice/). 




 We must take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented. Sometimes we must interfere.

-Elie Wiesel 




 There's more to determining what we ought to do than simply pointing to things that we enjoy or things that are convenient. You have to take into account the impact your actions have on others as well. 




 I believe news stories when the things they are saying matches what can be found in the original research the news stories are based off of. I'm entirely willing to change my views on the subject if there was good evidence to justify changing my views.  




 If plants did have feelings, far fewer plants would need to be killed if we ate them directly than if we fed plants to animals then subsequently ate those animals, so choosing a plant-based diet would still be a more ethical option. Although, I would argue that choosing a diet particularly heavy in fruit would then be the most ethical choice as plants have evolved to make fruits with the goal of having them be eaten to help spread their seeds. 

However, there is also good reason for us to believe that plants do not feel emotions in any meaningful sense. We know that in ourselves and other animals our experience of emotions exists in the reactions taking place in our nervous system. As plants do not possess nervous systems (and even some animals such as sponges) there is no reason to suspect such capabilities would extend to organisms lacking those systems. 

I have of course read plenty of sensational news stories about how "science proves that plants feel pain." However, all of these stories seem to be based off of much more reasonable research on how plants react to stimuli. A rock will similarly react to the stimuli of being kicked, and a light bulb will react to the stimuli of an electric current, but that does not mean they feel emotions.  




 As much as people hate to be confronted with criticism of their actions, there are some relevant comparisons to be made. Before people flip the fuck out about "how dare you compare killing animals to the Holocaust or slavery" [read this comic](http://imgur.com/a/BqPzT). I am not saying that they are the same in every regard, nor that they are equally unjust or even that you necessarily have to accept that the comparison tells us anything useful about how we ought to feel about them. I'm saying that in respect to the massive number of deaths or the treatment of individuals as property there is a relevant similarity that can under some circumstances be helpful for understanding both sets of issues. 

While non-human animals may not be deserving of all the ethical consideration of the typical adult human, many of the animals we eat, particularly pigs, are quite intelligent (in many regards more intelligent than young human children). There are many humans (for example the severely mentally handicapped) who will never progress past the intellectual capabilities of a young child, and there is no reason to suspect that they have any more capacity to experience joy or suffering any more intensely than a pig. Nonetheless, we all recognize that it would be a grave injustice to treat these people as we presently treat pigs or other farmed animals. Why should we be any less upset about the terrible treatment of pigs than we would rightly be about similar treatment of severely mentally handicapped individuals? 




 That's why I added the qualifier "significant amounts of" to my statement. The dairy industry breeds cows to have a calf every year to maximize the total yield, but I understand that cows would still produce some milk for quite some time after having their first calf as long as they continue to be pumped. 




  Eating meat is natural and doesn't kill the consumer.

OP isn't worried about smokers killing themselves; they are worried about them causing harm to other individuals. Eating meat certainly harms other animals, and it causes a lot more harm than second hand smoke. 




 In the last 100 years we have started doing many things that differ from how humans have evolved. Even in terms of food you are purchasing fruits, vegetables, and countless other varieties of foods that didn't exist a century ago. You are typing away on technology that didn't exist and people are extending their lives with medical treatments that didn't exist. In terms of ethics we are treating women, gays, people of other races, and the disabled differently from how our ancestors would have. Why would you continue to cling to the circumstances under which humans evolved in this one particular area when we have successfully progressed in so many other areas? 




  Again, what about things that aren't sentient that vegans won't eat? Barnacles, mussels, clams, oysters? You blatantly tried to divert the topic.

[Vegans are okay with eating those](http://sentientist.org/2013/05/20/the-ethical-case-for-eating-oysters-and-mussels/) 




 I happen to think I can do a better job of evaluating the ethics of my actions than the typical lion, which is why I don't look to lions for my ethics (not to mention I have far better alternatives available to me than a lion does). 




 In that case I'm sure this will assuage your concerns:

 Our current treatment of other animals will certainly be seen as barbaric in the future. We are learning more and more that many other animals possess sophisticated inner lives, that they are capable of using tools, learning from and teaching one another, and complex communication. Intelligent animals like pigs undoubtedly experience intense suffering, boredom, and pain as a result of their treatment on contemporary farms.

Just as the past couple centuries has seen our circle of compassion extending to include far greater rights for women and people of differing races, the future will hold greater consideration for the suffering of other species as well. 




 The food chain shouldn't have anything to do with what we choose to eat. You will not become prey to any other animals if you start eating more plant foods. 




 First of all, humans are not at the top of the food chain. Animals at the top of the food chain would be ones that eat other predatory animals exclusively. Humans eat plant foods and some herbivorous animals, placing us far lower on the food chain.

If your concern is over the fact that you don't want to be eaten by other predatory animals, clearly the risk of this will not change simply because humans choose to eat more plant-based foods.

The "food chain" should not be the source we use to determine how to live ethically. 




 There are also parents who feed their babies non-vegan diets and kill them from malnutrition. Babies should be breast fed or fed infant formula. Parents who fail to do that are just irresponsible parents and it has no reflection on the healthfulness of appropriate vegan or non-vegan diets. 




 Do you think dairy farms actually keep cows around until they die of old age? Cows' milk production drops off as they age. Every dairy farm sends cows to slaughter.

[From Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle):

Domestic cows can live to 20 years, however those raised for dairy rarely live that long, as the average cow is removed from the dairy herd around age four and marketed for beef.

On top of this cows, like all mammals, only produce significant amounts of milk for a period after they have had a calf (they are inseminated on dairy farms to have about one calf per year according to Wikipedia). The male calves are of no use to the dairy industry, and are typically slaughtered for veal. So the slaughter of cattle is also supported in that sense by dairy consumption.

 Does it happen more frequently with vegans than non-vegans? In the unfortunate cases where it does happen is it actually attributable to the diet being vegan or is it due to some other factor?

Those are questions that the organizations I cited look into before publishing their statements. I'm willing to bet that whatever sensationalist news story you read did not look into those questions.

The scientific consensus behind the position that appropriately planned vegan diets are healthy for all stages of life is overwhelming. 




 Every major dietetic association in the world agrees that appropriately planned vegan diets are healthy for all stages of life, and they nearly all encourage breast feeding of infants.

 I expect Action For Animals to have the tour schedule worked out within the next 2-3 weeks, so they will let you know by then. 




 We had someone bail while I was on tour in 2013 and it messed things up for us quite a bit. 

Can you let me know what shows you might be able to do? I'll check once a schedule has been put together and see if we are still shorthanded for any of those shows. 




 Send a follow up e-mail to your original e-mail letting Action For Animals know that you are interested now. They are trying to work out a schedule for all the shows and that would be good for them to know as they are planning. 




 No. Action For Animals has wristbands that will get volunteers into the shows. When you get to the show you will give one of the volunteers who is travelling with the Tour a call and we will come out and find you to let you in.

 Congrats, that's an awesome position! 




 [Unfortunately, the district attorney has already decided not to press any charges](http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/no-charges-for-colorado-farmworkers-videotaped-hitting-pigs/).

If what was revealed in this video wasn't criminal then the laws need to be fixed. 




 [ChooseVeg.com](http://www.chooseveg.com/) is a great resource for people looking to include less meat in their diets.

Reddit also has awesome communities at /r/vegetarian, /r/vegan, /r/vegrecipes, and /r/veganrecipes! 




 If companies can get away with treating animals terribly and allowing their workers to outright abuse animals while still selling their product and making a profit then they will continue to do so. Corporations care about what consumers are buying. 




 But instead of doing that, factory farmers are pushing for [ag-gag laws](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ag-gag) all across the country so they can continue to treat animals terribly while not having to worry about their terrible treatment of animals being exposed to the public. 




 Reddit was also outraged when some tourists lit a quokka on fire in New Zealand, but then we got even more outraged when commenters asked why we were outraged about the quokka while remaining apathetic about all the other animals that are commonly treated poorly. 




 lol, I would have taken it as a joke, but unfortunately far too many people say those things seriously. 




 I certainly appreciated meat. I ate a lot of meat growing up and enjoyed the taste as much as anyone.

Unfortunately, just because something is natural doesn't mean that it is ethical. For example, humans have waged war for millennia. We even see tribal clashes between different groups of great apes. Could anything be more natural? Yet I think we can both recognize that despite being natural we both would condemn unnecessary warfare.

To determine if something is ethical we must look at both the benefits (such as my enjoyment of meat), and the negatives (the harm caused to other animals). As much as I enjoyed the taste of meat, there was little doubt that the harm caused to other animals outweighed these benefits in almost all cases. (One exception might be a food like oysters. While they are technically animals they possess a very minimal nervous system.) 




 Also, /u/YawnY86's long comment said nothing about what is best for the cows. It was simply how their farm maximizes profit at auction. It is incredibly telling how many people in the industry lose the ability to differentiate between what cows might appreciate and what maximizes a farmer's profits. 




 If meat could be produced without any harm to animals I would have no ethical objections to consuming it and would likely eat it on occasion. 




 [Like this](http://store.afa-online.org/product.php?productid=17410 cat=0 page=1)?

Action For Animals has a couple other colors as well if you look through their store. All the money you spend there goes to supporting Action For Animals' activism! 




 Vegans are actually largely supporting and even funding the push for synthetic meat. [Here is an essay from Ingrid Newkirk](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/04/20/magazine/ethics-eating-meat.html?_r=0) (president of PETA. ^I ^know ^they ^suck ) about how she is excited to eat meat for the first time in 40 years once it can be synthesized.

As much as reddit likes to circlejerk about vegans needing to feel special that really isn't why people choose to be vegan.

[Here is a quote from the animal rights group Vegan Outreach](http://www.veganoutreach.org/advocacy/path.html):

We want a vegan world, not a vegan club. 




 You should share your tofu recipe in the /r/vegan thread for simple vegan recipes. 




 Hey, it's that woman who abuses her chickens by letting them eat their own eggs!
 




 Recipe for /u/test_subject7471's steamed vegetables:

1. Purchase cook-in-bag frozen vegetables.
2. Insert in microwave for amount of time indicated on bag.
 




 I read the comment /u/PumpkinMomma is referring to. I would have found that pretty insulting.  




 Did you look at the other comments about what a great prank this is? People clearly understand that this is a prank and not the most effective way to advocate for animal rights.

We can enjoy humor on this subreddit too. 




 We had a thread from an omni a couple weeks ago saying what a friendly and welcoming community they thought /r/vegan is. I have to say that I have found this community to live up to that reputation as well, and the only hatemongering I see is in posts that try to condemn us all with a single brush.

I do find your second paragraph to be quite telling however. Eating animal products is not merely a personal choice as it does not simply impact oneself. It causes harm to the animals being slaughtered and consumed as well. Vegans view this treatment of animals as being unethical. If you view every comment on the vegan subreddit that says "using animals in this way is wrong" as being hatemongering then it is hardly a surprise that you reach the conclusion that this subreddit is hateful.  




 It is produced by bacteria. It is vegan. 




 I want my own brussel-sprout-hatred ever after story. 




 I ate a vegetable once and I almost puked. How can vegans compare this to REAL foods like chicken nuggets?

Finally, I guarantee that you know some of [these famous vegans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_vegans) who look quite healthy. 




 There isn't going to be any product on the market that tastes exactly identical to meat, but there certainly are products that are indistinguishable in certain settings. I have seen taste tests with vegan sausages and vegan ground meat where people were fed these alternatives and conventional meats and they were unable to identify which was which.

People's perception of these products also plays a strong role in how they will claim the products taste. I have seen research on protein bars where they fed people the bar with a wrapper that either said, "contains 9 grams of protein" or "contains 9 grams of soy protein". Despite the bars being identical, the people who received the "soy protein" wrapper rated the product as tasting much worse, but they perceived it as being healthier. 

There isn't anything on the market today that will replicate a 12 oz  chunk of steak, but there are indistinguishable alternatives for many of the settings in which people eat meat today, as long as you go into it without prejudiced expectations based upon knowing the product is vegan. In addition to this for the meats that are not yet being replicated, many of the vegan alternatives on the market are still delicious in their own right and can be a new food that many people would enjoy having added into their diet.

Finally, tastes vary from person to person, so the only way to really discover which foods you like best are to try them out for yourself. 




 [ChooseVeg.com](http://www.chooseveg.com/) is a great resource for people looking to add more plant-based foods to their diet. 




 [My favorite picture from that site](https://nakedvegancooking.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/cranachan.jpg) 




 You're not at the top of the food chain. An animal that exclusively eats other carnivorous animals, would be at the top of the food chain. That said, the food chain isn't something that tells us how we ought to behave either, it is merely a description of the current state of nature (you cannot derive an ought from an is). 

Clearly you don't need to worry about becoming prey for another animal just because you have chosen to eat more plant-based foods. Your position in that sense is safe. 




 [The actor in that scene went vegan after filming the movie](http://www.humanesociety.org/news/magazines/2015/01-02/unprejudiced-heart-interview-with-babe-actor-james-cromwell.html):

It also inspired me to become vegan. After having worked all morning with these extraordinary animals, I'd see their relatives on the lunch table. They had ham and duck, every animal except horse. That's when I said, "I've got to try to be a vegan." And for the most part, I have been vegan since 1994. 




 Choosing to become vegetarian or vegan isn't going to solve all of the world's problems or even all of the problems with how animals are treated today, but it is something simple that each and every one of us can do that will make a world of difference for those animals who will be spared a life of unimaginable misery thanks to our choices. Reddit has excellent communities at /r/vegetarian, /r/vegan, /r/VegRecipes, and /r/veganrecipes for anyone who is interested in adding more plant-based foods into their diet. I'm thrilled to see redditors caring more and more about how our choices in what we eat impact other animals. 




 If demand declines cows won't be starved. As demand declines fewer cows will be bred to meet the lower demand. 




 While I am not pictured in the photograph, I am comfortable with you thinking that I am any of the four individuals in this image. 




 Well there is a difference in that sea world keeps tens of animals in captivity, while tens of billions of animals are kept on factory farms (and then slaughtered). I would say that is a difference of roughly a factor of a billion.

 What differentiates things like hunting for sport that people do presumably because they enjoy it from people who are only eating meat because they enjoy the taste of it?

 1. It isn't true.

 Commercial free-range egg production isn't much better. Producers still compete with one another to cut costs at the expense of the animals' well being.

[Here is a picture of a free-range egg laying operation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-range_eggs#/media/File:Free-range-hens.jpg) 




 You can promote a vegan product to omnivores without encouraging them to consume more non-vegan products at the same time. I have [successfully shared several vegan recipes on non-vegan subreddits](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/search?q=test_subject7471 restrict_sr=on sort=relevance t=all) without having to compromise on my values. The harm they are causing by encouraging people to use chicken breasts almost certainly outweighs the good of getting a few more people to try Daiya.  




 How did you come across the movie Fowl Play?

[Here is a link to Fowl Play on YouTube -[50:25]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiOR6XTXzsE) for anyone else who is interested. 




 The school cafeteria is going to point you to a food service company. If you're lucky they will tell you a packaging/manufacturing or some other wholesaler that they get a specific product from. That company may source product from one or dozens of places that refine ingredients, which they are unlikely to divulge. Finally the ingredient refiners probably source from hundreds of farms. 

It is going to be very difficult to trace the chain back all the way to a farm.

 I agree. Bullfighting is still incredibly cruel, but too many people glaze over the fact that the way animals are treated on today's farms is even worse. 




 I'm sure there will be a post soon about how vegans need to stop hatefully shoving our views about cutting on the bias down the throats of lacto-ovo vegetarians (since obviously /r/vegetarian is only for lacto-ovos). Then we will have to keep all posts that mention cutting on the bias on /r/vegan too. 




 [You wanna fight? I'll take you down so hard!](http://i.imgur.com/kHRKOcu.gifv) 




 What about their sensitive vegetarian feelings when they see how much better we look than they do? 




 I was really reluctant to become vegan even after I found out more about how terribly animals are treated for dairy and egg production (and slaughtered all the same). I tried signing up on the Vegan Freak forums though since I really liked their podcast, but I told them that going vegan was too hard for me. They were a bunch of meanies and told me that my excuses sucked and that their forums were a safe place for vegans only.

I decided to give veganism a shot since I wanted to be a part of the forums, and 7 years later I couldn't be more happy that I did! 




 Are you saying we need to start posting more nudes to /r/vegetarian? I suppose I could help out. 




 I usually recommend [ChooseVeg.com](http://www.chooseveg.com/) to omnis who might be interested in adopting a diet with fewer animal products. It is run by Mercy For Animals and everything they promote is entirely vegan. 




 Don't worry, on /r/vegan we have lots of talk about our awesome vegan poops. 




 I'm not sure if your comment is sarcastic or not. Clearly there are still issues with things like factory farming that nobody should support whether they are omni, lacto-ovo, or vegan. 




 Woah, if you are trying to disagree with something that a lacto-ovo vegetarian says you can only do that over at /r/vegan! 




 I'm not sure how I feel about getting multiplied by carnistscum. 




 Seriously, if she wants to not eat dairy and eggs that is her personal choice, but it is my right to consume these products that don't harm anyone. It's not like anyone is going to cry if I choose to drink milk, and it's not like anyone gets ground up alive so that I can eat eggs. 

If you vegans want to disagree with me on that point then you can only say that over at /r/vegan where nobody here will have to listen to you. 




 Oh come on, I have contributed enough to this subreddit to earn my place on the list of people you don't like. 




 Why don't you do your thing over at /r/meatfreediet? If people want to only hear about what you like then they'll join you over there.

/r/vegetarian is a place for discussing all types of vegetarian diets and that includes vegan ones. 




 You keep acting like vegans aren't also vegetarians. The purpose of /r/vegetarian is to promote vegetarian lifestyles and that includes vegan ones. 




 People need to be careful about what they say or they could make someone cry like a baby calf that has been separated from his mother.  




 The purpose of /r/vegetarian is whatever vegetarians are interested in. That is a wide variety of topics, some of which also includes harm caused to animals by production of some vegetarian foods. If something is upvoted that tends to be a pretty good sign that vegetarians find it relevant to the subreddit. We don't need additional censorship from the mods. 




 But I have to be careful to only consider the feelings of the people on /r/literallyhitler, and not the ~~jews~~ chickens that are being gassed, right? 




 You aren't the one suffering. The animals are the ones being oppressed. Vegans aren't oppressing vegetarians by discussing issues pertaining to the treatment of other animals on this subreddit. 

People who care about how animals are treated, which I would argue is the majority of this subreddit, want to see discussions on the topic, even if it goes beyond simply how eating the flesh of animals is bad for animals. 




 It was my thread that they are accusing of vegetarian-shaming! 




 60% of my redditing is done from my throne of moral superiority. 




 I happen to be reading Nick Cooney's new book on the subject right now. 

[How To Be Great At Doing Good by Nick Cooney on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/How-Be-Great-Doing-Good-ebook/dp/B00SZ6378S/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8 sr= qid=) 




 One cruel step in an incredibly cruel system. 




 The cage free picture is from [this Sierra Club article](http://www.sierraclub.org/chicago/sierra/2015-2-march-april/feature/local-roots-vs-industrial-agriculture#8)

The Free Range picture is from [the Wikipedia article on free range eggs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-range_eggs)

The organic picture is from [this CBS news article](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/trouble-in-the-henhouse-the-scam-of-organic-eggs/) 




 Here's the thing that people frequently miss when judging the environmental impact of local products versus far away products. If you buy steak or any other product from 5,000 miles away they aren't putting that one steak in a car and having someone drive it 5,000 miles. They are loading 10,000 lbs of product onto a truck/airplane and shipping all of that. If you bought 1lb of steak your portion of that is equivalent to roughly half a mile of transport. If you drove an extra 5 miles to find a place that sells locally sourced meat that is going to be roughly 10 times as harmful as buying the meat from across the country if you as an individual drive a shorter distance to pick it up.

Then again, none of this actually looks at how the animals are treated.  The places where lots of people live aren't able to produce lots of products that rely upon vast open land area to be produced. To meet a city's increasing demand for local products it is only possible if it becomes increasingly intensive and increasingly confined. 




 [Here are pictures of cage-free, free-range, and organic egg laying operations](http://imgur.com/a/fp7C0). They are also all local to somewhere. 




 Yeah dawg 




 If I've learned one thing about nutrition from vegans it is eat a lot of just one thing. Too much variety is never healthy in your diet. 




 They're all sleeping right now. Probably dreaming about eating vegan fish and chips. 




 Why would things only matter if they exist indefinitely? If it doesn't matter that you have had a positive impact for 100 years or 100 million years into the future, why would longer or indefinite periods of time make your impact matter? 




 I'm not impossible. I'm right here. 




 Did Dave talk to you a bunch about getting snipped while you were on tour with him? 




 The same thing that happened to all the people who were working in VCR factories, retailers, and repair shops when people stopped buying VCRs. They will find new jobs. Most likely ones that utilize similar skill sets. 




 Check out [VeganBodyBuilding.com](http://veganbodybuilding.com/) 




 Won the lottery and one step closer to getting your shiny vegan badge! 




 Plant foods are great sources of B-vitamins with the exception of vitamin B12.

Vitamin B12 isn't costly to get anywhere. It is produced by bacteria, and can only be reliably obtained from animal based foods, fortified foods, or a supplement. 




 A multivitamin costs less than $0.10 per day. Tons of foods like cereals and soy milks are fortified as well. 




 You haven't made a case for why either one of those things is okay. Killing animals for either of those reasons probably is not acceptable. 




 I have heard that vegan foods are so low in nutrients that vegans need to eat a mountain of food every day just to be able to survive. 




 The real key is the fiber. Studies have found that 99% of omnis suffer from pernicious fiber deficiency, and this can lead to digestive duress, bad stories for their poop blogs, and even death. This looks like a healthy (and delicious) high fiber meal. 




 /u/BlizeH. I also got an additional 1 quid (also from BlizeH) since I made the above comment. 




 I was hoping to see this as a gif 




 So far I have earned $1 and 6 months of reddit gold from my activism. Well on my way to retirement! 




 This is a gif that I submitted to /r/aww and /r/gifs today. There are a lot of good comments on the /r/gifs submission. 




 It is a loving cow. 




 A big part of getting the price down is having the capital to begin mass producing product and begin getting product out to lots of stores/people very efficiently. The large investment is a good sign that this product could be at a very competitive price. 




 Any other pangolins out there?

 I hope to see this on the front page tomorrow. 




 Use the .gifv file format. Actual .gif files take forever to load. Also that is a really good gif. 




 How do you know that someone thinks they could never be vegan?

Don't worry, they'll tell you. 




 That /u/infinity guy is really popular. I wish I got as many username mentions as he does.

(My username starts with a lowercase L) 




 Oh no! I don't want to kill anything!  :P 




 There are a couple people who keep accusing my gifs of being a secret vegan plot to control reddit (or something like that). 

I'm not trying to be secretive about what I'm doing. I'm vegan and I'm thrilled when more people choose to cut back on animal products, especially when it is because of one of my posts. All I'm doing though is sharing content that I appreciate and that I think other redditors will appreciate too. There's nothing secretive or sinister about that. 




 Yeah, I do a good amount of leafleting and tabling. I donate to Animal Charity Evaluators' recommended charities. I started an animal rights club back in college. I have toured as a volunteer with Action For Animals at the Warped Tour for the past couple years and I'm planning to do it for a little over a week again this summer.

That sounds like a lot, but I really still am a normal guy most of the time. I could/should be doing much more. 




 I wonder how /u/infinity feels about getting all these username mentions. 




 Really?  In the "What is philosophy?" guidelines to posting it mentions, "Value Theory, which includes ethics/moral philosophy, political philosophy, aesthetics, and similar areas."

I can't see how this would not fall under that umbrella. 




 Record it on video and upload it to YouTube so that we can show even more omnis! 




 [Here it is](http://i.imgur.com/99X3uRh.gifv) 




 [This is my favorite gif of pigs eating](http://i.imgur.com/IovOTlX.gifv) 




 Pigs are such incredible animals... [Look at this one doing a puzzle!](http://i.imgur.com/O6h0DPM.gifv) 




 This is my favorite comment. :) 




 There are other gay vegan dudes in the South right now thinking to themselves how much they would like to find someone who's vegan. 




  Maccas

Found the Australian! 




 I know that they raised a lot of money that they put toward improving their ability to distribute Soylent efficiently. I'm not sure if they have fixed all of the issues with the long wait times to distribute product yet, but I expect it to either be resolved by now or it will be soon. 




 It is difficult to really show if someone else feels pain. Fish respond to painkillers in ways that seem to suggest that pain is being relieved. [Here is a site which refers to some good studies about that](http://www.fishpain.com/fish-and-pain-analgesic.htm).

Also, this doesn't specifically deal with pain, but [Wikipedia has a good article on Fish Intelligence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_intelligence). 




 You should be upset. What they are doing is absolutely not okay. I'm sure their condesention and dismissive attitude is beyond frustrating as well. Don't try to get rid of that passion that you feel.

Keep in mind though that you aren't the one suffering. When reacting to your parents or anyone else think of what will be best for helping the animals, not what will feel most satisfying for you. Sometimes that might mean showing your frustration or telling someone off, but more often that means remaining cool and rational, acting like you understand where people are coming from, and presenting the animals' case in the most levelheaded way you can. 




 This is a case that will go down in history. When the future looks back at the abysmal treatment of most animals today they will point to this case as setting important precedent for securing non-human animals better protection under the law. 




 Thank you. 

First of all I want to thank my mom and dad for always being there for me. Gotta thank the big man upstairs. And of course all those fans out there who upvoted me. I couldn't have done it without you guys. 




 Pig farmer Bob Comis who holds himself to the highest standards of animal welfare writes, "I cannot think of one sound ethical argument in favor of slaughtering animals for their meat." After years getting to know the personalities of the animals he raises, he questions whether it is right for him to go on in the industry. 




 If I had to compare the taste to something I would say it tastes something like pancake batter, but I think it is more enjoyable than drinking straight pancake batter would be. It definitely works for keeping me full and keeping my energy levels up. 




 I have given up on dating omnis. We don't share enough in common and it is much too emotionally draining to see someone you care about regularly acting in ways that you find to be unethical. I am content with being single until I can find a worthwhile vegan girlfriend. 




 There are tons of cosmetics available that aren't tested on animals and do not contain animal products. That said, what someone's mom does should have no impact on that person's ability to speak up about what is right and wrong. 




 I remember hearing something from them about raising a lot of capital to improve their ability to distribute their product more efficiently (it took almost 4 months for me to receive my order). I wouldn't be surprised to see them making international shipping available soon. 




 I can't wait to hear why people shouldn't be able to protest animal abuse if their moms wear makeup... 




 I have been using it for the past month or so. The taste is unobjectionable and it is incredibly convenient. I don't use it at normal meals, but if I don't feel like making anything or if I'm putting off a trip to the supermarket it is great to have around. I'm sure it would be great to take along while backpacking or travelling too. 




 They don't do any of those things. 




 They do not. 




 Have you considered just getting some [soylent](http://www.soylent.me/) to bring with you to places where you may not have many food options? 




 This gives me an idea of something to try. Sharing videos with people that have vegan videos in the related videos or as the "Up Next" video in the sidebar. 




 The average person also doesn't live to 80 years old without scientific interventions. You benefit every day from iodized salt, fortified breakfast cereals, enriched flour, and countless other fortified foods. We should embrace the better choices we can continue to make in the future thanks to today's technological advances.

 Let me quote /u/paleolitech:

Vegans abuse less plants you idiot, the inefficiency of animals (80% at best, 5% at worst) means you will indirectly kill 20% to 95% more plants in your lifetime than the average vegan.

And before you insult me or accuse me of "Lol PETA asshole", I mod /r/anti_vegan, so you know you're an idiot when even somebody critical of veganism calls you out on your BULLSHIT.

And HOOOOOLY FUCK, it's funny how you people are outraged somebody lit a little animal on fire then instantly reduce said animal to the non-conciousness of plants in seconds, all to make yourselves feel better.

Fucking idiotic.

  A system of moral principles are views of right and wrong ~~enforce by a society~~. Since not eating meat is not enforced nor viewed as bad by society, it is by definition ethical.

Using that first definition your conclusion does not follow. 

The dictionary's example works that the ethics of a culture are a system of moral principles of a culture. That doesn't mean that the word can only refer to the moral principles of a culture or society. It refers, as the definition states, to a system of moral principles.

Your argument is being mocked on /r/badphilosophy. I don't think you can claim that vegans are the only ones who find holes in your reasoning.

 




 No, you were not using definition #1. Definition #1 does not limit the system of moral principles to only those held by society as a whole. Your argument relied upon that point. 




 [Dictionary.com definitions of "ethics"](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ethics?s=t)

1. (used with a singular or plural verb) a system of moral principles:
*the ethics of a culture.*


2. the rules of conduct recognized in respect to a particular class of human actions or a particular group, culture, etc.:
*medical ethics; Christian ethics.*

3. moral principles, as of an individual:
*His ethics forbade betrayal of a confidence.*

4. (usually used with a singular verb) that branch of philosophy dealing with values relating to human conduct, with respect to the rightness and wrongness of certain actions and to the goodness and badness of the motives and ends of such actions.

You seem to have used definition 2 as if it was the only definition. When clearly definition 1 fits far better for how the term is frequently used and used in the context to which you are attempting to respond. And definition 3 states that ethics and morals can be used interchangeably contrary to your entire argument.

 You are awesome. 




 Relative to the RDA, oats are higher in protein than carbs or fat. 




 I would still try to make choices that cause as little pain as possible. 




 Right now you are benefiting from eating countless fortified foods. Iodine deficiency has plummeted since the advent of iodized salt. You eat enriched flour and breakfast cereals fortified with dozens of vitamins and minerals. You can't recreate these things without relying on the store.

Other animals do not possess all of the capacities that a typical human would have, but they show responses that appear quite similar to our own reactions to suffering when treated in many of the ways that would cause us to suffer.

[Utilitarianism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism) is a common school of ethical thought amongst vegans. Utilitarians view an action as good if it maximizes the amount of goodness (generally judged as increasing pleasure or happiness, and minimizing pain or suffering) that is expected to occur as a result. While many ethical vegans will openly admit that they enjoy the taste of meat (evidenced by the numerous meat alternatives available for vegans today), they recognize that the harm caused to other animals to produce these products almost certainly exceeds the pleasure they gain as a result. The boycott that is veganism lessens demand for these products, and correspondingly supply will decrease as a result.

Another way of expressing this is in the principle of [equal consideration of interests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_consideration_of_interests). That is to say that the interest of any individual should be given equal consideration where, and to the extent that the interest exists. This isn't to say that all interests are equal, experienced equally, or that all animals possess interests, but that where there are interests, we should weight that interest proportionally to the intensity of the interest and not discriminate on any other basis.
 




 Those are factual statements. I'm not following how you get from there to how we ought to behave.

I can say. "Humans have waged war for millennia. Violence is natural." However, I still condemn unnecessary violence. Wouldn't you? 




 I happen to think I am more capable of making informed ethical decisions, but if you think other animals are smarter than you are then I can see why you would look to them to guide your ethics. 




 So is it because something has happened for a long time that you think makes it okay, or are you trying to suggest that humans have evolved eating meat therefore it cannot be healthy to not eat meat? Could you flesh out this position a bit more? 




 Vegan Outreach shared it on Facebook. 




 I see that there is another party called "Shooters and Fishers" that won two seats. [This appears to be a political party centered around protecting people's "right" to hunt and fish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooters_and_Fishers_Party).  

*sigh* 




 I want my beliefs to be able to stand up to all accurate information. If there is information that would challenge my beliefs then it is my beliefs that should change, not the information that should be silenced. 




 If you lived in a violent and bloody society you wouldn't just be the one committing the violence. You would also live in fear of or perhaps be the victim of violence against yourself.

This isn't just hypothetical either. Humans have waged war and participated in tribal violence for millennia. We even see other great apes occasionally engaging in territorial skirmishes with neighboring groups. What could possibly be more natural? 

Yet when you look at a terrible and bloody war taking place right now you would never simply say, "oh, it is just natural so that makes it okay." None of us really believe that nature should be the arbiter of our ethics. 
























 I run a fun, small subreddit: /r/SummerScavengerHunt. Every year on June 1st we share a scavenger hunt list.

Here are some of the items people submitted for last year's scavenger hunt:

 Is there any other ethical question where you say, "if you're able to commit the action yourself then that makes it okay?" That seems really out of line with how most people feel about other ethical issues. 




 A century ago when orangutan populations were relatively undisturbed there were roughly 230,000 in the wild. Today roughly 50,000 remain. [Source](http://wwf.panda.org/what_we_do/endangered_species/great_apes/orangutans/)

Even for the production of vegan foods it is likely that many millions of animals every year lose their lives. It is tragic that any animals die, but palm oil is not unusually harmful to animals compared to other foods we have available. 




 You don't get to just be ethical some of the time when it is convenient or when you feel like it. Being ethical means evaluating all of your choices and considering how your actions impact others. 

An ethical person also isn't someone who just considers how their actions impact certain groups that they deem worthy. In order to be ethical you need to consider the impact your actions have on all others. There is no reason why that should only include humans. 




 Oh, vegan diets are by no means an anti-keto diet. There are actually large communities at /r/vegetarianketo and /r/veganketo. I was just trying to show that the healthfulness of vegan diets is backed up by solid evidence.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

 Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

  why would I go vegan?

You were "vegan" [here](http://np.reddit.com/r/news/comments/31n10f/federal_report_vegan_diet_best_for_planet_a/cq5mmc4) and [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/2y0oj5/sharing_an_apple/cp5hoqg). Why don't you ask yourself? 




 India is doing very well in terms of health compared to countries with a similar GDP per capita. Obviously they aren't going to be as healthy as a much wealthier nation that can afford far better health services.  




 Just like all those rich vegetarians in India - all marching down to buy whatever expensive foods they want from their local Whole Foods /sarcasm

The world's poor rely upon cheap staples like rice, beans, and cassava that are all vegan. Meat is considered a luxury by most people on this planet. You need to be completely out of touch to think not eating meat is only for rich people. 




 I clicked on both of your links under the header "vegan children don't grow normally". One of them studied vegetarian children and said their height was within the normal range. The other was about macrobiotic diets.  




 Did you give up on pretending to be vegan? 




 That's unfortunate that your wife is struggling with anemia. Clearly her current meat heavy diet isn't sufficient to meet her needs. While taking iron supplements is probably a good start, there are many other factors that can increase or decrease iron absorption (for example consuming vitamin C with iron will increase absorption, while foods containing phytic acid will decrease absorption). There is no reason why she would have to rely upon meat as a superior source of iron. 

Finally, nobody is pushing anything upon you by simply writing something on the internet. Feminists aren't forcing their beliefs upon others when they say that women should receive equal pay for equal work or when they say all women should have the opportunity to receive a basic education. As Elie Wiesel famously wrote: 

We must take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented. Sometimes we must interfere.

The people who are pushing their beliefs on others are those who are forcing animals to live lives in terrible conditions of confinement and who force these animals to ultimately be slaughtered for their meals.   




 There are large communities of people over at /r/vegetarianketo and /r/veganketo surviving on the sort of diet you are proposing without any meat. That said, following the sort of diet you propose is still vastly outside of mainstream dietary advice (despite being perfectly possible as a vegan). 

The American Dietetic Association addresses Omega-3s in their position paper. I'm much more inclined to trust the world's most prominent dietetic organization on the subject (who also cites peer reviewed research to back up their position) than I am inclined to take your word on it. 




 Every major dietary organization in the world has published statements saying appropriately planned vegan diets are healthy for all stages of life. Anyone who rejects that is radically outside of the overwhelming scientific consensus.

**INGREDIENTS**

Mushrooms: 

* 2 portobello mushrooms, sliced
* 3 garlic cloves, minced
* 1 tbsp. olive oil
* 2 tbsp. balsamic vinegar
*  tsp. salt

Dough:

* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* 2 tsp. instant dry yeast
* 1 tsp. sugar
* 1 tsp. salt
*  cup warm water (105-115F)
* 2 tbsp. olive oil 

Guacamole:

* 3 large avocados, ripe (soft not squishy)
* 2 garlic cloves, minced
*  lime
* 1 small tomato, diced
*  red onion, diced
* Salt


**Instructions: ** 

Guacamole: 

1. Cut your avocados in half and remove pit. Spoon out avocado into a medium bowl. Add in garlic, salt, and freshly squeezed lime. Mash avocado until smooth. Add the tomatoes and onion, stirring until combined. Cover and refrigerator until chilled, probably a good hour. Give it a taste test to see if it needs more salt or lime.

Mushrooms:

1. Preheat oven to 425F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Toss the portobellos in a large mixing bowl with the olive oil, salt, balsamic vinegar, and garlic. Mix gently until combined and all mushrooms are coated. Place onto baking sheet and cook for 15 minutes. Remove and set aside.

Crust:

1. Add the water and oil to the bowl of your stand mixer. In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, sugar, yeast, and salt. Attach the dough hook to your stand mixer and start the mixer on low. Carefully add the flour mixture to the wet mixture, increasing the speed of the mixer as needed. Mix until the dough forms a ball and clears the sides of the mixer.
2. Lightly flour your counter. Place the dough on top and knead until smooth and elastic, between 5-7 minutes. Lightly grease the bowl of your stand mixer and set the dough inside, rotating the bowl so the dough becomes coated in oil. Cover and set aside for 1 hour (or until dough has doubled in size.)
3. When ready to use, preheat oven to 475F. Deflate the dough by punching it and pouring onto your floured countertops. Roll out into a large size pizza crust and place onto your pizza pan. Brush dough with olive oil and bake for 10-12 minutes, or until golden brown and desired consistency is reached.

Pizza assembly:

1. Spread the guacamole across your COOKED pizza dough. Once smooth, top with the portobello mushrooms. Cut and serve!

 That is because vitamin B12 is produced exclusively by bacteria. There are tons of foods fortified with vitamin B12 and a supplement costs pennies per day. This is not an insurmountable hurdle. 




 You mean amino acids, not proteins. The same amino acids are used by all known life forms though, so these are by no means easier to get from meat than from a plant-based diet.

  I put mushrooms, beans, tomatoes, avocado, corn and so on until /u/test_subject7471 comes over and eats all my food.

FTFY

 




 Nope. I spend 40 hours per week working for a company that administers health insurance and pension plans. I do volunteer with animal rights groups in my free time in addition to sharing things on reddit. 




 Also /u/tyroneking deserves a lot of credit for [this comment](http://np.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/36qv3n/laying_down_with_a_cow/crgfw1u). 




 I'm vegan for the animals, but my health, the environment, and personal superiority are nice added benefits! 




 Those first three are all gifs that I made and shared. That last one was someone else. 




 Check out /r/veganrecipes. It is a great place to find ideas for delicious meals that are egg-free! 




 Once again, how would it even hypothetically be possible to show that plants feel pain? What sort of experiment could be conducted? 




 You're welcome. :-D 




 How could a study even hypothetically show that?

I am familiar with the sensational news stories that get published every time a new piece of research comes out about plants reacting to stimuli. While the research is fascinating, rocks also react when kicked and light bulbs react when an electric current is passed through them. That doesn't mean that rocks and light bulbs can feel.  



















 Note: I did not write this. A friend of mine who works for the Humane League shared this.

I went vegan after receiving a leaflet on the horrors of the animal industry. This was handed to me four years ago, when I visited my cousin's college. I would like to pay this forward now by taking a more active role in animal advocacy at my university. I recently realized that to be the best vegan I can, I have to change not just myself, but influence others as well. With The Humane League's resources and support, I will enthusiastically work to increase people's knowledge on the environmental and ethical problems of animal farming, and hopefully spur them to action--and to veganism! 


































 There are a few people saying it is vegetarian-shaming, but people also said that last time I posted a picture that essentially said, "be nice to animals". 




 There are plenty of people who give up on their vegetarianism, and hopefully seeing a reminder of why being vegetarian is so important will encourage people to maintain their vegetarianism. Furthermore, simply being vegetarian isn't everything that we can be doing to help these animals. We can donate to animal rights groups, get involved in animal rights activism, cut dairy and eggs out of our diets, and much more. Hopefully people here who already care about these issues will do more to help after seeing just how tragic videos like this are, not just for this one cow, but for millions of other similar cows. 




 I don't see anyone attacking anyone. The only critical comments in this thread are in response to the person who said they wish they were as lucky as that cow. 



























































 I enjoyed it, I'm glad he did it, but there was way too much, "you could stop eating chicken, but you're not going to do that." 

A piece like that needs to have the guts to say, "we *should* stop eating chicken." Without that it will only have a tiny fraction of the impact that it otherwise could. 




 I'm not the person who wrote the message, so I couldn't tell you. 




 I have been vegan for the past 7 years. Ultimately ethical veganism is a boycott intended to lessen the demand for animal products. Other animals do not possess all of the capacities that a typical human would have, but they show responses that appear quite similar to our own reactions to suffering when treated in many of the ways that would cause us to suffer.

[Utilitarianism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism) is a common school of ethical thought amongst vegans. Utilitarians view an action as good if it maximizes the amount of goodness (generally judged as increasing pleasure or happiness, and minimizing pain or suffering) that is expected to occur as a result. While many ethical vegans will openly admit that they enjoy the taste of meat (evidenced by the numerous meat alternatives available for vegans today), they recognize that the harm caused to other animals to produce these products almost certainly exceeds the pleasure they gain as a result. The boycott that is veganism lessens demand for these products, and correspondingly supply will decrease as a result.

Another way of expressing this is in the principle of [equal consideration of interests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_consideration_of_interests). That is to say that the interest of any individual should be given equal consideration where, and to the extent that the interest exists. This isn't to say that all interests are equal, experienced equally, or that all animals possess interests, but that where there are interests, we should weight that interest proportionally to the intensity of the interest and not discriminate on any other basis. 




 Most vegans don't care what you eat. They care about who you eat and who is harmed in the process of producing it. I think we can all agree that it is important to consider how our choices may harm other individuals. 




 I do not. A Facebook friend of mine who works there shared this. 





























 I am interested in interning with The Humane League because I was recently exposed to issues of farm animal cruelty when someone was handing out leaflets on my college campus. The leaflets included information about the abuse farm animals suffer and a quote about how it's odd that we cuddle some animals (our pets) but stick forks in others (farm animals). I have always been an animal lover and have been trying to become vegetarian for years, but this really hit home with me and I have become vegetarian. I think that spreading awareness about animal cruelty is the most efficient way to get people to understand it, as many people are unaware of the cruelty that occurs. I would love to be part of an organization that works to fight against this. 





























 Did you give that mouse a cookie? 




 Now I want to try hitting a PB J sandwich with a baseball bat and film it with my high speed camera.  




 Humans are not sentient. You're just anthropomorphizing. 




 You know me well.

I eat a lot of the foods featured in this fridge, but it is not mine. 



























































 The threads that were deleted because people's personal information was revealed, which also led to accounts being banned?

Are you trying to set me up? 




 There is overwhelming consensus that humans can be healthy on vegan diets. Once again, who cares if it is "natural" or not?

 We also don't commonly live to 80 years old in nature. We all benefit greatly from fortified foods like iodized salt, enriched flour, and fortified cereals. It is also recommended that [all pregnant women take a folic acid supplement](http://www.webmd.com/baby/folic-acid-and-pregnancy). We can, and already are doing things much better than nature thanks to supplements and fortified foods, and many other unnatural aspects of modern life.

On the other hand, humans have engaged in tribal violence for all of recorded history and we even see signs of it among other great apes, so war and violence seem very natural, but I think we would both agree that they are not good.

Simply stating whether or not something is natural tells us nothing about whether we ought to continue doing it going forward. 




 I'm not denying that vegans should either take a vitamin B12 supplement or eat fortified foods to ensure that they are getting an adequate supply. 




  Good luck getting your B12 without supplements.

B12 is a vitamin, not a protein. It is produced by bacteria. 




 /u/Zhaey deserves the credit. He compiled the list. 




 But will we ever be able to answer one of life's greatest questions?

 Yep! There is wide consensus on this point!

**[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**

 It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

**[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**

 A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.

**[The British National Health Service](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx)**

 With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.

**[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**

 A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

 Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**

 Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

**[The Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446)**

  A well-planned vegetarian diet (*see context*) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.

**[The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada](http://www.heartandstroke.com/site/c.ikIQLcMWJtE/b.3484249/k.2F6C/Healthy_living__Vegetarian_diets.htm)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can provide all the nutrients you need at any age, as well as some additional health benefits.

 Anything heated up over about 1000 Celsius will start glowing. 




 It could also mean you eat things that emit light. 














 [I shared this two days ago](http://np.reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews/comments/361zz5/chicken_runs_to_her_boy_for_a_hug_but_somethings/) :P 














 Someone else compiled the list. I think they wrote a program that did it. 




 I run a fun, small subreddit: /r/SummerScavengerHunt. Every year on June 1st we share a scavenger hunt list. Participants post photos and videos of themselves finding items or completing tasks from the scavenger hunt list and then the moderators award points to your team if the submission meets the criteria (teams can be one or two people). 

Here are some of the items people submitted for last year's scavenger hunt:

[#89 A drink with a phallic name that isn't Bawls](http://i.imgur.com/Lnmg5mh.jpg)

[#142 Someone in a banana suit](http://i.imgur.com/3x3JG8Z.jpg)

[#165 A banknote with a denomination larger than 1,000,000](http://i.imgur.com/K5fmlLE.jpg)

[#202 Make a pair of ice skates by attaching ice to the bottom of your shoes.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaXsKrmg4io feature=youtu.be)

[#260 Feed an animal (besides a human) a carrot out of your mouth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_qerX9uuK0 feature=youtu.be)

It would be great to have some more participants this year, so please subscribe and join in the competition! 




 In circumstances where no harm is caused to animals to produce an animal product then I have no ethical issue with using it. You will find this is frequently repeated position amongst vegans. For example, [here is an article about how it is ethical for vegans to eat oysters](http://sentientist.org/2013/05/20/the-ethical-case-for-eating-oysters-and-mussels/) (you can find several more articles along these lines with a Google search), and [here you can find an essay from Ingrid Newkirk about how she is excited to eat lab grown meat](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/04/20/magazine/ethics-eating-meat.html?_r=0).

I think with a little research you will quickly see that cruelty is still inherent in any commercial production of wool and eggs. I would say we don't understand the experiences of bees very well, but it is quite plausible given our current understanding that they suffer greatly as well. 

Finally, meat isn't going to be abolished tomorrow. Hopefully, demand for meat will decline down the road and fewer animals will be bred into existence to meet the lower demand. There are still wild or feral chickens, boars, and cattle living in several parts of the world, so their existence will continue. If down the road there comes a time when a majority of our society wishes to abolish meat then we can decide whether to outlaw the breeding of new farmed animals and allow the others to still be slaughtered or if we desire to invest in providing safe living conditions for the farm animals who are alive at that time to safely live out their lives. Stopping the mistreatment of animals for human consumption is not an insurmountable hurdle. 




 This really just goes to show your lack of understanding of why people choose to be vegan. While buying organic is completely unrelated to being vegan we are well aware that manure is often used as a fertilizer. 

Being vegan isn't about some dogmatic avoidance of any product with some arbitrary connection that can be drawn to some animal product. The Vegan Society (which coined the term "vegan") defines veganism as:

Veganism is a way of living that seeks to exclude, as far as possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing and any other purpose.

Veganism is about minimizing the harm we cause to others, which is a cause that most sensible people would get behind.

 Smile. Answer their questions politely (even if they are dumb).

You'll have to tell us what kind of outreach you are doing for more specific tips. 




 It is a food designed with the intention that people can eat it for every meal and meet all of their nutritional needs. My comment above is also a link to their website which explains it in much more detail. 




 I've had it. It definitely isn't gourmet, but I don't mind the flavor at all. It tastes a bit like pancake batter. 




 Is it vegan to eat a klein bottle? 




 I have watched Earthlings. It did get a lot of people to go vegan. It was not necessary to watch it to make that point.

 There are many mentally disabled children who can't grow up to be lawyers either, but that doesn't mean they should be treated the way we presently treat other animals. 




 I have considered myself part of the Effective Altruism movement since I read Peter Singer's book "The Life You Can Save" back in 2009.  




 I added him as a friend on Facebook a few months ago after seeing some of his really cringy earlier videos. He intends for his videos to be humorous, and while I agree many of them go too far into the awkward and cringy humor realm that invokes criticism, I thought this particular video was worth sharing. 

He is also doing a lot of other great animal rights activism work, such as having now passed out over 100,000 Vegan Outreach booklets on college campuses! 




  Every **sentient** being

 




 I run a fun subreddit: /r/SummerScavengerHunt. Every year on June 1st we share a scavenger hunt list. Participants post photos and videos of themselves finding items or completing tasks from the scavenger hunt list and then the moderators award points to your team if the submission meets the criteria (teams can be one or two people). 

Here are some of the items people submitted for last year's scavenger hunt:

[#89 A drink with a phallic name that isn't Bawls](http://i.imgur.com/Lnmg5mh.jpg)

[#142 Someone in a banana suit](http://i.imgur.com/3x3JG8Z.jpg)

[#165 A banknote with a denomination larger than 1,000,000](http://i.imgur.com/K5fmlLE.jpg)

[#202 Make a pair of ice skates by attaching ice to the bottom of your shoes.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaXsKrmg4io feature=youtu.be)

[#260 Feed an animal (besides a human) a carrot out of your mouth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_qerX9uuK0 feature=youtu.be) 




 I'm having the same problem. I'm doing a coffee cleanse where I drink 20 cups of coffee a day to cleanse my body of toxins, and I haven't been able to sleep at all! It must be because vegan diets are deficient in protein and essential nutrients. 




 I have read it. Good book, I encourage others to check it out. 




 I want to see more research about what works best for getting people to go vegan and/or reduce their consumption of animal products like [Humane League Labs](https://humaneleaguelabs.wordpress.com) is doing. They need more people donating to fund additional research. 




 Who do you think can afford to spend $4.00/lb for chicken, but can't spend $1 per pound for beans and rice? 




 Doesn't cultivating any land for any crop lead to loss of habitat? 




 I am not arguing that people don't enjoy the taste or convenience of animal products, but the point was made that they are "needed", which is false. 

People are a lot less sympathetic to those who say, "I kill animals because I enjoy it." 




 You can also get nutrition by eating human flesh. That doesn't mean you need to eat human flesh to get nutrition. There is strong scientific consensus that you also do not need any meat to have a healthy diet.

Whether or not you or I believe something has no impact on whether or not it is true. 

We should weigh the impact to people who raise and slaughter animals for a living in determining how we ought to behave (we should weigh the impact our actions have on everyone in determining how we ought to behave), but you can't argue in good faith that taking the lives of hundreds of thousands or millions of birds causes less harm than a chicken farmer having to make changes to their career.

 You aren't the only one who is impacted by your choice to eat meat. Animals suffer immensely as a result and meat production places a substantial burden on the environment which impacts everyone else as well. To the extent that your actions are harming others, it is valid for people to speak up about that. 




 PETA is certainly a group with significant shortcomings, but lets not forget that this campaign against PETA is driven by an industry lobbyist group, the [Center for Consumer Freedom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Consumer_Freedom), with the goal of conflating PETA with animal rights and setting the entire cause back.

Whenever you see these stories, please consider making a donation to a group doing actual work to help animals. [Here are charities that Animal Charity Evaluators has recommended as the most effective for helping animals](http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/recommendations/). PETA does not deserve your money, but animals should not be left to suffer because industry funded interests want to shut their opponents up entirely.

 I think you mean it is more environmentally friendly to buy soy milk. 




 Suppose meat producers have 10% uncertainty in how much meat they should produce, and vegans only make up 1% of the population. They would still, on average, produce less meat as a result of that 1% than they would if that 1% was eating meat.

Vegan diets do not need to be more expensive, but [most effective altruists agree that animal charities are some of the most effective groups we can be donating to for reducing suffering](http://reg-charity.org/effective-animal-charities/) (including human suffering). 




 Do you think dairy farms actually keep cows around until they die of old age? Cows' milk production drops off as they age. Every dairy farm sends cows to slaughter.

[From Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle):

Domestic cows can live to 20 years, however those raised for dairy rarely live that long, as the average cow is removed from the dairy herd around age four and marketed for beef.

On top of this cows, like all mammals, only produce significant amounts of milk for a period after they have had a calf (they are inseminated on dairy farms to have about one calf per year according to Wikipedia). The male calves are of no use to the dairy industry, and are typically slaughtered for veal. So the slaughter of cattle is also supported in that sense by dairy consumption. 




 The [Center For Consumer Freedom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Consumer_Freedom) (the group behind most of the anti-PETA campaign centered on their website petakillsanimals.com) also runs a website, humanewatch.org, dedicated to cricizing HSUS.

 Omnis cutting animals on the bias! Once again trying to mimic us vegans! 









 [Check out this fish playing sports](http://i.imgur.com/GPUQ1tx.gifv)! 




 I think this is an issue that needs to be approached from a utilitarian perspective. There certainly are benefits that can come from any sort of research, particularly medical research. On the other hand, experimenting on animals almost certainly causes them a great deal of misery. 

We ought to make every effort to minimize the harm caused by any experiment, maximize the expected benefit, and only allow experiments to be conducted if the expected benefit exceeds the expected amount of harm caused. 

That said, we presently tend to have a terrible bias of underestimating the harm our actions cause to non-human animals. At the same time there is no reason why this should only apply to non-human animals either. Humans are much better test subjects for studying human diseases. If we would gain far better knowledge by breeding humans to test upon instead of breeding chimpanzees and both groups would suffer much the same from an experiment, then there is no reasonable excuse for not testing on the humans.  



















 [Final Result](http://i.imgur.com/5lqqrct.jpg)

**Ingredients**

* A generous pinch cumin seeds
* 2 smallish waxy potatoes, peeled, quartered and sliced thinly across
* 5 fat cloves garlic, peeled and chopped
* 4 small bittergourds, topped, tailed, halved, seeds and pith scraped out then sliced thickly across
* Half a large daikon radish, peeled, quartered and sliced thinly across
* 3-4 fresh green chillies, sliced thickly across
* A generous pinch hot red pepper flakes
* 1 can thoroughly drained cooked chickpeas
* 1 level tsp sea salt (or to taste)
 
**Directions**

1. Heat about 3 tablespoons light vegetable oil (sunflower, soy, canola etc) in a deep pan or wok. When moderately hot, add the cumin seeds and stir for a few seconds, taking care that they don't burn.

2. Add the sliced potatoes and cook, stirring until potatoes begin to crisp. Add the garlic and continue to stir until garlic begins to brown.

3. Add in the sliced bittergourds and cook, stirring until they begin to brown at the edges. Stir in the sliced daikon and green chillies and cook, stirring often for about 3 minutes or until vegetables are almost done but still have some crunch.
Add the red pepper flakes, chickpeas and salt and stir for about 2 - 3 minutes or until chickpeas are thoroughly heated through.

4. Dish out and garnish with cilantro if you like. Serve immediately.

Add the red pepper flakes, chickpeas and salt and stir for about 2 - 3 minutes or until chickpeas are thoroughly heated through.

4. Dish out and garnish with cilantro if you like. Serve immediately.

 PETA is certainly a group with significant shortcomings, but lets not forget that this campaign against PETA is driven by an industry lobbyist group, the [Center for Consumer Freedom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Consumer_Freedom), with the goal of conflating PETA with animal rights and setting the entire cause back.

Singer is arguing for the principle of [Equal Consideration of Interests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_consideration_of_interests), which means that to the extent and degree that any being possesses interests their interests should be given consideration to the same extent and degree as any other being with similar interests, and we ought not discriminate on any other basis.

 There is overwhelming consensus among dietitians that appropriately planned vegetarian and vegan diets are healthy for all stages of life. The only people who could be called "fanatics" in this scenario are those that reject the scientific consensus.

**[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**

 It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

**[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**

 A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.

 With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.

**[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**

 A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

 Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**

 Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

 Don't let the negative comments bother you. Veganism isn't about some dogmatic avoidance of anything relating to kingdom animalia. It is about minimizing the harm our actions cause to animals as much as possible and practicable. If an animal does not possess the neurological capacity to be harmed in any meaningful sense then it is perfectly vegan to use/eat it.

 EU countries import 35 million tons of soy beans and soy meal from north and south America every year - to use as feed for pigs, chickens and cows.

Cultivation of primarily genetically modified soy for export uses land in developing countries that could go toward sustainable agriculture.

But even in industrialized countries like Germany, globalized industrial livestock farming presents a pollution problem.

"[Animal waste] is the root of considerable environmental problems in Germany, particularly in regions with intensive livestock farming," explained agrarian economist Knut Ehlers of the German Environment Agency.

Although manure is also a fertilizer, too much is toxic for soil and water. The environmental impacts of factory farming "ultimately fall on the taxpayer," said Ehlers.

Such agriculture is unsustainable, Ehlers stressed. He hopes that aiming more public attention to the issue of soil depletion on the national and EU levels will lead to more sustainable policy-making, and development of organic agriculture.

[Source](http://www.dw.de/loss-of-fertile-soils-a-food-security-risk/a-18395856)

Plant farms are taking on a part of the issue of the overwhelming amount of excessive manure and waste generated by animal agriculture, and yet you are trying to throw them under the bus for not being entirely self-reliant? We have many other fertilizer options available. Be grateful that these farms take on some of the waste that you create. 




 Shh... Don't tell the NSA. 




 So I can't actually give the shirts (or shorts) out for free, but if you like any of the stuff I am modeling they are available [here](http://store.afa-online.org/home.php) and the money you spend goes to supporting a great animal rights group.

If you're going to any of the US Warped Tour shows they will also be available there. 

















































 As a utilitarian, I am going to say that the action would be justified if the benefit to you exceeds the harm to animals, and if it is the available option that maximizes the benefit and minimizes harm.

I think you would be hard pressed to find many real-world scenarios where raising animals oneself or hunting them in the sense that you are likely imagining would meet those criteria. However, I will say that hunting oysters, which are animals with very limited nervous systems as adults, could very well be justified. 




 You went from a bad justification to a terrible justification. It is not okay to pay people to abuse animals and slaughter them just because you enjoy it. You need to take into account both your enjoyment as well as the harm your actions cause to others in order to make an ethical decision.

The food chain is not an ethical theory (and you won't be any more likely to get eaten by other animals if you choose to eat less meat). 

There is no reason to say reactionary nonsense just because you don't like what /u/The_Same_Sun was saying.

 You're just making things up about animals. Plenty of animals possess very complex minds and social interactions. We have very strong reason to think many of them recognize that they are in captivity and much more.

This year's competition just started today and runs through the end of August. Anyone can join. It is a ton of fun! 




 So if great apes could be taught American sign language, or if parrots had been taught to speak as well as human children, or if dolphins called each other by name and spoke over underwater telephones, or if we had identified words in prairie dog language that communicate shape, size, color, and species of individuals then you would treat them with respect?

At the same time not all humans possess language or higher reason. There are young children, the severely mentally handicapped, the elderly and senile. Should we treat them as property and say their rights end where their owner says so? 




 Humans are animals, and the idea of what ethically relevant criteria should separate humans from non-human animals is one that has been debated for millennia and pushed back time and time again.  




 The Summer Scavenger Hunt is a friendly competition that is now underway and will continue through the end of August. In order to participate just find and document (with pictures or video) items from the list below and then post them to this subreddit to be awarded points.

 You're not less guilty if you pay someone else to do it for you. 




 Do you have just as many roosters as hens? If not, then some birds got ground up. 


































 But we can say things like:

Here are reasons A, B, and C to go vegan. You will be in good company too! Former Vice President Al Gore and Senator Cory Booker are vegan. Google searches for the term vegan have risen sharply in the past few years. Even athletes like 9-time Olympic gold medalist Carl Lewis has adopted a vegan diet. The mainstream is rapidly acknowledging the importance of choosing a compassionate, vegan lifestyle. 




 I'm not suggesting we say, "go vegan because it is normal." That clearly won't work.

I'm suggesting we still use logical arguments to advocate veganism, but also make it more palatable to people by reassuring them that they are making a decision that is normal. 




 The eggs that you eat are not fertilized so there is no need to worry about any baby chickens inside the eggs.

However, there are baby chickens dying in another sense. Male chickens do not lay eggs, and the males of the egg laying variety do not grow fast enough to be worth raising for meat either. These chickens are commonly ground up alive [as can be seen in this short video clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huVJDWaKrxM) or explained in more detail [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN0g13kMk6s). Some other places may simply throw the birds into large trash bags to suffocate.

The hens themselves frequently live in terrible conditions even in facilities that try to advertise themselves as being more humane. [Here are pictures of free-range, cage-free, and organic egg laying operations](http://imgur.com/a/fp7C0). Even on the nicest farms though, the hens' egg production begins to drop off after a couple years of age and they will be sent to slaughter. There is no economic way to let these animals live out their entire lives. [Here is a picture showing how old various animals usually are when slaughtered](http://i.imgur.com/LLyM10R.jpg).

The story for dairy is much the same as with eggs. Cows only give significant amounts of milk for a period of time after birth, so they are repeatedly impregnated to keep up the milk production. The males do not produce milk, so they are separated from their mothers shortly after birth. Cows suffer greatly when separated from their young.

 You're right that whether or not something is seen as normal or weird is not a valid reason to determine whether that behavior is ethical, but these factors do play a role in whether people are willing to seriously consider the idea of veganism.

 [The United States is considering new dietary recommendations along those lines](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/02/19/eating-a-lot-of-meat-is-hurting-the-environment-and-you-should-stop-top-u-s-nutritional-panel-says/). 




 Look at my comment you responded to again. I did not cite Harvard as a source. 




 Yes, I did read the whole thing. Did you read the position paper of the American Dietetic Association yet?

EDIT: Also, how do you think the conclusion "The risks of feeding this excess protein don't seem to apply here" supports your claim that there is "growing evidence that meat is necessary for infant development?" The conclusion as written supports that idea that meat won't necessarily have a negative impact on infant health. 




 That is not a study I referenced. Are you sure this was supposed to be a response to me?

I am citing the position papers that the world's largest dietetic organizations have published on the subject of vegetarian and vegan diets. They have looked through all of the research on the subject to derive their conclusions citing hundreds of pieces of evidence to support their position. A handful of cherry-picked studies cannot refute these position papers. 




 **Objective:** We examined the effect of protein from meat as **complementary foods** on growth and metabolic profiles of breastfed infants.

**Design:** This was a secondary analysis from a trial in which exclusively breastfed infants (56 mo old from the Denver, CO, metro area) were randomly assigned to receive commercially available pureed meats (Meat group; n = 14) or infant cereal (Cereal group; n = 28) as their primary complementary feedings for 5 mo. 

It says there that the pureed meats and infant cereal were complementary to the breast feeding the infants were receiving. Did you read that and think that the mothers were eating pureed meats and infant cereal?

Also, something else you may have missed when you (didn't carefully) read these studies:

**Background:** High intake of cow-milk protein in formula-fed infants is associated with higher weight gain and increased adiposity, which have led to recommendations to limit protein intake in later infancy.

The study is stating that the excess weight and fat that infants gain from consuming dairy formula is a bad thing after the first few months (which is what this study was looking at). 




 [The law prevents much more than just taking samples on private property](http://www.defendingdissent.org/now/news/data-trespass-wyomings-fancy-name-for-ag-gag/). It has essentially stopped the collection of water pollution information in the state. 




 There is not growing evidence. You cited a handful of individual studies that were not looking at vegetarian or vegan diets as a whole.

For example your first study has a sample size of 14 infants fed meat and 28 infants fed cereal. It concluded that their meat diet had more protein than the cereal diet therefore the protein contributed to more growth. If they had fed a higher protein non-meat food, then they would expect the non-meat food to contribute to more growth. 

Compare that to the American Dietetic Association's position paper that cites over 200 studies to support their position. My sources are reputable experts in the dietary field that have conducted reviews of all the literature. It is not some study that you or I are trying to take out of context to support our position. Can you find a similarly reputable organization that has reviewed all of the literature and come to a conclusion that supports your position? 




 A substantial number of animals in slaughterhouses are not stunned properly by the captive bolt guns that are commonly used, and continue down the kill lines fully conscious. 

Many meat eaters also eat Halal or Kosher meats as well as chickens that are killed without any stunning, but simply have their necks slit and are allowed to painfully bleed out while fully conscious. 

Another fairly common technique is controlled atmospheric killing. [Here you can see footage of that process from Australia's largest pig slaughterhouse](https://youtu.be/KArL5YjaL5U?t=1h23m13s).

Speaking hypothetically, if someone kills one animal to send a message, and in turn convinces others to change their behavior enough to save 10 animals from suffering in ways like that shown in the footage above, would you consider their action justified?

Many animal rights groups are working to make cages a little bigger and conditions a little better for animals while people still do eat meat, but ultimately our long term goal should be to move beyond supporting this system of animal mistreatment altogether.  




 The only option available if I want to encourage mainstream companies like Ben and Jerry's to keep making vegan products while still supporting vegan companies is for me to double my consumption of ice cream. 

The sacrifices I make for the animals...

 [More happy chickens](http://i.imgur.com/99X3uRh.gifv) 




 Virtually all hens in commercial egg operationswhether cage or cage-freecome from hatcheries that kill all male chicks shortly after hatching. The males are of no use to the egg industry because they don't lay eggs and aren't bred to grow as large or as rapidly as chickens used in the meat industry. Common methods of killing male chicks include suffocation, gassing and grinding. Hundreds of millions of male chicks are killed at hatcheries each year in the United States. 




 I enjoyed the taste of meat, but I wasn't okay with the things that were being done to animals in order for traditional meats to be produced. Things that taste like meat, but don't cause harm to animals are a win-win! 




 Yeah, I downvote this. 




 Like I said, I post things that I enjoy and that I think other people will also enjoy. There's nothing sinister to my motives. 




 What was the title of this post?  




 How would you phrase it if you wanted to make clear that eating animals was not acceptable while not having people on the internet perceive your attitude as "holier than thou"? 




 The majority of your submissions appear to be combat scenes. The majority of my submissions are about animals or animal rights. We both post about what interests us. You keep your gruesome military footage in /r/combatscenes where it belongs, and I submit cute animal gifs to /r/aww where it also belongs.  




 I literally spend 8 hours per day working. I also have been spending a lot of my free time running /r/SummerScavengerHunt lately. In my remaining time I submit content that I have enjoyed and that I think other redditors will enjoy too. Judging by the response to my submissions I have done a pretty good job of this.

Sorry if some of my submissions have offended you, but I'm not going to stop contributing just because a small number of people dislike my submissions. 




 There is wide consensus among dietary experts that appropriately planned vegetarian and vegan diets are healthy for all stages of life. If we can live happy, healthy lives while causing less harm to animals, why wouldn't we? 




 Never! 




 Can't go wrong emulating the behaviors of our ancestors. /sarcasm 




 I'm assuming that /u/Bhadoom was referring to the cow. I'm pretty sure she is vegetarian, although I'm not so sure about the Greenpeace bit. 




 Most of us would stop to help a bird with a broken wing who was suffering on our front lawn, but many of us pay companies for products knowing that a great deal of suffering is caused to animals in the process. We know that chickens suffering in factory farms and slaughterhouses suffer much like the bird on your front lawn, so why should there be this disconnect in our actions? 















































































  In fact, the animals in farms get to LIVE LONGER than they would in the wild

[No, no, no](http://i.imgur.com/LLyM10R.jpg)

Here's what I propose: Start treating other animals like individuals whose lives have value of their own, independent of what they can provide to you. 




 And no dairy or egg farm is keeping animals alive for their full life span anyway. Once their production begins to drop the dairy cows and egg laying hens are inevitably sent to slaughter. 




 Do you have a peer reviewed journal article where dogs were assigned to groups that were fed either an appropriately planned vegan diet or a standard diet, and then the long term health outcomes of both groups were monitored?

If not, then how about accepting what the best evidence currently available suggests. 




 [ChooseVeg.com](http://www.chooseveg.com/) and /r/vegan are good places to start.

 Richard Dawkins has a great essay titled [Gaps in the Mind](http://www.animal-rights-library.com/texts-m/dawkins01.htm), which discusses the flaws behind this sort of "every human before any  non-human animals" reasoning. 




 Those militants on the internet are asking questions that I don't want to answer! They are literally ISIS!! 




 I wouldn't date someone who wasn't vegan. 



























































 Almost any food with protein will have all 9 essential amino acids. 




 The animals being raised for food suffer immensely, and there are far more of them suffering and dying each year than there are dogs and cats that we care for. If you care about animals it only makes sense to address the area where the vast majority of animals are suffering.

If you don't think you can go 100% vegetarian right away then you can still cut out most of the meat you are eating from your diet. Tell your parents that you would like to avoid meat, and they will likely be more accommodating too. Even when you are eating out or with friends you will be surprised by how often you can find meat-free options if you look for them. You can easily have a huge impact in lessening animal suffering with only a minor effort to choose more animal-friendly options.

Finally, keep in mind that you can stop eating meat, and don't hesitate to go fully vegetarian when you are ready. You may find that many of your peers are already doing it! 








































































































 Ultimately ethical veganism is a boycott intended to lessen the demand for animal products. Other animals do not possess all of the capacities that a typical human would have, but they show responses that appear quite similar to our own reactions to suffering when treated in many of the ways that would cause us to suffer.

[Utilitarianism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism) is a common school of ethical thought amongst vegans. Utilitarians view an action as good if it maximizes the amount of goodness (generally judged as increasing pleasure or happiness, and minimizing pain or suffering) that is expected to occur as a result. While many ethical vegans will openly admit that they enjoy the taste of meat (evidenced by the numerous meat alternatives available for vegans today), they recognize that the harm caused to other animals to produce these products almost certainly exceeds the pleasure they gain as a result. The boycott that is veganism lessens demand for these products, and correspondingly supply will decrease as a result.

Another way of expressing this is in the principle of [equal consideration of interests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_consideration_of_interests). That is to say that the interest of any individual should be given equal consideration where, and to the extent that the interest exists. This isn't to say that all interests are equal, experienced equally, or that all animals possess interests, but that where there are interests, we should weight that interest proportionally to the intensity of the interest and not discriminate on any other basis. 




 You vegans are so extreme! :P 
























 Go on. I want to hear more of this story. 



















 Vegans don't care what you eat. They care who you eat. 

Other animals are individuals with lives and desires of their own that ought to be respected. A vegan is only going to speak up to the extent that someone's actions are violating another individual's rights. This meme clearly demonstrates a gross misunderstanding of the issue at hand. 






































































































































 I use /r/friends to keep track of what redditors I like have posted without having to look at all of their profiles individually. 




 Isn't it amazing how these things find their way into vegan neighborhoods just by complete coincidence? ;) 









 Cruelty is cruelty, and suffering is suffering. Everything else is arbitrary. 




 In the Matrix humans were bred for the purpose of being used to generate energy for machines. Did that make it okay for humans to be used in this way? Did these humans lose all rights solely because they were bred for a purpose?

Just how destructive does a culinary preference have to be before we decide to eat something else? If contributing to the suffering of billions of animals that live miserable lives and (quite often) die in horrific ways isn't motivating, what would be? If being the number one contributor to the most serious threat facing the planet (global warming) isn't enough, what is? And if you are tempted to put off these questions of conscience, to say not now, then when?

 Just want to throw in my vote for /u/justin_timeforcake. I have seen the great job they do on some of the other subreddits they moderate. /u/justin_timeforcake is an active part of /r/vegan and participates in vegan discussions across reddit. I think they would be a wonderful addition as a moderator for our subreddit. 




 Hey infinity! 

I have noticed a lot of people referencing your username instead of mine. I do try to clarify, but getting the message out to everyone is near impossible. I hope you've been enjoying some of the nice things people have been saying about you, even if it is by accident.

-test_subject7471 




 Nothing I do is all that hard. Everyone here could be doing exactly what I do. There are plenty of other redditors that have more karma than I do (for now).

As far as tools go, I use a tool called [Reddit Scheduler](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/reddit-scheduler/ekdpobinhbpdigokooncmmmamhmjfigl?hl=en) to get links to post at the times I want them to. It gets the job done 80% of the time, but 20% it will mess something up and not post anything else until I uninstall and reinstall it. It is also generally inconvenient to use, but it is the only thing I have found for making a lot of posts to reddit at the times I want. It would save me some trouble if someone made something better.

I also use [Reddit Later](http://www.redditlater.com/analysis/) to tell me when the best times to submit to a subreddit is. Unfortunately it just looks at when the most popular posts were submitted, which is a bit different from what time I should submit a link to get the most karma. It also tends to have a small sample size for a lot of subreddit since it only looks at posts since the first of the month. Improving upon this tool would also help. 




 Thank you all so much for all the kind words. This has made me so happy. 

I'm actually taking a bit of a break from reddit for the next 10 days to do some real world activism, so I won't be on much. I hope you all cover for me in my absence.  








































































































 Every major dietetic organization in the world goes out of their way to publish statements that "appropriately planned vegan diets are healthy for all stages of life. Any diet needs to be planned appropriately in order to be healthy. Yours is no exception, yet somehow you think that no matter how you slice it vegan diets are unhealthy. That takes some serious delusion.
 




 You are benefiting right now from iodized salt, enriched flour, fortified breakfast cereals. It is widely recommended that any women who could become pregnant take a folic acid supplement. We are all living longer and healthier thanks to fortified and supplemented foods. 




 /u/Zhaey provided links to statements from all of the world's most prominent dietary organizations to back up his position. What evidence supports your claim? 




 Why does it matter what humans did historically or if humans are classified as omnivores if vegan diets are just as healthy? 




 **[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**

 It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

**[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**

 A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.

**[The British National Health Service](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx)**

 With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.

**[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**

 A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

 Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**

 Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

**[The Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446)**

  A well-planned vegetarian diet (*see context*) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can provide all the nutrients you need at any age, as well as some additional health benefits. 




 The majority of soy and corn being grown today is fed to livestock. You can't get more calories out of a slaughtered animal than you fed to it originally. If we stopped raising livestock and ate the plant food that we are already growing we would have more than enough food to feed everyone in the world (although we would probably grow less corn and soy and more of other crops). 




 But clearly the abundance of vegetarians that are happily thriving throughout the world is evidence that killing animals for food is needless. 




 You would certainly hope so if he is making statements like this. 




 The pope PMed me and admitted that he was telling millions of Catholics to vote brigade by downvoting non-Christian content. [Here is 10 hours of our conversation as proof](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taO0TOwSF3U). The mods of /r/vegancirclejerk need to ban the pope. 




 Wouldn't it be even worse if the dogs had suffered their entire lives in conditions that livestock typically endure?

I know that we are used to livestock being raised this way and so we are predisposed to minimize how bad it could be, but any way I try to think about it the animals being raised as livestock almost certainly suffer more. 





































































 I just looked up Miller, Budweiser, and Pabst. The large majority of all of their beers are vegan. 

Also Fanta does not include any fish... Where are you getting these ideas?

 It is also not uncommon for humans to die in construction. Many more humans die from pollution created by the electricity you use.

I think you would still state that you believe that humans shouldn't be murdered for profit despite the fact that you are using electricity. 












































 Full Quote:

Hold then the same view of the dog which has lost his master, which has sought him in all the thoroughfares with cries of sorrow, which comes into the house troubled and restless, goes downstairs, goes upstairs; goes from room to room, finds at last in his study the master he loves, and betokens his gladness by soft whimpers, frisks, and caresses. 

There are barbarians who seize this dog, who so greatly surpasses man in fidelity and friendship, and nail him down to a table and dissect him alive, to show you the Mesaraic veins! You discover in him all the same organs of feeling as in yourself. Answer me, Mechanist, has Nature arranged all the springs of feeling in this animal to the end that he might not feel? Has he nerves that he may be incapable of suffering? Do not suppose that impertinent contradiction in Nature.

-Voltaire, *Dictionnaire philosophique portatif* (1764)

Explanation: In the 17th Century, Ren Descartes had advocated the idea that animals were mere automatons, or complex machines, and that lacking a soul they could not suffer. Followers of Descartes ideas, who Voltaire and others referred to as Mechanists, conducted gruesome experiments on animals with little consideration for the unimaginable misery the animals were forced to endure. The quote above was Voltaires response to those who were conducting these experiments with no consideration for the well-being of the animals involved. 

















































 The issue isn't what they are being fed. The issue is that you will always need to feed an animal more nutrients than you can possibly get back from the animal's corpse.

If you want to be able to feed a large human population as you indicated in your prior comment then the way to do that is by having people consume plants directly instead of feeding plants to other animals and then consuming the animals. 




 There have been many times when scientific ideas have been censored in a similar fashion because people didn't like the conclusions. Far too many people today view philosophy as mere opinions, but whether they like it or not there are factual statements that can be made about individual wellbeing and the consequences our actions have upon others. Not everyone will agree with Singer's views, but he at least makes a good attempt to back up his views with solidly supported evdence on what the consequences of our actions will be, and is open to being shown that he is wrong if better evidence suggests otherwise. Censoring a world-renowned philosopher like Singer is a disappointing short term setback for philosophy, but as we have seen with controversial science, even with strong opposition accurate ideas win out in the end. 




 We could feed far more people than there are currently on earth if we weren't feeding so much corn and soy to farmed animals.  




 I'm a neurologist. QED 




 Do you also hate white people because they have a habit of blowing up the Oklahoma City Federal Building?

Don't hate a group of millions of  people because of something a handful of individuals may have ever done. 




 Have you heard how they talk about [black sheep](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_sheep)? 




 Proof: There is a guy with flair on /r/science 




 Undercover investigators with several different groups have gotten jobs at dozens of randomly selected farms and slaughterhouses within the past couple years. Every single time they come back with video showing horrifying conditions and terrible mistreatment. Even the industry acknowledges that mutilations like dehorning, debeaking, tail docking, and castration all without anesthesia are common. We know that many animals are kept in battery cages and gestation crates and those that aren't are rarely afforded much more space. Nobody should be able to buy these products anymore without acknowledging that they are paying to support animal cruelty. 




 Go gather the evidence and get it published in a peer reviewed journal then. Science isn't done by repeating "I'm a neurologist" on the internet, and you should know that.

There are a few other reactions in there that could be turned into gifs. 









 You are being downvoted because you have attempted to dismiss everyone who rightly objects to the abhorrent cruelty that pigs are commonly subjected to on contemporary farms by referring to those people as juvenile and attacking their character despite a complete lack of evidence on your part. At the same time you have failed to present any rational justification for your pro-cruelty stance.

There is no brigade, it is just a bad comment. 




 Instead of resorting to insults you could articulate why you feel your justification was valid. 




 The train of thought is bad regardless of where it is used. That includes the food question. 




 Several of the above quotes specifically mention vegan diets as being healthy for all stages of life, and the rest say "(*see context*)" suggesting that you should actually go look at the context for the quote, in which case you would see that the sources are including vegan diets as a type of vegetarian diet in their statements. 

These are the largest groups of dietary experts in the world. Some blog source that you saw once on Google of a guy saying he is a recovering vegetarian does not refute that.

Interestingly, what you are doing (rejecting scientific evidence and suggesting that people turn to inferior and unsupported sources) is also a popular strategy used by creationists.

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

 Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**

 Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

**[The Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446)**

  A well-planned vegetarian diet (*see context*) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.

**[The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada](http://www.heartandstroke.com/site/c.ikIQLcMWJtE/b.3484249/k.2F6C/Healthy_living__Vegetarian_diets.htm)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can provide all the nutrients you need at any age, as well as some additional health benefits. 




 Does [Mercy for Animals](https://www.youtube.com/user/mercyforanimals/videos) count? 




 It is because there is no singular for the word "cattle" so often the word "cow" is casually used to describe the species even though properly it only refers to females of the species. 




 I bet you also think killing humans is wrong. Why are you using electricity since air pollution kills people? And what if that paper clip you just dropped causes a hurricane to develop on the other side of the globe that kills people? You should also try talking to mountains about not crushing people in avalanches because that is wrong.

Or you could be a reasonable individual who does what is possible and practical to minimize their impact on others (human and non-human), and recognizes the fact that even though we can't do everything that shouldn't stop us from doing what we can do. 









 The top response would be:

Found the vegan! 




 No, you shouldn't forgo evidence because a child says something that contradicts it, but we can recognize that children may not yet have many of our prejudices and can lend a unique way of looking at things. 

That is what this post is intended to convey, not that children are actually infallible.  




 I predict that /u/russlemahjunk is going to suddenly care a lot less about plants than they did a few minutes ago. 




 Are you familiar with the "Hokey Pokey"? I believe it ranks up with the work of Harris and Dawkins as one of the greatest philosophical pieces of all time. 




 You did a far better job articulting counter arguments than the actual troll. Can we hire you as full-time troll for this sub? How do you feel about being a neurologist who herds sheep? 




 At least they figured out to make a new username this time. 














 Did you read the article?

Of course, I don't really believe eating meat (or not) has anything to do with masculinity. Gender rules are as limiting for society as national and racial stereotypes. The long term goal is surely to remove attachment to masculinity altogether.

 I'm sure they eat and enjoy protein-rich vegan foods all the time without even consciously realizing that what they are eating is vegan.  




 [Here's an essay discussing whether or not we ought to eat insects with the goal of reducing suffering in mind](http://reducing-suffering.org/why-i-dont-support-eating-insects/) 




 don't tell me ~~what~~ **who** I can and can't eat.

Animals are individuals. They are not merely things. 




 I think we are 30 years away from some major countries such as the US going vegan. We are probably still 70 years away from the majority of the world going vegan.

Google searches for vegan have increased by a factor of 2.5 in the past 5 years and /r/vegan subscribers are growing by about 0.1% per day. If either of these trends continue we are about 30 years away from a vegan world. 



















 [Here is Google Trends search info for the keyword "vegan" from the past 90 days](https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=vegan geo=US date=today%203-m cmpt=q tz=Etc%2FGMT%2B4).

There is a peak every Sunday, except for one unusual peak on Tuesday, June 9th. [Here are the Google News results for the keyword "vegan" from that day](https://www.google.com/search?q=vegan es_sm=93 biw=1920 bih=971 source=lnt tbs=cdr%3A1%2Ccd_min%3A6%2F9%2F2015%2Ccd_max%3A6%2F9%2F2015 tbm=nws).

All of the top news results are about Beyonce being *vegan*. I'm not sure what sort of impact this really has, but it attracted a lot of extra attention to veganism and I found it interesting. 
























 I don't approve of people consuming dairy and eggs either. The way animals are treated in order to produce these products is unacceptable.

Even if people don't like hearing this, that is a much smaller concern than the need for this message to be heard.

 This isn't in my part of the world, but one group that I follow is [Sentience Politics](https://www.facebook.com/SentiencePolitics?fref=ts) 









 Male chickens do not lay eggs, and the males of the egg laying variety do not grow fast enough to be worth raising for meat either. These chickens are commonly ground up alive [as can be seen in this short video clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huVJDWaKrxM) or explained in more detail [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN0g13kMk6s). Some other places may simply throw the birds into large trash bags to suffocate.

The hens themselves frequently live in terrible conditions even in facilities that try to advertise themselves as being more humane. [Here are pictures of free-range, cage-free, and organic egg laying operations](http://imgur.com/a/fp7C0). Even on the nicest farms though, the hens' egg production begins to drop off after a couple years of age and they will be sent to slaughter. There is no economic way to let these animals live out their entire lives. [Here is a picture showing how old various animals usually are when slaughtered](http://i.imgur.com/LLyM10R.jpg).

**Ingredients**

* 2 garlic heads/bulbs, top quarter cut off to expose cloves
* 6 tbsp + 1 tsp olive oil
* pinch of fresh thyme leaves (optional)
* 1 head cauliflower (2 pounds)
* salt + pepper
* 2 tbsp lemon juice, plus extra
* 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes, or to taste
* 1 pound brown rice pasta, such as penne or fusilli 
* 2-3 handfuls baby arugula
* 1/4 cup walnut halves, toasted + chopped

**Directions** 

Adjust an oven rack to the middle position, place a naked baking sheet on the rack and preheat to 500 degrees F. Tear two squares of aluminum foil and place cut garlic heads in the centers. Drizzle exposed garlic tops with 1/2 tsp olive oil each. Season with salt, pepper, and thyme leaves (if using). Wrap garlic bulbs up securely and place in the oven. Roast until garlic is browned and mushy/tender, about 40 minutes.

While garlic is roasting, trim the cauliflower leaves and the extra bit of stalk at the bottom. Cut the head right down the middle, from top to bottom. From there, cut each half into 4 wedges. In a medium bowl, toss the cauliflower wedges with 2 tablespoons olive oil, salt, and pepper. Remove the pre-heated baking sheet from the oven and carefully lay the cauliflower wedges onto the surface, leaving some space around each piece. You should hear sizzling. Roast cauliflower until tender and well-browned, about 25 minutes (I flipped mine halfway).

Once slightly cooled, transfer cauliflower to a cutting board and cut into bite-size pieces. Unwrap roasted garlic and squeeze cloves out into a small bowl. Mash roasted garlic with a fork to make a smooth puree. Whisk in the lemon juice, pepper flakes, some salt + pepper, and 1/4 cup of olive oil. Set aside.

Cook brown rice pasta according to package directions with a fat pinch of salt in the water. Reserve 1 cup of pasta cooking water before draining. Once drained, return cooked pasta to the pot. Add chopped cauliflower, garlic sauce, arugula, extra lemon juice to taste, and 1/4 cup reserved cooking water. Add more cooking water as necessary to achieve desired consistency. Serve pasta with handfuls of chopped walnuts on top and extra chili flakes.

 Classification of specific foods as good or bad is overly simplistic and can foster unhealthy eating behaviors.

 OKCupid lets you search by diet (including vegan) for free! 




 My favorite restaurants in the area that meet your criteria are Cha-Ya and Herbivore. 




 There are a bunch of other vegan bands doing the Warped Tour too. I had trouble keeping track of all of them. I met Silverstein back in 2013 when they did a signing at our table. I got to talk to a lot of band members who were vegan this time around, but I didn't keep close track of what bands they were with. 




 Is your point that when people act in ways that harm others they may be criticized for it? 














 I don't think I have any innate gifts for activism. I think I have succeeded and improved because I have sought out information on how to be an effective activist, and I have practiced regularly and tried lots of different things.

 I very much prefer my bed at home. Sleeping somewhere that is 90 degrees, not filled with the sounds of rattling and clanking metal, and where I don't bounce up and down from the potholes in the road seems better to me for some strange reason. 




 Some of my least favorite experiences aren't with people trying to be rude, but people who feel hot and decide that it is okay to sit down right next to or even in front of our tables to get shade. I hate having to shoo these people away and seem like the mean vegan even though it clearly isn't appropriate to just plop themselves down directly in front of our tables.

Along those lines there were some girls at the Houston, Texas show who had brought hula hoops to the event and were doing some artistic/acrobatic hula hoop twirling that for some reason they decided to do right next to our tables. After a couple minutes of this, we pointed out to them that people couldn't come up to the table because they didn't want to interfere with their hula hooping and we asked them to choose another spot for what they were doing. 

One of the girls flipped out at this, she walked about 20 feet away, but then turned back and started shouting things like "Hey, I don't see anyone at your table! Nobody wants to go up to you guys anyway!" We mostly ignored her and after a couple minutes she left, but came back later in the day to complain a bit more. It was one of the most immature things I had ever seen. 




 I first got interest in my club by putting up fliers that had little pull off tabs with my contact info around campus. The school also had a club day where students would go around to tables to find out about on campus clubs. I had a sign up sheet for people to provide us with their e-mail addresses and that's where most interested people signed up.

The core people involved in my club were interested in spreading animal rights, but many more people were only interested in tasty vegan food. I'm not a great cook, but I hosted a lot of vegan potlucks as club events. 

My club also did a lot of tabling on campus. I had inherited a lot of stickers that were printed by PETA from a previous animal rights group on campus that had died out a couple years before I started mine. I was also able to make pins/buttons for free using a button maker that the campus had, so we passed these things out for free. If you can't figure out how to get anything like this to pass out for free, you can print stickers super cheap [here](http://www.printrunner.com/cut-to-size-sticker-printing.html) as long as you are printing a large quantity. Passing out a free sticker with a piece of literature can help you reach more people, and anything that you offer for free can bring a lot more people up to your table for a conversation.

Planning a trip to an animal sanctuary, inviting club members to join you for leafleting, holding a movie screening, and [doing a vegan food sampling](http://www.vegfund.org/food-sampling-intro.html) are other good events for on-campus clubs. Assume at first that you will need to be the one taking the initiative to plan these things, but hopefully after a few events you will empower more people to feel comfortable taking the reins on their own. 




 Thank you! 




 I think the easiest and one of the more effective ways to engage in activism is leafleting. You can very easily get booklets from [Vegan Outreach](http://veganoutreach.org/order-form/) or [Mercy For Animals](http://store.mercyforanimals.org/details.php?productId=41) that you can pass out at a college campus or local event (I have leafleted at concerts, farmers markets, and a Fourth of July parade). 

Other options include getting involved with the [10 Billion Lives Tour](http://www.10billiontour.org/volunteer) or [writing letters to the editor for a local paper](http://www.mercyforanimals.org/action-center#letters). While there are some opportunities to volunteer with larger groups such as [The Humane League](http://www.thehumaneleague.com/get-involved/) I think our movement could really benefit from more people taking the initiative to go out and get involved in something they plan on their own even if it is as simple as leafleting a local college campus. 

Finally, don't hesitate to use the internet as a way to reach a lot of people. Online activism, to the extent that it successfully reaches people is just as valuable as similarly effective real-world activism. 




 Yeah, you were the guy I remembered. It was really nice getting to meet you! 




 I remember a guy who asked me and one of the daily volunteers what our favorite stickers were who was at the table for a while. There were also a couple other people who took a while to pick out stickers, but I would need to see a picture to remind me of what they looked like. 




 I don't get paid for any of my activism. I have a full time job working for a company that administers health insurance and pension plans. I'm responsible for reviewing the agreements that come in and setting up our computer system to handle as much of administering the benefits as possible. I also manage a small group of people doing similar work, and I do a lot of work manipulating large amounts of data using Excel (I'm very good at programming Macros in VBA, so the company relies upon me for that).

I know it seems like a lot, but I still have time for normal hobbies too. I play on a soccer team, run/compete in /r/SummerScavengerHunt, and I go hiking most weekends. The nice thing about posting things on reddit is that I can do it while lying on the couch watching Netflix after work. 




 Yeah, I was at the San Antonio show. Did you see me there? 

[This is me](http://i.imgur.com/yeY1gtJ.jpg) 




 I hadn't seen that picture yet, but I do see a bit of myself hidden in the background there. 

The issue of swallowing is a very controversial vegan matter. Personally, I prefer to just let foods gradually slide down my throat instead of swallowing them. :P

As far as activism goes, I think we should try to engage in some activism that pushes us outside of our normal comfort zone. In one of my other comments I described one of our volunteers who was incredibly reluctant to leaflet at first, but after seeing me do it and slowly wading into it herself, she was able to pass out quite a few leaflets. 

There are lots of other things that people can do without having to talk to many people face to face though. Action For Animals puts out a lot of their literature in vegan/vegetarian friendly restaurants, and they are often looking for people who will help deliver this literature to local restaurants. Mercy for Animals also recommends writing letters to the editor as something that people can do. [Here is their guide on how to do it](http://www.mercyforanimals.org/action-center#letters). Another thing we can all do is engage in online activism by submitting content to Facebook or reddit, or commenting on reddit threads discussing animal issues.  




 The admins haven't ever submitted content to /r/vegancirclejerk! Why aren't the admins providing us with more assistance? Firing Victoria is clearly the straw that broke the camel's back, and that doesn't sound very vegan.

If /r/vegancirclejerk goes dark then those admins will finally have to pay attention to us! 




 I have been using test_subject7471 (with an L) since long before I started using reddit. Back in the late 1990s/early 2000s I was using AIM (AOL instant messenger) quite a bit, and I created several alt usernames for myself on there. One of them included Infinity as part of the username. Over the next couple years I started using similar usernames for other sites and it eventually morphed into the current version. There isn't any particular deeper meaning I have associated with it, it is just the handle I have become accustomed to using on the internet. 

If you do a Google search for test_subject7471, only about 20% if the profiles that come up are mine though. 




 I think /u/squeek502's answer is probably more reassuring than anything I can say. He came out to one of the shows and helped out all day. We distributed a record amount of literature that day (more than Action For Animals had ever gotten out at any single event in the past). 

In my experience people are much more receptive to leaflets than anyone would expect. When you walk up to people 65% will take a leaflet and say "thank you", 33% will politely turn you down, 1% will say "I like meat", and 1% will be curious and will ask a couple more questions about the information you're distributing.

I have passed out about 50,000 leaflets throughout all of my activism. Never have I had anyone attack me personally, and for every discouraging comment I have had many more positive ones. My experiences with outreach have always been rewarding overall and left me feeling very good at the end of the day. 




 test_subject7471 (my username starts with a lower case L). There is another user with the username infinity who I think is starting to get tired of all the username mentions they get that are intended for me. 




 [I also see comments like these](https://np.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/3aj2ex/i_just_wanted_to_remind_utest_subject7471_how_much_we/) and it makes me never want to stop. 

It is a bit tough when people are degrading or when people simply don't seem to get the point despite all my best efforts, but I try not to take it too personally when people are rude on the internet. Overall, my experiences with animal rights activism have been much more positive than negative. 




 People were very receptive everywhere we went. I do notice small differences between shows. The people attending the show in Oklahoma City tended to be notably heavier than people in other cities, and Houston had the most people who said "I like meat" and walked off when offered some information. The biggest difference was how hot and humid it got after we left California. Mesa, Arizona was 114 degrees while we were there and Texas and Oklahoma shows were near 100 degrees with very high humidity. It made keeping our energy up a lot harder, but I still did my best to put on a big smile and shout at every kid walking by our table (it is very loud so shouting is the only way to be heard). 

Overall though, everywhere we go people tend to be supportive and receptive, and the large majority of our conversations are positive. 




 I am very much an introvert myself. I would normally avoid big concerts like this because I generally don't enjoy things with large groups of people. That said, I have largely overcome my shyness that I had before going vegan, so I can confidently approach people and start a conversation, even if I wouldn't go to these events for fun.

One of our daily volunteers was terrified of leafleting at first. I asked her to at least come out with me to leaflet the line. At first she hid behind a tree and watched me handing leaflets to people. Then I talked her into stepping out a bit more, and finally got her to hold some leaflets and offer them to the people next to the people I had already approached and handed leaflets to. Within an hour or so she was walking up to people more or less on her own and handing them leaflets. 

[Vegan Outreach](http://veganoutreach.org/contact/) does a lot of leafleting at events and college campuses. If you contact them, they will be happy to let you know when an experienced leafleter will be in your area and how you can get involved with helping them. 

[Mercy for Animals](http://www.mercyforanimals.org/get-involved) has several ideas for ways people can get involved on their website. Another easy way to get involved is with [FARM's 10 Billion Lives Tour](http://www.10billiontour.org/volunteer) (paying people to watch a 4 minute video on factory farming). 

In addition to real world activism, we can all share things online that can reach huge numbers of people with a pro-animal rights message. [Here is a resource where you can quickly see where people are mentioning the word "vegan" on reddit](http://metareddit.com/monitor/PGfXV/vegan/). You can also find content that helps promote animal rights and help submit it to other subreddits. 




 You are correct. I spent 5 weeks volunteering at Warped Tour a couple years ago, and I have passed out 20,000 booklets with Vegan Outreach too. My first activism experiences were back when I was running an animal rights club in college. 




 I see an important role for both within the animal rights movement. People are more charitable when talking to someone face to face that they can see and identify with. We can pick up on social cues that may not be available online and better tailor our responses to people.

Online we have the advantage of being able to cite sources, and have our comments or posts seen by a much wider audience. [Here is a link that I posted the day I left on my trip](http://imgur.com/nsFUwJ1). It has been viewed 3.1 million times. I could never reach that many people in person, but online I have been able to post share several items a month that get over a million views. These images can't replace a full conversation with someone, but they have absolutely succeeded in starting many conversations and giving many people a slight nudge in the direction of veganism. 

If I was choosing which area I think we can make a larger impact with the same amount of effort, I would say online activism, if done well, is a better use of most people's efforts at this time. 




 A lot of people came up to the table saying they were interested in going vegan and asked us for tips on how to do that. So, by being there I think there is a good chance that we got them to take the final leap, but I hardly count that as a conversion. 

When we got people to approach the table I would generally start by asking them if they were vegan, vegetarian, or just interested (I phrased it this way because it seems like I am giving them a choice, but no matter what they answer it sounds like they are on the side of cutting back on animal products). If people said "just interested" I would encourage them to give up more animal products and consider going vegetarian. If they said they were vegetarian then I would push them toward veganism by saying something like.

Have you ever considered moving toward veganism? I'm sure you're aware that the conditions for egg laying hens and dairy cows are every bit as terrible as for animals raised for meat. I totally get that going vegan can seem daunting, I was very hesitant myself to make the switch at first. It means cutting out all these foods from your diet, and you don't know what is going to replace them yet. I've been vegan for seven years and now I just go to the supermarket like anyone else and pick up the foods I like, as anyone else would, but when I was first making the change it was definitely more difficult. 

One thing we recommend to people is to consider committing to cutting out all animal products from your diet 1-2 days a week. That way you can start finding new foods and alternatives that you enjoy and from there it becomes much easier to do 3,4,5 days a week after that!

The conversation varied a bit from person to person (they would usually give some of their own feedback in between my comments). I think the approach I used was very effective (I could tell people responded very positively to it), but because I didn't ever say to go outright vegan right away I didn't hear many people say they were going to do that.  




 It isn't PETA that you are harming. It is the birds who are being harmed. 




 [Here are some pictures showing what our outreach looked like at a typical show](http://imgur.com/a/Cqay4). We also leafleted the line every morning before each show. On a typical day we distributed 3,000-5,000 pieces of literature, engaged in a couple hundred conversations, and raised between $800 and $2,000 for the non-profit Action for Animals. Several other redditors came for a day to help volunteer with us (I'll let them decide if they want to expose themselves). I had a lot of people tell me that they went vegetarian or vegan from something they had heard/read/seen at a prior year's Warped Tour show. 

One thing I noticed is that for many of our volunteers this was their first time engaging in any activism. They all did a great job, and their talents, if applied effectively, could spare the lives of hundreds of thousands even millions of animals. If you have any questions about getting involved in animal rights activism, please ask!

I'm happy to answer any other questions you have too. AMA! 






































































































































 One of the top redditors (1,000,000 karma) who mods some of the default subs said this in /r/centuryclub:

We don't know the details of her removal, and frankly, shouldn't. Encouraging tamper tantrums by blacking out subreddits is tantamount to the tamper tantrum the users threw when FPH occurred. 

/u/chooter was incredible in every instance of my interactions with her, but that still doesn't mean I should know why she was let go from her position or that I should make a hissy fit about something I don't know anything about.

I do believe the reddit staff handled the timing poorly, but that doesn't change the sentiment in any way.

Reddit is a community that we all enjoy. By tanking this site we are also losing out.

The people who run reddit (admins) do have some responsibilities to the community, but reddit is a site designed to make it up to us as users to provide the content that we enjoy, independent of assistance from the admins. 

I can see the value in some protest to voice the concerns of the community, but by now those concerns have been heard. The admins undoubtedly think this is very serious. It is time to open up subreddits again so that the protest doesn't unnecessarily continue to inconvenience us (the users). 









 We all lose out on this community that we enjoy. 




 Ultimately ethical veganism is a boycott intended to lessen the demand for animal products. Other animals do not possess all of the capacities that a typical human would have, but they show responses that appear quite similar to our own reactions to suffering when treated in many of the ways that would cause us to suffer.

[Utilitarianism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism) is a common school of ethical thought amongst vegans. Utilitarians view an action as good if it maximizes the amount of goodness (generally judged as increasing pleasure or happiness, and minimizing pain or suffering) that is expected to occur as a result. While many ethical vegans will openly admit that they enjoy the taste of meat (evidenced by the numerous meat alternatives available for vegans today), they recognize that the harm caused to other animals to produce these products almost certainly exceeds the pleasure they gain as a result. The boycott that is veganism lessens demand for these products, and correspondingly supply will decrease as a result.

Another way of expressing this is in the principle of [equal consideration of interests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_consideration_of_interests). That is to say that the interest of any individual should be given equal consideration where, and to the extent that the interest exists. This isn't to say that all interests are equal, experienced equally, or that all animals possess interests, but that where there are interests, we should weight that interest proportionally to the intensity of the interest and not discriminate on any other basis.

 There are people starving in Africa! Lets feed perfectly good food to animals and then slaughter the animals so that we can get back only a small fraction of the food. That will show those starving people how much we care! 




 Okay, so supposing that is true we ought to take the suffering of plants into consideration as well when deciding how we ought to behave. 

Which do you think causes less plant suffering: Feeding plants to animals then eating animals or consuming plants directly? 




 One thing I have been pondering doing is getting a bunch of vegan cookies then going to a college campus and offering them as free samples. However, I would put them out on two plates titled "regular chocolate chip cookies" and "vegan chocolate chip cookies". 

I would set up cameras to record the whole thing and tell people that I'm hoping to get feedback on the recipes and ask them what they thought about both. I think people's reactions would make for an interesting video.

**Ingredients**

* 1 can chickpeas, reserving a small handful for the avocado cream (you can cook dried ones as well)
* 3 cloves garlic
* 1 small onion
* 2 teaspoons ground cumin
* A BIG bunch of both fresh parsley and coriander
* Salt and pepper
* 2 Tablespoons olive oil
* 3/4 cup chickpea flour (sometimes called gram flour)
* Burger buns and fresh tomato for serving

**For the avocado cream and tahini mayo**

* 1 avocado
* A small handful chickpeas left from can
* A bunch of fresh parsley
* 1 garlic clove
* 2 tablespoons tahini
* The juice of one lemon
* 2 tablespoons water

**Directions**

Throw your chickpeas, peeled garlic, onion, cumin and salt and pepper into a food processor and pulse until roughly blended. Youll need to scrape down the sides. Now add in the fresh herbs, oil and flour and blend until you have a nice thick texture, but it will still be fairly moist. Place into a bowl and if you need, add a little more flour to help the mixture bind as you form them into the patties. Make them small or big as you prefer. In a flat frying pan, heat about half an inch of oil over medium to high and add in your burgers. Cook for about 4 -5 minutes on both sides and once they are on their second turn, press them gently to make them flatter if you need. They should turn a nice dark, golden brown and smell divine!

For the avocado cream, simply add to your processor the avocado (without skin of course!), the remaining chickpeas, parsley and 1 garlic clove and blend until smooth. For the tahini mayo, drop the two tablespoons of tahini into a small bowl with the lemon juice and water and whisk with folk until you have a creamy consistency.

Toast the bun, add the burger, then the avocado, then a slice of tomato and finish with the oozy, lovely tahini mayo!

 I think we need to hold a vote. All those in favor of swallows being vegan upvote this comment. 




 Good news! You actually don't need any nutrients from meat! You can live a happy and healthy life as a vegetarian!

According to the [American Dietetic Association](http://www.eatright.org/WorkArea//DownloadAsset.aspx?id=8417):

It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

Similarly, the [British Dietetic Association](https://www.bda.uk.com/foodfacts/vegetarianfoodfacts) describes veganism as a type of vegetarian diet and continues:

Well planned vegetarian diets can be both nutritious and healthy. They have been associated with lower risks of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity, certain types of cancer and lower blood cholesterol levels.

Well planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for all stages of life.

The position of the Australian Government's [National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55_australian_dietary_guidelines_130530.pdf) is that:

Appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthy and nutritionally
adequate. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the lifecycle.

Finally the [Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx) state:

A vegan eating pattern has many potential health benefits. They include lower rates of obesity, heart disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer. Other benefits include lower blood cholesterol levels and a lower risk for gallstones and intestinal problems.

This eating pattern can take some extra planning. Vegans must make sure that enough nutrients like protein, iron, zinc, calcium, vitamins D and B12 and omega-3 fats are included.

A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors. 




 I feel like I had [a very similar discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/3d0yof/til_the_daily_water_footprint_of_a_person_eating/ct0z06t?context=3) with someone else in this thread who tried to make everything about me instead of actually looking at the consequences of their own actions.  




 You might find /r/vegrecipes and /r/veganrecipes to be useful resources for finding meal ideas. Everyone's tastes will differ, but if you look through the top posts you can see what a lot of people have enjoyed. 




 It must be due to lack of fiber. 




 I'm not forcing you to do anything. I will give you reasons why choosing to cut out animal products is a substantial and important thing to do to lessen the harm you cause to others, but that is all. 




 Causing less harm to others is better than causing more harm. It makes you a better person to choose the former.

I don't care if I'm better than you or not. You should care about trying to be the best person you can be. 




 Animals suffer as individuals, not as a species. 

Imagine we lived in the world of the Matrix where humans were bred by the tens of billions to be used for energy. Our concern should be the well-being of humans as individuals, not the fact that we would go from a population of 50 billion humans down to a more reasonable 7 billion if we stopped humans from being bred excessively. 

Our concern for other animals ought to be the same. There is value in preserving biodiversity, but our primary concern should be for the well-being of the individuals. 




 Any diet needs to be planned appropriately in order to be healthy. No dietetic association is going to say a certain diet is healthy without caveats to ensure that it meets all our nutritional needs.  




 Yeah, using less water is so stupid...

 With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.

**[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**

 A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

 Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**

 Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

**[The Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446)**

  A well-planned vegetarian diet (*see context*) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.

**[The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada](http://www.heartandstroke.com/site/c.ikIQLcMWJtE/b.3484249/k.2F6C/Healthy_living__Vegetarian_diets.htm)**

4. Heat a large pan over medium heat and coat the bottom with a thin layer of olive oil. Place burgers in the hot pan and cook for about 10 minutes, flipping once, until burgers are heated through.

5. If grilling the burgers, grill over medium heat and rub a little bit of olive oil on the grill to ensure that the burgers don't stick.

6. Top veggie burgers with curry cilantro mayo and enjoy on a bun with toppings of your choice! 









 A small-scale, local, "humane" pig farmer reveals several of the ethical issues that still exist with such methods of raising animals for slaughter, including the issue of pigs who are the last ones remaining alive in the slaughterhouse after all of their companions have been killed, what he describes as the so-called "Last Pig Problem".

 Nothing you do can overcome all of the biases people will have against veganism. You can do some things to overcome a lot of it, but there is nothing you can do that will make everyone open to fairly considering what you have to say.

Appearance plays a big role in getting people to take you seriously. You will do much better if you have a clean haircut and decent clothes.

Another important aspect is to use as mainstream of sources as possible. Don't use Freelee as a banana girl as a source to support why you think vegan diets are healthy, reference the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.

Finally, act like you understand where people are coming from. You don't need to condone the consumption of animal products, but if you acknowledge people's experiences and beliefs they will be much more willing to hear you out.

 But fewer slaves would have been better than the alternative. In fact, while people were pushing for abolition, they were also abstaining from products like tobacco and sugar that were produced by slaves, choosing alternatives instead.  




 not just for the people who were freed, but also for people who would never be born to suffer the injustice of slavery. 




 When Britain passed the Slave Trade Act 1807 the only people who became slaves were people who were bred and born to be slaves. I think we can both recognize that it still made a difference to abolish slavery outright, not just for the people who were freed, but also for people who would never be born to suffer the injustice of slavery. 




 It makes a world of difference for the animals who are not suffering and dying as a result. This has made more difference for these animals than increasing cage space or slowing growth rates ever could.

 Avoiding meat isn't going to stop all death in the world or even all of the harm that befalls animals. It is still an effective way to substantially reduce the amount of harm we are causing to animals. 

You similarly make reasonable efforts to avoid harming humans despite the fact that some human deaths will be caused by pollution that you contribute to. 






































































































































 Between anthropogenic global warming and heliocentric solar system? 




 You're somewhere between evolution denial and denying the sun is the center of the solar system on this one. The scientific consensus is strong. 




 I'd be interested in chatting with Tim. He is someone that I can picture as being a redditor already too. 




 Jesus didn't ride to America on a dinosaur to eat brown mustard! 




 I hope it is vegan porn. 




 These aren't studies. These are the positions of the world's leading dietetic organizations that have reviewed the entire body of relevant research to draw their conclusions. The ADA backs up their position by citing over 200 studies. You have no expertise or training in the field and have cited zero studies to back up your claims.

 Authority Nutrition is not an authority on nutrition.

**[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**

 It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

**[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**

 A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.

**[The British National Health Service](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx)**

 With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.

**[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**

 A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

 Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**

 Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

**[The Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446)**

  A well-planned vegetarian diet (*see context*) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.

**[The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada](http://www.heartandstroke.com/site/c.ikIQLcMWJtE/b.3484249/k.2F6C/Healthy_living__Vegetarian_diets.htm)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can provide all the nutrients you need at any age, as well as some additional health benefits. 




 Culture is not an excuse for animal abuse!

You're right that things done in our own cultures could be similarly described as animal abuse. We should work to end these things in our own culture, not simply excuse other cases of animal abuse because we haven't addressed every case yet.

 /u/yourlycantbsrs just articulated point by point his reasons for disagreement with OPs comments. That is called having a discussion. 

Replying to that discussion with a four word fragment of a thought in attempt to derail the discussion is called trolling.

  I will continue to eat ~~whatever~~ **whoever** I want

Animals are not objects. They are individuals with desires and interests of their own. An ethical person needs to take into account the impact their actions have on others when deciding how to behave. 




 I'm not a big fan of Chorizo, but I use their ground meat product often to make homemade chili or a meaty pasta sauce. 




 The food chain isn't an ethical theory. It doesn't tell you how you ought to behave any more than the water cycle tells you not to dam rivers or build canals. 




 There is more to determining how you ought to behave than simply stating what you enjoy. You also need to consider the impact your actions are having on others. 




 The issue is that people go to the store and see packaging with green pastures and happy animals and believe that is how the animals are raised. People see terms like "humane" and "organic" and are similarly deceived into picturing unrealistic conditions. However, when undercover investigators go and film the facilities behind these labels the resulting footage is always cramped conditions and incredibly cruel treatment. 




 They are amazing! I love their burgers! 




 Esther does live in the same house as her dads. They have lots of videos of her bringing big sticks into the house with her. 




 It wasn't my comment.
