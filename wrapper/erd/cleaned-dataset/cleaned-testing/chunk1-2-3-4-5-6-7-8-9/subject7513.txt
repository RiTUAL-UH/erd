 No. 




 This is precisely the type of intellect that successfully crashed the gun legislation in the Senate. Keep up the brilliant rhetoric. 




 So every gun is misused, but the internet is only occasionally misused by pedophiles? Yeah... 




 I'm only asking  - if you want the government monitoring every weapon, why not allow for them to monitor every email? 





























 So you don't trust the government to monitor your internet activity, but you trust them to be the only ones with big guns? Brilliant. 




 why would buying a gun mean a school shooting? More people use the internet to harm children than use guns to harm children. 




 I'm questioning the validity of regulating either. Loughner had a legally purchased handgun when he went after Giffords but she is advocating banning AR15's? To me it's the equivalent of one saying "I'm the victim of a hate crime, it's time we ban CO2 emissions". 




 'The people that around me' care deeply about your personal sympathies. 




 Every knife is designed to kill as well. But most don't. It depends whos hands you place it in. The same for guns, the Internet, vehicles, fertilizer etc. Anything can be misused in the wrong hands. But we should just monitor everything all the time to be safe and to protect the children. 
























 No one should be OK with this. 









 Let's beat our chests and grunt while womenfolk bring us meat. Primate. 









 A knife is designed to kill just as a gun is. If you put a knife in your grandmothers hand, sliced bread. Put it in Ted Bundys, sliced teenager. Some could argue a gun is designed for target practice. It depends again on who is holding it. 





























 Appropriate spanking is needed in this country. There is absolutely nothing wrong with slapping your child across the mouth when he or she back talks, how else will they learn not to??? 














 Because now is the time we prove to the world that our system works, not bend it, twist it, manipulate it and prove precisely why it doesn't. There is a larger picture here. The general publics media-fueled primitive thirst for instant vengeance is not beneficial to this country. 
























 Hashtag alcoholism 




 I don't think you know the meaning of what you just said. There are contradictions in your sentence that nearly created a tear in the fabric of space-time.  









 If an Hispanic man being found innocent via a completely legal jury is openly called racism by our president, what is the blatant ignoring of an entire city that is predominantly black called? No one seems to care that Detroit specifically and Michigan generally is falling into the ground. If this were Santa Barbara or Arlington, you would see overnight Congressional bipartisan councils moving mountains to assist. 







































 I would love to watch your movies, but I am sickened by your face What should I do? 




 It amazes me that the war of minds is so simple. Run a headline like this, immediately drum up support for intervention. Run a headline that the United States destroys a civilian building and kills hundreds, it only drums up excuses at best.

I guess senseless murder is only evil when it's the other people doing it.

 




 Uh huh. 





























 Somewhere a trustfund is slowly shriveling so that we can see his face at every Con. 




 No, I mean for identifying petrographic thin section slides. I'm not sure how that would enable one to cheat on a final, that would almost be as pathetic as assuming a question looking for a good book is akin to cheating. 









 The word reboot is being seriously abused here. 
























 So the glasses didn't transform him into the intelligent one? I'm SHOCKED 














 The 1950's called, they want their "blank called they want their blank back" reference back. Bam. Doucheception 




 Not all the time. You could just be grossly uneducated! 
























 A persons conviction is true to them from their experiences. The fact others don't agree is what makes it unpopular. For example, my opinion is that every man that drinks alcohol has small genitals. Drunk men will not agree. Tough shit. 




 You're not obligated to read this subreddit, which is specifically labeled as a collection of unpopular opinions. Just letting you know, not sure if anyone ever told you that. 




 So as long as the unpopular opinion isn't really unpopular we're cool. Got it. 




 I'm of the opinion you're a cunt. But it's based on very educational formulations of hypothesis based on the principles of the scientific validation process.
