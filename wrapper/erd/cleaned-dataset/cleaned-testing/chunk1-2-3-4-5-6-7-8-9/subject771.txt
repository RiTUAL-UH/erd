 Also, large cities in China are targeted for hydrogen bomb drops.  Civilian populations are directly targeted, and Shanghai and Beijing are reduced to radioactive rubble several times over.  Fields and rice patties are targeted for massive bombing campaigns with napalm, and WP bombs.

The USA attacks DPRK, and China with the full force of the military, and we do not relent until they are pounded into complete and utter devastation and defeat. 









 He refuses to make any more televised appearances, and does not give a farewell address on his last day.  He simply leaves when the new president arrives at the office.  No fanfare, nothing.  His term is done.  He gets on Executive 1, and departs without a word to the media. 




 Such as on American TV, they can't even say "piss", "shit" "damned", "hell", or "bastard" without getting bleeped out, and if you say "the lord's name in vain in public, you'll get dirty looks.

But on British TV that I watch, (yes, it's BBC News, and BBC America), they don't seem to care at all.  They'll use them all day long, and nobody gives a shit.  Australlian TV is even more liberal.  They even include the heavy cuss words like "fuck" and "cunt".

So what's up with the cultural differences?  Why are Americans so puritanicall with language, and don't seem to realize that saying "gosh dang it" is just G rated substitution for "god damn it", and "Shut the front door!" is a substitute for "Shut the fuck up!"?  Everybody knows what is being said.  But some words have magical offending properties, while others do not. 

Please explain.

**EDIT:**  I'm surprised "douchebag" is allowed on TV, and "ass" and "hole" are, but "asshole" is not, (on American TV). 


































 Such as, when I speak into the mic, it comes out of my speakers.  In Windows 10, it doesn't do this.  How do I re-enable this feature again? 



















 On every application from Speedtest to downloading on Chrome, the speeds are consistent with my home Wi-Fi connection at 50Mbps.  

However, when I fire up Google Play, the download speeds are measured in Kb, forget about Mbps.  It works in everything else, except for Google Play.  It's slow enough, that updating something 20MB in size takes about 45 minutes.   









 Is there an official ROM for this yet, or is it still a waiting game?  Also, what would happen if I tried to push "Blur_Version.220.21.28.falcon_umtsds.AsiaRetail.en.03.zip" to the USA version?  Would it make any difference as far as the baseband is concerned?  Would it nuke the phone? 






























































































 I tried DD-WRT, but now I run Tomato v26RT-N.  It works fine, but I'm wondering if there are any more OSes that are supported on the e1000 router. 





































































 Also, what would they think/say if a person said something like:

"Probably living in a 40 year old doublewide trailer, using kerosene for heat, and propane and wood for cooking. Still working for below minimum wage, and using a generator backed up by a UPS, solar, wind, and a bank of car batteries; for the minimal electricity I need to survive." 





























 My cat somehow figured out how to fire up WMP, and start up my play list.  Fucking rude awakening, but at least it wasn't a bad song.  I was just clueless on how it got fired up until I closed all of my browser windows. 
























 Mildly fucked up at work today. Was cashiering, and I put all of their merchandise back in the buggy since I was running out of bags. She asked, "Where's my shit?" So I said back, "I put all your shit back in the buggy. I mean stuff. I put your stuff back in the buggy. Oops, sorry about that." She laughed, and didn't care that I slipped up. I think because she started using cuss words first, so I just responded how I naturally would.

 I don't care if it's in Pullman or Moscow, (I work in Moscow though).  I would LIKE a 2bdrm 1 ba (1 for my bedroom, one for a shop/cat room). But a 1bdrm 1 ba would be adequate.  (Yes, I want the cat to have her own room).  Bedrooms are typically fine with the lighting in every place I've had, but I like natural light in the kitchen and bathroom.  (save on energy bills).  It must be pet friendly.  Are there apartments like that around here?  I have one cat.  

Glendimier would suit me, but I don't like that the bathroom doesn't appear to have a fart fan, or any natural lighting, and the kitchen doesn't have any natural lighting.  What options do I have around here? 


















































































































 I fixed the errors I was getting with Windows Update by completly removing Microsoft Office.  WU works fine now, but now I cannot install MSO 2013 on my computer.  The installer launches, but then hangs and force closes.  Is there a way to make it install?

 Went to WM to get soda and dinner, and went through the self-checkout. Those machines are SLOW! I was trying to haul ass like I do at work, but I was faster than the damned machine. It's like they design it for people who don't know what the hell they are doing, and have no realistic expectations of speed.

They need to crank up the response time of those machines. I hate going slow in the checkout lane. Cashiering at WM has taught me how to haul ass doing it, and having to slow down because the machine can't keep up is annoying! 






















































 I know like 3 "phrases" in ASL, (4 if you count the middle finger), but in "universal sign language", language barriers simply don't seem to matter.  While I know not *exactly* what is trying to be communicated, I can get the gist of it.  So why was ASL ever formed in the first place, since "universal sign language" works fine 90+% of the time? 


















































































































 Looking for a new job. No I didn't get canned. I still have the job for as long as I want it, (realistically). I'm just getting tired of the irregular shifts, the inadequate hours, having to schedule myself, and dumb-ass customers who don't know where a buggy is even if I hit them in the ass with it. I've filled out a job app, and I'm wanting out of WM.

If I had 40+ per week, with a regular schedule, and didn't have to do 5 GOD DAMNED JOBS just to get SOMETIMES CLOSE to 40 hours a week, If I didn't have to work 6 days a week, and if I didn't have an irregular schedule, I would LOVE WM! But all of those things haven't happened, so I'm looking for new work.

If I'm successful in getting the job that I'm now applying for, I will like it better than WM. I'll be working M-F, with a REGULAR SCHEDULE and A REGULAR WEEKEND! I WANT THIS JOB! I'm getting sick of retail. Realistically, I'm getting tired of the shitty work situation. I'll give them a 3 week's notice, because I want to finish out my schedule, and give them adequate time to hire my replacement.

To quit immediately would be rude, and I would burn more bridges than it's worth. If I do get this job, it will be the first job I quit in my adult life, instead of getting fired from it. I just want out. I want a regular job, with a regular schedule, doing a regular job. I'm tired of working 5 jobs at 1 employer just to get CLOSE to 40 hours. I also miss O/T. Can't do that at WM!

A lot has changed in 10 years. The last time I worked at WM, I could put in 70 hour weeks, and nobody cared. Now, if I get 40.03 hours, I get a verbal warning to watch the clock. Can't do it. Can't work over 40, or I get my ass chewed. Sick of it. I want out. 



















 Not to keep people in, but to keep people out.  There is a 1KM wide "No Man's Land", and there are landmines, attack dogs, automatically firing machine guns hooked up to motion sensors, armed drones, and border guards are told to "take no prisoners, but shoot on site any intruders".  We use the technology developed by the DDR and current DMZ in Korea to make an impenetrable border. 



















 They also set off an atom bomb at the base of Hoover Dam, and blast it into non-existence.  What happens now? 







































 Every time I try to vote on something, it says "Your vote cannot be cast at this time".  Why? 























































































































 The guy buying all of the stock thinks that slavery is morally wrong, but only sees one way out of it for them.  He "buys" them, then sets them free.  Tells them to head north, and gives them a compass, and a watch. 


































 I came to a stop, put my rig in neutral, set the brake, and ran out and saw if the dude was OK. He was fine, but the engines shit out on him, so I called 911. I was a few counties over in Shoshone county. I damned near shit a brick because a DAMNED PLANE ALMOST LANDED ON ME!  That dude scared the fucking shit out of me.  I heard a "WUNK" on my roof, so I backed off, (what the fuck was that?) then I hear the plane again, and it touches down. 

 HOLY SHIT!  DOWNSHIFT!  DROP THE CLUTCH, NEURAL! 911!  OH FUCK  I'M GONNA KILL THIS GUY!  OH SHIT!  I stopped 30 yards back.  Then I'm on the phone after I see if the guy is still alive.  Scary shit!  STAY NEXT TO THE PLANE!  STAY STILL!  Turns out he ran out of gas, and had to land, so he just went for the nearest highway, and he accidently tried landing on me.  After he hit my roof, he took another pass, (faster), and landed ahead.  WTF?  

**EDIT:** paragraphs 









 Right now, shit's going real bad.  I'm about ready to be homeless, and the only thing I'll have left is what I can haul on my back, and my cat.  Unless change happens really soon, I'm going to end up homeless, and I'll be resorted to armed robbery to pay the bills.  My SIL is even leaving.  I don't know what to do, but I'm going to soon lose everything unless shit changes really fast.  The thought of doing a hostile takeover because of an emergent situation has never occurred to me, but I'm about ready to go knock over a service station.  Right now, I basically have nothing to lose, so why keep alive? 





































































 Except for potentially killing myself if I build it wrong, what If I do it, and set it off?  Also, how to do so safely in town?  OK, I might build 2, and torch them off, but what would happen if I got caught?  Is it worth the risk?  I wouldn't be using them as weapons, just to make a hell of a boom, (and run like my ass is on fire because nitro). 
























 Drop trou, and fuck it in the ass. 














 Since tasers are LTL options, (like I as a civillian have the option of pommelling you with my knife, or turning it around and spearing you with it, and after that drawing a gun and stopping you), but if I pommeled a person to stop a threat, (Ideally I don't want to get that close if I have to use it), I would be arrested if I hit somebody in the temple and accidently killed them even if it was self-defense.  Then released because if I'm drawing a weapon and was using proper escalation of force, then no charges filed in WA state).

But what happens if a cop pulls a taser, uses it, and the guy drops dead?  Would an investigation occur?  I personally won't pull anything on anybody unless I intend on using it, and am pretty sure I might have to. 














 Such as lines instead of saying "Then I told him that he's clueless", they wrote something like "All y'all don't know jack shit, eh?  Fuck ya!" 









 Oh, and what's your thoughts to "Not yet.  I just got off of work, I'm going home to do exactly that."  I got stopped 4 days ago because my headlight was out of alignment and I was apparently blinding him when I passed.  He smiled when I said that, then it was back to business.  Now I have to figure out how to re-align my head light. 









 The only time I was terminated from a job, (and borderline suicidal), I used my sunglasses to hide my emotions  They couldn't tell anything was wrong since I had my eyes covered. 





























 Then a police officer grabs me, (one hand on my shoulder, and one hand on my right hand to restrain me).  Why did he do that?  I spun around and was about ready to deck the guy because I though somebody was going to rob me, but I stopped once I recognized that it's a cop, and not somebody going to rob/assault me.  So why did he feel the need to mildly restrain me, to risk getting punched in the face?  

Once I saw it was a city officer, I stood down, but I thought it was some random dude trying to stop me from getting away from the several mortars about ready to shoot off.  He should have shouted over his bull horn, eh?

He asked me if I owned this road, and told him "no, but nobody else is using it eh?  so I'm setting off fireworks."  He stood there and watched the fireworks with me, then ran my background info, then told me not to set off fireworks in a public roadway.

  Then he told me to pack up my shit and go to the parking lot if I'm intent on setting off fireworks, so I did.  He shook his head, and took off. 




 Ever since updating to 10051, the start menu doesn't work, and nor does Project Spartan.  I ran sfc /scannow, to try and fix it, but that didn't do anything for those two issues. 



















 How do I fix it?  I can still launch shit with the search function, but start is completely non-functional. 




 Stopping people for minor traffic violations, (didn't signal, broken headlight on passenger side, and turned into the far lane) just to get a verbal warning, and when they stick their head in the rig, it's obvious that they're trying to smell drugs/alcohol, so I suspect that was the "real reason" for the stop?

Is that a thing, or am I paranoid?  No, I wasn't drinking, Just nobody was there, so I pulled into the left lane.  I got let off and basically told "don't do that", then sent on my merry way.  This just happened, if it helps. 




 Such as a brown bear, you make yourself bigger and charge it if you can.  The bear will likely be scared off, as it now thinks you're a threat to it

Dogs, slowly back off while not turning your back, always locking eyes with it, (if you turn and run, it will kill you).

Large cats, you stop moving, and slowly back off, never losing eye contact.  Get to safety, but slowly.  If you run, you're now the prey, and it will kill you.

Gators, RUN. If you run your ass off, they'll give up after a few meters.  Try and stare down a gator, you're not gonna have a good day. 




 While driving down the road, how do police decide to not stop somebody going VERY FAST (2-3 times the speed limit, running lights (reasonably safely, but emergently) , and blaring his horn and having on the 4 ways while flashing his high beams), Is it because he's on the phone to 911 and talking to dispatch as it happens "live", or some other reason?

When my wife cut her hand on a stupid-ass soup can, I was honestly faster than the ambulance, so "get in my truck and buckle up.  We're hauling ass".  After she got in my rig, I went 65 through town through 20 zones, and police actually got out of my way.  

I was heading the most direct rout for the hospital that I possibly could, and had my 4 ways on and was jumping lights.  I think it was pretty damned obvious that it was an emergency, ( I normally don't drive like that,  eh?)  But they knew to get out of my way and close down intersections somehow.  Is it because I was on the phone to dispatch ( 911 ), while I was rushing to the hospital as fast as I felt safe going?  

No, I didn't jump lights if it was unsafe, but if there was a gap, I did the left, right forward?  CLEAR  thing?  While I ran several lights, and wouldn't have stopped until the hospital, (then surrendered, because somebody bleeding to death on me), everybody (including several emgergency vehicles were just getting out of my way.  About half way there, I got a lead rig and a pilot rig.  How did they know that I needed a police escort when all I gave on the phone was present location, description of the vehicle, license plate number, and direction of heading?  How the fuck did the cops know not to stop me, clear the roads, and take me to the hospital? 





























 How does one adopt non-local vernacular?  I've adopted several sayings, and I honestly have no clue where I got them from.  I'm a native to Eastern WA, (Whitman County).  I've managed to pick up the following words and I don't know how or why:

Buggy = "shopping cart"

Y'all = "You all / you guys / you"

Eh? = "Huh? / what? / right? / yeah?"

Sup = "What's up?"

Pillock = "Dick"

Arse = "ass"

Thank god I didn't adopt "cunt", or "hoser", eh? 

Sorry if this a "shit post", (whatever the hell that is), but I don't know where else to ask this.

And why don't people know what a buggy is?  I don't get it.  "shopping cart" now sounds dumb to me. 









 Because God doesn't trust the English in the dark, eh? 
























 I have 2GB of RAM installed, if it matters. 
























 To me, it's a 4 wheeled thing you shove around a store to load your shit in.  I met an Alaskan today, and he thinks it's a strange moterized vehicle that looks like a rock crawler, but designed for mud.  Around here, we call those  "rock crawlers".

He was talking about how much shit he can fit in his buggy, and I was getting confused, so I said "buggy?  you mean that thing that you do this with in stores?", (did the buggy shoving gesture).  He then tried to describe what he meant, but I still had to guess.  I had no clue what he was talking about for about 3 min, until I asked, "like a rock crawler?" 




 Like "g CZ52" and it goes through Google, but if I type "b CZ52", it does the same search but through bing? 




 If I do it, it's armed robbery and I face 10-life. If the government does it, it's tax collection, and publicly applauded. 




 A black hole. Because once you go black, you never come back. 





























 Why not?  I have it connected through FB.

 In WA, I don't think I can conceal my ka-bar, (because of the "dangerous weapons" law, but in ID, I can, so long as I have an ID LCCW, or WA CPL.  I called the police, and while I can open carry basically anything I want, I can't "Furtively" carry any dangerous weapon, (except pistol since I'm licensed to do so).  So why the law difference?

Also, is it a good idea to inform, even though I don't have to?  I got in a collision back in 2012, and an officer responded.  After asking for DL/reg/ins, 

I gave him all the paperwork, and also gave him my CPL, and told him that "Since I'm armed today, here is my CPL."  He just looked at it, asked me where it as, and said "cool, if you don't touch yours, I won't touch mine."  I didn't care, but I felt like I should inform the officer even if I legally don't have to. 



















 I was formally employed as a cashier/assembler/toy sales associate/cart associate/freight unloader at Walmart, and recently left that job.  I got a new job as a landscape maintenance technician, and MY GOD, the labor is hard work!

Before I worked at Walmart, I was a car wash guy, and before that, I was a groundskeeper.  I don't remember how long it took me to adjust to manual labor, so I'm asking here.  It's Saturday, and my muscles still hurt from the work week.

 Some people are wondering where Montgomery Ward's is, as it was just there yesterday, but now it turned into a Big 5 overnight. 









 Just for shits and grins, I burnt a DVD, and decided to re-install.  A USB drive takes all of 20 min, (max), but from a DVD, it takes over an hour to install the OS.  MS should by default provide USB drives to install the OS, and have them fill out a form if they want a DVD, (like was done until Windows XP, with shipping CD's and including a card that if you want FDD's to write MS)

MS should transition to USB installation.  Installing W10 with a DVD is the first time I've even used that drive since 2010. 
























 Some of them are wondering where Montgomery Ward's is, because it used to be there yesterday, but it's now a Big5 over night.

 I tried to replace the front glass, (not very sucessfull).  I got the front glass off, but the LCD was still stuck to the screen, even after heating it up with a hair dryer.  at first, none of the buttons except for power and volUp and VolDn were working, so I took apart the phone completly, (MB, and screen/bezel assembly as one unit) and noticed that a connecter came loose on the touch screen link to the lower buttons.  

I got the home, menu, and back buttons to work again, but I still can't use the touch screen at all.  It simply doesn't recognize input.  Is there a way to fix the touch screen?  It displays everything fine, but input via touch is now impossible.  Is there a connecter that I may have missed?  I would like to not spend $71 if I don't have to buy a new front screen/bezel assembly.

**EDIT:**  Well, now that I tore it apart again, and put it back together, the phone won't turn on at all.  :(  Fuck.  Now it looks like I'm going to have to buy one. :(  I'm now back to my backup phone, which is a i997 flashed with CM11 (unofficial) 4.4.4.  Do you think I EMPed it by accident? Even plugging it in, it won't signify charging at all. 



















 

The phone identifies as an i9300 in the sticker in the back of the phone, and in the ROM. However, when I boot into download mode, it shows up as an i747, and trying to flash a i9300 ROM fails. Is there a way to resolve this? 




 MS!  GET RID OF THE "LESS OPTIONS" IN TASK MANAGER!  It's Fucking USELESS!  I can't use it for shit!  "More Options" should be the default, (and only option for task manager).  The way it's set up now, it's little more useful than the task bar!  If I go Ctrl+Shift+Escape, I WANT THE FUCKING TASK MANAGER!  WHY DO YOU TORTURE US LIKE THIS?  

The way its used now is fucking retarded and useless!  Get rid of it!  Bring the old style back!  OK, done rant now.  But seriously, whoever thought of that needs to be bitch slapped! 









 "Fuck the police!"  I'm not talking about spouting off at the mouth, but making his land a deadly trap to anything that moves.  Anything that intrudes is shot on site.  Now what?  They will not be negotiated with.  They have RPG-7's, and aren't afraid to use them.  Prisoners ar taken, and severely tortured on live TV before execution. 



















 Example:  We got in WWII because of the Jewish holocaust.

No, we didn't.  We didn't even recognize them until 1943, when the war machine was starting to lose support, so it was revealed to the American public about execution camps, so we must fight the evil. The USA actually turned back Jewish refugees in 1938, because we didn't want them either.  (Source:  http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005267 ) 

We REALLY got involve in WWII because we embargoed the japs for oil, so we got struck in the territory of HI, so we declared war on them.  Then, since JP was allied with GE, they declared war on us.  Boom!  WWII.  The rest is history as we know it.

Anyhow, how do these modern propaganda stories get passed down as fact, when they are incredibly wrong, and why do people believe it, when even a modicum of research would prove it wrong? 




 If you aren't liberal, you're "not a true atheist". The only thing missing is worship of a deity. Oh wait, most "practicing" atheists these days do worship something. Government has taken the place of a god. So it's a secular religion for most "practitioners" of atheism. If you don't comply to the "doctrine", you will be rooted out, and banned on FB. Small minds think alike, eh? Yeah, they're "tolerant", so long as you agree with them. 




   Would Obama start cussing to nobody in particular while live on the air?  How far would he get before the networks cut away from him or he realized he was uttering a stream of profanities before he stopped talking and left the stage? 

















































 My cat is an indoor cat, but a few times she has gotten outside, she doesn't even leave the property, and when I had her at my old place, (an apartment), she never left the stoop of my place.  

But she swill wants outside even though she never leaves my property, (a tenth of an acre).  She even restricts herself to the front lawn when she does get out. She's not a wanderer, so why does she even want out?  When the weather's nice, I leave open a couple of windows so she can look out, but she still wants out. 









 It is done so nobody calls the air force to report a UFO and strange lights all over America that cause the sky to glow all night long for over 4 weeks.  (basically "Oooh, look at the pretty lights!" is what it is passed off as).

But here's the catch:  The test is really to see what a HEMP would do the CONUS, and the test is not only hailed as a "progress of mankind" or some such bullshit, but it's really a covert mission to EMP the entire USA before the fucking Russians can do it, just to take the "wind out of their sails".

Now what?

 Anybody else remember the first time they heard of "green tech"?  I first heard of it when my boss said "We're going to make our workplace green".  My reaction was "Ew, Why?  Green's an ugly color.  Why would anybody do that?  What the fuck?  But if you want me to paint the houses green, OK."  I got laughed at and I didn't know why.

 Horse style, doggy style, any style!

 Oh dear!

 No, no! Deer run too fast. 












































 Back in 96, I crossed into canada on a band trip.  I got asked 3 questions:  

1.  Do you have any weapons in the vehicle?  (my knife)
1b.  OK, do you have any firearms in the vehicle?  (no)

2.  How long to you plan to be in Canada?  (a week, I want to go to the Edmonton Mall, and I play the bass drum in the percussion section, I'm on a band trip).

3.  Business or pleasure?  (pleasure)

On re-entry into the USA, I got asked one question:

1.  Are you a lawful resident of the USA? (yes)

It was easy to cross international borders then.  Now, I need a passport, and documentation to prove that I'm legally in the USA to even leave, let alone get back.  It's fucking retarded.  Back in 96, I TRIED to show my ID, and they had me put it away, and said "verbally, are you authorised to be in the United States?" I responded, Uh, yeah?  Why else would I be on this bus?  The INS guy just shook his head and said "You'd be surprised", and kept on moving down the line.  

We almost got stopped because we had a russian immigrant aboard, and I'm glad we didn't, because I bought a CO2 pistol in Canada, and was smuggling it across international boundaries.  And some chew too. :)  

But these days, I can't even go to Canada, (or reenter the USA legally), without a passport or an EDL.

**EDIT:** It seems like we're becoming the USSR, and employing the exact same practices we used to ridicule them for.  I guess "Welcome to the USSA:  Land of the Fee, Home of the Slave." 














 I have a 15" sub that's been doing nothing for the last decade. it still worked when I took it out of my rig back in 2002, and I just never got around to installing it again. I realistically will never install it in my vehicle again, but I don't want to get rid of it because it cost me over $500 back in 1999. I want to hook it up to my home audio system. How would I go about doing this? It's just the speaker, not amplified. 









 How well does it work for decrypting QAM channels? 


































 I have a budget of $100. I need to be able to pick up QAM and ATSC TV. Also NTSC, as there is 1 repeater here that still broadcast in NTSC, and the local cable system (basic service), is analog still. What is the best tuner that I can get for under $100? I have money now, so I want a decent tuner for under $100. Antenna isn't really an option here, according to my TV Fool report: www dot tvfool dot com /?option=com_wrapper Itemid=29 q=id%3df1f0978977115 e]. I want ATSC capabilities because I might some day move to an area where I can pick up OTA signals, and an NTSC tuner because we still have an analog cable system here for Extended basic service.
 














 If you go to your clock/calander in the taskbar, single click on it to bring up the calander, and click "more clocks", you get an option for an alarm clock, world clock, countdown timer, and stopwatch. :)  ABOUT TIME!  Now I don't need third party software to do all of this. :) 

















































































































































































































 Such as a 20" CRT TV is easily watchable from 10 feet away, but a 20" LCD TV is hard to make out what is going on on the screen.  Forget about trying to read any text from 10 feet away on a LCD when watching something in SD format. 
























 What is a fairly decent ATSC/QAM box for my TV?  It would be nice if it could receive NTSC signals too, so I wouldn't need to jockey between using the remote for the TV, and the remote for the box, but just use the box.  I have a budget of $100.  Any recommendations? 



















 Microsoft's new browser, formally referred to as "Project Spartan" is officially going to be called "Microsoft Edge".

I wonder if they'll use Aerosmith's "Livin' On The Edge"  to market it, like they used "Start Me Up" from the Rolling Stones to market Windows 95? 





























 Surround baltimore with concentra wire, and make it a "no-go" zone. Ban the media from entering because of "security reasons". Cut the phone lines, power, and water. Disable cellular service, and internet access. Don't respond to any emergencies, and let the place burn down. Close down the hospitals. Nothing gets in or out except for food, which will be air dropped once a day in the form of MRE's. Let it burn. Because of the scum there, that city would shortly turn into a 3rd world hell hole making Mogadishu look like Disney World. They hate police and emergency responders? Fine. Let's see how well they get along without them at all. 























































































































 It's no longer on channel 9, instead I'm getting a station called "Antenna TV".  Where did Fox28 go on the analog feed? 









 [Slow-moving vehicle to pull off roadway.](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=46.61.427)

Why does this need to be a law? If you're holding up traffic, PULL OVER! NOT HARD PEOPLE! (queue flashback to 2002 when I threw an engine rod on the Lewiston Hill, and drove in the shoulder, called my mom because my engine blew up, pissed in my radiator just to make it to WA state line to shut off my engine). 

Fuck. If you're holding up traffic, PULL OVER! The Lewiston hill is beautiful at 7MPH, and it takes about an hour to get up it, even flagged by the state bull.  Let them pass, keep on your way, and only get back in the lane once you let everybody by, (optimally, just drive on the shoulder).
 




 I ask because my DL is about to expire, and I honestly can't afford the renewal fee.  I know I can operate a Moped on a standard DL, but what if I can't afford to renew it?  Can I run an electric scooter legally?  Yes, I will wear a helmet.  

If it's faster than a bike, I wear a helmet, (even if only a bike helmet).  I got saved once by a helmet, and I'm not riding anything that has power behind it without one).  But if I can't afford to renew my license/registration, can I get on my scooter and go to work?

I'l keep off of the public highways when I can, but if there's no sidewalk or shoulder, then I'll keep in the right lane.  Do I need one of those orange triangles on my back, (because I'm going less than 35).  No, I'm not getting on the interstate. 









 I'm in Eastern WA, and I just heard a couple robins chirp outside of my window.  Time is now 0148, and it doesn't even start getting light until around 0542.  Why are they chirping in the dark?  WTF? 














 I'm not sure where to put this, as it's not on a physical Macintosh, but it's on a emulated PPC running in SheepShaver on my Windows 10 installation.  I have gotten 9.0.4 up and running fine, but when I try to download the free 9.1 update to MacOS from Apple, it just redirects to Apple Support.  It appears that they have pulled it. Where can I get the free 9.1 update?

 When I upgraded to 10056, I downloaded the wrong ISO, and accidentally changed my Pro TP into Enterprise TP.  I really don't have a need for Enterprise, so when the next release is made available, can I just upgrade the build to Pro, or will I need to clean install? 







































 The "social scene". "Hanging out" without an explicit purpose is pointless and over rated. 




 Surfing the internet, watching TV, smoking cigarettes, and drinking beer. 




 Had a job that pays over $10/hr. 




 Really, the only way to get the corrupt people out is with general unrest, so the corrupt individuals fear enough for their lives that they either flee the country, or just walk off the post.  I think causing general unrest would lead to a reformation.  

But the bad part about revolutions is; it is impossible to predict what new government would form.  It could turn into a Porfirio Diaz dictatorship again, or be like Somalia on our border. 




 Correct, it's nice dreams. :)  That movie rocks! :) 




 No, at the choke points, we would arrest entrants into the country, and deport them 2000 miles into mexico.  They just get shipped back, but not blown halfway to hell.    I don't think the CIA backed coup would do much good, in addition to the corrupt federal government, you also have the leaders of the federal police, the state and local governments, and the Mexican military.  

That whole country is corrupt, and I think we should drop Mexico from NAFTA, and impose heavy trade tariffs of 50% or greater for any goods imported from Mexico.  Do a war of economic attrition.  Also, don't export anything to Mexico.  Of course, this didn't exactly work with Cuba, so Mexico may be a lost cause. 




 VW Beetles are the best car, because if you drive in the water accidently, it'll float for hours before it sinks, and you can use it like a boat since the engine is at the rear. 




 The Day After (1983) 




 Epicenter of a thermonuclear detonation, riding the bomb like Dr. Strangelove. 




 Go without showering, since I showered the night before.  Wash face, shave, put on clothes, out the door I go. 




 Because they're a manual laborer, and don't want to get their house dirty from the day's work.  That's why I do. 




 Blumpkin Inspector. 




 No, that was the immigration law at the time in the 1800's.  If they were a criminal back home, (literally, wanted for committing a crime), they were denied entry into the USA.  I'm not calling people who jump the border criminals.  It's at most a civil infraction, much like speeding.  

Also, the Indians were too busy fighting each other, and they really had no concept of land ownership.  They had hunting grounds, and areas they lived in during different times of the year, but no borders. 




 Yes, 1 lid ~ 1 oz.  Most people didn't have scales in the 70's.

Before pot was legal here, it went dime bag, 20 sack, 8th, QO, HO, OZ.  I've never ordered more than that.  Fortunately now, if I want pot, I just go to the store and buy it. :) 














 The fall of the inner-german border. Bet on it November 7 of 89. I would be a billionaire. 




 Drink beer and watch TV. 




 Get drunk. 




 Marijuana. 




 Mutual fellatio. 




 When my ancestors came here, there was no border control beyond Ellis Island, and the only thing they looked for then was lack of "consumption", not be chinese, not be a criminal, and pay $0.50.  The 1800's basically HAD no immigration laws.  You can't illegally immigrate to a place with no border controls. 




 "HEY! Somebody ripped off the thing I ripped off!" 




 Cheech and Chong. 




 Only because of the 1878 PCA.  It could be repealed by congress with a simple majority vote.  It is not constitutionally prohibited, nor does the PCA prohibit the national guard from operating as a police force when called into action by the governor of the state. 









 We should do that! :) 




 A Honda, but he didn't talk about it. "For I did not speak of my own Accord." John 12:49.

 Who the fuck cares? More bacon for us! 




 My VCR doesn't even have a clock on it.  It has an internal clock for setting tape times, but not a front display clock. 




 Well, no, I don't want to blow the illegal immigrants half way to hell and back, just the cartels.  Yes, it would be unrealistic to do this, (as it would be very expensive), but we could let a few choke points open, so they have to go through that area if they don't want to get blown up.  I highly doubt the Mexican people are going to stage a revolution against the drug cartels, and corrupt government that can be bought with money.  

From what I read, the Mexican people aren't even allowed to have any semi-automatic weapons, and have to use lever action rifles, or single shots, (and only then, if they aren't a military caliber).  There is no "bringing Mexico up" to our economic level.  With the government in power there, and the cartels, there is no chance in hell of helping that country at all.  I think we fucked up by signing the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.  We could have had that entire country as the USA.  

Except then, we would have to deal with Guatemala.  That border, we could seal.  What I think is sad, is Guatemala is so damned poor, Mexico has an illegal immigration problem from there. 




 That too.  Don't forget about boss cars, fast boats, strip clubs, fine cigars, excellent wine, and vacations so expensive it would make Obama blush. 




 Actually, that's not too far off.  In Peru, a kilo of cocaine costs about [$800](http://www.insightcrime.org/news-briefs/peruvian-cocaine-best-value-for-traffickers-bolivia-police).  Once it gets here to the USA, that same kilo in the USA costs around [$27,000](https://www.stratfor.com/weekly/mexicos-cartels-and-economics-cocaine). Those are wholesale prices.  Then it gets down to the street level, where an 8 ball costs around $350, (the last I checked).  So, that's 3.5g for $350. That's $100,000 of money to buy a kilo of cocaine in the USA off of the street.

Yes, the low-level street dealers, (that often work for below minimum wage), their suppliers, the distributors all get the cut, as do the mules, but most of that money is funneled right back into the Cartel hands. 




 Yes, obviously.  But if they fucked up by backing over a fence post?  They're the ones that damaged property, so they get to fix it.  (I had to do this several times). 




 How?  Yeah, the prison industrial complex would likely dry up, (that's good), ER's wouldn't be so busy with gang shootings and overdoses, the rehab industry wouldn't be so busy.  But all of these are good things. 




 That's why we put up an internal fence to keep them out of the DMZ, and [this sign](http://i.imgur.com/zkRY88P.jpg) pretty much gets the point across of DO NOT CROSS. 




 Not the unarmed ones.  In that case, just call INS/USBP.  But if they start shooting?  Shoot back.  Actually, this is already legal.  The only thing that would change is we would be arming them with military weapons, instead of letting them arm themselves with semi-automatic look-alikes.  I think a few cartel groups getting mowed down with M240 SAWs would send a message.  And if they come with vehicles?  A BGM-71 takes care of that.  

Set up antipersonnel and anti-vehicle mines along the border, and set up hedgehogs lined with concentra wire, and caltrops.  Put in anti-tank ditches too. 




 I dropped out after 1 semester in 2001. I've worked menial jobs all of my life, and I don't expect it to ever change. I'll never be rich, or even middle class. I'm unemployed now, and I'll do anything for work. In my mind, "career" does not exist, it's just some jobs last longer than others. 




 I said only on our side of the border. If they're on your side of the line, they're your problem. You deal with it. But the instant that they cross into US territory, we blast the hell out of them. 




 I think I got my sleep schedule back on track. 




 I have no "passion".  I just exist.  I'll do anything legal to pay the bills.  I don't really care what I do for a living. 




 Anything promoted on MTV or any other reality show. 




 Double dildos. 




 Didn't the USSR have borders that long?  They were pretty successful at keeping people in. (even from other Warsaw Pact countries) 




 [All dressed up, nowhere to go?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhAOlAq_9ME) 




 I thought they were collaborating with the Mexican military, and had their protection? 




 Or anybody else on US territory.  (except for each other, they can kill of each other all they like).  Hell, we should arm the civilians down there with military weapons (light arms, and crew served weapons), and give them immunity for shooting back. 




 No, I thought they were wishing for the modern world back, but TIL. 




 I do, but if I'm watching TV, then I don't need to look at my wrist. 




 Only if fired upon. 




 Not from what I gather from the lyrics.  Why else would you trade hot ashes for trees? 




     Got in a little hometown jam. 
    So they put a rifle in my hand. 
    Sent me off to a foreign land. 
    To go and kill the yellow man

 (nuclear war) [Wish You Were Here  
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXdNnw99-Ic)

    So, so you think you can tell Heaven from Hell, blue skies from pain.
    Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail?
    A smile from a veil?
    Do you think you can tell?

    Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts?
    Hot ashes for trees?
    Hot air for a cool breeze?
    Cold comfort for change?
    Did you exchange a walk on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?

    How I wish, how I wish you were here.
    We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year,
    Running over the same old ground.
    What have we found?

    The same old fears.
    Wish you were here.

(about a wasted life) [Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rL3AgkwbYgo)

    Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day 
    Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way
    Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town
    Waiting for someone or something to show you the way

    Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain
    And you are young and life is long and there is time to kill today
    And then one day you find ten years have got behind you
    No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun

    And you run and you run to catch up with the sun, but it's sinking
    Racing around to come up behind you again
    The sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older
    Shorter of breath and one day closer to death

    Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time
    Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
    Hanging on quiet desperation is the English way
    The time is gone, the song is over, thought I'd something more to say

    Home, home again
    I like to be here when I can
    And when I come home cold and tired
    It's good to warm my bones beside the fire
    Far away across the field
    The tolling of the iron bell
    Calls the faithful to their knees
    To hear the softly spoken magic spells. 




 Youtube. 




 We deploy M1A1 tanks, HMMWV, and apache helicopters, (fully armed).  As soon as fired upon, we blow the intruders off of the face of the earth with Hellfire missiles, 88mm mortars, 120mm shells, and 50 caliber fire.  We will no longer tolerate them in our country, and will use all force necessary to repel them.  However, we do not cross the international border into Mexico. 




 Being eligible to be drafted, (OK, only up until 25).  Voting. 




 Taking on the USSR, and fighting a two-front war.  They should have stomped the UK first. 




 I already have. 




 When I was 17, I wanted to be a locksmith owning my own businuss in Las Vegas, earning around $75000 a year in 1999 dollars, living a couple miles outside of town on a 2 acre property that I owned, with a triple wide mobile home bought on a 15 year mortgage, driving a 2 or 3 year old paid off truck.  If it had gone to plan, I would have about 3 years left on my mortgage, and I would be financially secure with zero debt besides my home.

I'm 32 years old, and still living in the same county that I was born.  I moved 16 miles to town off of the family ranch, and I drive a 18 year old truck, and I live in a rental property.  I'm now unemployed, and the highest wage I've ever earned was $10/hr back in 2008.  So no, my dream did not come true.

I have given up on dreams.  They are futile, and the realm of children.  They serve no purpose in the adult world, and I only exist to survive now.  I see no point in dreaming or fantasizing about that which I will never realistically have, or be able to obtain.  It is a waste of time to dream.  

 




 No.  Every socio-economic stratification has assholes, and generous people, and greedy people, and entitled people. 




 Whatever happened to just having an [analog clock](http://i.imgur.com/bPPD722.jpg) above the TV?

 With my TV, (well, my downstairs TV), I just plugged it in, did a channel scan, and away I go.  Since my TV upstairs is an old CRT TV, I need a QAM box to get the Clear QAM channels, but it works perfectly fine.

Yet, on the TWC website, they say that "I need a box" to be able to receive anything, when I clearly do not.  Are they just gambling on the fact that most consumers will take their word at it, and not try it themselves, (so they don't have to pay the box rental fees)?

 MSTK, Windows Loader, some clever reg hacks, TimeclockReset, and before that, just sharing CD keys.  Oh, don't forget about BIOS hacking, and writing your own SLP table.  Pirates have always found a way to get shit for free, and always likely will.  So why are they claiming that they won't?  This seems like a very familiar claim to Windows XP. 












































 The other day I noticed several rabbits running next to my window.  1, "hey, that's pretty."  2, "Hmm, must be mating season" 5, "Umm?"  10, "what the fuck?  where all all these rabbits coming from?"  20, "OK, time for mister air gun."

I went outside and was starting to set up because it's obvious that I now have a rabbit infestation, I don't want to kill them all, just a few because I don't want my lawn ruined, and they seem to be already wearing a path through my front lawn.

Before I even got set up, I had my pistol just sitting in plain sight, and some dude happens to walk buy and ask "Hey, what type of gun is that?"  I tell him that it's a BB gun, and I seem to have a rabbit infestation, as I just saw 20 run by, so I'm going to reduce the population a bit.  He chuckled, and said softly "fucking rabbits" then in a normal voice, "Well, good luck with that, let me know how it turns out", then just kept on walking.

I got 3 of those fuckers btw, and they're now in my freezer.  I still have to flesh them, but they're gutted.  Yes, I'm going to eat them.   But since people seem to be so alert to even a "huuuu Im hunting wabbits" mission, I don't think a public shooting thing could or would happen here.  :) 












































 I was coming back from Moscow ID buying cigarettes, and this dude pulls up next to me on the last stop light out of town and revs his engine.  I first acted like I didn't hear it, and just kept looking forward.  He revs again, so I rev back, and did a stand on my brakes, and revved up to 3000 RPM.  Light turns green, so I let off of my brakes, and smoke his ass all the way to all of 60.  He keeps on going, and makes it to Pullman sooner than I do by 2 min.  But he's stuck at a stoplight that I just rolled up to, (and I didn't have to stop because I timed it right), so I passed him at 35 MPH.  

He gets on his gas again, and floors it.  He swerves off to a side road, and I just think he's a moron for wanting to race under the conditions.  I wasn't even trying to race the prick, but it seems he thought that I wanted to because I did race him to 60, (the legal speed limit), before backing off.  Stupid idiot didn't clue it I stopped when I reached 60, and kept on trying to race me.

Why are people so damned stupid when it's obviously  no condition to be doing a street race?  Racing is dangerous enough, so what compels them to do it in excessively dangerous situations?  That guy in the white blazer is a damned idiot. 



















 They start broadcasting "THIS IS NOT A DRILL.  THIS IS AN ACTUAL EMERGENCY.  IF YOU ARE NOT IN SHELTER SEEK SHELTER IMMEDIATELY!  THE USSR HAS LAU..." and then the lights go out, and there is no more broadcast.

 What if we leveled Afghanistan, and turned it into a field of radioactive rubble?  The full force of the US military is now on your ass, nukes included.  Nothing will be left standing. 







































 I am introverted by nature, but the (thankfully few), times where I've had to respond to a legit emergency, I seemed to take charge of the situation and even go to the extent of directing traffic until EMS arrived, The other time, I saw a guy hit a deer and almost total his rig.  I kept on going for a little bit, but then decided "I should chek if that guy's even alive, and went 90 back to the schene of the accident.  I pulled up on people crying, and so I took charge and ended up having to shoot a deer with my handgun.  There's no way in hell that I would do this in normal circumstancces.

(I flipped off a bird when i it it , (going too fastt, and the collision made me spill my coffee on my nuts)  I just kept on going.  But in an emergent situation, I seem to stop, and take power within the fullest of my ability.  Why? 




 Just got done watching "Cold War" by Dr Who, and when that alien was about ready to launch, I started trembling in my boots like it was really going to happen  Yes, I lived through the 80's or else I wouldn't be posting this, and reddit, (nor modern tech, nor humans), would exist.

But why did it give me the physical chills and make goosebumps rised, and short of shooting my entire family and myself, I reacted the same as if the EBS system started going off right now. 









 You're hired. 


































 Nope.  If you have analog cable, you'll continue to receive it until your provider decides to shut it off.  There is no requirement for them to keep analog service on, but I still have analog service, and ClearQAM.  Note that they could have shut it off back in 2012 if they wanted to.  I get 63 analog channels, and 25 digital ones. :)  TWC actually does *something* right. :)

B) Trans-sexuals are mentally ill.  If I ever wonder what sex I am, I'll just look in my pants. Do I have a penis?  I'm a man.

C) I'd suck a lot of dick, and get fucked?  Hell if I know.  I've sort of wondered how it feels to take the D.

D)  Gay people are just gay.  I just don't care.  I'm not going to celebrate, or honor it.  I simply don't give a shit.  Big deal.  You're a dude and like other dudes.  Who cares?  But if you want to chop your penis off, you have mental problems. 




 A person is born (in most circumstances), as either XX, (female); or XY, (male).  No matter how much you mutilate yourself to suit your "self-image", you are what you are.  Getting your dick split in half and shoved inside of you, or constructing a penis out of I don't know what makes you no more male/female than me if I walked outside right now dressed in drag saying "I'm a chick now" with a full moustache.  It's not a biological problem; it is a mental problem, and they need heavy drugs and counseling.

 Usually nothing. If I'm ill, I fear that whatever I eat will come back up again, so I don't eat at all. 




 She can, using the liberal's very own standards.  According to liberals, if I want to ID as a martian, I can.  "It's just a personal way of thinking", not a mental illness if I honestly think I'm from mars, but trapped in a human body.  If you judge me, then you're a bigot with the problem, not me. 




 I tried to sign on with my TWC ID, but since I'm only an internet/phone subscriber, I don't get shit.  I want channel surfing, that's why I stay with TV service. How I get it, I honestly don't care.  I miss NTSC. :(  I miss rolloff, instead of this new "digital cliff"  Yeah, watching channels in B/W with almost no audio sucked, but better than nothing.  ATSC standards suck. :(  I'd like to bitch slap the asshole at the FCC who made this decision.  Here's my TV Fool:

I actually get KLEW and K40EE, but K40EE is turning off in a month, since it's still analog. :( 




 Why I still have traditional service?  Because I can just press "up" and watch something new without having to think about it.  No pre-scheduling, no "does thiis meet your standards", no "upvote".  Just change the channel if it sucks what your watching.  That's why I'll never get rid of TV service.  I'm trying to build a decent antenna, but I need to get this thing called a "combiner".  Fuck, antennas have changed a lot over the last 20 years.  Before, the bigger the better. and adjustable antennas were boss.  Now, amplified antennas are complete shit, and outdoor antennas can be used as indoor antennas?  It makes no sense.  Maybe I should go back to buiding my own like I did in the 90's? 




 Hmm. :)  Which Intel cards are compatible with this?  Or should I put up a large wifi Yagi?  I don't have an Xbox, (any generation), but I do have a phone, 2 TV's, laptop, and a desktop. 




 And sometimes they put in the wrong filters too. ;)  Other times, they're completly neglegent, and hook you right up to the line.  Othertimes, you just have basic cable tools, (torque wrench, terminator tool, P-Key), and you have cable access anyhow. ;) 




 That amplified antenna, (it was about as thick as 5 sheets of paper), didn't work at all.  Even PBS was pixilated, and I couldn't get jack shit with it.  Here is my [TV Fool](http://www.tvfool.com/?option=com_wrapper Itemid=29 q=id%3df1f09ad6fb825a).  I also get KLEW and K40EE with a $9 antenna.  I have recently purchased the ClearStream1, and I have yet to test it.  I have it on a 6 foot pole, and need to figure out how to mount it on my roof, (without a ladder). 




 Back in 1999, I did.  But I thought in that movie, humans were powercells, not just a heater? 




 Thanks!  Does this also explain why when there are a large amount of humans in a room, that room is actually hot compared to the rest of the building?  So humans are like portable furnaces that can walk and talk and breathe?

 I don't put on any facade.  I'm 32 years old and independent.  If they don't like my decisions, tough titties for them. 




 Because it makes good TV. 




 AIDS. 




 The amplified antenna that I tried didn't work for shit, but the cheap ass RCA 112F works fine to get 6 channels. 




 Yes, it was one of those flat antennas that you can mount to your wall, or window, or just set it on a desk.  It didn't work for shit.  I now have a cheap ass set of rabbit ears on my downstairs TV, and get 6 channels.  I have to figure out how to mount my Clearview1 to the top of the roof though.  I have it on a 6 foot pole, I just have to figure out how to get up there without a ladder truck. 




 My parents and grandparents actually used large ariels mounted on 50 foot poles.  That was the only way we could pick up anything.  I grew up 16 miles from the nearest town with over 10000 people.  I now live in a small town of only 30000 people.  The nearest city with over 100,000 people is over 75 miles away from me. 




 Dude, I still use my VCR from 1995.

I actually pick up KLEW, and K40EE, (although K40EE is going dark in July).  I just returned the amplfied antenna for the Clearview1, and I'm going to see how that works.  I just have to set up a mount for it.  I need a bucket, and some gravel. 




 Yes, I had it plugged in, and it didn't make a damned bit of difference.  I took it back and exchanged it for a ClearStream 1.  I haven't done a channel scan with it yet, but it should work, considering the cheap-o RCA indoor antenna actually works, (and the Clearstream 1 has good reviews on Amazon.com) 




 Because invisible pink unicorns are always talking. 




 How is this news? Liberals run on nothing but feelings, logic be damned. 




 And still applies. 









 I bought a $9 set of rabbit ears with a UHF loop on it, and an amplified antenna at WM for $49.95,  The amplified antenna can't pick up anything, but the rabbit ears let me pull in 6 channels, (4 of them PBS, ABC (analog), and CBS).  So what is the point of amplified indoor antennas when they don't pick up anything, and actually perform worse than a standard set of rabbit ears? 




 Probably a couple of hours.

 Not true at all.  I'm 32 years old, and I'll work doing anything.  "dreams" are for children.  The only thing that matters is keeping the lights on, a roof over my head, and food in my stomach.  Beyond that, I'm not picky what I do.

 I'm an area native.  I've lived in Whitman County all of my life.  So, yes.  I'm 32 years old. 




 god damn it.  That's what I get for smoking too much doobies in physics back when I was in HS. 




 When we lose, the streets are quiet, but when we win, College hill all fucking night long can be located by a blind man going to the sound of the "WOOO!  GO COUGS!"  (I've participated when I was really drunk, and even shot off fireworks.  The neighbors didn't like explosives too much, and the cops only told me to stop shooting off mortars, [after watching me light up the block for about 20 min]  {Yes, I have a lot of fireworks}.). :D  I shoot off fireworks because our football team sucks so much for the last 2 years, that ANY win is a good win, and mortars get launched, (which is why I probably have the cops called on me).

I'm going to put on a show after the town's 4th july display, Look to Maple Street, and you'll see a show. :)   IT'S LEGAL THAT DAY!!! :)  :) 




 When I was 12, I asked for a VCP for christmas, because I thought that VCR's were too expensive.  I got a $399 VCR anyhow. :)  Yes, I still use it, and you can still buy [blank tapes](http://www.walmart.com/ip/10980689?reviews_limit=9 ) from Walmart 




 12/23/10 just flashed before my eyes.  Pulling up to the intersection, and expecting to stop.  OH SHIT!!  NO BRAKES!!  BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP BEEEEEEEEEEEEP BEEEEEEEEEP!  I CAN"T STOP!  OH FUCK  DO I SIDESWIPE CARS?  NO!  NEUTRAL  NEUTRAL NEUTRAL!  dump clutch EEEEEEEEEE!  CLUNK!  no sound  OH FUCK! stop in the middle of the road XXX-XXX-XXXX Dad!  Emergency!  I need new brakes.  I just lost my brakes and almost killed a man!  TOW ME TO LES SCHWAB!"

That was a $7500 rebuild.  Nothing is more scary than trying to come to a stop normally, and **NOTHING HAPPENS**!  That's some scary shit!  O.o 




 I'd just be confused at that point, wondering why are they coming in here, and direct them to my neighbors.  They're the ones that do illegal shit not me.  Hell, the pizza guys can't even get the right house, so I don't blame you.  Tell you what.  I have keys to the electricity.  I'll shut them off for you.  (if you let me go back to bed).  Seriously, I do have access to the electric box, and if you let me sleep, I'll shut off their power for you. :) 




 I know that's very illegal, (at least in WA and ID), so I don't think anybody would be ballsy enough to impersonate a marked police vehicle, but undercovers?  That's easy.  Hell, I already look like a WSU maintenence vehicle, (from the dealership, I didn't get custom paint), minus the orange globe on top.  I can already drive basically wherever I want on WSU, so long as I abide by maintenance vehicle restrictions, it's not hard to get away with driving on "authorized vehicles and pedestrians only" roads, or on sidewalks, or up stairs, or anywhere I want to go.  

I've parked for HOURS directly across from the police department, and nobody cared.  No citations, no towing, nothing.  Not even a note.  I just drove like I was supposed to be there.  Of course, I used to work there, and am well aware of how maintenance vehicles are supposed to drive on "closed" roads, so abide by that, and no problems.  

Yes, I only did it when I had a good reason to, (wife was 8 months pregnant, and she can't walk up hills without risking falling over).  But without modifications, I can easily pass as a maintenance vehicle at WSU.  I even got Whitman County to drop a couple of "illegal parking" tickets, because I had a pregnant wife who couldn't walk more than 30 yards.  She had door to door service.  I drove anywhere I wanted, just abiding by the maintenance vehicle code.

Park outside the CUB for a couple hours?  Not a problem.  Drive down the chipman trail on WSU?  Not a problem.  I only got "illegal parking" when I using all the powers of dumbassery parked on the steps.  (people were in my way, so I couldn't park on level ground).  (yes, I know it wasn't very smart parking on stairs, because if my e-brake failed, it would cause at least 100 deaths, I got lectured by the judge on that one).  But as long as I wasn't dangerously parked, nobody cared at all, or even noticed my vehicle). 




 They work fine for me.  So yes, I do. 




 Yes.  If blue things are appearing red, you're approaching c, and you're going WAY TOO FAST!  (if the 60 mile radius around us survives, you'll get the highest ticket in history). 




 Cause I was 19 at the time, and had no clue (still don't), what they do with a road kill animal, (well, "almost-kill" [it was parylized when I saw it, so I shot it because it was suffering]).  I didn't want it, so I told them to give it to the battered women's shelter, (hey, they need meat), since I don't want it to go to waste.  Yes, I shot it, but from the front of the vehicle that collided with it, and the deer, it was obvious that I wasn't poaching.  I just had to unload, (not hard, it was a single shot), and give them the spent shell.  I kept my .410, and they sent me on my way.  I'll never forget that "conversation".  

"Did you see anything?"

"Yes.  I deer stumbling in the road, and a wrecked car.  These people pointing to the people looking on were in the car."

"Did you do anything?"

"Asked if they were OK.  They don't seem to need medical attention.  I shot the deer."

"I'm sorry, you did what?"

"I shot the deer.  It looked to be parylized.  I shot it in the head and put it out of it's misery.  The deer is over here".

"Sir, what did you shoot it with?  It seems to missing about a quarter of the left side of it's head."

"My SS .410"  The shell is over there"

"OK.  I'm going to need the shell you have loaded, and I need to inspect your weapon"

"OK"

...

"It seems everything checks out.  Do you wish to keep this animal?"

"No, give it to the battered women's shelter or something.  I don't want it.  I just didn't want it to suffer."

"Here is your shotgun.  Please do not load it, and have a good day sir."

 I flip a Uie, and go back to town 




 Personally, if somebody burst in here, the threat would be stopped, and you'll be chasing somebody neutralized.  (or not chasing him as the case may be).  Hopefully once he realized he had nowhere to run, or use force against, he would surrender and play "spider on the ground", but I'm prepared if I need to be, (legally, I don't violate the NFA, or any state statutes).  If all I have to yell is "HEY!" and they run off, good!

Shit, now the police reaction to me pulling up to WaMu to have my wife get money out of the ATM makes sense.  I pulled up, and I saw several patrol vehicles there, and didn't think anything of it.  Wife got out of the car, and I was sitting in the seat smoking.  Officer walks by and asks what I'm doing, so I told him, "my wife wants some cash from the ATM and she's right there", [literally right in front of me].

He told me to stay in the vehicle, and walked off carrying an AR in a 1pt sling in low ready.  I don't know where the hell he was going, but he seemed like he was on a mission.  Yes, I stayed in the vehicle.  I didn't really think much of it beyond "this is odd".  To this day, I still don't even know what the hell I rolled up on.  The bank was closed, so it couldn't have been a bank robbery.  Training thing maybe?  That's the only thing I can think of.

 




 Just a normal cop car without lights?  Doesn't make me nervous, I've just never seen one before besides earlier today.  I thought it was strange.  I was airing up my tires, and saw it pass by.  It looked strange to me, since I expect cop cars to have a light bar like ambulances or fire trucks.  Emergency vehicles = lightbar, as far as I'm concerned.  I saw one without one, so I wondered why that car exists, (since I never saw one before).  It made me look twice.  I didn't think much of it beyond "Hmm, weird.  33 lbs, 35 lbs .... 50 lbs... OH SHIT!  Pfffffffffff. 44 lbs.  Cool.  On to the next tire." 




 OK, that explains why you carry SMG's. :)  What do you do if you come across people sleeping who don't know what the hell is going on, and don't even know who you are?  Yeah, I assume you announce "XXX County Sheriff", but what if they are like "OK, why are you here?" and they honestly have no idea why you're there, because they weren't doing anything besides sleeping?  I guess what I'm asking is "what if you get the wrong house?"  Or what if you do have the wrong house, you burst in, and you hear "WHO'S IN MY HOUSE!?  I'M ARMED!  LEAVE NOW!! I'M CALLING 911!" 




 I don't like the slick top rigs because I could EASILY do that myself (if I had enough money).  I drive a crimson and grey 97 Blazer LT, and it looks enough like a WSU rig that I get no shit if I drive on "authorized vehicles only" roads up at WSU.  I've parked for a couple hours, and locked my rig, and nobody touched it, or ticketed me, or even left me a note.  I look like a normal WSU maintenance vehicle minus the orange globe on top.  I've done nothing special to my rig beyond "buy it from the dealer", but I can pass as a WSU maintenance vehicle, when I'm directly parked across the street from the police department.

The only thing visually seperating me from a WSU Police vehicle?  No light bar, no large aerials, no state plates, and no push bar.  The only thing separating me from a maintenance vehicle?  No orange orb.  But if I wanted all of that shit, if I had about $3000, nobody would be able to tell the difference, (besides the logos of the local police).  [That's not too hard to get](http://www.decaldriveway.com/) if I wanted to.

Just knowing how easy it would be to impersonate a police officer if if I felt so inclined, (NO I DON'T!), and just a normal passenger vehicle can be easily passed off as a maintenance vehicle makes me have reservations about unmarked vehicles.  Hell, I don't even need an orange globe to drive wherever I want on WSU campus, I just have to drive like I work there, and am on official business, (less than 15 MPH at all times, and when pedestrians are present, less than 5 MPH).  Of course, it does help that I used to work there in maintenance, so I know the procedures for driving on "Pedestrian Only:  Closed to traffic except for authorized vehicles" road.

Also, the one time I got pulled over for jumping a red, (didn't run it, jumped it, (treated it as a 4 way, and went for it), I actually purposly went to the center lane, turned on my 4 ways, and drove to the nearest gas station and parked under the fueling area.  I didn't see him, so I didn't know who was trying to pull me over.  I made sure that the stop was on video tape, because I didn't know who was stopping me or why.  (I fucked up, and jumped the red), and got let go).  [not doing that again, and the officer gave me a good reason why]  "What if I was trying to get on to the road?  You obviously didn't see me, so what else could you have missed?"  Want to kill somebody today?"  I had no answer for that, and I don't jump reds anymore. 




 But what do you use them for?  I carry a sidearm on my person, (so I don't get killed if somebody shoots at me, at least I'll have a fighting chance), and a .410 in case I come across road almost-kill, (I've had to use it before), but why an MP5?  Do you have to do residential breeches or something?  Surely it's not to send roadkill to meet it's maker?  Yeah, if somebody's shooting at you, I fully expect you to shoot back, but why a SMG?  What do you use them for?  (yay for WA, they let you keep roadkill if you want it).  No, I didn't keep it, I told the officer to give it to the battered women's shelter or whatever they do with it.  I only shot it because it was going to die anyways, and I didn't want it to suffer.  My only word to the deer was "sorry".  BANG!  (after I distracted the kids at the scene by having them look at the "pretty mountain, isn't it pretty how all that snow is up there?  Just think about sledding.") 




 *cough* only the asians, and the seattleites. *cough*  If it snows 2", expect numerous slide offs, and drive EXTREMELY defensively.  (sign says 35, go 30.  Sign says 55, go 45).  Seattleites can't drive worth shit.  Empty roads, and shit conditions?  I actually obey the speed limit. (unless it's foggy, I've went 20 in a 55 before, because I couldn't see 10 feet in front of me, and assholes wouldn't pass, and lined up behind me because I was "making way".  I could barely see where I was going), and still almost got into a head-on.  I found myself in the center lane before a car passed me in the opposite direction, and wondered "why is that car so close to me?"  I had drifted over to the center turn lane, and had it not been for the rumble strips, a very bad accident would have happened that night.  That was scary.  I should have just stopped. 




 They have submachine guns?  Shit, no wonder why the officer was watching exactly what I was doing when I said "Hey, can I sit behind the wheel?"  His response was "Uhh, sure, just don't start it."  WTF do you need an Uzi for?  AR15's I can understand, (what if you're in a shooting, and you need to "reach out and touch somebody"?  But SMG?  What the hell for?  (honest question). 




 SWAT uses patrol cars?  I thought they used those converted APC's?  I've sat behind the wheel of one, (no they wouldn't let me even fire it up), and it was cool, but from the "test" I did on the seat, (bouncing up and down on it), I wouldn't want to drive that fucker.  It felt like a really shitty grain truck with bad seat springs. (just sitting behind the wheel and looking around the cab seeing what lacks).  They don't even have an AM radio in that thing!  That rig must be boring to drive. (and hell on your ass). 




 Do drivers recognize that you're a patrol vehicle when you light them up, or think you're some asshole pranking as a cop so they pull over so assumed asshole can blow by them at highway speeds?  (serious question)  

If I got stopped by one of those "concealed light" rigs, I would slow down, call 911, turn on my 4 ways, and proceed to the nearest well lit area before stopping.  No light bar on top?  I'm not stopping.  How do I know you're not some dickhole who likes making people shit a brick for no reason?  

In my book, cop cars have lights on the top.  Concealed bars are about one step above some random driver trying to get me to stop for I don't know why.  Undercover vehicles?  (no markings), I'm going to pull over in a well lit area, where there are plenty of witnesses, and I'm calling 911.  Any joe schmoe on the internet can buy red and blues if he wants, and sirens aren't that hard to obtain either.  All you need is [internet access](http://www.thefirestore.com/store/category.aspx/categoryId/528/Emergency-Lights-and-Sirens/).  I don't trust unmarked vehicles. 




 There's a guy that drives one of those, but his is painted all white.    He doesn't have ariels, or state plates, and has holes where the push bar used to be.  I know that guy, and he just uses it as a daily commute vehicle.  But for some reason, they left the spotlights on it instead of carrying a spotlight in their vehicle like a normal person. He lives up at CCN.  I've pulled him out of the ditch a couple of times, because he drives like shit. 




 Painted dark blue, and it says "Pullman Police Department" on the side, and gives the business number?  Wouldn't that be VERY illegal?  It was identical to this car, but no lightbar on top.

 that would be 34984. 




 In your house. 




 Yes, it is. It's also known as the Doppler effect. 




 I regularly did 1600 SPH, and 5.5 SPI. 




 Bad enough that I had to speed to a station in town, and couldn't make it to the doors, so I stopped as soon as I got off of the street, and pissed right there in front of god and everybody. I simply couldn't hold it any longer. I was starting to piss in my driver's seat. 




 Evolution. 




 That's what the bin next to the quarters are for. 




 You could leave your house unlocked, and windows open while you sleep, and wouldn't worry about getting robbed.

You could leave your windows down, keys in the ignition, and truck running while going into the store for a little bit, and not worry if your rig will still be there when you get out. The most that would happen is somebody might turn your ignition off, figuring you forgot about it.

If you broke down along the road, people would actually stop and see if they could help you, instead of just driving by and pretending they didn't see you.

Children were expected to behave, and bad behavior in public settings such as restaurants and stores was not tolerated by either the general public, or the parents.

Children could go to the store, or park without parental escort; and nobody thought twice about a child unattended taking a city bus. CPS didn't get involved because you let your children have some independence.

If it was during school hours, and children were seen roaming the street, it wasn't uncommon to ask them "Shouldn't you be in school?" or "Do you need a ride to school?"

If children missed the bus to school, they were expected to walk, (or take their bike), to school; not call mommy and daddy at work to get a ride.

Perpetual victimhood was frowned upon. Yeah, you got a raw deal. Everybody has something to bitch about. Life isn't fair, get used to it.

No participation trophies. You deserve praise because you accomplished something, or went above and beyond the call of duty. Not simply because you breathe free air. 

In the game of life, there are winners and losers. Regardless how hard you try, you still may not succeed. You didn't win. Sorry, you lost. Yes, you may have tried. That doesn't make you a "winner in your heart", you are still a loser in the game of life, but at least you lost with dignity.

Please and thank you were common, and expected. It used to be considered common courtesy to hold open a door for the elderly, ladies, infirmed, people in a rush, and people carrying things. 

Also offering them a buggy, or taking it back into the store for them used to be a kind gesture that wasn't expected.  It was polite, not "rude", "demeaning", or "mysoganist".

People had a sense of community, and you knew your neighbors, and they knew you. You could ask them for help, and they could of you too. It might be as simple as, "hey, I'm going on vacation for a week, can you water my lawn?" Or something like "I just bought a new couch, and I need help getting it out of my truck. Can you help?". People were glad to help.

Fortunately, I still live in one of these areas. All of America should be like this. 




 The holey buy-bull and Kent Hovind said so. 




 Not really, there's people obsessed with exercise.  Exercise isn't a drug. 




 They are drugs.

*"a medicine or other substance (which is not food or water), which has a physiological effect when ingested or otherwise introduced into the body."* 




 Good reasons. :)  I'm happy with my VCR.  It works fine for me. 




 I have my DTV box feeding into my VCR, and from there, into my TV.  It works fine for my purposes. 




 That explains it.  Thanks!  I saw it driving by today while I was airing up my tires, and I thought it was strange, so I asked here why those cars exist.  To quote NBC:  "The More You Know..." :) 




 I was a teen when it first came out.  I stopped watching it after a dude was forced to give a BJ, and chomped the dudes dick off, then spit it in his face.  I decided I didn't want to see that, so I changed the channel, (Sat G5, T15, C-Band).  

It's worth watching as an adult, but not for kids.  The pacific is gory, but it's good. :)  I have all 3 series on my computer.  Hell, I have enough video on my computer I could run a TV station. 




 So it's just a normal police car?  Do they even have lights?  I was airing up my tires today and one drove by.  It looked like the FD car, but had the police paint on it.  I thought it was strange. 




 Ah.  So that's like the boss's company car?   














 The liberal media lies, and presents a view point that bolsters thier POV without regards to the facts of the case. 




 What ever happened to just using a VCR?  (serious question)  Walmart still sells blank tapes.  http://www.walmart.com/ip/10980689?reviews_limit=9  




 Band of Brothers is good.  Have you watched The Pacific yet?  That's good too.  So is Oz. 




 Well shit.  There's not much there that I would actually bother watching.  :(  Fuck, I hate the DTV conversion. :(  I used to get 13 channels with an indoor antenna. :( 














 To the East, there are several mountains in the way, (over 4500 feet high).  To the north, there is a change in elevation of a thousand feet, and down in the LC valley where channel 3 is, is a fall of about 2000 feet.  There are basically no broadcast towers to the west of me.

Is it possible to convert a direcTV dish to FreeSat?  Or would I need to put in a new dish?  And if I did this, would I be able to get american TV like ABC, CBS, NBC, PBS, Fox, UPN, CW? 




 Shit. Even if I could put up a radio tower of 500 feet, I still wouldn't be able to pick up much.:

  If you do the math, there's plenty of time to be enrolled FT, and work FT.  There are 168 hours in a week.

    12 hours of class
    12 hours of study
    40 hours to work
    56 hours to sleep
    10 hours to eat
    3 hours to keep house
    14 hours to relax
    Total hours used per week:  147
    Total hours per week: 168
    Total hours left unused:  21

That gives you 21 hours to socialize.  If you do this, not only will you pass, but you won't have a damned bit of debt when you graduate, and will still have time to make friends.

 Yes, he did.

*"In television, we're attempting first to make better utilization of the bandwidth, because we think we can eventually get in excess of 2000 lines instead of 525 ... and do it on an even narrower channel ... which will make for a much sharper picture. We believe in the picture-frame type of a picture, where the visual display will be just a screen. And we hope for a memory, so that the picture will be just as though it's pasted on there."*

 I've never actually seen somebody, (kid, or otherwise), write a backwards E, S, or R, (unless they were purposely doing it).  But that explains it. :)

 There's a difference between towing them out of the ditch because they couldn't handle the road (driving reasonably), or because the snow was too deep to ford in the vehicle, (been there, done that); versus hiring a lawyer for them to fight a speeding ticket, so they don't have to pay more for insurance.  They got the ticket, they pay it.  And since they're paying their own insurance anyways, they'll learn rather quickly not to speed.

What the fuck?  And just a look will send you into shaking and trembling and cowering in the corner of the cab at 60 MPH to get away from her if she decides to hit you?  And she does the "mom count to 3" Really?  Then she thinks you were prank calling her the night before, so she beats you almost senseless when you're crying and begging her to stop, and your man cousin pulls her off because you're getting your ass kicked, and crying?  You can't recognize that as abusive?  What the hell is wrong with you?

**EDIT:** Yes, I know, /r/oddlyspecific  It got bad enough, that in my Senior year, I always had a tape recorder and video recorder on me.

 That seems like as good of an explanation of any, but I still don't get it.  Why not "FTW", and just stay out of relationships because "you know" it's going to end bad, so why bother even trying?

 What's it say for if you put up an aerial? 




 By that logic, I could have "faith" in The Enterprise Project, and believe that NASA is really suppressing evidence of ancient martian civilisations.  Yes, there's more evidence for that than of any god. 




 Why believe in what you have no direct and reproducible evidence for though?  I "believe" in what can be tested and confirmed.  My stance on God is about that as Glesie 581D having sapient species, (or any species of life at all).  Could there be?  Sure.  But sine we can't observe, monitor, or test for it, and it has no affect on anything, it's a mute point whether god or aliens exist.  The undetectable is indistinguishable from the non-existent. 




 Then what created god?  If you say "god always existed", then why can't that exact same argument apply to the universe its self?  As far as "where you go when you die", Most people get entombed in the Earth, others are cremated, and others are left to rot in the woods.  "you" go nowhere.  You simply stop existing.   




 The Mohu Leaf didn't do shit for me, but a cheapo RCA antenna gets me 6 channels.  Have you looked up your TV Fool report?

[I smoke Two Joints.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUsv4Lb7EQs) 




 Nope, I smoke dope maybe once a year.  MJ has basically nothing to do with anything.  The longest I've spent high is a week back in 2005.  I wass **VERY** baked then.  I decided to stop because I was just too damned high.  I "took a break" lasting over 4 years because "I can't do this anymore".  I was so damned high, that I just had to stop because I couldn't know what was real or not, so I put the bong down, and "back to life, back to realty" was the hit song that 5 days of sobering up.

 




 Do you like it when your daddy touches you, and says "it's god's will"? 




 Ask my SIL about how much I blab when I'm high.  The last time I smoked dope, I was blabbing away for 8 hours, and wouldn't shut up.  I got hit twice because I wouldn't shut the hell up.  I can't even recall what the hell I was talking about, but I woke up with a sore head, and an inflamed cheek because I wouldn't shut the fuck up. 




 There's a difference between the Catholics and the Pentecostals/Mormoms/Baptists.  Catholics, you have to go to, Mormons they seek you out like they are on a mission.  I guess that's why the call them missionaries, 




 You mean like the modern Catholics?  Well, if you want to see what they're about, go to church and ask the Father questions.  He'll be more than happy to talk to you if you want.  I don't like Mormons, the Baptists, and Pentecostals and Jehovah's Witnesses because of the active indoctrination involved.  But if you go seek out the knowledge yourself out of curiosity, (or whatever), then more power to you.  You walked in there, you are free to walk away. 




 Try and sell a sober 30 year old man on religion.  Whether it's Mormonism, or Zoroastrianism will make no difference.  The man will spot it for the bullshit that it is, and might fuck with the 19 year old kids trying to sell the religion for a while, but eventually, he's going to tell them to fuck off and get of of his land. 




 For the same reason you're so gullible. 




 Religion/faith = Belief in something without any evidence to prove it.  Whether it's fung shui, or Christianity, or "healing crystals", matter not. 




 I respect the Mafia and the Hell's Angels because of "influence", and I can prove that they exist.  A simple call on my telephone will prove it.  They exist, and sell drugs, guns, and ride motorbikes.  They also kill people, but if you don't fuck with them, the most you'll see them is driving down the road and lie to your wife "I guess there's a harley convention in town" while you know exactly while there's so many motorbikes on the road.

Also, Hitler was FAR from conquering the world.  HE fucked up by having a 3 front fight, and allying with Japan.  Getting attacked by England, USSR, USA, France, never goes well for you. 




 But if everything is "god's will", how can humans have free will?  Similarly, if humans have free will, how can anything be "god's plan"? 




 Yeah!  Bronze age goat herders who lived in caves and huts have all the answers to life!  What's your shirt made out of BTW?  Can I see your bat that is a bird? 




 History shows that "conversion at the point of a sword" is the most effective.  Look at the Christianization of Europe 1200 years ago, or Islam today.  "Convert or die" is very effective. 




 N/P, the instant they shut up about their god(s), and stop blabbing how I'm going to hell because I am a human and am using the brain that "god gave me". 




 Yeah, an "all seeing, all knowing and all caring" being made Adam an Eve, and forbid humans to eat of the tree of knowledge.  That flies about as well as a Led Zepplin.  Oh wait, worse.  That was actually a very successful band.  Tell me again why God allowed 9/11 to happen?
 




 Not always [Yes, there are atheists in foxholes](http://militaryatheists.org/atheists-in-foxholes/). 




 Sure you can.  Old code.  "Don't look for shit and fuck with people, but defend yourself".  Easy. 




 There is no such thing as a "democrat child", or a "republican child".  Why are there "muslim children", and "Christian children", and "Catholic Children?  If you can't back up your claim with evidence, your ideas deserve no respect.
 




 I'll shut up about atheism, the instant that the religious shut up about their god. 



















 Hey, gotta recruit and train!  The NFL drafts just happened. 




 You mean "recruits people", so they give them more money, and provide no tangible benefit in return? 




 Would you respect the idea that all the space jews stole the Moon money, and that's why the Lunar race had to sell off it's atmosphere?  Of course not.  No evidence for that ridiculous claim.  Religion is no different.  Why can't you respect my "belief" that the space jews did steal all the moon money? 




 They were likely indoctrinated as children.

 There are no religious dead people. 




 Only when I smoke dope, then I can't stop talking. :) 




 There's a difference between offering a service that can be used as needed, (hey you know where they are), for people in genuine need of such services; versus selling "You're a horrible person, and deserve to not only die in a fire, but burn for all of eternity. but if you accept insert god or godhead here, you get to go to heaven after you die!  Yeah your life sucks, but the afterlife will be so much better!"

**EDIT:**  "Addiction counseling" is a sham designed to get people into the religion of AA.  Instead of 12 steps, (only which the first one has anything to do with insert drug, there should be two steps.  

* Step 1:  "Stop doing drugs".  
* Step 2:  See step 1.

 I've only done it with text on IM, and intro'ed songs to people on FB. I know how to introduce a song, and start up a playlist, but I think I sound strange even on a PA system at walmart. (where I used to work). I have no idea how I sound recorded, it's been over 25 years since I've taped myself. (I was a kid with a tape recorder).

I've DXed for about half of my life, and can build AM and FM reception antennas with no problems.  I used to use a CB in the grain truck when I was growing up, (and a couple of times after I became an adult to report emergencies using channels 3 and 9)  Other than that, I have no experience on the air.  All I know about it is "don't cuss, and ID yourself every 15 minutes of broadcast, and you can't play music on CB frequencies".

I don't think terrestrial radio is ever going to die.  Sat radio is about $10/mo, and not worth it IMHO. AM/FM is free, and you might have a lot of crappy stations, but you do get a couple of good ones that are worth listening to.

I want to work for a classic rock station.  I don't think I would do too well in a pop music station.  "and here's some more teeny-bopper crap for the 11 year olds".  Yeah, I don't think that would fly too well.  Give me Led Zeppelin, Twisted Sister, Black Sabbath, Pink Floyd, and Iron Maiden. Hell, throw in some AC/DC and Metallica for good measure. :)  I would rock their socks off. :)

I know I couldn't be the AM Radio KQQQ morning news guy, (I can't talk that long), but on 100.5FM, I could do it, (but I would have to watch my mouth so I don't get fined by the FCC).

 The issue I have, is what the hell do I tie off to?  There's nothing up there to tie off on, and I'm a single man, so I can't exactly bailey myself.  I don't really feel like falling 40 feet to my death. 




 Well, got the compass.  Now I just have to figure out how to get up there.  Is paracord strong enough to keep me from falling to my death if I slip?  I know it's 550# test, but F=MA.  From my math, I could fall half a meter before the cord snaps, (with no air resistance).  I know the TV of a human is around 192 km/h (with air resistance, or there would be no TV).  Here's a picture of the front of my house:

http://i.imgur.com/TPQEY8d.png 




 Well, I just got permission from my LL to install an antenna on the roof if I want.  Now I just have to figure out how the hell to get up there.  I called walmart, they won't rent out the manlift that they have.  Sun Rental will, but it's 100 per day.  A 35 foot ladder is $60/day.  But for that price, I could just buy one.

How safe would it be to get up on the roof without a ladder, by just going out the window, and tying off with paracord?  Speaking of which, I need to go buy a compass, so I have degree measurements. 




 It makes no difference whether 1 person has 99 dollars, and the rest have 1 between them.  GDP is GDP.  And yes, I know what GDP is.  Gross Domestic Product.  The sum total of the economy.  Who cares if the other 99 people are worse off?  If they want more of that money, they should get a job from the dude who has the money.  Like the saying goes.  "He who has the gold, makes the rules".

And no, I didn't get it from Faux News, (I don't even know what channel it's on), or Limbaugh.  I stopped listening to that blowhard back in 2005.  I got that conclusion from the OWS crowd where they want to "eat the rich", and "spread the wealth around".  They're complaining about being poor, but they have iPhones, and Macbook Airs.  Yeah, "poor".  My white ass.  If they're poor and can afford that shit, (more likely their parents bought it for them), then the Pope is middle-class.  The OWS crowd should be forcibly removed for the squatters and vagrants that they are.  Fortunately, I live in a city where we still enforce the vagrancy laws. 




 Yeah, a rocket mount.  The track would just slow it down.  But what if somebody fit a rocket car with super slick skis?  Would that even work?  And if so, what would stop them from taking off like an aeroplane?

 Here you go:  Direct from MS; [build 10130](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/preview-iso). 




 Well, that explains why I can sometimes DX radio stations as far away as Nebraska, and picking up KGO at night isn't exactly hard.  Hell, I can pick it up with my walkman, and no large ferrite antenna. 














 A) Money is money.  "equal distribution" makes no sense.  Why should a walmart greeter make as much as a doctor?  Are you that daft?  Fuck.  Cripples and idiots can be a walmart greeter.

B)  Yes, American politics are fucking dumb.  No argument there.  We have a 2 party system.  Like it or not, reality is what it is.  No amount of dreaming, or jerking off in your bed at night to fantasize about the Constitution or Green party will make any difference. 




 Have you tried upgrading from an ISO?  On my desktop, I'm on build 10135. 




 I've wondered this too. Back in the 90's when I only had antenna service, I actually hoped for shitty weather because that was the only time I could pick up Fox. I missed the finale of ST:V because we had good weather that day. I was pissed off for 2 weeks.

Anyhow, from what I remember from TV DX magazine, bad weather is often accompanied by low atmospheric pressure and low(er) surface temperatures. This allows the TV signal to bounce off of the ionosphere, and come to your antenna. 

To test this hypothesis, you could go out with your garden hose and spray your antenna. Try it both at night, and during the day at the height of heat. That will see if water has anything to do with your reception. 




 Yep. That's right. I actually have that entire series stored on my computer.  Hell, I have enough media that I could run a TV station if I had a transmission tower. (And if I could legally set up an NTSC broadcast). 




 The 100 people having 100 dollars are exactly as rich as the 10 people having 100 dollars. Wealth isn't increased or decreased because of how many people that have it.

And how am I wrong about the Democratic party? That basically is their stance. They feed off of jealousy and envy. 




 He did in 1990. Well, to his childhood home. Then he went to Vietnam, and saved his brother from getting killed by that VC chick. 




 Having a job. Both hand and blow. 




 Quantum Leap. 









 I could have, but when I lived 16 miles from the nearest town with over a thousand people, and 4.6 miles outside of a town with only 120 people, (and have to go to school on a bus trip taking over an hour), it's kind of impossible.  

You have work to do on the ranch, and have no time to "blow" before school.  After school, you feed the animals, so cleanup around the ranch, and watch TV.  I could have if I wanted, but I honestly had no time for trivial pursuits in social engagement.

How has it affected me?  Well, I finally got really high and got laid at 27 years old.  I got her pregnant so we got married.  We had a son.  2 years later in 2012, she wanted another kid.  I fucked her without a condom and got her pregnant.  Wife left, kids lost.  Reality sucks.  I'm never dating again, and I'm 32 years old.  It's simply not worth my time to ever try dating again. 




 Can you imagine it launched today?  What would Sam Beckett do on 9/11, or 7/7?  How would he have handled the massive power out in NE during 2003?  How about the killing of Princess Diana in 97?  The fall of the Berlin Wall, and the collapse of the Soviet Union?  The OKC bombing?  The Y2K transition, when that was the last time humans weren't in space at all?  Don't forget about Iran Contra, and the Panamanian conflict.  Iraq because of oil, 10 years later, back to Iraq.  Color TV, and NTSC transition.  Antennas die, and resurrected again.  People getting off of cable, and putting up aerials and watching videos online.  14.4Kbps, 33.6Kbps, 56K, BROADBAND!  C-band satellite, Ku-satellite, Wild feeds, DBS, Cable, back to antenna again!  Planes wrecked, monuments destroyed, war again. "Depends on that the meaning of "is" is".  Entitlists, unemployment, economy died, economy "revived".  Housing collapse, market rebuilding, economy is still stagnant.  We didn't start the fire! It was always burning, Since the world's been turning. We didn't start the fire. No we didn't light it, But we tried to fight it!

OK, before I become Billy Joel and start writing Lyrics for "We Didn't Start the Fire, (2015)", I'll stop now. :D 




 A 1977 Chevrolet Impala Coupe.  It cost all of $100, and was a POS, but it was **MY** POS.  As far as recommendations?  Something large.  More mass will protect you.  Look at 70's impalas, and Lincoln Town Cars. 




 Had friends to hang out at the river and go fishing with.  Also, jump off of Granite Point. 




 Quantum Leap. 




 The only advice I have is if you move to a location where you cannot receive service (clear view of the southern sky), then they'll let you out without any consequences.  Much like how to get out of a cellphone contract.  Or, wait until they send you a "user member agreement" update, and disagree with a clause.  You have 30 days to bail without any consequences.

**TL;DR:**  Move to where you can't get service; or review the revised member agreement when you get one in the mail, and find something to disagree with. 




 Fuck per capita.  GDP is what matters.  "Everybody is Equal" in the congo, where they have to burn buffalo and Elephant dung to cook their food.  Equality isn't a virtue, it's a pox on the development of a modern society.  Liberals want to make "everybody equal" by bringing everyone down to the lowest common denominator, instead of raising up the poor to be comfortable.  "be successful, but not too much", should be the democratic party's slogan.  At least then they would be honest. 




 I have no problem with infrastructure maintenance and improvements.  We have to keep the lights on, the water flowing, trash service running, and the roads passable.  Funding of education is also needed, as an educated populace is crucial to maintaining a free society.  

Lack of education leads to Somalia and Afghanistan.  I have no problems with spending money on education, but quite a lot of that money is wasted on overhead and union dues, and paying lawyers.  It should be going to the children's direct benefit, not the NEA and SEIU. 




 "going to shit"  Yeah, that's why we have the highest GDP on the entire planet. Even the Chinese can't hold a candle to us. 




 Why should I care about people who I will never see, or hear from beyond commercials on TV begging for money, or on the news about the earthquake about destroyed buildings and impassable roads?  It doesn't affect me, so it's not my concern. 




 You're the one that thinks you're liberal utopia doesn't allow cousin marriages.  Here's news to you:  They do.  In NJ, incest has actually been decriminalized between consenting adults. 




 How do I mount the pole to the roof?  Back in the 90's, I just turned my room into a giant antenna, and that worked fine.  But I'm not sure that will even work with the new ATSC standard.  I've never really set up a rooftop aerial before. 




 All children are bums.  They contribute nothing to the economy, and are economic drains on society. 




 I don't give a shit about other people.  I'm not them, and I won't ever meet them.  Why should I care about starving kids in Nepal, and wrecked houses?  I'm not there.  It doesn't affect me, (and never will). 




 Oh, and the "progressive" states, are where cousin marriage is legal.  You can marry your first cousin in NY, MA, NJ, MD, CO, and CA. (and other states)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cousin_marriage_law_in_the_United_States_by_state 




 I rock out, watch TV, smoke pot, and drink beer in my off time.  It's cheap entertainment. 




 Yes, like this lady.  Gotta get your Obama Phone!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpAOwJvTOio 




 Have fun being "worldly", and crying over TV commercials about starving kids in Nepal saying "so sad", but not doing a damned thing to change it. 




 I actually grew up upper-middle income.  My father was making upwards of $75000 a year in the 90's.  I make less than $20,000 a year, and honestly doubt I'll make anywhere close to what my father made, (let alone adjusted for inflation).  Dreams and fantasies are useless.  They are like masturbation.  They make you feel good, but accomplish nothing. 




 Yeah, a real world where people want their obama phones.  If you can't afford a phone (really?  for $8/mo, you can get 250m a month with unlimited texting), maybe you shouldn't have one.  Use payphones, or get a landline.  Cellular phones are a luxury, and not needed. 




 No shit.  I was 8 at the time.  It was funded by my parents. 




 Of course the national leaders (and the uber rich), get a higher standard of care than joe blow off of the street.  They have the money to afford it, so they can buy it.  Just like in a car, you can buy the $0.50 sparkplugs, and no-name oil, or you can buy the $7 (each spark plugs coated in platinum, with "triple fire technology", and synthetic oil.  With more money, comes more choice in what you can afford.  

Should everybody be forced to drive a 18 year old truck that leaks coolant, just because I do?  Or should I be able to get a Jaguar becaus some rich people buy them?  Of course not.  There is a different vehicle and different levels of services for people of different income levels.  Healthcare isn't much different.

I did watch the video, and he stated his points well.  However, he neglected the one reason that US healthcare is more expensive.  Namely, R D costs, and the patent system.  In countries such as the UK or Australia, the government holds the exclusive patent rights to the medications and medical technology, and it is shared immediately.  In the USA, there is a 7 year patent, and generics are prohibited during that time.

If it was a work related activity, that meets the requirements in WA to qualify as "work search".  However, when you are unemployed, there is no such thing as "vacation days".  Sure, you can sit on your ass on the weekend, but you are expected to make an active search for work.  When I was a maintenance man, I had vacation time, but never used it.  I had over 168 hours of banked up vacation time that I refused to use.  Upon separation of employment, I got a "free" month of pay in addition to unemployment.  I don't believe in taking vacations.

And if I was a "captain of industry" like you seem to like that term, I would be smoking Cuban cigars on my yacht, and have a runabout in my yacht so I could make it to shore.  My "runabout" would be a 32 foot boat, and I would have a skip on that if I wanted to go into an area where there are no docks.  That would be a "captain of industry".

We actually have no "trade" schools within 31 miles.  The one 50 miles away, (WWCC), churns out nurses, and CNA's and tech support people.  Nothing else is offered.  I could cross state lines and pay $8000/semester, but incurring $32,000 of debt just to get a $30,000 job still is a wash at best.  There is no point to getting a degree that doesn't pay off in a maximum of 2 years, (and be debt free).  

he strange thing is, the one school, (LCSC), that I could attend a trade school to be a diesel technician, or a welder, or a plumber, (or whatever), is actually closer to me (28 miles), than the nearest in-state  trade school.  After that, it's a 78 mile one way trip to SFCC.  Can you tell I live basically in the middle of nowhere?

Trade schools do have their place, as they teach practical skills that generate income.  However, the "general studies", or "Major in philosophy, minor in Arabic" degrees are completely useless.  Being "well rounded" doesn't matter for shit if you get several tens of thousands of dollars in debt, and work at starbucks or drive a taxi.  That was just a waste of money.  They would have been economically better off if they had just never went to school in the first place.

[Have Degree?  Will Drive Cab!](http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2013-06-25/why-are-so-many-college-graduates-driving-taxis-)

 




 I was born in 1983.  I remember that conflict.  We crushed them within 3 weeks, they torched the oil wells, and fled back into Iraq.  We stopped half way to Baghdad, because GHWB pulled out.  That was pointless.  We should have just crushed Soddomy Insane back in 91. 




 In Europe, there is a benefit to being multi-lingual.  But in the USA, there's really no point.  There aren't many mexicans in Whitman County, and the Chinese people mostly keep to themselves.  English is the primary language of the USA, and there really is no need to know any other language beyond English. 




 That was in the 80's.  I was thinking more along the lines of the bombing of 10 downing street in 1991.  Such a peaceful country, the UK.  Oh, don't forget about the Protestant/Catholic conflicts. 




 "Worst performing"  Yeah, right.  DPRK and Cuba beg to differ.  Where do all the world leaders come to get advanced medical care?  Oh, that's right.  The USA.  They don't go to France or Indonesia.

Also, I did it exactly once because I needed food.  I hardly made a living at it.  And one hour for $50 of food is almost like I got paid to sit through the rambling nonsense of the preacher.  "food from god"  Yeah, right.  it's food from people who saw fit to donate to a cause that they supported, (feeding the needy).  "God" had nothing to do with it, any more than he does with the turds coming out of a cow's asshole while it eats on the range.

And if you were traveling the world, you weren't exactly "available for work each and every day", were you?  That is a requirement to collect unemployment.  You also have to make a minimum of 3 contacts per week, and actively look for work.  I'm fully aware of WA State requirements for collecting unemployment insurance.

Once again, I spent one hour there, and got "paid" for my time by food.  Pretty good deal.  Considering I can live easily on less than $100/mo by myself, and with my wife and daughter, I can keep it under $150/mo.  It's not exactly hard to eat on a tight budget, but eating out is a luxury that only happens about once a season.  (just like it used to be when I grew up).

Define "learn something useful".  If you mean Medieval History of Europe, or XXX studies, or philosophy, I consider those useless pursuits.  If it's not a tangible skill, I have no interest in learning it.  If it can't generate income, there is no purpose to learning it.  I do not care about "being well rounded".  I care about putting money in my pocket, and nothing else.  Also, the last I checked, school doesn't pay you to be there.  Internships are full of shit, and an excuse for free labor.   




 The last war we explicitly fought for oil was Iraq in the early 90's, after Soddomy Insane invaded Kuwait.   Also, we don't get most of our oil from the ME.  We get it from USA, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, and then Saudi Arabia.  

However, because we are now fracking, we could cut out Saudi oil, and it wouldn't really affect us.  In case you haven't checked, the world petroleum market is an international commodity.  You likely get fuel from Saudi Arabia too.

As far as domestic oil production, yes it is.  Maybe you've heard of Standard Oil?  They were broken up in 1911.  We now have Exxon, Shell, Chevron, Tesoro, etc.  All private industries. 




 Nope, we didn't directly fund them.  We directly funded the Mujahadeen which later became the Taliban and Al Qaeda.  We wanted to fuck with the USSR, and didn't really give a shit about the UK. 




 And I don't have the time for the Clinton/Sanders supporters.  Hillary is about as transparent as the walls of my house, and Sanders is a self-admitted socialist.  Democrats claim they want you to be successful, just not "too successful".  If Bill Gates wanted to pile up all his money, and create the world's biggest bonfire, he could.  If he wants to blow it on penny candy, or hookers and blow, he can.  He earned the money, he can do whatever he likes with it.  It's his money, not yours. 




 No shit we spend the most on education.  You can thank the NEA for that.  So obviously the solution isn't "throw more money at it".  I honestly think we should adopt Germany's way of doing it.  Have an academic track, and a blue-collar track.  Homogenized ANYTHING never works.  

People learn differently, and should be targeted with a curriculum that suits them, not what the NEA says everybody needs.  What use does a future plumber or welder have for French or Japanese?  Similarly, what use does a future accountant have for shop classes?  This is one lesson from Europe that the USA should take.  The Germans do it better, so we should do what China is so famous for, and copy them.

And fifth grade?  I could easily pass that.  Unless being multi-lingual is a requirement.  But if the classes were taught in English, not a problem. 




 Five times more?  Yeah right.  $20 for a checkup?  Sure, if it was 1995.  Here in the 21st century, we have to pay for services rendered.  If you think about it, a doctor's visit is actually still cheaper than going to an auto dealer and having your vehicle worked on for one hour.  Per flat rate hour, it's $160 to have a technician look at your vehicle.  Just want them to pull the codes? (takes all of 30 seconds), That'll be $80.  Minimum billable rate is a half hour.

And if you're unemployed and think you're "too good" for any work, you're a damned leech, and deserve no support.  If you can't find work, that's one thing, but if you turn down an offer of work, you're obviously not that needy, so you should get no support from society.  Back then, I would have shoveled shit if I had to.  I ended up going to work for a dealership as a lot jockey.  It's not glorious work by any means, but money is money. 




 Yes, it is.  Look at the former DDR, USSR, and today's DPRK.  All "working to communism".  Government control of everything. 




 Yes, by the fuel tax.  $0.18 federal tax, and $0.25 state tax.  Anybody who buys fuel pays for the roads.  They don't pull that money out of thin air, it's from fuel taxes.  The last I checked, fuel isn't free or subsidised.  Just because you pillocks in Europe pay asinine fuel taxes that make your fuel cost over $6/ga, doesn't mean that you have a better transportation network.  Outside of China, we have the largest developed road network in the world. 




 How's the IRA doing these days?  10 Downing Street been bombed lately? 




 On STATE and COUNTY roads, not the federal road network.  If it wasn't for JIT delivery, the interstate system could disappear right now, and I wouldn't notice a bit of difference.  

Petroleum is bought at the fuel station, (which is a privately owned business), shipped in large tanker trucks (also a private business), after being refined from oil, (also a private business), that was extracted from the ground by a large oil company, (also a private business).

Who's safety standards is my vehicle in compliance with?  Likely nobody's  It's a 1997 Chevrolet Blazer LT.  I know for a fact it wouldn't pass emissions.  But WA state doesn't have emissions checks outside of King and Spokane county.  Hell, I run a straight pipe.  I cut out the catalytic converter 5 years ago.

Education isn't "free".  Somebody is paying for it.  In the USA for K-12, it's the land owners that pay for the "free" education of primary and secondary school.  If you're poor enough, you can even make a little bit of money with the Pell grant system if you attend a community college.  

You won't be out a damned dime, all books would be covered, and you'll even make a little bit of money on top of that.  University is expensive.  About $25,000 a year for instate tuition, plus all the fees.  That's unreasonable, and the only way somebody could afford that without debt is to be independently wealthy, (or have connections).

And enrolling in school with a bunch of teens and 20 somethings is right in the list of my priorities the day after WWIII happens, and we bomb each other with dildos made out of silly putty.  College is completly useless at the community college level here.  I could get a degree in "customer service" for $12000, which would qualify me to .... work retail.  Yay.  Or you know, I can just go work retail, and skip all the debt and unneeded expenses.  Dropping 12k to get a 17.5k/year job.  Yeah, that's a good investment.  NOT.

Whoop de fucking doo, you're an engineer, and have more money than god.  I never will.  I've long given up on dreaming.  Dreaming happens when you sleep, and it isn't real.  People who still "dream" as adults have too much time on their hands, and need to get back to reality.  Life is what it is, and no amount of fantasizing of hoping or wishing will change it.

And for your information, I only went once back in 2010, and haven't went back yet.  (I have no need to).  In addition to giving them a whole truck load after that one time, I'll still occasionally buy a few extra things at IGA, and put them in the buggies that are set up for donations.  I've been there, and know how much it sucks, so if I can make somebody's day a little bit less sucky because I put in a flat of chilli, good.  It's not like it's expensive.  For $12, they get 15 cans. 




 Healthcare should have minimum standards as set by the CDC, (and they are), but beyond that, only emergent care should be subsidised.  For a regular checkup, pay the damned bill.  It's only $100.  I don't even remember the last time I even saw a doctor.  Yes, I make little enough that I do qualify for medicaid, but I don't even bother using it.  I really have no reason to see a doctor even once a year.

The church specifically isn't the best arbiter of where resources should go, but private charities are better than government largess.  Remember NOLA?  Who were the first trucks to deliver supplies there?  Was it Red Cross, or the national gaurd?  Nope.  It was Walmart.  They sent trucks in with batteries, potable water, propane tanks, tarps, etc.  All free.  Regarding articles:  Here you go:

http://www.forbes.com/sites/howardhusock/2014/04/10/lesson-for-april-15-why-government-cant-replace-charity/

I've never heard a thing called Jesus syndrome, and no, there is no virtue in suffering.  It should be a temporary thing, (if it exists), not a lifestyle.  Hard times come, and hard times go.  But if they come and stay, the problem isn't with the system, it's with you.  If a person thinks they are "above" a job while unemployed, they have some twisted sense of reality.  Do whatever it takes to keep the lights on.  Dreams are for children, and reality takes the driver's seat once you're an adult.

Yes, socialism, is government control of the economy, while the corporation is worker-owned.  Communism is where the government owns and controls everything. from how many bolts will be made in XXX factory, to how many potatoes will be harvested that year, and who will receive those potatoes.  How's your Trabant running these days?  Did you just get your ration of Rondo today? 




 I drove there, and called them up to see what the hours of the food bank were, (I saw a flier on a pole, so I took the number, and called to verify).  I don't hardly ever use federal highways.  I travel on state/county/city roads almost exclusively.  I was last on the interstate last January.  Hell, the nearest interstate is over 75 miles north of me.

I've only done it once, (can't shoot a wheat field to get bread).  But yes, I did repay them back many times over.  I got maybe $50 worth of food, but once I went back to work, I loaded up my truck and gave them back $258 worth of food.  Unlike the government, where whatever they give you was compulsory taken from somebody else. private charities are willingly donated to.  

I'm 32 years old, and I'm willing to bet you're an early 20 something who think that the government is the best solution to all of society's ills.  If that were the case, the USSR would have never failed, and the DDR would have built the wall to keep people out, (like we do with Mexico), instead of people in.

Yeah, you probably got in free because you either greased some palms, or had connections.  I wouldn't go to school even if it were free.  I would only do it if it were free, all books were paid for, and I got paid at least $19,000 a year to attend.  That's never going to happen, so I'll never attend.  It's not worth it.  I could personally give a shit less about unions.  Join one if you want.  However, mandatory union membership should not exist anywhere. 




 There's a difference between knowing that what I do online is tracable by my ISP, (and even then, I could use a VPN if I wanted), versus the passive media of TV.  I don't really want my TV, and some goons at TWC or DirectTV seeing my bum and pillock because I'm too lazy to put on pants. 




 I bet you couldn't even pass a US citizenship test.  If you can't pass the test, you don't deserve the right to vote.  If you have no understanding of how the government operates, you deserve no say in how the nation is run. 




 If you're perpetually reliant on the government to sustain your daily life, that is effectively no different than a minor child being reliant on his parents to live. 




 I paid them back easily once I got a job.  I got maybe $50 in foodsuffs from them, but once I was back to work, I loaded up my truck, and drove over there with $258 worth of food. I boggled thier mind when I told them I have a donation, and I'm going to need help to unload it.  They were pleasantly surprised when they asked what I wished to donate, and told them "Everything in the truck"

That's the difference between private charities and government entities.  What the government gives out to somebody, they have forcibly taken from somebody else.  When a private charity gives out goods, those goods were willingly given to that charity without threat of force.  

Government should not be in the charity business, it should be left to the private sector.  They are more efficient, and know where resources are needed.  If the government were better at resource utilization, the USSR would have never fell, and the DDR would have built the wall to keep the west out, and not the East in. 




 What's that going to do?  I know "non-realtime communications".  But hell, I can do that now with reddit, and email.  non-realtime broadcasting would make no sense.  It's sent over the air, and goes to the TV.  To "time shift", I have this magical thing invented in the 70's called a "VCR".  (well, my VCR is from 1994). 




 You're a bleeding heart liberal that runs off of emotion, and uses no logic in consideration of who you cast your ballot for.  Feelings are your sole guide in life, and if somebody questions why you voted for a person, you probably resort to "you're a wacist".. 




 "I didn't smoke that much pot!  I'm a frying pan!" 




 I've actually toyed with this idea. " God: The parent who isn't there for adults who's parents weren't there". I've noticed that the most fervent believers have had either abusive parents, or absent parents who didn't give a shit about their kids. They had no father to seek solace in, so they seek solace in the feelings that their idealistic invisible sky daddy initiates when thought about. It's sad.
 




 I primarily use my phone for mobile internet access.  I would be perfectly fine at $0.45/min of calling time, and $0.50/text.  I'm on the phone maybe 20 min a month, and send maybe 2 texts a month.  If I had unlimited internet, I honestly wouldn't care what voice/text service I had. 




 He didn't?  News to me!  Let's publish it!  HEY EVERYBODY!  SHERLOCK NEvER TOOK A DUMP! :D 




  Brave New World is an apt comparison.  All the information is there for anybody who wants it, but most people are fine being Betas and Gammas, and don't want to read.  Soma and LOLcats are their obsession.  Don't forget the Touchy-Feelies over on /r/politics!  You want to read and be informed?  You must be a fag or something.  Wow, reality has become a dystopian novel. :( 




 My bedroom TV is from 2002, and it doesn't even have a ATSC tuner in it.  I have it plugged direct into the wall, going through a QAM converter box to pick up digital channels.  I WON'T rent a cable box.  I don't want the CATV company seeing what I watch on my own private line.  Fuck targeted advertising.  If the day ever comes where I can't just plug in the line, and do a channel scan, I'm dumping CATV.  I've already started hooking up my "new" antenna.  I just have to figure out how to build a YAGI. 




 I'm not a Luddite.  I don't fear technology is going to put me out of work, (I'll do anything), nor am I technologically adverse.  I just don't like GPS, cameras, or mics.  (unless I'm taping something).  Yes, I still use my VCR.  My laptop is outdated enough, (Eee PC 1000HD), that Windows XP fully updated takes about 45 minutes to boot.  Windows 7 took 20 minutes.  

I completely got rid of Windows on it back in 2011, and replaced it with Debian running LXDE as the DE.  I have WINE 1.7 installed, so I CAN run Win32 programs if I really want to.  I haven't found a need to yet.  I'm thinking about swapping out my HDD for a SSD to make it boot faster, but it works fine for me.  I run Debian Sid.  I run Windows 10 on my desktop, but as far as portability and performance are concerned, Windows can go blow goats. 




 32 earth years as humans measure time. 




 My laptop is from 2009, and has no camera.  My phone is a SGSI, and has no front facing camera.  My truck is from 1997, and has the second year of OBDII diagnostics.  No GPS at all.  I don't even own a gaming platform The last one I even used was the SNES, back in 1994. 




 Can you now cram a half a loaf of bread into a pill? Are you a blue whale? 




 Round wheels are outdated. Replace them with tracks. 




 I refuse to buy one.  My cell phone is a SGS I.  No front camera.  When I did have my SGS III, I put black tape over the front lens.  I don't want a front facing camera.

 My laptop is from 2009, and I don't use webcams or mics.  I won't buy a laptop with a webcam or mic already installed. My desktop doesn't have a mic or a webcam, and I don't want one either.

Regarding my phone.  I'm on it so little that I'd be fine with a PDA with internet-only service, and calling rates at $0.45/min.  I don't even text that much.  Maybe 2 messages a month. 




 IN SOVIET RUSSIA... TV WATCHES YOU! (Hmm, smart TV's in the USA. Hits a little bit close to home eh?) The TeleScreen out of 1984 is here, and PEOPLE CLAMOR TO BUY ONE!! It was supposed to be a warning, not a "I want this" book! :( It's already bad enough that we have the "TV Walls" directly out of Fahrenheit 451, and the earbuds as described in that novel. Yes, I like my earbuds as much as the next dude, but when the TV watches YOU, technology has gone too far. I will never own a smart TV. I'd rather smash my TV with a hammer than buy that shit. 









 A train traveling through the DDR is carrying Stalin, Krushchev, and Breznev through the Urals. It breaks down.

Stalin lines up the crew of the train, the local villagers, and the passengers, and shoots every 5th person.

Krushchev lines up the survivors and gives them a rousing speech about how much better Soviet trains will run in 7 years.

Breznev sits back down, pulls the blind shut, bounces up and down in his seat, and pretends the train is still running.

The DDR politburo votes themselves out of office because the train won't run.

:D 




 [Walmart](http://www.walmart.com/ip/41208764?reviews_limit=9 ) for 3% solution.  Want 90%?  Qualifies as rocket fuel, and you need clearance from DHS to import it, but [here you go](http://www.peroxidepropulsion.com/hydrogen-peroxide.php).  I think it's around $5/lb.


 **EDIT:** You probably need clearance from BATFE and the FBI too.  And you thought gasoline was expensive?   Pure H2O2 is around $40/ga. 




 Liberals, (and people who vote on nothing but emotion), are the complete morons. Not me.  "feelings" should have no say in political decisions. 




 So you're saying the blowhard His Highness Jessie Jackson **does** represent all black people? 




 The LD50 is 2g/KG.  a 4.5 OZ chug would kill 50% of people weighing 150LBS.

 Post offices:  Where you get mail.

Post Roads:  Roads used to transport the mail.  See *Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States* (1833).

 Nobody represents anybody except for themselves.  Just like that windbag Jessie Jackson doesn't represent black people. 




 Yes, a couple of times I've had to go to the church food bank just to keep food on the table, (I had meat from the deer, but nothing else).  I'll sit through a sermon to get bread and chilli, and 1 can of soda, and pinto beans.  It's humiliating, but if it keeps my wife and daughter fed, I'll do it.  It sucks, but you gotta do what you gotta do to keep food on the table.

Yes, I would much rather be independent, and get off of assistance as fast as possible, but being unemployed for 7 months not knowing how to keep the lights on, or where your next meal is coming from kind of sucks.  Actually, it sucks a lot.  I didn't have to worry about losing my place, because I paid a year ahead.  I got CATV because I have cable tools.  I wasn't ballsy enough to fuck with the electric box.  That shit can, (and will), kill you, (if you don't burn alive first).

Temporary stop-gap measures are one thing, (that's why safety nets exist, to keep you from falling to your metaphorical death), but it's a net, not a damned hammock.  I gave up my daughter for adoption later, because I reasoned "if I can't even feed myself without resorting to poaching and begging churches, how the hell am I going to feed a kid?  I can't even afford diapers for her, and she's using my old shirts."  I went on a 15 mile walk that day, and almost didn't come back home.  I was thinking one thing that day.  "Head south".  Where I was going?  I have no clue beyond "south". I got a ride back to town with the county sheriff.  My wife called me in, and the sheriff convinced me to get in his rig so he could take me back home. 




 I got no problems with the income tax, I fully expect to support the DOD with my dollars, (hey, I live here too, and if the Russians invade, the USMC and Navy are the first line of defence).  But to support old fuckers who live off of the dole on SSI who contribute nothing to the economy, (and never will again).  Fuck that shit.  Also "sin tax" is full of shit too.
 




 Where you came to the fight defending liberals.  Since you defend them, you are one. 




 Well, you did self ID as a liberal.  That makes you a Communist, Socialist, Green, or Democrat.  And since all of these parties have no chance in hell, I'm willing to bet you vote Democratic. 




 The US Constitution actually explicitly authorises "Post offices and Post Roads".  (Article I, section 8).  It's not an "either-or" proposition.  It's "within the confines of the constitution" proposition.  Also, the Federal government only pays for the US road network, and Interstate system.  County roads are paid by the county, city roads by the city, and state routes by the state.  The Federal government really has very little say in the road infrastructure. 




 Depends on what taxes. 




 Actually, I would expect people raised by parents who can't keep to a simple buget to be more advantaged.  They saw what not living within your income will do.  (power shut off, loss of cable TV, having to sell drugs just to make ends meet, eviction, etc).  That is a good lesson on what **NOT** to do.  

Yes, there is a difference between taking SNAP in a temporary situation, and making a lifesyle out of it.  If you need it temporarily because you honestly can't afford to feed your family, or if you "poach" a deer for nothing but the meat, (I didn't see anything).  Shit happens, and a temporary helping hand (or a blind eye), can work wonders.  But if you make a lifestyle choice out of being a welfare queen, then you should be thrown out on the streets, and have all your benefits cut for life.

I've been within 12 hours of having my utilities cut, and I went hat in hand to CAC for emergency electricity assistance.  I've got it once.  I was literally looking at having my power cut in the middle of January, and Project Share through Avista kept my lights on.  That was the most embarrassing day of my life.  I shot a whitetail deer that year to keep my family fed, and I didn't have a license.  I did it out of need, not want.  (it was out of season anyways, so I couldn't have gotten a licence even if I wanted to).  But then again, if I could afford the hunting license, I wouldn't be illegally harvesting game, would I?

Yes, sometimes times can get tough, and people do need a helping hand, but if you make it a lifestyle, you're a fucking mooch, and should be thrown out on your ass.  BTW, I don't have my parents to rely on.  My dad died in 2010.  My mom is too busy traveling the country to CA and AZ outrunning the cold.  I have my step-mom.  I've only called her once, and that was when I stupidly parked in a neighbor's parking spot and got a $500 tow bill for one day.  I owe her that money back, and I fully intend to repay her, (whenever I can scare up the $380 that I have remaining).

 Then you have SSI, and SSDI in case of an intractable severe mental of physical illness.  Those are special cases.  I was thinking more along of the welfare queens who crank out children so they can get TANF and food stamps, and section 8 housing, and Medicaid.  They don't work because they don't want to, not because they physically cannot.  If you had shitty parents, it's time to grow up and learn to make your own way in the world.  

I grew up upper-middle income, and at 32 years old, I make less than $20,000 a year.  Hell, the most I ever made was $10/hr in 2008.  Adjusted for inflation, that's $11.12/hr in today's dollars.  I honestly don't think I'll ever earn $80,000 a year, or even $24000 a year, (adjusted for inflation).  Still, there is value in independence, and not having your ass pampered by the "all knowing and all caring government". 




 I know about the Demon-craptastic party, and that's enough for me.
 




 No more than you liberals wanting Uncle Sam to be your daddy. while remaining a perpetual dependent child. 




 The desire to be free to do as I like, so long as I don't harm anybody else.  Also, I view government dependence as a negative thing.  You're an adult, rely on yourself; not the government. 




 Two men walk into a bar, and the bartender asks "What'll you have?"

The first man says "I'll have some H2O!"

The bartender pours the man a glass, and the first man gets refreshed.

The second man says "I'll have some H2O too!"

The bartender pours the man a glass, and the second man dies.

 Turn it down you say

Well, all I got to say to you is time and time again I say

"No, no, no, no, no, no, no" 




 It may be fake, (it is), but it's still funny. :)  (IIRC, the joke goes back to the 1920's.) 









 AKA:  Cougar. 




 Looks like a Puma to me. 




 Yes, most of the time.  They mostly want to be left alone, and are human adverse.  They only wander into human territory if they are extremely hungry, and intend to get meat wherever they can.  On the ranch, they'll attack your livestock.  But if you shoot at it, (well, in front of it), it'll run.  Pumas are also known as a mountain lion, or a cougar. 
























 Probably because they were told to by their parents, or the insurance company told them that they can get a discount if they do. 




 I haven't driven distracted since I was 19, and drove my car into a 12 foot deep ditch because I was trying to read my mail while driving down the road.  My car was undamaged, but a 2 ton truck Avista had to pull me out.  Good thing I knew Gravy or that would have been a hell of a tow bill.  I don't text and drive, or use my phone and drive.  The most I'll "read" while driving down the road is printed off instructions on how to get where I'm going.  And I do that at red lights.  (what's going to happen there?  They'll honk at me to tell me the light's green now?) 

















































 I grew up, and I don't want a speeding ticket, excessive display of horsepower, racing, and reckless driving charges.  Also, speed kills.  Want to race?  Go to the track. 




 Don't forget Fahrenheit 451. 




 One Second After really highlighted how dependent we are on electrical services for modern society, and just how fragile it is.

A History of God showed how all religion is a sham, and how I've been lied to all of my life. about it. 














 For the same reason I don't believe in underpants gnomes, god, or leprechauns. 



















 Pullman is a pretty safe city.  Break-ins and HIR's are very rare here.  I accidently left my keys in the ignition, and all 4 windows down in my truck yesterday at Sunnyside park, and my truck was still there exactly how I left it when I returned 5 hours later. 




 A religiidiot would say something on the order o*f "They haven't reached the age of accountability yet, so they get a free pass"*, or something like *"But it's a metaphor, as we're all God's children!"* 




 So an archaic of "to".  That's almost as bad; Jesus wants to watch kids jack off. 




 Jesus was a paedophile into bukakke, and he promised that kids who ejaculate upon him eternal life in the kingdom of god.

" But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven."

--Matthew 19:14 (KJV) 



















 Well, I wasn't really allowwed to as a youth, so when I became an adult, I just got used to being alone.  I only really go 3 places.  the store, work, and home.  If I'm not at one place, I'm likely at home.  Also 32 years old is too old to start to get into the social scene, (especially when I really have no interest in meatspace interaction)

Another thing, I've never been searched for drugs.  Besides MJ is legal here in WA. 




 how the hell can you tell that by internet?  Yeah, it's plainly obvious when I go to the park and can do a duck call well enough to get ducks over to my area without even a duck call just using my mouth, or when I bark back at dogs, and get into a barking competition with them, and I greet random cats on the street by trilling at them and slowly blinking at them, but how the hell can you tell that by text?

And I doubt 20% of any group is corrupt.  Unless you're in Mexico, that is.  Or basically ALL of the national media in the USA, (and most local sources). 














 Funny gross shit like Jackass 1 and 2, not disgusting for the sake of being disgusting. a dude taking a shit in a toilet store is gross and funny.  Drinking a whole bottle of Syrup of ipecac and puking to the screen is just disgusting. 




 LOL @ that.  They already are. :D They are a NFA Destructive Device. :)  But probably.  The media doesn't know shit from shinola about weaponry and the laws governing it.  Hell, they call a 10/22 with an extended magazine an "assault weapon with a banana clip". 




 No shit, but how would the news media react?  How would the american population react if somebody pulled up to them, and fired light artillery at the WBC and drove off? 




 I didn't they said "less than $10".  Purchased?  lighters.  I can't live wthout fire.  I always have one on me (or 4). 




 Jackass 3D.  It was so bad, that even though I pirated it, it wasn't worth my time.  I lasted 45 minutes, turned it off, and deleted it from my HDD.  I'm never watching it again.  It wasn't funny, it was just disgusting. 




 Air.  Price $0  Value:  Priceless. 




 Because "being who I am" really has succeeded so far in getting me dates, right?  It's not like I'm going to make strange sex jokes in public places, say "hey watch this", and deep throat a foot long hotdog just to freak people out, and randomly blurb out "Kitty hat, kitty hat, Kitty hat hat!" in public.  The men in the white coats would come, and haul me off to the looney bin. 




 Changing out an alternator in the dark sucks along with new wires because they fried, and a new battery because you drained it dead, and are now driving home with parking lights for 30 miles SUCKS ASS! 




 If that was considered a felony, I would get the chair.  Yes, I'm guilty of that. 




 Done. :)  Thanks for the unofficial warning. :) 




 With what?  My "environmental hazard" known as my truck.  I already know I need a new radiator, and coolant hoses, and a new front bumper, and a new WWF resivoir.  Yes, I drive a rolling superfund site.  (I got into a collisoin in 2011, and I've been driving it). 




 ..... Give them a gay parade...... :) 




 OK, what if the lady offered a BJ or whatever, and the dude said, "What are you, some kind of pervert?  I just want a date with a movie and dinner, pretend to enjoy my company is all I ask, not a blowjob or a handjob.  Does this look like the plot of FMJ?!  $150/hr lady.  Take it or leave it!"

**edit:**  For that much money, I would pretend to be gay, but the most "sexual contact" that would ever ever happen is holding hands, and even then I'm wearing sun glasses so I can't easily be IDed as a "queer"  (word spreads fast around town, and I don't want to be known as a "queer".  Oh god, dudes hitting on me, no thanks shudders.  There's a VERY significant difference between tolerance, (I tolerate whining kids on the aeroplane); acceptance, ( I accept the fact that global climate change may be influenced by mankind), and celebration, I celebrate the 4th of july with explosives that are legal only only 3 days out of the year).

I accept homosexuals, (just like you and me), but am I going to ever applaud butt-fucking as the superbowl sunday show [if it ever happened], NO!  I don't care if it was a dude-dude, chick-dude, or chick-chick.  I'd rather watch a literal monkey fucking a football than that, (and I would still change the channel) 




 OK, I'm starting to think that these escort services like I treat "designer drugs".  Yeah, they're legal, but can fuck your life up?  I won't touch "designer drugs" with a 12 foot pole, (and I have one), because I had to sit through my neighbor pounding on my door at 0200 because he thought he was going to die.  That was enough to scare me off of that idea.  Fuck "designer drugs".  He refused the ambulance several times even though he was scared shitless.  I went to sleep before he did, but when I woke up the next "day", (all of 1.5 hrs later)  I rolled him over with my foot and said "hey, still alive?"  He grumbled and asked "where am I?"  I told him the address and said "you're alive.  Go home.  Whatever you did, don't do it again"  

You can stay here until 1200, then I expect you to make the journey back home of all of 20 feet"  He said "20 feet?"  can you help me to my couch?  I said "not a problem.  Where's your keys?"  He said  "I have keys?"  I said, "Umm let me check your house".  it was unlocked, so I just opened up the door as wide as it would go, and went and got him.  I lied and told him, "you left them in the lock, your house is open, I'll take you home."  He agreed, so I plopped him on his couch, locked the door behind me, and went to work. Dumbass high guy from Lithuania.  I should have called an ambulance.

Still, he refused medical treatment, so from my understanding there's nothing I can do.  I must have asked him 15 or 16 times if he wanted to go to the hospital.  He kept on refusing treatment, so from what I remembered from first aid training, I couldn't do anything until he went unconscious, (but I did first because of being tired).

**TL;DR;**  Fuck designer drugs.  I had one scare with that shit, that's enough for me.. 




 "no mommy, I'll be good girl and lay on the bed with daddy!" 









 Rich dudes that are lonely, and people on craigslist? 



















 So, I guess it takes a ELI:Sociologist, not ELI5?  Can't say for the cat, but for the dog, I think you got it. 




 OK, what led person A to be like a dog with his former HS bully, and even a look could send person A cowering and curling up in the corner of the bus seat because she had a beef that wasn't with him because she might see him? And if she happened to sit next to him, he was shaking uncontrollably and try to make himself as small as possible, (fuc getting hit, she hits hard), (almost deathly afraid of a chick none the less), but other cats she tried that with fought back, even though it was futile? 




 Only after I get it from a choice of prime cuts at the local cannibal shop. :D 




 OK, among the beaten, why are some people like a dog being punished, (lowered head and make it obvious that they're sorry, trying not go get hit again), but others are like a scared cat, (they know they can't win, but they call names and such, and threaten to fight even though the older and bigger cat can obviously win)?  Is it just because they go with they know what works and will give them the least harm?   




 There is danger in either circumstance.  It's either "Hit me as much as you want, just please don't kill me" or "fine, kill me.  Just end it".

**DO NOT SHOW KIDS THESE MOVIES!!** 














 I don't mean the fireworks. 




 Sweet!  If I ever be rich, I'm hiring one.   Hey, maybe if I hire the same chick enough, she might begin to like me, and will date without pay?  THat would be awesome.  Like jumping off of Granite point, or going fishing, or camping for a night (in separate tents), or shooting, or eating lunch down by the river.  Hell if I know. 




 "Can you smile like a donut?"

"Yes"

"Show me"

guy does it

"You're hired!" 




 god damn it.  I aint rich, so I guess I'll piss that idea off. 




 Where does one find them? 




 I've tried.  It didn't work.  Now I just go to the bar once or twice a year because I miss people to argue football with, not for chicks.  I gave that up in 2004, (the year I turned 21).  I'm too old to hit on chicks at a bar.  City-data.com backs me up.  Look up Pullman WA. 




 I honestly don't know how.  I've tried bars, I've tried work, I've tried old FB friends that I used to know 20 years ago.  Got shot down at every one of them.  I know of "why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free", but I can't seem to find any cattle around here, and this steer, (i've had a vasectomy, so keeping with the analogy), still misses the company of a cow.  (and I don't mean fat chicks either). 




 My dad cut me off in 1999 because I was using too much of his internet time and hogging the phone line, so I ran my own line, and blueboxed an open frequency, and slam dialed every ISP in the Union to get a connection, and started dialing.  I eventually got through to an ISP in Topeka, KS, and I was caught in 2 hours because I only wanted free internet access without tying up my dads phone line.  (I stopped blue boxing, but I kept the phone line).   Everything about what I did was completely illegal, but I was  16 at the time, (I think that's the only reason they let it go, and I convinced them that I had no clue what was going on.)  My dad knew exactly what was going on.  He opened up the camper and said "XXXXXX, you need to take this call NOW.  It's the FBI!"  I knew exactly why I was getting the call.  Not doing that again.  (OK, I was cracking, not hacking).  But I didn't do it for commercial purposes, just "I want free internet".  (defrauding a public utility).  Yes, I kept the phone line, and now my home ranch has 2 lines. :) ) 




 Sweet. :)  Now to get rich enough to actually do it.  Doing it the old fashioned way doesn't seem to work.  ( I mean actually getting them interested in you, not handjobs).  I tried to get somebody on a date from my FB contacts that I haven't seen for over 20 years, and I think I got shot down).  She's a good internet friend, and lives less than 2 miles away from me, but I just want to go have a picnic in the park, (and I don't mean oral sex), not bang her, and still I get shot down). 




 I doubt it, other than my DUI, the most "criminal" charges, I've ever had is a sheriff rolled up on me laying on the ground looking up at the moon.  He just told me to go home, and I can't lay down in public in parking lots, the street, or sidewalks..  (and he thought I was odd because I was looking at the moon in binoculars.  I think he thought I was a peeping tom or something.) 




 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9TShlMkQnc

That's country. 




 I've never picked up a whore, and I don't intend to, the most I've thrown "caution to the wind", is seeing cleavage and a camel toe, and while driving almost lose control because I was "busy gawking at the chick in lingerie on the street".  it made me look twice.    Yes, I got stopped because they wondered why I was swerving.  They asked why I wasn't looking at the road, and I said "because an almost naked lady".  They just told me "In the future, watch where you're actually going, and don't oogle women.  You're free to go." 




 What's so hard to understand?  He broke down, and was trying to flag somebody down to take him to a petrol station, and I happened to walk out my door at the time, and saw he neded help, so I approached, and it turns out he ran out of gas.  I towed him back to work with my Blazer.  We've been hanging out at each other's houses and watching TV together, and we drink each other's beer. :)  He wants to take me fishing this summer, (if I tow, he doesn't have a hitch), and he's willing to pay for the gas to get to the river.  I got a job contact through him too. :) 




 Yeah, I guess what I'm asking is are escorts legal, (so long as no sex acts are even considered, they just want a "girlfriend" for the night, and nothing more.)  Somebody to pretend they like the dude, and go see a movie and dinner afterwards, then drop them off back at home, (or wherever). 




 Ah, that explains it, (I think), so if some dude just wanted a "date" without sexual contact, and was willing to pay for the time, they would tell the "john" to get lost? 




 Oh, I think Argentina is in the ATL TZ. :)  Would the undercover go for it, or shoot him down, (metaphorically)?
Im in PST, (but we still use DST).  So, you're 4 hours ahead of me. :) 




 Good point, in GMT, it's 0258.  You must be in Sydney or Brisbane. 




 Umm, I just want somebody else with the dude that I made friends with because I towed him back to work in the Avista truck because he broke down, (out of gas), and I've been over to his house several times, and he's came here several times.  I'm obviously not gay, I just want somebody to hang out with at home.  I sort of am since my wife and SIL left me.  I like having a clean house though. :) 




 Would a regular whore do it?  (after all, they just want money; and they don't care if the dude paid them $150/hr to watch TV, or give them a BJ).  (No, I'm not going to pick up a whore to watch TV with me, [or do anything else, I kind of like not being HIV positive); I have a dude friend I can do that with). 




 Myself?  What type of question is this? 




 Yes, it did. 




 Uhh, the last time I tried that, I got a call from some local ISP and ATT because I was getting free internet access out of Tepoka, Kansas.  They told me to check my phone lines.  I'm not doing that again. O.o  That was embarrassing to get called in from the camper to the house from my dad. O.o  They almost made it a federal investigation.  I've stopped doing that. 




 No. 




 Don't want to.  Social interaction IRL is draining. 




 Maybe 1 or 2 friends, (and I made one the other day), but beyond that, nope.  I don't like going out.  "hanging out" without purpose is a waste of time. 




 How so?  Yes, you can trip out to classical music, (on salvia), but not on bluegrass.   Classic rock is the best, IMHO, but I have nothing against most genres of music, (except pop teeny bopper shit). 




 Around here, my best chances for a decent paying job are working the family ranch, and working harvest when it comes up.  Short of that, it's PRH, WSU, or SEL.  Other than that, everybody pays minimum wage.

(yay pullman...) 




 Would the undercover go for it, or shoot him down, (metaphorically)?  $150/hr of pay to pretend to enjoy an evening isn't a crime. (at least as far as I know).
 




 Would the undercover go for it, or shoot him down, (metaphorically)?

**EDIT:**  Shit, I meant an evening, not one hour.  That wouldn't even be enough time for dinner. 




 Breakfast at 1914hrs?  Do you work a night shift? 




 I've only been to one party in my life, and I didn't have fun. 




 My 3 bdrm 2 bath house with 2 designated parking spots is a basement now?  What's the main level?  That $650000 house across town? 




 I have no interest in gaming, and there's no LUG around here for adults. 




 Temporarily, nope.  I do work back home on the family ranch for money, and it's the best money I've eber made at $11.77/hr.  I wish I could get hired full time, I'd make about 1975/mo, and I would be living with no problems. 




 Pretty much! :D 




 I agree with the fans, most are a bunch of rhinestone cowboys, (or all hat and not cattle), but the music itself is decent.  And it's not like country has a monopoly on monotonous themes.  

Ever heard a rap song?  It's about how much life in the ghetto sucks, (to get down to it), pimps, drugs, "hoes", or shooting cops, or other black people, and the N-word is used a lot, or shooting up who knows what.  

Rock is "drugs, sex, and rock and roll"

Classic Music is mostly about God and Nature, and war stories.

Country is about pickup trucks, God, TV, 9/11, America Is Best, Hard Working men, Urbanization, etc.

Death metal is about being pissed off.

Classic rock (like pink floyd's "Dark Side of the Moon, or "The Wall"), is mostly a life story, but also drugs, sex, and rock and roll.

Blues is how much life sucks, regardless of where you are from

 I don't think they do think it out, just pulling something out of my ass, but if I wanted to kill EMS workers, I'd report a false fire, (or start one in a skip), report it, and have trip wires on pipe bombs, and shoot mortars (the fireworks ones) at them.  That would actually cause a fire, and severely maim (or kill) whoever tripped the wire.

No, I have no intention of doing that.  I don't have a beef with anybody.  So burning your own house down and sitting there with an AK makes no sense at all. 




 That's fucked up.  O.o  They don't think this shit out, do they? 




 That's fucked up.  People wire their house to blow up?  What the hell?  And what the fuck is wrong with the dude that stayed in his house after it got torched.  Fire = get the hell out.  I don't care whether it's the cops, or the neighbor pounding on my door in that circumstance.  I'll go investigate, then get the fuck out.  I was in a house fire in 2001, and ran outside with no pants on to see how bad it was.  Wasn't too bad, so I went back inside and put pants on.  By the time I got out again (maybe 30 seconds), the entire upstairs was engulfed. 




 OK, that explains doors that are solid, but why for doors that have a viewing window?  Couldn't the person just look out and fire in that direction? (like the house that got the door knocked on)? 




 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_citizen_movement#Theories

Legislated to give the freed black slaves after the Civil War rights comparable to the unalienable constitutional rights of white state citizens. The benefits of U.S. citizenship are received by consent in exchange for freedom. State citizens consequently take steps to revoke and rescind their U.S. citizenship and reassert their de jure common-law state Feucitizen status. This involves removing one's self from federal jurisdiction and relinquishing any evidence of consent to U.S. citizenship, such as a Social Security number, driver's license, car registration, use of ZIP codes, marriage license, voter registration, and birth certificate. Also included is refusal to pay state and federal income taxes because citizens not under U.S. jurisdiction are not required to pay them. Only residents (resident aliens) of the states, not its citizens, are income-taxable, state citizens argue. And as a state citizen land owner, one can bring forward the original land patent and file it with the county for absolute or allodial property rights. Such allodial ownership is held "without recognizing any superior to whom any duty is due on account thereof" (Black's Law Dictionary). Superiors include those who levy property taxes or who hold mortgages or liens against the property.[14]

Yep, it sounds like they think they are their own nation state.  That's fucked up man. 




 Wouldn't the door actually be better?  After all, I can punch through the wall, (if it's sheetrock), but there's no way in hell I could punch through a metal door. 




 WTF is a sovereign citizen?  People think they are their own nation-states? 




 I was having a beer in my front lawn looking around to "see what I can see", and I saw an officer go up to a neighbor's house, and stand to the side of the door and knock, and then wait.  Why? 




 Most shootings occur with gang-on-gang violence, and they're not supposed to have them in the first place.  It's already illegal to either supply felons with weapons, be a felon in a possession of a weapon, or do straw man purchases, or modify firearms to be automatic, or to alter the serial number, or import without a VERY thorough investigation, or a whole lot of other shit. (See 18 USC Section 922 for further details.  Yes, subsection (r), is pumb fucking stupid, but the law is the law.) 




 No, people shouldn't be forced to carry a weapon if they don't want to, (or don't know how to use it, then they shouldn't).  I'm just saying that "GUN FREE" = "Victim disarmament".  Gun control only disarms the people who are willing to stay within the law, not the criminal element.  When is the last time you heard of somebody holding a gun to somebody's head with the express intent of killing them, only to say "wait, murder is illegal, I better not do it or I'll go to prison"?  Never.

But if people had a chance to shoot back, these mass murders wouldn't happen.  I agree with you completely on the lack of professional journalism in the USA.  That's why I watch BBC, and listen to France24.  The only time I even am exposed to American "Journalism" is in my truck, and I keep it tuned to KQQQ and KQZB. 




 Yes, and he got a $6.1M "reward" in civil court for it.  IMHO, Janet Reno should be locked up in ADX Florence for the crimes she allowed to perpetuate under her leadership.  Also, The government has this thing called "sovereign immunity".  You can't criminally prosecute the government, {or even sue them}, (except under extreme situations). 




 I think it's Putin.  He wants to reestablish the USSR, and the dude is on a power trip wanting to destroy the world. 




 Who said anything about race?  If I hire somebody to go kill person XXX, that's organized crime, but if I just go shoot up a house because I suspect person XXX might be there, (or I want to intimidate his family, [or his neighbors, etc]), then I would be a thug. 




 Ruby Ridge.  They shot his pregnant wife, and even killed his dog. 




 Kazakhstan?  




 You're right and wrong.  I have no clue about military history with bands, (why I'm asking), but do want to learn why using such tactics that could get your ass blown to hell and back were employed at all, (why I'm asking). 




 Every state in the union "right to carry", and "shall-issue".  Just think, what if in that church, What if one person was armed and could shoot back?

For the sake of argument, let's say he's not combat trained, and hits 2 or 3 people firing blindly in the dark before stopping the intruder?

How many people would have been saved? 23. (discounting the assailant). 




 Given the choice of being governed by the baboons in WDC, or the local mafia, I choose the mafia.  Protection money is cheaper than taxes.  If the government burns your house down because you won't pay, it's "tax collection".  If the mafia does, it's arson.  The government is lauded, the mafia is despised. 




 The government is legal. 




 I guess they didn't get much mail then.  I wouldn't bother either.  I do like Maxim magazine while on the john though, so I'd go in once a month at least. 




 You mean like the government?

What's the difference between the mafia and the government?

The government is legal.

 holy shit!  Did they have an entire mail bag waiting for them? O.o 




 OK, hopefully we never get nuked so I don't have to use it.  That would really suck. 




 That explains how it works!  Thanks!  But how do they know if they got mail or not?  Do they have to ride into town once a week or something? 




 Nah, thugs shoot up anybody they can.  The mafia only targets men that have a beef with them.  They're a racketeering organization, and a criminal influence, not a thug. 




 The only reason I know about it is from NWSS.  If your nation gets nuked, the mail won't operate like it has since the mid 1800's.  You have to collect your mail at the post office, and stand in a queue to get it.  But how do you know if you even got mail that day, and you didn't walk to the post office for no reason? (or hitch up your horse and ride into town for no reason)?

 The mafia aren't thugs, they're organized crime, and prosecutable under RICO statutes.  I wouln't classify the Hells Angels as anything, because if you don't fuck with them, they won't fuck with you.  The most you'll see of them is them driving motorbikes on the way to wherever the hell they're going, and lie to your wife "I guess there's a harley convention in town, and keep on driving, (knowing exactly why there are so many motorbikes on the road).

 Thinking about that mule eating on a literal pile of shit, and my dad's reaction to seeing it driving down the road. He almost vomited in the truck, and I had to steer because he was busy puking out the window. :D 









 Actually, yes. I'm playing off of Jesus/Hey-Zeus. :)

Landholder says: "Do you have a warrant?" 




 OK, I know it's hollywood, but why in the movies, is there a drum roll right before firing off the cannon?  I could see that working **ONCE** as a signal, but then the enemy will figure out what it means, and just shoot at the drummers.  (no music, no commands). 




 No, "Limies" refer to the UK soldiers.  And yes, limes are an excellent solution to Scurvy, (high in acidity, so don't need to keep chilled, and they don't rot for a long time if kept in the bellows of the ship where it's reasonably cool enough like a cellar). 




 Because "find title" didn't work, and it's still basically the same title.

 Fuck shooting my 590 indoors, I've already experienced that when I was 8 when my dad had an ND.  I thought he offed himself and ran to his bedroom crying because I thought he killed himself with a 7MM magnum).

But why music instead of the sergeant with a bullhorn? 




 No shit it didn't exist, but why a band instead of a bullhorn with the sergeant?  Bullhorns have existed since forever.  It's called a large funnel with the end chopped off.  Or cup your hands around your mouth and yell.

**EDIT:**  FFS, I could use a traffic cone as a bullhorn if I really wanted to. 




 I think I prefer radios. and APCs, and air support.  Fuck the band.

**EDIT** Wait, is that why watching old movies about the civil war or the war of independence, the music changes when actively engaged in combat? 




 We still do here in Pullman.  We play the Marine corps, the air force, and the army hymns.  This is basically our play list in Pullman:

I'm just glad that that song "put a boot in your ass" finally died.  It's broadcast live on KHTR. :)

 




 Yes, they do make noise no matter how much they are trying to be quiet.  So I guess thank god for automobiles, hovercraft, the SEALS, and air support with helo lift? 




 Before the 1700's?  America was too busy being a British colony.

 I just tried.  I got laughed at on the phone.  She didn't know what I was asking, so I told her about top gear and how they race on tarmac, and there's no track around here, so how much would it cost to rent the tarmac for an afternoon?  They won't let me do that.  That was sort of embarrassing getting laughed at by the lady at the aeroport. O.o.   




 Damn it.  How hard would it to be to rent the airport runway for an afternoon?

 I was on acid, but my end table turning into this strange machine that had gears and pulleys, and wheels and belts, and ramps and belts, and there were a bunch of 2" tall people running around making this machine work.  I couldn't figure out what the hell they were making, or what the machine was supposed to do, but it was the coolest thing I ever saw.  LSD is a hell of a drug, and you can see some amazing shit that is mind boggling.

**EDIT:**  I couldn't figure out what the hell they were doing, but I didn't try to engage and just watched it trying to figure out what the hell they were doing.  Whatever those mini-people were doing, they looked busy, so I didn't want to disturb them.  I had this thought of "Woah, what if this is how power really works?" and was looking for wires, but couldn't find any.  Since I couldn't figure out what the hell they were doing, I just watched. 20m later *poof* gone.  Then I decided to walk outside, and I "felt the gas station".  That was the coolest thing I ever felt. :) 




 *cough* pullman wa *cough*

Nope, not INS. 




 Is that even available to free members?  From what I hear, the A-List thing isn't really worth it. 




 Travel to a city

Therein lies the problem.  I just filled up, and my truck gets 11.9 MPG. 




 I was up at Stateline about 10 years ago, and they let you race if you have a seatbelt, (or not if your rig was made before 63 or so), and have a $10 bill for admittance for an hour.  I just called the LC airport to see if they'll let me use a runway for an afternoon. :)  That's really the only option I have if I want to keep it off the streets.  I got that idea from Top Gear.  They race on aeroport tarmac, so maybe I can too?  IDFK?  Worth a shot though.

I saw a jetcar explode, and a stock car race.  Watching a high speed collision live is a hell of a lot different than on TV.  I saw that car flip 5 times and land on it's wheels.  The crowd was silent as a grave.  I wanted to see cars go fast, not have a wreck and get towed out after the EMT's and the fire truck came out and made sure the dude was alive.  O.o  I didn't have enough balls to get on the track after seeing that.

**EDIT:**  And now you know why I get into street drags on occasion, but after seeing a couple of videos on this forum, I don't want to do that anymore because even if I was Dale Earnhardt, shit happens.  I remember that race too.  I want to keep it off of the street. 




 Life.  It doesn't matter if you're a billionaire without any heirs when you die. 




 Marry an asian chick, and have fun for like ever.  I could introduce her to t-bone steaks, mashed potatos, and corn on the cob, and greenbeans, and keystone ice.  She could introduce me to whatever they eat over there, and we'd have fun, and go hiking at the butte, and go fishing, and generally have fun. 




 I'm not one anymore, but in my youth I did a lot of shit.

* Keep your car locked, most thefts are opprotunistic crimes.

* Take your keys with you, and roll up your windows.  I never took a rig without easy access to it.  (1998 camaros haul ass BTW)

* Make sure you have a secondary ignition interlock, even if they have a screwdriver and a a hammer, it's not going to do much good if they can't find the secondary ignition switch.

* Surprisingly enough, a push button and a ignition toggle lever.  Most thieves (well kids), want to have a good time, and not jack your rig.  They won't be able to figure it out, and will leave you alone even if they do gain access.

* keep your rig clean on the interior.  Messy car = easy target.  Nobody's really going to notice if I'm driving a broken down ford that looks like a rolling trash can with a broken ignition switch. 




 I'm in pullman WA, and feeling "the need for speed again", but I'm too old to get into a street drag, (and I don't really want to spin out of control and kill somebody).  Anybody know of any closed roads around, or a track? 




 Do you know if there is a track around here?  I'm feeling "the need for speed", but I'm too old to get into a street drag.

 Either VGH or R-Tech systems.  Both places know what the hell they are doing.  They have parts.  I went to R-tech back in 2005 because I didn't have a spare MB and processor, so I took it to them.  6 hour turn around time.  I was impressed, so I let them fix it.  Oh, if you tell them not to touch a HDD, they'll physically disconnect it so you don't have to worry about being spotted for being a movie pirate with over 500G of film. :) 




 I ... um ... what? O.o  I'm confused. 




 We have exactly 1 sit down resturant with asian food in town, and it sucks pretty bad.  I mean besides Tokyo Seoul.  I'm not even sure what they're trying to pass themselves off as. 




 Because I want to try some asian food, and I think the local one resturant is shit, so I'm hoping that I could introduce them to Tbones and mashed potatoes, and corn on the cob, and green beans, and they can introduce me to hot shit that is good from wherever they're from.  When I say "recent", i mean within the last 10 years.  Not so far away that they don't remember how to cook good shit, but not so recent that no english. 




 I guess I should has specified asians that are recent immigrants and live within 5 miles of my house.  White chicks are ok too, but I like asians better. 




 well, I already have that nailed down.  Do they like a specific look in mind, or is it a crap shoot?

 No kid should ever have to utter the words that "daddy is too busy, he flew off to Detroit, and I'm living at home alone now for the next 3 weeks" when asked by the teacher  at 8 "Why didn't your dad come to the parent-teacher meeting?  Is something going on?"  I got a lot of free food those 3 weeks, and had a lot of chores to do but "I kept the hosue running", so I did a good job. 














 Yep.  Had the CSA not fired on Sumpter, it's likely that the USA would have just left and pulled the troops out.  It was a failed project from the start, but so was the USA prior to French intervention.  Had the British and French intervened on behalf of the CSA, history would have likely played out very differently, (and they almost did). 




 Yes they were.  They were also the first to institute the draft, and print "greenbacks" backed up by nothing, and to institute an income tax to fund the war effort, and rationing of goods to the civilian population.  They also had such a strict "defend the homeland" policy, that they rarely left their "territory".  Had they firebombed DC, they likely could have forced the north to come to terms of peace.  Sherman later did that to Atlanta in 1864-1865 during his "march to the sea".  

Preemptive strikes work, when done correctly.  Imagine the Union's reaction to WDC, NYC, Boston, and Phillidephia being razed to the ground.  It would have been humiliating to the northern efforts to contain the rebels, and likely would have worked. 




 Only because y'all fired on fort sumpter.  They were within 3 weeks of being starved out.  Had y'all not fired upon it, it's likely that you could have left, (and then failed). 









 You mean war of southern independence?  A civil war is where 2 or more factions are trying to control an existing government power.  If the war of southern independence was a civil war, so was the American revolution.  The difference is we won, and the south lost.  That's it. 




 I just think it's a symbol of a failed nationstate.  (because it is).  A failed revolution that had 13 "states", and couldn't fight for shit because they were so damned isolationist.  I wouldn't fly that flag, any more than I would fly the flag of the USSR.  It's gone folks.  At least the USSR existed for about 75 years.  The CSA was just piss in a windstorm.  When I see the confederate flag, I don't associate it with racism, I associate it with "somebody's mad that they lost".  Fuck, might as well flag of Yugoslavia for what the CSA flag represents. 









 
Want a good movie that deals with this?  [The Man From Earth](http://www.hulu.com/watch/517822)  I give it PG13 rating.  Not because of violent bloody scenes, but because I don't think a 13yo or younger would understand it.  Adult situations.  It's one of the best movies I've ever watched. 




 I could probably do 1000 years.  Hell, I've already lost all the people I really cared about except for one, so why not?  I'd like to see how society evolves over the next millennia, that would be sort of cool actually.

 I think I would rather just get my ass kicked than live with an eternity with .... literally nothing.  If I had my "bat belt" as my ex wife called it, I'd just pull out my gun and end it.  And it would be different than just not existing, because you're conscious the whole time and you can think of every waking moment.  Imagine looking out to see .... nothing. but you're fully conscious of it.  I'd be begging for my sidearm at that point, and I would only need 1 round.

**EDIT:**  You would go insane.  Look up sensory deprivation.  Most people can last about 72 hours from what I've researched.  I don't mean lock up, I mean total sensory deprivation.  That is the ultimate form of torture.  At least I've practiced for sucking dick by deep throating hot dogs.  (Yes, I know that's super gay, [esp when doing it in front of my dad and he questioned my sexuality]). 




 Until that one day that the last proton decays, and there's nothing left but you,  Alone, in the universe.  Everything ceases to exist outside of quantum particles, but you continue to live  .... forever ... with nothing to see or experience, or do.  Imagine being locked in your room as a kid when getting punished with no TV or radio or power.  Now make it last forever.  But there's no bed to lay in and cry, no walls, no floor.  Just nothing, and ... more of nothing.  Then it never ends  because it's .... forever.  Terrifying prospect to be left alone for ever with literally nothing but your thoughts. 




 [It's a chameleon.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmcA9LIIXWw) You get it by coming and going, and stringing people along like in your golden dreams. :D 




 Can you imagine that?  "The Last Perfect Day", and then it gets hotter, the sun gets brighter, and then it becomes insufferably hot, and then all of the organic matter around you starts wilting and dying off, then spontaneous combustion becomes a very real thing, then the world literally catches fire., then the atmosphere is blown off into space, and all of the water on the planet.  Plate techtonics break down because the surface is molten, and the planet it turned into a ball of molten rock, and then completly engulfed by the Sun, and vaporised.  

The only trace of the Earth left would be a slightly higher iron and sulphur and sodium content in the sun.  Then the sun collapses, and earth is gone forever, (and venus and mercury).  Mars would likely survive as a burnt out husk like mercury is today, and the rest of the planets would be unaffected.  I think I would rather just shoot myself. 




 Want to be alive when the sun engulfs the Earth in about 5 billion years, want to live to see the sun get so large that the atmosphere is blown away into the vacuum of space, the oceans boil off, and the mountains melt? Then the sun expands, and engulfs the earth, only to vaporize it? And you get to see it all? Living to see everything you ever known, cared about, and ever seen, just engulfed and obliterated by the dying sun?

How about in a googolplex years, when the very atomic structure of the Universe ceases to exist.  Not even electrons would exist, and the only thing existing would be some photons, some quantum particles and you?  Alone, forever, in a universe with nothing, and you still live on.  That would be hell, knowing that the entire universe you know and are familiar with is obliterated, but you keep on living on ..... forever.

I think I would rather eat a bullet than see that. I take solace knowing I will never exist to see that day. The thought of eternal life is far more terrifying than knowing that yes, one day, I just stop existing. 




  I wish ... I'd live forever

 We all die.  Shit happens.  It's unavoidable.  It's nothing to be feared, after I die, I won't even exist, so why fear what I can't feel, sense, taste, or touch?  Might as well feat the Space Jews stealing all the moon money.  It just makes no sense to fear death.  Hell, my house could collapse on me right now and crush me under a couple of hundreds of tonnes right now.  The USSR could launch now, and vaporise me in 45m.  Why fear what I can't control?

To put a reverse on an old country song, it's not the thought of being dead, it's the thought of dying that is sort of frightening.  If the soviets launch, well, I won't feel a damned thing.  I'll just be non-existent one millisecond.  If my house collapses for some reason, I might be trapped for several days before expiring.  I think I would rather die in a thermonuclear explosion. 




 Handjobs and blowjobs seem to get the highest reviews. :) 




 I ... don't even know how that works.  I think you got it backwards there dude.  O.o 




 Called out behind the pump house and beat so bad that I couldn't move.  Yeah, getting "behind the woodshed" is a very real thing in rural communities.  And then getting punched because you're crying like a little bitch, and told not to tell anybody or it will only be worse, and shaking because you're crying so hard and just want it to stop.  Yay childhood, I guess.  I'd slap me, but I think that was completely uncalled for. 




 That was the first time I was let loose on my own with a tank and a torch.  I got told to "go burn weeds", so I did.  I ended up burning a lot more than the weeds in the ditch.  I fucked up.  I admit it.  Thanks for making me cringe and reflexively cower down for 2s, dad. :(  You try costing the ranch $1.4M, and lost wages for your men for 2 years. 




 I **think** I had a good reason to get my ass kicked.  I cost the ranch almost 2 years of working salary.  Never give your kid a blowtorch, EVER.  Esp one hooked up to a 5ga propane tank, and you cost the ranch quite a bit of money.  Explosions aren't fun when you're running from it resulting a fire that you were told to start. O.o 




 Yes, it was, that's why I got hit.  We lost 3 cattle and one combine.  All because "Hey, let's let a 14 year old kid have a blowtorch and put him on weed control in late august".  Yeah, I fucked up, but the should have never handed me the blowtorch in the first place.  I wouldn't give my daughter a blowtorch with a propane tank and say "go kill weeds".  Why did they? 




  I started a field fire because I was trying to burn off some weeds, and it got out of control. That was a $1.4M loss to the ranch. I deserved it.  3 cattle, and one combine were lost in that fire, (and a couple hundred acres of wheat).  I fucked up.

Yeah!  Let's trust a 14 year old kid with a blow torch in late august.  That's a good idea!  (not)

 Which is why it should be reinstated, but specifically targeted to prevent incompetent people from voting.  Race should not be an issue.  Black people are just people like you and I.  Hell, for all I know you're black,  I honestly don't give a shit about race at all.  However, incompetent people should be prohibited from voting. 




 I know.  It has probably happened.  I'm not against competency tests, but they should be in English at a 12th grade level of comprehension.  The Voting Rights Act of 1965 had good intentions, (prohibiting discrimination based upon race as a requisite to voting), but it had the unintended consequences of "Let idiots vote too!".  Did you know that now, a completely illiterate down's syndrome person has as much sway in national politics as you and I?  I'd be for in favor of repealing the 26th amendment, and returning the voting age to 21 years of age. 




 I'm familiar with that joke, (that isn't to far off).

A black man walks into the sheriff's office to register to vote in Alabama.  He goes to pass the literacy test.

The Sheriff says "Can I help you son?"

The black man says "Yes sir, I came to pass my literacy test to vote."

The sheriff hands him a newspaper in Chinese, and asks the black man "Can you read that?"

The black man looks at the paper and sadly states, "Yes sir, I can.  It says here that "No niggers going to vote in this county."  He turns and walks out the door after setting down the paper on the sheriff's desk. 




 Yes.  A person should need to pass a US Citizenship test before being allowed to vote.  If you don't know how your government works, I honestly think you deserve no say in how it is run.

*"An educated citizenry is a vital requisite for our survival as a free people."*

 Human trafficking. That is a fucking horrible crime, and the perpetrators should be shot in the face. 














 Only 32 years old, but my "best gift" that I ever got was a meal that I didn't have to cook.  It was from my step mom, and I was mind boggled that she even thought of that.  I know she knows that I don't like cooking, but that was nice.  I wasn't expecting it at all. 




 I'm 32.  Nope.  I should have been in vegas by now, with a paid off house and a 3 year old paid for truck. 




 Not be such a pillock in my HS years, and end up married to my HS crush.  Also, not drop out of school after 9/11, and refuse to re-enroll in college.  Not drink and drive, avoid debt like the plague.

 The Hanson brothers. 




 I didn't have my truck with me, so I "stole" the buggy.  If I had my truck on my store run, I wouldn't have kiped it in the first place.  Or do you mean on the way back?  Because I didn't think of it?  "buggies have wheels, so I can tow it" is all I was thinking. 




 Since there's no "Ask a PO" thread, do you like looking at dude's junk while giving a UA, or is it part of the job?  And why back in 2008 was I told to disarm before going into the can?  If I wanted to shoot you, I wouldn't wait until the can to do it. 




 It's not a good idea to shoot automatic weaponry from the road into the field because you're testing it.  Do it from your own land where it's safe. 




 Nope.  I don't even have a functional door bell.  Knock. 









 Get naked in front of a mirror, gently fellate yourself, while tenderly fingering your hole, and softly weep. 




  I was listening to the scanner, and I heard, "We found 191 shells, but no clue where they came from"  I heard radio chat about trying to find the guy, (me), but "we can't pin it down, there's no other reports of FA fire countywide".  Me and my dad kept quiet.   We saw the SWAT van come and leave, and stayed up just watching them roll on by.  All because somebody in a 98 Camaro called the cops om me. (according to the scanner).  Needless to say, I got the fuck out of dodge. 




 I honestly think bill said "fuck it", because for something that I don't know why that the red and blues were turned on.  I honestly don't know why he was getting stopped.  But he outran it, and after hiding a while, we just went home.  He also rolled up on me for firing a AKS on a rural road.  Umm, oops.  He just lectured me about not discharging my rifle on public roads, and I might want to leave now because the sheriff was coming over in a SWAT van to investigate reports of FA fire.  I left.  Fuck this.  They didn't find anything. :D  I guess getting reports of some dude standing in the middle of the road waving cars by and firing into a field doesn't go over too well. O.o

**EDIT:**  I had a police scanner at the time. 




 A man is a man as far as I'm concerned.  Want to be gay?  More power to you. I honestly couldn't care less.  It makes no difference to me (other than more chicks for me).  So how did it come to represent the "homosexual movement", and not just "I don't care what race/color/sex/sexual orientation you are". 




 Nope. I haven't smoked for like 5 weeks now.  Pot isn't that great. (yay for being legal in WA, I guess?) 




 I honestly don't give a shit if you're not gay for me.  Just like I wouldn't some random chick hitting on me, I don't want dudes to either.  You like men?  I honestly don't care.  But I don't think I'll fly that flag ever, because people might get the wrong idea why I'm flying it.  I would only fly it to signify "I don't care", not because I'm gay. 




 Maybe.  I've seen Alaskan State Troopers, yeah, he always gets caught, but it is conceivable that they would be able to find a way out.   My dad told me about his adventures in the 70's, and he seemed to get away quite a lot.  He ouran bill once when I was with him. (we had 4wd, he didn't so my dad took off across the fields and got away).  I thought it was cool when I was 13.  We parked next to a diesel truck in some random barn and waited for 45 min. :)  We got out no problems. :)  He even went to the extent of following the tracks, and keeping in them so it looked like the truck made it.  We hid in the rafters. 




 So cops basically walk behind somebody the same reason I do?  (self preservation, and I can GTFO of the way if shit goes down) 




 So why did the cop follow me to my car the one time that I got mixed up with a prowler, and he wanted me to show him my rigs?  It made no sense, but I complied.  He wanted to see what I owned, so I showed him.  I didn't get it.  I actually said "these are keys, it's not a knife or a gun or anything".  That was the strangest encounter ever.  I didn't even know why they thought I was a prowler.  I was just sitting on my porch drinking beer and listening to my radio.  I was confused why they even looked at me, (and why I had to show them my rigs). 




 I know that, I don't let anybody behind me for that reason, but why not next to the side, and walk next to them on the opposite side where you carry your sidearm/knife?  ( I assume LEO carries a knife, because I do). 




 I honestly don't care if you're gay.  I like chicks, you like dudes.  Yay!  More women for me! :D  But why fly a flag at all, instead of simply not giving a shit?  I'm straight, and I know that not all chicks want to fuck me, or get down on her knees and suck me off.  Why are gays regarded as any different? 




 But wouldn't that give the dude they are following an advantage?  What's to stop him from just running and dive into nearby bushes? 




 Why not next to their side?  Wouldn't that give a better tactical advantage if they decided to run or whatever? 




 I guess I should have specified "homosexual". 




 If that's the case, why not fly it to say "I don't care whether you're black or asian, or gay.  I don't give a shit"?  Instead of it being exclusive to the "gay movement"?  If I flew a rainbow flag, people wouldn't think "I accept diversity in population", they would think I'm gay. 









 I kiped a buggy, because I had to walk home 2 miles, and there's no way I'm going to haul 15 bags of groceries around with me.  Yes, I returned it the next day.  That had to be a sight to see me driving back with it.  A truck with a buggy hooked up to the hitch, and driving 35 to the store. :D  I bet whoever was behind me was wondering why I was towing a buggy. :D 




 When she's crushing your hand squeezing out the kid, do like you would with a man, and meet force with force.  As they squeeze tighter, you squeeze tighter.  Failure to do this will only give you a fucked up hand, and you're not going to hurt her.  I had to grip back on so tight that my fingers were turning white, but I was uninjured, (and so was she).  You're going to need a pretty strong grip.

 Just be understanding.  Boys can be bullied by girls, and even 14 years later, it has cascading effects even in my daily life.  Why else do you think that I'm 32, and only got married because I knocked the chick up, and have only "dated" 3 times in my whole life?  I'm still borderline afraid of females. 




 I was a teen in the 90's.  My dad was a teen in the 60's, and graduated HS in 1972.  I graduated in 2001. 




 Well shit, so much for that idea.  I know it would be devastating to the developed world.  (how many carbureted cars are still on the road?)

 Hence the preliminary HEMP strike. Detonate it about 50 miles up, and bye-bye power in the DPRK. No electric power means no retaliation. Unfortunately, it would take out ROK too, and part of Russia and China too.

 Somehow she found me on somewhere, and I'm still honestly afraid of her.  I'm a  32 year old man for fuck sakes, and I'm still afraid.  She doesn't hit anymore (except her kids), but I did meet her twice.  I'm still afraid.  I feel like It's the 90's all over again.

 I've been driving on the family ranch since I was 11 years old, and my dad even let me use his low ride.  So since 1994.  I pulled up to my grandpa's the first time, and he said "Does your dad know you're using his rig?  Is he going to hit you?"  I said "nope, he just said don't take it off the ranch, and I'm not.  He won't hit me if I don't take it on the public roads".  My grandpa just said "OK, be careful, and don't wreck!"  But he didn't care after that.  He knew I would show up in my dad's low ride 1972 Chevy Luv with a 3 speed tranny. :) 




 Oh hell no.  I throw it out, as in the middle of the street where cars will run over it, so not a problem anymore.  The cars will put it out for me, and smash it into little bits.  No litter.

 Correct.  WWII would have likely never happened.  (or at around 1960 between the USSR and USA, but it would have been conventional since the atomic bomb would have not been developed in this ATL).  But if the USA remained COMPLETELY neutral in WWI, both the USA and USSR would have likely remained isolationist, so we might still be referring to WWI as "The Great War".  

Fuck, I feel like I'm on /r/HistoryWhatIf 




 Actually, I think it was US Intervention in WWI that caused WWII.  Had the USA honored both the german blockade of the UK, and UK's blockade of mainland Europe, (no trade at all, we completely stay out), WWII would have been completely avoided. 














 No shit, use a dash mount, and have it direct wired using one of those tape adapters, and just use it like a stereo.  That's how I have my phone set up when I do use it as a jukebox.  But I only change the station when I'm stopped, (or waiting at a red light).

 I just call that "putting out a cigarette where something flammable might be".  Other than that, I'll just crush it under my boot, or throw it out, (if I know there's no flammable material around) 




 Assist in station to station calls, collect calls, emergency disconnect of a phone in use so you can call them, get you to dispatch before 911 existed, look up phone numbers for you, authorize payphones by listening for the "bong" sound of a dime or quarter being dropped in, etc.

 What if the ride is 50 minutes, and the passengers are a car-pool of workers just trying to go to work, calling their boss because of traffic?  Should the vehicle have to come to a complete stop before they can make any call, and force them to either come in late, or be tardy because they can't pull back into traffic safely?  16 year olds work, eh? 




 That would infringe on the passenger's convenience to make a call.  They aren't driving. 




 Yes, but if "disabled after a certain speed/below an age" were implemented, how does the system know?  I was 15 when I placed that call. 




 And hyponatremia. 




 Wouldn't work.  What if the passenger needs to make a call?  What if, like in 1998 when I was coming up the lewiston hill, somebody coming the other way down flashes his lights at you because you think there is a cop ahead, so you slow down; then you come around a corner and A VEHICLE IS HEADING RIGHT FOR YOU ON A DIVIDED HIGHWAY! 

I cut off a semi, and picked up on my phone, and called 911 to let them know about it, then got on my CB (chan 9), and let "ALL HEADING SOUTHBOUND ON US 95!  ALL HEADING SOUTHBOUND ON US 95!  THERE IS A LARGE VEHICLE HEADING NORTH IN THE SOUTHBOUND LANES ON THE LEWISTON HILL!  I REPEAT!  THERE IS A LARGE VEHICLE HEADING IN THE SOUTHBOUND LANES TO NORTH!  DIVIDED HIGHWAY!!"  

Within 10s of my call, I could hear the sirens behind me.  That was a legitimate emergency, so you bet your fucking ass I'm using my phone and CB!

Yes, I missed him by less that 30 feet.  That was fucking scary.  Had it not been for my phone and radio, who knows how large that accident would have been.  Technologically prohibiting cell phone use in a moving vehicle isn't a solution, education is. 




 I came across it, and I had to turn it off.  My wife was texting and driving with me in the car.  If she was my daughter, I would have taken her damned phone and thrown it out the window.  I made my wife watch it.  She went white at the head on scene, and started crying at the kid asking mommy and daddy to wake up, and almost puked at the dead baby scene.  I'm thinking about taking her to a wrecking yard and seeing in person what happens when you text and drive.  Somebody in HS did that to me when she heard I was racing on busy public streets.  I got drug out to her truck, and she forced me to actually open up the vehicle and take a look inside.  She then shoved my head in and "smell that?  That's death.  That's what you're causing by racing on US195!  Keep up what you're doing, and you're going to be smelling this!  You will be the cause! This vehicle was going 131 on US195!  Do you want to see who they hit?"  All I could say was "no." and sounded like a child that just got beat by his mom.  I was crying at that point, and she drug me back to her truck and we went back to school.  I never raced on the highway again.  (I'll race on empty ones, but not that one, it's just too busy, and I might kill somebody).  There's nothing like the smell of curdled blood and some hair and skull to remind you DON'T RACE ON OPEN ROADS!.  I got hit after she heard about that, and I deserved it.

**TL;DR:** DON'T RACE!  DON'T TEXT AND DRIVE! 




 You asked for it (NSFW)  "I want mommy and daddy to wake up!"  How do you like seeing dead babies?

 Alcoholics under going DT's experience tactile hallucinations, (and meth heads)  "ants crawling under my skin".  That would be a tactile hallucination. 




 Have you ever heard of Schizophrenia? They "hear voices that don't seem to be there in person".  That is an auditory hallucination. 




 Yes.  Look up auditory hallucinations, and tactile hallucinations.  You can even "taste sounds".  Look up synesthesia.  




 No, because of that's what the Several United States of America are called.  (before that, we had the Articles of Confederation.  The constitution was ratified in 1791). 




 I don't think physical operators exist outside of calling (area code) 555-1212.  (I think the kids call it 411).  I know what they used to do, but I don't think they exist anymore. 




 Like I was her own kid.  She was raising me since I was 2yo, and I would rather run to my step mom than my birth mom for help.  My sister and I were the only kids "she ever had".  She got pregnant in 1998 because she wanted a "kid of her own", but changed her mind 6 weeks into it, because "I already have kids".  

My birth mother is fucking useless, but my step mom stepped in several times in grade school and raised hell because I was coming home with marks on me.  She told my dad to stop sending me over to joe's house because he would beat me.  My step mom basically **WAS** my mother, and did all of the things moms do, and dad did what dads do.  

My birth-mother was a negligent parent, and had no reason to even have me for once a week until I was 7.  Although I call her by her first name, she's "mom" to me.  There are billions of people called "mom", or "mum", but only one XXXXX in my mind.  So I call her by her first name, (and have all my life), as a sign of respect.  She only slapped me twice. 




 No.  Their visual cortex has not developed sight, and wouldn't know how to process it.  All of the other hallucinations would still be there.

 My father made me pay my own insurance.  Because I used to be hell on wheels in my 1977 Chevrolet Impala Coupe, (that I dropped a 350 in with dual quads, Yay 4MPG!) I had so many speeding tickets, and "Excessive display of horsepower" tickets that I paid $169/mo in insurance, and had a probationary license.  (I was getting stopped about once every 3 months).  I rolled my car when I was 14 years old, (been driving on the family ranch since 12), and got into my head on collision at 16 years old.

 And also if you're broke down along the highway, they'll change your tire, or give you a gallon of gas, or give you a ride into town.  I know police have utility beyond speeders (or dui busts), on the highway, but I'm asking about how they used to monitor speed before radar guns existed.

 So, did they just drive around in circles all day, or??  How would this work?  Did they just go after vehicles that looked like they might be speeding? 




 I live in a duplex.  I have 3 bedrooms, and 2 baths.  I have 2 designated parking spots, and W/S/G included with the rent.  I use one of the bedrooms for a shop, and the other bedroom is completly empty.  I even keep the door shut to that room, and the vent is shut off in that room.  I have 2 floors.  The bedrooms (and 1 bath), are upstairs; and the living room, "dining room" (that I just use to make my living room bigger), kitchen, laundry room, and small downstairs bathroom are located downstairs.  I live in what would be classified as a semi-urban area.  I'm on College hill in Pullman WA.

 I wasn't trying to kill myself, and I don't think I'm fat and ugly because I'm fat, and if I only weigh less I'll be better looking.  I was just feeling like shit, so I didn't eat for a while, and then once a week passed and I was feeling OK again, I was waiting for the "I'm hungry" signal again to eat, but it never came.  Hence 19 days with no food, and ending up in the hospital for seizures.  

All my step mom, (that is basically my mother since she and my father raised me since I was 2), was "Why do you always have to learn things the the hardest way possible, I have tried to tell you numerous times about the importance of eating, but no, you had to go get yourself hospitalized for starvation."  That didn't make me feel very good.  Another friend besides the one who threatened to tell her mom told me that she has a room that I can move into and if she needs to treat me like one of her kids, she will. :(

I never realized how many people cared what I do, even if I did it completely unintentionally, and didn't intend on killing myself through starvation.  It's not like I intended on passing out in the middle of WM and being hauled off to the hospital.  My truck was still in the WM parking lot when I was discharged, and I left the windows down and the keys in the ignition.  Yes, my truck was still there, (but the interior was wet because it rained).  Thank dog my seats are leather, I was just able to wipe it off and sit down to drive it away.  

I don't think I have anorexia, but yes, I have 2 appointments with mental health professionals, an appointment with my physician, and now I have to take Keppra, and make an appointment with a neurologist because I had a seizure. :(  One good thing about Keppra, my hand tremors have stopped, and now I don't have dry heaves in the morning when I wake up, so it is doing some good. :) 




 Nobody who has had "Near Death Experiences" has died. 




 Yeah, you get high out of your mind by a DMT dump as your brain is dying, then you have euphoric pleasure and everything is awesome, (or intriguing, or scary), and then you die.  Show me a person who has a flat EEG and EKG, and came back from the death, and I'll show you ET.  Medical proof needed.  Thier body must have assumed room temperature.  (complete death).  "Near death" is not "death".  I was "near death" when I collapsed because of starvation.  I didn't see shit. 




 So have I, it's called Salvia Divinorum 20x extract.  Want to be transported to a different planet?  I have some shit that will take you there for about 20 minutes.  Still doesn't make it real though.  (PSST:  DMT dump; your brain gets you high to make death pleasurable).  Hell, I have a KILO of it.  I can send you so far out, you forget what Earth even is.  Does that make drug-induced psychosis real?  Of course not.

 Wal-Mart. 




 The first two things in your last paragraph did happen.  My friends are pissed off at me and concerned.  One is threatening to tell her mom who is a refugee from the Viet Nam war.  She'd be pissed off because she fled that shit, and here I am in the USA doing it to myself.  

I've already seen the documentaries on TV, (I'd leave too).  I really don't want to hear a first hand account of them boiling bark just to make soup so they can eat *something*.  She says if I get much worse, she's going to tell her, and I'll likely get forced to eat. :( 




 I sort of have to.  I got prescribed Keppra to prevent seizures.  :(  I have to make an appointment within the next 14 days.  A good part about the medicine is that the shakes in my hands since I've had forever, and my dry heaves that I've been having in the morning for the last decade are now gone.  :) 




 I felt like shit for a week, so I just didn't bother with it since I felt like if I ate, whatever went down would come up. Then after a week, I felt OK, and I wasn't hungry, so I just didn't eat. I figured I would eat when I felt hungry, (like I usually do). That hungry feeling just never came, so I didn't eat. Wrong decision. I had to get IV feed for a day because I physically could not eat for the first day. The second day, I tried eating, and tried to eat a cup of clam chowder, a small saucer of apple sauce and a soda. I couldn't finish it. The day of discharge, I was eating a normal sized meal for a 12 year old, (half a plate of spaghetti), but still got full. I still can't polish off a whole can of denty moore's beef stew. I can only eat about half of it.

Now my friends are pissed at me, and one is threatening to tell her mom who is a Viet Nam refugee because she outran that shit, and here I am "in the land of the plenty" doing it to myself.  She'd be pissed, and give me a first hand account of how bad it was there.  I've seen the documentaries, (I'd leave too on an inner tube), so I really don't want to hear a first hand account of it.  Her mom would be pissed, and would probably force feed me.

 I was recently in the hospital because I had a seizure in WM, (turns out you can't not eat for 19+ days and expect to function normally), and collapsed to the floor.  I remember getting batteries, standing up, and then waking up in an ambulance.  Then passing out again.  Then getting told to strip in the ER and put on a gown, (my chain too).  Then "you make me feel drunk", and then waking up in a hospital bed.  Did I have any "OOBE", or anything between those periods of consciousness?  Nope.  Nothing.

 *"Sir, we at Inland Telephone serve the city 60 miles away, and have the same lines, so we can give you local calling rates at $0.10/min.  However, the house served 2 miles away from you is run by GTE, and you have to run through our switches to connect you to ATT, which connects you to the competitor's line.  We have to pay a connection fee twice, so we pass that charge on to you.  If you like, we can set you up with a 200 minute LD plan for only $19.95/mo."*

NOW LETS DO THE MACARANA!  :D 




 Remember not having to dial the area code to call long distance within the area code?  I was pissed when we had to start dialing the area code to call Pullman.  Go figure, now I can do exactly this with my cell phone, but long distance doesn't really exist anymore.  (well, TMO still has regional calling, and small regional carriers, but nobody else).  

I remember having to dial a code to roam, then turn off my phone for 15 min, then turn it back on.  Billed at $2.50/min to roam.  Then when entering your service area, you had to enter ANOTHER code, turn your phone off, and back on again, and now you're not roaming anymore, so it's only $1.00/min. 




 Because in the "days of the landline phone", if you wanted to dial long distance out of your area code, you had to dial 1, (USA National Code), to signal that you need access to the national trunk to ATT.  The format was (011)+(country)+(area)+(phone).  So if you were in England, and wanted to call Moscow ID, it would be 011+1+208+882+4571.  But if you're in Colton WA, (since it is in the same country, it would just be 1+208+882+4571.  There also used to be other trunk codes such as 00 to relay by satellite. Cellular phones, (for domestic calls), automatically insert the 1, so you don't have to.  Remember station to station calls?  $2/min in the 90's.  Hell, I bet you're too young to remember long distance, and 10-10-xxx codes dialed before the number. :)

They actually still exist for international calls:

 How about TWC? 




 Dude has a friend who found out, and her mom is from viet nam, and not only outran the war, but also starvation.  She'd be pissed off if she heard about the dude being too lazy to cook "in the land of plenty" and emanciating himself like was common in viet nam during the war when they had no choice.  Dude doesn't want friend's mom to find out. 




 But why an IV drip of saline and nutrients because for the first 24 hours the dude can't physically eat at all, (but somehow still has to shit because of the IV feed), (and needs help to the john because he's too weak to walk by himself), and not allowed out of bed unattended for 2 days).  And why did when one of his friends find out is she threatening to tell her, (not the dude's), mom [who is a Viet Nam refugee] exactly what's he did to end in the hospital, and is she going to hit him?  Dude's already seen Viet Nam on TV, and doesn't really want to hear first hand accounts of it. 




 And then when human gains consciousness, he can only eat 1/2 cup of clam chowder, a small saucer of applesauce, and half a soda before being "full" to the point of not being able to physically eat any more; but does better the second day and can eat a normal sized meal for a 12 year old; even though he's a 32 year old man?

 That's why they come with cargo reention straps.  If you strap down your cargo, (properly secure your load), then there is no increased danger. Anything not stapped down will become a flying object and potentially lethal.  It doesn't matter if you're in a 89 Mustang, or a 1997 Blazer LT.  I got injured by my sub flying forward in my 89 mustang, because I didn't have it secured down.

 I was on the tractor because the fields aren't going to plow themselves, and yes, I did fix the fence.  I fucked up, so I had to fix it.  It was just the property line, so I decided to "do it later"  Um yeah, 2 hours later when my dad found out.  I didn't get any punishment beyond having to fix the fence there.  

I wasn't let allowed anywhere near the torch for a year but I did get hit there.  I deserved it.  I'm never using a torch near a dry field again.  After seeing how fast fire spreads, I won't even light my cigarette in the field, because one careless spark, and the whole fucker goes up in flames.

 If I held a pistol to your head, and you refused to convert, then you didn't, so I killed your family members while making you watch, wouldn't you convert?  Oh, and I'd leave behind one of my military escorts to make sure you didn't detract from the faith either.  Detraction = death to the rest of your family, and to you.  Conversion at the point of a sword is very persuasive.

 




 I have a digital converter, and I get 4 channels.  Yay?  PBS, CBS, and ABC.  But ABC is turning off soon.  Mandatory cut off for repeaters.  Hence, I hooked up my TV's to satellite and cable.  I only have cable because I have the exact tools that TWC has, (except for a ladder truck and safety gear). 




 Having to deal with that if I want more than 4 channels, (one I'm about to lose), without cable service.  I can get K40EE, and KLEW too.  Other than that, I get ... PBS.

 Which I am.  Back before the transition, I was basically living **in** an antenna to get decent reception.  I had multiple loops of wire, and strings just to get a decent signal.  I turned my entire room, (and later apartment), into a giant antenna just to watch TV.  Now without using extreme measures like that, I get ... 4 channels), and one of them is going dark at the end of the month.  K40EE is turning off at the end of the month. 




 http://www.tvfool.com/?option=com_wrapper Itemid=29 q=id%3df1f09ad6fb825a

Before the transition, I could get 2,3,4,6,7,10,12,22,24,28,35,40,48.  Now I can get 3,10,12,40.  And K40EE is shutting off in a couple of weeks. 




 I still do use an analog TV upstairs, and did think about it, (my ex gf saw my media collection, and says I have enough to run a station for several years).  I'm not doing it though because I'd get nailed by the FCC. 




 I mean the poor people recruited get no tangible benefit.  I'm not talking about the charity cases reliant on the food bank, but just minimum wage workers that see a local church in town, and decide to go, and then the hat is passed around and you feel like a damned tool if you don't put at least a couple cents in the hat before passing it down the line.  

All for nothing that can't be proven.  (unless you can send cameras to the afterlife).  But there are more Christian denominations than passages in the bible.  Destitute people need the churches for charity works, and I understand it's an out reach program.  But the working poor don't need it.  I'd have no problem with charity drives, like standing in front of a store and passing out fliers that say "food for the needy, this is what we need" to every customer.  Hell, one day, I gave over $200 in food to a church that did exactly that.  (I had extra money that month, so what the hell).  They were kind of surprised when they asked "what's here for us", and I just said "The entire buggy". and walked off.  Somebody did it for me a long time ago when I was in need, so I did it for somebody else that I will never even meet. 




 Then why is my TVFool so shitty?

 You're really going to have a logical discussion with a a 12 year old on why he should watch where he's going when backing up?  Really?  Fuck that.  Make him fix the fence he backed over.  He fucked it up, he fixes it by himself.  Yes, bring him water and food, but "You fucked up, you fix it".  That's completely reasonable.  Burn down 1.4 million dollars of ranch land, and lose some cattle and a barn?  I deserved it.  Never trust a 14 yo kid with a backpack blow torch.  Bad mistakes can happen. Dad running for the tractor and going to make a fireline to save what crops remain then coming home isn't fun.  I should have known better, but it was my first time being let loose by myself with the torch.

Longer term future?  (10+ years), Nothing.

 They are large gaseous objects that gather together under the force of gravitation and electromagnatism.  Then because of the heavy gravitational forces, they collapse upon themselves and form a star and planets.

They are destroyed by the collapse into a formation of several stars, (usually), and they drift away according to the spin that the underwent while the nuclear reaction went critical, and formed planets, and debris and shit.  They are made out of mostly hydrogen and helium, but also a few other elements going all the way down to uranium. 




 Minimum time?  A pico second as measured by the official time clock in Boulder CO.  Maximum, about 10 billion years from the Hubble.  It means nothing other than we can measure the speed of light, and can see that far back into the past because the speed of light isn't instantaneous.  

FTL is impossible as known to the laws of physics as we currently understand them, but if you can figure a way around it, you'll get to be a billionaire, and win the nobel prize.  

Hypothetically, if you could build a telescope the size of the Moon, and send it out 65M LY away, yes, you could watch the destruction of the dinosaurs.

Fun fact:  It takes about 1.25 seconds to contact the Moon one way, and 15 minutes to mars.  (speed of light is about 299,792,458 m/s)  If the sun burnt out right now, we wouldn't know for about 8 minutes.

 I wasn't trying to shill or troll, I was just trying to have a good time, and I thought everybody would have a good laugh at it.  I guess I failed there.  What started as a joke post very quickly turned into a serious discussion.  I know trolls just post asshole shit to get people angry, but what's a shill? 




 Davey Crocketts are tactile nuclear weapons low yeild. 100T payload.  Set it not to launch, and detonate on a timer, (much like an IED).  Have 4 vans parked in the garage, and one at each exit/entrence.  Blow them both at the same time. Total failure, and explosion.  Wait until noon for mass casualties 70,000 people per building.  Then blame it on some rouge terrorist group from somewhere.

That would work much better than a few dumbasses with box knifes flying airplanes into buildings.  Doing that would cause a complete massive uproar and a move to join the military, and kill whoever they blame it on unseen since forever.  If I wanted to stage a terrorist attack, it wouldn't be too hard as the President, and the effects would be long lasting.  EMP the USA. That would take about 2 days to plan, and cause hundreds of millions of people to die, and decades to fix.  This report was released the same day as the 9/11 commission report.  Yes, they were hiding something, but it wasn't 9/11.

http://www.empcommission.org/

**EDIT:**  It wouldn't even take a semi-automatic weapon to get mass casualties.  Just the stampede effect.  Get a couple dudes into the Superbowl with a string of firecrackers, and shoot off 1 round each from each position.  Set off the strings, and shoot one random person.  Stampede effect, and then the media could blame "maniacs with machine guns" for the thousands of people being stomped to death, when what? 4 people are killed because of hostile action?

That's how to terrorize a population.  Can you imagine that reaction?  Not only several thousand people being injured/killed because of the stampede effect, but also millions of people watching on TV live?  That's the way to do it.  Even if I was planning a terrorist plot, I can think of better shit than 9/11 to do.  The airplanes would only be the start.  Then the car bombs go off at every entrance, then the parking garage bombs would go off, and set trains to explode when the pass under it. 9/11 was run by somebody that didn't know what he was doing. 




 I know exactly how I would do it.  Ever heard of "car bombs", and 2 Davey Crockett misslies planted to detonate at an exact time.  Then forbid examination by presidntial order because it's just too dangerous", and then let FEMA and emergency personell in?  It wouldn't exactly be hard if it were a government consperacy on 9/11. 









 LSD is a hell of a drug. :)  I've seen some pretty wild shit too. :)  But do I think those 2" tall people are truly running this machine that only see as an end table not on drugs?  Nope.  It's just acid man. 




 Nah, I just thougt y'all would get a laugh.  While I hate to quote a blowhard, "Illustrate absurdity by being absurd".  There's a difference between not believing that U93 was taken down by civillians, (doesn't add up, and I'd shoot it down); v. Lizard men living at the center of the earth and Obama is a shape shifter and also the queen of england because you never see them at the same place at the same time) 




 I don't believe that it was a malicious plot that was founded by the bush administration, (too much of an idiot to pull it off), but I honestly do think that United 93 was shot down with justification but credited to the American passengers aboard because to give them a "silver lining in a dark cloud" on that horrific day.  I'd do it to, and they had reason to be shot down.

Building 7 fell down because of the massive fires that were raging in the tower for over 12 hours, and when I think they said "pull it", they were referring to "let it burn and get the hell out".  I didn't see any cranes that day, and it takes several weeks to set up a demo team..  Ever heard of the think known as "collateral damage" from shrapnil?  Shit happens man.  Sometimes that shit sucks, but it's still shit.  Just because you accidently stepped in a cow patty, doesn't mean it was set there on purpose. 




 1 I saw it on facebook and thought it was funny, so I thought y'all would get a laugh from the stupidity.

2.  Sort of, my old HS bully showed up and treats me like I'm her kid (all over again), but that has nothing to do with it

3. Nope.  I just think that the 9/11 people are full of shit.

4.  I wish.

5.  No, I'm not a racist, (by definition, segregation of a group of people based on external appearances or color is racist).

6. No, I do investigation, but I don't believe in fake moon landings, lizard people, 9/11 being operation northwoods in practice, or the Regan fake murder, or all the school shootings were faked by liberals, or that bill clinton was in contact with the mafia, or other bullshit shit.

7. You do have a lot of shit that is worth considering.  I do believe in restricted areas around nuclear power plants, (I've kind of been chased out of one), I believe in Area 51 because I can find it on Google Maps, I think more than one man was behind JFK, (but who), and that if JFK would't have gotten into a pissing contest with the russians, he wouldn't have "saved us" from the missile crisis, and that clinton started Kosovo on purpose to distract from the lewinsky thing).  I think I'm the first one to think up the last two, but I think it's true.  United 93 was shot down by the USAF.  Just listen to the tapes.  That's all you have to do.  Who is that executive aircraft?  It's the USAF. 









 Me light m1000, me throw and seek cover.  I don't want to be anywhere around those when they go off.    What did that dude light off with the burnt arm?  

M1000's are very dangerious, and I won't hold them beyond to light it, and then I throw it "away from me", and duck for cover.  I set one off last night, and the closest cover was behind my door.  I didn't even get to see it blow up, so I don't know why I lit it at all.  I cracked the sidewalk though.  Oops.  I lit it and realized "I'm holding dynamite!"  Oh shit!"  I threw it and ran. 



















 jacking, boosting, 5 finger discount, stealing, etc. 









 Drove drunk. 




 Terminator 2.  I thought it was boring.  For a while I thought "R" meant "Really dumb".  I was 8, and didn't get it.  Holy shit, most of y'all weren't alive when I watched this movie the first time. 




 Christmas day, 1991 to be exact. 




 The USSR would admit they are full of shit and don't stand a chance against the USA. 









 Holy shit!  What did that guy fire off?  That's disturbing!  I'm trying very hard not to puke right now. 




 Blind luck I guess.  I only shoot fireworks off holding them because my dad did, and he survived fine.  Roman candles have a kick, but as long as you keep it well away from your head, it's fine.  Powder burns from bottle rockets are painful, but the rockets are fucking painful. 




 Ever seen 3 bottle rockets go off at once.  That hurts, but it was cool to see. :)  I shoot them out of my hand. :)  (yes, I know they aren't called hand rockets or roman candles for a reason)  Yes, I hold those too. 




 Oh, I did, believe me.  My right hand still hurts, and I'm lucky I didn't lose it.  A mortar exploded on me (twice), a bottle rocket had a FTL, and just blew up on me, and I had a premature detonation on a firecracker.  I think I'm explosived out for the next year.  Oh, a roman candle kind of blew up on me too.  I dove for the nearest cover, (a parking berm), and got missed by what looked like an inch.  It's amazing how slow detonations are when you're running for your very life after yelling "FIRE IN THE HOLE!  RUN NOW! and running yourself.I made it 5ft before I had to jump behind the nearest thing for safety.  I'm lucky I'm alive after tonight's escapades. 




 Some dude just traded me a smoke and some fireworks for a beer.  I took him up on the offer. :)  I told him, "just don't kipe my fireworks or radio."  He was impressed with my radio setup and looked at it with his phone flashlight.  He was rather impressed. :).  I intended to give it to him for free, but he insisted on giving me a beer in trade.  I took him up on the offer. :) 




 Because I can, and know how to use my armament?  Havent really thought through "what if the soviets launch, and you have 15m before impact.  1.  Get them to safety.  2.  Lock the door.  3.  Train them somehow in a fallout shelter??  4  take back our town. 




 well I have an armament for other reasons, (havent exactly though about how to train my neighbors though in case of "bird away", yet though, but yes, mostly for fun, and rounds are expensive. 




 http://www.eadassociates.com/fa-235-508.pdf

They go first. 




 Only if 7.5" limp (according to my tape measure), is small.  I think I'm rather well endowed, and your dad does too. :D 




 Esp since I'm not in a war zone, but am armed to the teeth like I am in one.  I have enough armament to equip a fireteam.  Now to go watch explosives. :) 




 68 magazines and 5 drums.  I still have a few magazines unloaded, because if I get into that big of a firefight, I have a severe problem that I really cant fix. 




 I have over 1500 rounds ready to go, all loaded into magazines and 5 drums.  It would literally take me 2s to get it into fire mode.  (cock the handle and take it off safety, (but not the middle position because I don't need suppressive fire).  It would only take so long because I'd have to reach to my right and get it. 




 Somebody did that to me, and I would shoot that fucker out of the sky.  AKM v. civilian drone.  I wonder who's going to win? 




 You've never been on an aeroplane? 









 Today is my favorite holiday, because explosives. :) 









 Nope.  I don't even own any.  Yeah, my sex life is non-existent beyond Mrs Lefty Palmy and Righty Handy. 




 Yeah, plot line is "dude is scared out of his mind and thinks we're about to be vaporized, so he runs naked outside of his house to the neighbors thinking we only have 15m to get to shelter".

Then the porn ends badly with 15 people standing around seeing his bum and pillock flapping in the breeze while he walks home. 




 Good point.  I still don't like it when the air-raid siren goes off.  Last time it did, I ran out butt fucking naked to figure out what's going on.  It was only a drill, (obviously).  I'm sure the people didn't like it much seeing my pillock and pounding on thier door to let them know "WE HAVE INCOMING!"  He came out with me, and listened to the siren and announcements.  He just said, "It's a drill you dingus.  Go put some pants on."  I was relieved and embarrassed at the same time.  I know where the evacuation site is if it ever does come.

BTW, I was never allowed dessert.  "If you have enough room for dessert, you have some room for dinner.  Get seconds."  I was only allowed dessert on christmas, thanksgiving, easter, and the 4th of july. 




 They are.  When a vessel goes down, women and children are evacuated first because children are the weakest members of society, and they need their mothers to raise them.  Men are after women and kids because most children can't swim too well, and need to be evacuated.  Women go with the children.  Last, the men, then the crew.  It is the captain's responsibility to make sure everybody is safely off of the ship before leaving himself. 









 It's a "socially acceptable", way of saying "My god", without having to worry about being blasphemous, or violating the third commandment. 




 Because children and women and disabled people are the most vulnerable members of society, and not as strong as a full grown man.  Therefore, they are the first to be evacuated in an emergency scenario 




 Not just A delorean, THE delorean. :) 




 Getting a DUI in 2008. 




 Life is too short to be drunk all day. 




 Go fishing with your dad, he's going to be dead in 7 years, and you're going to regret that you were "too busy" go spend some time with him.  This is going to haunt you the rest of your life.  Work can be put off. 




 The back to the future car. :) 









 Going out in the parking lot across my house with me and my radio, and some beer, and watching the city fireworks show. 




 Remember friendster?  Like that. 




 Me too.  I'm aborting this conversation now. 




 Nope, can't do that.  I'm not a surgeon.  




 That's just so sad I don't know how to comment besides, I'll do it for free if you pay my airfare. :( 




 I tied in psychology, but they don't allow test posts.

My ex wife thinks I should tell my counselor, but I don't know.  I don't want to start any shit over shit that doesn't need to be started.  Should I do like she always said, and just keep my mouth shut?  I really don't want to get her in trouble, because it's been 14 years now.  I should have gotten over it, but my ex wife thinks I still act like a beaten child just trying to stay alive.


I've gotten in contact with my ex-GF from HS, and my ex wife deosn't think it's healthy, and I"ve reverted to a battered child again since contacting her, because I seem to cower when confronted with any conflict, and try and back out anyway that I can.  (well, back in 2012, I literally picked a guy up, and threw him out on the street to end a knife fight, but I only did it because I thought I had to.  It was either that or shoot him).

I think that's just dumb because I'm armed to the teeth, and have several ways to end a threat if I really need to.  I can shoot, I can fight with my knife, I can pole fight, and I can fist fight if I must.  Ideally, I'll never have to do any of it, but I can if I must.

My ex-wife thinks that I have PTSD over my ex GF from HS, but I don't think so, because only raped people and combat people get that. 




 Well, it is a skill that you could learn to make some free extra money on the side.  It's remarkably easy if you have the tools. :) 




 That's why when I smoke with a kid, (or a non smoker), in my truck, I keep the vent on high, and crack the window at least half an inch, and keep the burning part of my smoke outside of the truck.  I do exactly what my dad did, and I never noticed it as a kid, so it must work. 




 Nope.  Just saying that I know how to get free cable.  :) 




 There, you have to have some tools, and the cover of night. ;)  I know exactly how, and have done it a couple of times for friends. :)  Hooking up analog cable isn't exactly hard. 




 Not in most of the Union though. 




 Setting up a TV antenna to get as many channels as you can for free.  /r/cordcutters  




 My cat being in my bedroom with me.  She's my BFF, and I swear she can sense when I'm sick or having emotional issues.  She always cuddles with me, and makes me feel better. :) 




 Same here, but at least I could open up a window.  My mom did it all the time, but my dad always made sure his window was at least cracked so all the smoke would go out. 




 Therefore not illegal.

 What's the RCW? 




 I already did.  It's called coloboma from birth. 




 Just think, now you could potentially have night vision, or zooming vision, or xray vision.  The future is now here.  Now where to get that 100,000 USD to do it, I have no idea. 
























 Blow cigarette smoke in kid's faces, or drive around with a kid, have all the windows up, and chain smoke after engaging the child safety locks on the windows. 




 Yes, I just drove him into town because his car broke down.  They paid me $50 for my efforts. 









 I never got rid of my FDDs until 2011.  Yes, I had more than one. :) 




 That's why he had the nickname "The Intimidator".  Yes, he was a bully on the track. 




 Everything. 




 Pull out my pistol and shoot them in the head. 




 The weather. 




 Slang. 




 Nothing. 




 Well practiced in the Fine Art of Fellatio. 




 I started watching in 93,  Sunday was "raceday", and that was my dads and I "church".  18 Feb 2001 was the last day I ever watched it and was enthusiastic about it.  It didn't work in 2010 when I tried to get back into it.  The Daytona 500 in 2001 was the last complete race I ever watched. 




 Why would you put a full restraint in a semi?  You have a lot of mass, and even a piddly ass seat belt would do you fine.  Do they have semi races now?  O.o  All I know was in my 77 impala (dual quads) dropped in 454, NV4500 with corvette servos. (14s QM)  I couldn't reach shit beyond my stick and wheel.  Yes, I had more power than I would even know what to do with now as a 32 year old man.  Yes, I can still roast my tires if I really want to, (actually not even trying, I've done it by accident), but a 16 year old kid has no business with that much power.  I was getting 301.1 BHP as measured by dynamo.  I "only" have 290 now, according to the spec sheet of the 350 I dropped in with a 700R4 tranny. 




 Seatbelts are obsolete.  And yes, they are more comfortable than a full track setup.  I'd like to see you to even try and change the radio station, or reach your map in a full restraint harness.  Not gonna happen.  The last time I was strapped in, (in 1999), I could reach the wheel, and the stick.  Nothing else.  I may as well have not had a radio.  (well, I was racing, so I didn't use it anyways, but you know what I mean). 




 I was 17 when I saw that race.  My dad turned changed the channel in the livingroom when the wreck happened, so I went to my room to see what was going on and who won.  IIRC, it was about 40m later when the news came that earnhardt was killed.  I ran out of my room as fast as I could, (literally running in the house).  "DAD  EARNHARDT IS DEAD!"  "What?"  "Earnhardt?"  "yeah"  IS DEAD!"  "Bullshit"  "Come into my room, it's on TV now!"  "Oh my god"  Then starts crying just sitting on my bed.  He left.  

Never watched NASCAR again together.  I tried again in 2010, but it just wasn't the same.  The cars looked different, and one of the best drivers in the world got killed.  It just didn't work.  I think I lasted for an hour, and then changed the channel, it just didn't feel right.   









 My ex GF sent me that video after I told her that I have "the need for speed" and asked her about the nearest track.  "Before you go, you might want to watch this.  You were crying to me in HS over it."  I watched it, and now I don't have a "need for speed" anymore.  I completely forgot about it before she reminded me.

Sorry, I was just trying to spread the word, that speed kills, and be responsible.  I know it's not LEO related, but I didn't know where else to post it besides /r/cars 




 Yeah, my ex GF just sent me that video.  Thanks. :(  If you gotta race, keep it on the track, but don't race, because that's still dangerous.  I remember telling my dad that day, he didn't believe me until he came into my room and saw the live news broadcast.  He just sat on my bed and cried, and we never watched NASCAR again.  I tried in 2010, but it just wasn't the same.  One of the best drivers in history got killed, all because of a $140 piece of equipment, (HANS restraining device).  Now I don't want to race at all.  I guess she accomplished her goal.  I had a "need for speed", now I don't.  Pretty morbid video to watch, but better than a "serious discussion". 




 I broke the news to my dad that day, "Earnhardt is dead!". He didn't believe me until he came into my room and watched the broadcast. He was crying. We never watched NASCAR again I remember that day well. He said "what?" I said "Earnhardt?" he said "yeah?" I said " IS DEAD". We walked back to my room, and I still had the TV on, and he watched for about a minute, sat down on my bed, and just started crying. I tried in 2010, but it's just not the same. One of the best drivers ever got killed, and I can't watch it anymore. 









 Why punish the users?  Isn't this a bit like dad having a bad day at work so he comes home to hit his kids? 














 It wasn't something I did, is it?  Great, now I feel like I'm 12 again. :( 




 Not illegal, but SWIM got laughed at a couple of times, and feels like an even bigger ass because SWIM basically said "I saw it on TV" to the aeroport administrator.  And SWIM called because I don't think they would really SWIM SWIM showing up with cutters, and opening the tarmac for a drag race.  SWIM doesn't really want combat patrol coming over the horizon and re-enacting the Saigon surrender, without anywhere to swim off to, or a boat, or a batallion off of shore to flee to) 




 () | ^ | ()  That's what I got to say about that. 




 Because old habits die hard with a vengeance?  (Yay, I actually used a movie title in normal conversation!) 




 That's what my ex GF said, and my mom too.  I thought I could because the BBC does, but Now I'm just trying to find a closed road so I can.  (I'm not going on the aeroport tarmac without explicit permission). 




 The last time I was up there, I saw a jetcar explode.  I'm not really sure I want to go on that track.  Yes, the dude was alive, but barely.  I sort of chickened out after seeing that, and I only had a 10M wait until I was "next up".  Seeing a giant fireball 20M in front of me kind of made me put it into drive and leave the track.  Plus, it would cost me about $50 in gasoline to get up there.   




 Pullman WA.  The nearest one is over 100 miles away in StateLine ID.

**edit:** and now you know why I street drag. My old GF says that my truck is in no condition to race though, and "remember dale earnhardt?  He was a professional driver."  I remember that race well, thanks  Killed with 4 laps to go during the daytona 500 in 2001. 




 God damn it.  Even exhibition permits (close down streets and race), are $175/hr.  My old GF says that I should just let it go, and if she catches me me going to have a "very very serious discussion" if I do it unlicensed. :(

That explains why top gear can do it but I can't! :)  I thought I could because top gear does.  Nope. 




 SWIM = Someone Who Isn't Me.  You probably don't know because you don't go to https://drugs-forum.com/forum/ 




 OK, I can't rent the aeroport either.  :(  Any closed roads around? 




 Shit.  That explains it.  The lady on the phone just laughed at SWIM and said "I can't let you do that". and started laughing again.  SWIM even told her about Top Gear, and they race on tarmac all the time, but that generated even more laughter. O.o.
