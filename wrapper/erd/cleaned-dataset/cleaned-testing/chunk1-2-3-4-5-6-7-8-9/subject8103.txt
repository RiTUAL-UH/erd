 You didn't specify what type of order you're making.  You can't really make an order like you described.  The closest thing would be a limit order, in which case as soon as the order is submitted, it is executed at the current bid price (essentially converted to a market order), since the current price is above your limit price.  There's no scenario I know of in which what you proposed would have any impact on the stock's price, from a pure price point of view.  

That said, if you have a large amount of stock that you unload, that volume alone might will usually have an impact on the stock's price.  That's why it's important to watch institutional investors, since they generally invest much larger sums of money into equities.  So, for example, when they start buying $FB because it recently got added to the S P, you can expect to see a positive impact on the price. 




 Investing is like cooking...every chef has a different style.  
Start slow and develop a sense of your risk tolerance.  
Knowledge is power...start reading the internet voraciously about anything and everything related potential investments.  You might think you know tech sector, but understanding how a stock is traded (the "technicals") is not the same thing as a company's fundamentals.
 




 "you know nothing, John Snow..." 


































 Don't give up.  Investing/trading/gambling is as much about learning how to lose money as it is learning how to make money.  The key is to not let the feat get to you and instead to continue educating yourself to make better entry/exit decisions next time.   

Learn what these terms mean:
1) stop limit order
2) short squeeze

you bought into naked long equity positions in $TSLA and $TWTR right as they hit the peak of a short squeeze.  If you had at least put in standing stop limit orders, you could have limited your loss.

When you enter a position, you can put in a standing One-Cancels-All order, in which you can post both stop limit order (in case of loss), and a limit order (for capping gain).  If one gets executed, the other is cancelled.  This way for each position you enter, you have defined exits in both directions.  Might be a good start so that you feel more in control of your investment.

Buy low, sell high.  and learn to be patient. 




 I'm a Krugman fan generally (or rather I believe Keynesian economics, when dealing with centralized government), but disagree with him here completely.  

However, now after a few days of thinking about it, I wonder if this is a bit of a feign for him.  He hasn't really mounted anything of an intelligent teardown of Bitcoin, and now he's just pulling in other friends almost as if to shield himself.  If you think about where he is professionally, it makes a lot of sense that he can't really support Bitcoin or weigh in positively until it really becomes more accepted.  He's an economist, not an entrepreneur.

But then again, what he said about the internet... 




 I traded some ARIA last week.  Was going to try and ride it from 7 to 8 but volume really died off Thursdsay/Friday so I got out at +$0.18/share.

I'd watch it this next week...not sure what to expect with New Years but I'm guessing we'll have more tax sell off Mon-Tues.  Might want to wait til Thurs/Fri or week after to dive in.  Look for increased volume and whether it can break $7.40.

I still think this stock could get to $10 in the next 2 months.  It traded around $20 pre-FDA decision, and now with the amended guidelines I've heard their target market is half of what it was.  So $10 seems like something it could reach, but I've only been following it for a couple of weeks. 




 thanks man...just found out about /r/house this past month 





























 tried to watch it, but turned it off because Nancy Grace is more dangerous than any drug ever invented.  last thing I want to do is get hooked on that shit... 




 you definitely should!  there's a small group of us and we're always looking to network further and find new DJs.  I'm trying to put together a lineup right now for another house residency here in the city.  If anyone has good venue recommendations please let me know! 




 cute, and yet horrible. 




 there's a San Francisco DJ group meetup each month at Showdown at 6th and market.  Bunch of house DJs there...come check it out

 I just meant that both the run ups on TSLA and TWTR were fueled by bullish sentiment and shorts covering their positions.  TSLA more so than TWTR.  the short float (% of float sold short) for TWTR is now just 5%, TSLA's is 48%.  Short squeezes have seemed to factor a bunch lately in these mini-stock bubbles.  It's great if you can take the plunge early and get in, but you have to be quick on the trigger for exiting.  Getting in at the peak and having no safety net in the form of stop loss orders is a recipe for a personal shame spiral. 
























 just disassemble it, take the pcb out and wash it with clean water and dry it.  with no electrical current running throughout the board, you shouldn't have any issues if it's just in the water for an afternoon.  plus, the PS3 case will limit the water exposure anyway. 




 great article, thanks for posting.  
I own a pair of Gramercy raw denim that i've been very happy with:

My first pair of raw denim and they've only gotten better with each wear. 




 BBRY should be fun to trade tomorrow for a day trade, and through the week for swing trade.  




 You should have rushed to the other door and forced it shut, preventing her from entering.  At which point she would have felt frustration, followed by anger, and finally by affection.

 




 I'm fucking outraged -- she's only 38!?!  For sure I thought she was 50... 
























 Seriously, though, where's the photo evidence to prove this statement?!  'Cmon OP... 




 AAPL.  Next quarter earnings should be off the charts.  ApplePay, Watch, has been in beast mode and should continue for some time.   




 "I'm assuming it's off the coast of South Africa" 




 Love this KANT track.  MK does it up right.   




 How is this news?  This has been common knowledge since before I was born. 
























 That's really cool about baltimore, I forget that Animal Collective is from there as well.  
Any other new names to keep an eye out for? 




 oh cool, thanks!  checking them out...for some reason kinda reminds me of Washed Out though they don't really sound the same.  Maybe it's just that immersive wall of sound. 




 Samuel T. Herring's stage presence is captivating...not sure I've seen anything else like it recently.  Check out their 2014 performance on Austin City Limits:

 I was getting scintillating scotomas for a while over the past 5 years...shortly after moving to California from New England.  This is the first time I've found someone else who gets them.  Mine almost always would develop into a migraine, followed by nausea and then vomiting.   Super sucky.  However in the last year, I've greatly reduced their occurrence, mainly through stress reduction (they always coincided w stress and glare from sunlight).  Sorry for the overshare, just excited to meet someone else who has experienced this. 
























 Classic album.  Found this [weird video of Dead Finks Don't Talk, apparently set against a 60's-era GM advertisement film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7BDS19H9OM).  Oddly complimentary to each other... 









 love this track...Fear of Music might be my favorite Talking Heads album 




 Wut? This is awesome.  Dude is such a unique performer, will be interesting to see where he goes. 




 Just checked out Bromst.  Solid stuff.  I feel like I've heard of him over the years but never took the time to listen. 
























 ah yes, was hoping for something like this :) 









 What if a consumer wants to own two watches?  You know, because fashion... 




 Glad somebody else sees this.  Putting the computer on the wrist is analogous to what happened with watches over a century ago when they moved from the pocket to the wrist.  I can only imagine there were similar Luddites back then who complained along the same lines..."why do I need a clock on my wrist when I have it in my pocket?" 




 Kinda reminds me of the "Other Music" skit starting Aziz Ansari from a few years back, except that skit was actually funny
