 Manifesto!!! That place is awesome.  




 Kale. That stuff is gross.  









 Does anyone know how the Crumb sisters turned out?  




 Emptying the Recycle Bin on my computer.  





























 Whenever I am in a large crowd, I always think that it would be a perfect opportunity for someone to go through with a terrorist attack. Not sure if this counts as intrusive thoughts, hyper awareness, or paranoia.  



















 If you wanna be my lover, you gotta get with my friends.  




 Odd placement of the hand in the background of her left shoulder.  
























 Omitting accurate information in general 




 Unless someone's showing a project they're working on for class.  









 When you get home, all you will have to clean up is your suitcase. Dishes are done, floor is swept, and trash is taken out. This is the best Advice Mallard I've ever seen.  









 Found out I have depression after suffering from it for at least 10 years. Tried to tell my mom to watch out for my younger siblings, but she told me that I have nothing to be depressed about and I need to stop being so dramatic.  







































 This happens to me at Target.  




 Literally 




 I am embarrassed at how many of these "facts" i am learning are false for the first time because of this thread.  







































 Light grout is not a good idea. We have it in our house and cannot keep it clean. But looks great otherwise!!!!!  









 Must be digiorno.  














 OH MY GOD THATS RICHARD. I'm from Ames too!!!!!!! 
























 Communication studies. My university is considering a policy that mandates students cannot workouts than 20 hours on campus. 20 hours is one assistantship, which just isn't cutting it.  




 All great suggestions! I am a white female getting an MA in Communication Studies. My assistantship includes TAing and teaching one of my own classes. It feels like an impossible task to find scholarships for a non-minority, non-STEM graduate student.  




 My stipend covers rent and utilities. It would be helpful to have a little extra money for groceries and insurance. I really don't want to take out loans. Does anyone have tips for where to look for scholarships for additional living expenses? I got $500/semester grant from the government and that covers my mandatory fees. Thanks!!  




 Take some time to do something for yourself. It doesn't have to cost anything, or take a lot of time. Just try to appreciate making a decision to spend time doing something for yourself like taking a walk, listening to music, or reading a book. I've learned that the more I appreciate and respect myself, the better I am at communicating with others. Good luck! YOU come first.  




 I am on the opposite side of the issue. In fact, one of the worst things about depression for me is that I don't know how to ask my boyfriend or close friends to help. Last night, I called the suicide hotline. I am not suicidal, but I wanted to talk to someone about this extra burden I feel. I don't think I got any straight-forward answers, because I got the feeling that they are just there to listen and guide your thoughts while giving you a chance to talk. However, I don't think I was looking for straight-forward answers. I just needed someone to talk to that I didn't have a committed friendship or with. 

TLDR: Call the suicide hotline for depression counseling. They are also there to help people whose loved ones have depression.  




 Is there a reason why you HAVE to go? He should understand your anxiety. Is there anything you can ask him to do to make it easier on you? Are there things you can focus on enjoying like how well your boyfriend plays his instrument, or how you can reward yourself when you get home? Good luck!!  




 I don't know what your situation is, but I will offer advice with mine. I am in school, and have been seeing my doctor for 9 months. I know I can call and leave a message in the office for a renewal, but if I wanted a higher dosage, I feel like she should be willing to either prescribe it to me (upon hearing the patterns I experience) or recommend me to a doctor in my new area. 

If you call and ask, the worst thing that can happen is they say no. Which is hard when you have depression, but are also able to ask questions beyond those that warrant yes/no answers. 

Good luck. You owe this to yourself!!  
























 P.s. This is amazing!  




 That last stitch had to feel soooo good.  









 I was making pizza at home and realized I put the pepperonis below the cheese, but typically when you order takeout, they are on top. Is there a difference? I feel like this could be a top feed/bottom feed toilet paper sort of argument.  




 White female, communication studies. What I consider "average" when it comes to unique identifying factors for scholarships.  




 Communication studies. I want to be a professor. What kinds of companies offer scholarships? Do they typically come with a contract to work for them during/after your degree?  




 I am a TA for my assistantship and I am teaching my own section of a basic communication studies course for the upcoming year. It is fun I have learned
more than I ever thought possible, but it just doesn't quite pay the bills.  





























 I just tried to make this using the pattern. It said it made 6 legs, but it really only seemed to have room for 4. How did you alter the pattern for the legs? You did such a great job! 




 My boyfriends mortgage is in his name, so he pays the mortgage. I pay utilities, cable, internet, trash. We go every other on groceries and split vacations down the middle.  




 This happened to me once. I was working with a piece that started with 150 ch, so it was pretty big. I didn't want to tear my work out, so I ended up single crocheting down the side that had the dropped stitch(es) and back. It looked like a repair, but I was glad to have a fix that didn't require undoing 8 hours of work.  




 I'm assuming so. It's just a fabric glue, so in sure any brand would work. It is in a tube so it is easy to control how much you use.  




 I usually use a little Liquid Stitch on the knot. Creates a slightly tough area, but at least I feel like the knot will hold!  




 This is amazing! Did you make it up or use a pattern? 
























 Thanks! 




 Turned out much better than I expected. Learned a lot from watching my mom sew when I grew up.  




 Thanks! It's a really cute fabric!!  




 Thank you! I'm thinking I took "high waisted skirt" a little too literally, but it doesn't look proportionate if I were to fold over the waistband.  




 Good advice! It is a Singer 6412. Will have to look online for the manual so I don't miss any moving parts. How often should I oil it?  




 Thanks! I got it from hobby lobby. Was just thinking I should have written down the brand. Good luck with yours! Mine was fun. PLENTY of inconsistencies because I'm a beginner, but with the help of the video, it was pretty easy.
