 Sort of like explaining procreation to a 6 year old?  




 I had a toothache and with a little clove oil I got through it until I was seen by a dentist but I've stubbed my toe and tripped and fell directly on my knees and both times the pain was so great I THREW UP! Throw up pain is bad! 




 Here!, Here! Debating a Creationist about D's evolutionary theory and thinks that evolution says dogs can become chickens is like debating football vs soccer when said football fan thinks soccer can only be played with your ass. 




 Are you referring to the USA's general population or the rest of the educated population in the world? If you mean the USA then yes. 




 "Look at the Big Bang theory, please. Nothing exists, then everything does. Sounds like something that could be caused by an omnipotent deity if you ask me. Until that theory has been disproved, creationism hasn't either."

The problem with this logic is that the BBT and more importantly, Evolution can be disproved. That's what make it a scientific theory. This is referred to as the Popperian Princible. So far, Darwinian evolution hasn't been disproved and has, in fact, fit in quite nicely with other areas of scientific study such as geology, cosmology, and biology to name but a few.

Unlike Evolution, Creationism or ID can not be proved nor disproved because the supposed force(God) that created the universe operated supernaturally or outside the bounds of the physical world and since there is no way to test the "God did it" hypothesis it can not be regarded as a scientific theory.  

The question is not that creationism is false, maybe God really did plant fossilized dino feces to throw us off, it more that it's not science and shouldn't be taught as a competing scientific theory. 




 Just watched their parent's divorce? Were you the other woman? 




 I only got to the part where the dirt poor rural Kenyan got a text message. 




 I haven't seen this and I've been here for a year but maybe I only check it for an hour or two instead of surfing 12 hours+ till your eyeballs get tired. Sorry you're jealous but maybe timing is everything. Get a real life and good luck! 




 Christians were rarely subjected to or even sought out to be the victims of the Roman tortures of the Colosseums but the writers of Christian history want you to believe this because it makes good ticket. 

The Roman Empire, in expanding their empire, wanted to enjoin their conquered territories by allowing fully religious protocol of the future citizens to the citizen of Rome.  Bureaucracy being what is was and sadly what it is now, made citizens of conquered nations taxpayers but not enough to make a difference.

The book I was presented with as a kid that showed Christians being thrown to the so called "lion" was DISHONEST at the least and MISLEADING.  




 Sure, I'll validate that if you can give an explanation to my question. 




 I so wish that people would just say I don't know instead of giving it a spin! 




 Why in the heck would some sort of God that has existed forever, want or need anything!  Still foggy here. 




 The Bible starts with "In the beginning". I take that as only life on Earth and not time before. Most Christians would say their God has existed forever. If so, what were the motives during all this infinite time that would cause a perfect being to suddenly create anything? 




 I would venture to say that people that are impoverished and have no hope of any other kind of existence would welcome a religion that rewarded their suffering in this life for promises of eternal peace after death. 




 You make some pretty sound arguments for poverty before religion.  As a whole I would agree that Christianity in particular appeals to those that are poor. Several passages support the idea that rich folk can't go to heaven and the poor have a better chance of salvation.  Mother Theresa subscribed to this even though she, herself had the best healthcare money could buy.  

My view is that some religions make an individual"s circumstance concerning poverty or wealth an attribute or a hindrance. The Buddha came from wealth and gave everything away to understand why men suffer. But, unlike the Buddha who chose to teach how to achieve Nirvana in a lifetime, Christianity pushes believers toward death. That the only good thing to come out of a life of misery awaits after you're gone and some religions will say that if you tow the line, and accept your lot in life, your rewards in an afterlife are guaranteed. Sounds like a lot of bullcrap from ppl that are on top and want the majority of struggling ppl to stay complacent to me. 




 You bring up an interesting subject. Why were humans created with different sexual organs? If Adam just needed a friend then god could have just made another man. Since he didn't, was it his intention for Adam and Eve to have sex for pure pleasure since they would live forever? Maybe it was his back up plan just in case he had to punish them. If so, Eve still would have menstruated. Maybe he just added the whole reproduction thing like an after market add-on after the fall?  Either way, he could have designed the whole thing better so he owes me an apology in my opinion. 
BTW: guys don't have periods silly! 




 I was thinking the same thing! 




 You've made a pretty good correlation between religion and poverty. What is the point you're trying to make if any? Are you implying poverty causes ppl to be religious or that wealth makes ppl less likely to be religious?  To get to a conclusion you must present an explanation or a "why" to explain causation.  Correlation does not equal causation. 

Texas, for example has many wealthy ppl who are also very religious.
Hypothetically, you may have a town with a high number of churches and also a high number of alcoholics.  Are there lots of churches because there are lots of drunks or is it the other way around (most likely the case in my opinion)  and if it is the latter then why?
 




 You really ought to take care before you dismiss a viewpoint as ignorant. The Mongul Invasion didn't occur until the 13th century. The decline of Intellectualism began over 100 years earlier. To make this easier for you here is a link to that ignorant astrophysicist Neil Degrasse Tyson.

 If Islamic fundamentalism hadn't overshadowed the progressive thinking of that time, a great deal of Nobel winners would have been Muslim. 




 The cynical response of Burgess to a young political aspirant is indicative that the politicians understand the games that are played.  




 Most of the known stars were discovered and named by Islamic scholars and given Arabic names during the enlightened period of 800-1100 ad. Then fundamentalism sent in.......... 




 Not sure about the becoming part but I was born an atheist. lol 




 I'm not surprised. Saw all the movies as a kid but didn't read the book until I was an adult and understood the humanity of his creation and their downfall. As to your question, the answer is yes and he has "some splaining to do! 




 Yes, ask Frankenstein.

Mary Shelly addressed this very question and the horror of the conclusion she came to sums up the relationship of a creator vs the created and the responsibility one has to the other. The evil the story of Frankenstein presents is how a creator can create life and, because of the creator's and society's rejection and lack of guidance and compassion, the creation became a monster when he didn't start out that way. Science is not the culprit but only the vehicle that allows Frankenstein to realize his real mistake/sin in turning his back on his creation out of fear and self-preservation. In this story he ultimately died for it.



 




 Scripture records Jesus as saying he is the Son of Man. This floored me when I went to my first Catholic service but I dutifully looked it up.

The expression "the Son of man" occurs 81 times in the Greek text of the four Canonical gospels, and is used only in the sayings of Jesus. 




 This is off subject but I'm curious about your flair (Pedestrian). I was a practicing Buddhist when I asked my soon to be step-sons, 7   8, what their religious denomination was. They told me they were Pedestrians. Stifling a laugh I found out that their Mom was a Presbyterian.   




 Philosophically, if there is no beginning and no end then there can never be a "now" because it would take an eternity to depart or arrive at any single point. The symbol of a snake eating itself is illustrative of this concept of an impossibility albeit a primitive one. I believe that time as a force or natural law is real. The problem seems to be how time can exist within the concept of eternity. 




 If there was no beginning and no end then.....how would there ever be a middle?  You would spend eternity catching up to or looking back at some point in time. If eternity exists then time itself is meaningless. 




 Think about it. It just is. 




 If you were given a book that had no beginning nor end and asked to stop somewhere in between you wouldn't be able to. 

The Christian god is given many attributes such as supernatural, eternal, omniscient, omnipotent and omni benevolent. All of these definitions fall short and so the definition of the Christian God can not be defined. If your God can't be defined then all reference can't be used. 




 Regardless of whether one demerit eventually did or did not affect your weekend pass the fact that you received any kind of negative actions based on your religious views is unacceptable. 

I hope that when you are in the "fleet" you stand fast to your moral code and, as an officer, support those that want to be true to their own and not have to slide by.  




 Is there a subreddit for the KKK? 




 I'm guessing you affirmed and dropped the last part and only had to do this once. What kind of demerits did they give you if any?  




 A client on my Meals on Wheels route turned 90. She told me last week her birthday was coming up and her family, which doesn't visit often except for her daughter, was going to celebrate it with cake even though she has told them she can't stand regular cake. So my husband and I brought her a slice of Oreo cheesecake and 2 chocolate covered strawberries on our next visit. She was so happy she gave both of us a big hug. I think she was happy, not for the cheesecake or the gesture, but that someone really listened to her. 




 cafe'=coffee, "like the drink only spelled different" 




 Have you ever done that and made eye contact with someone else with their head up? My favorite is making eye contact with someone who is devout but peeks around to see whose head is not bowed. I refer to them as the prayer police and I always give them a wink and a smile. 




 From my first enlistment to my last(4th), I affirmed and dropped the "so help me God". That said, it can be a situation where you "out" yourself to your shipmates and Command which, if your chain-of-command is hostile to atheism, can lead to some hassles. Fortunately, because of a split-tour and a decommissioning, my reenlistments were toward the end of my tours; not that I ever hid my religious views. I did however, always seek out someone that I trusted to be open-minded to reenlist me.  




 Maybe they lied too. Were there any consequences if you didn't say it? 




 Upvote above if you remember this song. 




 I depends on what branch of service you're in and when you came in. Things were a lot different for older veterans than younger ones. I'm glad you weren't forced to attend services vice clean the barracks. Sounds like some improvements have been made! 




 Belgium, Norway and the Netherlands all have Humanist Chaplains. There you go! 




 Just curious, what branch of service are you referring to. In the Navy, in all but the most extreme situations, no one had to get approval from anyone and the mental health counselor was under no obligation to report your issues to the CO/XO/CMC unless the situation warranted it. Further more, unless you told someone no one would even know.  




 Neil, do you think think this will make any difference in the minds of Americans. There have been so many good writers from Carl Sagan to Steven Gould but, to me, it doesn't seem to have made one iota as far as changing people's minds. 




 I give you this, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8M74ufF4Q. 




 You said, " I've never felt so powerless or ashamed of something going on in front of me but it helped solidly build within me the sense that you always stand up for those who cannot stand up for themselves.

Read my post here. I felt the same way and I felt more shame because I was an adult in the military, knew right from wrong but because I was trying to hide a mental health issue I couldn't do anything. That's my albatross and I can't change it.  




 The last time I went to church I was in the Navy and went because I lost a bet with a Catholic friend. The bet had nothing to do with religion. The base Chaplain and I were friends and he knew I was an atheist. I pulled the Chaplain aside before service began and asked what I should do during the Eucharist. Before he answered me he asked why I was there. When I told him I had lost a bet he gave me a big grin and looked over at my friend, gave him a wink and told me to just cross my arms over my chest. He was the best Chaplain I've ever served with in my entire Navy career.  

PS: I'd never been to a Catholic mass before and I was surprised that they refer to Jesus as the "Son of Man" and not the "Son of God".   




 Did she live in Texas? 




 Definitely real. I can see the dudes left foot sticking out.  




 It's got a lot of wood though. 




 I learned later in life she had a weight problem as a teenager. My Godfather wasn't with us which was also unusual. I suspect they were having marital problems and my off-hand comment fed into her fear and insecurities so she took it out on six year old me. 




 Dumb. 




 I visited the Assembly of God, otherwise known as Holy-Rollers, when I was 12. I grew up Episcopalian so the speaking in tongues and flailing around on the floor was a shock to say the least. 

To call a family out like that on Easter seems almost medieval if not mean spirited!

 




 I was six when my parents divorced. I was sent to live with my Godparents who were also family. One night my Godmother took me and her kids to a pizza place for dinner which was a little unusual. After finishing my first slice of pizza I remarked to my cousin that my Godmother had already eaten three slices. I don't remember why I said this, maybe I just was commenting on how hungry she was or something but the next thing I knew she told me to sit there and eat the rest of all the pizza left, more than half of 2 large pies and took her kids and left to stay in the car. Not knowing why she was angry I started to stuff my face with pizza. After a while I realized I couldn't eat it all and I broke down crying. She sent my cousins back in to hurry me up but they could see I was upset and couldn't finish so they went back out to her car, told her I couldn't finish and then she came back in and boxed up all the pizza left over. We went home and she told me to sit at the dining room table and finish all the pizza. At this point I was scared and sick and didn't know what to do. I refused to eat anymore so she spanked(beat) me with a oak paddle in the shape of a hand that was 1/2" thick and then sent me to bed which I shared with my cousin who berated me for causing problems.  

Sort of tearing up just remembering this. I told my Mom many years afterwards and she could never eat pizza again. I've never told anyone else but it feels good to tell it here. ;) 




 Wow! On Easter Sunday no less. Do you remember what denomination it was?  Were you parents there? 




 I bet that guy still tells that story and laughs about it! 




 How is this public humiliation? 




 In the Navy they teach leaders to praise in public and punish in private. Even Non-judicial Punishments are conducted in private except on very rare occasions. Not all "leaders" understand this concept. On my ship (DDG), the Leading Petty Officer, Leading Chief and Department Head Officer all stood by the motto of "Motivation by Humiliation".

During a 4-day underway a young Seaman Recruit was found out to be wearing bicycle shorts for underwear and he had only brought one pair. Not satisfied with a private verbal counseling and a written warning our pipsqueak of an LPO decided he had the authority to conduct a "mini-NJP" in front of everyone in his workcenter which also included females.

He had the SR put on his Dress Blues and deliver a speech about hygiene and the proper underwear that can be worn. The LPO instructed everyone beforehand to ask many questions in order to mock and humiliate him. The SR barely managed to make it through the ordeal without breaking down mainly because he knew some of us were disgusted with the LPO's gleeful delight in bullying and stomping on the dignity of someone he cared less about. His favorite thing to smugly hum was "Another One Bites the Dust".  




 How many redditors have "In the Navy" playing in your head right now? 




 We have that in the USA too. Taste like a mustard chip. Not bad if you like mustard. 




 true religion=$$$$$$$ 




 Jesus loves me this I know
For the the Bible tells me so.
Little ones to Him belong
They are weak but he is strong.

Yes, Jesus loves me, yes Jesus loves me,
Yes Jesus loves me, the Bible tells me so.

This made me question God when I was 6 and still brings chills up my spine whenever I here it!
 




 When I went through boot-camp I was a practicing Atheistic Buddhist.  I was fortunate that a HM1 was allowed to hold "services" for me and a few other curious individuals. I was also allowed to use candles and incense in the barracks at my first duty station. The biggest problem on my first ship was my snoring! I was in the middle rack and got kicked, accidentally stepped on before I was diagnosed with sleep apnea. 

I'm curious as to what ridicule and discrimination you experienced.  




 We have an enlisted rate in the Navy. It's called RP or Religious Personnelman. Your job is to know all the different requirements of most religions and assist the Chaplain. If your unit has no Chaplain, you're it, so to speak. You can be of any religious bent or none. 

I knew an atheist Navy enlisted member whose rate was stagnant and couldn't be promoted. He decided to cross-rate to an RP because of the advancement opportunity and he was open-minded to members of all religious views or none and he eventually attained the rank of Chief. He neither judged or restricted any sailors requests nor their immediate family, and this is important, because often the family is as isolated as the service-member.     




 Funny thing for me was I looked 17/18 when I was 13. Now I just look 48, LOL.  




 First, are you married? This is important to determine how you should act. 




 I had this happen to me right after I joined the military at age 28. I looked 18 or 19 and was a low ranking enlisted sailor (seaman apprentice). A chief at my first duty station asked me some asinine questions and then made some condescending comments. When she noticed the horrified look on my face she asked how old I was and after I told her she profusely apologized.  I told her, with all due respect, that she should treat all her junior sailors as adults. 




 Well shut my mouth and keep on talkin' 




 Many atheist have posed questions to this subreddit in a very civil manner as I have. The problem is some Christians will always consider it impolite for someone to ask them to physically or intellectually defend what they believe. As a Christian, you come here already in a defensive position as you should. The fact there are a lot of atheist is not surprising since it's a debate of Christianity and anyone who challenges it.

BTW; Atheist don't just reject Christianity. It's only one among many.  Don't give yourself so much credit. 




 The problem is not so much with the Chaplain Corp. The problem comes when you have a CO or XO that are so myopically religious that they either condone abuses by the base Chaplain or use their position to punish service-members according their personally held convictions. I know this first-hand.     




 Sound about how the majority of hardworking "undocumented immigrants" from Mexico are treated in the US. They must be negatively stereotyped in order to justify profiting from the poor wages paid to them.   




 Expect Moose soon. You have been warned. 




 So you're saying you don't believe in any evil spirits, demons, satan etc.? 




 I've heard this explanation of evil as an absence of good. His supposed words were that he makes peace and creates evil. 

 




 In 1982/83, the uber-cool rich kids passed around a list of people that they thought might either want something (like an abortion/suicide) or whom they thought what might have happened to them in the past. I made it to the top ten. In a school that had a graduating class of over 2,500 it floored me that they even knew who I was, especially since I was in a work-study program and left at 1200 everyday for a part-time job. My parents moved 80 miles away and I wanted to finish school there.  

So "they", the honored and privileged students of Plano Senior High School decided that I was raped/molested by my own father and felt it necessary to divulge this "fact" to every other student at the school presumably, in an effort to help me according to their own Christian hypocrisy. This was false and my father passed away on the 8th of Dec, 1985 and none of the author's was there by my side.

2013, these same smug ares's sent me an invitation to a 30 year reunion provided I spend lots of money.

Although I would have loved to go and seen how the homecoming queen and king fared, I'm secure and happy that I've proudly served in the US military, am happily married and living in a beautiful house in Fort Worth, far, far away from Plano, Texas!  

 

 




 For some reason I picture you as Percy in the movie "The Green Mile" telling Delacroix that the mouse circus doesn't exist right before he's executed.

As an atheist myself, I find this immoral and exceedingly repugnant. Frankly it is not your place or self-deluded duty to "help" them however you seem fit. Has anyone asked you for religious CPR?

I sincerely hope you don't work in any capacity with elderly or dying patients. What you are suggesting is as unethical as a well-meaning Christian telling a dying atheist they will burn in hell forever. 




 I refer to Gen 6:6,7 and Gen 8:21,22.  




 Good question! He seems to have changed his mind or at least admitted a mistake on occasion. If not, I'd say no because he's perfect, but according to Himself, He makes mistakes, so yes and no. Hope that clarifies things! 




 With the model that Christianity presents I would have to agree with you up to a point. He could have made robots out of the angels and humans but he didn't because he needed their choice to praise him and rejoice in his presence. 

Sounds like a lot of parents that want their kids to love and respect them and follow what they believe, religious and atheists alike. Doesn't always work out that way but all but the most rigid, fundamentalist parents will make their children suffer because they exercise free will. God included but He makes it forever.

God is described as omniscient, omnipotent, and omni-benevolent, a supernatural being that has existed forever and will exist forever. Sure beats my parents description. Why then does he/it require anything, especially something as mundane as worship, appreciation or sacrifice? 
 




 You're proposing that evil is not a noun but an adjective used in reference to a sin(noun) as opposed to evil being a thing itself. This indicates that evil doesn't exist in and of itself and God didn't create it despite what Isaiah says.    




 Is there no free will in heaven? Sorry, that's a question for another time. If I understand you correctly, evil is necessary for free will. Free will is necessary for salvation. So, it follows that salvation in this world is dependent upon the existence of good and evil as both are necessary for free will. "Ultimately good" was a poor choice of expression. I meant that both equally are required. Since God created both equally then does evil supply a purpose in this world? 




 Sort of. The implication is evil is necessary for good. Which follows that evil is ultimately good. 




 Nope, try ringing the bell without stomping on the floor! 




 Wish I new what the script says. Any Early English translators on reddit? 




 Obviously Leo had the money for grave diggers or freshly executed "criminals"! 




 Suicide by peat-bog. At least it's unique! Well except for that one guy that was tied up but suicide wasn't ruled out and he was preserved for over a thousand years. Talk about leaving your body to science!  




 According to Isaiah 45:7, God created everything including evil. If not directly, he, at least, created the opportunity for original sin to be committed.  




 I've never met a fox in a foxhole that had any opinion on the matter and I been serving for 18 years. 




 You obviously never served in the military but no matter. Service-members do not have to follow unlawful orders and, in fact, are required to report any incidence of violations of the UCMJ whether or not they were involved. Furthermore, if they participate in an unlawful order, they can be prosecuted under the UCMJ and civilian authorities. That's right! double jeopardy. Also, many, many decisions are made by junior personnel on their own, so far from being the drones you speak of, the military requires that they possess reasoning skills instead of the "paint it or salute it" response you believe the military wants.   




 You had me until the Muslim professor smirked quite jewishly. Is jewishly even a word? LOL 




 From what I'm seeing, did the guy get pulled over by the police? Also, does everyone in Europe have dashcams? 




 Great question! Most people think that a species is defined by its inability to interbreed. Close but not quite. Loosely, a species can interbreed and produce fertile offspring. In the case of closely related species or subspecies they can interbreed but the offspring are generally, but not always, infertile and are referred to as a F1 hybrid. Peppermint is the plant equivalent to a mule, zorses, and ligers. 

Biology is a hell of a study!   




 My grandmother's home had three people die there. Her husband from a heart attack, her son from complications of cirrhosis and her grandson, my brother, from a heroin overdose.   














 I have a Sony VAIO K series laptop that is running XP using linksys wifi router with an external linksys receiver.  My son cleaned up my hard-drives and installed Avira as virus protection but now my computer slows down and locks up on certain times. It seems to be in conjunction with Avira downloading files up to twice a day. 

Is Avira something that is causing the problem and/or are there better protections I can use. He volunteered this as a free but I don't mind paying for something better.     




 Whenever I highlight something to print as a selection on my HP Deskjet it prints it out as "run-on" linear text instead of a screenshot type format. Any suggestions please??? 














 Mine are my brother(45) and uncle(59) that haven't worked for over a decade except sporadically and are both felons. They lived with my mother until she died Dec 11 and because of her reverse mortgage have been able to con them into staying there over a year.  The property has now been sold and they're just squatting waiting for eviction.  All this while I was in the military and sending money home to help "mom".  Received 90% disability and husband and I bought our first home.  Now, in not so disguised pleas have asked to come live with us.  Hell no!!  I still feel bad for them though. What do you guys think?    














 A local church has bought up property, 50+ homes that paid property taxes (5,000 a year avg each), in an old established neighborhood, to build a mega-church which pays zero taxes, with 5,000+ members.  Parking is at a premium so they want to nudge more "neighbors" to sell their homes to build more parking thereby lowering property values even more.  I don't mind a M-C building on undeveloped land but to reformat a neighborhood and essentially force people to sell who have lived there 30+ years doesn't seem Christlike nor neighborly.  
  My suggestion would be to eliminate the tax exception for M-C's like this because they use the existing infrastructure (roads and road improvements) and all other forms of taxpayer subsidized things like police and fire protection, public schools, libraries, weather alert systems, snow and ice removal, street lighting, storm drains, and even animal nuisance for free. These M-C's bring in a lot of money.
     They act in effect like a corporation with no rules. I think they need rules. I think the time has come to take a hard look at churches that are *wink wink* "non profit" and tax them! Reddit help!!!     


































 My uncle (57) and my younger brother (46) are soon to be homeless. They're both felons and haven't held a real job for the past decade. In addition they both have heavy drug use in their past. My uncle shows signs of his meth use even though he no longer uses. My brother has stolen from me and has never even filed a tax return. They've both lived with my grandmother and/or my mom from 2000 till they both passed. She had a reverse mortgage and they've been able to stay in the house for almost a year without paying a cent except utilities, ins. and taxes which are now due.

I was in the military until 2010 and for the past ten years sent money and gifts home to help Mom.

  I bought my first home after being rated 90% disabled. My husband and I are happy except that these "freeloaders" want us to subsidize them because "they're family".

  I won't jeopardize my own family, mental health or happiness to anyone that won't help themselves and they've had a year to figure out what to to but haven't. In one month they'll be on the street at Christmas time, no less. This depresses me to know end. The only thing I'm trying to help me out of this funk is Meals on Wheels. Wish me luck!

If anyone out there has had similar experience please share. I can't imagine it's not uncommon.
 





























 Really?, I guess the morals of the whole Bible were cherry-picked to death by the founders of the US or at least the Republican party? 

You make the declaration that your Christian god has given us absolute moral laws to abide by given your view. You say that this is a nation of freedom of religion as long as all other religions acknowledge that your religion is dominate and others must just suck it up.  

As far as I can read, the bible and it's new and old parts are as immoral as any book comes.  If you want to ban an obscene book from the public or school libraries it would be this book although I would never do that because I don't believe in banning books.  

I'd like to remind you that other religions say their morals are as right as yours.  You've decided to put your faith in a Christian god.  Good luck with that! 




 Have you ever considered that the image that God created mankind is not a physical mirror image but a potential mirror image of His intent and His compassion reflected in your soul/spirit?   




 Maybe "God' intentionally made the possibility of what "we" would call an aberration of nature for a purpose. Maybe he had a purpose for these people? 

I'm not one to delve into knowing the mind of such a God but it seems to me that if there is a god, all his creations were meant for some purpose even if they don't fit into our limited and contrived boxes and as such maybe, just maybe, this god is testing your compassion and what this god gave people as far as intellect.  

I kinda remember a sermon were Jesus said something along the lines of "as you treat the least fortunate then my father shall treat you".

Jog my memory please!   




 You define these Christians as hypocritical.  I do not.  A thorough reading of the Bible states that true believers are compelled to spread the gospel of Christ and make unbelievers understand the consequences of the choice they are given.  If they then choose to not follow the rules and commandments of Christianity then they shall burn in hell if the Christians don't do it first.  They've just replaced the actual burning with yelling taunts and insults. Everyone likes 
some encouragement!

The tired argument that Fundamental Christians are tolerant is laughable.  They are as intolerant as the most Fundamentalist Muslim radicals. 

A true follower of Christianity understands this and I respect their devout faith. It certainly rings truer than the milk-toasty pick and choose bible verses that fits whatever society you're in now deems moral for the majority of Christians of late. Talk about hypocritical! 

I'm saying that the true Christians aren't hypocritical or self-apologizing for their persecution of non-Christians. They truly believe that conversion is a matter of everlasting life.  Where I would rein them in is when it comes to mine or my children's rights to a neutral place to work or go to school. 




 Okay, I'm getting the picture now.  I've had to pay the property tax on my mothers house too.  I wouldn't include that in my own tax bill though.  You and your sister and mother have moved back on to help offset his tax burden and their housing situation.  That is your (PA=you'ins) choice but you didn't have to.  So don't include this in you recap of taxes you have to pay.  The $1600+ would be the same as if you were buying food, repairs to the home, insurance or paid for a replacement AC.  

What I'm saying is you misrepresented yourself in your original argument with ACA concerning your tax liabilities.   




 
"If in your world "Christians" are bullying non Christian people, then they aren't Christians at all."

In the real world, real Christians from many denominations have not only bullied but persecuted and many times murdered non-Christians or Christians from other sects all over the world.  Your No True Scotsman argument is quite false.

As far as your question about my own experience I would like to point out that I never said I was persecuted.  I said members of my family were bullied in school by Christians.  One example I can give you among many was the bullying my niece received at her school from her classmates when she "revealed" that her grandparents were Buddhist.  One would have thought by the reactions she received that she had said her grandparents were Satanist that practiced ritual baby killings.  The mean comments and ostracizing she got from the other kids were vicious and unrelenting even though she, herself was Christan  She would come home and cry uncontrollably because she couldn't defend herself or her grandparents at her age and none of her teachers ever tried stop the bullying.  This is the reason that these clubs, even in elementary schools are needed.  

It's not an agenda supposedly pushing atheism or even homosexuality.  It's about giving children of different backgrounds, different faiths or lack of, and sexual orientation a safe place to express themselves, vent, and connect with others of like mind.  The sad thing is many schools willfully oppose and actively try to prevent these non-traditional clubs from forming.  
 




 I'm going to assume that the 30.57% for property tax is based on the % of the total taxes you pay which you state is $16,000.  That would mean your property tax is around $4800.  

I pay about $1800 a year in property tax on a house appraised at $100,000. Assuming rates in PA are the same, you are living in a home valued at around $250,000 on a income of $25,000?  

I can see where you might appreciate the help of your relatives.  With such a limited income you couldn't afford a mortgage, insurance, and taxes.  Did you inherit this property?   




 Your total tax rate is 64% (or higher because standard deductions weren't included) in your earnings bracket? Where the heck do you live that state or city taxes are that high? 




 How are they using bulling as a weapon?  A weapon against what? The fact that Christians in the the USA have dominated and bullied other members of other religions for centuries and are now crying discrimination because they can't bully and discriminate? You should apologize! The only agenda I see from atheists is full inclusion into society and the protection of their children from hateful comments like, "you and your whole family is going to burn in Hell" from a 8 year old classmate.  

Whether or not you are aware of Christian religious bulling in schools it in fact happens and my family has has been in its cross-hairs.  If you think that atheist are only the bully maybe you're confused with the rights that adult atheists have tried to stand up for but, as far as the school yard persecution, that is alive and well and these clubs may help to keep these groups (non-christians and atheists) safe and maybe even excepted despite the bigotry and myopic views that are handed down to the unfortunate children of ignorant parents.  




 In a convenience store in New Orleans in front of the clerk an old black man asked me if I wanted to be a virgin again and said he could do it.  I was a 34 yr old white woman holding my 4 yr old son's hand.    




 Are you writing a dissertation or something? To your questions, he doesn't subscribe to any hard religions and is keeping his mind open but doesn't identify with Satanism anymore.  I think your comment was valid.  The point I was trying to make is that non-religious parents sometimes make the same mistakes as religious ones....in that your children aren't really your own. That you may wish for a  cookie-cutter imprint on them, don't expect it because they are separate human beings with a mind of their own.  




 Funny but I did research Satanism at the time and came up with more or less the same conclusion although I refrained from quizzes. 

He's 18 now and has a completely different perspective.  He does play the bass and after a brief love affair with Pantera has embraced Jazz and Blues.  His IQ is around 160 and will be entering the Navy's nuke program soon unless I can talk him out of being a MU!

To all the freethinker parents out there beware and yes, it's a good idea to teach your child basic religious instruction. 




 I'm shaking my head in disbelief that you've equated physical strength to intellectual and emotional strength. Women are for the most part, physically weaker then men. So what. The largest mammal on the earth is a female. Do you really equate that to some elementary school yard argument that men are, as a gender, smarter then women and thus supports the bibles' arguments of gender inequality when it comes to matters of social involvement in religion and politics? 




 Being an atheist I thought very hard about my influence on my child.  I wanted him to be a freethinker and hoped he would come close to the same conclusions I've come to so I tried to teach him critical thinking skills assuming he would reach the "right" conclusion.  Was I ever thrown for a loop when he announced he was a Satanist on his Facebook page when he was 15!  




 Well if we are to dive into the reasons gay marriage should be illegal under the Christian Flag then we should also consider the circumstances that would allow marriages to be legal under the same flag.  

First, polygamy.  Many of the Old Testament Prophets and Patriarchs had multiple wives, including Lamech, Abraham, Jacob, Esau, Gideon, Saul, David, Solomon, Rehoboam, Elkanah, Ashur, Abijah and Jehoiada. Some interpretations also suggest Moses had a second wife in Tharbis. Other polygamists identified in the Bible include Ahab, Ahasuerus, Ashur, Belshazzar, Benhadad, Caleb, Eliphaz, Ezra, Jehoiachin, Jehoram, Jerahmeel, Joash, Machir, Manasseh, Mered, Nahor, Simeon, and Zedekiah.

Second, the age of the bride was usually customary to be 12 years or even younger. 

Third, that rape victims were required to marry their rapist since their value as property was diminished. Deuteronomy 22:28-29.

Forth, slaves or prisoners of war were forced in marriage. Numbers 31:7-18 and Judges 21: 10-24.

Want to base US laws on what your myopic view of Christianity deems fitting as marriage then go right ahead and see how your Christian flag gets saluted!  




 Indulge me to allow the rephrasing of your statement:

 "The argument is that men and women differ and are not the same. You guys like to foment the idea that that is not true - that men and women are the same, have same capabilities, same responses, same reactions, and you are simply incorrect."

The argument is that blacks and whites differ and are not the same. You guys like to (sic)foment the idea that that is not true - that blacks and whites are the same, have same capabilities, same responses, same reactions, and you are simply incorrect.

Sounds a lot like an argument for the Jim Crow, separate but equal laws doesn't it?
 
Racism and sexism are both based on fear and the idea of superiority, dominance and submission.  The fact is the bible, from the beginning to the end, stresses the superiority of men over women. Whether one can prove Paul promoted this or not is irrelevant since the rest of the "good book" is quite clear.  




 You made the statement that men and women differ in some sort of mental capacity that affects their abilities to respond or react which somehow prevents a woman from being equal to a man. I asked you for examples and instead you asked me for examples from my experience in the military which I will provide after you defend your original statement.     




 rape seed oil = canola oil.  




 I'd like you to show some examples where women and men have different capabilities, responses or reactions that aren't culturally ingrained.  

As a former military member I've seen the gamut and find that men are no more different in their intellectual makeup then women especially under stress.    




 B. This one always got me.  Eve was deceived by a smooth talking serpent that claimed to know the mind of God and what would happen to them.  Since Eve didn't know right from wrong how could she make an ethical decision based on her experience. (If you've ever had young children you will know that telling them not to do something doesn't mean they understand that it's wrong or evil). Adam is influenced by Eve, who is, for all intent and purposes is a lessor creature and as naive as he is but he succumbs to, not a sly talking serpent, but a mere woman. Does he get the brunt of God's wrath for being gullible? No! Eve does! She has to bear children in pain for her "crime" alone. They both have to leave Eden but Adam had no specific punishment for his "crime".

Sorry, but just typing this out makes the story even more ridiculous!  




 From my experience and that of my mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, great great grandmother etc., we all agree that all men and women came from a women body following the conception required from both sexes.  

The fact that the bible considers women an afterthought and not made in the same image or glory of god is the reason that half of the human population has been treated like sub-humans without the basic freedoms of thought, speech, movement or self-determination that the average man enjoys.  Paul clearly defines a woman's role as existing for the benefit of men. To me, it's not much different then Playboy's exploitation of women.   




 As to your original question.....YES! 




 My ex was a framer/carpenter and grew a beard every winter.  I went through this same thing every spring when he shaved it off although it was kinda like makin' out with a different guy for awhile! 




 First person to mention emotional pain. That kind of pain can last a long time and no medicine can really help.  I'd give you gold if I had it.  Sorry for your loss. 




 Diverticulitis!  Occurs when small indigestible things like seeds, corn or bits of nuts get stuck in small pockets that have formed in the lower intestine and then become infected.  When the first bout occurred they gave me 1.0 gram of dilaudid which is 8x stronger than morphine and that wasn't even close enough to allow me to stand up straight!  The worst part is that I'm a chef and can no longer eat anything that has those ingredients.   




 I think Annie Oakley said it best when she said men, that were a sure shot, were considered marksmen but when she did it, it was trick-shooting.  

In this day and age, the favorite double standard between male and female managers is that men have an opinion on how to get things done and women have an opinionated view that is female centered. Complete BS!  




 Good for you bitch! 




 As the overweight middle-aged woman that uses the scooters in the grocery store and gets the occasional funny looks from some people I don't even know, I say screw them.  This is what they don't know.  I'm a military veteran that is 90% disabled. I can walk short distances but prolonged standing or walking is excruciating. The steroids I'm given have significantly contributed to my size along with depression and PTSD. I resisted using a cart at shopping outings but my husband loves to shop and browse so I gave in.   

So to all the redditors out there that say I'm not a person, I'm gross, don't have any self-discipline, selfish because I took a cart from an old person, or whatever other vitriolic spew comes forth, I'll tell you to look in the mirror. How many of you have served your country and suffered from it?  To those that have served you know, but the majority of comments are from those that have no clue and to those I say you're welcome. Every time I get those looks or comments here I hold my head up high and wish everyone a peaceful good day! 

  




 The problem is that you're being intellectually dishonest with yourself and you aren't living in the reality that those "words" can motivate people to justify their position that they are entitled to withhold a persons right to full representation in government and in the free market. 

Here in Texas, I'm not allowed to hold a public office even though I'm a highly decorated and disabled veteran of the military.  Why?  Because I'm an atheist and I refuse to say that an ice cream cone on a hot summers day is my definition of a god.    




 The church I grew up and was confirmed in refused to let me get married there because I hadn't attended in 8 years. I was a minor and my mother moved to another side of our city. He was British so this didn't surprise me although I was disappointed with the congregation's reaction. 




 Heh, my mom was talking about this and I can't help but chime in on the subject (I am her son).  Honestly, I really have no opinion on the subject, as I have never had a partner say "Eeew, I don't like you being cut, so we just aren't going to have sex." or vice versa.  I am not any happier or in any way saddened by being cut.  Hey, at the very bottom line, I'm a little grateful for being able to be lazy with hygiene (although I'm not) and get away with it.  Also: As I know no different, I can't say for sure that I'm as sexually "effective" as I would otherwise be, but I'm not impotent, and that's the (relatively, because I don't plan on having any kids any time soon) important part.

Oh, and I know a few people that are Jewish, and it's more about honoring Abraham than appeasing any kind of god. 




 Your putting up a paper tiger.  

Explain to me why I, as a disabled military veteran with an approved dog can be refused service from a taxi driver because his religious beliefs think that dogs are unclean or my religious beliefs won't let you carry a bottle of wine in my luggage.  What if, as a taxi business, I wouldn't pick you up and drop you off at your home because my religious beliefs dictated that as a woman you have no rights?   




 Are you a parent?  




 I covered the ability to provide part.  My analysis is not "silly". If you're too lazy to research the topic then try this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGx4IlppSgU Although not comprehensive into full series of the Mask of Men it's a starting point!  




 I'm not ashamed but I do regret my part in the decision. His father had a say in the matter too.  However, your anger at me is misdirected.  Our society puts a lot of pressure to conform and while my decision was partially based on this I do not think he is deformed or had his sexuality affected in any way.
  
With that being said, I'm sure your own mother and father would like to circumcise whatever organ that causes the vitriolic bile that spews from your mouth and replace it with a civilized prosthetic.        




 No. There were studies then that indicated circumcision reduced the rate of cancer and other diseases but they were later  dismissed because the subjects studied were in third-world countries were sanitation/hygiene weren't considered a priority.      




 Hoping it's not a nail! 




 As an Atheist/Buddhist I had my son circumcised because of health reasons and concerns from his father as far as being different.  I've asked him as an adult and he has no problem with it.  As as women and have experienced both I'd say I prefer a circumcised penis. Sorry Foreskin!  




 Only the balls man, only the balls! Dicks don't cause pregnancy, nads do.  Keep the penis! 




 I think you hit the nail on the head!  




 Unlike girls, that naturally "become" women based on their first menses, some cultures feel the need to provide a time in which boys "become" men based also on their ability to procreate since there is no specific event for males.  Menstruation and childbirth=pain and blood so, in some cultures, not surprisingly, they require boys to demonstrate their ability to withstand pain and/or survive an injury involving blood, although this can also coincide with an ability to provide for his family.  The example above does both and also puts the burden of birth control on the male!  




 Again my friend, what are you referring to? 

You have the right to refuse service to anyone as long as it's not based on sex, religion, national origin, race or sexual orientation.  These categories are based on federal laws.  Do you feel you have the religious right to circumvent federal laws.....yes or no? 

 




 Not my first memory but when I was six I remember the phone rang one evening and my Mom answered. She then threw the receiver at my Dad saying it was his girlfriend. Two months later he was gone and my mother started working. We were babysat at home and on July 5 I fell and broke my arm looking for fireworks my gran had given us. I spent 2 days in the hospital then went to live with my cousins and never went back home. Fast-forward to 2009 and my gran died on July 4th.  You'd think Independence Day would be a sad time for me but it hasn't. 

I hope Christmas wasn't totally ruined for you. 




 "gay couple discriminating based on religion".....what are you talking about? 




 Did you type these estimates/statistics with a straight face? LOL 




 Reminds me of "The Incredible Mr Limpet"! 




 If you have a public business then yes, you have to give a valid reason to refuse service. 

It's not based on a sense of entitlement but a history of discrimination that did not allow blacks to use the same front door or stay at the same hotel where they entertaining whites ect.

If you are going to discriminate based on race, religion, sex, or disability then you have to state this and prove why. 




 Sorry Sid, at first I thought you meant that all gays were good at flower arrangements and decorating cakes. You still however, haven't answered the soundness of your proposed business plan.  




 Considering that HC covered 282 laws it would definably be impressive!

The problem with the Big 10 is that six of the "laws" directly conflict with the US Constitution. The remaining four are almost universal and do not need to be tied to a specific religion.    




 The largest Christian charity is Christian but not Catholic.

Real justice under your oldest, continuously operating institution in the world that condoned murder upon innocents and "heretics" in the past for over 400 years and in real time, (it's denial of their support the Catholic Church gave Hitler.) leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

Don't believe me LIU. 




 Well said. 




 Does a person starting a business that only targets 10% of the population across all socio-economic status that may or may not get married much less use a florist or baker sound like they have a good business plan? 

BTW, your narrow-minded stereotype of gays is almost laughable if it weren't out-dated.     




 It can if it will get all those Christians to stop insisting on the "big ten" being posted everywhere based on the US being a Christian Nation! 




 I should clarify that I'm looking for the reasons or arguments to justify any discrimination based on religious beliefs and how far should you be allowed to go and not solutions.  If you believe religious discrimination is okay then is it okay for you to be discriminated against based on another religion. The case of Muslim taxi drivers that won't allow service dogs or bottles of alcohol in in their cabs comes to mind.  




 "What church do you go to" 




 You don't have to blow up. Calmly tell them that you disagree and that while you understand and appreciate their concerns you must follow your own conscience. Maybe you can add that sometime in the future you may change your mind just to give them hope and shut them up. 

I understand how it hurts to think that family could think this way but you need to understand that they don't wish this upon you. They really believe this to be your fate and only want the best for you however misguided. Life is short. Live your life as true to yourself as you possibly can no matter is it upsets ANYONE. Live in reality always and never live a lie! 




 You, your parents and brother are all behaving hypocritically. Is your sister the source of tension? Why can't you all hold your own opinions?

 




 If you are an atheist or agnostic and have read the AA material that treats "patients" like some primitive sub-humans that will someday see the light then well, its no wonder its supposed miracle cure doesn't work. Just a little snake oil and a lot of jobs in the rehab business are on the hook if this lie is ever found out.
   




 I could be wrong now, but I don't think so!

At an AA meeting you are depending on others that are emotionally stunted due to their substance dependence to help you through your own problems. Sounds like a bad plan to me. 




 The expectation though is that you will eventually "mature" or grow to understand that your limited view of a higher power actually is the Christian god.  I guess that if believing a doorknob is your higher power and it helps to stop you from self destruction then go for it. 

For me and others like me, this is intellectually dishonest so the program could never provide any help. I never had any legal problems involving alcohol. I just knew I was drinking too much and needed help so I self referred to the Navy's rehab program.  What I didn't do was check my constitutional right to freedom of religion at the door in order to get medical care.    




 I find your attitude about 12-step programs refreshing.  So many of those that have been helped by AA/NA, which are few compared to the number of people that have tried it, become almost cultish about 12-steps being the only program that works.

I'm an atheistic Buddhist so AA's principles were in conflict with the Buddhist principle that the power to change comes from within yourself and, of course the fact that I hold no belief in Gods.

There are several organizations that you can recommend. I used Rational Recovery but there is also S.O.S., Secular Organization for Sobriety and Women for Sobriety.  

WFS is particularly helpful because the challenges female alcoholics face are usually different then mens and some AA/NA groups can be predatory toward women that are in a vulnerable state i.e., the 13th step.  

Again thanks for having the insight to realize AA is not a one fits all fix.
Best wishes to you!
 




 "I don't think the literature, or the opinion of many recovering addicts, agrees with your notion that AA "is clearly a religious program" and requires a belief in God."

Several federal court opinions have found that compulsory participation in AA/NA is unconstitutional because of its religious nature.  Have you read the condescending chapter in the Big Book addressed to the Agnostic? It clearly says that a higher power is a reference to God.
 




 The moral of the story is don't let anyone define you including yourself. 




 I agree that actually making love with a woman is preferable to watching and jacking off to a porn video. I like to watch porn and sometimes with my SO *BUT*......
The problem is most porn makes a caricature of what actual sex is like so that people, especially if they are young with no experience, think that this is the norm when it's not.  Young women don't feel they measure up to the women they see  in the videos. Young men often feel inadequate compared to the videos. When this is their bench mark, and you have to include the performances of their favorite entertainers, they have no REAL REFERENCE POINT to gauge their real  sexuality and how to express it.  This has led to to so much sexual dysfunction among Americans that is could be be referred to as an epidemic.

Pat's worse than a moron. He's a charlatan that has bilked millions to pay for his extreme wealthy lifestyle. He's smart and savvy. A moron doesn't know better but Pat is the poster child of why religious entities such as church's like his needs to be audited by the IRS.

He is nothing more than a snake-oil salesmen and HE KNOW THIS! Just can't wait for his except status is pulled.     




 You didn't listen to Pat, the pictures are the problem because we can never measure up. Maxim did teach me how to hypnotize a live lobster though the purpose of this knowledge was just to impress/seduce a woman.   




 Okay, I agree but only if you include men that read Maxim. It too offers the same idiotic advise to men as Cosmo gives to women only spelled different. 




 You obviously should be so proud of your Dad. 




 Urine is sterile by the way.  




 Can you explain? I thought any number multiplied by 0=0.  




 Pissing on yourself or your "friend" will stop the pain from some plants and insects such as bull nettles, mosquitoes, ant bites and some jellyfish stings. Ammonia works well too if ya don't have it in ya.  




 Nice try! 




 And was appealed and overturned. 




 Most menstruating women that have cramps don't go to sickcall unless it's severe or are bleeding heavily or for too long. Believe it or not, women know that Pamperin and Motrin can help and use those.  Most though, just get through it and get on with life. 

What exceptional story are you referring to? 




 What a beautiful calli! We have one that's a stray. She drinks from our Koi pond and catches the mice so we feed her dry food. She got flack from our two cats but doesn't anymore.  Try this; make sure Sasha is there before you feed her. Give Sasha a Tablespoon of what you're feeding the stray (even if it's the same thing you feed your cat everyday, Sasha will go for it for territorial reasons).  It's a distraction and it reinforces a positive element to the visits from the stray.  Worked for us, they now touch noses through the glass door to our sunroom.

As far as the hole......bad idea!  You're inviting squirrels, coons, skunks and possums to make their home there. 

Good luck and best wishes! 




 What happened? 




 Blame it on their period? JK I know guys get it too. 




 Chef here, most of us keep super glue in our knife bag for this exact purpose. Also, black pepper is great to stop bleeding on a small cut. 




 This may surprise you but no.  Some of the best sex talkers out there are guys! 




 I'm sorry for this but I just imagined Lil Jon saying "What!, what?. 

Any deaf people out the that want to enjoy phone sex? Maybe I'll make a million printing the "white" pages. 




 Keep trying.  Do you have assists other than the VA? You might try the DVR in your state 




 The military medical corps is advised to try to distinguish between real medical situations vs. those that are suspect. The end result is everyone is considered suspect until otherwise proven because of ppl trying to get out of duty, which, if you are in a medical emergency can be fatal in the wrong command and can't get proper medical evaluation.  




 Hope your Dad is Okay but still, NOT COOL! 




 I've heard if you crush up the tablets and heat them with ammonia it makes a very good mesquito remedy. 




 Sounds like my uncle.  He has prostrate problems that he take meds for fluid retention. He was hospitalized for it and has high blood pressure but he'll drink a 2 liter coke a day and even salts his pizza and smokes. He's homeless and I let him stay here briefly with me and my husband during which he pissed on our guest bed. I made him wear diapers the rest of the time but he became insulted and left. If he doesn't care, why should I? 




 Exactly  




 military? 




 You're so right. I've heard many stories of the Navy blowing off back pain, men and women but women have to go through the ol' is it your period or pregnant part first even if we're post menopausal and it's in our record lol. 
VA care isn't much better. 




 If you cut off a small piece called an "eye" that then can sprout it's possible but doubtful.  




 Really dude, What kind of outward sign do you need to have your arbitrary pain taken seriously?   After being given Motrin and sent back to the field when I couldn't stand up-right I ended up at the local civilian hospital and after they took the time to look for a cause, found I was suffering from diverticulitis (not rare) and given morphine for pain.

I hope you're not anywhere in the medical field especially the military. 




 Yeh well maybe she forgot or didn't know that a potato cause those symptoms.  




 Maybe. It's not legally considered part of the sex industry though child labor laws might come into play. I guess you wouldn't be able to call your service as Googoo, ooo, oooo, ooooo, Gaga, aa, aaa , aaaaa!   




 My family member hasn't faced murder charges but he told me he killed his best friends' wife because she took/sold all his pain medication until he died of cancer. I have no evidence he did this and someone else was with him. I only have his word.     




 Phone sex operator. It's legal, you can be any age or in any shape/disability and work your own hours. Put an ad in the paper. Great tax write-offs too! 




 "woman came in complaining of severe stomach pain. He was expecting to diagnose her with menstrual cramps or something else rudimentary and gave her basic pain meds etc"

This pisses me off. As a female with a 20 yr career in the Navy I can't count how many times some male corpsman blew off my symptoms this way.  If this story was true, which I doubt because a vine growing from a potato would not be able to grow outside the uterus/vagina and make its way to the spine, and she was in severe abdominal pain and the only thing he did was give her Motrin then send her on her way he would have been brought up on charges if it was found she was suffering from a real medical emergency condition. 

That said, I think your buddy was just drunkenly jerking your leg. Thanks for letting me vent though!  




 Barry, can you back any of your statements with facts?

Or are you just being ignorant and ranting because you're well, ignorant. 




 No, this is soo right! 




 Sorry bicyclists, but you get what you deserve. Saw this all the time in San Diego. Bike clubs would ride in formation and since there were so many of them they would block stop signs and force the whole group to go through, blocking regular traffic and pedestrian traffic. I guess the spandex and the fact that they are "what?" means they are above the rules.  




 Why do you think I should have reverence for a book that has negatively influenced the treatment of half of the human population simply because of the sex that they were born into. The bible, and specifically the Genesis story has condemned women into second-class status slightly higher than a child. Woman are held responsible for the downfall of all mankind and because of your "good" book women have paid tremendous injustices over the centuries for just being born female.  

 The story of A   E is a myth that has been used to subjugate women  by blame and slander. As for the morality of 1,000 years ago when slavery and entire nations drew their moral code from the bible, I just wonder what kind of planet you think live on ???  




 Let their dog shit all over the complex but especially the area around the mail boxes and not pick it up so we have to smell it when picking up our mail.  




 You're not too well acquainted with the correctional/justice system. As a law student you should be. Jails don't correct anyone. If anything they create criminals.  

My question was how is the law practically applied? Does society only arrest those that say, threaten to jump off a bridge and in doing so tie up traffic? 




 Haven't heard this in years but it's appropriate, http://youtu.be/3Vl9Uz-rmIU 




 Pre-law student,  I was not arrested after my suicide attempt and, as far as I know, you can't charge someone who's dead with self murder, how is this law (if there is one) applied? 




 If you were a burned out ex-meth user, felon, and alcoholic homeless guy with permanent brain damage that has left you with mental health problems along with physical problems brought about by poor lifestyle choices, ie, diet, smoking, no exercise etc. which together makes you unable to hold down any kind of job and you have no friends or family that would be hurt if you died and you also decided to commit suicide in a manner that wouldn't affect any strangers, would it still be considered selfish? 




 So what? I don't care if Christianity, Judaism. or Islam has solid evidence of interpretation. Which they don't. What does solid evidence of interpretation mean?  
  If you mean that a religious myth has had a solid tradition of being handed down through generations of interpretations then..Big Deal! Ignorant parents raising ignorant kids. What is your point?
  The constitution of the US is infinitively greater than your holy book.
   




 Makes me wonder how they did that. As a parent you would think that it would be impossible not to develop emotional attachments. Did they just turn it on after the first birthday? 




 Pepper, never ever concede that which you have no proof of. Ever.

You are correct that Perry and his cronies' only objective is to change the foundation of our state government to be based on Christian Biblical rules and laws including the education of our children. I base this on his ties to the Dominionist's organizations he has supported and their specific legislation. I also agree that educator's within my state abuse and flaunt established laws and the state doesn't come down hard enough when violations are discovered. 
There are, however, a few diligent rational folks in Texas that have managed, to some degree, to keep them in check.

If you know of a school district that has allowed creationism to be taught as fact you need to let me know where or at least contact the TBE. 

BTW: Regarding concessions, I'm not a teacher but thanks anyway.  I'm only a disabled Navy(cook) Veteran that has had an interest in Paleontology for the last 30 years.  




 That's the mafia's take on it anyway. 




 Yes I do.

"In July 2011, the Texas Board of Education, which oversees the Texas Education Agency, did not approve anti-evolution instructional materials submitted by International Databases, LLC, while continuing to approve materials from mainstream publishers."

It might be helpful if you thoroughly read the entire contents of the links you provide.  That said, critical analysis of darwinian evolution could include the small debate between punctuated equilibrium vs uniform phyletic gradualism. The TEA does not require the teaching of creationism. Critical analysis is good to teach public school students. It also helps when reading articles on the internet.  




 Teaching creationism is not required in Texas. JS 




 Thank God it's working! 




 From the Bible, we find passages that won't even acknowledge a child until they are a month old. Maybe because of the death rate but at least one would simply acknowledge that they existed but they didn't.  
























 Anything that is inedible, is not really meant to be eaten or has no relation to the ingredients on the plate and which can be flicked off the plate with your thumb and finger.  Examples would be a tomato rose, a flower or a sprig of herb that is not used in the dish.
 




 .......and they probably speak English better than some here.  Hopefully they don't learn English from some of our videos that promote slang.  




 WUT?!!!   




 I've heard that there are more people in China that can speak and write English then in America. BTW, my mom couldn't understand Chinese but she recognized their language. 




 lol 




 This was my mom's experience not mine.  I'm sure she knew how to use it but knowing her quirks she was just interested in why the instructions were so long.  Maybe there was some ancient Chinese wisdom that said one should Never Ever use Tiger Balm on specific sore places! 




 Mom told it better than I can.  She had a great sense of humor.  




 I got the impression they knew exactly what they were doing and probably had a great laugh over it later!  




 How do you figure that?  As far as I know he never married, hung out with 12 other guys whom he encouraged to leave their families just for him and I don't recall him saying anything about gays explicitly.   




 My uncle is this sloth's long lost twin brother! 




 Thanks!  I'm assuming I should work bottom to top and use odd numbers. 




 Awesome!  I'm in culinary school and my instructors wont allow us to use garnishes that are "flickable" for plating such as a tomato rose however, I'm now planning to use the strawberry rose as anyone would eat that!  Any tips? 




 My mother and cousin were in CA on vacation.  Mom's back was sore/stiff from driving so she bought some Tiger Balm however, all the instructions were in Chinese which she didn't understand.  She spots this elderly Chinese couple and approaches them to ask if they could read to her what the instructions said.  The elderly woman takes the instructions, looks it over and smilingly broadly says yes.  She then starts to slowly explain in Chinese what the instruction says looking up occasionally to make sure they are listening or sometimes pointing out something on the instructions and nodding her head to make sure they understood. She and her husband did this with a serious, straight face the whole time. She hands the instructions back to my Mom.  My mother politely thanks her the she and her husband walk away without saying a word.       




 From someone really old (meaning before cellphones, digital cameras, the Internet and accompanying social media) we had to physically meetup with our friends.  That meant actually leaving our house!  Of course it also meant, for some activities you had to travel a significant distance. 

That leads me to the first thing to be cool.  A driver's license.  After that if you were really cool you may have had your own car!  Of course you couldn't show off said car without Facebook so you had to do the the next best thing which was the second coolest thing.

Cruising the lake, beach or local drag on Friday or Saturday was the standard.  Drive-ins were also acceptable but you couldn't blare your favorite cassette featuring AC/DC, Duran Duran, or Cars to name but a few. 

Cheap alcohol, pot and maybe microdot were acceptable but anything harder then that, then you were considered a freak or druggie to be avoided.  

I have to add this, getting knocked up or getting a girl pregnant was not seen as cool or some sort of achievement.    




 Your dad has some mad talent.  As someone who is familiar with koi, the markings aren't so great.  Pretty but not what koi dealers look for.  If he studied up the subject he may appeal to more koi enthusiasts. As for me, I'd love to buy a painting! 




 Now if only the average US female marine could do that! 




 and we pay no state income taxes with only a modest sales tax of 7.25%. 




 Winnsboro, Tx, just a tiny spot in the piney woods of east Texas 




 No 




 $235,000 or so 




 When I was a server, it was assumed I made 15% from the $'s that I sold and my earnings were reported as income to the IRS whether I received 15% or not.  What I didn't know then is that, as a hourly paid employee who is paid less than minimum wage as most of us are, if our tips don't combine to equal minimum wage then the employer must make up the difference.  

So lets say you're on the clock as a server and no one comes into the restaurant the entire time you've been hired to provide wait-staffing duties.  You are paid $2.86 per hour to be there and you stay there the entire time but never encounter a customer.  The restaurant has to pay minimum wage, $5.75 in some states to make up for their lack of customers while you're on the clock.  This is a little known secret that most places don't want servers to know about. 




 If it were some of the people I worked with, they would have ripped open the front of the Shiner case and taken out bottles from the middle hoping the ones on the outside plus the cardboard would be sufficient to hold up the rest the cases. 




 Worked in a plant nursery where people would bring in leaves and ask why they were turning brown.  "It's fall" 




 My brother gave me this album for X-Mass.  Always enjoyed it and have never came across anyone who knew who they were. Thanks. 




 Todd Rundgren,  "Hello it's me" was for the masses but the album, "A wizard, A Star" decidedly was not and I love it to this day! 




 This is why everyone should know how to tell how long ago a tire was manufactured.  Rubber degenerates. Many "new" tires sold are up to two years old if not older in some unscrupulous stores.   




 Tootie, I'm sure that your grandma can tell you about her discovery 




 and clitoral ripples! 




 As someone that worked at a high end hotel in a major metropolis in the US I can verify that Saudi guests are the most demanding (wanting lamb at 2 am) and the most obnoxious and sexist A-holes I've ever dealt with.  I guess they suffer from Affluenza too! 




 I've always thought that Jimmy Carter, while handed a s**t sandwich, handled the Iran situation well.  He had the stones to refuse to negotiate with terrorists unlike Reagan who traded arms for hostages.  He may not be the most celebrated president but he is undoubtedly the most post-executive selfless serving president of all.    




 I'm confused, I thought the holy trinity was onions, bell peppers, and celery. 




 No 




 I think you're confusing celebration with endorsement neither of which apply to US discrimination laws concerning business practices.  

If I provide a cake for a 10 year olds' birthday I'm neither celebrating nor endorsing the birthday.  I may sincerely believe that his age should include the 9 months of gestation before birth as some cultures do but that's not my place.  I sell cakes and because I choose to sell them to the public in the US I have to adhere to non-discriminationary laws.

Your examples of the photographer fail.  Unless you have the photographer give a thumbs-up in a photo or force a personal statement of endorsement of the marriage you don't have a claim of a  violation of your personal beliefs. Just photographing the event is not an endorsement.

As far as your silly comment about atheist, we absolutely don't borrow Christian morality as our world view.  We reject Christian morality with all its hypocrisy. To most atheist, Christian morality is an oxymoron. 

 The arrogant attitude that Christians hold themselves to concerning their monopoly on morality is laughable at best. 




 I'm not talking about individuals.  Many individuals from many religions are critical thinkers in their respective fields.  

I'm referring to a religions capacity from their own tenets to be able to allow or even encourage critical analysis of itself.  The only religion that comes to mind that even comes close to is certain sects of Buddhism. All the other major religions from history and my experience would be perfectly happy to not have their followers be exposed to other religions or people with no religion.  More than just a few bad apples.  Do you remember reading about the Inquisition?  Are you aware of the religious freedoms denied in other countries?   




 I'd probably guess the later however good luck to you both! 




 You need the disclaimer, "Don't try this at home" or you'll have guys showing up at the hospital with super glue shoved into their dicks.  




 YET! 




 My son's astrolabe. 




 Although they both seek answers to basic questions concerning life they are inherently different. Philosophy is always based on critical thinking and wisdom.  Religions are not and most are actively apposed to critical analysis. 




 I meant he was resurrected or raised from the state of death.  So therefore, while he may have physically died for a brief time he was brought back to life.   




 I'm not sure about the hell and back thing.  Where does it say that he went to hell after he "died"?  Either way, since he was resurrected and then ascended into heaven what, if anything was sacrificed and if so, by whom? 




 The problem I have with this is Jesus ultimately did not die so there was no sacrifice.   




 Most likely almond tuiles. 




 I  imagine that after the pearl broke the bottom part of the shell would hold the sauce for dipping. 




 The "pearl" is probably a chocolate sauce but it can be made with many types of liquid.  The technique is called spherification using molecular gastronomy.  Basically sodium alginate is mixed with the liquid, then dropped into a calcium chloride bath by the spoon full.  This causes a "membrane" to form which holds the chocolate in a sphere shape.
Cool huh?  




 It's not crazy at all and almost all European Christians understand this but unfortunately many American Christian theologians want the Bible to explain the history and origin of life and they will stop short of nothing to to advance their views regardless of all scientific evidence that shows the Bible is wrong on this subject

 




 Kangaroos were in the middle east?  Is there evidence of that? 




 Why are you Christian?, birth or choice? 




 Are you kidding me?  Seriously? 




 For the most part no.  




 Paul's teaching did not come first.  Jesus's teachings did and overrode many things anything Paul proposed later.  The break came because of the lineage of Jesus's bloodline vs the apostles and their authority over the early Christians.  It was basically a power-struggle.  No big whoop here but A big whoop then! 




 The common disputes are over land, wealth, and political control.  The use of religion as an excuse to justify horrific methods to obtain these ends is both ancient and contemporary and is always used to appeal to common people.  Rarely has a religion grown and thrived without the support of government.  This is why some American Christians are threated and lashing out against perceived prosecutions against them.  

Their dominance is quickly eroding and they know that the US Constitution does not support their former favored status.  Neither do our laws or legal agencies concerning discrimination.

  Demographics don't lie.  Religion in it's former state has a new wrapper and it's not supported by any political group as our founding fathers wanted it.  We are a diverse group.  If you want to belong here then you must give anyone from a religion different from yours complete rights to disagree but no right takes away what are basic human rights even if your religion disagrees.   




 "Have some respect for yourself and date your own species"

Where the fuck did you attend college where they taught that other races like blacks and asians were a separate species from whites?   




 That's the problem. They don't. 
 They only have some governmental pinheads in Saudi and some others in the Middle East that dictate what is and isn't acceptable.  They're are none more eligible to dictate what is right or wrong then my cat.
  Normal Muslims are mostly afraid of the bullies that have invaded the West but I'm not.  If you're listening you cowards and fools, I'm right here in Texas and can't wait.  Best wishes to my real Muslim friends!   




 Yea, I find it bizarre that all the animals got along in Eden but had to start killing and eating each other because of "the Fall of Man". 




 Congratulations, you have just summed up the Patriarchal view.  Until you grow old enough to worship Me and respect Me as your Father I have no use for you.

Matriarchal view.  I will love and protect you while you can't protect yourself.  As you grow I will try to guide you and when you are strong enough you will go out and live a good life. 
Hopefully you'll remember to call me every other weekend.   




 I also think I'm lucky to have been born as an intelligent animal in a country and at a time when expressing my opinions won't be a death sentence! 
 
I believe that the average human commits hundreds of acts of kindness toward fellow humans, animals, and sometimes even the environment everyday.  We do this even if its not convenient, necessary,  beneficial to us or in extreme cases may endanger ourselves.  I believe this is the natural human condition and those that prey on others are in the small minority but cause the vast majority of unnecessary pain and suffering by choosing greed, be it power, fame, control or security because they lack a fundamental connection with humanity.  Sad. 

  To me suffering is a part of life just like death and both are part of the natural world.  What is considered cruel in nature is only a human construct.  Only humans inflict cruelty on each other when they don't need to.  I "think" my cat is being cruel by "playing" with an insect or mouse before he kills it but is he?  Maybe he is perfecting some hunting skill or making sure he won't get stung or bitten.

I know for sure I don't know for sure why my fellow Earthmates do what they do so I'll hold my human-centric judgment on my cat and dolphins for now.  Then again I doubt they give a shit! LOL          




 You made my point and yours.  God's existence can't be proved by perfection.  There is no perfection in nature, only adaptation to available opportunities.  What we think of as cruel in nature when compared to human actions is begging the wrong question. If perfection existed then we wouldn't be having this discussion.

Humans might think the blue-footed boobie is "heartless" when she won't let won't own offspring back into the nest after it falls out or is pushed out by a sibling but I believe it's wrong to place human emotions or judgments on animals.  

I don't think the insect that lays her eggs in the abdomen of another species that in turn eats it way out of it's host is anymore evil then dolphins or hyena's that "rape" each other.  Rather than being pointless, it has lead to the survival of many species.  This doesn't mean human behavior follows suit since we have developed the capacity for long-term consequences.  




 I would hazard a guess but when innocent people are hurt or killed because you gave that person free will just in order to test their devotion to you.....that is evil.  

 




 Would you not agree that the natural world is not evil?  Suffering is a part of nature but unnecessary suffering occurs because of someone's greed.  




 It says He deceived them which is lying.  




 I would say that the struggle for life among animals is amoral and not evil.  Evil, as defined in the bible, is knowing right from wrong but conscientiously choosing wrong.   




 Here comes the textual argument.  I have, have you?  I was confirmed in the church and after finally reading the bible thoroughly and not just what was picked out for me I understood what they were trying to shield me from.   




 I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the Lord do all these things.

Isaiah 45:7

If He doesn't DO evil he damn sure created it which is worse, IMO. 




 Why then does he do it by proxy?  Ezekial 14:9 and 2 Thessalonians 2:11 




 Where does it say in the bible God can't do evil or lie? 




 I haven't ignored you Furo Ergo Sum.  I've been involved with life's distractions otherwise known as reality.  Forgive me.

What I meant my your prejudices is the resistance by you to acknowledge the basic female or baseline development of many organisms.  

Not all animals reproduce sexually.  Some animals such as Aphids that normally reproduce sexually will reproduce asexually through the mother producing only daughters and will only produce males during certain citations.  I can think of no instance when a male organism has ever been able to reproduce asexually.  I'm not saying males are irrelevant in our species but they aren't the go-to sex biologically.

Whether or not you think Jost's experiments mean anything is irrelevant.  Science did and does appreciate his contribution to the understanding of embryology.  You have missed the point. 

I'll try one more time.

For people to get the traits encoded in their genes, the genes need to be turned on. You can think of a gene as a recipe. A recipe in a cookbook does you no good until you open the book, get the ingredients and follow the instructions

The same is true with our genes. In our analogy, the gene is the recipe and the cookbook is the chromosome (a large collection of recipes). The gene needs to be "read" by the cell in order for it to do what it should.  However, the gene may be misread or the chromosomes are faulty. 

By studying why chromosomes/genes act why they do, medical science hopes to understand other medical diseases.

When you add the influence of hormones to the genes it becomes really complicated. 

 




 There was a Seinfeld episode on this as was other little niggling petpeaves on the show. I recall it had to do with the " Bubble Boy" and Jerry trying to follow George down the Parkway.  

Was Jerry driving too slow or was George driving too fast?   Maybe, maybe not.  All I know is I got to use the word niggling in context.   




 Two packaged boiled and peeled eggs.   




 "Methinks you do protest too much!" and with so much mindless moronic cussing and bold face type to try and bolster your points;  you come off as defensive.  I take your response, "who cares" telling.  Obviously you do so and in a big phallic way!  

The original discussion began in an attempt to reconcile genesis with biology and why the bible asserted women came from men and not the other "natural" way around.  You have outed your prejudices by denying the science you claim you aspire a degree in.  Good luck with that young student.

 




 Actually it's the number of old people having sex. 




 I agree with you that it happens not only to teens but way into adulthood also but you don't need to be mean to discover your own self-worth.  It's never justified either in childhood or adulthood. 




 Your assertion that male and female tissues develop in tandem and that only the external genitalia remains ambiguous is wrong (typical guy, only concerned on what's on the outside lol!).  

The Wolffian ducts develops 2 weeks before the Mullarian ducts.  Males will lose all remnants of the M ducts and females will eventually lose the W duct itself but not its undifferentiated gonad.  Those become the ovaries. Without the interference of testosterone and a antiMullarian hormone from the testis the fetus will continue on to develop as a female.  Males will develop their penis and scrotum from what would have become the clitoris and labia folds.

Perhaps during the course of your "studies" you will come across the work of Professor Alfred Jost, a French endocrinologist.  His experiments with rabbits proved that if you removed the undifferentiated gonads the animal will default (his words, not mine) to the female sex.  

After the holiday break go back to school and learn the difference between sex determination, sex differentiation and undifferentiated tissue.  Hopefully then all this will all make sense to you.  If not just ask your professor or better yet, spend hours contemplating your own nipples.  Happy New Year!   




 The cop told me to reschedule my court date and said if he doesn't show up the ticket has to be dismissed if I plead not guilty.  

Turns out if you live in a big city and you reschedule the issuing officer will either not be notified in time or will not be able to be present.  That being said it may just be a Texas law that the officer must be present and it definitively won't work in a small town.      




 Right after 911 when I was in the military I was pulled over in a school zone along with several other cars.  He walked down the line taking our license plates numbers then came up to us individually for our DL and registration.  When he came to me and found out I was military he mumbled, "You have better things to do" and told me how to beat the ticket even though he had to write it.  

It worked and has worked every time I've received any kind of moving violation. 




 Okay, I'll play.  At conception, the zygote has sex chromes that are either XX(female) or XY(male). The mother's egg always gives X but the father's sperm determines the extra X or Y which determines the potential sex of the child.  Sometimes, as in the case with all sexual dimorphism, there will be anomalies such as males having XXY, XXYY or females with only X.  Most will present as males having female attributes due to the lack of the dominate influence of testosterone from the developing organs and the hormonal influence.  

Genes not only determine the sex but they play a part in determining when hormones turn of and on and subsequently how further developments happen.  It's not written in stone guys but it's incrementally important.  

Even the emotional state of the mother can influence production of hormones that can have an effect on her baby.
  




 I doubt you could even make one coherent argument to challenge this opinion.    




 Infuriating isn't it.  I do have one correction for Paxalot.  Although female is the default mode until genes and hormones come into play, the zygote and subsequent fetus aren't really female or male but have the potential for both.  If you must rely on genes themselves it's telling that males are one chromosome off from females and not the other way around. Few die-hard misogynists will even acknowledge the science of embryology like some congress"men" from my state!  

The point though is even with our scientific understanding why do some people subscribe to an ancient mythology that reduces the importance of females and consequently subjugates them to males?    




 Ignorance is understandable.  Willful ignorance is just sad and pathetic.  




 A lot of people think "heroin addict" and just don't get it.  Lots of riders live normal lives as long as they can stave off the withdraw.  You don't get high, you just don't get sick.  Still it's a pretty shitty existance.   




 Pretty much most of my family was/is sociopathic, addicted or manipulative but I've mostly known this since I was a teenager.

That said, the only person in my inner circle that turned out to be really, really bad was my brother-in law.  

I first met him when I was pregnant in the mid nineties.  He had married a woman with a young daughter and she was pregnant with their child.  They had bought a house and seemed happy and normal.  A year later we stayed for a couple of nights with them during vacation.
Never saw anything out of the normal.  He maybe drank a little too much but nothing out of the ordinary for a southern redneck IYNWIM!

After some years they divorced as did I so I only followed my BIL through my ex and son.  Turns out he had a pretty serious drinking problem and eventually spent time in a state prison for a felony DUI where they took his DNA which is standard procedure.

Turns out his DNA turns up as a match for a murder that was nearly 20 old in another state.  The case was featured on TV for unsolved murders.  In short, a mother of two who worked as a dancer at a strip club was found murdered by her two young kids and the babysitter in her trailerhouse two years before I met him. 

An investigation followed and he confessed to her murder.  He's still awaiting trial.  

It still creeps me out that I stayed in the same house with a murderer with my newborn and that my kid grew up around him.    




 I'm not particularly good at rap or poetry so I'll give you my best suggestion.  

You've made millions promoting a thug lifestyle that influenced countless impressionable kids to embrace morals that weren't exactly beneficial to them.  You then had kids of your own and changed your song.  Good for you.  Glad you realized the impression media has on youth.

IMHO, you should rap about being the Scrooge, what with the negative attitude toward the police and then make a video of you rapping about how the police can be your friend and school is cool.

You asked, just sayin'

Good speed to you and your campaign.   




 DamnitGoose now the long needle dicks will feel inadaquate! 




 This is why girls are bad at math! 




 Almost!  My SO was tending a fire and some embers landed on the carpet in front of the hearth and he was so consumed with the fire that he didn't know that our carpet had caught fire.  I put it put with his beer.  




 I'm going to do this and film the results. 
 




 It was only the towels and matches but the worst was the toothpaste in the carpet 




 Even with gas it takes forever to get dry wood to burn. 




 We lost the Scopes Trial just like Evolutionists wanted.  We wanted to take it to the Supreme Court but the judge, just like a sidewinder, devised a way to prevent it by knowingly setting the fine himself to $100 instead of the jury which was supposed to be under $50 and so under the law the verdict was thrown out along with any chance of appeal.  Never underestimate your opponent no matter how misguided. 




 Unless you've been raised in this religion it seems strange the a God has to sacrifice his godson's life to absolve humans of their failings that the Christian god knew would happen in the first place.  What can be gained by having someone else suffer except a sense of guilt.  
  According to the Jews, the real Messiah was not to be the sacrificial lamb that leads to heaven.  The Jewish religion proscribes no heaven nor hell.  The messiah was to lead the Jews from persecution to a peaceful reign of the Jews over this world.  The big change from Judaism to Christianity and Muslim was this point.  Xtians and Muslims focus on a reward in an afterlife and Jews are about a reward in this life.
  Get it?  Got it?   Duh!!!! 




 Listen to the song first. 









 I'll try. A sacrifice means that what you gave can never be returned. Period.  Final.  God never sacrificed his son because he was reincarnated and lives forever within His houses.   




 No, no you don't, at least not in Fort Worth, Texas.   




 Good grief!  Get over the idea that music, art, or even culinary expressions can't be expressed and enjoyed by people of all faiths.

I'm atheist and I love gospel music, the paintings of the ideologues of the Greek Orthodox church, and hot-cross buns.  

Worship is one thing....appreciation is another. 




 Do you really believe that your product is that good?  I mean do you stand behind all the company hype?  I ask this because they have moved into burger heaven areas and after the newness rubs off, all that's left is well a good but not great burger. 




 A better question is why are some Christians obsessed with Biblical literalism especially when it comes to forcing their own views down the throats of American public school children. 
  
  As an atheist, I don't have any problem with an American Indian believing that a tarantula created the earth or any of the other 4,000 or so Creation stories.  Why should I?  Everyone has an opinion and I, as a veteran, defended their ability to hold and cherish them whether right or wrong.

  What I and others have a problem with is when a faction of this country seeks to demand that their religion is supreme above all.  They declare that the majority of our forefathers were Christians so that means we are a Christian nation.  The fact that the majority were Christians doesn't mean their intentions were to make this country's government tied to Christianity in anyway shape or form.  Let me say this again,  The fact that the majority were Christians doesn't mean their intentions were to make this country's government tied to Christianity in anyway shape or form.

Get it?,  Got it?,  Good!

No one is trying to take away any of your rights! Believe what you want, we just don't want taxpayer's money paying for religious symbols for select Americans and unless you want the idea of an intelligent  God-tarantula being taught then let the public schools stick with strict math and science sans the ID stuff. 

Sorry but there's no geological evidence of any world-wide flood but it's not surprising that cultures all over the world can relate to a flood since they happen everywhere.  At least that's what my insurance agent told me lol. 




 You are pretty fucking stupid and don't deserve any disability from SS and if your Ins. paid then you should pay them back for your own stupidity.  Sorry about your crappy looking toes but it doesn't beat my uncle when he raised up the running lawnmower and sliced of several of the tips of his fingers.  You both belong in a pile of morons and drive up the cost of insurance! 




 Owls?  I love owls.  Owls love to eat.  Owls love to eat rodents.  Owls also love to eat a small rodent like Chihuahua dog that lives next door that likes to yip and bark for hours on end.  Yea owls!  I love owls.  And hawks, vultures, ect.  Did I say I love owls? 




 As I load their bags with candy I think I'll whisper, "In Satan's name.". LOL 




 Prayer, in its simplest form that I was taught as a child is NOT asking  God or Jesus any help for me or anyone else. Prayer is not to ask for special favors even when you want something that you think is special.

Praying is only to acknowledge, reflect and confirm your faith in Jesus and not some magical path for health or prosperity for you or your family to (lose) pay money into.
 Please don't be mislead!
If even two people pay attention to me and recognize not only the religious scams churches use, but they will enlist your help to place your elderly parents or relative in a substandard retirement home where they receive kickbacks. Sounds lovely?! Don't bet on any of it.  They will take your money and spend it on new golf clubs before the ink is signed on your parents contract! 




 The gospels provide clues to the life of Jesus but the actual life and death of Jesus was never and has never been corroborated by any outside sources including the Romans' that had this habit of recording everything that they could. 




 I won't say that this film was misunderstood as the film didn't reflect the original story but the damage was done to the collective conscience of the viewing public and the original story was lost.  I refer to the original "Frankenstein".

The movie made the story out to be a cautionary tale about the evils and limits of scientific exploration, portraying the monster as a non-verbal, grunting, sub-human. The book, in fact, portrays the monster helping an unknowing family and learns how to communicate in French. Later, he gives a touching soliloquy to his maker that turned his back on him.  

The book was not a tale of science over-extending itself but a commentary of how a society can turn a person with potential empathy and intelligence into what they define is a monster.  The latter being much more scary and relevant to modern society!  




 "Death is from sin nature"

The idea of original sin has been a sticking point for me since I was a child.  To conscientiously punish the progeny for a mistake their parents made is akin to justifying a caste system.  Your parents screwed up so I'm gonna make your existence while you're alive almost unbearable but if you praise me enough I'll reward you after I let you die which I don't have to do but because your parents disobeyed me, who didn't know any better because I never taught them what disobedience meant because I didn't want them to know any better. This made no sense to the naive 10 year old me then it does now.

My great-grandfather was a Baptist preacher. I was confirmed into the Episcopalian Church at age 10 and have been studying various religions including Christianity for the past 40 years.  Some things have become clear to me concerning Christianity.

A great deal of guilt is laid on Christian children just for being born. They are told that because of original sin sex is bad but necessary and even their future death is also because of sin.  All this adds up to atonements, offerings, sacrifices to the priests that can direct them to a way to escape death and live forever, (which as far as I know, no one has been able to do) and makes the priests, reverends, popes etc., rich while robbing the hopeful yet gullible. 
  
The sad thing is that while pinning their hopes on an "afterlife" they neglect and dismiss a precious opportunity of self-conscientiousness that is the rare occurrence of life. 

Instead of embracing and cherishing what they have, they claim that this fragile life on this fragile planet means nothing.

You talk about moral absolutes and call me a hypocrite but all I know is that I only have this life as a human on this planet and I will cherish and help future life here as long as it lasts.

Death is the rebirth of life and it's natural and OK!
    




 What?  I've been drinking straight from the cartons since I was I kid. Oh no, suddenly I feel sic..... 




 Who Louis Armstrong was.  When I was stationed in New Orleans I found out that my boyfriend, who was from Pittsburg, PA didn't know who he was even though the airport there is named after him. He had been there for over three years.  It's a wonderful world! 




 It does and I can understand your dilemma.  I apologize for some of the conclusions I jumped to.

I had to pull some strings to get stationed where my parents were.  My 4'3" mother had to have a double hernia surgery from lifting my 6'2" step-dad after his heart surgery and stroke and they needed my help.  After I got there I found out that they owed the IRS $6500 or they would lose their house.  I took out a loan and paid the IRS. I stayed there for another year rent free to recoup the loan.  I thought about buying the house but because of foundation problems I decided not to. 

They eventually settled on a reverse mortgage which worked out well.

However, I did this with an income of around $43,000.  How you bought a $180,000 home on an income of only 18k at the time or even 25k makes anyone wonder. 

Good on ya and at least, even if it's an after thought, you are  taking care or advantage of your relatives. 

Good luck to you sir! 
 




 "Its my dad's place. he was not well so I came back and am helping with everything. sister moved back in and mom was losing her place (they are divorced but its friendly) so she moved in too."

So you came back to your dad's place to help by having him move in with you? You're not being coherent.  




 Just responding to your response actually concerning the house.  It was you that indicated the house was still owned by your father. JS 




 Jesmay, have you ever really read the bible cover to cover on your own without someone there to interpret it for you?  No matter, I have and I will give you just one passage:

Isaiah 13:15-18 NLT

Bueno noches! 




 Once again, since you aren't legally responsible to pay the property and school tax for your parents, it doesn't count as your tax burden for the purpose of your argument.  When I agreed to pay my parents' property tax it was only to help them; the same as if I paid their electric bill, bought a new AC unit for their home, or even sent them on their dream vacation to Italy.  I still paid my own taxes and because it wasn't my home I couldn't write off or apply my VA disability discount on my federal returns. 

It's nice that you're "helping" your parents but it sounds like you are definitely receiving a benefit here because you're not paying rent.  Having lived in PA I know that $7612 a year would be considered pretty cheap rent for for renting a house that size.  Also it's interesting that you collect the rental income from a property you don't own and report that as personal income.  

Sounds like you have positioned yourself into a comfortable situation where you can live rent free on only 18k plus; supplementing your income by renting rooms in your parents house to other relatives.  

Good job! You still misrepresented yourself, have offered no argument about the ACA and have shown yourself to be a opportunistic moocher and family blood-sucker.  Did it ever occur to you that when they leave/or die it may not be yours?  Maybe so but from what I gather you've probably made sure the will is in order to your benefit.

This sounds like a clear -cut case of elder abuse to me!  
























 I think it depends on where in the US you are.  The British section at one of local grocery stores is great (no haggis though).  It's the only place I can find Salad Cream!
Wonder if they have an American or Canadian section in England?  









 Chicken Spaghetti

5oz spaghetti noodles, dried or 12oz cooked
1 Tbls butter
1 Tbls bacon grease
1 large onion, med diced
1 bell pepper, med diced
10 to 12 med white or crimini mushrooms, sliced thick
3 garlic cloves, minced
1 tsp Worchestershire sauce
2 tsp dark chili powder
1 Tbls all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups chicken stock
3 ripe Roma tomatoes, chopped
1/2 cup Chili sauce (not the Asian kind)
3/4 cup half   half or heavy cream
1 Tbls parsley, dried or 2 Tbls, fresh
2 cups diced or shredded cooked chicken, preferably not canned
1/2 cup sliced pimiento-stuffed green olives
2 cups med cheddar cheese (8oz), grated

1. Cook the spaghetti in a large amount of heavily salted water.  Drain. Do not rinse. Set aside.
2. Heat the butter and bacon grease in a large skillet over medium heat.  Cook onions, bell pepper and mushrooms until onions are translucent. Add garlic, Worcestershire and chili powder.  Cook for 1 more minute.
3.  Sprinkle in the flour and stir to incorporate well. Let cook for 1 minute stirring constantly to prevent burning the 'roux'.
4. Add the chicken stock, diced tomatoes and chili sauce. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer and cook for 30 minutes, until slightly thickened. 
5. Remove from heat. Stir in half   half, olives, parsley and chicken.  Stir to incorporate well.  Add spaghetti and cheese and toss well. Return pan to med low heat until it bubbles slightly and cheese melts but do not let boil.

This recipe can be made up to step 5 without adding the chicken and cheese then layered and baked casserole style in a greased baking dish at 350F for 25 minutes. Spaghetti, chicken, cheese and repeat but I feel this is unnecessary.  




 Of course you would and probably if she were a real woman! Sick F *K 









 And this is also why a good deal of people that believe this waste the precious time and opportunity they have while alive and couldn't care less about the desecration of the Earth even though the god they supposedly believe in made them the Earth's caretaker.   




 Well you're half way there by recognizing the your anger and the desire to recognize help from your fellow chefs.  Remember, you aren't performing brain surgery and no one will actually die.  Try to be more of a cheerleader than an individual, especially at this stage.  No successful commercial kitchen I know of has ever been run by one person alone. 




 That's what I thought.  I liked to mix a little plain yogurt and honey with a little cinnamon or allspice.    




 At sea! 




 Geoff, exactly what kind of slavery was it? 




 The french bread used for po-boys in New Orleans. Almost impossible to find anywhere else and I've found no recipe that successfully recreates it.  Soft and slightly chewy in the inside and so crackly on the outside you will be brushing crumbs off you no matter how careful you are.  It literally makes the sandwich.  No other bread comes close.  There are only 3 bakeries that make it but the best by far is Leidenheimer Baking Co.   




 What is the dipping sauce? 




 Aunt Tacca's Mock Cheese Souffle

8 slices of reg white bread, decrusted. You can use any other type of bread just make sure it's decrusted.
butter
1 lbs sharp cheddar cheese, finely grated
6 eggs
3 cups milk or half   half
Tabasco and salt to taste

   Butter one side of ea slice of bread and cut ea in 9 squares.  Butter 9x13 pyrex dish.  Put bread in bottom with buttered side up.  Sprinkle cheese on top of bread.  Beat eggs well.  Add milk and Tabasco and salt to taste.  Pour over cheese and bread.  Lightly push everything into the milk mixture so everything in wet.  Let set overnight in the fridge.  Remove and bring to room temp.  Bake at 350F for 45 min. or until lightly brown and bubbly.  
 




 .... its gotta be Frito Pie! 









 You should really try making fresh ricotta.  All you need is whole milk or 1-2% plus some heavy cream, lemon juice and salt and white pepper.  No need to use raw milk as you have to bring it to a low boil anyway.  

I've made mozz before but I found it's not worth it to me because of the necessity of buying citric acid and rennet which I have no other use for and of course all that stretching.  I prefer to by either whole soft mozz or a block of low-moisture mozz but never the shredded stuff because they coat it with a chemical to prevent it from sticking together which effects its melting quality.  

Have fun and post your results!  




 The recipe is pretty self-explanatory but I will provide micro recipes if anyone needs it. 




 You must really, and I mean REALLY like rice! 









 Oops, I meant fettuccine.  




 Mother Teresa is/was no saint or even someone that had what we would think of as a modicum of a moral compass.  She rejoiced in the suffering of her charges and did little to alleviate suffering while rifling billions into the coffers of the bloated Catholic Church all the while enjoying the jet-set status of a billionaire and received firstclass health-care in the states in her final years.  I guess her final suffering was above those that truly could have used compassion.   Hundreds of women suffered needlessly because of Mother Teresa and ironically that is exactly the way she wanted it! Sick!!!! 




 Congratulations to your uncle!  So few people know how hard and prestigious it is to attain a Masterchef certification from the AFC.  Thousands of people graduate from culinary schools such as the CIA, FBI and Le Cordon Blue every year who can't hold a candle to the few hundred chefs that are industry recognized as THE BEST!  

You're are so lucky to get advice from someone so knowledgeable and thank you for passing it along to the average cook!  

I'm curious though, in your family, who was the best or worst cook and did that lead to his culinary inspiration?  




 The fat German was so hungry he almost wolfed down the entire sandwich before stopping to take a picture of it!    




 Yea but can you cook a proper French omelet? 




 Please tell me you also made homemade ricotta too? 




 Well, okay.  If you do it will just about reach mid-calf lol! 




 A bushel is about 8 gallons or anywhere from 32 to 50+ lbs depending on what is being wieghed.  I dig dill.  I even made a "dill dough" once but that's a lot of dill bro!  Did you mean a bunch? 









 Great job!  I'd love to do a prime rib but I can't seem to find one in any of my grocery stores.  Do I have to go to a butcher shop? 




 Very nice! 




 I only got the one plate at a garage sale but I had to have it! 




 Here ya go!  Sorry, I got sidetracked.

Rice Krispie   Peanut Butter Cup Brownies

Yield: 18 to 24 brownies

Cook Time: 45 minutes

Total Time: 3 hours
Ingredients:
For Brownie Base:

    3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter
    1 3/4 cups semisweet chocolate chips, divided
    1 1/2 cups granulated sugar
    1/2 cup light brown sugar, packed
    1/2 teaspoon instant espresso powder or 2 tablespoons brewed coffee (optional)
    1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
    3 large eggs
    1 cup all-purpose flour
    8 full-sized peanut butter cups, chopped, or 1 cup mini peanut butter cups

For Crispie Topping:

    1 1/2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
    1 1/2 cups creamy peanut butter
    1 tablespoon butter
    1 1/2 cups crisp rice cereal

Directions:

    Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 9-by-13-inch baking pan with aluminum foil; spray lightly with cooking spray.
    Combine butter and 3/4 cup chocolate chips in a large microwave safe bowl. Heat on high power for 60 to 90 seconds, stirring every 10 to 15 seconds to prevent scorching. When chocolate is melted and mixture is smooth, stir in sugar and brown sugar. Batter may seem grainy, that's ok.
    Add the coffee or espresso powder and vanilla extract and stir until smooth.
    Whisk in eggs until incorporated. Sprinkle the flour over top and fold until just combined. Stir in 1/2 cup chocolate chips then pour batter into prepared pan.
    Bake for about 25 minutes or until brownies are mostly done. Remove from oven and sprinkle chopped peanut butter cups and remaining 1/2 cup chocolate chips over top, then return to oven and bake for 3 to 4 minutes more. Transfer pan to wire rack to cool.
    Meanwhile, to prepare topping, combine 1 1/2 cups chocolate chips, peanut butter, and butter in a large microwave safe bowl. Heat on high power for 1 minute, stirring every 10 to 15 seconds, until melted and smooth. Add rice cereal and toss to coat. Spread cereal mixture in a smooth layer on top of brownies, then cover and refrigerate for at least 90 minutes or overnight, or until topping is cooled and set before slicing and serving. Brownies will keep, refrigerated in an airtight container, for up to 1 week.

 









 A honey sriracha dressing.  




 Hard to see but the bun was lightly toasted, dawg. 




 Your doing it wrong!!  Hamberogology dictates that the greens, especially whole lettuce leafs be placed under the burger but above the lower part of the bun called the "heel" in order to catch the juicy drippings but also to lead them away down your hand and elbow, which may result in a juicy, tasty lick-fest but will also prevent the dreaded soggy, soaked bottom bun.  Shredded lettuce is another topic and will be addressed in my next online school of Hamberogology. 




 It just occurred to me that this would be a great name for a Food Truck in a Bark Park LOL  




 Give it a good spicy Thai peanut sauce base, add Asian pickled carrots and red onions then finish with a honey Sriracha dressing along with some  chopped scallions and your on your way my friend ; ) 




 Si 









 Kind of hard when we don't know what you have. 




 nope 




 You are correct! I should have made that distinction. 




 Most Christian thought begins with the ideological framework that this planet was made especially by God just for humans.  Mankind was ultimately God's Special Creation and even after the "Fall" mankind was to have dominion of the Earth until mankind had no more use for it because of the Rapture.  

Atheists, Humanists and some religions understand and accept as fact that the world we live in has produced millions of species of animals and plants, most of which (95%) have become extinct.  They do not subscribe to the idea that humans are the pinnacle of all creation but only a fortunate twig that happened to survive in a fairly recent geological fortunate turn of events on the so-called tree of life.

Some Christians label Atheist as arrogant because they believe Atheist see themselves as some sort of god or above a god.

Atheist, on the other hand, view the Christian view that the world exists just for humans arrogant as well. 

What are some Christian perspectives on this subject?
  

         




 We'd call this a Breakfast Chalupa were I'm from in Texas but close enough Amsterdam!  Looks even better than most served here! 




 Yes, German settlers in the Hill Country in Texas found they could take a tough cut of beef, pound the hell out of it till it begged for Absolution, soak it in a little buttermilk to further tenderize it, then cook it just like a weinerschnitzel! 




 Why can't I find Prime rib in the stores in Texas?  Is it called something else now? 




 Always put lettuce on the bottom! It prevents the juice from the burger from soaking into the "heel" of the bun so the burger won't disintegrate in your hands.  Other than that, great job!   




 I'm getting my aquarium ready just in case!  Probably would add a tiny toy Spock lol! 




 What are they good for?,  absolutely nothing! 

 Well, except they're so cute! 




 Chicken Fried Steak is probably based on the German dish, wienerschnitzel.  Texas has a significant population with German heritage that goes way back.  So much so that German tourists who visit the Hill Country in Texas can't or just barely understand what they are saying.  They also gave us great beer and Kolaches!   




 What, no kippers?  Seriously though, I now have "Breakfast In America" stuck in my head.  Looks great!  




 Those are some sexy brussels sprouts!  The mound of arugula could use a touch of vinaigrette unless it just there to make you think you're eating somewhat healthy *chuckle*    




 Texas, where to begin?  Pecan-encrusted chicken fried steak with poblano creme sauce served with one smoked brisket and cream cheese stuffed jalapeno with a side of fresh salad of Dandelion greens, topped a smattering of no-bean beef chili, roasted corn, avocado chunks and crushed Fritos drizzled with nacho cheese sauce.  




 California is a big state but here goes,  Take Tri-tip braised with Anchor Steam, slice thinly on a bed of Kale and Arugula.  Add marinated artichoke hearts, avocado slices and Sourdough croutons.  Use a Caesar dressing and finish with a fresh California poached chicken egg.    




 Exactly my thought.  This was New Orleans and because they are sue happy I had to pay higher premiums while I was stationed there.  

The worst thing was we both worked in the same building and I had to pass her in the hall wearing her neck brace for a non-injury on my dime!   




 I gotta ask....what are cat head biscuits?
 




 She was deaf and they thought that would be an advantage (sympathy) to her case even though they found no fault.  I still have the letter lol!  At least they didn't raise my rates. 




 What if you have the same insurance company?  Would it really make any difference to them?  Doubt they would sue themselves LOL! and in the end they could pick who they wanted to jack-up the ins policy rate.  




 My insurance company decided to settle when the "victim" threatened a lawsuit even though it was under 5 mph, no damage to either car and she refused medical treatment after requesting an ambulance.  Ask me why.  




 English is a very rich language!  It's why we say we eat beef and pork instead of steer and pig but we say we eat chicken and lamb instead of poultry and baby sheep.  

Basic cooking methods are traditionally divided into two categories, dry heat and moist heat.  Dry heat includes roasting/baking, broiling, pan-frying, saute and deep-fry.  Moist methods include boiling, simmering, poaching, braising, stewing and steaming.  I may have missed a few but it's getting late here.

Souping, currying and gravying are not cooking methods.  You can use varying cooking method to achieve a soup. An example would be braising onions and simmering a veal stock for reduction for a French Onion Soup.  

If I make a soup I may use many techniques but no one would call that "souping"

As for my vegetarian friends.  I sort off appreciate the many ways vegetables have been "disguised" as meat but at the end of the day they aren't and don't have to be cooked the same as "meat".   




 I'll let you know! 




 Was going to make Chicken Spaghetti then I ran across this!  Wondering if I should serve over spaghetti like Cincinnati Chili.     




 Stewing is a style of cooking and not a dish.  A stew is made up of smallish pieces of protein that are first pan-seared then cooked in a liquid much like braising.  The kind of protein, liquid and any additions used are wholly up to the imagination.   




 Ask for "the Animal" 




 Well if you consider Fort Worth close.  It's from Salsa Fuego.  Great burgers and Tex Mex that was rated #5 in the state by "Texas Monthly" 




 Usually made with Parmesan yes?   Molded into cups or bowls.  If you're a true foodie you'd refer it as as a frico.  This however, is something altogether different.  This is cheese love, or cheese chips!   




 The locals lovingly refer to it as "the golden halo". 









 Hats off to Salsa Fuego in Fort Worth for this masterpiece of burgerdome! 




 You shouldn't worry so much about how to pay for college, rather you should be more worried about how to pass your courses. 

 Your English is abysmal.  Look into a remedial class first.  You can take some online for free! 




 Did this all the time as a night baker in the Navy!  When I worked in a Flag Mess sometimes I'd have to go the Navy Exchange as soon as it opened to buy beer for beer cheese soup.  The looks I got! LOL 




 If I had a restaurant I'd give a discount to people for things like having well-behaved children or correcting misbehaving children.  I would also offer a discount for patrons with no children but have had to deal with disruptive kids around them.  If not a discount, at least offer a free dessert.     




 To begin with I'm not convinced that the Exodus ever actually occurred but that has no bearing whatsoever on my conclusions.  The lineage of the Jewish people is not based in Egypt.  

Your assertion that most Jews in Israel aren't really Jewish is false.  Anyone today, for as little as a $100 DNA test, can trace their ancestry back to a specific geographical location all over the world.  Interestingly Arabs and Jews have a very close DNA indicating they are from the same stock.

Anywho... your comment about the Jewishness of the Jews in Israel has absolutely no bearing on your assertion of the supposed benevolent principles of Jewish Law and subsequent "tweaking" by Jesus of traditional Hebrew laws.           




 "All jewish law is derived from the principles of loving god and loving your neighbor."  I'm throwing down the BS card.

Your statement is about half right.  The Hebrews of the OT may have loved their god but they and their god certainly didn't love their neighbors especially when it was inconvenient for them.  

The majority of Christians are unaware of the atrocities committed by Hebrews (god commanded it or was committed by their god alone) because their Christian education consisted of simplistic Christian children's books, children's bible studies or what their family told them but have never actually read a bible.  Most Christians are woefully ignorant of what the bible actually says and instead of actually reading it they depend on some so-called "expert" such as a preacher, priest or minister to read it and then explain and "interpret" it to them.  

The "golden rule" factor was not and is not a part of the Hebrew faith.  

Case in point, look at what they are doing now. the Christian political dupes who just want to hold onto what political power they have cow-towed to the demands of AIPAC that holds way to much political influence already.   




 Homo Erectus, wasn't that the title for a gay porn film? 




 Plus it's a school for non-English speakers where homophones are one of the most difficult but an important part of the English language to grasp. 




 Some psychotic people and some animals may lack morality (amoral) but all humans have an innate sense of right and wrong, that is they know it's bad to crap in the bathtub of the world even if it benefits them (which it doesn't because it's their bathtub too).  They are moral if they don't act on this awareness and are immoral if they are aware but do anyway. (no pun intended)

Amoral doesn''t equal immoral so I think your kids are safe. 




 I've asked this too and usually received a reply along the lines of the "Golden Rule" but like you said that rule is mostly culturally and religiously universal but is still not even fully adhered to in the bible.  I've never received a well-defined answer to this question and probably never will.     




 You are why I believe religion has a place in society even though I myself have no belief in eternal damnation.  Personally, people like you scare me. 




 These so-called "family friendly" hypocrites force their employees to sign a document that essentially negates their federally afforded and constitutional protections from discrimination in order to be employed.  Republicans will say that they have the choice to sign and work for HL or go someplace else but this is more common than you think and will most certainly and exponentially grow and when you're desperate for a job to feed your family you shouldn't have to worry about signing away your civil rights for a job.  HL and companies like them should not be allowed to violate federal laws that protect citizens from discrimination.   These "contracts" must be outlawed as a condition of any employment.    




 Most certainly he will cling to his Christianity more strongly than ever since his religion promises him a ticket to heaven if he sincerely repents and accepts Jesus as his savior.  Meanwhile non-Christians, some of whom never even heard of Jesus or didn't hurt anyone will burn in hell forever simply because they never acknowledged him.  This god/Jesus person sounds like a narcissistic sociopath, IMO, who only cares whether humanity praises him.  

This really is the opposite of a true love that seeks no compensation or pay off.  Why would a perfect god need validation or admiration from it's creation?         




 I'm going to culinary school.  Last week we were told we don't actually fry eggs.  What we are actually doing is sauteing an egg.  Then we actually deep fried a whole egg and the result was interesting.  I took this one step further by just deep-frying an egg yolk.  Eureka!  It held it shape, can be handled and looks nice.   




 I'm so ready to try using my waffle iron for hashbrowns. I think it would work better than a panini press.  




 You have been bought up in a faith and you believe in it hook, line, and sinker because it's what you know and what they told you to believe.  The same happens to all kids in the middle east.  ????????????????  




 "False, everyone knows God exists, and comes to this conclusion naturally"

Calling the BS flag here. The thing is, if this were even remotely true, you have to be able define the attributes of your particular god before you can have a belief and babies/children do not come by this naturally.  

"The message is restricted because God only plans to save some people."

Your response shows exactly why the OP posted his question.  Your response indicates that your god is only interested in his "chosen people" and doesn't care about other people he had created. From what his "chosen people" have told me they don't want this.

"Allowing sinful creatures to be born so they could be punished is not in itself evil unless you want to argue that justice is evil."

It could be said that your argument justifies the abuse and punishment of every child born.  According to you there is not one innocent baby born.  Obviously you are not a parent and I hope that you never become one. 




 God supposedly created all things including good and evil.....on purpose. 




 Your first statement is completely presumptive.  No one is born knowing a god or gods exist.  They only know what they are exposed to and learn what is expected of them from their culture.  Additionally, no one that "knows" a god exists and understands the consequences would willfully disobey a commandment of a god because of abject fear, unless they were mentally ill but that's another issue. 

Your second premise, that a god is not unjust in not revealing its' nature and expectations to all of humankind because it doesn't owe it to them, doesn't make any sense especially if that god is omnipotent.  Why would the "message" be restricted to only a tiny part of humanity especially if that was the means to salvation?  Why were there "chosen people" in the first place? 

The fact that the early origins of all religions were restricted to isolated groups indicates, not an omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent god/gods, but only a belief system or mythology based on the actual living conditions of the group at that time.  
 




 Did you realize that you are the 666 commenter? lol 




 Most of my clients have dog doors leading to their back yards.  Some can walk their dogs but can't drive to a store as is the case with my blind client. 




 Who are you to say they "shouldn't" have a pet.  Often that is the only companion they have on a daily basis because they are home-bound.  

You seem to have a lack of empathy coupled with an extremely  judgmental attitude about people and situations you know nothing about. 




 By mobility I mean not being able to get to a store.  Many are home-bound because they can't drive anymore but can still get around their house.  Meals on Wheels has enabled many seniors from having to move into a nursing home.  One of my clients is a young woman who is blind and another man was only 29 years old but enrolled in MOW temporarily after a leg injury left him unable to go down two flights of stairs.  




 You were right in the beginning,  that is a horrible thing to say.  FYI, client's services in Meals on Wheels are not based on income.  It's about mobility.  A lot of my clients pay money to MOW but they aren't required to.    




 I have a pet route along with my regular Meals on Wheels route.  I deliver pet food just once a month.  My regular route is only one day a week.  Both routes take only 1 1/2 hours at most.  I have become very close with most of my "clients" including the furry ones and it is one of the most rewarding things I do all week.  

If you can spare just 1 hour one day a week please consider becoming a Meals on Wheels volunteer.  They always need more volunteers!  




 It's the day before that blows! 




 Everyone's reactions are different.  A lot depends on emotional support or rejection from your partner, friends and family, the circumstances surrounding the pregnancy or any prior history of mental health problems.  

There are no scientifically valid studies that support the conclusion that the procedure itself causes any problems. 




 It was in the 80's, around $400.   




 Common arguments include the mother having regrets leading to severe depression and/or suicide.  Medical issues may include the inability to have children later or develop breast cancer.

 Having an abortion.  Not exactly a walk in the park but no latent physical or mental problems afterward. 




 I would agree except I always worry about bacteria growth from the grinding process.  I much prefer Beef Carpaccio.  




 I am trying to imagine the Jesus of Nazareth telling a starving person that feeding them wouldn't help others in the long run.  

Then again, according to Catholic doctrine, life on this earth is inconsequential and the only import is life after death(oxymoron) and the best way to get a good death/life is to suffer as Jesus did. 

So the masses are told to suffer while the priests live this life high on the hog.

Explain again why we, the masses, are skeptical of the motivations of a religious organization that has its own bank, government and voice at the UN that no other religion has?      




 Most "rednecks" make sure their kids get vaccines.  I should now as I proudly is one lol.  Seriously though most deniers are either immigrants or overly-educated, upper middle-class people who think they are smarter then the rest of society.   




 To let everyone know I'm an atheist.  I'll tell people if asked but I won't in anyway advertise it.  I'd like to wear the "A" on a necklace or put a sticker on my car but I'm afraid of vandalism or negative repercussions from my instructors and employers.    




 Glad to hear that he's your ex.  My question to you and one that you should consider very carefully is why you chose to ignore his rude remarks to you and women in general.  Why did you put up with his shit for a fraction of a second?  

You stuck up for your friend but not yourself?  Why?  You obviously knew that he was a a misogynist before hand yet stayed with him.  Are the "positive attributes" that good that you would put up with his crap?

Listen, I had a boyfriend that stood to inherit a 20 million dollar fortune which I didn't find out for a long time.  He was a drunk and and even his mother wanted me to marry him but after he tried straggling me in a drunken rage I fought back the way my mother taught me to.  I put my hat on and left.  Nothing is worth losing your own dignity.  You're better off and I hope you find your self-worth! 




 Considering the amount of plastic surgery that's done for no other reason then "enhancement" I have to disagree that mutilation of the body is only a primitive endeavor. Starving and binging in order to achieve a body style is as bad as foot binding and is done for the same reasons. 




 Nah, she just sort of gave up and had no interest in anything.  I guess you could say it was the "fuck it, I don't want live any longer" diet.  Not recommended for anyone just wishing to just lose a few pounds. 




 My "selfish cunt" of a grandmother went from 250 lbs to 74 lbs in 2 years before she died.  You're welcome you asshole! 




 Not quite, our coffins have longhorns on the front. 




 toilet paper! 




 I think that Mark Twain summed this up in his essay about the arrogance of humans in thinking they are more "successful" than clams or bacteria.

Lower and higher forms of life is purely a subjective point of view.  If twenty thousand generations of my relatives have lived and died in your gut since your birth and, at any one time, more of my kind reside there then all the humans that are living and have ever died, I'd have to declare victory.

Who knows?  Maybe God has a hard on for bacteria and beetles and humans were an afterthought.    




 Unfortunately my mother embraced this idea in her later life. Her mistake was not caring of others opinions vs. caring about others feelings.  She came to the mistaken belief that she was now "entitled" to treat anyone like crap because she was old. She died without any close friends.  Most of her family had limited contact and those that were there put up with it for money.  Sad
     
























 Had to share an office with our Food Service Officer, an O2.  He would sit for hours quietly staring at the same 2 pages from the NAVSUP-486 and no, he was not sleeping.  He went to a conference with our Chief.  He took a run in his dress socks that morning because he forgot his regular socks then showed up at the conference with no socks on.   Chief had to sit behind him where his lack of socks was clearing visible to everyone.  

At least once a week Chief would come into our office and tell me to take a break.  I'd always grab my smokes because I knew he'd be in there balling him out for a while.

The worst for me was when he changed into his whites in a small closet that was behind a partition on the other side of my desk.  In all fairness he did ask if this was okay.  He then tells me while he's changing that he accidentally wore dark underwear and would just have to go without!       




 This has become standard and I don't know why.  Telephones are inherently intrusive.  You aren't asking to be called and you have no obligation to identify yourself when you receive a phone call.  Back in the day, all callers would identify themselves first.  Me, "Hello".  Them, "I'm so and so from/with so and so, may I speak with so and so?" or informally, "it's me Jan".  You never got a call from anyone that asked you to identify yourself first!  Awkward call example.....

*Ring*  Answers the phone, "Hello".  Caller, "Hello, who is this?".  Me, "Who are you trying to call?".  Caller, "I'm trying to reach so and so".

Even more ridiculous examples are,  Me,"Hello".  Caller, "Is this so and so?".  Me, "Who's calling please?"   

The bottom line is that calling someone is no different then knocking on someone's front door.  It's polite and moreover safe to identify yourself first than ask for the person behind the door to identify themselves.     




 You must be younger than 40! 




 My mother and by extension, my unemployed, mooching brother and uncle that lived with her used the overdraft option to make what essentially were loans that eventually cost me 6000% of the original overdraft fee.

  I couldn't just transfer money into her account because it was so overdrawn.  I had to send the money Western Union that collected up to 25%. They played this game when I was still in the military and far enough away that they knew I'd still send money home in order to help my mother.  Not the banks fault at all! 




 Never works for sexual rape.  Won't work for food rape/pilfering either. 




 Wonder how many 50+ year old women will fess up to this product being there first "secret" dildo?  




 Before or after lol! 




 Croque Monsieur or Madame!  




 I love his name!  Our cats are the Charlie Llama and the Lucy Moose.  If I adopt a snake I shall name him Monty! 




 One must first have an intrinsic moral value in order to judge any religion good or bad.    




 Salad cream has a hint of horseradish and is delisious! 




 Indian vs Asian, Asian vs Chinese, Tex-Mex vs Hispanic??!!!!! 




 Looks like a jiffypop  




 Never add flour directly into a simmering or boiling liquid.  Sorry sean_incali.  It's guaranteed to form clumps and won't properly thicken.  

You can either coat the beef cubes with flour before you brown them which essentially produces a roux (preferred and will produce a nice crust) or you can bullf* k it, as we called it in the Navy, by making a beurre manie, which is simply equal parts butter to flour that is mixed well then added by the spoonful.   

The thickening ratio depends on how much liquid you use but generally it's 10 to 1, liquid to roux or beurre manie.  So, if you use ten cups of stock then you will need 1 cup of roux or BM.  Cornstarch is different. 1 oz of cornstarch + 1 oz water will thicken 16 oz or 2 cups of liquid.   




 Beautiful crust on the chicken so don't hide it. Are you ashamed of the veggies?  Bring them out from underneath!  Lots of color going to waste.  I'd plate the chicken at 10 o'clock slightly overlapping some of the veggies then trail the veggies around to form a comma.  Sauce at 6 o'clock with your micro garnish.  




 Yum! 




 Two all beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions on a sesame seed bun!  Sorry, got stuck in my head and had to let it out.  




 Yum! 




 Is that a full sized burger or a double slider? 




 The fourth to last one is a pizza with a porpoise. 




 Where's the final product? 









 Pillsbury I think. 




 Looking from the outside, the fact that Christianity is based on an innocent human sacrifice is enough to question its moral or ethical base.  Is it really so much different than throwing a virgin female into a volcano to appease an imaginary God!        




 I brushed the chops with olive oil then put them in a pan under low-medium heat. After about 1 minute  I upped the temp to med for another 30 seconds and finished at medium-high heat for the last 15 seconds.   









 For one whole year!   Any one want to challenge me? 




 Bread, tomatoes, onions, beef/lamb meat mixture, yogurt, cucumbers and spices and seasonings. I could live and survive be happy!   




 Whole mozz plus a little swiss and fresh grated parm. 




 I used pizza dough from a can for this first try.  Tasted pretty good but puffed up more than I wanted it to.  Next time I'll use my homemade pizza dough recipe. 









 I'd hate you for cutting off the tabs that keep the roll in place in order to make the ears.  I hate that people don't know what they're for, STOMP, STOMP, STOMP! 




 That's so sweet, thank you! 




 Not only was it the style or custom of the time it would have been considered blasphemous as a Hebrew not to marry and procreate as that would have crossed Gods commandment to be fruitful and multiply.  He would have been considered a very odd duck to say the least!  




 Before he went to bootcamp.  No jarhead.  Navy blackshoe here.  Field day is commonly used in the Navy too.  




 That's exactly what I got from Shorts28 reply. 




 Surprisingly no!  Only a couple of small blisters from the shortening. 




 He was fine.  He spent 2 1/2 hour cleaning the hoods that night! 




 I don't because there maybe people/customers that are on a low sodium diet and sodium it so prevalent everywhere. 




 If Christians were to follow the true teachings of Jesus then they would have to turn their backs on their own families as he and his own followers did.  They wouldn't hesitate to break up families and leave them destitute as the apostles that had wives and children.  They would shun all gainful employment and any material ownership. 

If you have a problem with this I'd be more than willing to debate you both philosophically or by verse but the later could become problematic. 




 My dog tag says that I'm Buddhist so I just went with it! 




 "Can you make 5 gallons of gravy", we asked the new cook.  He said, "yes!".  He proceeded to blowup our Gaylords!

Seems he decided it was a good idea to add the beef stock straight into the hot shortening............then POOF!  I actually walked in right before he did this but not in time to stop it.  It was like an atomic cloud!   




 CIVILIAN plastic wrap!  Give me a break!  I understand the war mentality that some of you have but you aren't in the military!  

I just wish that people would learn to push in the tabs on the sides of plastic wrap, commercial and residential!    




 First off, congratulations on your promotion!  

Pasta is generally boiled in heavily salted water because it usually contains no salt.  If it's made in-house and salt is already added then you can skip it.  

If I'm blanching vegetables for a crudites platter I will add some salt but not "like the sea".  If I'm doing it to set the color or turgidity and then using the veg in another preparation I won't use any salt.  

I've never heard that salted water affects the absorption rate but even if it did it would be negligible.  

On a side note, there are some vegetables that I will directly put salt on to pull the water out such as thinly sliced cabbage for a wilted but crunchy coleslaw or slices of eggplant before I fry them.  

For the time being do whatever your chef tells you to do.  

In the meantime it may help to study food science in order to understand the "whys" of cooking.  Understanding the basic chemistry involved will help tremendously; from saving a broken Hollandaise sauce, making pancakes without baking powder or preventing the blueberries from turning green.  It will make you an infinitely better chef!  Harold McGee has written several great books on the subject.  

Sounds like you already have good instincts and aren't afraid to question the "wisdom" of so-called chefs.  Just make sure that if you do that you do it respectfully and have the goods to back it up!   




 Yolk color is mostly determined by what the chicken is fed.  Some yolks from other countries can range from almost white to a deep brownish red.  
 




 He won't have a choice.  He'll be in "A" school for about a year and a half. 




 Just WOW!  Glad you had a sense of humor.  My son would have freaked if he woke up and I was in his room much less measuring it! 




 You do realize that I'm a retired female Navy veteran and mother LOL!   




 Thanks for the link.  Never heard of a neckbeard before lol! 




 That would have only been necessary if he'd decided to join the Chair Force. 




 He actually adjusted pretty well.  Both his parents and step-father are Navy veterans so he already knew exactly how to fold his clothes in a proper military manner but you'd never guess that by looking at his room LOL!  




 Thanks for the recommendations.  Looking forward to visiting Chicago! 




 Definitely sweet!  Made with cream cheese and brown sugar.  I'll be doing a trial run tomorrow.  




 Pumpkin wontons instead of pumpkin pie.   




 Going to Chicago for the first time for my son's graduation from bootcamp.  Any suggestions where to go for the best deep-dish pizza other than Uno's?   




 I read the article then read all the comments below then laughed my ass off! 

The comparisons to teamwork in the military and and being able to anticipate and communicate ("behind you!, knife!, hot pan!) in a civi kitchen are spot on.  The military has it's own culture and nomenclature and so does a kitchen.  There is a smooth and rhythmic order to small kitchens that is hard to define along with all the chaotic disruptions that invariably happen. 

  I liken it to a dance and when everyone knows and hears the same notes and all the instruments are ready then beautiful songs happen.  

When you refer to your small station in a kitchen as a battle station, I can relate.   

You see, I'm the real deal.  I was a Navy cook/caterer/chef for Admirals/Generals for 18 years on both ships and aircraft.  I'm also a veteran of several civilian restaurants before, during and after my military career.  

A Battle Station is not much different then a cooking station.  Mine was in a small room called a Battle Dressing Station.  Although my rate was a cook I knew where everything was and was trained to use it.  We always kept it clean and stocked!

As far as being on your feet for 12 hours, try doing it in Combat boots instead of Crocs.

There is nothing in the civilian restaurant world that compares to cooking in a cramped Navy galley.  The Junior Officer that happens to be your clueless Food Service Officer that insists that the fryer be used for french fries for lunch during high speed turns at sea and your just trying best to stay vertical or the CO that expects the galley to feed 250 people in one hour right after battle stations even though all the cooks were at their battle stations and not in the galley!  

Military cooks do it under fire and sometimes we fire back.  Civilians cooks, however, are probably the closest I've seen to military "brothers in arms".  

          




 In San Diego they have some great BBQ joints.  Their meat of choice is not typical of anywhere else.  They use tri-tip along with pork ribs.  Other than that, the area is flooded with Hawaiian BBQ,  




 Were did you imbibe in this carb overload? 









 Where are you from that you haven't had this before?  Grits, greens or chitterlings I can understand but the rest is pretty much standard American fare. 




 This reminds me of my past and makes me sad.  Only thing missing is the liter of Canadian Mist.  It will get better 80sPimpNinja! 




 The chili is spiced with cinnamon and coriander.  

It has a kind of Mediterranean flavor packet.  It has always reminded me of the meat mixture used in Moussaka, a Greek dish layered like lasagna with a  mixture of ground lamb or beef, tomatoes, and seasonings,  eggplant slices and a Bechemel sauce.      




 Chili on rice is very nice!
Rice in Chili is very silly. 




 Texan here and I approve.  Love both kinds! 




 Yes, and yes it can unless you're on the farm or close to a farm. 

 If you're reading or asking this then you can look up why milk came to be pasteurized in the first place but I'm guessing you are either too lazy or are a troll.  

Pasteurization saved millions of lives and disease in the 20th century when refrigeration wasn't widely available.  Good luck with the raw milk or cheese ; )     




 Haven't heard wiz wit in 19 years or more!  Truffle oil they can keep!  Just an excuse to raise the price. 




 PYT, http://pytburger.com/,  in Philly ya'll, or you-in's, or youns or whatever, it's all good!

 




 Had a feeling Reddit would come through!  Thanks!  Almost makes me wish I lived near Philly.  Do you? 




 I made fresh ricotta about two weeks ago and I also 'ultra-pasturized' it!  What a mess LOL!  Good job on the Legzagna as they call it here in the South!  I too par-boil and towel dry my noodles.    




 The best I can do is surmise how to recreate it so here goes.

Make some yeast-raised donut or enriched sweet dough.  Fry until golden and let drain.  Brown some ground beef making sure you break it up into very small pieces.  Add a cheese sauce and whatever other seasoning or ingredients you want.  Let cool slightly.  Using a pastry bag with a long but big enough tip, pipe the mixture into the donut like you would do for a jelly donuts.   Brush top with butter or some sort of glaze, maybe honey mustard and sprinkle with chopped cooked bacon.  

Unfortunately for my cholesterol level, I'll be trying this myself!  




 The only thing I know is it's from some burger joint in Philly.  Maybe someone here knows the exact place. 




 Yes!  Cheese and ground beef. 




 The last pic looked like the eggs exploded into feathers! 




 Reminds me of a recipe I made once,  Tuna Twinkie Souffle! 









 Looks nice!  What's in the ravioli and are they homemade?  




 Seasoning mixes of all kinds.  Taco, Creole/Cajun, Italian, Chinese 5 spice, Garam Marsala and curry powder all come to mind.  Convenient yes but also awful and more often than not, overly loaded with salt and/or sugar.  Even seasoned salt is better made from scratch.  

Some individual ingredients in these mixes are so much better if they are freshly toasted or ground and for some recipes, certain spices should be added at different times in the preparation process.  
    




 When my great-aunt moved into a new apartment she found what she thought was a patch of dill weed growing nearby and made a batch of pickles with it.  

When I came to visit her she proudly asked us to try her new batch.  OMG!  

"What is this!", I said after spitting it out in the trash.  After showing us the patch of 'dill weed' she found we quickly determined it was a type of licorice plant.  

I can honestly confirm that Licorice Pickles will never, ever become a trend.  




 Pumped up for what?  Different songs for different affects lol! 




 Cheese on french fries is pretty common across the States.  There are variations such as Irish Nachos, cheese over thick-cut potato chips or Frito Pie, cheese and chili over Frito corn chips.  Doing the same with gravy, not a variation. 

You couldn't cover tortilla chips in gravy and get away with calling it Nachos.    Poutine; however, is a different dish altogether and a mighty tasty one at that!  

With that said,  what's with the burnt onions?  Yuck! 




 It's a "not so secret, secret menu item".  




 I can almost smell the salty ocean and the fresh catch of the day on the wharf!  




 Now you know! 




 So much chocolate yummieness!  Did you use a chocolate fondant glaze? 




 May just have to make a special trip!  Far West Fort Worth here. 




 Where in Texas you at? 




 Smiling knowingly! 




 I tried this a couple of days ago and Rks1157 is absolutely correct that it needs no other condiments.  I made appetizer portions since I had hard French dinner rolls on hand.  I also added 1 Tbps. each seasonings shown to 1 1/2 lbs of ground beef.  Here's the result:  http://i.imgur.com/sm1PGpn.jpg http://i.imgur.com/sFSUZwa.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/dcotrvo.jpg   




 I've been stationed in San Diego and Philly (Willow Grove) so I've definitely eaten my fair share of authentic cheesesteaks.  The closest authentic cheesesteak I found near San Diego was a place called McGonagle's in National City, CA.  They even have the cheezwiz version if you into that but I prefer provolone.    Owners are originally from Philly and their buns are flown in from Amoroso's bakery in Philly.  As close to Pat's or Geno's as your gonna get.  You should drop by and try one before making it from scratch! 




 My bad.  Correction made. 




 /\ /\ /\

Right above your comment lol! 
 




 That sounds interesting.  Let me know how it turns out.  I would recommend a lighter wine than the Cab I used even with this recipe.  I made it again with a Rose and it was much better and since it had a lighter color I placed some thinly sliced apples on top of the cheesecake in a nice pattern before I added the wine gelee.  




 He was sportin' a Army cap so..... 




 Recipe for cheesecake:

Ingredients

    Nonstick vegetable spray
    1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, divided use
    1/2 pound bacon, cooked, drained, and crumbled (reserve 2 Tablespoons of fat)
    1 onion, diced
    2 apples, peeled, cored, and diced
    2 cloves garlic, minced
    Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
    32 ounces (4 large blocks) cream cheese, at room temperature
    5 eggs
    3 Tablespoons wine vinegar
    1/4 cup whiskey
    12 ounces blue cheese, crumbled
    2 Tablespoons minced chives
    Sliced fresh apples, toast wedges, and/or assorted cocktail crackers

    Prep Time: 20 minutes
    Cook Time: 495 minutes

Preparation

Preheat oven to 200 F. Coat a 9-inch springform pan with vegetable oil spray. Dust with 2 tablespoons of the Parmesan cheese. Set aside.

Saute onion in bacon fat until softened and translucent. Add apples and garlic and continue to saute over medium heat an additional 2 to 3 minutes until apples begin to soften. Remove from heat and season with salt and pepper. Let cool.

Beat the cream cheese in a large bowl until smooth. Add eggs, wine vinegar, and whiskey, beating until smooth. Stir in apple mixture, bacon, blue cheese, remaining Parmesan cheese, and chives by hand.

Pour batter into prepared pan and place in the preheated oven. Let bake overnight for 8 to 9 hours (timing is not critical). It should be fairly firm and slightly browned. Remove from oven and cool on a rack at least 1 hour.

Cover the top of the cooled cheesecake with plastic wrap. Place an inverted plate over the top, turn it over, and remove the pan. Refrigerate the upside-down cheesecake at least 1 hour. Reinvert the cheesecake and remove plastic wrap. Cover and refrigerate 1 hour.

To serve as an appetizer, cut slices with a knife dipped in warm water and garnish with fresh apple slices, toast wedges, and/or cocktail crackers of choice.

Yield: 10 to 12 servings

Recipe for wine gelee:

 To make one 6-inch cheesecake:  Unmold the cheesecake and wrap it in a parchment-paper collar that extends 1 inch above the surface; secure with tape. Pour 1/2 cup of one of the wines into a bowl; if using ros or Pinot Noir, add 1 tablespoon of sugar. Microwave at high power for about 30 seconds, or until the sugar is dissolved. In a small bowl, sprinkle 1 1/2 teaspoons of gelatin over 1 1/2 tablespoons of water and let soften. Heat at high power for 15 seconds, or until the gelatin is melted. Add it to the wine and let stand until slightly thickened but not set, about 10 minutes. Pour the wine gele over the cheesecake and refrigerate for about 1 hour, or until set. Remove the paper collar before serving. 
    



 









 I suppose so.   




 After they were evaluated by our chef we tried one then threw them away.  I'd say they would probably hold for service for 4 to 6 hours in clean water under refrigeration but I'm not sure.  I've heard that the balsamic caviar spheres will last up to a day.  




 Not necessarily.  Main ingredients boil down to yogurt and cucumbers.  Kind of like whether or not Stroganoff should have mustard or if Chili should have tomatoes or beans.  Personal preference. 




 No garlic.  Just yogurt, peeled and pureed cucumbers, dill, mint, salt and pepper to taste.  




 A little less peanut butter and I would eat this.  A Elvis version hot dog! 




 This, I will definitely make.  Thank you!  




 Can confirm.  I cooked thousands of strips of bacon this way as a Navy cook except for the wire rack.  Always came out like this. 




 You are correct!  Not a complete dish.  We were just playing around with MG and our plating techniques at school.  









 Well damn!  Now I've got to get the veal bones to make my next brown stock in order to make a decent French Onion soup in my neck of the woods. Thanks OP!  




 It's just regular Tzatziki mixed with a touch of calcium lactate that is carefully dropped by spoonful into a bath of sodium alginate and carefully swirled around until an ultra-thin membrane develops. 

Science!! Do, do, do, do, do, do, da, do, do da do!  




 Closest thing I could find to a ninjadiscojesus! 




 Some pics of food are not meant to be taken close up lol!  I'm sure it was good though.  I like catsup on scrambled eggs.  This looks more like egg drop tomato soup! 




 More like this.

http://imgur.com/kPpZJtD  




 Flank steak is also referred to here as a London Broil LOL!  It's very lean and requires a cooking method usually involving braising if cooking it whole or cutting very thin strips across the grain with a quick saute as in fajitas. Skirt steak or top round could be a substitute.  

You could use pork belly but it has a lot more fat so I would brown it off first to render some of the fat away and then braise or slow cook it. Good luck and thanks for the laugh!   




 Looks like she has the 'balls' in the family! 
























 Good for you.  Try making enough fries for 265 people within a 1 hour time frame at sea on a Destroyer that is rocking back and forth. 




 If this were presented to me back in culinary school, as in, here is some oranges, make a soup I would have done this.

Segmented one orange into perfect skinless segments.  Set aside.

Juice two oranges and strain.  Add orange juice to equal amounts plain yogurt.  To that add a flavor packet of fresh ground coriander, 1 clove, 1/4 tsp fresh ground nutmeg, 1 tsp tahini  and 1/2 tsp finely ground red pepper flakes. 

Place 3 or 5 segmented oranges in a shallow soup bowl.  Pour the orange mixture (cold or heated) over the segments but don't completely cover.

Garnish with a dollop of creme fraiche and some cilantro leaves.  Sprinkle some Kosher salt over the top.


That's what I'd do.   




 Exactly what kind of eggs OP?
 




 Also no.    This may help.   http://whatscookingamerica.net/Q-A/AlcoholCooking.htm
 




 Some sort of gourmet/healthy sub sandwiches with a side like potato salad or mac and cheese.  Prep and assembly provides work but wouldn't be time intensive and if you made you gourmet ingredients from scratch like a siracha or jalapeno mayo(jar) you could easily do this under $400.  

Or enchiladas.
    




 Those nooks!  Those crannies!  Your family and friends are the lucky recipients of your obvious talent!  Can I be your friend?
 




 I always cook like this when I'm in bed suffering from the Flu too LOL! 




 We are a Constitutional Republic but unfortunately have operated as an economic oligarchy for most of our history and more recently a corporate oligarchy.  To be sure, the average voter is dissatisfied with this arrangement.  Religion plays a peripheral role but an important one because of it's influence on society.   




 I cringed when we had to make these in culinary school!   




 Good job man/woman!  I'll have to try the mustard.  How expensive is that remote temperature gauge?  I so want one!  




 Nice, like a haute version of frito pie! 




 Your question is puzzling.  I didn't say our founders hopes for America were more precious.  I would say that all Americans that fought in subsequent wars, including myself, fought for the same thing.  The US Constitution.  Their willingness to defend it was and is based on the same hope.  




 "pregnancy isn't a death sentence"  Actually it very well can be.  Carrying a pregnancy to term is much more likely to cause maternal death then abortion. 




 Meh.....Everyone knows this. Even lowly Navy cooks, and now you do too. Congratulations, for freaking what?! 




 Hopefully, within the next 40 years, enough for a generation or two to die out, the US will fulfill our founder's hopes and become the Constitutional Republic they envisioned and fought for.  

US Government 101:

The US Constitution is not based on religion.  The US is not a Theocracy.

The US government is not based on direct democracy or the idea of "the majority rules".  Our Constitution specifically spelled out and defended the rights of the minority against the majority if it conflicted with the constitution.  This is evident by the separation of powers within the government that the people elect.

Democracy=theocracy is a non-gratis and makes no sense!  Although I know that many Republicans would love to convince the country that that isn't the case! LOL 




 Can you provide an example of one of your beliefs that is not protected by law but should be?  




 "My original comment demonstrates only the genesis of good and evil, i.e. the answer to the question of why murder is evil. Things are evil because they offend God."

Why would evil offend your god?  He supposedly created everything including evil according to the Bible.   




 Your god, as revealed to you has told you annihilate every man, woman, and child whether born or unborn from a tribe you don't have familiar ties.  What would you do?  




 You said this and I quote,    "Even while the Lord had his people, the jews, there was no actual law or written word until after the time of the Exodus".

The topic was prior religions not just the Bible or Torah.

So, I'll ask again, What are your thoughts about religions and civilizations that predate the Bible and the Koran?

 




 Please explain how a sentient metaphysical god exists and how you can prove it or disprove it?
 




 I'm proposing that there is an innate sense or morality based on empathy that does not require a God.  If you believe your god requires you to do something that runs counter to your empathetic nature then the god truths you believe in may be immoral.    




 What about a sense of empathy?  Empathy has been observed in "higher" species of animals.  Humans tend to gain this sense at a very young age before they can formulate an understanding of morality or ethics.  Empathy is an innate property of what humanity is and some other species are.  It also is the very heart of the "Golden Rule" which most religions will say they are based on even if the end results show that the original meanings where corrupted.   




 What you are suffuring from has nothing to do with your eye color.  It is called Narcissistic personality disorder.  Good luck with your recovery! 




 Are your morals dependant on a God given edict? 




 Do you think that people who have no religion lack morals?
 




 Yea right!  You're a fake and you know this.  I'm sure you love the attention though. 




 That's crazy ignorant LOL! 




 Standard 6 inch hotel pan/insert.  Not sure who makes them but you can find them at any restaurant supply store.  Don't use an aluminum one! 




 Post yourself tonight without any makeup!  Let us judge if you are real or not.  I'm betting that you can't! 




 Try a hard to semi-hard cheese such as gruyere, parmesean, swiss, cheddar, gouda or mozzarella.  You want it to melt but not so much that it disappears.   

Don't buy pregrated cheese.  It's coated with a substance that keeps the individual pieces from sticking together in the bag but inhibits the melting effect.  Buy whole block and grate the cheese you choose with a medium grate. 




 Freakishly oversized eyes and skin that has absolutely no pores whatsover,  seems legit!  Love the kitty though!  




 I think I could make mash potatoes "float" over soup without becoming soggy or dissolve if I melted a fine layer of cheese on top of the soup before I added the tators.  Sort of like putting whipped potatoes over a French Onion soup.  

Hope this helps but regardless it has given me some great new soup ideas, thanks! 




 Let me make sure I understand you correctly.  You are ascertaining that there was no written language, much less any actual written laws from any civilizations before Exodus occurred (sometime after 1500 BCE)?  




 In order to judge the morals of the Bible you must be able to have an innate sense of morality.   




 I've had mine for almost 20 years and even though I use it almost at a commercial level,  I've never had a problem with it!  The culinary school I recently attended said they stopped buying KA mixers because they kept breaking down.  Seems that the company began replacing some of the metal parts with plastic ones.  Make sure she keeps her warranty/receipt!  




 Are you referring to rational thinking people or the more everyday, garden variety of ignorant Christians that can't respond, such as yourself because there is no rational response? 




 How do you reconcile that the first 5 commandments are clearly in violation of the protections that the US Constitution and  Bill of Rights.  




 Yea, I guess I'm a little OCD that way! 




 That one bun with the stripes going the wrong way ruined it!
  




 Sounds like you felt helpless.   




 Looks like something from culinary school.  Microgreens would have been better than chopped parsley.  I bet it tasted good though.
 




 They are almost always free. 




 Why did you post this?  No really, why? 




 Yesss!  Lived in Philly for four years.  The biggest aspect of a great CS is getting the cheese melted throughout the meat.  If you get a CS with a glob of cheese melted on the top they're doing it "wrong". 




 Did you call CPS? 




 Don't assume they can't.  Some people in wheelchairs can stand or walk for short periods of time.  It's nice of you to help if they ask! 




 Go to their website.  If I remember correctly it changes weekly. 




 Ha ha!  Your argument brought to mind the ad I saw for an "enchilada" taco at Jack in the Box! 




 6 to 8 applications of BBQ sauce gave it that dark lacquered look.  




 Sounds....interesting.  Thanks! 




 Not smokey at all.  Just a wonderful scent throughout the house!  We used a Cameron smoker when I ran an officer's mess that was on the sixth floor. They are made to be used on a stove-top.  This is just my homemade version of the smoker.  




 Stuck them in the smoker for 30 min. after I took the ribs out then put them with the ribs on the open sheet pan for 1 hour basting with the BBQ sauce every 15 min. 




 Durkee "Grill Creations",  St Louis Style Smokey Mesquite seasoning. 




 You've got to make sure the foil is wrapped tightly around the pan.  I only gives off a few puffs of smoke but nothing the overhead fan can't handle.  I wouldn't use this indoors for a long smoke like 4+ hours.   




 Many people from the UK think root beer taste like some sort of cough medicine.  Me?  A champagne float with strawberry ice cream,  a juicy beef cheeseburger plus fries. 








  
 




 What is a soferita?
 




 Love it!  I invented a new sandwich when I was 4.  Bread plus an half inch of butter then stuck mini marshmallows into the butter and top with more bread.  My mother was actually brave enough to take a bite!
 









 You need to get a power of attorney concerning their physical health!  




 I was in the military and tried everything I could to get stationed closer to home in order to help my mother whom I suspected was being financially fleeced and neglected.   Why are you protecting your sister who is clearly abusing your parents?  If I can figure out who you are and therefore your parents, which is not real hard, I will report this and also your lack of concern.  This may seem normal TO YOU!  It is not!

 




 Where are your parents?  Do they choose to ignore this? 




 This is why you crack eggs in a separate bowl before using it.  The blood is not menstrual blood, chickens don't menstruate, duh!  It's just a little blood that occurred during the formation of the follicle egg sak.  

Why this is WTF is laughable!  Except some boys reactions!

 




 Chickens lay eggs.  They do not have menstrual cycles and chicks don't lay eggs.  Guess you slept though biology 1 and  basic sexual education LOL!
   




 In my opinion I think it is a combination of circumstances. 

 Many high schools do not spend much time teaching evolution if at all.  HS biology classes are usually not taught by a teacher with a degree in biology.  My own HS biology class was taught by an athletic coach.  

 Many people do actively try to sabotage the teaching of evolution.  Here in Texas the Texas Board of Education uses a citizen review board to recommend changes to textbooks.  Most of these people are not experts and some have explicit agendas such as the dumbing down of evolution or including warning stickers indicating that it's only "a theory".  Because Texas is such a big state and textbook publishing is such a big business, changes can effect the industry nationwide.

 The most devastating element to the teaching of evolution and education in general is the mindless cloning of textbook material by large corporate publishers who rely on the endless, thoughtless coping from texts going back decades and not bothering to update new scientific ideas and evidence. Laziness or sloth for profit is still a sin last time I checked!
    




 LOL!  You're delusional and not even somewhat credible.  The best you could do for humanity is to not procreate!  




 I love this! Can I use this? 




 Mike, were your parents and society you grew up in the same religion you practice? 




 Meh!   




 Maybe but it's still a coinsidence ; )
 









 Did you take your kids with you? 




 This made me smile. Thanks OP! 




 Not vagina.  Labia Major on the outside;  Vagina is not visible from the outside kiddo.  




 Their in-house made pickles are also wonderful.  My favorite is the chorizo-infuzed  Caca Oaxaca burger.  Chef Grober really rose to the occasion when he took on the challenge of creating the best burger in Fort Worth 2013 within shouting distance of Fred's, a Fort Worth all-star whole-in-the-wall burger joint since 1978!  Good things to come! 




 I used to dip my french fries into my chocolate milkshake when I was a kid.  I imagine the taste to be almost as good.  I'd probably dip each chip in real whipped cream for the full effect! 














 cute! 




 Sorry! 




 I'm guessing that your late wife didn't like a medium steak or yams?  Good on ya though.  Press on! 




 The best recipe you can use is the stovetop recipe from 'The Best Recipe' book which are collections of kitchen tested recipes from the 'Cook Illustrated' magazine. I've made this recipe many, many times for small and large groups and it always comes out perfect with a silky smooth finish. The secret is using evaporated milk which stabilizes the cheese sauce and you don't have to keep it cold till you need it. Don't forget the can opener though!

If you only have one camp stove and stock pot you'll need to make a slight modification but it shouldn't be a problem. You'll just need a small butane blow torch. The first amounts are for 6 side portions or 4 main dish and the second for 48 side or 32 main.

Mac   Cheese

Topping (opt) 1 1/2/4 cups dry bread crumbs pinch/1 tsp salt 1 1/2 /4 Tbps softened butter

Mac and Cheese

2 / 16 large eggs 1 / 8 (12oz) can evaporated milk 1/4 / 2 tsp hot red pepper sauce 2 tsp / 5Tbps,1/4 tsp salt 1/4 / 2 tsp ground black pepper 1 / 8 tsp dry mustard, dissolved in 1 / 8 tsp water to activate. 8 oz / 4 lb dry elbow or shell pasta 4 Tbps / 2 cups unsalted butter 12 oz / 6 lbs grated cheese, I use 1 part sharp cheddar, 1 part swiss, 1 part fontina and 1 part velveeta

For Mac   Cheese 1. Mix eggs, 1 cup / 8 cups evaporated milk, pepper sauce, 1/2 / 4 tsp salt, pepper and mustard mixture together in a bowl and set aside.

    Bring 2 qts or enough for 4 lbs pasta to a boil in the stock pot. Add remaining salt and pasta. Cook until almost tender but still firm to the bite. Drain, retaining some of the pasta water, and return to pan over low heat, Add butter and toss to melt.

    Pour egg mixture over buttered pasta along with three-quarters of the cheese; stir until thoroughly combined and cheese start to melt. Gradually add remaining milk and cheese, stirring constantly, until mixture is hot and creamy, about 5 minutes. Make sure the utensil you use to stir is long enough to reach the bottom and preferably has a flat end.

    Pour Mac   Cheese into serving containers.

For the topping;

    Mix the bread crumbs with the salt.

    With a gloved hand. Mix the softened butter with the bread crumbs. Sprinkle crumbs over Mac   Cheese.

    Using a butane torch, carefully brown the top.

Love the Mac   Cheese bar idea! Happy Camping! 









 Cafe du Monde is over-hyped.  Spent seven years driving past the place every morning.  The few times I stopped there, their beignets were half cooked, greasy and overloaded with sugar.  Coffee was just OK.  Tourist trap. 

 Want a good breakfast?  Drive a little farther to Elizabeth's on Chartres at Gallier St.  Looks like a hole in the wall but it's the best and where the locals go!  




 Sort of like a scotch jalapeno, nice! 




 You must be in Texas! LOL 




 I originally posted the pics at r/military.  I posted this to r/neckbeards at their urging.

Most of the comments I've read were positive.  The few that were negative mostly took pock-shots at my calling my son out.  Sorry but believe it or not, every parent of a NB or almost a NB should shame their NB.  Being a NB is not something to aspire to!  

Having to ask my adult son to make sure his door to his room was closed when I had company come over didn't make me love him less and he always knew that I was trying to impart a sense of cleanliness when I made him clean his room once every 3 months.  

For all off the NB's out there, you should feel good that he won't suffer your fate LOL!  

I just know that the military will instill that into him and all the negative NB's can kiss my ass!     




 I don't believe that I'm responsible for grown men that have made bad decisions even just because we are related.   




 OIC, sort of like purple in a purple drink lol!
 




 Whataburger=Hallelujah 




 Amen! 




 Did you brine?  Looks delicious!

I only just now looked at Alton Brown's recipe.  All that typing for nothing lol.
At least 'Best Recipe' gives credit to John Thorne who published it first! 




 Since dubliner is nutty and somewhat salty it pairs well with fruits like apples or pears, chicken/turkey/honey ham and most mustards.  Stay away from things that are already salty like most bacon and pickles.  A good sourdough or country bread would be good.   




 What is "brown" vs ketchup? 




 Shells are so much better than elbow macaroni.  Each shell becomes a tiny bowl filled with cheese sauce and traps little bits of yumminess!  Looks yummy OP!   




 Yes, thanks. 




 What can I say, atc_guy is right.  Hot chicks join the air force for a different reason and it has everything to do with the fact that the these prima donnas aren't cut from the same cloth that the other branches make of.  
  




 Even when I was religious I'd tell people that God helps those that (try to) help themselves.  That being said, you first need to lose your defeatist inner talk.  Everyone has set-backs in their life.  I doubt everything in yours was bad.  

You obviously know how to use a computer.  My homeless uncle and brother never bothered to learn and it's crippling them plus they are felons.  Are you a felon?  If not then be proud and thankful.  

When you put your kids to bed tonight look straight into each one of their eyes and try to imagine the strong loving person they see.  Then, before you go to bed, look back at yourself in the mirror and realize that you ARE the strong, confident and loving parent that they see and you ARE even if you don't believe it!    

Keep in touch Woman! 




 Are they willing to give you a letter of recommendation?  Please ask for it  




 Your name tells all.  Try walking into a church after hours.  Locked and bolted!   




 If the condition of my son's room does not cross the border into your definition of neckbeardism, as in a room that is not a normal livable space then I sincerely feel sorry for the girl you've shacked up with.  But maybe she's a slob and it doesn't matter!  She obviously doesn't care about giving away free milk!  But hey, good on your end right! 




 Sounds like you have unresolved father-son issues and that is sad for you.  I will call a spade a spade and when my son lives like a neckbeard then I will call him a neckbeard.  We have both laughed about it and the Navy has cleaned up his act.  Too many parents won't actually parent-up and tell their 17 year old brat that they need to grow up.  I wish you luck in your nest that you share with Mommy and Daddy.    




 I sent the before and after pictures to my son and even he approved and laughed.  He is a great guy and I am so proud of him.  When YOU survive bootcamp let me know and then I will give your opinion but until then STFU! because you have presented your self as ignorant and stupid.      




 Your aunt did a good thing and I'm sorry to hear it didn't work out.  Unfortunately it seems to be case more often then not.   




 I didn't cut them off.  They can always depend on me to emotionally support them.  I refuse to support them financially and even found a half-way house that I had to drag my uncle into.    




 This is best response I've received.  Thank you!  I wish my grandmother and mom, plus the absent fathers had taught them to be self reliant but they didn't or couldn't.  What I'm grappling with is what to do if they reject rehab, a roof over their head plus meals.  I'm not going to turn my back but I won't let them rely on me either!     




 I want to thank you for pointing out ways that I may have made it it seem that my son wasn't a neckbeard.  He had trouble even growing a mustache!

I'm not putting my son down and he would be the first to confirm that, however you seem to be putting yourself down and that is sad! 









 Yes, except for New Orleans but most of them sound like they're from New York anyway. 




 roadside stands selling boiled peanuts. 
























 I'll do that, thanks.  I've heard that John has a reputation for not playing well with others.  Wish him luck in South Cacalaca!
 









 The Oasis has a spectacular view way above Lake Travis with multi-level patio dining tucked into the hillside.  Usually I'd be wary of any Q place with La as part of its name lol but I'll check it out.  




 When I think of Britain and beans somehow this comes to mind...
https://youtu.be/ChGxwRq3YcI
 




 OP, before we go and pay that much for a can of beans in tomato sauce please let us know if they are any different that what we get here.    




 The Greistmill in Gruene and The Oasis in Austin have great food and the most beautiful outdoor dining views!  Franklin's is great for BBQ but THE WAIT! 




 I expected at least some spinach. As a sailor, I nonetheless approve! 




 Oh yes!  Very nice! 




 See comment above.  As far the best here?  That's hard to pin down.  90% of the 4,000 or so members of the Texas Restaurant Association serve CFS.  In Fort Worth I like Lucille's,  Babe's Chicken House or Vickery Cafe.   




 It's no big secret how to make your own.  Take cubed steak and pound the shit out of it till it looks like it wrestled with a waffle iron and lost.  

Season 2 cups of flour with the seasoning of your choice.  I like "Slap Yo Momma".  In a second container mix 1 1/2 cups buttermilk, 2 Tsp baking powder, 1 Tsp baking soda and 1 egg, garlic and hot sauce.  Coat in flour,  then dredge in the buttermilk mixture and place back into the flour.
  
Very Important...when you coat it the second time make sure you thoroughly pat the flour into the steak until it feels dry.  Place your steaks on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper and dusted with flour.  Refrigerate up to an hour until you're ready to fry em up.  This step is not necessary but I feel it makes a crispier crust and gives you time to clean.  Fry at 325F in 1/2 inch oil about for 6 to 8 minutes on each side.

Use 2 Tbsp of the leftover oil and pan drippings to make a cream gravy.  

You've done it all right if you don't need a knife to cut it or teeth to chew it for that matter!      




 LOL, ya got me there! 




 Funny because it was made by a Texan at my house in Texas?
 




 IDC Burgers.  Shell station in Aledo, TX outside of Fort Worth. 




 IDC Burgers @ a Shell station in Aledo, TX 









 I would love that!  Over a plate of CFS of course.  




 Thank you.  It's unfortunate that what the order did and does is true.  I would truly hope that the Catholic Church cared about the most vulnerable of the people in your country but they unwaveringly care only about money and power.  Nameste. 




 LOL! Burleson as in Brig. Gen. Edward Burleson, who led a regiment at San Jacinto, was the Vice President under the Republic of Texas and my forth great grand-father.  

No matter,  I'm in far SW Fort Worth.  Drop me a line and I'll tell you all my secrets.    




 True, every once in awhile! 




 In Texas.  At my house.   If I like you! 









 Did something similar with a cheesecake.

http://imgur.com/mlCq1zG 









 Yes,  It's an emulsified butter sauce and Escoffier named it as a mother sauce,  at 5 parts butter to egg yolk hollandaise sauce should be called heart attack sauce.  









 Lower your heat, season your flour, use a deeper pan with oil at least 1/2 in. deep.  Try, try again and good luck! 




 She had a fetish for dying people; sort of a belief that pain and suffering were gifts from God.  Almost none of the millions of dollars she received went to help the dying people her and her order professed to help.  Her order would reuse old needles and withhold basic pain relief.  Also she associated with some questionable people.  Not only did they not treat or comfort the "dying" in her care but many people died who would have lived if they received basic care.  Of course, when she became ill she received the best care available. 




 Mother Teresa 




 Actually it's being very honest.  If I described guacamole then I'd be dishonest.  Your feedback is nonetheless ignored as being irrelevant.  




 These are delicious and so easy to make.  Just rub wings with a packet of taco seasoning and bake and then toss them in your favorite taco sauce! 









 Nice job!  I see The Shed is bottling their sauce.  Great little place.  Glad they rebuilt after burning down.  




 Absolutely!  First thing I noticed. 




 Your chef is wrong.  That's the last thing you should do! 




 True.  I wear my calluses and certain scars with pride.  If you apply for a position the first thing I'll check is you hands!   




 When I was 8 my mother said it looked like brains from a car wreck served on a plate.  Didn't phase me a bit. She didn't like pizza either. 




 Hope that list doesn't include a hot dog cause...

 Ketchup over eggs has been debated in my family for ever.   









 To add to that chicken fried steak is sometimes served at breakfast along with eggs and potatoes. 




 Of course!  because what you call chips are fries and what you call crisps are chips lol! 




 Corn and tomatoes.  You're welcome. 




 I saw a guy do the same thing.  He was a drilling reservist and came in all hungover.  While making eggs on the flat-top he just placed his hand palm down on it to steady himself. He did even realize it until a cook knocked his hand off!    




 I was boiling pasta in a tilting 80 gallon steam jacket kettle during a busy drill weekend.  While I was holding a large colander another cook tilted the kettle forward to drain.  He cranked that sucker too fast and boiling water poured all over my left hand.  I put a latex glove on my hand, filled it with ice water and tied it off with a rubber band and kept cooking only stopping occasionally to drain and refill when the water warmed up.  My skin stayed red for a couple of days but never blistered.   




 Or, conversely, you make real hollandaise and they say it doesn't taste right because the only hollandaise they've had came from a packet.  




 There was/is a popular restaurant in New Orleans that served THE BEST burgers until they were shut down and it wasn't because of Katrina.  They filled a 2' pickle barrel with frozen beef patties and set it on the floor next to the grill uncovered, taking them out as the orders came in.  They'd refill it at night without cleaning it out and store it in the refer till the next day.  No telling how long this went on but FIFO definitely wasn't a term they ever heard because when they were shut down the bottom of the pickle barrel was alive with maggots.       




 Well this Navy cook never saw anything like this: shore or ship.  For slow mornings we'd crack maybe 4 lugs of eggs (120) but for drill weekends or at sea we used 15 lbs tubs of pasteurized frozen eggs.    




 That sounds like my grandmother-in-law.  She wasn't exactly a hoarder as she kept her house clean but she would wash and reuse the Styrofoam trays that was used for meat from the grocery store.   




 In the Navy we were supposed to thaw meat in a refrigerator but that was almost always impossible so we followed the "emergency shipboard thawing procedures".  This meant you could place cases of various meats in their original packaging, place on sheet pans and leave out at room temperature for a determinate time.         




 All fats will go rancid even vegetable oils given enough time.  However, my great aunt would keep leftover bacon/sausage grease in a coffee can (covered of course) on the kitchen counter and would use it to saute and flavor vegetables etc.  




 A caddilac is a term used for a "fancy" mop bucket that has an attachment where the mop can be wrung out. 




 It's funny that cracked pepper was not listed in the description for this dish. 




 No, do not let the root ball dry out.  Water a ficus or Fiddle Leaf regularly but don't let it sit in its waste water.  If the root ball has completely dried out and the plant is small enough, submerge it in plain water until saturated then let drain completely   




 Your Dracaena Marginata is not happy! Marginata's need water but not a lot and do not let them dry out.   Good news!  It's perfectly normal for a DM to loose its lower leaves as it grows.  If it's a matter of too little watering you will see brown dead leaves scattered all over.  The brown tips you see are usually caused by salt damage.  This can happen a number of ways but it can be prevented by watering the DM enough so that water drains out  the bottom and flushes the salts out.  If you let this plant sit in its own water runoff especially its own "waste" then it will uptake the salt and will burn the ends.  Letting it sit in water for any length of time will also lead to stem and fungal rot.   Make sure all the soil is saturated when water when you do water.  Sometimes a rootball will dry up to the point that water doesn't penetrate and just leaks around it so use your best judgement.  Marginatas need water and don't like to ever dry out but they also cannot stand to be left in standing water.   So it looks like this guy need to be repotted because I'm seeing some roots and the pot is too small for the plant.  Choose a pot that is no more than 2 inches bigger than the original and had drainage.  Don't fertilize.  After transplanting use a weak solution of root starter.  Again, don't freak out if it loses for leaves.  At this point you want to grow roots, not leaves.  BTW,  just cut off the ends of the leaves at an angle.  Good luck! 




 In a pinch for just a few portions it's not that bad but if you fry a lot it can add to much fat to the fryer and all that salt will cause the oil to go bad quickly.  




 My friend worked at a popular cheesesteak place outside of Philly that delivered to the local military base.  Was told to make tuna salad in the caddilac because nothing else was available.  Quit and walked out. 




 Classic.  Did you go ahead and make it from scratch? 




 From what I've heard from industry people, your delicious breadsticks are recycled from each and every table that didn't eat all the bread.  Yum, especially if they happened to sneeze all over them!  




 Considering salmonella is/may be present on the outside of the egg shell I find this disgusting and as an 18 year veteran I've never heard of this.  Most military and government installations including ships buy 20 lbs tubs of pasteurized eggs for scrambled and omelets.

Please stop this!      




 A clarification.  I mean more a process like heating up veggies in the water on a steam table or mixing tuna salad in a mop bucket.  




 While on shore duty I had a cook add pancake syrup to cooked carrots instead of following the recipe... butter, ginger and honey.  He said that's what they did on the ship.  That didn't sail on my watch!   




 That's a square meal!
 




 What do you do with your steaks?  




 My godfather designed the Mexican Hat ride.  That fact never got me any free tickets! 




 Jim Bowie and his brother John were slave smugglers/traders/owners. 




 The Cherokee, with whom he lived with for a short while, called him "The Big Drunk". 




 Yes! 




 Sounds like you're doing somethings right;  simmering water that slowly releases bubbles if at all, more like a bloop, bloop (not boiling, added vinegar, cooking 3 1/2 to 4 minutes.  Are you using a very deep pot?  12 inches or more?  Break each egg into individual cups and add one at a time as close to the waterline as possible while gently stirring in a circler motion around the egg.  Keep swirling around slowly.  JS! 




 And this has anything to do with poached eggs? 




 Good on you! 




 Get a dish job at a place that's busy but notorious for cooks not showing up and you'll rise to stardom. 




 Although I understand your frustration it's wrong for you to label your fry guy as incompetent if he's actually a dishwasher.  The one who is incompetent is your manager.  Take it up with him if you have a pair.  
Manning a fryer may seem easy to you but depending on the product it can be daunting.  At least he's trying and you should recognize that and possibly help or encourage him instead of calling him a moron.  

Think about that on your next smoke break! 




 LOL, I'd write out this and similar sentiments when I'd season the grill when I was a cook in the Navy!  Had to waste about 2 dozen eggs anyway.  I'd also write EAT ME or worse on the sheet cakes as a baker.  No harm and no knew but me and the FSA's. 




 "Royal" Engineers LOL!  Perhaps your "royal" rats in the UK are so full of crap that it makes sense not to eat them.  Considering your sewage system I would agree that you shouldn't eat UK gutter rats and mice. 




 You're from PA? 




 Smother those eggs in ketsup till it looks like a train wreck! Yum! 




 Your friends are right but you aren't.  You weren't even ever in a any military position.  So Piss Off Pussy!  




 Rats and mice are most certainly considered food sources. You're so full of shit! You obviously aren't military much less gone through survival training.  Step off!  




 Thank you OP!  I have diverticulosis which means I can't have seeds, corn or nuts and the one thing I miss is a Snicker's bar.  It was my favorite and now I can make my own nutless version. 




 Nothing is straightforward when it comes to the predictability of the menstrual cycle.  You can ovulate while on your period and get pregnant.  Your teacher is obviously ignorant and misinformed and should not be teaching sexual education to minors! 




 During a sex ed class in Navy Bootcamp a recruit asked if he could get AIDS from breastmilk. This was in 1993 BTW.  He also stated that it would be impossible for him to stop having sex once he started even if she told him to stop and that it would not be considered rape. 




 I would not say that you're more likely to get pregnant during your period but it IS possible.  The second statement may depend on what type of birth control you use.  The bottom line is that menstruation does not make it impossible to conceive and it certainly doesn't prevent you from getting an STD.     









 Cream of 'insert here' soup was a Capitalistic plot by Campbell's Soup Company to promote their product plus really bad recipe books following WWII which, because of convenience for the average housewife, led to a decrease in cooking skills.  

 This lead to the eventual low standards of the American palate that grew up to believe that condensed tomato soup from a can was normal and Hmm, Hmm good!  

 Eventually no one knew how to make a sauce, roux or soup  without Campbell's condensed soup.  Except for people in New Orleans and surrounding areas.

 They seemed to have been influenced by Communists to resist the Capitalists influence of convenience foods and instead what they had growing in their backyard or local market.  This is well documented by the Warren Report that outlined the Communist presence and their influence on Lee Harvey Oswald but I digress.

 An entire generation was born and raised not knowing how to cook and their only crutch continued to be Campbell's soup and even crappier cookbooks in the 60's complete with jello molds (but that's another story).  Things would change in the 70's though!

 As early as 1931 the first edition of "The Joy of Cooking" was published but was mostly ignored by home cooks.  After it's 6th edition in 1975 its popularity suddenly exploded and sales sky-rocketed.  This seemed to beat all logic but a book published a little earlier explains why.

  In 1972, A book titled "The Joy of Sex" was published that proved enormously popular even though it had illustrations of hairy hippies.  I have to say at this point that that those illustrations were my first visualizations of sex.  I really couldn't actually describe what I thought sex was at that age but the JOS made it perfectly plain and more important that it sex was not scary, but I digress again.  Sorry.

  It's my theory that the "Joy of Cooking" became popular after the "Joy of Sex" was published because if the JOS worked for you then the FOC would too.  Makes perfect sense.  Sex then food!

Please don't get me started about how Spam ruined Hawaiian cuisine!   




 How witty.  Not to good at taking some criticism are ya? 




 Exactly.  Still makes a brick.  Maybe something like this.

 Hotdish, a type of casserole usually brought to a church potluck or family reunion.  Not to be confused with Funeral Potatoes which are starch based and brought to the deceased's home.    




 That's not a ham hock.  Hocks come from the ankles of a pig.  That looks like what was left over from a bone-in spiral ham.  I'm sure it tasted good regardless.  

I myself like to add pickled pork for the texture difference along with andouille plus a touch of thyme.  Unfortunately I can't find picked pork here in Texas.  

"Laissez les bons temps rouler!" 




 Stacking ham slices that thick is disgusting aesthetically and to the palette.   Might as well bite into a brick of ham.  This could be made so much better using very thin or shaved ham and folded rather than stacked.   
 




 I may have some buyers for your sausage here in Fort Worth.  If you're interested contact me at tulips_1795@yahoo.com.  




 JoJo fries are the best!   




 That grinder is awesome!  You must do this often.  Live anywhere in or near Texas?
 




 The photo is out of focus, 




 Don't waste your money on this gimmick.  The knockoff recipe using Bisquick is as good if not better and cheaper. 




 They were for the mash later on.  My Mom always made a relish tray to nibble on while the rest of the dinner was being prepared. 




 Yes, yes you can! 




 This reminds me of my bowels in a good day! 




 Make some TexMex wontons.  Even better, use it in enchiladas along with mild cheddar or use it in chicken quesidillas. 
 









 There's no n00b on the inside. 




 Well I don't know about Sydney but here in the US the homeless usually eat either discarded food in dumpsters or nothing at all unless they suffer the indignities of "homeless shelters" that by their very rules prevent anyone who's homeless from getting and keeping a job.
 




 What's your point in posting this?  I've had worse serving in the military.  What's your angle? 




 I guess you've never encountered Lady Parts! 




 If you're a gal then that's kinda sad.  If you're a guy, I'm so sorry for you. LOL!
 




 I'd eat it! 














 Don't hold your breath waiting for a coherent answer from a Christian LOL!
 




 You conveniently forgot to explain the rest of the compound word.  "Potent" or powerful.  Omnivore has a much different meaning than omnipotent or even omniscient.  

Your comparison is false.  The paradox still stands. 




 I wish our politics were somehow based on cuisine because, I mean, I love you man! 
























 Start with the name,  "Jamb"=jambon or ham, sausage, tasso but can be chicken, seafood etc.; "ala"= a la, with or everything; "Ya"=African for rice.  
Start with the holy trinity, add seasonings, protein of choice, rice, then tomatoes and stock. Cook until rice is al dente.  The dish is usually heavily seasoned depending on the protein.  It should be somewhat "wet" like a rice casserole so that it sticks together instead of "dry" like a rice pilaf.     









 While there's no hard and fast rule, Jambalayas usually have tomatoes, tomato sauce or both.  With the addition of black-eyed peas your dish looks more like a dressed up version of Hopping John's.  Not that that's a bad thing but it's not what I consider cajun Jambalaya to be.  Note: Spent 10 years cooking in New Orleans.  




 I'm sure you couldn't after some relative of yours cooked their ass off! 




 Are you trying to quit?

 Breakfast in Britain must hazz those beans! 




 I have more faith that the plates are clean then tableclothes that were stored in closets or on shelves even in 5 star restaurants.   Go ahead though and make money with this gimmick to naive diners.  The next best thing will be serving the meal directly on the floor (granite or cedar of course) for artistic affect with only pillows to prop the diners up.  Mark my words!    




 Thanks, it's been a long time since I've done it.  Maybe I'll take it up again. 




 I don't meet to many people that are truly in this.  I took up hand axe throwing and blowguns in '84. 




 Or freeze them if you don't use them right away. 




 Eating off of the table may appeal to the inner child but I find the growing practice disgusting.  Plates can be sanitized but tables can't be run through a 185F dishwasher.  Nasty! 




 Tommy?! 




 Foam, I get it, in small amounts but this looks like a rabid dog drooled all over an otherwise lovely looking dish. 




 What grocery store do you work in? 




 Heinz 75 beans, made famous by Ann Margaret! 




 Who in the world would buy 2 boiled and peeled eggs for $1.99? 




 Almost every dry goods in my panty has a woohoo discount sticker on it!  Grocery prices are just too damn high!  




 They're called Ralph's in CA 




 Jim Bowie, of Alamo fame, was a slave runner/owner. 




 Most people know this lol! 




 Faith, by definition, excludes reason. 




 Yes, that is correct. 




 Yea, sorry about the Americans ruining your pizza business and turning the dish into several successful corporate businesses.  "Excuse Me!"  said the enterprising Italian/Americans!     




 If science could prove evolution beyond a shadow of a doubt would you still believe Biblical teachings over what science shows as truth?
 




 Should be "super stringy cheese mac".  This is why I never put mozz in my mac and cheese.  On another note,  "free range chicken broth"?  Made me imagine bowls of chicken broth hopping around a soup coup. 




 I went to a grocery store in San Diego to purchase a money order.  When I got home I realized I had $100 too much and the clerk must have messed up the transaction so my husband and I went back and told the clerk.  He called his supervisor and they counted down the register but no discrepancies showed up.  We went on to shop in the store and as we were about to check out the clerk ran up to us and said they finally found the discrepancy and his manager had offered us 2 free deli sandwiches for the $$$.  I could have messed with this young man but I gave him the $100.00 back knowing that if I made a mistake like that it would have been a god-send for a customer to return a $100.00 mistake except that it wasn't a god-send since I'm an Atheist and have empathy for someone in that position.  




 Okay, this one I did all by myself.  At my first duty station I made some pie dough using the Armed Forces Recipe Cards.  It listed every ingredient on the front except for water.  I made what I thought looked like a perfect pie dough for 300 portions of Cobbler.  Refrigerated it before rolling it out, it then rolled out beautifully with no cracks and baked off to a perfect golden brown.  I didn't discover how important a little bit of water was until they tried to cut up the pie and the crust instantly turned to dust!   




 Oh please elaborate! 




 On a destroyer I was stationed on we had 4 five gallon buckets of used fryer oil stored on the deck in the galley that was all of about 150 sq ft.  We were expecting high-speed maneuvers that day and secured everything we possibly could however, no one thought to check that the lids were tight and the buckets could not move around.  All four buckets spilled at the same time.  Since this was a ship we first had to stop as much of the oil from going down the drain and scoop up as much oil as possible all the while the ship was still in maneuvers, left then right at angles of about 30 degrees.  This happened right after securing for lunch.  Took about four hours to finally clean up the mess and we still managed to prepare dinner in time.  Everyones fault because no one checked.  Wish someone had been able to make a video!

 Yes, it was a version that a young couple brought to Austin in 1972 to people that never heard of a muffuletta.  The big difference is the bread and olive tapenade. 

I worked at a Schlotsky's in Jr High School in 1981 when it was all about the sandwich.  The bread was delivered in the mornings fully baked so the recipe was kept secret.  
Schlotsky's bread is what sets it apart from a Muff. and I should know since I lived there for nine years.  Muffs use a round Italian.  Schlotz uses a recipe that combines a Sourdough starter with a  English muffin type bread and they are very protective of the recipe! 




 Seriously, don't repost from Yahoo food ever again. 




 A thing of gastronemic beauty created you have. 




 Just puttin' it out there.  A lot of people are put off when they find out their sushi chef is Mexican/Latino.  They think it's because they'll work for less $$$ but they're wrong.  Gotta support my peeps!
   




 Reminds me too much of my food and wine pairing class, sans the wine. 




 This has to be in Texas! 




  There's a historical explanation for this.  The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 effectively stopped all immigration from China to the US and many Chinese who were already here were not allowed to return if they left the US who still had family here.  
 This caused many Chinese to immigrate to Mexico where many opened restaurants or became street vendors.  In the meantime, the Chinese practically invented human smuggling to the US.  
 Consequently the Mexicans, particularly along the border have developed a particularly refined palate for Chinese/Asian food.  Most of the best Chinese/Japanese restaurants in Texas employ a Chef Martinez or Chef Rodriquez as head chef.   




 If you've been scarred by this thread then you are what we'd call a pansy, pussy,  




 Her nails,  I have felt your pain!  What gyno  patient wants to have a pelvic exam with a doctor that has 1 inch nails.   




 You can plan but sometimes things come up that you have absolutely no control over.  For instance a piss test in the military while you're heavily menstruating.  You can't say no and you have to pee into a cup and if you use a pad instead of tampons then you try to pee without any blood getting into the sample because you have to hold your sample over your shoulder in front of every other person until you submit it.     




 Not being taken seriously by doctors who will tell you your problem is "all in your head".

 I've never understood a snood or paper hats for that matter.  Facial and body hair, be it from a beard (long or short), neck, eyebrows, eyelashes or the forearms all shed at the same rate.  To be completely safe from hair you'd have to wear a net completely over the head and gloves up to the elbows! 




 Try putting the oatmeal (steal cut) plus all other ingredients and seasonings you want in a crock pot overnight on low.  You'll wake up to a lovely aroma and a sweet treat!  




 I like the concept.  Think I'll try one with crab, bacon and avocado with a shmear of mayo on homemade bread. 




 This looks great but crosses the bounds into the realm of casserole instead of mac   cheese.    




 No, it's Rudy's.  I plan to get to Heim's as early as possible.  Can't wait to try their pork belly burnt ends!  




 I would almost commit a crime to get a meal of "free" prison food that looked like that! 




 You can also just use a thick-cut raw onion ring or bell pepper. 




 I concur.  Also the perfect ratio of mush and herb to pastry.  Well done my friend! 




 All of the people in this picture appear to be happy.  "nough said".  What is interesting is which ones are deemed, "gross, disgusting or doable" in the comments.

 I did my Externship with what I thought was a place that could teach me the in's and out's of running a restaurant.

 3 extra plates = a 50 cent per extra plate charge. 




 When guys say that what they really mean is they believe women can't handle the pressure of being a professional in the industry.
  
To them their mother probably made the best whatever.  With a few exceptions, no one could make it like she could.  Mom was always depicted at being able to cook the perfect Thanksgiving turkey with all the sides plus desserts for 20 family members and look good while doing it in heals! Plus FOH duties which included the table settings and seasonal decor.  Women were perfectly suited to cook in the home for family and manage organizational stress but never in the Big Ole' Capitalist Marketplace.

We're just delicate flowers that need squashi....'er protection.  News Flash...--.--..Women are as capable as men in working under pressure either in Food Service or as US Navy Combat fighters.

 It's a perception thing that screws women out of a fair wage.  Women can be wonderful cooks and great organizers but not when it comes to being a professional because only men are perceived that can do that. 




 Hope she turned out okay.  Sad what you have to do when you're desperate. 




 Soooo did you?

 I could buy 4 McDoubles a day for a week which = $4.76x7=$22.67.  Plus a bag of 5 lb potatoes at .69 per lb = $3.45 and vegetable oil for frying.  Cumulative total = $26.12. 

Most poor people live in areas that have no accessible to grocers that have fresh fruits and vegetables.  I want to give them  access.  I'm serious!  A Fresh Food Truck!    









 Well done!  I wanted to ask for some of my money back in tuition when my chef/instructor admonished me in front of a guest that a small tasting plate I presented as a Croque Monsieur with a wine pairing was actually a Croque Madame (because it was smaller) even though there was no fried/poached egg!  Now you need to make a Hot Kentucky Brown!

 My mother's divorce from her second husband.  All of a sudden it was Mom, myself and my little brother.  I was 12 and I became  responsible for my 9 year old brother after school.  I also had do start dinner and do the laundry and whatever cleaning needed to be done before my Mom came home or else we were berated or worse, simply ignored. 









 Exactly,  If Jesus was God then he can't be killed.  Only changed back into his original form which was not a sacrifice for God and himself.  Considering the amount of suffering and death of ordinary humans, Jesus ranks really low. 




 While I like the passage you refer to it does not reflect a true sacrifice.  Much like the Peter Pan story, everyone must give up their childhood in order to become an adult.  What Jesus was saying here was not to love your earthly existence but to instead look forward to an everlasting life with God.  If that is the case then there was no sacrifice since the inevitable outcome was to become something greater.  A true sacrifice means a loss without compensation and that never happened with the Crucifixion of Jesus.  




 I was an Admiral's cook at a Flag Mess.  Worked many parties at his quarters.  When the parties started to wind down his wife, who herself held a high level civilian position in DC,  would come back into the kitchen, tell me to grab a "drink" and we would go out back to talk, smoke and commiserate.  She hated most of the O wives.  Most down to earth woman I've ever met.

 Cabbage wedges, carrots and Dutch baby yellow potatoes were oven roasted with a mixture of 6 Tbls butter, 1 cup minced scallions, 2/3 cup creamed horseradish, salt and pepper.  

Corned beef cooked as usual with spice packet+2 tsp black peppercorns and 6 whole clove.  

Glazed with Jezebel Sauce:  1 cup orange marmalade, 2/3 cup apple jelly, 1/4 cup creamed horseradish, 5 Tbls Creole mustard and 1 tsp course ground black pepper.  Makes about 2 cups.  Leftover sauce is great with pork chops or ham or spooned over slightly melted cream cheese as a dip.

 An American black female who was in my command when I was in the Navy jumped all over her white, blonde-haired, blue-eyed, male shipmate when he casually mentioned he was an African-American.  She couldn't grasp the difference between country of origin/nationality vs race.  She also went so far as to prevent another shipmate from listening to a radio program that she found offensive when she happened to drop by his work station.  Seems she didn't like it hearing Louis Farrahkan referred to as "Calypso Louie" by the black radio host, Ken Hamblin and no, she was not Muslim.  So much for protecting the Constitution and the rights of free speech!

 Thanks.  I think you're right.  Might have to change pharmacies though since my pain meds are pretty strong and they may give me hassles.    




 The prescription was for an opioid pain patch.  I used it for 1 week before I realized it was 7 months past its expiration date.  I don't think I suffered any ill affects and they, happily and apologetically replace the medication.  I'm not looking for a lawsuit/money but I'm concerned because this chain pharmacy has been caught and fined for selling expired OTC medication and food items in another state.  It may have been an honest mistake but because of their previous lawsuit and the fact it was a prescription drug that could have had serious consequences I feel I'm responsible to report it.    




 Back in the day when car bodies were made of metal my car battery died.  I didn't have any cables and nobody else did.  We were in a remote area.  I found an extension cord, split the two wires apart and stripped both ends of one wire.  Found a willing soul and we positioned the cars so that the bumpers touched to create a ground then, with both cars off, I clamped one bare end to the positive terminal from one battery then did the same with the other.  Started car one, let it run, then started mine.  Fired right up!  Can't do that anymore! 









 That's so sweet of you but it must be torture!  The same with me but it's popcorn.  I tell my husband to go ahead a make it for himself but he adamantly refuses to.

 I used to take a box of Triscuits, shavings of cheddar cheese and drizzle Sriracha on top.  Before Sriracha was Triscuits, mustard, cheese and dill pickles.  Damn, now I'm hungry!      




 Try dribbling some Sriracha on it!   




 You're welcome.  The best advise I got from a cajun and chili-head is make sure every layer you add to a dish adds either flavor or texture.  For instance, instead of adding just water, even if you're just making Kraft Mac and Cheese, add chicken stock instead of water.  Add some of your spices at the beginning but leave some to throw in at the end.  For texture add some of your veggies from the beginning for aromatics but add additional toward the end for taste and texture.   




 Tried to waffle some KD to go with my burger.  What do you think?

 I don't like to give away all my secrets but here's my general spice packet plus aromatics to 1lbs dried beans or 60 oz canned red beans, Blue Runner of course.

Equal parts black, white and red(cayenne) pepper, 1 tsp ea.
Dried thyme and oregano, 2 Tbsp ea.
Bay leaves, 2
Hot sauce, 1 tsp
Worcestershire, 1 tsp
salt to taste

Onions, green and red bell pepper, minced fresh garlic.

Plus Andouillie sausage(diced), pickled pork(diced) and tasso(minced).

 Thanks!  I like to put pickled pork in my beans but I have to drive pretty far to get it so I make a huge batch and freeze smaller portions.  Sure do miss a lot of things about New Orleans! 




 As an old cook in the Navy I say job well done mate!  I like just a little glaze on mine so I can admire the rings of filling and golden brown rolls but that just my preference.  

I think your portioning was okay but doing it your way makes it hard to get a nice clean slice without "sealing" the cut edges.  This is one reason rolls will bolt up in the middle.                         Before you cut the rolls, refrigerate it covered in plastic for 15 minutes.  This firms up the dough and butter so it won't squish down and the filling doesn't squeeze out.  Using your handy dandy ruler mat as a guide and a very sharp long knife cut your rolls while using your other hand to gently maintain the shape of the roll.  Try not to end up with a  shaped roll but if you do just lightly lay it down and round it out.
Use a bigger pan.  Your rolls are too close together!  They should almost double in size with the second rising.  Also, when you originally roll the dough up, do so as loosely as you can.  That will allow the rolls to expand.  Roll it too tight and they won't proof correctly and can also cause the middle to bolt up.
Just some words of advise from an old salty cook.  Can't wait to see the next batch!  




 Nice job!
 




 Hope you left some for her! 




 You can't "fry" using soy sauce since it contains no oil.  Simmer, boil or poach maybe but not fry.  Even butter has too much water to fry all though I heard of some that have used margarine however, since margarine is just one molecule away from being a plastic I wouldn't.  




 I'd like a cherry pie tree too!  I'd settle for a fruit cocktail tree though. 









 I think it's a work of art and so good!  I hope my friend, Rowdy Dugan is successful with his business!  I bake too but back pain keeps me out of the professional arena for now.  As far as the cherry clafoutis, it's the first thing I make when cherries are in season.

 Even as a chef, when I eat out I pay to have that another chef treat me.  I can always come up with my own stuff and definitely won't pay higher prices just because they have the ingredients on hand! 




 True. Most homeowners/renters insurance covers loss of power usually up to $500.  Don't know if they would cover it because of a defective refrigerator though.  When I lost power for barely over 24 hours I called my insurance company.  They did not send an adjuster out, just began asking what I'd lost.  Rattled off a bunch of expensive cheeses, charcuterie, shellfish, all kinds of imported olives etc.  She asks if I'm a chef, "yes", I tell her and bingo, she awards me the full amount!  Pretty much just had the basics, less than $75.   I know, I'm bad. 




 This just indicates the owner/chef is to lazy or uneducated to create their own salad combinations.  Nothing but a salad bar. 









 Round har we call potatoes taters as in tater salad or tots.               ; )   https://youtu.be/neUaSTSKFZc  









 Looks as though all the chefs got a raging case of diarrhea and the dishwasher had to step in and cook/plate from memory!  Though I know some dishwashers that can plate better lol!
 




 Ohhh YES! 




 Strongly concur.  Never let chicken or turkey come to room temperature! 




 Beautiful bowls of gravy!  Good Job! 




 No wonder our Admiral had his Culinary Specialist cater his Change of Command there! 




 That would be the name of the ship/submarine.  Her Majesty's Ship (HMS) Splendid. 




 Name your offending place of employment now and we will not judge you. 




 No 




 Yes, you can use it to thicken anything you want. 




 7th generation Texan here.  We say pies and bucks.  One thing I've never seen is someone putting Ranch on pizza!  Seriously, why? Hope they're just dipping the pizza bones in it. The closest I've seen are Mississippians who put Catalina dressing on pizza.
