 I wanna lick you.
 




 It's funny. I was thinking that you were a beautiful child when I looked at this. Even though you had long hair as a kid, still. 




 Um, you were always adorable. Dat smile.
 




 Neil Patrick Harris?

Also, you are attractive. Wow. 




 DAMN. 




 God you are so good at this. 




 Apparently, you look like several different celebrities. And asian. 




 That's gonna be one handsome little devil. 




 It was just before my 17th birthday. It was unprotected, in the laundry room, up against a dryer. We tried four different positions and lasted a good half hour, surprisingly, because it was the first time for both of us. And, 'til this day, the sight of a dryer turns me on. 




 Whyyyyy would someone downvote this. 




 Flushing the toilet. 




 When I read this, I read "evil-doer" as "evil-deer" 




 Holy crap. Please tell him that he looks gorgeous.
 




 La Crosse, WI 




 i think /r/ladyboners would like you. 




 Your dog is Fizzgig. 




 For some reason I am imagining you drunk. 




 Well. I don't want my soup anymore.
 




 I think I puked, but I'm not sure because of the disgusting sensory overload this comment just gave me. 




 I almost shit my pants seeing my username. For two incredibly stupid and perhaps conceited seconds, I thought that this post was dedicated to me.
  




 I have so many, I can't even pick. I have nightmares every night. I am also a very vivid dreamer, which is nice when I'm having a good dream, but usually I'm not. Probably five nights out of seven I wake up and have a hard time differentiating between reality and non-reality because every detail in the dream is exactly the way it looks, feels, tastes, smells and sounds like in real life. It is perfect to the level of Inception. But I will tell three of my particularly disturbing dreams, in chronological order.

The first disturbing dream I remember happened when I was five years old. I had a dream that trees were mad that humans were using them for paper and our own selfish needs and so they revealed that they could talk (they actually looked a lot like the trees in the Wizard of Oz, except more menacing) and they took over the world. There were particular types of trees, like the birch and the sequoia (among others), that they had rejected because they were "peaceful" and didnt want to harm the humans. Anyway, the dominating tree types had put all humans in concentration camp-looking places and at meal times they gave us a plate with three different types of bark on it. Two  of the types were from the "dominating" tree races that had died naturally and the other was from the "lesser" trees that they had killed. If you were lucky youd get something like birch, because if you happened to eat the bark from the dominating trees, you were deemed unworthy to serve the trees because you were unable to differentiate between your "masters" and your "enemies." In the dream, I was sitting on my cousin's lap (she used to babysit me a lot) and I remember picking up my fork and pointing to each one. She had become great at telling the difference so she always helped me. She told me which one not to eat, and because I was a child, of course I ate that one. Immediately, the tree-guard standing by me picked me up and threw me into its gaping mouth. It digested me and I could feel my legs burning as I heard my cousin's hysterical screams. Then I woke up.

The second one was when I was about thirteen or fourteen. I had watched Disturbia with one of my friends and about a month later, I had this dream. I was sitting on the couch, watching static on the TV as it stormed outside. The way our house was set up, you could see all the way to the back door in the kitchen two rooms away from the living room. Lighting crashed and i saw a shadow of a man in the livingroom. I looked to the right and I saw the Killer from Disturbia staring into the glass of the back door. The light from the static on the TV barely reached him, so the shadows made his eyes look like empty sockets. We stared at each other for a good ten seconds before he opened his mouth ghoulishly wide and screamed in rage. He started trying to smash the window in and I bolted upstairs and leaped underneath the covers. In my dream, I poked my finger through one of the holes that was *actually in my covers in real life*. I pulled out some of the polyester filling nervously and started playing with it, hoping he wouldnt find me. Suddenly, I heard loud rapping on my window that was right across the room from my bed. It thundered again, and I realize now that this is when I woke up, but in real life I could still hear the rapping at the window, and I was still playing with the filler because I had taken it out in my sleep. I lied in bed for a good hour before I peeked out from under the covers and saw a tree branch tapping on my window and realized it wasn't real. My body ached for a couple days after that from that hour of tensing up in pure terror.

The last one I'll tell happened last night. I'll tell you an abridged version since this comment is already way too long. Basically, my boyfriend and I started living with these people who were in a cult and lived in the shittiest, low down abandoned house you can imagine. Think Fight Club but multiply the shittiness by about ten. I went into the bathroom in our room to wash my face, and i opened the mirrored cabinet door to find a cut up baby and its face was right on the level of my face. I was frozen. And then it smilled and laughed at me. Its mouth started spurting blood along with its other body parts. In the dream I had just found out I was pregnant.  




 I'm not sure if this is mean or not, but it made me really angry. I am not one bit overweight and my (now ex) boyfriend told me that I should work out because he "wanted to see what it was like" to see me smaller. And then he said, "If I dont like it, I'll tell you to gain weight back." Then, after a little more thinking on his part, he said, "Nevermind, I like you the way you are. Don't do anything."

I never said that I didnt like the way I looked or anything, and he never took into consideration what i wanted my body to look like. It was just as if he owned it and could tell me what to do with it.  




 No. 
Your cat's high. 




 The first song I heard by them was Panic Switch and I instantly obsessed, but then it sort of died out a little. I forgot about this song for a while and now im hooked again. 




 I know that feel, bro. I'm basically still a lurker, except I'm the Oprah of upvotes. 




 Does anyone know what I'm talking about when I say that this is maybe a million times worse than Talking Tina from The Twilight Zone? 




 I regularly babysat for my neighbor's daughter, and the day this happened was just a regular day. We were walking to the park, and in the parking lot she saw a puddle that had oil in it, which was making a rainbow. She looked at it and looked up at me to see that I had seen it as well. I smiled back at her. We didn't mention it for the rest of the night. It was just one of those mundane and seemingly insignificant occurrences.

I feel I should also mention that she hardly ever talked except to say something absolutely brilliant and creative, except she was a little morbid.

 I was scared to see her at night, since she looked like a typical little girl that should have been in a horror movie (blue eyes that pierced through your soul, pale with very dark brown hair that could have been black, nightgown etc.) and it was usually at night when she woke up to deliver one of these glimpses into her strange little mind.

She had gotten out of bed absolutely silently and had stepped slightly in  front of me, where I was sitting on the couch, watching TV. I jumped a little. Never got used to it.

She asked me, "That rainbow? That we saw on the ground today? It fell from the sky, and it died, didn't it?" Then she got really close to my face.  "And you just SMILED." 

I was too creeped out to go back there. Now when I see one of those puddles on the ground I get shudders. Her mind must be a scary place. 




 Best comment I have read all day. 




 Oh my god. These kids are terrible...it makes me wonder what kind of things they have experienced to be able to do that to someone...such bad things happen in this world.  
























 I would suggest a curling wand. I have long hair and it works wonders for me. Some can be expensive, like between $100 and $200 but the one I have is ConAir brand and its right at the top of your price range. They can run for a lot more expensive than $40 so I thought it was a pretty good deal.

I suggest a wand because it doesn't have a clamp, so you don't get that annoying little kink at the end when you try to curl your hair. All you do is wrap your hair around it, hold it there for a bit, and let it go. It makes really tight curls or really bouncy beach waves depending on the size of the section you are wrapping. The bigger the section, the bigger the waves. 

Also, if it's your first time using it, be careful! It's really easy to burn yourself on it. 




 That dog is so cute! I know this isn't the point of your post, but could I get a better look at your tattoo? I kinda like tattoos...a lot. 




 That creepy smile.... 




 When I heard they were from La Crosse, I thought to myself, "Oh dear lord. I hope I know at least one of them." 




 this is really sad.
 




 The best part is the empty chip bag. 




 To me she looks like Kaley Cuoco, I don't know if I'm just crazy or what.
 




 Assuming you are referring to the Bible, I'm pretty sure that set of laws from Leviticus were for Jewish people before the time of Jesus. They are not Christian. 




 But if he said that, it would be interpreted as a pickup line and not a dig. He thought she was pregnant because she was *glowing,* not because he thought she was fat.  




 Smooth as fuck. 




 I came here to say exactly this. Upvote for you. 




 My brother and I are close in age, and my little sister is tall for her age and has abnormally large feet. I am 18 and she is 12 and her feet are almost bigger than mine.

Anyway, when we were kids, my mom always bought us all socks that looked almost identical, and we would all have screaming matches over whose socks we had. Pretty stupid. 




 I worked at this one fairly successful family-owned restaurant as a waitress where the two owners hardly ever hired men, made at least one waitress cry every day, treated the hispanic workers like shit, and where they discriminated against and harassed the pregnant women.

 It was the most stressful thing that I have ever had to do. At the time, I was 17 and I had school, but they were hesitant to work with my schedule. At first they gave me too many hours a week for me (about 28-30) and then they gave me too little hours (about 10). Also, there was one time where I worked a 12 hour day and got one 20 min break. I'm not entirely sure about the legality of that situation, but it certainly felt illegal. 

Also, if you made a mistake, the owners weren't afraid of yelling at you in front of the customers and they would also smack-talk you to the people sitting at your table. It once was so bad that the customers at my table actually stood up for me and told one of the owners that they were never coming back because of the way they treated their waitstaff. That day, the owner tried to fire me because of that situation. My only mistake was that the customer wanted pecan pancakes and I accidentally typed in regular pancakes. I almost let her fire me, but I needed the job and the tips could be great on a good day. 




 This is absolutely ridiculous. "What's the lasting effect on two young boys being sent to jail?" well what's the fucking effect of RAPE ON THE VICTIM.

Also, they made it sound like the fact that there was alcohol made it okay that she got raped.

And so many other things that I could just rant about 
 




 So that was terrifying.

 We broke up during our first couple months at college. I thought I was still in love with him then, and all I wanted to do was just talk to him. I wanted nothing more than to get back together with him. Then, later on he came to visit me the weekend before Thanksgiving break. We went to a party together, and I got drunk, but he didn't drink a single drop. By the time we got back, I was still a little tipsy. I got into bed, and he pulled out a condom and asked me if I wanted to have sex. Of course, drunk little test_subject8773 said yes. And it wasnt only the alcohol, I had genuine feelings for him. He had sex with me, finished in five minutes, then went to bed and hadnt touched me other than to put his dick in me. I asked if we could cuddle and maybe he could touch me a little and he told me that he was too tired and that cuddling would be uncomfortable and make him too hot. The next morning I asked if we were going to get back together, and he said "I dont know, my parents don't really like you all that much and I don't know if we should get serious again." Keep in mind, we lost our virginities to each other about a year and a half beforehand, and I was the only person he ever had sex with. That is still true today. It's not even like hes this big player who doesnt care about girls. He does. He just doesnt care about me. 




 "Kickin in the front seat, chillin in the back seat, gotta make my mind up, which seat can I take??" 




 Wow, this is awesome!
 




 Only child? 




 Do you have a link to that AMA? 




 Mmm. 




 why is a repost this blatant on the front page. 




 I just got goosebumps all over just watching that. ewewewewewew 




 wat 




 Did she have siblings? If she did, maybe she was verifying her own feelings about them. Maybe she feels that she doesn't love her sibling or wouldn't cry if they died.  




 Not gonna lie, this would scare the shit outta me every time I walked into the bathroom. Even if I were the owner. 




 What a motherfucker. 





























 [Here you go.](http://stream1.gifsoup.com/webroot/animatedgifs5/1978595_o.gif) Makes me cringe a little for the girl though. Yeesh.

Jiffy! 00:33-00:37 




 Thanks!
 




 Thanks! 




 Thanks for the suggestion, I hadn't thought about doing that! 




 Ive kinda been doing baby steps into keto, like much less carbs and lots more veggies and protein, but I still give myself some allowances sometimes instead of just changing cold turkey. 

I also just finished my first year of college, and it having been summer vacation and being home really has changed a lot of things. I eat a lot less at meal times and I tend to snack less. 

I try to get out and powerwalk for about a half hour a couple times a week, but I really do owe most of my weight loss to my diet. 

The loss has been since probably the beginning of June, so maybe a month, maybe more? 

And thank you, I really do appreciate your kind words. The problem with these pictures, though, is that they are at a slight upward angle. It is really different with better lighting, and when I look at myself in one of those all angle mirrors, I do look a little different. For example, this is a picture taken of me on the fourth of July [(I'm on the left).](http://i.imgur.com/vst2Irt.jpg) My legs look great, and I have a bit of a food baby, so just disregard that roundness, but I do have some fat left in my arms and face that I want to get rid of. And I know its possible for me to be 125 again because that's what I was a year ago at the same height! haha 









 How did you do it? because my starting weight is 138 as well and i want to get down to 125, and we are also the same height. 




 Youre my inspiration, holy crap.
 




 Hey, I know that it's kind of late to be commenting, but as a 62 kg f/18/5'4" trying to lose about 4.5-6 kg, I have to know. Did your boobs get smaller? I really like where mine are at right now (so does my boyfriend) and I can only imagine that I would be kind of sad about it. Did yours get smaller, and how did you feel about it? 




 what was the music in this?
 




 It would go nice with card that says "Eat Shit." 




 I usually wouldn't say anything about this, but this post made me cringe. The amount of misogyny, accidental or not, on Reddit really shouldn't surprise me, but it never fails to. "You're plus sized, but you've found a way to make yourself look more appealing for my benefit, even though your physical appearance has nothing to do with me? Good girl." Yikes, guys. 




 You clever bastard. 




 You can unsubscribe to /r/atheism so that you never have to see that again. 




 Congratulations! Wow, she really loves you. I don't know if I could tell my SO the same thing. I bet she is lovin' your new body as much as you do! 




 Dang, you are HOT. 




 My friend got his last name down his side, and is planning to get his mother's maiden name down his other side. It's like a tribute to both sides of his family, sort of. 




 Sneezing when it doesn't indicate that they are sick or when it doesnt have any foreshadowing purposes. Just sneezing.
 




 what was the comment?
 




 Thank you, this is really cute! Sorry I took so long to reply, I haven't been on reddit lately. 




 /r/mildlyinfuriating is your home, brother
 




 Oh, duh. I'm sorry. I got all mixed up with usernames. Yeah, shoulder-length hair might be hard to do with a wand. 




 Your hair is definitely long enough; I have a friend whose hair is your length and I have curled it many times before. Sometimes it's hard to get the hang of it because the hair tends to slide off when you curl it, especially if your hair is freshly washed or really shiny and smooth. I'd start at the thick end of the barrel and wrap down, because the hair does slip a bit. Also, make sure you are doing it tight enough.  




 I love this. I wish I could give you more upvotes. 




 I read this and wanted to downvote something, but I wasn't sure what. Then I realized I just wanted to give Reddit one big downvote. 




 Random side note...you look like OAG. 




 I absolutely adore your natural color, so I don't think you should dye it, but If you're looking for a change, I'd say dark chocolate brown hair would look great on you, especially if you got a pixie cut. You could definitely pull that haircut off.

I'm not sure if you meant colorful as in blue or pink hair or something like that, so if you did, i think a blue-fade-to-purple ombre with a pixie cut would look great. It would go great with your eyeshadow. :) 
























 Im so excited for this! Placeholder! 




 Its actually a mix between two colors: Revlon colorstay matte balm in the colors Audacious and Showy. I put Audacious on over Showy to make a pinky-coral. And I got it dyed professionally the first time, but I used L'oreal Hi-Color Hilights in Red, which is the same color as the salon color, and I continue to use that on my roots. But when I touch up the middle and ends of my hair I use Beyond the Color Zone in Wild Red! Hope that helps! 




 Thank you! 









 Good, I'm glad I could be some help!
 




 Thanks, I have been trying to figure out the best way to make the most of my lashes for years so I really appreciate that! :) 




 I kind of do a combination of both? Haha. If you're going to do the wiggle, do it right at the root of your lashes and then swipe the rest of the way up. I find that way works best for me. And if you want added length, what I do is close my eye and put some mascara just at the tips so it really builds at the ends instead of building thicker in the middle. Hope that helps! 









 Aw, thank you! 




 Haha, thanks, I appreciate that! I'm always worried about looking like I'm wearing too many colors. 




 Wow, this is absolutely gorgeous! I love that lip color on you. I would say that if you want your features to stand out more in pictures, you might wanna turn up the drama on your eyes so that your beautiful features don't get lost in the distance! Perhaps that's not the look you want to go for, but that's what I would recommend. :) 




 Thank you!

 I was going through these contests with my friends and your Disney one totally caught our eye! They urged me to do an Ariel inspired look, since my hair is bright red, and I've absolutely loved the movie since I was a child. I hope that everything goes okay at the hospital! Enjoy!  http://imgur.com/a/ccX3J#0

Edit: Totally sorry for the potato quality. I dont have a real camera lol. 




 Is your puppy a Yorkie-Poo? He looks exactly like my dog at my parents' house. I miss him so much now that I saw your dog.  




 Man, you really need to work on your tact and your people skills in general.... 




 Wow, you remind me so much of Lorde. 




 Thanks so much! will definitely be getting this one after reading about it. 



















 I just came here to say that you made a beautiful choice! The hair cut and color makes you look like a different person entirely. I love it! It's so cute! 




 Holy shit. I wouldn't even spend that much money on MYSELF.  









 I think your eyebrows are gorgeous. Your eyes and lip color are also very pretty, but I think that if youre going to have super sparkly bold eyes like that, you need to balance them out with a more nude lip color, and if youre going to go with the bold lip color, a more neutral eye look would do best. Right now the colors are kind of taking over your face rather than enhancing it. My rule is that I pick one thing about my face I want to show off that day and enhance it,
 




 The fucking kitchen scissors. I dont even need them all that often but i see them every day UNTIL I need to use them. 
























 Thanks for doing this contest! This is my boyfriend's favorite movie, and the movie we watched together when we had our first kiss :) So here is my [inspiration.](http://i.imgur.com/8HHM6g5.jpg) :) 

I figured that since it was a romantic scene, I would do a romantic look. My phone's camera sucks, so you cant really see how vibrant the colors are, but I loved the amount of color and life in the movie, especially the oranges and blues and purples. [Here's mah face.](http://imgur.com/a/VW05s) Hope you enjoy!

 




 I LOVE MA FACE!!

Here are my[ pictures!](http://imgur.com/a/9qWZy#WKGXawB)

First off, I have a scar (that's barely noticeable anymore) on my nose. I got it in Kindergarten when I had the chicken pox. I ran into a wall face first and it scraped off! I love telling that story. I used to hate it because it was a little deeper back when I was young but I think its cute now. 

Second, it might be hard to see but I have three beauty marks on my face. They're close to my hairline on my temple and the third is higher up on my forehead.

Third I have just one dimple! I like this because I never discovered this until I took some senior photos when I was 17. I hardly have any pictures of me actually smiling because I used to be very self conscious about my teeth.

Fourth, my teeth. I always hated them until I got to college. I never wanted to smile with my teeth. My parents couldn't afford braces and so I never got the front two fixed. But now I appreciate that it makes me unique. My boyfriend always tells me I have a cute smile and so I had to put this in here, because I know he will see this. Love you!

Fifth, and lastly, my nose. I used to despise it because of the chicken pox scar and because of how wide it is, but I have learned to embrace it. People never believe me when I tell them that I am part African American from my mother's side. I am proud to be black, and the only features I have to show for it are my dark eyes, darker skin tone, and my nose. The other parts of me, French, German, Irish, and Native American, have definitely managed to shine through as well, haha. 

Hmm. I would say I'm special because I care about everyone and try to help everyone with everything, even if I can see that sometimes they're taking advantage of me. A little kindness goes a long way, I say.  




 Thanks! I only have my ears pierced once, so I'm going to start on those. I want to have my ears double pierced with a cartilage piercing on one ear and after that get triple forward helix piercings on both ears :) 




 Not to give any discredit to the piercer, but she seemed to be in quite a hurry when she did it. I came in and already knew that I wanted a horseshoe. She just picked a size, pierced me, gave me some directions on how to clean and sent me on my way. I was so excited and it all happened so fast that I didn't even realize that she didn't tell me what size mine is :( and now I'm not even in Eau Claire anymore, so I have to go to the place I usually go and try and have that place size it. 

I wish I could help you out more!  




 Thanks :) I'll have to ask someone about that. I haven't had any problems so far, but I'll look into it.  




 Thank you so much! :) 














 Holy crap I went in the comments to see if this was the tiny town where my University is located by and sure enough. 




 The other people who commented already said what I was going to say about your contour, but dang, you remind me so much of Adele! 




 You picked the wrong sister. 




 Jaja, gracias! :) Eres de los Estados Unidos, u otro pais? 




 Darn it 




 yeah, it takes me directly to my album. I don't know what's going on! 




 Wait a minute, for me it doesn't look like it didnt link correctly
 









 Thank you! 




 Yes! Well at least I think so. Even my boyfriend's brother noticed how smooth my face looked and heaven knows that's some kind of miracle 




 Gracias! He listado mis productos favoritos en otro comentario! 

Haha I appreciate the Spanish. 




 Oh goodness. If I had to pick one it would be Rimmel's Stay Matte Primer. I have pretty dang oily skin, so it really helps with that. It feels kind of thick going on, but it tones down the oiliness and helps me maintain a dewy finish. It's probably one of my favorite finds because I had searched for months for a good primer and I finally found it. Also, Clump Crusher. I can't live without it, and I can't find a mascara I like more. Another one would have to be Revlon's Colorstay Matte Balms, because they are so easy to apply and I can't be bothered some days to whip out my lipstick and my lipstick brush and try to perfectly line my lips and all of that.  




 So, I kind of broke a rule (oops) as I've posted before without doing an intro. /u/blanksy was kind enough to remind me in chat that I needed to do one!

Anywho, I just wanted to say that I love this subreddit, and love the idea of having contests and being able to commit random acts of kindness within the context of makeup. This subreddit is so supportive and kind. I reaallllly love makeup and have a growing collection. My friends think I'm crazy obsessed, but they don't mind so much when they need someone to do their makeup, haha. I've only recently had the ability to start feeding into my hobby more in terms of finances and RAoM really makes me feel like I have a home and a comfortable place to showcase what I have learned over the years. Thanks for that!

My other hobbies include singing, reading, and listening to music. I also study Spanish so if anyone here speaks Spanish or is also learning we can practice together. I think that's it! Keep being fabulous! 




 I would say that my biggest thing about doing makeup on other people is that I might have to adjust some things according to who I am putting the look on, even if I'm trying to achieve the same thing for several different people. This is especially true for different eye types. 

When I do makeup on other people, I realized the thing that gave me the most trouble is doing their liner, especially wings, which I have a feeling you are going to be making use of. On yourself, it is much easier to close your eyelid or start from the inner corner or the middle and draw the wing out that way. I suggest that you have them look straight on at you, and you draw the wing first, so that you can draw a wing that is appropriate for the type of eye they have, otherwise it could look a bit cartoonish or just flat-out ridiculous. 

Also, I would say if you have someone with hooded eyes, you might want to search a couple youtube tutorials about maximizing their lid space. I have friends with hooded eyes who feel that eyeshadow is a lost cause on them when it really doesn't have to be that way! One important thing I always try to remember is to make sure that if you do anything sparkly or dramatic on someone with a hooded eye, you should try to put whatever crease color you are using (if youre using one) a little bit above their actual natural socket, because otherwise the shadow gets lost. 

If you would like a little bit of advice about different eye shapes, [this eye shape video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9bdkpypZKElist=UUCvoAe__WFYMNAEN-C-CtYA)
 is very helpful because he provides examples of celebrities with those different shapes. He also just did [a smokey eye tutorial for hooded eyes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tq3EB4NepKYlist=UUCvoAe__WFYMNAEN-C-CtYA) which you might also want to take a look at.

Hope this helps a little! Have fun!
 




 Why thank you! I guess that's what happens when your mother is half black and your dad is a blond haired blue eyed German! haha.  




 Thank you, I'm always worried that there are too many colors on my face haha
 




 Thank you so much! Wow, what a compliment. She is absolutely gorgeous.  




 Thank you :) 




 Thank you! I used Clean and Clear Morning Burst moisturizer, Rimmel's Stay Matte Primer (which really gives me more of a dewy look because I have oily skin) and Maybelline's FitMe liquid foundation in the shade 120. I apply the foundation with a stippling brush, which gives me more of a smooth finish! I also used a little bit of blush that's a really generic, cheap brand that I don't even remember the name of anymore, haha. The primer is awesome...its really thick and I find it fills my pores and keeps my makeup from slipping around all at the same time. 




 Thanks so much! I actually use Elf's Cream liner in Black and an angled brush to apply. I used to use liquid, but I find I like the more matte look of the cream better :) 




 Thanks!
 
























 Yeah, you might wanna get that changed out or something. But mine cost about that much. Where i live, generally the type of jewelry will determine whether it costs 35, 45, or 55 dollars for the piercing. I dont think you have much to worry about other than the fact that you have a hoop in instead of a curved barbell.. 




 A complisult?
 




 Your third paragraph makes a lot of sense. And I definitely understand that. I'm just saying I've had a realllyyyyyy hard time getting a word in about my experience as a lightskinned mixed girl, and I think that our group could benefit from varying perspectives, because I've seen other mixed girls be shunned like I have in other settings. I never even suggest that my experiences are as severe, and in fact I acknowledge it. It would just be nice for someone to know that there is this problem of not fitting in with the black community or the white community, which to me is a little ironic. 

Also, about the bisexuality piece, it's funny that you mention that, I've experienced that too actually! I am bisexual. Thank you for posting this, everything you said I've totally been able to identify with.  




 Thank you for posting this! 




 Exactly. It's really hard though, there isn't anyone else who seems to have the same experiences and all of the light-skinned people in the room introduce themselves as "allies." It's so difficult when I'm met with so much opposition and people just laugh at me and brush it off, and when I'm offended, I don't have a right to be offended because they think what theyre doing isnt really damaging and that I'm being a baby.  









 So, I'll start out with saying I'm part black (from my mom's side). I can pass as white, but people mostly think that I am hispanic. 

My whole life, my mother was the one who was there for me and raised me and taught me about racism and oppression, as well as helped me through bad racial experiences. For example, in fifth grade, I got microbraids and a girl in my class scoffed at me, told me they were ugly, and that they were for "real" black people. 

Now, I've tried to get involved with Black Student Unity on my university campus and I won't lie. The questions they asked me and the things they assume are sometimes just as ignorant as when white people come up to me and start splurting out random racist bullshit. The black community likes to say "So how are you even black? Which side is it from? Is your mom light skinned or something? You're not really black, you're mostly European." And then the kicker, "You're not even that black, you probably haven't even experienced much oppression and racism." UM, hello  And it makes me super uncomfortable and angry because I do mostly identify as African American. I'm not saying I don't have more privilege, I definitely do and I won't deny that my experiences might not be as extreme, but that doesn't mean my experiences should be brushed off. There are many ways to be black and the black community is not one lumped together homogeneous group.They also criticize me for dating a white guy, saying if i were really black then I'd want to date a black guy, which is SO. STUPID. 

THEN, there's the white community, who I'm not "white enough" for. I get told I'm "exotic," I have to basically argue with people to convince them that my mom is black, but then they tell me that I'm not black enough to fully identify as a black person. But obviously I'm not white enough to identify as a white person either, so what am I supposed to do?

Anyway, I could go on forever about it but I really needed the black community at my university because it's predominantly white and it would have been nice to hang out with people of similar cultural background, but they weren't accepting whatsoever. Does anyone else who is multiracial experience this? 




 Please take that out! Like /u/daveoldham131 said, it's way too deep and if you leave that in your nipple is going to swallow it up. Research some good piercers in your area, and have someone take a look at it. They'll probably tell you the same thing and tell you where you can go from there.  




 That's actually what I thought at first, but I originally had jewelry that was too small, so i developed pockets on either sides of my nipples that now stick out, so they look too deep but are actually at the base of my nipple.  









 Anything that ends in "...for a girl."

Hey, you wanna see how hard I punch...for a girl? 




 "When can we go again?" 




 Right, and that's really good, but there are forces that will try to make you feel guilty for being who you are other than religion, too. Sometimes when you're young and you discover these things about yourself, you get older and it tires you out that people constantly demand that you explain yourself when you shouldn't have to. I know that in my experience, I grow weary of the prejudice, even as I learn to stand up for myself. And the worst part is that it comes from people a lot of times that you've known your whole life and that you're really close to. 

You should also know that sexuality is a fluid, dynamic thing, and it changes and grows while you change and grow. It's okay not to be able to call yourself one thing, or discover that you think you actually might be more of one thing that another. There are a lot of people who are out there who will call themselves your supporters, yet you feel judgement coming from them because they believe that you are free to do what you want and have your own preferences, but you must choose an identity and call yourself that. That's something that will be really hard as well, people who don't understand that it is okay to be in a constant state of not knowing. 




 Well usually identifying as bisexual means attracted to both males and females , but pansexuality is not limited to just male and female. Pansexuality means you are attracted to male, female, and even more complicated combinations of sexualities and gender identities than that, like transgendered people, and so on. I know that it's confusing, but some people don't even just identify as one gender or the other, and some people have had sex changes, or are going through hormone replacement therapy. Pansexuality covers that wide range.

 




 I say good for you! I didn't realize ( or come to terms with, I should probably say) my sexuality until this past year, and I'm 19 going on 20. I'm glad that you can be sure of yourself so young. 

If I had to give you any advice, I would say be strong and keep going on being confident in knowing who you are. Don't let anyone tell you that youre wrong, or that it's just a phase. I had the feelings that I feel now when I was a young child but coming from a Catholic upbringing and being told homoerotic tendencies were a sin made me stuff that part of myself deep down. I still feel a little guilt about it.

Also, you might end up finding out you have "friends" who can't seem to accept that part of you. It's going to suck, but you have to be prepared to explain things you shouldn't have to to people when they find out, like "no, I'm not half gay and half straight" or "no, I'm not greedy." That was the hardest part for me, telling people that I wasn't going through some "crazy college girl" phase and that it was a legitimate part of my identity.    














 Turns out this photo is not of the user in the title. Doesn't matter. Whoever this guy is, he's hot.  














 That is really hard. It's so much better to do it as soon as possible, in any case. She's also got the support of her family around, and she's soon going to go off to do new things and start a new chapter in her life. Hopefully that will ease the pain a little, for her, and for you. 




 I just have to say one thing, if your therapist has diagnosed you with something you don't think is true, please get a second and third opinion. She is going to treat you based on what she thinks you have. 

Also, if it's possible, it might be a good idea to seek out a different therapist. Your therapist isn't supposed to bother you. Your therapist is  supposed make you face uncomfortable things, but is not supposed to bother you as a person. You know what I'm saying? 




 Yeah it's American :) 




 JC Penney, actually!  














 In the second picture, you look a lot like Helena Bonham Carter! 




 Beautiful! Haha and don't worry, I stand that way all the time too. 





























 Thank you so much for your reply. I really recommend that you do write her something. And even if you never get the courage to send it, keep it and look at it every now and then until you do :)

And yeah about the whole therapist thing, I told mine before I left for winter break that I wish I could have those really good daughter-mother relationships that a lot of my friends have, and she told me that I didn't have to have one person with all the qualities a good mother would have, it might be enough if I have several people with one or two of those good qualities. That's something that has really helped me be less sad about not having a good relationship with her. 




 Thank you! And yes, she does have a really twisted sense of Christianity like that. I know she's going around twisting the story and what I wrote her, but I know she's also probably panicking on the inside about what I might be telling people.  




 I love this!!
 




 I hated this so much about my Nmom. She would do the same thing, except she would interrupt me while i was *answering a question she asked me.* And then could not see how incredibly rude she was being. 

These things will never cease to amaze me. 




 [The original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2qd73m/hyperreligious_nmom_kicked_me_out_today_merry/) 

 It's pretty short, for those who don't like to read a lot of text all at once.

Anyway, I just sent this message to my mother last night, for some stupid reason. I know it won't make a difference, but it made me feel better that I got some of that out directly to her. It reads:

"Hey, thanks for unfriending me on Facebook. Now i don't have do it myself. Just wanted to say a couple things in case i don't talk to you or see you ever again. I thought you should know your daughter is part of the LGBT community (pansexual to be exact), a multiple-event rape survivor, and a severely depressed and suicidal member of society. So excuse me for having a problem with religion and the way you decide to be a "Christian". And excuse me for wanting to get away from your psychotic, violent episodes.I'm not sure what your problem has always been with me but you sure as hell made it so i couldn't trust you enough to talk to you about what was really going on in my life and why i am so angry. There are so many things i can say about how your actions over the years have really really messed me up. But it'll be lost on you. I hope you feel really guilty about abusing someone emotionally and physically who did nothing to stop you. And I hope you feel really guilty about acting as crazy as grandma and papa. I know you know what you did was wrong, and i know you'll never admit it. I hope you realize that you've ruined any sort of relationship we could have had. Good luck living with that. You burned your side of the bridge and now I'm burning mine. Im incredibly sad about the loss of my siblings, and that they had to witness what they did, on Christmas of all days. I have to protect myself, however, if i even want to live to see them grow up. I hope you feel terrible that your last words to me included "get this evil witch out of my house." I don't know what kind of mother says that to her child about a stupid argument, but it's no mother of mine. Have a good life, [mother's first name]."

I wanted to write this to her so that she could realize HER actions have consequences, and that she's doing the opposite of making things hard for me. She's made my life a whole hell of a lot easier by cutting off contact and kicking me out of the house. I also used her first name because to her, that's one of the most disrespectful things you can do to a parent. Also, she would always complain about how she had a terrible childhood at the hands of my grandma and grandpa, and that what she did to me didn't compare (which, we all know is not a valid excuse to treat me the way she did my whole life), even though it really does compare.

It just felt really good to do. My heart was pounding the whole time. I kept imagining all of the terrible things she would say back, but I realized she doesn't have any power over me if I don't let her.

It was seen at 9:09 this morning, by the way. She hasn't responded. Maybe that means she's thinking. Maybe that means she's concocting a particularly nasty retort. I don't really care, all I know is that I've gotten what I needed to off my chest and the irrational guilt I have carried my whole life  has been transferred from me to her. Whether she realizes it or not. 




 My boyfriend's family is giving me a place to stay. They're wonderful and absolutely amazing. I feel bad for all the kids in my situation who aren't as lucky as I am :/ 




 She told me I was ruining her holiday.
She called me an evil witch.
She told me that she rebukes me and rejects my worldly, evil ways.
She hit me and punched me and is standing outside my door screaming at me to get out over and over as I pack.
She told me I was dead to her.
And you know what, Reddit?

This is possibly the best Christmas present I have ever received. She's finally out of my life forever.
Going to be needing a lot of internet-hugs today, all. Love you guys.

EDIT: Thank you guys! I ended up moving in with my boyfriend's family until I go back to school at the end of January. We had a very lovely time at his family christmas. They always make me feel so welcome. I'm really thankful for all the helpful and supportive comments, it means a lot! Merry Christmas! 




 Why do you ask?

Edit: I'm an idiot. Yeah, it is. But he's my step-dad. He's sired the two youngest. Gross. I never want to think about that again 




 Yeah and they could go tell lies about each other to the animals living on it lol 




 Thank you for taking the time to respond like this. I don't want to be sad and angry every year but it's hard not to think of it and mourn for the mother and the life I wish I had. I'm also severely depressed, so the sad and angry parts go back to my "rut" thinking. 

I am extremely appreciative for my bf. I don't think he will ever realize what that small gesture meant to me. If he hadn't everything would have been shit. It's extremely symbolic of the role he plays in the rest of my life, as well.  




 She is. I have LC with her. She seems to be coming around, the tiniest bit. This incident was summer of 2013. Like I said, she's not as bad as some Nmoms. She still digs into me but the LC is helping a little bit. I am extremely anxious to go home for winter break, because I don't want things to go to shit like they had last winter and this past summer. My bf's mom has already offered to let me stay at their house as soon as things get bad. 

She has a bad background as well and while I understand that, I don't accept it as an excuse for her behavior. She's treated me badly and I've not treated people like she has. All I can do is hope that she can behave herself for a month or so.  




 I have lots of stories about my mom that I could tell you guys, but this was one that will stick with me for the rest of my life. Now, my mother doesn't exhibit all N behaviors, but many of them. The most prevalent of them is conditional "unconditional" love, as well as treating me as property.

To give a little bit of background, I grew up in a poor family. My mother is the only income for five kids. When I went off to college, I knew I would be paying for it all on my own, so I did, obviously not expecting any help.

In our family, my mother, my two sisters, my little brother, my boyfriend, and my boyfriend's mom ALL have birthdays within three weeks of Christmas. To any normal person, it would be understandable that, come Christmas time, I wouldn't have a lot of money for presents, right? I made cards for everyone, wished everyone happy birthdays and hugged them and told them I loved them. 

For my parents' anniversary in May, I couldn't afford to give them anything but a card and tell them Happy Anniversary and offer to babysit so they could go on a date.

For both of these events, my mother huffed and puffed and made a big deal about how I didnt appreciate her on her most special days and starting screaming at me about how she would ALWAYS make sure that us kids had presents on Christmas and our birthdays and on any other special days. I just took the abuse, but how can you expect an extremely poor, extremely depressed college kid with no time for a job and no car to afford 300 dollars worth of gifts?

So, come my birthday in August, I wake up in the morning, excited about my special day. Usually my dad and siblings will decorate the dining room and there will be presents on the table. I woke up, and there was nothing. That was fine with me, I could deal with it if my mom was angry with me. I didn't know it would actually be worse than that. 

She sat me down and told me there would be no presents for me that day. She told everyone to avoid looking at me, no one was allowed to wish me happy birthday, i wasnt allowed to see my friends (the few I had), I had to stay home and clean and babysit while my mom went out to do whatever it is she wanted to do. She told me it was because I didn't care enough about everyone else and that I didn't do enough to appreciate them, even though I had always wrote or made cards since i was little, and though all through high school I helped my mom out with money and childcare and sacrificed my social life (which I didn't have because she never let me go anywhere or see anyone) for whatever it was that she "needed" me to do.

I was crushed, obviously. I didn't care so much about the fact that I wasn't getting any presents, but the fact that she actually wanted to hurt me so badly that she called all of my relatives telling them not to call me on my birthday, or send presents, and told my immediate family that they were allowed to treat me like shit on my birthday.  It was also hard to  realize that I actually was a scapegoat and I wasn't just imagining it. I have a brother who is only two years my junior and she expected none of these things from him. It was humiliating and degrading.

I cried all day that day. I did exactly as she told me to. My Edad was cold and cruel to me, and wouldn't let me sit down to cry even for a minute, and threatened to call my mother if I didn't get up. I watched the kids while he napped and watched tv. My boyfriend, a knight in shining armor if I've ever seen one, came over anyway and gave me a dozen roses. I didn't let him come in the house, and let him stay for only ten minutes for fear that he would become the next target of my mother's craziness later on.

I will think about this and be sad and angry EVERY YEAR on my birthday because of this. I will think of the time I felt worthless and ignored and helpless. And every present or praise I receive from her will never feel like love and will always tell me that I only got those things from her because I have sated her selfish appetite.

It completely ruined any trust I was trying to have with her. I now see that "love" is a transaction for her and I am very hesitant to accept any help or gifts from her, because I know it comes with leverage for bargain and manipulation. It's spilled into all of my other relationships with people too. I cannot accept help, even when I need it, and am very suspicious of those who make offers with no strings attached. I will always resent her for that. 
 









 Its actually not the best quality of metal. I ordered it pretty cheap on Amazon because I just wanted a little variety. The metal is pretty bad to tell the truth but it looks so nice. As long as I only wear it for a day or two it doesnt irritate me or turn my nose green but I wouldn't risk wearing it for longer than that at a time. Bad, I know. But I was desperate haha.  




 Thank you! 




 Haha do it! It would look great on you! 



















 Exactly :) 




 I only drink like once a week, but the people I hang out like to make fun of the fact that I'm a lightweight and that one drink too many can put me way over. I don't puke or run off or turn into an asshole, it's just really apparent that I'm drunk when I am. 









 What color did you use? Look gorg! 




 Where did you order these? They look cute on you! 




 Wow! What color is this? 




 You look like Ariana Grande! 




 Where did you get that jewelry from? 




 Its hard to get a good picture and the turquoise is actually much darker than this. I can't get one myself because the tattoo ends up looking distorted 




 Yeah, I wasn't referring to the style. The style is geometric. It reminds me of a tribal drawing so that's what I called it 
























 Yeah, I'm not worried about the mail, I know she'll hand that over. I'm just worried she wont give me the tax information. I'm pretty scared at this point but hopefully it will all work itself out. :/ 




 Haha oh man! Gosh darn Vikings. 




 Hi! Thanks so much :) 




 Thanks! 




 Thank you! I can't afford to take any prep courses, so I'm saving up for some LSAT books that are highly regarded online. Preparing on my own makes me a little nervous because sometimes I hardly have motivation to do everything else that's going on, but, I think it'll be fine! 




 That's so exciting! It seems so far off in my future but its really not. I have to take the LSAT this coming summer. It seems totally unreal 




 Well, I live in Green Bay WI. This is really stereotypical, but gamedays during football season are absolutely amazing, especially if you're actually going to the games or just tailgating anywhere near Lambeau. Everyone is so nice. It's like having a huge family who you can drink with and party with and love the Packers with. It is a totally unreal experience and it was amazing to grow up here, and I'm not even that into sports, really!

Football is our religion here. It's not an exaggeration what you hear about the cheeseheads haha. Everyone takes their prom pictures at the stadium, a fancy night out is taking a loved one to one of the stadium restaurants, or a restaurant named after someone associated with the Packers...yeah. Everyone should visit Green Bay on a game day sometime haha 




 This is such a great idea! 




 Actually, I'm still a junior in undergrad. I am pre-law track. Wonderful professor, very dry material. lol 




 As a citizen of Panem, I swear loyalty to President Akeleie. 




 AGREED.  




 Aww thank you so much! 




 Thanks! I'm pretty sure the last book I read was for one of my Con Law classes, pretty boring! haha 




 Thank you!
 




 Thank you! I generally like to think that if someone needs help and I am able to offer some, I will. I think that's a pretty neat trait to have! 




 I'm Maya! Nice to meet you as well! I dont think I ever go without pepperoni on a pizza. 




 Oh my gosh macaroni and cheese. I have to go make some now. haha 




 Thank you! 




 My favorite food by far is lasagna! Unless you count pizza as food, then pizza is my favorite. How about yours? 




 I just discovered this sub recently and I think what you do is pretty great! It makes me happy to see all the gift posts when I'm scrolling through reddit. :) Keep up the good work, all! 




 Mind-boggling, lol. And i know. WHITE SOCKS FOR KIDS ONLY. I can't even keep track of my own when they are fancy-patterned. 




 Red-pillers. 




 Aw that is so cute! I'm so jealous, mine just went away back to school for a J-term class! 




 American here. I'm from Wisconsin. Our overweight, entitled drunk girls are pretty terrifying 




 A sock basket. I soon realized that normal families just match their socks and get on with their lives.

 




 This sounds weird, but force yourself to smile and laugh with other people. Even if you feel dead inside, eventually it becomes genuine, and if you are looking for things to laugh at, eventually you realize there are a lot of things in the world that can make you smile. I use this a lot for my depression, and it helps with other situations too. 




 An "us" night, complete with food, movies, and lots and lots of sex and laughing. We have a fairly big group of friends who are constantly doing things and hanging out, and it's especially bad when everyone hasn't seen each other in a while. He's a good guy and hates saying no to people, so I feel like I have to compete to get his undivided attention sometimes. 




 Congratulations! That has got to feel so good. Sending internet fuzzies your way. Sounds like you've got quite the set-up, at the beach! Nice! 




 Aw, thank you so much! :) That means a lot to me. 
























 Very true, good point! 




 That is a really good point. I feel as though we do need to have this conversation, so I can really test and see if she knows how much damage she has done and whether she is really sorry.  




 So my mom doesnt exhibit all nbehaviors, but she was definitely a toxic parent, and I am dealing with a lot of issues because of it.

I had recently (since this past Christmas) gone NC with her after she flipped out and overreacted, which resulted in her kicking me out. You can read the post [here,](http://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2qd73m/hyperreligious_nmom_kicked_me_out_today_merry/) and the [update] (http://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2qqznd/hyperreligious_nmom_kicked_me_out_today_merry/) I posted afterwards.

Anyway, this morning she called, and I had deleted her number, and didn't recognize it, so I answered. She called saying that she wanted to apologize for her actions and that what she did wasnt right, and that God wanted her to reflect and apologize to me. She told me that she would like my forgiveness, but she understands if I don't give it. 

Here's the thing, though. I was ready to ignore her completely, and to not call her on Mother's Day, her birthday, or on holidays. I wasn't going to invite her to my college graduation next spring because she's done nothing but make my college experience much harder with all of the emotional abuse and manipulation. She's treated me so badly that I cannot just let her have access into my life, or an opportunity to let me down. She's beat on me and has always been much harsher to me than the other kids in my family for no reason. Its just so confusing though, because she's given me a sincere apology, and unprovoked, as far as I know. 

I am starting to feel guilt already at the thought of maintaining NC/VLC after this. And I'm very suspicious. My brother just left to go to boot camp, and I keep thinking that this is a way to get one of her adult children back into her life, since she's got a 14 year old, 8 year old, and a 5 year old, along with a deadbeat husband who offers her barely any support emotionally or financially back home.

I'm just....really hesitant because I don't want to fall back into the guilting, and the manipulation, and the lack of boundaries. 

Can anyone offer some insight about this? 




 Wow, writing a book, especially a book of poetry is something to be proud of! I'm sorry that you couldn't be proud of it the way you wanted to be :/ 




 Yeah :/ I feel you. Thank you for the hugs 




 I scored an 8 and shit like this makes me wonder how I turned out so relatively normal. I should be dead or nearly dead by now 




 My mother is half black, and so I'm a quarter black. This matters to the story, trust me. 

She was talking about how she got the best parts about being both white and black: her lips are full but not too much, her skin is a nice mocha color, she has thick hair but it can grow long, etc. Puke, I know.

I, being 11 at the time, wanting my mother's approval and a link to her obviously superior genetics, asked, "What about my lips, mama, are they nice too? I think the'yre shaped just like yours." And then i smiled at her. 

She looks at me and says, "Hm, well your top lip is pretty thin." My face instantly fell. 

She was always annoyed by my low self-esteem growing up, too. It was obviously because there was something wrong with me that I was just refusing to fix, it didnt come about because of constant shit like this. No, never. Baffling. 




 Wow...this sounds almost exactly like my situation. I was kicked out on Christmas day because my mom told me and my impressionable younger sister that women needed to cook and clean and were not allowed to rest, and the men should sit around and relax all day. When I complained, she flew off the handle. I also have younger siblings, four younger, and it's hard not being there with them to protect them, but they know I love them. It gets better.  




 Yeah, i thought about that one, and I'm just going to keep saying to her that I am only here for my brother and that her hugging/fake praise/whatever other bullshit she pulls is making me uncomfortable. I'm also going to send her a text the day before establishing my purposes and that we don't have a relationship to speak of so she should not pretend as if there were one.   




 I have a family event coming up where my mother (who i am NC with) will be as well.

My therapist told me to treat her like a yapping dog: 

You don't walk into a room where a yappy dog is barking and think "oh no, the dog is barking a lot, what did I do to make it bark??" right? You realize the dog will bark because that's what it does, no matter what you do. You also don't refrain from socializing with the ones you love in a room with a little yappy dog just because it's barking. You're not afraid of it because it's just noise, and it has no power over you. 

This helps me immensely when preparing to go into possible situations where my mom is going to be. At worst, when she decides to hop on the crazy train, it comes off more as an annoyance than a traumatic, emotional event. Hope this helps someone else too :) 




 Good advice, will definitely be doing this. 




 That's a good idea. He lives about four hours away from me, so I have to get a ride into town and then stay with my boyfriend's parents for the weekend. I could try and get him out to dinner with me or something beforehand
 




 All I have to say is, I'm glad I'm not the only one. I'm generally very outgoing and love to talk to people, but I get this "vibe" from people that they don't want to hear what I have to say, or I am the "weird person" in the group after I start talking about something. I'm not sure if my social skills are off or if I have anxiety left over from when my mom would sigh and interrupt me in the middle of me talking about something and talk about something unrelated that she wanted to say, totally just ignoring every contribution I ever gave. Probably a combination of both.

It's actually converted me from being extremely willing to meet new people and have a conversation with someone I just met to me holing myself up in my room and feeling nauseous and scared to talk to people or look them in the eye while im at university. Super awesome, thank you nparentalunit 




 You did the right thing. But remember: he doesn't deserve *better*, he deserves something *different* that suits his needs and desires better. You also deserve that.

Just because you don't want kids does not make you lesser, it just means that there are better people suited to the lifestyle he wants, and the same goes for you.

I know that doesn't make it any easier, and it sucks that you had to give up a good relationship. Sorry that this happened to you :/ 




 You can get yourself emancipated, like everyone else is saying, OR if you don't want to go through the legal process, and you are just worried about the FAFSA, there is an option on it saying that you cannot provide your parents' information, because they are abusive. Usually schools will help you go through a dependency override process, as long as you are no longer living with that parent. If you can live with a friend during breaks or something, I would do that. 

I am going through the same situation right now. During breaks, I live with my boyfriend's parents and work, and for the school year I live off of loans and scholarships and grants. I filled out a dependency override form, and the process was fairly painless. All i had to do was write a statement, get someone not related to me (like a cop, a counselor, or such) to write a statement, and then I got my boyfriend's mom to write one. VOILA! No contact since then. 









 I can only imagine what that child sounds like, and it's making me cringe. That said, I think this is a pretty cute way to announce a pregnancy, unless they made her cry on purpose 




 Haha, I love your flair! 




 That's very true. I love RBN, it's how I found you guys! 




 It's nice to hear from someone who has a fairly "normal" life without tons of vacations. I dont think my bf and I will be able to travel as much as some either but it doesn't really matter. No kids! Thank you :) 




 Haha, I love this 




 So happy for you that you're making it! It must have been pretty hard losing all of that saved up money, but at least youre not in debt up to your eyeballs. Good for you! 




 Yeah, and even though there are posts that have a lot of hate in them and I don't agree with everything everyone says here (that happens when youre an adult in an adult world), I still think we should have a place where we can put those feelings. We aren't evil. Those here who hate kids don't hate them in a "KILL ALL THE CHILDREN!!" way, just in the sense that they're annoying and parents seem to encourage that behavior a lot nowadays. 




 I'm relatively new here, and I just found out that this subreddit actually has a really bad reputation.

I just have to say that surprises me! Even though we have a lot of people who absolutely hate kids period, we have people who are living the CF lifestyle and just wish people who are parents would stop being assholes. And it's kind of a nice little support group when we feel alone or out of touch with the childbearing population.

I have to say that I am so thankful that this sub exists. I was already not feeling the whole having children thing, but this sub helped me to realize that I was making the right choice and I wasn't alone in feeling this way. It's saved me $250,000 and maybe even more than that if I were to have more than one child because I felt as though I was "missing out" or if I would have let the bingo-ing get to me. You guys have saved my life as I know it, and I am so grateful. 

Not to mention, there have been maybe a few examples of parental regret that I've heard of before this subreddit, but I went through the top posts of this subreddit, and I've found so many examples of parents who regret having their kids. I've never heard of a CF person who regrets it. 

So you guys keep doing you! Thanks for being here! :) 




 Haha, well he's a game design major and it's sort of his mecca. I just want to be somewhere where the sun is shining, the people are diverse and weird, and I don't have to deal with these miserable winters. It'll be expensive but worth it. :) 




 Rock on! Aunties/Uncles who spoil their nieces/nephews unite! 




 This is hilarious. I would be a much better pet owner than kid owner. We plan to have furry babies of our own one day :) 




 Exactly! 




 ...between liking kids and wanting kids of your own. I'm not a child hater in any sense of the word. I see a baby at a restaurant and I freak out over how cute it is. I see toddlers running around at a park and it makes me smile. I love babysitting.

But I would never, EVER, have kids of my own. The thought of it makes me cringe so hard. If I were to get pregnant, I know that I would abort it, and not regret that decision. I've had a couple scares before where I was ready to make an appointment. All my girl friends say they couldnt fathom the idea of having a baby now, but they do want kids someday. For me, there is no someday. I don't get excited about the prospect of having kids. Rather, it makes me feel as though the day I give birth to a child is the day I give up my life and my freedom.

I may feel this way because I grew up being a mother-figure to my four younger siblings, and the fact that my own mother was a terrible parent, but it doesn't matter. The reason I feel this way does not change that I FEEL THIS WAY. 

I hate it when people say "I've seen the way you are with kids, it would be such a WASTE if you weren't a mom!" or "You love kids, how could you not want any of your own??" Especially when it's people who I have expressed my child-free feelings towards.

Also, I have a serious boyfriend, and people always say to me that it would be such a shame if we didnt have kids because we are such a good couple. I'm fairly sure we are a good couple because we do things for each other that ease each other's stress as much as we can, and one of those things is that we don't have or want kids. I am 100 percent sure that bringing kids into the equation would change our relationship entirely, and I am not going to give our amazing relationship up. That does not make me a selfish person, either.

Luckily, even though I am only 20, I've met someone who also doesn't want kids, and he wants to marry me and travel the world with me and wants to get the hell out of the midwest and end up in the fabulous city of LA. I cannot say how much of a relief it is to have him. As long as we are on the same page, all the rest of that shit we put up with doesn't matter, honestly.
