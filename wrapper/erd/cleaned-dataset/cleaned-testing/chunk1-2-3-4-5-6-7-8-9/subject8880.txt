 IT'S WHAT I REMEMBER WALT!! 




 I did. Scroll down. 




 Walter, have you ever drank shots of liquid cocaine and Jack Daniels? 
Walt, it was closing time and when closing time happens, legs open.... 




 Da fuck? 




 I agree. I dropped the book when I glanced at the cover and said "What the fuck?" really loud.
Yeah, I took the pic when I dropped it. Someone placed it in the Sci-Fi aisle. 




 What is your impression of the cover art? 




 I fucked a fat chick and didn't know until the next day. Woke up naked in the bed, used the phone on her night stand to call friend, message on phone said "Dial 1 and area code for the number you are dialing", jump up, find phone book from Kansas. 
I live in Tennessee. 




 Long story short : It all started with a bookshelf and naked pics of them both. 




 That is weird as fuck.

 Idea I had a few years ago that crossed my mind. See, you know how DC always fucks up the Archie superhero universe? 
I had this crazy thought about rebooting Archie Comics into a superhero universe.
Riverdale? Big as New York? Archie Andrews?
Well, he is the Fly. The Golden Age,Silver Age,etc. All of the past Crusaders, Shield,Blue Ribbon Comics stuff has happened, but rebooting Archie would have him on par with Spider-Man as the Fly (the rookie superhuman dealing with experienced heroes).

 So anyone whos been on the /v/ board at 4chan. probably knows about Mr. Bones Wild Ride. For those who dont, it was a ride someone made for Roller Coaster Tycoon. It was one of those really slow motor car rides but with a twist. It had 30,696 feet of track and a ride time of 70 real time minutes, around four years ingame time. In addition there were those props of the skeleton holding out his top hat scattered around here and there, as if to mock the customers. Needless to say, there were a lot of passengers screaming I WANT TO GET OFF MR. BONES WILD RIDE!
Now heres where things get really good. Once the ride came to a stop, the passengers found themselves on a long path that took about 2 hours to traverse. Once they reached the end, they found themselves facing a sign that read Mr. Bones says: The ride never ends!
The path lead straight back to the entrance of Mr. Bones Wild Ride. There was nowhere else to go. In other words, they were fucked. Needless to say this gained a lot of popularity on /v/ and people started making their own Mr. Bones Wild Ride. I was one of them and made a version with the ghost train ride. You know the one thats usually a huge death trap. It didnt last as long as the original but it did have a twist. Near the end it launched the cars into a small shed with a sign on the side that said Enjoy your stay! I killed about 20 people with that ride and laughed my ass off as they each went one by one to their graves.
Fast forward a few weeks and I was in Busch Gardens on vacation. I was wandering around trying to decide what to ride. Thats when I noticed a ride that hadnt been there the last time I visited. It was weird because it had never been advertised and there was nothing on the map about it. I figured what the hell and got in line.
Surprisingly the line wasnt very long. I only waited about 10 minutes to get on. It was one of those motor car rides which is kind of weird because they already had one elsewhere in the park. Why would they open up a second one? After buckling in I looked up ahead and froze. There was a giant skeleton up ahead tipping a hat to me with a sign over his head. No I whispered. The sign read Mr. Bones Wild Ride.
I struggled with my restraints but they wouldnt come off. I begged the employee contolling the ride to help and that I had changed my mind but he ignored me. My car started moving and I screamed in terror. Up ahead the track stretched on for what seemed like forever. I WANT TO GET OFF MR. BONES WILD RIDE!

  Barkley: Shut Up and Jam: Gaiden! 

On November 28, 2012 Tales of Game's announced the game's sequel, The Magical Realms of Tr na ng: Escape from Necron 7  Revenge of Cuchulainn: The Official Game of the Movie  Chapter 2 of the Hoopz Barkley SaGa, with a Kickstarter campaign to help fund it. The campaign ended on December 28, 2012, and raised $120,335.

While the sequel will retain the original's self-aware tone, all of the artwork is being created from scratch to avoid copyright issues.

  also wouldn't be an old image that this reporter simply doesn't recognize. Ted Kord has only ever shared a single panel with this version of Booster Gold before -- in Futures End: Booster Gold. That issue saw Booster careening out of control through DC's Multiverse, before ending up "home" in the pre-Flashpoint DC Universe. The armored costume -- generally depicted with an A.R.G.U.S. emblem on it, although not here -- first appeared in the Justice League International Annual #1 in the New 52, meaning that Ted Kord was not a superhero and shared no history with Booster Gold when that look debuted.

It's likely that this Booster Gold is the same one who, in a different uniform, lent guidance and occasional surreptitious assitance to his younger self and his son Rip Hunter during Booster Gold Volume 2. That "Older Booster" was last seen just before Flashpoint during the Time Masters: Vanishing Point miniseries tied to the Return of Bruce Wayne event. That version of Booster would have been the one whose younger self worked extensively with Blue Beetle on the JLI and later the Justice League America.

Currently, the pair of old friends and former Justice Leaguers are working together in Justice League 3000...but that doesn't take place in the "regular" DC Universe, but instead in a similar universe where Keith Giffen and J.M. DeMatteis' humor-tinged, nostalgic take on the Justice League International is the standard. That world is a version of the pre-New 52 DC Universe, but one in which (among other things) Ralph Dibny isn't dead and Max Lord never went evil.

 Our timeline was split in 2000 during the Presidential elections. It was tied, so the timeline split in half causing 9/11 and other glitches. 




 He has the Omni-Gauntlet. 




 That was a good Metal album. 




 Mid-90's Justice League books after Giffen/DeMattis left was more 90's than X-Treme Justice.
It's the forgotten JLA. They went back to space, Nuklon and Metamorpho joined when he had shoulder pads.

Google it. It's a horrible JLA run. 




 Hawk And Doved ended in 1990 or 1991?

 Some but not good X-Titles. Bunch of 90's shit. 




 Right now some Beer Signs and Flags, KISS sealed figures,etc. 




 i have a crapload of Superman books in storage right now. I would have to get back at you when the snow storm is over. 




 Looking for any Nu-52 Superman books, 80s/90s Superman books, Superman figures,etc.? 




 Laserdisc. 




 I moved into a new apartment a few weeks ago. When I opened my closet door, a skeleton popped out.
It scared the ever living shit out of me. 




 Continuity. The basis for a deep story and a working universe. 




 Russia is a slapstick of a country. Why do people hate it so much? 




 Or Mid-Life Crisis hipsters. 




 Over-Man from Grant Morrison's Animal Man, Capt. Marvel from Kingdome Come and the League Of Batmen from the DC Multiverse. 




 And Guns N Roses. 




 I play Titanfall on the PS4. You think Sony would give me a PS4?

 They called him Capt.Marvel in the comics but not on the covers. I should know, I read them. 




 I read that in Scrawny Armed Rob Lowe's voice. 




 This sounds suspiciously like Jackson,Tennessee 




 In a very public forum, I would never link my resume with private information. 
I was asking a simple question if anyone has information for careers in the Memphis area. Not to throw attention to employers, but to throw my curiousity into the 901 area.  




 If only I was a good cook. I'm mostly interested in anything IT, security or even anything at the Fed-Ex Forum or a hotel. 




 Now that's adventure. Was you high?

 A cosmic entity created bythe One-Who-Cannot-Be-Named.  Every alien race interprets the Eye differently by their concept of judgment. Our human concept is an Eye or a witness.... 




 Dr.Light's silliness was Silver Age also but retconmed by Identity Crisis? The accent could have been an off-panel retcon. 




 I'm white but can't swim. Fuck deep water!

I know they are not worth much, but it's a classic rookie. That is what I like about this hobby. 




 Then why did he speak with an Anerican accent in his first appearences?  The writers knew he was Australian. 




 Capt. Boomerang had an Australian accent in 80's Suicide Squad. I like to think that it was Zantanna who mind warped him to speak in that accent. 




 The Eye was one of the first cosmic entities in comics. Since the Eye is Public Domain, I consider hin in a role similar to the Living Tribunal/the Watcher in my universe.
"Eye witness the Multiverse unfold into anarchy....." 




 Speed force doesn't exist in a Antimatter 5th Dimensional Multiverse. Imagination does. 




 I swear I remember talking to her on the phone years ago. 




 How do we know if the 5th Dimension isn't lying to us? 




 Explosions. Beer. Chickens. Sounds like McNairy County to me. 




 Who said it doesn't exist? Maybe it's safe in the Antimatter Multiverse? 




 She's just hiding her bruises. 




 The homeless person because I have no idea if they are homeless or not.
I have trust issues with humanity. 




 I need that Punisher book. I been collecting the 80s/90s stuff cause it's so cheap now!

 I do not like it when I am angry because I say things and do things normal people would not do.
I just do not give a fuck during anger and that terrifies me. 




 I am very strong Agnostic and nothing can change me. I have no proof, I have no evidence and therefore I do not know if there is a heaven or hell or even a god. 
Even though I wish the end of life would be a happy ending, I don't trust it. Maybe it is trust issues I have with humanity as a whole and how the greater good in someones mind could be the bad.
Another reason : Cults, the Tea Party and politics. All I can do without. 




 The consequences will never be the same. 




 Doesnt matter what color hair, still nice looking either way.

 Mr. out_of_my_mind89, what you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I've ever heard.

I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.

 Let's review this shit.

How does a city reuse a former basketball arena when the team moves to new digs across town? 
 It was a rough place - the seediest dive on the wharf. Populated with every reject and cutthroat from Bombay to Calcutta. It's worse than Detroit.

And what if, hypothetically, that arena is shaped like a pyramid?
This? Why, I can make a hat or a brooch or a pterodactyl..

 If youre Memphis, you fill it with a 535,000 square-foot Bass Pro Shop, then sit back and wait for the apocalypse to arrive.
Bad news. The fog's getting thicker.
Built in 1991, Memphiss Great American Pyramid has been empty for over a decade, looming on the skyline like a bad idea conceived after too much cocaine. Numerous proposals have tried to revive the 32-story pyramid but none had the $191 million backing of Americas most audacious retailer.
And Leon is getting laaaaarrrrrger.

In addition to the sales floor, the store is like a Vegas-scale Bubba Gump outpost including a cypress swamp with live alligators, a bowling alley, a restaurant, an observation deck, taxidermy museum, and a hotel. If these photos arent enough to convince you of humanitys impending doom, there are more images over at Bloomberg Businessweek. The store opened today.
 There's no reason to become alarmed, and we hope you'll enjoy the rest of your flight. By the way, is there anyone on board who knows how to fly a plane?

 Just a curious party trying to obtain some older DLC or games to fill up the old xbox drive. 




 MARVEL STILL OWNS THE 4 AND XMEN!

 How they get him to hold still for the photo? 




 Mr.Rogers. 




 Infinite Special Ed. Minions = A World ruled by the Potato Pack. 




 Savage Dragon still kicks ass after years of Erik Larsen putting him in real time.
Also 1963 by Alan Moore. It's a damn good book that was over printed but it was fun. 




 Capt.Atom, Capt.Adam, Dr.Manhatten, Firestorm, the Nuclear Family, Deadman,etc. 




 It's like DC went B-Movie in this book. 




 How about a sequel involving a cloned ninja George Washington who leads an army of robot Bill Clintons on motorcycles? 




 Guess he was making his tower collapse...if you know what I mean. 




 What comics you need? 




 Rock 103 Memphis now play the Ramones and the Sex Pistols. I shit my pants when I heard Breaking Benjamin and Saliva on there the other day. 




 The League Of Crosstime Ted Kords would like a word with you.. 




 25 percent of my faith in humanity was restored. 




 Savage Dragon was a good book. Better than some of what was published then. 




 I'm as giddy as a schoolgirl right now. 




 Cracked existed when you was 10. Was you sheltered? 




 What is the squared root of 1,000,000? 









 Let us petition this. 




 Dan Dido is just a shit writer circlejerking his Silver Age child agenda. 




 At least Valiant was readable unlike Youngblood. 




 And it's Earth -616.34 where Teen Hulk and Obnoxio The Clown lives. 




 Mr.MTV by Nothingmore? 









 BASEketball. 




 Used to enjoy playing Magic The Gathering and Heroclix. What broke me? 
Douchebag Fedora fat guys who spend their life savings on cards/figures that I wouldn't buy for a grand and their smirk better-than-you attitude.
It's now a game of who has more money than you and has sucked the fun out of playing. 

....Don't even get me started on Warhammer... 




 Risky name. 




 Magnum condoms for my dong. 




 I once found a pile of human shit in a Wal-Mart dressing room.
 
























 You have any complete runs, omnibuses, absolute editions, Marvel Essentials,etc.?

 A Roku. You will be watching metric fucktons of movies. 




 Lick it before you stick it. 




 Wishmaster. 




 So one Saturday morning a few years ago I was in my car driving to get breakfast. I had a headache that morning and decided to take some 
Headache Powder to get rid of the pain

OK, so I forgot the AC was on and the powder blows right into my face making it look like I was doing coke and when the powder hits my eyes I run off the road.As my eyes opened, I swerved to the left RIGHT IN FRONT OF A STATE TROOPER.
So, I missed him and he turns around. Little did I know I had a few empty beer bottles I had in a bag in the car and it smelled like I had a party in the passenger seat floor.
He turns his lights on and here I am driving down the road with powder on my face and empty beer bottles I was supposed to throw away. 
Luckily I explained, got my car searched and everything was ok. 




 Geocities, Yahoo Chat, IGN, TOTSE, Textfiles, Napster, AOL. 




 Pussy. 




 Was you expecting Shakespeare? 




 Pussy. 




 I'm sorry but Game Of Thrones. I like it but some people get fucking nuts over a tv show that was a book written years ago.
I know that I will cause some controversy, but the fans of the show ruined it for me. 




 Oh hai mark 




 That one-eyed Dog Daryl found in the church in Season 4 of the Walking Dead. The dog didn't get eaten by a zombie, he just ran away.
Imagine the adventures of a one eyed pirate dog in the zombie apocalypse. 




 I understood that reference. 




 Well, take out Frayser, Whitehaven and Orange Mound out of the equation and BAM no crime! 




 Kinda like Selmer,Tn. 




 But Denver has legal pot! 




 Was you expecting Shakespeare? 




 You need any early 80s X-Men for some them DC stuff? 




 Was you expecting Shakespeare? 




 Dr. Fedora. Leader of the M'Lads. 




 It's just an illusion. 




 Explain to me why DC hasn't put a Blue And Gold series but Prez gets a new book? 




 I read this as Milf vacation in Memphis and was like "my type of woman"  




 No Sandy Hook stories? 




 I understood that reference. 




 Try listening to the numbers stations in the middle of Antarctica. Spooky.

  Creepy? I don't remember it being creepy. 




 Young Nic Cage not older nutty Nic Cag. 




 Is that the old Memphis Comics And Records location? 




 Jenna Jameson? 




 Someone told me I look like Nic Cage but I have no idea. 




 I have at least 100 back issues of books dating back to the 50s. Various Marvel books including some Uncanny X-Men books that are bank (1st Dazzler, Dark Phoenix Saga,etc). I wanna sell these to a collector but so hard to find.
Craigslist is nothing but spam and I don't enjoy eBay because Paypal. Memphis who buys these comics in cash? HALP! 




 They're on eBay now. 




 They skip the creepy fedora and the arrogant attitude.

 Was she a Saigon whore? 




 That is fucking sick. 




 Share these books. 




 Would I were a nazi shirt around? Of course not, thats silly. Besides it's spelled "wear" not "were". 
I also own a bible. Does that make me a Christian? No. It's because I regard it as a form of history. Same as Mein Kampf. 
I love history. I love reading about it. I own many books about WWII and the Civil War. Does that make me a bad person because I fucking love history? 




 I own a copy of Mein Kampf. Does that make me a Nazi?
No. I just love history. 




 Is his fedora ok?

 Your comment and submitter history is a circlejerk of Bernie Sanders. How much are you getting paid? 




 Nope just trades,omnibuses and entire runs. Im a reader not a collector. 




 Was it too Extreme for you? 




 Oh fuck. How I remember when WMKW TV 30 in Memphis would show that on Sunday nights. 




 Give them to me. I would rather accept then and give them to my nephew than you throw them out.
Saves an asshole from finding them and selling them to an uneducated collector. 




 You're so Extreme it hurts. 




 Was you expecting Black Keys? 




 Around Memphis in West Tennessee.
THE SHIT PART OF TENNESSEE. 




 Saga? No, that's Elektra Saga. 




 Let's say you're wanna watch Aliens or something on Netflix that fateful day in April. You find the movie, click on it and BAM : oh Hai mark.
Best prank ever. 




 When he was a cast member of SNL 1980 he used his real voice.
I never even knew he was on SNL until Comedy Central aired reruns of that shit season. Same with Robert Downey Jr on SNL. 




 You're such an expert Mark. 




 Did a Hastings close down or something? They have the same back issue shelves. 




 This from the UK Transformers book? 




 Barry Allen returned in Final Crisis so it's pre-nu-52. 




 LET GO OF MY PURSE! I DON'T KNOW YOU! 




 That comment was coloring book material. 




 6 on Maximum Carnage TPB but Im shit out of luck because my Paypal BS. Wish you took money order. 




 I saw. I laughed. I want to move on that street. 




 'Murica has a president not a governor. 




 I once farted in front of a customer..then I was fired. 




 Ah the old 5 dollar Walmart bin flick by Lionsgate. 




 Ahh a mafia ran phone number lol 




 Capt. Atom. Too underpowered in mainstream DC.
He should be more Dr.Manhatten/Pre-Crisis Earth 4 Capt.Atom/Earth 75.45*67 Capt. Adam. 




 I actually prefer Byrne,Ordway,Jurgans, and Simonson Superman than the Nu-52 bullshit. 
I totally forgot Perez Action Comics run which I hold in the same regard. 




 If he was forgotten then why was he in the first few pages of Avengers/JLA? 




 President buying Magic The Gathering cards and Heroclix. 




 They are better than that Black Keys hipster shit. 




 [Holy shit. It's the real life Lockjaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockjaw_(comics)) 




 Yep. And I was a laughing 15 yr old kid and now I'm a 36 yr old laughing man. 




 DAE remember that infamous number from the 90's? 




 Should have said All Lives Matter. 




 They are first printings for the direct market. DC never reprinted Crisis until they collected it in 1996.  




 You mean 1996. 




 BatMecha. 




 Lacking in personality? Depends on the writer. The good writers see him as Conan the Barbarian with wings.
Just imagine a Blue Beetle type series like Starman. 




 I have a really weird Spawn-like feel to these photos.  




 Fuck Earth! 




  April Fools!

I once told a April Fools joke in September once.. 




 Rock hard. 




 I havent had my dick sucked in 4 years....ladies...? 




 Your best friend is a evil bastard.

 That I wish we was friends again because I miss her. 




 Did he live in a can? 




 I bet he lived a Semi-Charmed Life. 
























 You live near the U of M area or Bartlett by any chance? 




 Live between Memphis and Jackson,Tn. All I can say is stay away from East Jackson, Orange Mound and East St.Louis.
Anyone know about Paducah? 




 So what about McFarlane or Shadowhawk or Erik Larsen or Mark Bagley,etc.?
 




 Uh no. Pick up Suicide Squad 1 from 1987.
Nu-52 Suicide Squad is shit. 




 Someone has been watching UHF. 




 Faith No More remake? 




 I know it's weird as fuck to say, but when you live in the south and you hear it every single day you end up saying it yourself.
I had to ween myself from saying it. 




 This is the first generation model that came with a hard drive in 2009. 




 Taco Bell? 




 Nope. Can confirm. Friend works at a Coca-Cola bottling plant and he got wrote up for eating Taco Bell cause they are owned by Pepsico. 




 If you work for Coca-Cola you can also get fired for eating at Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. 









 You just watched this on Netflix too? 




 37? 




 Savage Dragon is still good. P.S. I enjoyed Shadowhawk. 




 Fuck no. I'm talking about the comments in this thread. 
A potato ban is necessary with the shit attitudes and neckbeardisms. 




 Grandparents. Honestly, Microsoft still updates it and 8 people in the United States still use it. 




 Saying go get a job is easier to say than to find one. 




 For a cheeseburger? 




 Link? 




 Teethy blowjob makes my dick sore. I got a few and my cock was sore for days. 




 Potatoes offend me. Somebody ban them.

 How far from Corinth or Tupelo was this store at? 




 The fedora is strong with this one. 




 I got banned from working at every Wal-Mart on the planet.

 Blade returns in Capt.America : Civil War. 




 http://www.neckbeard-news.com/2014/04/wisconsin-man-tips-waitress-with-fedora.html#.VZ6qq19Viko I'm dying. 




 I concur with this gentleman's statement. 




 Must have been me. I farted. 




 I may have said this long ago but I really think I ate breakfast with a serial killer once. 




 That's the thing about DC. They only care about the now instead of the when and what. 
You have tons of cosmic entities and artifacts that the DC Universe writers don't use. 
I mean DC has the Human Squirrel and Fireworks Man.  




 It also explains where these superheroes come from. No conscious  being appears out of nowhere unless there is an explanation for it. 
It's a really powerful device and not one writer has even delved into the backstory.
 




 Nah. Phantom Stranger isn't obscure. But I have a fan theory about one obscure DC hero. I really do think this makes sense.
Dial H For Hero : That dial is a cosmic multiversale construct on the same level as the Time Knife, the Book Of Crime, the Omni-Gauntlets,etc.
The Dial possessor switches places with a hero on Earth H. It's a very very powerful multiversal device on par with the Ultimate Nullifier. We just haven't seen the full potential of it yet. 




 You're god damn right. 




 I hope you burn! 




 Say My Name. 




 What is your favorite obscure DC character?
I have two that is obscure : Detective Karp and Kana the Shadow Warrior. 




 I'm old school. I prefer Karl Malone or Charles Barkley.
Shaq was a horrible 3 point shot though. 




 I really think you shit in a bag to throw the police K-9 unit away from your meth lab.
Trust me. It works. 




 Filthy bastard! 




 You sick fuck! 




 Eugene here knows what started the dead to rise. 




 You monster! 




 I kept a Redbox movie once. 




 Hitler was your real dad. Him and Ava never committed suicide. 









 I converted just for the jokes. 




 I'm never gonna give you up. 




 In each and every one of us lives a spooky skeleton. 




 They are minerals. 




 I was playing casual MTG few days ago and every guy (natural fedora wearing neckbeard) I play against always talked shit about my deck and bragged about how much they spend,etc. 
It turned me off really quick when you sit down at a casual game and the fedora wearing fuck is playing is competitive deck he uses on FNM.
It's pathetic and annoying. 




 Bolivar,Tn? Absolutely the shittest town in Tennessee. 




 Really damn good. 




 Someone got their fedora on too tight today. 




 Another reason why I don't play MTG. It's more about the money instead of the gameplay.  




 Was the company Subway? 




 Holy fuck. 




 I thought of Devo De-Evolution when I saw that tat. 




 Didn't know this store existed. 




 wonder if people that find them will give them back to him.

The fedora is strong with you. 




 New Lobo is the New Coke of DC Comics. 




 This offends me take this down. 




 I got fired for farting and was wrote up for being rude.
Then I was fired.

 He's public domain so anyone can use him. 




 The Fedora is strong with this one. 




 urls of the cams?

 House is a lazy doctor.

 




 The cover collection is fake. The art is too modern and even the comment section agrees with me. 




 Fucking the pillows again, Bobby Digital? 




 Squash Relish. It's good. 




 It's so bad that the art and writing is fucking hilarious. Because Liefeld. 




 [If only you seen the pornhub comments](http://pornhubcommentsonstockphotos.tumblr.com/image/78483299274) 




 Two words : Freedom Fries. 




 Was that guy a zombie or just a survivor? 




 1) Fuck the outside. I live in a cesspool of a small town where crackheads vagabond about. Wide-eyed from the hit of a crackrock and asking for Camels and a ride to "that fat bitches double-wide on the corner"

2) Fuck reading. My local Library is a hellhole of religious lit, 50 Shades Of Sticking Things Up Her Ass and Vampire erotica. No Phillip K. Dick. No more Stephen King. But tons of Needlepoint books.

3) Fuck visiting friends. It's tough at 36 keeping up with your friends when half of them are dead, married, in jail, out of state, wives won't let them talk to you or their god damn kids are keeping the poor bastards busy. Fuck visiting relatives. They are all in the same description as above.

4) Fuck volunteering. Half the nursing home is dead, nearest hospital is 20 miles away and all the retarded people got nurses to wipe their potato asses.

5) Fuck taking classes. Our shit tech center is overfilled with assholes and the teachers don't fucking teach. They chit chat and help you sound out words but NOOOOOO they cannot help you with muthafucking algebra.

6) Fuck learning a new language. Bitch, I know Pig Latin and a few Spanish words like Taco, Burrito, Aqua, etc. All them Mexican words with silent letters n shit.

7) Fuck writing a book. Bitch I got writers block,

8) Fuck new hobbies. I aint got no money to buy god damn RC Cars and hacky sacks and muthafucking bows n arrows and shit.

9) Fuck marathons. Bitch I got asthma.

10) Fuck cooking. Around these parts, you ask somebody to help you cook and you end up with a detective at your door asking you  questions about meth and shit. Muthafucka, do I look like some damn Walter White? Bitch, do I own a car wash?

11) Fuck driving the elderly. Those old fucks always forget what they want when you take them to Piggly Wiggly and shit. Always calling me at 3 am asking me to change their depends and shit. Bitch, they can change themselves.

Suggestions my ass!! 




 Fuck Tumblr. 




 I doubt that is going to happen  with the porn subreddits.

 You in Missouri by any chance? I'm near the Bootheel and the radar looks horrible.
They got rotation in Obion County Tn right now near me so I guess it might get rough. 




 Get ready to be seriously disturbed by that movie. I read about it and even reading about it is disturbing.

 The name of that one album escapes me. Too similar to Metallica Black Album.
 




 You grew up to be a male stripper because of that song? 




 Google that disc. I'm serious. 




 I want that disc. EDIT : That's a developer disc. How the fuck you get your hands on that? 
You might have a rare disc worth bucks on your hands. 




 Actually Cannibal Corpse and Deicide is heavier. 




 Opeth is the shit. 




 You did not mention Slayer, Pantera,Anthrax, Megadeth, Testament, Iron Maiden or any good metal.
Slipknot is ok. First album is meh. Iowa is the shit. Vol. 3 is ok.
 




 Was the farm near Jackson,Tn? I heard about a German POW prison that was located around there.
