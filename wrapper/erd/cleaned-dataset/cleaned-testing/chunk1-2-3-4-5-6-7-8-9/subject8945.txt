 Can't tell if it's the baby disappearing because of abortion or the dad disappearing because of the stereotype. 




 Girl Talk. It's a dude who does mash ups of rap and hip hop. Of recommend giving "All Day" a listen. 




 Teenagers will get way too wasted at parties. Be the friend who stays sober and laughs at the stupid things drunk people do and protects them from the dangerous things. 




 Tell that to Jackson 
























 I stopped talking to my ex girlfriend, because even though I wanted to be friends with her, it was making my life hell because I still wanted to be with her. That, and I started reading and exercising more.

 I hate Time Warner as much as the next guy, but I feel like there's a scumbag reddit meme in this title. Something along the lines of: 

CORPORATIONS AREN'T PEOPLE 

UNLESS ONE EMPLOYEE CALLS A CUSTOMER A CUNT AND THE WHOLE COMPANY IS TO BLAME 




 Modern Family. Those characters were spot on Episode 1. 
























 I might not be remembering exactly right but I believe Robb said something about how he didn't think Karstark would stay at the Wall of he was sent there. Because Karhold is so close, his allies would have just rescued him and taken him back home.

 Good stuff mate just remember, Pavlov did classical conditioning not operant. "Skinner on Spinning" would be more fitting.

 All my fucking friends are getting fucking cars and I'm still riding the fucking city bus 




 I'm Haitian. 

It is absolutely true that Haitians will ruin your garage sale. I have seen multiple occasions of Haitian people coming to a garage sale with a box, collecting $50+ worth of stuff in it then setting it in front of you and saying "5 dollars?"
