 I know about research on field-effect transistor, electrochemical, enzymatic and microbial sensors, but never heard about anything cheap, convenient and sufficiently reusable. Not that it can not be done, of course.  




 I like the design. There are other more interesting things to measure besides radiation. Say, lactose or gluten for those who are sensitive.  












































 You could try to analyze what makes you feel better or worse. Were there specific combinations of foods and activities before a bad flare up? What about patterns in your blood pressure? Were there seasonal allergens in your area at the time? Stress and emotional events in your life?  Aurametrix does this type of analysis automatically. 




 There used to be a freely downloadable database compiled from users' submissions:  http://www.upcdatabase.com

Many vendors are selling UPC collections for various prices, the more info you need about the items the higher the price. 

There are many free or cheap apps for iPhone and Android that provide product information after scanning barcodes 




 Moringa tree?
It has little cream colored flowers, is fast growing and blooms when it is 8 months old.

 They eat krill in the wild. It tastes salty and without much umami flavor. But as they swallow them whole, the taste is not that important anyway. 




 How did you come up with the name Aquaria? 
Is it plural for aquarium  - as your proteins look like they are placed in transparent tanks? Would be nice to be able to "feed" these creatures with ligands and dietary minerals, to see some action.  




 What do you think about breathable chocolate without calories - like inhaler from Le Whif. Will it ever take off? 







































 Symptoms of Internet/Mobile addiction:
- Pain and numbness in the thumb and wrists
- Dry eyes or strained vision
- Back aches, neck aches and severe headaches
 -Checking social networks while driving or in other inappropriate places 














 To know what you are about to put in your mouth, would you use gadgets like 
SCiO (a tiny spectrometer and allows you to get instant relevant information about the chemical make-up of just about anything around you) or Peres enose (that sniffs out spoiled food)? 
























 Untreated IBD might develop into cancer, but chronic unmanaged cases of IBS are mostly responsible for severe deterioration in quality of life. If left untreated for too long, it can be associated with conditions requiring surgery - like diverticulitis.  




 Could be.

Bread, Cakes, Whipped Topping, Jams, Ice cream, creamy sauces, chocolate, Noodles ... all these products have emulsifiers and are on the list of problem foods for IBS - as contain combinations of gluten, FODMAPs, lactose and other sugars. 




 EMI seems to be useful in some but not all cases - text messaging, for example, seems to be useful in diabetes but not body weight control. 

What kind of existing and future sensing technologies could be the most useful and effective?

How to navigate the fine line between nagging   intrusiveness versus being helpful and nurturing? 




 Applies to both new and old (aged) runners. As marathons are more popular than ever, the  average/median time slowed to its current snail's pace - from 3:30 in the 80s, to 4:30 or so. The record for the slowest median time is over 8 hrs. 
I saw headlines like "how sluggish newbies ruined the marathon" more than 10 years ago. Yet, Greg Meyer (winner of Boston Marathon in 1983), said If it wasnt for the run-walkers, you wouldnt be finishing in front of anybody. 




 The article recommends to take walk breaks, that's all. The frequency of these breaks depends on the individual. Some are better in listening to their body than others and don't need such advice, but others might benefit from it. 

Edit: Is there a better way to redirect posts instead of punishing the poster? As I understand, Reddit takes away rights to post anything new or repost after a post was downvoted, so I can't repost it. 

Also, if you read the comments to this article, some "real runners" did find it interesting - "My own experience of running competitively (25+ years) bears out the evidence in Hottenrott's study.  The walk breaks enable you to change your movement pattern, refuel/hydrate, and reset your thinking." 
























 Makers of beer do need microbiologists with sensory training. Brewmaster microbiologists can easily identify strains of yeast or bacteria just by smell.

As this paper showed, microbiologists could also help with brewery design, especially microbreweries  - as building materials, spatial area, indoor conditions  such as airflow, humidity, and personnel traffic - are all very important.  



















 True, you can use only ingredients you want. Traditional breads and pitas don't have emulsifiers. Italian chocolate Domori doesn't have them either. 


































 Most of these genes were acquired over 50 million years ago and are involved in metabolism (lipid, amino acids, etc), immune responses, protein modification and antioxidant activities.

 Snakes and crocodiles are very efficient digesters - so we would probably look like them - no need to have teeth as the food can be swallowed whole, heads and jaws adopted to swallow objects bigger than the head, no need to be picky as we would eat nearly anything, then survive for months without food. Our social interactions would be somewhat different too, as we do use eating as a way to socialize. 
























 This study looked at serious infections requiring hospitalization, not something like cold virus that we get over 50 times during lifetime. Besides, another study by [Dean Keith Simonton](http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/faculty_sites/simonton/p175wmain.html) showed that sickly kids might be more likely to become geniuses "We cannot always assume that good goes with good. We dont necessarily have the smart, stable, and fit on one side and the dumb, unstable, and sick on the other.". 

 [This study]http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0124005#sec013)
also says that "The cognitive ability might be directly affected by infections or related immune responses; however, heritable and environmental factors associated with infections might also influence the associations"

"Lower cognitive ability may be a risk factor for acquiring infections," 

"Studies have indicated that immune related genes might be implicated in cognition, and individuals with genetic liability towards a lower general cognitive ability might also be more genetically vulnerable towards infections." 




 What do you think about new technologies utilizing aromas to influence the way we eat - like food inhaler Le Whif and Aromafork with its set of 21 aromas to "trick your mind and forever change the way you perceive flavors"
