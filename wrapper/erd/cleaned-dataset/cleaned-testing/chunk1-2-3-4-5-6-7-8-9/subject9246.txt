 Mine generally have to be in omelet form. Scrambled is a weird texture, and if the yolk and whites are separate, I can't stand the taste. Mushroom, tomato, onion, pepper, and cheese omelet is my favorite. 

As a kid and even a teen, I hated beans, but since becoming vegetarian I have tried them again and opened up to them. 

Ice cream is obviously delicious, but milk has always been my beverage of choice. 

I looked for my main nutrition book to see if I could find any more information, but it's back at my parents' place. When I go home for thanksgiving I'll see if it has anything else to say about it and if it has anything about nutrition and depression. 

Where are you looking to attend and what do you want to major in? Anything science tends to do that until enough information, research, and studies are available to come to a definite conclusion. In all of my classes I have been taught omega 3 is beneficial. 

Me too, I just searched my schools courses to see if any went over nutrition and depression/anxiety, but I wasn't able to find anything.

I've started searching online for local psychiatrists/therapists, and it is slightly overwhelming.  

Respecting my likes and dislikes is something I need to work on. I don't mind going to the bar and being social, but I'm kind of past the drunken college party scene. 

I know you said changing your diet helped, but are you also currently taking any medication or seeking counseling? (I apologize if you've already covered this, I'm on my phone and I'm not sure how to see previous posts while typing a reply. :/) 




 Such a simple phrase, yet that would probably solve half the problem. Thank you for sharing.  




 I keep telling myself it will pass, but it hasn't.  




 I eat eggs occasionally, but have always been super picky with how they have to be cooked, otherwise I don't like the taste. 

The best sources for protein are definitely from meat, dairy products are also good and grains have some protein, but not much. I get most of my protein from dairy products and beans. I absolutely love milk and skim actually has more protein than whole milk.

If you're interested in studying nutrition, go for it. There is a lot of information out there and you could easily purchase books and learn a lot on your own. Just make sure they are credible. Nutrition is just my minor, but in my spare time I try to learn as much as I can.  




 Nutrition is one of the things I'm studying in school, and what you're saying makes a lot of sense. I've been pescatarian (vegetarian but eats seafood) for about 8 months now, and I'm sure I have several deficiencies based on my diet that hasn't helped my depression.  




 Exactly. If I could pinpoint it, then I could fix it. 

I'm sorry you're in the same boat. I wouldn't wish this feeling on anyone.  




 The word mate makes me smile. 

Have you found anything that helps? 




 Definitely not the answer I was looking for, but it makes sense.  




 Are meds really the only option? I was on some meds for about two months and I hated it, haven't been on them in almost a year and I really don't want to be. :/  




 Definitely going to print that off the next time I'm in the computer lab.

Thank you.  




 Words cannot describe how much what you said is what I needed to hear.  




 Thank you. :)  




 I also really don't want to be put on medication, and when I went to my family doctor, that was the first and only thing she did. 




 I know for me to actively seek out a therapist is probably the hardest thing for me, but probably the best step for me as well. I've admitted to myself that something isn't right, but if I admit it to someone else, that would mean I can't pretend that I'm okay anymore. 

One of my biggest fears is being told by a therapist that I need to just get over it - I know how ridiculous that sounds.  




 Which is more helpful, seeing a therapist or a psychiatrist?  




 I've thought about seeing someone, but I'm really bad at communicating how I feel and opening up to a stranger. Was it hard at first for you to open up? 




 Thank you. :)  




 I'm finding more and more uses for the blowtorch. Just used it to make Smores in my kitchen. Best investment ever.  




 Used this recipe http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/emeril-lagasse/vanilla-bean-creme-brulee-recipe/index.html and used an entire vanilla bean instead of only half. Struggled with the blowtorch part a bit though, in the pic you can see some of the sugar wasn't completely caramelized, but on other ones I ended up burning it. Any suggestions? 









 I used to have a hedgehog named Popcorn, and this makes me miss him. This is adorable. :)  




 In the basement of Robinson is also an old butcher area and the freezers are creepy.  




 Even if the save battery dies, they are super easy to replace.  




 I feel your pain, the only internship I could find was nonpaying, but what makes it worse is I need the internship for graduation and thus I am paying for the credits.

I pay to go to work everyday... 




 What to expect: They will prick your finger before you can give blood to test your iron.  




 Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs - any good? 




 Call at age 5 to explain that there was nothing I could do to stop my grandpa and uncle from committing suicide, and to not waste the next 17 years trying to please everyone and feeling like a failure when I'm not successful. Because 1. It is impossible to please everyone, 2. Pleasing everyone won't bring my grandpa and uncle back, and 3. Even if people seem happy on the outside, it doesn't mean everything is okay on the inside. 




 I got glasses for the first time in 2nd grade and made the same discovery - I told everyone because I wanted to make sure everyone knew that trees had leaves. 
























 I'm not good at showing emotions so I just ate them and said how great they were.   




 My sister thinks I'm going through a phase and am crazy, yet at the same time she is one of my supporters.  




 Exactly. My parents keep vegetarian burgers, lasagnas, etc in the freezer for when I come home to visit. It's nice then even though I don't live with them, they want to make sure I have quick and easy access to food when I'm around.  




 I've been a fish eating vegetarian (pescatarian) for about 10 months now and the hardest part is family gatherings especially around holidays. Today is my family's Christmas get together and for Christmas we do a lot of finger foods: meatballs, ham rollups, veggies, etc. One of my favorite foods are my mom's ham rollups. I could easily eat a whole platter. I have never asked my family to change their recipes or make special accomodations for me - it's never been an issue finding something to munch on. Well today as we are setting the table, I notice something different, my mom made vegetarian ham rollups. Instead of wrapping the pickle and cream cheese spread in ham, she wrapped them in a spinach leaf. They tasted so good, even some of my meat eating family were snacking on them, I actually had to make sure I got some because the regular ham rollups were being ignored. 

This small gesture meant a lot to me, and I just wanted to share with you how awesome my mom is.  




 Inconceivable!  




 I'm sorry. I suppose I have some pretty understanding friends/family. I've received some grief from meat eaters, but I tend to brush it off and move on. I also found not mentioning it helps. Many of my friends don't even realize I'm pescatarian. Got to be stealthy. ;)  




 I'm pescatarian and it makes it easier. Make fish or order fish at a restaurant is easier than ordering vegetarian or vegan. My family loves that I'm not full out vegetarian because they can cook one meal everyone will eat. 




 WARNING: Has the emotional stability of an 8 year old.  




 Do you still need six and seven? 




 I know the feeling. I actually deleted my Facebook a couple months ago and it was the best thing for me. 
I've gotten closer with my few close friends, I've stopped worrying about what is going on in the lives of people who I used to know and comparing them to myself. I've even had some old friends reach out through phone calls and texts to see what's new in my life. The things I would want to post and sometimes did post, I now turn to my friends about and they've been a lot more helpful than I'd ever imagine.  




 As a Stephen King fan, I am super jealous. I own maybe ten of his books, but my goal is to have a Stephen King bookshelf one day. Thanks for sharing. :)  




 You are correct. Anyone can call themselves a nutritionist, but a dietician requires school, internship, and then an exam to become certified. 

Source: Once was a Dietetic major. 




 I will. Thank you!  




 Thank you. 




 Thank you for sharing what you went through. It's nice to know others have gone through the same thing. 

I've started searching for a good psychiatrist near me. 

Funny you should mention reading. Growing up I'd escape inside a book daily, but with school and work I haven't found time lately. Well last night I pushed everything aside and read just a few chapters of a non school related book. I've missed that.  




 I've contemplated driving recklessly into a tree. 




 To me up north was always the UP. 




 Mt pleasant is not up north....is it? 




 That's why I generally resort to saying "I'm tired" or "I'm stressed"
 




 True, I wouldn't want to put someone through that.  




 Thank you so much for taking the time to respond to all my questions. It really means a lot. :) 




 I've gone to the free services on campus before, but they don't really know how to deal with things like this. You get x amount of free visits and they are more for homesickness, help adjusting to college, balancing work and school, and various things like that. Their advice to me was "get involved on campus" and you'll feel better. Not really helpful in my case. :/  




 Thank you. I'm not ready to give up yet.  




 Getting hit by a car is another one that crosses my mind sometimes.  




 Have you had any negative side effects from taking GABA? 

Thank you for sharing what worked for you. :)  




 Same here.  




 Couldn't have said it better myself.  




 I work out when I can, could probably do it more often though. 

Slightly afraid of AD side effects, but also against the idea of them in general 
- I don't like taking medication in general.  
























 It has "Schick" written on the case and the end of the handle. I've done some research and I think it is a Schick Krona, but not real certain. I've been lurking on here for awhile, doing research before I went and bought my first razor, but then I found this while on vacation and impulsively purchased it. Is this a good choice for a first razor, or should I look for an alternative?  









 I've found that keeping my hands busy really helps me. Lately, including tonight, whenever I feel restless and in need of a distraction, I grab some hemp and make a bracelet. Something about the different knots and the repeating motion is soothing and helps distract me and calm me down. 




 Sounds exactly like my past two days. Hope yours goes better. If you need someone to talk to, I'm a good listener.  




 I may regret this, but all jokes are welcome.
I've been feeling down all day, so if it makes me laugh - I'm game. 




 I'll pick someone at 9:00pm Eastern Time


*Update

Thank you everyone for all of your jokes, they have brightened up my night. I was unable to just pick one, so I've selected ClassyAssBitch and johannvaust. I've messaged them and waiting to hear back.


**Update ClassyAssBitch has received their gift card. Still waiting on johannvaust 




 I tried to make some a couple years ago and forgot to grease and powder the pan. Trust me when I say that is the most important step.  




 I live about a mile from campus and walk, unless the weather is really bad or I'll be on campus way past dark. I hate when circumstances arise where I feel like I need to drive. I end up having to leave earlier because otherwise I won't find a spot, or students walking will cause me to sit at a stop sign for a solid 5 minutes. On top of that, there is the problem of feeding the meter every two hours so I don't get a ticket. Driving to campus really is more of a hassle than walking.  




 My roommate and I are both vegetarians. When we need our fast food fix we go to BK for the veggie burgers. Asking for a whopper with the vegetarian meat is my favorite.  




 I'm 22 and still have some servers treat my friends and I like shit because they think college kids tip poorly. I have always tipped upwards of 25% or more for good service, but if a server is terrible - I'm not afraid to leave as little as 5% tip.  




 I'm terrified of all dogs. I'm that person that would jump in front of a car to avoid a dog - big or small. Growing up I wasn't around dogs, and thus they make me kind of nervous. Maybe they lady wasn't breedist, just uncomfortable. Just a possibility. :)  




 I deleted my Facebook awhile ago and traded it in for linkedin. I'm connected to people still and in a much more useful way.  




 If I recall correctly, it ended when he went off to college.  









 Did that when I moved into my first apartment. Luckily the maintenance man was a genius and prepared for all the idiot college kids moving in and had his truck loaded with towels and some magical spray that more or less killed the soap bubbles.  




 One of my best experiences was at Wendy's. There was an older gentleman working and I asked if it were possible to have a sandwich with no meat. Many times I've been charged full price for a meatless sandwich. This guy went out of his way to get me a deal. Punched in the items individually and put it on a Jr sized bun, was about 70 cents and I think I had cheese on it as well.  




 Books.

I have a thing about owning the books I read, so I hardly go to the library. I have a favorite used bookstore I frequently visit and if I have the intention of purchasing 1 specific book, I leave with at least 2 others.

When I buy a house, first thing I'll do is convert an entire room into a library. So at least my hoarding will be in a central location?  




 I'm paying my own way through college. I'm a full time student and I work 35-40 hours a week. If I had the option to have my parents pay for my school, I'd accept in a heartbeat.

For the most part I'm indifferent to people who have parents that pay for their college. I've met a lot of different people in school, some that have their school paid for through loans, through scholarships, by working, or from their parents. How someone pays for school doesn't define them though. A good friend, coworkers, etc. wouldn't change how they think of you because of this.

The only time I've had any issues with someone who has parents paying for their school, is when they act spoiled about it.

As long as you don't walk around bragging about it, it's nothing to be ashamed of. 

TL;DR
I think they are pretty damn lucky.  




 I'm assuming you use a wood burning tool and then just spray it with clear polyurethane and it stays nice? Will it ever rot or should it last forever (or a lifetime)?  




 Did you text the number?  




 Thought I had it figured out, texted the number and apparently I'm not as good at math as I thought I was. Trying to figure out where I went wrong. :/  




 Maybe I'm reading this wrong, but were you the one to find your mother and discover she had died? As a five year old that must have been pretty traumatic and could have played a roll in not having you attend the funeral.  




 Glad it turned out alright! :)  




 I'm not an ASL major or minor, but took ASL 101 for kicks and giggles, and really enjoyed it. Had Kevin and he is awesome. I need a few more credits before I graduate in May and decided to take ASL 100 with him because I enjoyed his class so much.  




 As a broke college kid, I love Christmas for the same reason. That and small used book stores. I saw some people recommended going to the library, but there is something about having books of your own that feels so good.  




 Sometimes people cave. It's a personal choice. My family made prime rib for dinner last night. My older brother made it (an amazing cook) and it took so much will power not to eat any. Every side dish was vegetarian though, so that helped. 

I've caved, I know I'm new to this whole thing, and I accept I'll slip up sometimes. My reasons for being pescatarian aren't moral reasons, so if I slip and eat meat I just start over and try again. 

Tell your fiance you love him, but were really hungry and what you eat is your decision. :) 




 I'm sorry, that puts a damper on the holidays. Hope you have a merry Christmas and enjoy the time with your family despite grandma trying to trick you. :)  




 I've taken my own food with me places. All summer I kept vegetarian canned soup/pasta and microwaveable vegetarian items in my car because I never knew where I'd be when I was hungry and didn't want to burden the person I was dating with having to feed me. When I go to bbqs I always bring my own veggie burgers. I never expect someone to make accomidations for me, but appreciate it when they do. However I didn't grow up vegetarian and made this change after I had moved out on my own. When people order pizza, they generally get half a pizza with what I want on it. I'd suggest talking to your fiance's family and asking about being more vegetarian friendly. Maybe they don't understand it or don't know what to make. 
























 I'm graduating and leaving town, or I'd say I'd go. Are you working or taking classes over the summer? If so, you could ask coworkers or classmates to go. Make a few new friends :) 




 Shaving legs in the sink is doable, just not ideal. I'll try switching the water tomorrow when I shave to see if that helps. 

I have not used pre shave oil. 
 
I'm not use to having to pull my skin so it is stretched, so I'm probably not doing it 100% the way it should be.

Update: using the lower faucet helped with the lather. Ended up knicking my underarm - trying to hold the razor, pull the skin, and shave with basically one hand is harder than anticipated.   




 None!? 




 Buy a tube or raft to go tubing down the river. Best free (aside from initial investment of tube and any alcohol you bring) thing to do on a hot summer day. 

This isn't on campus, but it is a fun thing to do during the summer in Mt. Pleasant.  




 I just started using DE razor and I use it in the shower, takes a bit longer but I think that's just because I'm still learning.  




 With the lather I think I just used too much water. I shave in the shower and it was easy to dilute the soap too much. 

Yes they were problem areas I had before. Issues with razor burn and irritation. 

Oh and I attempted to shave my underarms and I'm having trouble getting as close of a shave there, legs are much easier.  




 My list of things to try is expanding quickly, but I'll definitely add that to my list :)  




 I picked up some of that soap and I noticed a huge difference. :)  




 I bought some new soap and it definitely made a difference. I don't quite have the lather down. There are a couple areas that I'm having trouble getting a close shave with though. I still haven't cut myself yet, but I'm terrified of the day I do.  




 Try looking on Amazon. Also they are better if you leave them out and they get a little stale. 

Edit: After a quick search on my phone, it looks like peeps don't ship outside the US. Not sure on shipping regulations from the US to Australia, but you might be able to have someone personally ship you some. 




 I've lurked here awhile and did research on other threads and found Astra mentioned quite a bit my newcomers, so it seemed like the safe and logical choice to begin. Can I get Taylor of Old Bond Street cream in a store, or is it online only? Thank you! I stumbled across you guys a few months ago, and instantly became interested. I already can't wait for my leg hair to grow back so I can give it another go. :) 




 No worries, I'm posting in a man dominated subreddit. And this is the first time I've posted something and outted myself as female. So I would have assumed I was male as well. 

Thanks for the thought out reply! I'm nervous to try feathers because I've heard they are good, but also easy to cut yourself with. So far I like Astras, but I'm excited to see what else is out there and what works best for me. :)  




 Thanks! I tried to pay as much attention to what I was doing and what did or didn't seem to work. I had noise to a minimal so I could listen to how it sounded as I shaved. If I get razor burn in an area, how should I treat it differently the next time?


Edit: I actually don't have any hair on my face. I used the razor to shave my legs last night and this morning I used it on my underarms.  




 Thank you! I am in the US, I'll be sure to stop by Walgreens and pick some up to try. :)  




 First shave was pretty successful! Didn't get quite as close of a shave as I was hoping for, but didn't cut myself either. I'm sure with practice I'll get better. :)  




 Do you have a favorite? I purchased the razor, blades, and brush one at a time as I had the money, but I was impatient and just bought the soap I could find at Walmart.  




 I hadn't used it before and didn't realize until after I tried lathering that it wouldn't work. :(  









 As someone who digs through applications and hires new employees, if I had to do this it would take up my entire day. I get so many applications where I work, I can't even look at every single one. If you care enough about getting the job, give the company a call to check on your application, but don't be a pest about it.  




 I love your tagging system. I always buy books faster than I can read them, and then some get lost in the shuffle until months later I realize I still haven't read them. I may have to steal this idea. :)  




 There are several women over at /r/wicked_edge that have found a better way to shave.  




 Thanks! I'll try those. :)  




 I apologize for the misunderstanding. :)  




 I've been wanting to pick up drinking scotch. Do you have any recommendations on where to start? 




 You have too much good beer in VT to not keep trying. Here's a pointer to enjoying beer, I've found that when I pour the beer into a mug, it tastes better than in the bottle. Pour the beer just right so you get a bit of a head on top. Also, there is a wide variety of beers. If you don't like the taste of an IPA, you may enjoy a Porter more. Where I'm from, there are some stores that sell create-your-own six packs. I recommend finding one of those, and purchasing six completely different styles of beer. Try each one (not all the same night) so that you can see which ones you prefer. Keep note of what you do or don't like, and then you can ask for beers with similar tastes. 




 I love me a good beer. I'm currently visiting VT and there are some really good local beers I've stumbled across, but I still love me a pint of PBR on occasion. Everyone likes to bash it, but I think it's a good beer in it's own way.  




 That is extremely helpful. Thank you!  




 What's the best way to clean it? I've read a lot of people do a vinegar and water mix, is that a 1:1 ratio? Do you have any recommendations for blades?  
























 Bought this razor on a whim without knowing what type it was, after searching online I've found that it is a gillette slim made in 1966. I did a quick clean up just to make sure it twisted and turned in all the ways it should, and everything looks good.

Currently I use a schick krona (which I really like), but I've noticed that the gillette slim is a bit heavier and has a shorter handle. My little sister has shown interest in DE and I want to give her a starter kit for Christmas. Would the shorter handle and the heavier razor be okay for a female beginner? Or should I keep looking for something with a longer handle and lighter weight? 









 You absolutely can profit from working on the island. It's all about knowing how to budget and save - same as any job anywhere. The Jamaicans were some of the hardest working people and mostly friendly. 

Source: worked on the island the past six months and brought home a good chunk of change.  




 If by garbage trucks you mean horse drawn vehicles. 




 The test is very much flawed. I only took one year of Spanish in high school and wasn't very good at it. The test placed me in 202 and I ended up dropping down to 102 and not receiving retroactive credit because I choose to take a course below what I tested into.  




 That's awesome, can you use other fruits aside from apples? Thanks so much, I'll have to try this.  




 Thanks :) 




 How do you know how much to use? I put some of the peels in my apple butter.  




 Make it very similarly to apple sauce, but you cook it longer and make it a smoother texture, comparable to an apple jam or apple spread.  




 I worked with a Welsh girl, a Scottish girl, and an English boy this summer in America, they all sounded completely different. Although if I met someone from the UK I'm not sure I could pinpoint where they were from. 

 




 Awesome! Thanks for the response. I'll probably crack one open later today anyways, just wanted to make sure there wasn't anything else I should look for.  




 Everything on the outside looks like it worked, do I need to open one to make sure it is good on the inside?  









 I saw that as well. I think for now I'll just use something cheap since I won't be actually using the pot to cook in, just for the final canning process. Thank you! 




 Dated a kid named Sean for almost four years, called him Seen the entire time. First time because I thought was how it was pronounced, after that it just became a pet name. 




 Currently work at a coffee shop and I say the same thing, it amazes me how confused people look when they try to figure out how to put cream and sugar in their coffee.  




 I would have looked at a thrift store first if I could, I love them and they are my go to - especially for cooking things. However, as I mentioned in an earlier comment, I am currently living in a place with limited resources. No thrift store, no big chains, basically I need to order it online. I did find someone that is willing to let me borrow a stock pot of theirs though! So for now I'm doing that, but first chance I get I want to get my own. 




 Thanks! 




 Only reason I was looking for stainless steel instead of aluminum is because you can't cook acidic things in it. 

For the actually canning process, there is no difference in what container you use then? As long as it covers the jars and you can heat it on the stove?

I'm in the process of getting a book :) I'm currently living somewhere with extremely limited resources, so I've been relying on friends, family, and internet advice. 

I've been told to start with something easy the first time I can, does it really matter seeing as how I'll still have to go through the same canning steps? My plan is to make apple butter this week and can that as my first item.

Thanks again for all your help! 




 I am new to canning and am in the process of gathering all the equipment I will need. I've ordered [http://www.amazon.com/Norpro-6-Piece-Canning-Set/dp/B0000DDVMH/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8qid=1381440440sr=8-1keywords=canning+tools] and I've ordered a rack for the bottom of the pot, however I still need a pot. I have a flat stove top so I want to avoid the granite ones. I started looking at stainless steel stockpots and found this one [(http://www.amazon.com/Alpha-Heavy-Stainless-Steel-Savezoneusa/dp/B002GE5GYI/ref=cm_cr_dp_asin_lnk)]. I've heard good things about it, but is it really necessary to spend 60 dollars on a pot. Does anyone have any other suggestions of good ones that maybe are a bit cheaper? Thank you! 




 These look amazing Nolan! 




 Could you post the list of books you received?  




 Has a book been choosen? I'd love to participate.  




 I'm in the act too old group. :/ 




 That's why I loved hoodies in high school. But then they made it against the dress code to wear them. :/ 




 Applying for everything isn't wrong. I'm completely white, and applied for a scholarship my senior year of high school that was supposed to be given to an African American female that played sports and had a good gpa. I was a perfect candidate for the scholarship, except for the whole being white issue. My principal, who was black, told me to apply anyway because the foundation rather give money to someone than no one and hardly anyone applied for this scholarship. I ended up being one of the people who received the scholarship. I was honest on my scholarship application and checked the box saying I was white. I know this doesn't explain why it isn't racist, but several other people in this thread did a good job of that already. Just wanted to encourage you to apply to any and all scholarships, it isn't wrong and you might get lucky. :) 




 Made a world of difference! :)  




 I just shaved my underarm again and I tried more passes in different directions, this seemed to help, but I'm still not 100% satisfied with it yet. I keep trying to shave the way I used to with my old razor, but that isn't right.

Yes the lather helped with my legs. I ended up doing two passes against the grain. I've tried and tried to go with the grain, but it is the most awkward thing to shave away from my body.  
























 When I worked in a bakery, we always used a water bath and baked them between 250-300F. Never had any problems with cracking.   




 I'm 24(f) dating someone 36(m). Nothing wrong with it. Two consenting adults dating is a very normal thing.   




 I've been a coffee drinker for awhile,  but am just starting to really get into coffee. I have a Chemex pour over that I enjoy, but still purchase ground coffee from local coffee shops. I saw on the wiki page that Hario was mentioned as a good under 50 grinder. I received the Hario MM2 http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B004QWMAII/ref=mp_s_a_1_4?qid=1419718375sr=8-4pi=AC_SX110_SY165_QL70 for Christmas.  Will this work for a pour over,  or should I exchange it? Thanks! 




 Received a Kindle Fire HDX for Christmas from my parents....I can't change the background because it has ads.  




 He won't let us go to bed without one last kiss right before falling asleep. And first thing in the morning I kiss him.  I love that we start and end each day with a kiss.  




 Lady shaver here.  When I first started I did short strokes and took it slow,  especially around my knees and ankles. But now I find that I can get a good shave with just 1 pass ATG on my legs. I do one long stroke to shave the length of my lower leg, and one long stroke to shave my thighs. I still tend to do short strokes on my knees because I have a tendency to cut myself there. I love my razor and I'll never go back. I've never had as close of a shave as I do now.  




 How does this shit work? Are regular Starbucks employees expected to perform cream art in peoples drinks? Is this difficult? I don't get it. Seems like a huge pain in the ass, day in-day out. Even if this is an indie place or something, do you charge more because goons expect you to draw shit in their coffee drinks?

I worked at an independent coffee shop for a while and started teaching myself how to do latte art. It isn't difficult, just takes time and practice. We weren't required to do it, but did it because it was fun, competitive with other baristas, and made the work day more interesting. Most customers don't expect it, but it's great to see the smile and surprise on their face when you hand their coffee to them. No extra charge.  It doesn't really take any extra time. You need to pour the milk into the espresso anyway, why not do it in a fun way. :) 




 Wow. Someone seems to have a stick up their ass. The food industry isn't for everyone, and obviously you aren't cut out for it. Some of us do enjoy the long days and take pride in what we do. Some culinary schools are a waste and some are actually really good. It's amazing networking, it gets you in a kitchen cooking faster than working up from a dishwasher to a chef, and you can be introduced to so many more techniques and varieties of foods than working in a restaurant because you aren't limited to just the theme of the food at the restaurant. 




 Love that you're watching Gilmore Girls. 




 Same. I get that it sucks to have someone steal your clothing, so I always return hoodies, hats, etc. Typically the guy is so surprised that I'm willing to give it back that he gives me one for keeps. I now have a shelf full of basketball shorts, tshirts, hoodies, and hats that are from exes.  I don't tend to wear them unless it's a sports team or something that I'm into. 




 That's how I love mine. I put them in a crock pot with some butter, mustard,  and some seasonings.  Let it cook on low for a few hours. They are nice and tender but not mushy. So good!  




 Mod Podge is typically a waste of money.  Use liquid Elmer white glue and water. Do a 2:1 ratio.  Mix well. Several art students and craft store employees have encourage people to use this cheaper method that works just as well. 




 My first DE razor was a schick krona and I loved it. I just bought my little sister a Parker 29L for Christmas and although she hasn't received it yet, it does have a nice long handle that gives a good grip.  




 Awesome!  




 Fair enough.  




 Nice. I've been keeping my eyes out at garage sales and estate sales too, just in case there is anything good. 




 I've seen a range of prices. At this same shop they had a gold razor that looked like a double edge, but only had one edge to it and had little comb things sticking out - it was about $20. They also had some travel ones with a case and other little things in it, but were upwards of $30 so I passed on those. 




 Thanks! It's the second razor I've purchased. Both have been at antique stores. Unless I'm specifically looking to purchase a certain razor, I'll probably just continue purchasing randoms at antique stores and other resale shops. Seems to be the places to get the best deals :) 




 I used a toothbrush and some soap to do the initial clean, some scrubbing bubbles, and then rubbing alcohol to kill anything that was left.   




 It adjusts the blade so you can get a more or less aggressive shave. 




 If you don't mind me asking, what settings do you use? 




 Looks like I'll have to play around with it :) 




 Female here who doesn't shave her face. I'm assuming same thing goes for legs and such. :) 




 Thanks!  




 Will do! Thanks :) 




 Awesome advice! Thank you :) 




 Thanks :) 




 Thanks! 

I've never used a razor with adjustable settings. Where is a good starting point? 
























 Is your almond milk one you buy off the shelf and is shelf stable until opened?  I think the date on those are when it can't be sold anymore.  But once you open it, it's only good for a couple weeks?  




 I made one with strong iced coffee. I cold brew and then if I drink it by its self dilute to taste. For the smoothie I used it undiluted,  with frozen bananas, Greek yogurt and chocolate protein powder. Bit higher calorie, but filling. I had borrowed the protein powder from a friend, next time I'll probably just put a little bit of cocoa powder in it or maybe some peanut butter.

I look up recipes online all the time,  and then I play around with ingredients on my own too. If I have a bunch of random leftover ingredients that might go well together,  I try it. 


http://simplegreensmoothies.com/
I've gotten some good ideas for recipes here.  


Edit: I've seen people on this sub use PB2 a lot, haven't tried it yet. But from what I understand it's lower calorie than peanut butter and could be used in smoothies as well. 

Smoothies can get high in calories pretty quickly,  but I don't eat breakfast. I figure I can have one up to 400 calories without messing up my meals and snacks for the rest of the day. And if I know I won't be able to eat I'll make a more filling higher calorie one. If it's supposed to be a slower day,  I'll make a lower cal one so I can eat a lunch as well. 

The sugar amount can also get high very fast. More greens and just a little fruit can help keep it down.  




 I work in the service industry as well.  It can definitely be hard to find time to eat,  let alone eat something healthy.  I've begun making green smoothies with Chia seeds the night before so I can grab it as I walk out the door. In my experience most places allow you to keep a beverage near. And it can be a lot easier to grab a quick sip than to eat a snack. 

I make mine with spinach, coconut water (one that doesn't have added sugar), banana,  pineapple,  and Chia seeds. Mine tend to be between 200-300 calories depending on what fruits I switch up. They are typically spinach heavy with just enough fruit to sweeten it a bit.  And the Chia seeds help make it more filling. 

I also have been packing sliced vegetables and homemade granola bars or half a sandwich.  If I have a few minutes for a snack,  I eat the veggies. If I'm lucky enough to get a little lunch break, I eat the sandwich.   




 I count both. I typically plan my dinner first and then work my way backwards. I pick my snacks for the day and my lunch based on what's missing in my dinner. My dinner is typically my biggest meal of the day and tends to be either high in carbs or protein.  




 A lot of cereals are fortified with iron. I believe rice Krispy has 50% of daily recommendation.  Fortified iron doesn't always get absorbed the best, but if you eat Vitamin C with it, it increases absorbtion. So for breakfast you could eat cereal and OJ. 

My boyfriend's daughter is 7 and picky and doesn't eat meat, and doesn't eat enough non meat sources with iron. She recently went to the doctor and was told her iron was very low.  I looked up recipes to make granola bars high in iron. That's an option, but also a bit high in calories.  




 I eat plenty of fish/seafood in general. Love that stuff :) 









 Hadn't even thought about sodium in deli meats. I'll definitely be checking that now. Thanks!  




 I tend to switch up what I eat each day.  :) I eat tuna maybe once a week, or even once every two weeks. I appreciate your concern though.

Tuna was a last second addition to the sandwich,  my boyfriend had eaten about half a small can of it for his lunch and I've been trying to eat some more protein,  so I threw it on my sandwich.  :)  




 Started tracking calories about a month ago and try to eat between 1200 and 1300  day. 

Made this with:
Whole wheat sandwich thin 100 cal.
1 oz deli turkey 25 cal.
2 oz canned tuna 60 cal.
Coleslaw 33 cal.
Spinach 2 cal. 

221 calories 
25g carbs
3.5g fat
24.5g protein 









 A couple years ago I would have said no more than 5 years older or younger. Now, I've been dating a man 12 years older than me for almost 2 years. Things are going pretty great and I'd love to spend the rest of my life with him. 


We are in slightly different parts of our lives, but I'm not far behind.  He has his career,  I'm just getting into mine. We both have bachelor degrees. 

 Biggest difference I'd say is he is divorced and has a daughter,  but I know several people my age that have kids and are single/divorced. 

For us, the age gap isn't a deal breaker.  




 Thank you! I will look into some videos. I do have a full length mirror that I could probably use to check form.  




 I'm just starting to think about lifting weights. But I don't really have access to a gym. What are some good exercises you could do with these dumbbells?  Can you get good results even without all the fancy equipment a gym would have? Thanks!   




 I'm really glad you posted this. I'm just starting and my starting weight/height/age is almost identical to your starting  numbers. Very motivating and inspirational.  You look great!   




 http://thenourishinghome.com/2013/08/fruit-nut-grain-free-bars/ I've been using this recipe for kind bars. It's nice because it's very customizable.   




 Not sure what this is in reference to. Maybe you are being sarcastic.  But dietician is the correct term. Anyone can  call themselves a nutritionist. You have to have schooling, internship,  and pass an exam to call yourself a dietician.  




 I haven't personally, but a friend of mine has and said it was good. You could always cut back the sugar a bit if you think it'll be too sweet. I've also seen variations for mint chocolate chip and also peanut butter chocolate.  




 http://www.browneyedbaker.com/girls-love-their-chocolate-chip-cookie-dough/ 




 Completely missed that connection.  My apologies.  :) 




 Went to school in MI. We celebrated 100th day. Also MI is Midwest.  




 Thank you!  I had a lot of fun with it.  Definitely something I want to do again :) 









 I should have dropped the flour to 400, but I didn't.  I had to add about a tsp of milk to help it come together.  But it was great. Rolled out nicely.  Baked perfectly.  And tasted good. Tonight I'll attempt to decorate with Royal Icing for the first time.  




 Thank you! Trying the recipe tonight :) 




 Do you chill the dough before baking? And on average how many cookies do you get from this recipe?  




 Had to get drug tested at one of my restaurant jobs. It was a 5 star place though.  




 I've had the half med rare half well done burger request before,  as a cook I just put a weight on half of it so it cooks faster. 
























 My mom recently told me she'll mix tuna and cottage cheese and eat it on romaine and it's supposed to be really good. Put a little seasoning on it too.  




 That sounds delicious!  Do the low carb tortillas taste good?  









 Dinner is always my biggest meal. SO and I like to eat dinner every night together and his calorie allowance is a lot higher than mine. We usually compromise with a 500-600 calorie dinner.

Breakfast is around 200 - 300 calories.

Lunch is about 400 calories

If I have any left over I'll eat a little dessert or have a snack between meals. 

I aim to eat 1200 to 1300 calories a day.  




 5'5" SW: 165 pounds CW: 152 pounds GW: 130 pounds


My first goal is to get to a healthy weight. Once I get below 150 I'll no longer be overweight.  So close! 


Then I want to continue to around 130, but that's not a set number.  If I feel and look good at a different number,  then that'll be my final goal weight.  




 Try eating the BRAT diet. It's bananas, rice, applesauce,  and toast. Even if it's just half a banana, see if you can keep just a couple bites down.   And stay hydrated.   




 I'm PMSing and bought a bag full of chocolate truffles today.  But I haven't eaten a single one!   




 I've lost a large sack of potatoes. 




 You look great!  And I love your glasses :) 




 If you order a steak blue in the US. It's less cooked than rare.  




 Holiday Inn expresses usually have some sort of continental breakfast right? Last time I traveled I believed they had things like yogurt, hard boiled eggs, English muffins. You could easily track those things for breakfast. Then bring or purchase salad mixing and healthy sandwich items for lunch. Try to limit eating out to just dinner. Or eat out for dinner, but only eat half. Save the other half for the following day lunch.  




 Being told I look fine and don't need to lose weight.  I started 15 pounds above normal weight and now am only 5 pounds away from not being classified as overweight. I hope to lose an additional 20 pounds after I reach normal weight. That'll put me in the middle of the range for my height. Friends tell me I'm being silly because I look fine. But I'm overweight,  they just don't see it.  




 You've been together for 6 years and still haven't met his son and he hasn't met your parents? Leave. If he has any relationship with his son, and hasn't felt the need to introduce you after 6 years, he has no plans on long term commitment.  

I'm (24) dating a man who is 36 and has a 7 yr old daughter and ex wife. I see his daughter almost every week, and I've met the ex wife. I'm currently living with my boyfriend, so an introduction to the ex seemed reasonable seeing as how her daughter lives with me when she visits her dad. 

As soon as things started to get serious, I met his daughter.  In my opinion 6 years is a very long time without meeting his son or your parents.  




 I knew I was posting too much! Figured I'd get discovered....small towns....


I pretty much knew who you were,  but post history confirms it. :) 




 My boyfriend likes to eat doesn't care about counting calories. We like to eat together though. We will start planning a meal based on what meat we want. I may only eat 4 Oz serving while he eats 6 oz. Then we always have a decent size serving of veggie. He'll throw some cheese or butter on his. And then we add it some sort of grain. Once again he may add extra sauce or cheese or just a bigger portion than me. 

Basically we eat the same thing just slight variations that are easy to do as you go along.  




 You're welcome! I really love the versatility of it. You can change it to your preferences quite a bit. :)  




 When I need a crunchy snack I slice sweet peppers into sticks and munch on them.  Very low cal and you can dip them in a little sauce and still keep the snack under 100 calories.   




 This specific one has almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, chocolate chips, old fashioned oats, Chia seeds, ground flaxseed, rice krispy, honey and almond butter.  




 I switch back and forth between http://thenourishinghome.com/2014/05/mock-kind-fruit-nut-grain-free-bars/ and http://blog.myfitnesspal.com/no-bake-granola-bars/ recipes. But I always vary a bit different than the recipe. I switch up the nuts, seeds, and fruits a lot. But stick to the total amounts of fillings and I stick to the liquid amounts, otherwise it won't bind properly. The no bake recipe is a tad sweeter, but good. If you like coconut, the kind bar is really good, also not quite as sweet which can be good. I make mine in a 6x8 pan because that's what I have. And cut them into 8 rectangles. Wrap them individually and keep them in the fridge. My boyfriends daughter who is 7 and picky loves them both.

 I really liked it with the goat cheese. I actually used a tomato basil goat cheese to give it a bit more flavor.  




 I like to get bagel thins too. 110 calories each and the everything bagel thin is amazing for sandwiches too.  




 I try to eat between 1200 and 1300 calories a day. I tend to snack throughout the day and eat a big dinner. 

The pasta dish consisted of: 
1.5 cups Spinach Fettuccine (190)
.5 Oz Tequila (34)
.12 cup milk (18)
.25 cup Turkey broth (9)
Sweet pepper (15)
1/9 cup feta cheese (20)
3.5 Oz chicken (96)
.5 Tbs fake butter (45) 

Total for the day:
1232 Calories
135g Carbs. 48g Fat. 83g Protein.  









 You're welcome!  




 I didn't realize they lasted so long! :) 




 I have a couple cookies and cream pudding pops in the freezer. 110 calories a piece, and helps fight off a period craving. Just stick a popsicle stick in them before freezing. So yummy. :)  




 http://blog.myfitnesspal.com/holiday-recipe-remix-spinach-goatichoke-dip/ I made this for superbowl Sunday and thought it was pretty good.   
























 I used to order the medium boneless wings....and eat most of them....that's about 15 wings at 80-100 calories a piece depending on sauce.....I knew it wasn't great, but didn't realize how bad it was... 




 What exactly are naked tenders? 




 I haven't been to Bdubs since I started 1200 calorie lifestyle.  When I used to go there, the amount of food I ate was ridiculous.  Any suggestions for menu items that are tasty and won't completely throw off my day? 




 Thanks!  




 I'm currently working as a cashier and to calculate my TDEE use sedentary.  I'm starting a new job in a bakery pretty soon though,  should I switch to lightly active to account for the extra calories burned while working?   




 I like lambics! I'll keep an eye out for it. 




 It sounds good! Do you have any specific recommendations?  




 I am 24F 5'5" SW: 165 pounds CW: 148. 150 was my first goal, because that's what puts me at a normal weight.  It was only 15 pounds,  but being able to say I am no longer overweight is such an amazing feeling! 


I've been tracking everything on MFP and have been eating 1200-1300 calories a day. Took me 77 days to get to where I am now. And I'm hoping to continue to my next goal of 135 pounds. 


Reading everyone's posts on here has been a huge help and inspiration. 




 I'll plan it out either right before bed or first thing in the morning. I've been learning to leave about 200 spare calories just in case I need an extra snack at some point, or when dinner comes and I want to put extra cheese or sauce on my food. If I still have that 200 calories before bed, I'll have a beer :)  




 They make little 80 calorie packs of Nutella. They are meant to be used on the go, but I like them because when I measure out a tablespoon,  I can't accidentally put a big round tablespoon of Nutella on my plate.  




 I'm trying to eat about 1200 to 1300 calories as well,  and have found that /r/1200isplenty has helped.  









 In Wisconsin you pick from a touch screen  what seat you want.

 Just received an email, the 7 for 27 is now. You can buy online or in stores I believe :) 




 I'm 5'5 and currently 151. We got this! :)  




 You don't want them soaking forever,  but these were fresh and crisp and seemed to hold up well.  




 Romaine hearts :) 




 You're welcome! Good luck :) 




 I'll have to look for them next time I go to the next town over. My tiny town has one grocery store and they don't have them.  




 I'm glad you still enjoy it sometimes :) 




 Romaine lettuce, don't try iceberg lettuce. When you buy romaine a head of it isn't round, it's long and narrow and each "boat" is a leaf. I'd post a picture but I'm on mobile and don't know how to post a pic in comments. Google romaine lettuce and look at pics if my rambling doesn't make sense :) 




 Bison meat is so good! 

It's buffalo meat. 




 We used ground beef prime rib burger, cooked it, added onion, and mixed in some canned enchilada sauce. And seasoned it with whatever my SO threw in there, he is the spice man. 

I mixed corn, black beans, and canned tomato  green chilis together and heated them up.  This was meant to be just a side dish, but I threw some on top of my meat as well, and mixed a little bit of shredded Mexican cheese on top. 

Calories came to 509. We aim to keep dinner between 500 and 600. Without the shell it would have been 444. And the meat we used wasn't lean, so probably could have shaved a bit more calories off if we picked a different meat. But I was still under calories for the day so I was happy with the meal :) 

Edit: Numbers. ... 




 I'm a baker....I used to eat fresh baked bread for lunch, by itself. I've cut back, but I'll never be able to ditch bread completely.   




 I love shells and bread and all the calorie dense carbs. I do enjoy a good taco salad, but I can't abandon my shells completely.  I ate all the lettuce boats first and saved the shell for last.  




 Enjoy!
