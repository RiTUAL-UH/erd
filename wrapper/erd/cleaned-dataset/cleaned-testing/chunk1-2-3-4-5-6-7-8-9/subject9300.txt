 I have little knowledge on building PCs but my friend does I found this design on reddit and I want to know if it will work without anything else (besides a monitor keyboard and a mouse).

Thanks a lot  
























 It is indeed :)
but did you have to buy anything not listed for it to run? 
























 Hi this is my first time building a PC an I am wondering how important are monitors?  Do they have to be comparable with certain parts or will any monitor do?  

I'm building a PC using the parts mentioned in this video + the extra parts in the comments could someone please recommend me a monitor to use.

 Thanks a ton man 
























 Hi I am building a gaming pc using Pc part picker and Logical Increments and I was wondering what you guys think of this build?

Will it work and if it works how fast will it run?

Im already maxed out on my budget but any improvements where I could end up spending less would be appreciated.

Thanks,

 I am currently building my PC (most of my parts havent arrived yet).  I got my monitor and I used an HDMI cable to attach it to my xbox 360 in order to test it out.  The xbox graphics and display just looks horrendous on the monitor but it looks fine on my tv...  Should I be worried about how  it will look when im using my PC.

 I'm building my first PC and I'm wondering if these parts are all I need for my PC to fully function.  Am I missing anything?

 Hello I am building my pc based of the great build at http://www.logicalincrements.com.  The website recently changed the recommended graphics card from the Asus Radeon R9 to the Gigabyte Geforce GTX 660 and I was wondering which one would perform better for gaming?

Gigabyte Graphics card:http://www.amazon.com/Gigabyte-PCI-Express-Displayport-Graphics-GV-N660OC-2GD/dp/B00942TK8I/?tag=logicaincrem-20
