 Delete alien blue. Download Ruby For Reddit. It's WAYYYY easier to navigate. That's what I use for mobile 




 I don't watch tv a lot. When I do I watch, like, sponge bob or something. But I have seen a couple of old tv series and I don't think they are that great. I think that the tv series now are even worse though. They are just boring to watch :P 




 Why? 




 Haha that was me! 




 WHAT IS IT!!!! I'm old enough to know! We had our sex ed already! 




 We'll then. 




 Okay!!!!! 




 Probably. I'm not doing anything 




 What's that? 




 TWINS!!!!!!! 




 No, you creep! 




 Oh, and you won't be able to read any other book for a month because of the trauma :) 




 I can see why. 




 What's that? 




 Okay, well, how many twelve year olds do you know that do drugs and drink? And we can't be friends with your gamer tag, anyway.
 




 No. I actually like archery and do not strive to be like Katniss. 




 I do. But I only browse subreddits that don't have . ..... Adult content. 




 
Black ops 1, cod ghosts, terraria, minecraft, the walking dead video game series, etc. 




 I do not look at that adult stuff. Sometimes I do if it's not about, like , sex or whatever . But it's not like I intentionally go to bad subreddits. I never click "random subreddit" because I know what could happen. 




 I know that. I also know that r/watchpeopledie is not something I want to browse. 




 2002 may 




 I concur  




 Yes yes yes but NOOOOOO 




 Nothing 




 I have never watched it, but have been planning to. On school days, I wake up at six, walk to school, walk home, do homework, go to soccer, come home, eat dinner, shower , then go night night and repeat. Since I'm on break or on the weekends I visit my moms house the most I can, come home Sunday, go to sleep, play xbox, back to school. Consoles are only allowed on the weekends 




 It's Dystopian Fiction, which I like, set in the future where the world is split up into five different sections. Just find my xbox live account and my bio will tell you :P. Just read it. I have recommended it to all of my friends, teachers, my mom, and my step-mom. Although my friends haven't read it, 'cause books, everyone I know is obsessed and crystal at the end. It's really intense and action packed with people jumping off of moving trains. But then there's like a pinch of a crush turns into a pinch of a crush for him, but in the last book it WOULD not have turned out the same without him. It's just, amazing. Read it. Pm when your done 




 It's fun. I don't think I should be talking to someone with that username though......... 




 Archery is really fun, I read the hunger games and I was like, I wanna try that! But now I don't like archery because of the hunger games I like that satisfying thud when I hit a ten. And I know how reddit has a lot of gross stuff but I only browse sections that are the most appropriate for me. Of course there is that one post on here about penises or something, but in didn't click it!!!!! Eww! And I know no other twelve year old girl that likes video games and the color black, but then there's those idiot guys that are like " OMG I'm a gamer now!!!!! I bought (way outdated game like world at war)!!!" 




 Ooh good question? Was it about unicorns?!! 




 Coolio 




 If you are about to go to bed why did you post this? can you sleep-comment?
 




 Hi I'm twelve and I'm really bored. I like soccer, archery, video games, laughter, and the Divergent and Hunger Games book series. AMA!! 




 I'm guessing it's about airplanes. I'll watch it sometime over break 




 I don't really care anymore since I purchased the xbox one, but thanks for the tip! 




 The only thing I can do is delete stuff, which I have tried and I want/need everything I have OR I can change the memory unit to cloud but for some reason that option isn't available when I go into Halo 4 




 Will do. Unless you are joking with me and the movie is unrated and I will get grounded. 




 I love halo, too. But when I bought Halo 4, you have to download all of the game types onto the xbox and I have like no storage left so I wasted sixty bucks on a game I can only stare at and say I have 




 I come home at 3:00, do homework, go to soccer at 4:00, come home at 7:00, eat at 8:00, shower and do all that good stuff, and then go to bed.  




 I really like those too,; I like pretty much every variety of games, but I recently got Ghosts for Christmas and thought it was a lot better then other Call of Duty's. 




 Or a phone. I see third graders with iPhone 5s gold's but I don't even have a firefly (a phone that only calls parents and home) 




 None of my friends have a bedtime. If they do, it's 11:00. It is now "normal schedule"  to have no bedtime 




 I love Ace Ventura. a little inappropriate, but alright 




 Lately, I have been obsessed with COD ghosts. Don't worry, I'm fine. My grades are very high and I love reading and I always find a way to get in good with my teachers. I say I like a certain series.... BAM!!!!!  A 4 on reading. And I'm only allowed to play on my consoles on the weekends, so I'm fine 




 My parents know I use reddit and I often tell funny jokes I found on here.
My grades are fine, math isn't hard yet! We are only in algebra.
I'm twelve. I don't even know what cannabis is. 




 SPOILERS****

I feel that tris is too pretty in the movie. The whole book series she is telling herself she is ugly and in Allegiant when the are about to have sex, she says that she is pale, weak, and flat chested. She is none of these in the trailer. 




 ALRIGHTY THEN!!!!!! - Ace Ventura 




 My bedtime is 9:00, but we are currently on Christmas break until the 9th. 




 I prefer xbox. 




 I recently got an xbox one, but I have an Xbox 360 and a ps3. I enjoy first person shooters, but I like other games like minecraft and Terraria 




 I'm twelve years old and live in California(U.S.) and I love playing video games! I have an update for black ops two right now so I'm really bored and it's taking forever so ask away!!! 




 What part of California do you live in? 




 In all capitals, type in SDRAWKCAB. Its in a snow biome, there is floating islands, giant hills, and much more! By far my favorite seed  




 GT: Jade Sueta. I will be on a lot the next couple of weeks and a lot of today.  




 Thanks! And for future reference, how many eight year olds go on reddit? I dont think thats a problem here.  




 Im twelve. Everythin i can get away with 




 I got so excited and then BAM! Rule one:  you have to be thirteen. I turn thirteen in 49 days. I have a mic. Can i please play? 




 So your saying i have to waste minecraft playing time by going on a website and signing up and THEN add you and play? Thanks, but no. 




 I just started a new survival world and you are welcome to join it! Im on right now. Its not very far in the making but i will be on for a few hours every day. Ill add you!

 Gt: Jade Sueta. Im on tomorrow 




 You can make an infinite water source next to your moat. I dont know how to do a water pump but just make a 2 by 2 hole one block deep and take a water bucket and pour it in the corner. Do the same the exact opposite the corner with the water and Voila! Take water as much as you want from the hole  




 Hey i an help 




 Gt: jade sueta 
I'll be on tomorrow

 Server still up? 




 GT: Jade sueta. If you need any help i got ya and i have a mic but i dont use it often. 




 Yaaaay i love them! 




 Jade Sueta. Ill help you out and play with ya. 




 Now i am since i clicked the link. 




 Well, Allegiant would be rated R, because of the sex, but the other movies should be okay i think 




 And they don't mention Marcus at all in the trailer and that worries me. 




 The trailer makes it look like this is a love story. Sure, she is in love with Tobias, but it looks like they take out the action. That one sneak peak we get with the cheesy music is part of the love story. I hope it more action than love in the real movie 




 Haha shovelface i l o l ed 




 I thought the Hunger Games was about what Suzanne Collins thinks of reality tv.... That it is so stupid where people enjoy watching kids kill each other. 




 I hope its not the next hunger games. I loved the books, and Catching Fire was great, but SOOO many people havent read the book. I want Divergent to be popular to where only people who have read the book see the movie even though that eill never happen :P 




 Jade sueta is my name. I have a mic 




 Jade Sueta. Ill be on tomorrow 




 What does that do? 









 Relevant username  




 When Ezra was A. 




 Why? 




 Today? Will it be running today? 




 As you can read from the title it says that i want to go to the End. I currently have a mic but dont use it often. Anyone can join, you dont need a mic but i prefer one. I will be on for multiple hours today if anyone wants to beat the ender dragon with me. GT: Jade Sueta 




 Ill play. gT: Jade Sueta 




 Jade sueta is my gamertag 




 How will you speak too that H-o-o-o-o-rse. WHAT DOES THE FOX SAY 




 I really hope its not and that ezra just found the lair. But yes, it showed it right there, so i think its Ezra 




 Have you written anything yet?  




 I don't know if this is bad or good..... 




 Stapling water to a tree. Not everything is possible, people!!! 




 Jade Sueta is the name, im happy to play the game! 




 I might be on tomorrow. GT: Jade Sueta 




 I can see why people think that, since that is what they grow up with. A tv show I don't like that is old is Lizzy Mcguier or however you say her name. A tv show I don't like now is Dog with a blog. That is teaching kids that animals can speak because then they will try to talk to their dog like they are a human and annoy the shit out of their parents. But who doesn't like sponge bob???? 




 Please be under the age of sixteen  




 Yeah what's your user? 





























 Do not make it a box. Use creativity, move out of your comfort zone. Use more materials than cobble and oak wood, unless you use a cool pattern or something. Hope that helps a bit :) 




 Whyyyyy did I click on that. I rate 1/10 




 Title says it all. 




 Oh, if you ever get a new console, I recommend an xbox. Oh, and how did you become such a night owl? How does it affect your daily life?  




 Do you have any consoles?  




 If you have a mic you can join me and my friends world to kill the Ender dragon. GT Jade Sueta 




 I'll try to answer anything the best I can!  




 Sorry, but the world is not a wish granting factory, imakeyoupost. 




 I just want to start a new world and play some survival with the goal of killing the Ender Dragon. GT: Jade Sueta 




 Why are you bored right now? You could always go to sleep. Or are you having trouble sleeping? 




 Do you ever intend to try to be a famous producer? Or are you simply doing it for joy? What king of video games do you play? 




 What are your hobbies? 




 I blew your mind, did I not? 




 Are your socks also white? 




 Have you considered purple? 




 Why? 




 What is your favorite color? 




 Just use one v and people will think your Russian. 




 What is your favorite color? 




 Its 3:00 right now in about 5 hours I'll be awake! Just message me when I'm on! 




 My GT is Jade Sueta if you need anyone else. 




 GT: Jade Sueta      I have a world which is going nicely and I'm trying to defeat the Enderdragon. You are welcome to join if you like!

 Which letter is different? 




 It doesn't work.... The minecart with chest just bounces up and down 




 I got amity but I feel more dauntless . 




 Where can I take this test? 




 Detergent is actually a parody book about 100 pgs and it's super funny you should read it, reddit 




 That looks like if P!nk got fat with brown hair 




 Stampy's laugh is a little "wow" but squid is okay. 




 You go on reddit? I had no idea.... 




 Sounds awesome GT Jade Sueta 




 Everything changed for me when you said you were a girl. 




 I'll be on in about a half an hour. My gamertag is Jade Sueta 




 GT Jade Sueta. Message me whenever 




 I hope it's better than the warm bodies movie. They changed everything in that movie 




 It is an illness. A terrible illness that way too many people have 




 I'm defeating the Enderdragon and need some help if you want to join! GT jade Sueta

 Super bored. Super sick. I will be on for a few hours if anyone wants to play with me. Send me a message at Jade Sueta saying you're from reddit and we can start! Mic not needed, but preferred. 




 I'm killing the Enderdragon if you want to join message me at Jade Sueta 




 Yeah it my be a glitch but that is a lot of glitches at once. 




 I'm working on defeating the Enderdragon and you are welcome to join me GT Jade Sueta 




 Either Herobrine ( the "evil ghost" of minecraft) or there was a Creeper behind him, the well was from villagers, the mobs are glitchy, and Endermen are taking blocks. :P I'm going with Herobrine. 




 My GT is Jade Sueta is anyone else wants to join! 




 Alright I'm on your friends list I just never see you on minecraft 




 Sometimes I think I should get off reddit and go to my room, but then I think "mmmm, better not" 




 Me neither 




 I am a girl 




 Awesome! 




 12 




 Will I have a lot of homework tomorrow? 




 I have never beaten the Enderdragon before and I want to, but I want to do it with someone! If you want to play, add me at Jade Sueta. No mic needed. 




 I have never been in public and seen a girl in cloths.  









 I just added you GT Jade Sueta 




 I just added you

 Jade Sueta is my GT ill be on Saturday 




 Ill be on Saturday GT Jade Sueta

 Gt Jade Sueta 




 Not unless you are on the same xbox. That fits up to four players. 




 You can get a three month sub. 20 bucks. Besides, you need a lot of people for hunger games, and you can't play it w/ out a map to play on. So to play hunger games on Xbox, you have to be famous on YouTube or something anyway 




 You can only play with people on a different xbox than you if you have a membership. 

However, you can play in a world with someone if they are on the same xbox as you (split screen) 




 I'll be on in a few minutes. I have to use my kinect, since I can't find my regular headset, so I might sound weird. Gt: jade sueta 




 Hmm. I only have about 60'friends but I'll try the internet thing in the morning. Ps. How do you reset your internet? I'm an idiot.

Edit: I now only have 46 friends and I reset my internet connection, it still doesn't work.. 




 Amen 




 What do mean "max to about 50" (sorry, I know nothing about anything) 




 Not that it matters or anything, but I'm a girl:) 




 GT jade sueta 




 Like storyline. It takes a while to play through. ( I think ) 




 I have seen two library's, and spider spawners in front of a stronghold, but never a spawner in a stronghold. 




 I'm on mobile, but if you go on YouTube and look up stampy's lovely world, click on one of the videos. He build a bunch of different things every episode and they are pretty awesome. 




 I might be free tomorrow I'll help ya then. 




 Let's plays are always fun. Especially with 2 people. Like stampylongnose and Iballisticsquid are my favorite mine craft you tubers. They are really funny, and kid friendly, too.  




 Going into sixth grade or seventh? (Middle school starts in seventh grade where I live), and I'm also going into middle school this year. 




 GT: Jade Sueta. You can add me I'm too lazy. 




 Aww I just had to get off. I'll be back on in a few days though! 




 Am I too late? :D 




 Whenever I try to play with someone, it tells me to log in. But then it loads for a while and says " you have lost your connection to EA nation." Even when I first enter the game and press start, the first thing that pops up at the bottom is "you have lost connection to EA nation," has anyone else had this problem? 




 That would be awesome? What's your gamertag? 




 Xbox. 




 Yes sorry I forgot to clarify!  




 Does anyone go on this subreddit anymore? I'm looking for people to skate with, since none of my friends have this game. GT: Jade Sueta.  




 Wow. I'm glad you never got an abortion. I wish you and your children the best. 




 Do you regret it? We're you ever considering abortion? 




 Yes.  




 If only there was a solution to being called mainstream....... 




 The list is the same as everyone I have asked. Ever. 




 Interesting. What's your favorite drink then? 




 If I were to go to England, and do my best accent, would you be able to tell I was from America?  




 favorite song? 




 Favorite color?
Coffee or Tea? 
Favorite food?
Would you rather cut off your leg or cut of your dominant arm. 




 Sorry, I had to go. Try to be on tomorrow. I'll have a mic then. 




 Oh haha I should have figured. "Shane" anigans. I'll try to get on for a while. 




 My GT is Jade Sueta. 




 Will you be on in 3 hours by any chance? 




 Photograph. Or maybe Don't. Or Runaway.  




 I think the option for more than 8 players is ridiculous. It would lag so bad, even with good internet connection.  




 Well, my step mom keeps calling him ed sheerian and she already said "no listening to Ed sheerian when your family is talking to you." But I have no idea who Ed Sheerian is so I'm just gonna listen to Ed Sheeran instead. 




 I'm not really obsessed with him as a person. All I really know about him is he is a twenty-three year old singer from England. 




 Yes, actually. When P!nk's Truth About Love came out, I would listen to it more than a normal person would. But still, it was not to the same extent that this album's obsession has caused. 




 My family is starting to get mad at me for not paying attention to them. I just love his new album so much I feel I HAVE to listen to it. 




 Actually, this really isn't the Stampy we know and love. We love the child friendly, upbeat, joyous Stampy that never curses. 




 If you don't like it don't watch it. Simple as that. 




 Princess Consuela Banana Hammock. 




 My cousins are 8, 4, and 6 I think. There about 7 other people in the theater so it was nice except a kid kept kicking the back of my seat( I don't even know why they were there the entire theater was empty almost) I think they liked it. The four year old kept shouting( IM TIRED! IS IT OVER YET??) which I kinda wanted to say myself. I only liked it because the robots cute. 




 The robot was really cute, but it felt like the movie was over in five minutes. It was going really slow, then a bunch of action for like 20 seconds, then it being slow again. I spent about 1 hour watching pieces of metal forming a spaceship in the air. 









 To be happy and do what you want with your life. Don't waste your life doing things for other people, because at the end of the day, it's only you. Yolo. Don't waste it. 




 Guns.  




 I don't have skype.  




 Oh, I do to!  I think I'm gonna go to bed,  batman! I'll talk to you tomorrow night I guess. 




 I don't really care to be a comedian, but my lifetime goal is to be an actress. I am so excited to enter 7th grade this year so I can join Drama!  




 Black ops 2 is my favorite call of duty game.
Minecraft is my favorite arcade game.
Halo reach is my favorite Halo game. 
I also recommend Skate 3 and Naughty Bear!  




 Probably my obsession with humor. Whenever I hear someone laugh I want to make them laugh more and find out the joke and everything about it. I love making people laugh, so here's a joke!  

Why was the baby strawberry sad?
His parents were in a jam!



Okay, that was a bad one, but I need some time!  




 Yes! I feel like I have to go play xbox and find a way to politely excuse myself from the people that created me. And that's great that nothing has happened from the energy drinks. Just be careful!  




 My underwear. Accidental wedgies are the worst. 




 I would kill to be in your spot right now. I love talking to people over the internet, but it is totally different in real life. Except for family and best friends, I would be down to live as  a bat! Have you ever gotten ill  because of the amount of energy drinks you drink? Or has it ever affected you? 




 Look up Nigahiga's YouTube video "Dear Ryan, the chicken or the egg". I think the chicken came first. 




 This is actually REALLY interesting incase you didn't know. I would love to know more, but the problem is I don't know what to ask!  Do you ever get lonely since you have little social contact? 




 I concur! That's about where I am :) and I'm assuming you turned out fine :D I'm obsessed with books, which I wouldn't really consider geeky 




 What kind of kid were you in middle school 




 What time do you normally go to sleep in the morning/ wake up at night? 




 Where are you most ticklish? 




 Coke or Pepsi? 




 Well can't you  reverse it by doing the same thing with your new schedule so it will flip again? Then you won't need sleeping pills or anything. Just a thought!  




 I wanted people to know I was a girl when I had my old xbox live account. I just kinda kept with it. 
























 My brother is from Sweden. Some places are really pretty! I highly recommend going, if you ever get he chance. 




 Well that's good. 




 Where are you? 




 Cancun is amazing. Make sure to go parasailing!  




 At least you're creative! 




 Aw why not? 




 Any place you have ever wanted to visit or see in person? 




 Have you checked the game settings? Maybe you accidently turned them down? Stupid question, but it's possible. 




 Mine is all old and wrinkly even though I tried making the parents and grandparents young. :/ 




 Alright I might be on later today. 




 No, he does not. 




 Middle school! I played that in 5th grade but it stopped really quick when none of us got in trouble. 




 I remember a few months ago when I started playing the game again. I felt so amazing I never wanted to stop playing. 




 Oops,look what I commented below! Sorry I'm just getting used to this mobile app. 




 Aww I just got off but I might be on tomorrow if I finish my homework. My gamer tag is Jade Sueta. Just add me and when I get to it I'll accept. See you soon :) 




 I'm a noob that wants money so if anyone wants to do some missions with me to help me rank up that would be awesome! Leave your gamertag below I will add you in a few minutes. I'm on xbox btw 




 Yeah especially when they are a low rank or don't have any good guns :/ 




 If everyone's blip is red then that means they have been bad. 




 What is your favorite color? 




 If you want to play add me at Jade Sueta. I will be playing on Normal. Mic preffered.  




 My xbox fell and my GTA got totally scratched but I'll try to buy a new one later today :) 




 Wow I never realized that I have already completed half of school(not including college, of course). And of course I'm proud of my "manly music". Thanks for asking a question. Have an internet point. 




 Yes. They are amazing. I'm a girl, but I grew up sort of a tomboy. When I turned 11 I think, I started changing and liking some girly things. But you can never make me not like the Weeknd. 




 Either P!nk, Ed Sheeran, or The Weeknd. 




 About 6 months ago. 




 Oops! Well it's good she is doing better, anyway :) 




 Aww well I hope she gets better, if there is any way too. It's nice she has such a great son to take care of her:) 




 Where where you vacationing at? I'm definitely afraid of spiders. All spiders. All sizes. No no no. 




 How are you doing right now? 




 Is she doing okay right now? When was her last seizure? How bad is her memory loss? 




 7th grade. We got our schedule and walked around campus. Super boring. 




 I got it back. Thanks! 




 Oh I knew I would have to call someone but Mor's only got added to my phone after I joined 3 different lobbies. Thanks! 




 The movie changed a lot of things. If it wasn't a book, it would have been a fair movie though. 




 I made the mistake of wearing pants and I felt like death. AMA 




 Try bag balm. It really helps. 




 You can me if you want too. GT: jade Sueta 




 If you are on xbox add Jade Sueta. I'll be on in a while. 




 No it's not. First people spawned ufo's but now the hackers like to spawn rocks. Nothing specialz 




 I have insurance on my car but how do I get it back? I thought if I had insurance on it I could never lose it...... 




 Yeah but with how much people drive around it would get annoying as hell after a few hours. 




 Woops. 




 I'm online right now. Add me at Jade Sueta. 




 Pot shot is really good it gives you 10,000 dollars and it's not that hard. That and definitely rooftop rumble. 




 This is in easy mode right? 




 Ha. I love seeing posts from so long ago. 




 That's great. Naturevideo games. Get out and explore. 

It seems like everyone I meet that has a mic just wants to point a gun at my head and make me join the crew. I would rather get shot a million times than join a crew with those douches. But I'm sure sometime I'll find a good crew and some friends. Thanks for taking the time to write all this out, I hope you don't get eaten by a bear, and I'm on mobile so sorry if I made a bunch of spelling errors. Farewell, pleasant internet friend. 




 Cool. If there's ever an opportunity to have more fun, I will always take it. Thanks, I was gonna see if any of my friends had gta5, and now I can't wait to get back to my xbox and level up some more :D. Do you have xbox by any chance?  




 What exactly will I do with friends? What can I do with them that I can't in solo? 




 I'm a level 8 and trying to answer this question as well. But if you get one person into a mission lobby with you and keep doing races with one person you can rank up really fast. If you are on xbox I would love to add you and go on some missions together. 




 So don't be a douche. Got it.  




 Yeah I have a mic. Alright, see you then.:) 




 99.9% of people just rubbed their eyes to see if it still works. 




 West coast. Yeah I'm still on. GT Jade Sueta if you wanna add me I guess. 




 Xbox sorry I forgot to put that. 




 Any good ways to earn some money other that glitches? 




 I noticed this too and thought it was quite funny. 




 I hear that the higher ranks are going to demolish me. Any tips for a newbie? 




 Really. 




 I think I have this. I always seem to want to pull out my eyebrows and eyelashes. I never knew it was a mental disorder. 




 I have not built any parks but I would love to just free skate on hardcore with someone. I'll be on in a few days to add you.  




 Bath or shower? 




 Then go to coolmath4kids. They have plenty of fractions. 




 But the spiders wanted revenge.. 




 I added you.  :D 




 I'm twelve and I strongly disagree with that. I wish I got to choose, but I didn't, because people like you think I'm "just a kid" and I don't know anything. 




 Are you online? We could play? 




 OMG I'm a girl :O lol 
























 I don't have IB, Ghorn, or even Atheons Epilogue.  




 IM A CHILD AND IM ONLY ALLOWED TO PLAY VIDEO GAMES ON WEEKENDS SO I HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL FRIDAY! 




 What console? 




 Thats not that bad, I expected it to be more. I guess I'll try to save up for the $35 one to save a few bucks for the next one. (And I have askednicely 




 Well this sucks, my parents refuse to get me it for Christmas as video games are a waste of time, and I'm a kid with no money :( could you tell me how much the DLC is so I can start trying to convince my grandpa I need money for school supplies? 




 Do you have to buy the DLC to get to light lvl 32? Do you have to buy the DLC to get the new raid and weapons? I don't think I will be able to buy the DLC, but I still want the full Destiny experience. 




 I'm a middle school "Kindergaurdian" and all the people I play with say I don't squeak so I refuse to take offense to this like I do all the other posts complaining about young guardians.  




 That only *hands* could satisfy 




 Destinylfg people have always wanted to cheese the Templar for me. I don't even know HOW to kill the Templar legitly.  




 Yes. I have good friends who now play on xbox one while I'm still on 360. They were kind enough to hop on 360, do that 1 gig update, spend 20 minutes finding other level 30's and ran me through the hard raid. I got Timebreaker, The Truth, and the chest and gauntlets. All I need is the helmet now :) 




 First time running hard mode raid, I got the Timebreaker, the Truth, the raid chest, and raid gauntlets.  




 "I hear they're almost ready"

 I know, I cringed myself through it. And I laughed so hard at the end when he said " umm, rapping isn't normally my style, but I hope you enjoyed!" 




 Okay I thought after you heard the song it would be very clear that I was being *extremely sarcastic* 




 http://youtu.be/7zez-WjcZhw 




 Haha I put this up as a joke, I saw this video and I really had to push myself to actually watch it. I wanted to know if everyone else thought the same. 









 Thank you! 




 Hahaha that was perfect! 




 Like if you stumble across a hilarious spelling error that makes the sentence completely different? 




 Wow thank you so much! 




 Awesome! I only need four, so I that means I can upgrade twice if I get as many as you do! 




 Are there any good imgur apps that you know of? I type in imgur in the App Store and like 20,000 imgur apps pop up! 




 I'm mostly a mobile user, but is it possible to post a link from my camera roll? Or do I have to upload my picture on imgur to get a link so I can post to reddit? 




 Cool, I have an extra legendary plate I don't need, hopefully I'll get a few out of that. 




 thats awesome! I'll ask a few friends. Thanks. 




 thanks!  




 I'm a lvl 24 and to rank up my chestplate defense I need 6 ascendant shards. I already have two, but I have no idea how I got them. What's the fastest way to get ascendant shards?
 




 Hahahaha my friend told me this forever ago! 




 i got this achievement by doing a the Heroic Weekly strike. You don't need to do the VoG to get the achievement.

Wait, nevermind! Wrong achievement! I was thinking of Flawless Striker. 




 Diarrhea because migraines just suck. 




 Have you read Enders Game series? (Im assuming you have, based on your username) how do you like it? 




 Im in middle school (junior high) What is post secondary? Elementary school? 




 that doesn't sound like fun. I'm a few paragraphs done, but it was mostly my partner doing it. I look up the articles, she puts my quotes into words.  




 Once upon a time, there was a dad and a mom and a bunch of kids. One day, the mom and all of the kids get murdered except for one child. The dad raised the child as normal, but one day the kid disappeared when he went off on his own to check out something. The dad then devoted his life to finding his kid, even if it meant traveling across the ocean. He had the help of a mentally ill silly woman. Together, they find his son Nemo and they are happily reunited.  




 No, I can't think of anything that could connect the two, except its in your head. 




 In English we were doing a 9/11  unit and we have to explain the reactions and stuff on how tragedy affects community and do an analysis and stuff. 

 




 Meh. I have other things on my mind then whether or not I like beards. I guess they're okay. 




 I really don't feel like writing said essay, so if you could ask me some questions to take my mind off the fact that I should not be on reddit right now. 




 Definitely has to be Photograph. From the second I heard it I knew I would love it. I was on the verge of tears with how beautiful it was. 




 Whether it involves a hose or swimming in the ocean, I want to hear it! 




 Im on right now my gamertag is Jade Sueta. 




 Still looking? Ill add you 




 Ansel Elgort *don't judge me* 




 Is there a subreddit for *everything on this site?* 




 *GASP* how did you discover my secret!? 




 Wow believe it or not I had no idea that subreddit existed! 




 That would be awesome. 




 Um... Sorry??? 









 Haha but either way I have no answer. I don't really listen to eminem often. 




 Well maybe in a few million years the world will shift and it won't be so lonely anymore.  




 Its an island in the middle of an ocean.... 




 I feel like this is a trick question and I'm supposed to answer " ew I hate eminem he's not a REAL rapper like (insert weird rapper name here)" 




 More like upper middle class. My parents want to move to Hawaii, so we have to save money and shit, but then they go and buy my bro an iPad mini when I can't have a bag of chips at the store! And woah, now we pay 130 a month so me and him can go to Tae Kwon Do! ( not complaining, I love TKD) 




 Sonic the hedgehog, talking tom, and this guy who looks like a rapper with a foreign language as subtitles. And those are just a few of the thumbnails. 




 Well on YouTube he always types in "asdfghjkl"  




 The world will never know. 




 Ama 




 The music was bad, and it wasn't so much a stunt montage as much as it was a "jumping off the same 4 things for six minutes" montage, but hey, you can only improve from here! :) 




 Well survival is partly fun, part cash. Me and my friends will grind sandy shores surivival for like an hour an a half, and 20 thousand isn't that bad for each one. I think if you are with people you enjoy and doing a survival, it's like a podcast or commentary or something. It just gives you something to make some money while chatting or talkingabout something with your friends. If you are just going in with random people sitting there in silence while playing, you're gonna have a bad time. ( and 20k on ammo! Do you only play with sticky bombs or something? 




 Thanks! I'll add you when I get on tomorrow. 




 Why........? 
























 Nope. Also pve

 Only requirement is you must have maxed Sultan SA/5. Message Jade Sueta  




 I can be sword bearer on Crota, relic holder for VoG, can grind out some Iron Banana, etc. Message Jade Sueta. 




 I can sherpa you through it anytime, add Jade Sueta. Not everyone is like that, you just ran into some bad people. 




 Thank you for caring, it really means a lot. My step mom is getting gradually better, she buys me Apple cider, and snacks for school. I really think I can make it just a few more months. I AM talking to people about it. You, my mom, I even call my brother in San Francisco from time to time just to vent. Again, thank you. 




 They spoil them completely. Look at one of my old posts, my 4 y/o bro has an iPad! But when I'm around, I take care of them. When I'm not there, they yell at them *sometimes* but only when they deserve it. They love my little brothers, just not me. 




 Just a few months, and I can get out. I can wait. None of my teachers like me, or will listen to me. I talk too much and try to get attention, since at home I don't get much. My birthday is in May, I can make it.  




 I talk to my mom about it a lot and she says I will either have to speak up to them or live with it. She will help me through anything, I know that. I'm just afraid. My school doesn't have a counselor, I dont want to talk to one anyway. Thank you for the kind words. I don't think my dad will do anything physically, he hasn't in a while. The only thing he has done to me was spank, but I think he knows I'm too old for that now. He has threatened once in the past few months, I fear he will go through with it, but deep down I just know he won't. My stepmother threatened to slap me in the face, but I don't even fear her. I just despise her. 

I'm trying to take care, but it's just so hard being the only adult around because my father and stepmom won't. I'm practically raising my little brothers. 




 I will only regret the decision to *not* leave.  




 I have tried talking to them... My older brother has as well. When that happened, my dad slammed him into a cabinet. He later moved out to my mom's house. When I tried to talk to them, they just started yelling at me that I have a bad attitude and I got grounded for 3 weeks. 

My brothers wonderful advice was to put up with it and act like I was happy and always have a smile on my face. Then when I turn 13, move out to my mom's house. My brother waited until my dad pushed him (age 17) because he didn't want me to be alone there. But here I am, about to turn 13, and I'm so so scared of telling them I want to leave. My mom knows, she said my dad would take it to court, and we would have to fight. She said we would win, because dad already has lost a son. If CPS has been called before this on him then surely we will win, right? and it's not about the chores; I'm fine with doing chores. It's that the ONLY time they EVER talk to me is to yell at me about them. 

Our family will never come together. You would thing that my bro leaving is a wake up call to them, but it's not. They still think they are the perfect parents with the perfect family, and they will always think that. Some people dont change.

 




 Haha my dad is a cop. 




 It's not like that. They hate me too. I dont talk to them, I'm basically a maid. You think it's "oh its the standard teenager, saying she hates her (step)parents because they won't get her an iPhone 6". I'm just here ~~so I don't get fined~~ so they can be lazy. 




 My dad only ever talks to me if it's to do chores/schoolwork. I can't remember the last time he *actually* talked to me. He always yells, and complains that he's so sore from crossfit. 

My stepmother acts like she owns me, like I'm an *object*. I don't have real conversations with here either. When I'm at this house, I never talk. Just do chores, mow the lawn, get grounded because I have a bad attitude, and do schoolwork that isn't due for 3 WEEKS. They always yell at me, make me call them Sir and Ma'am.

And I hate them for it. 




 That they aren't perfect.

 Hey there, Vault of Glass newbies! Today is your day to get that sweet, sweet loot from VoG. Here's a few things you should have: 

1) Have a microphone, communication is the key to success!

2) Be a level 26 or higher. You can accomplish this by having a full set of rare gear.

3) Have a positive attitude! No one likes that one guy that complains the whole raid.

 I do, actually. My dad is a cop since I was pretty little he would take me to the range every weekend. I now have a couple rifles to take with me.

My username was an old Xbox Gamertag. About a year ago when I made this account I couldn't think of anything else so I just stuck with it.

I'm having a "falling out" (I can't think of another word, sorry) with my parents, but I guess that's it.

Lol, that's all I have to say for that one. Yeah, it's *SUPER DUPER* being 13!!!!!!!!1!1!1111

Being able to shave(no, really) everyone else does it, and I grow hella hair.
