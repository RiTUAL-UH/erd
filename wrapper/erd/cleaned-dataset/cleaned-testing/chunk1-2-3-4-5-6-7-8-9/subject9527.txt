 Why would anyone want this film dedicated to them?

why did they keep doing the same "I'm about to walk out of the room oh shit i made a noise" trick 12 times?

So this baby stayed in the cabinet all night and part of the day and NEVER made a sound? Does no one go to bathrooms in bus stations? I've been to bathrooms in bus stations and it's like a urine donation center where they pay 5 dollars for a half gallon of your pee. 

If Michael Myers house is curse why did someone sell it to a new family? Who are these people? Why do they keep a shit broke down car on the lawn? Do they want it to look like a halloween house? The dad said he doesn't like halloween.

Why is the mom so naive? Like her kid keeps running away from her. Can't she see that this kid is a lost cause? He probably wants to get offed. 

What does the annoying blonde kid everyone hated have to do with Michael Myers? He's not blood releated. They don't make mention of this shit other than saying that he gets nightmares. But the baby is related to Michael Myers. What the fuck is this mythology?

What did the legion of the tipped hat do to get Michael Myers to have a kid? Did someone jerk off Michael Myers? Is Michael Myers a horny guy? Because he doesn't give any signs of it. 

Why does the legion of the tipped hat seem in cahootz with Michael Myers, but at the end Mr. Myers kills them? What was the point of them anyways? They were fufilling some half assed made up prophecy that i'm still not sure what the goal was, but they don't make sense.

What's the green goo? This addition made no sense. Why is there green goo? There's one insert shot of a bunch of letters. Is this Green Goo concentrated letters? Did scientists discover the alphabet is real? Why has this not been shared with the world? People would love to see real life letters. Sesame Street would be so cool.

Why is Michael Myers so fucking overpowered? I get he's a cereal killer, but this guy has fucking transportation power, but he can only walk. This makes no sense. How did he get these powers? Isn't Michael Myers just some large ass idiot with a high pain tolerance and a killer streak? Why is this not enough? Why does he need to be Halloween Goku? 

Why is Paul Rudd in this movie? I don't get his presence. He puts these family idiots in more peril second only to the main lady who's just a danger to herself. What's so important about the teenage kid? He's annoying. Let him go.

Why is this called the curse of michael myers? Michael Myers is just a dumb killing idiot machine. The curse is by the cult of the tipped hat. What does this have to do with ancient letters? Those letters never appear again after they are mentioned. 

Why even bother making number 6 if you don't have a script? This shit made no sense. Why does the lady not just drive till she runs out of gas back to town? Why did she stop at the bus station?  


































 I tried everything to get him to watch anything other than the 8 or 9 Marvel movies. I tried breaking his arms, I tried showing him other movies where I edited the Marvel logo in to trick him into thinking that MArvel produces Orson Wells and Carol Reed movies, I even tried to take him to a hypnotherapist to get him to see that Marvel movies aren't the best thing ever made. It turns out my son is leaving with my DVD of Batttman Vs Superman. Should I be worried? He said he wants to fornicate passionatly with the DVD and that there's nothing wrong with a relationship between a DVD and himself. 

My son has also decided to sexually identify as a DVD player and I told him you can't do that because it's all about imax and blu ray 8k you'd be behind the times and I'd have to disown you can't you idenify as a blu ray player at the least or a pc and he said no because he likes consols better and I said I have to disown you son. I don't know what to do. Is Battman captain of the Marvel team? I just can't figure a way to get to my son fifi. 









 Why are there no subtitles for Eddie Redmayne. He speaks like he's trying not to get caught pissing off in church.

Does NO ONE live in Chicago? I get the whole "we got alien CGI artists who can fix this to hide our presence" but during that whole dogfight apparently only three people live in the city. 

Why bees? How did this not get established in the prolouge?

Why is Eddie Abraxis so careful to not kill other human beings sometimes but sends his goons to kill three guys just ramblin' around a Chicago bridge? This dudes track record seems inconsistent. 

Why did Queen Kunis know about the telescope, exact make and model of the one stolen from the house in the beginning, was being sold on ebay? Her mom didn't tell her this stuff, or at least it's not established. 

Why did Channing Tatum break character when Mila Kunis offered to dress his wound with a tampon? 

Why is Mila Kunis in this movie? Why does everyone look like they are from Farscape? Is this a Farscape movie?

Why does Mila Kunis' cousin keep saying "Only English?" Does he know he's in a movie? Are CGI subtitles expensive? 

Why is there a romantic comedy in the middle of a space opera? I feel like Tim Gunn would feel these clash and would be poking at this movie saying "MAKE IT WORK."

How did Channing Tatum Master Chief that ship shirtless, in space, and without a suit? Only Master Chief can travel in a slipspace rupture outside of a ship. 














 Best prequel to Insidious possible. Was great to learn Lin Shaye's origin as a evangelical fighting against the Knights in Satan's Service. The camera work was also pretty awesome. Lots of movement, not a static shot in the whole movie.  




 Why does this guy make 3 mustache jokes within the first six minutes of the movie? Is this his thing? Is the mustache Mortdecai?

 














 What are these levels for creatures? Why mention that they have levels if you're not going to mention them again?

Why did Ben Barnes love interest admit everything villainous she's doing to Barnes' face and the dude didn't go, "Wait wut you're spying on us?"

Why did Jeff Bridges sound like he had fallen and had not been able to get up for such a long time?

If Ben Barnes is a witch why doesn't he have cool powers like everyone else? Is he a big dud witch? 

Why did Antje Traute sound like she was phonetically reading her lines off a cue card? I know she can speak fluently.

Why was Ben Barnes dad such a push over and what happened to the pig catching Barnes was supposed to do? They're in a small fenced area, how hard is it to catch one?

Does that big Ogre man have like super fast legs because he moves slow as fuck but he manages to find these dudes where ever they are in no time?

What's the deal with Pendle mountain? Is it a mountain? It doesn't seem like anyone has trouble finding Mother Malkin's hideout. It doesn't even seem like it takes long to get there at all? Can Pendle Mountain really be a mountain or a hill?

Why is [Marco Beltrami's music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EDhvQzcSes) better than anything in Seventh Son?

Why does Dijon Honeysue seem so overpowered and smart for the first hour and a half, but then turns into a big dolt in the final fight? 

Why did Malkin think there was going to be a sequel?

EDIT: Since making this post I have some additional questions.

Why is this not a Marvel movie? 

Why does Mother Malkin need that gumball crackerjack toy neckless when she and her crew are already ridiculously over powered?

Jeff Bridges has one week to train Ben Barnes, but this dude Barnes seems like he's pretty much a boss with fighting shit? What's the point of training? 

Why did JEff Bridges keep a demonic knight in his house if he knew that that shit would be dangerous?

Why is this movie so geographically fucked? I mean it looks like this shit has vast expanses between shit, but they seem to get everywhere really quickly? Do these dudes got nike j's or some shit?

And on the journey, they got one week, but it seems like they go past one week? Why one week? Mother Malkin seems like did a fine job without one week to fuck up shit? Why is Jeff Bridges so bad at his job?

What is Mother Malkin's skill set? Why does she have some sort of power to do interior decorating? Where do you get that power with all that shit?

 Shameful display.  This article ignores key facts in order to push a preselected narrative.

1) Pao was not subjected to any particular vitriol on being declared interim CEO, nor until after she began implementing questionable and unpopular policies --- such as banning fat-shaming forums while leaving far more foul content entirely alone.  Even geek-famous fat people (Such as Boogie, a popular Youtube commentator) spoke up against this ham-handedness (and you will be hard-pressed to find anyone on the Internet nicer than Boogie).

2) Pao clearly did not care about the racist/sexist slander, and good on her for that.  No matter how justified one might think they were, that is not how mature and intelligent people handle outrage.  Then again, when tens of thousands gather to burn the President in effigy while screaming approval, mocking his intellect, gender and skin color, we call that a public protest and ask the Administration what they did wrong.  (Note: I'm referencing anti-war protests against Bush)

3) The petition is what gained traction in the press, and it is clearly what Pao is resigning over, BECAUSE it got traction in the press and brought attention to her actions.

Your article is smearing over that with faux outrage --- and I notice that your co-author on the piece also references two of his own previous NYT articles about Pao's legal issues as another way to deflect all of this criticism.

The NYT should not be soapboxing for corporate officers they happen to like.  It's as shameful as when one of your Pulitzer-winners recently tied "Bronies" to accused mass-murderer Dylann Roof merely on basis of a photoshopped t-shirt she had no time (or interest) in verifying before publishing reference to.

https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3cur16/im_mike_isaac_the_new_york_times_reporter/csz9s6t 









 Look, I know exactly what you're doing.

You're trying to conclude that Pao was the victim of sexism because people used language like "cunt" or some other insult; your reasoning being that the slur has some reference to "gender" attached to it, therefore, she is being insulted based on her gender.

This doesn't follow nor does it examine the motivations for why someone would begin to insult her.  Do you really, really think people insulted Pao merely for being a woman?  Then you really do need to explain why people stuck up for Victoria.  Are you going to invent something about how people only defended Victoria to give themselves the appearance of caring about a woman?  That's about as uncharitable as you can be, but at this point, going through your history, I don't think you're here to engage with facts or truly analyze why people felt the way they do but to try to go quote farming for your next big "thinkpiece."  The reaction to Victoria being fired is direct contradiction to the story that redditors, etc, are just trying to drive women off the website, or wherever--and all you just did was handwave it away.  Doesn't fit the story?  Then don't include it.  Journalism at its finest.  Why not claim Victoria was let go out of some gender narrative?  It's just as baseless as the other shit you're trying to claim, but that won't stop you.

I'd suggest you don't understand the sarcastic, caustic, and sardonic nature of internet culture where people will say all sorts of offensive things (even racist or, yes, sexist) despite the motivation being different, but I honestly don't think you're that dim and you're doing this out of an ideological basis to give your personal pet issues more advertisement and try to claim they're really the issue you say they are, blah blah blah.  So let's take this about another character that was unpopular; nobody likes or liked George W. Bush, and everyone made comments about how he looked like a chimp; do you really think people bashed him solely because he looks like a chimp?  No, he was bashed because of his policies and other reasons.  People insulted Michael Moore's weight not because he was fat, but because they were motivated by contrary politics or perceptions of his honesty. This hive of bees doesn't care what gender is sticking its hand in the hive; it'll sting flesh regardless of who it's attached to.

You're going to write up a piece referencing sexism and racism on the internet, removed entirely from the context of the conversation, claim "Chairman Pao" references are motivated solely by racist intent and that her being called a "bitch" is because she's a woman above all else.  You're going to slant this, mislead, and then pat yourself on the back for this bit of "activism."

Nobody gives a flying fuck what Pao's gender is.  Are you this big of an idiot where you think there's some widepread male supremacy movement on the internet?  Go on, prove it, then.  And don't use your feelings or humanities crap, use actual social science.  People here are more concerned with reddit generally keeping a hands-off approach to its communities and not favoring any political perspective (even refusing to censor the most vile ones) than the personal identities and the lives of the admins.

So let's drop all the pretenses.  You know you're being dishonest and you're full of shit, trying to drum up attention to pet causes.  Obviously, we know it too.  So what is your goal here?  It's to try to influence the uninformed, propaganda style, to try to get support for your politics  And you're a piece of shit for trying to play that kind of game.

And I'm not going to be polite to you about this either.  Because this entire show of you being "polite" or professional while you farm for vitriol for your next write-up is just to give yourself an air of professionality and respectability you don't deserve, and to give the impression you're trying to give people a fair shake when your conclusions were predestined.  When you're surrounded by your colleagues, drunk late and night in a bar chatting about work, I'm sure the discussion is much, much different.

 Without meaning to sound condescending, I really think you should endeavour to excavate a little deeper into the mineshaft of cinema. Dumb action-flicks and superhero films are the common metals near the top of the mineshaft. They're completely accessible: everybody 'gets' them. You don't have to do much work to get the shallow sort of no-frills 'entertainment' they provide.

However, something which most teenagers are not yet aware of, is that down there in the mineshaft is a wealth of precious gems so beautiful and so thought-provoking that if you experienced them, you would never want to go back to the rather common and mundane stuff on the surface. Down there are films that can make you cry and leave you in a state of heightened emotion for days. Down there are films that can change your perspective of how you view your own life, or how you view other people. Down there are films that will worm their way into your brain and start to become a part of your identity.

But you can't just leap down the mineshaft. If your diet consists of Transformers, Harry Potters and Avengers, you will break your neck if you try to dive straight for the Blade Runners and the American Beautys. Challenge yourself to dig downwards. Watch films from as many different genres, time-periods and cultures as you can. Try to inch away from your comfort zone. 

Again: please don't think me as being condescending. This isn't an intelligence thing. People who appreciate the "depressing philosophical bullshit" of films like Birdman aren't more intelligent than you. They've just put more time into exploring cinema and adventuring into their own personal mineshaft. I know it seems comfortable at the top, but I can promise you that digging is very, *very* worth your time.

**Dmitri Shostakovich, 1906-1975**

**String Quartet No. 3, F major, Op. 73, 1946**

Just after World War II, Shostakovich, then forty, turned once again from his public orchestral music to his private chamber music, composing his String Quartet No. 3 in F major, Op. 73. While he had already written nine symphonies, Shostakovich was just settling into his emerging series of string quartets that would eventually comprise fifteen quartets written throughout his mature life, including some of his very last compositions. Many feel that the String Quartet No. 3 is among is his best quartets; it was a favorite of the composer himself.

It shows Shostakovich in his full powers as a chamber music composer, skillfully deploying the string quartet to express his utterly distinctive musical personality. From a technical standpoint, the quartet, like many of his later quartets, features an astonishing range of textures, sonic effects and brilliant part writing in the service of music with startling emotional and psychological impact. Successful as abstract musical expression on the one hand, it is nearly impossible to miss the topical and programmatic nature of the quartet, another aspect common to most of Shostakovich's chamber music.

The unspeakable hardships of life in the Soviet Union up through the end of WWII took their toll on Shostakovich: nervous, bitter and depressed, he found his most profound outlet in the safe privacy and intimate expressive capability of chamber music. String Quartet No. 3 is a particularly powerful example.

Of all the nearly forgotten music by Mendelssohn, the most nearly completely forgotten is his music for chorus. Only his songs come close to being as almost entirely ignored, but because a few of them have earned a place in the recital hall, even they have a more prominent place in the repertoire. This 10-disc Brilliant set of Mendelssohn's complete choral works featuring the Chamber Choir of Europe under Nicol Matt addresses this problem even though it may not solve it. The performances are uniformly excellent. The Choir has a smooth tone and superb diction and Matt elicits from them polished balanced and ardent interpretations. Despite the dearth of comparisons, these performances with their clean textures, light tempos, and devout tone are surely as close to definitive as is possible to imagine. For some listeners, of course, this may not be enough to redeem Mendelssohn's heartfelt yet stolid music from obscurity. For others with more open minds, however, this set may serve to introduce a body of sacred works that certainly exceeds any other similar body of works from the same period in terms of skill and sincerity. Though a bit recessed, Brilliant's digital sound is cool and clear.

 Pizar! 




 Now, it's been quite some time since I've last scene the original Kevin Bacon movie about a guy who fights a town with roundhouse dance movies, but watching the remake I noticed something suspicious. Mainly the central romance between Kenny Wormald and Julianne Hough is less authentic than the real one between Miles Teller and Kenny Wormald.

If you're not familiar with the remake of Footloose it came out to the acclaim of no one and was promptly forgotten amongst the shit heap shores of remake island with Total Recall and Straw Dogs. It's the same story except Craig Brewer, the director of Black Snake Moan and that shit where Terrence Howard pretends to play a big boy not on the verge of tears and raps and shit, does something I really don't remember in the original film.

I started getting my suspicions when the introductory scenes between Ren Mackormick (Wormald) and Willard Hewitt (Miles Teller) had this strange air of sexual tension. For instance, Willard and Ren sit down for school lunch and Ren begins to tell Willard of his worldly travels. It's here where all my experience reading erotic novels from Anne Rice and Henry Miller have paid off because Willard starts asking Ren to finish the story of the night Ren went out with two Russian women and had them as his sexual conquests.

Why does Willard want to know this? Especially after they just met. When Willard finds out Ren's story is false he's disappointed like he had a bunch of armed thugs rob his spank bank of Ren Mackormick related erotic fantasies. 

It only gets weirder from here because every interaction with Julianne Hough is dry and unromantic. He's basically trying to save this psycho girl from trying to kill herself, she attempts to play chicken with a train (like she was gonna win...sorry you don't have roundhouse kicks, Hough) and she's under the impression this means Ren loves her when Ren's true love really lies with Willard. 

As the movie goes on Ren learns that Willard can't dance and that in order to challenge the city counsel on the ordinance to make dancing illegal they must have a tete a tete at a car wash where Willard and Ren talk about wet t-shirt contests. But then promptly Ren douses Willard with the car wash hose. When this happens Willard runs around to Ren and they begin wrestling. Perhaps if Craig Brewer had trained his camera a little longer on this scene Ren would have tripped on the water line and Willard would have fallen on top of him. They would have realized that they are in love and embrace each other in chaste french kisses as the music swells and they go off to city to live a bohemian life style. Ren would become a steel worker and Willard a starving artist painting nudes of Zebras and rats with large phallus's on their heads.  

But no. Brewer denies us this possibility for more cock teasing and more audience approved heterosexual mating with Julianne Hough, Now a note on Julianne Hough. Hough is amazing looking.  She really nails the part of playing a down home southern preachers daughter rebelling against her father but she also wears small shorts and this is distracting because it's like on some level Brewer knows he accidentally directed Brokeback Footloose, but ended up having to save face by adding this eye candy. 

Either way, we then have to sit through tedious montages of Willard learning to dance, and it's in the key scene where Willard dances with Ren's nieces in a line dance rendition of "Let's Hear it for the Boys" that really seals the deal because in between the already extremely homosexual undertones of that scene, Brewer adds inserts of Willard and Ren learning to dance in Ren's garage just as the sun falls down. Ren is teaching Willard to "fist-pump" and it looks as if they are holding each other in a masculine version of a ballroom waltz. But this repeats the formula of the car wash scene in which Brewer has the realization that he made Priscilla, Queen of the Footloose Dancefloor and cuts too soon out of shame. 

The movie marches onto the finish, shit resolves and that's how I learned the remake of Footloose is a great movie about two high school boys testing the limits of their sexuality. And if that didn't convince you, the bearback bang bros bus driving scene will.  





























 I experienced something very similar to this, but probably worse in my opinion - not even a week ago.

On July 1st, I got off work and was doing some late night grocery shopping - not even that late, it was about 10:30pm - at the Kroger near my house, who also supply several of these handicap grocery carts for disabled customers which are usually located in the front of the store. I had noticed that this evening, there was none available, because a disabled woman was walking around on a cane asking for one. 

I thought it was strange and was like oh well, must be busy - it is the first of the month. Not very many cars in the parking lot, but I guess people are bulking up for the holiday. So I go on shopping.

Inside the store doing my thing, right off the bat I see 3 people on carts who were clearly not disabled. Of which, one guy was letting his kid, a 7 year old - drive it around, while he walked along side. And this was right in front of the store, in ear-shot of that lady who actually needed a one. They could hear her asking for it, still did nothing - kept on going.

It really pissed me off, but I thought well, maybe they're disabled and it's just not evident. I'll hold my tongue, just do my shopping - get out of here.

So I keep on going, I see a 4th cart - same thing. This time 2 young women, which got my attention when one got up and let the other sit/drive the cart. I just stopped and stared at them like... for real? You know there's a lady up front right now who actually needs one of these and you guys are just riding around on it for fun??? And they went off on me, same way this guy did - "YOU CANT TELL US WHAT TO DO" - I just threw my hands up, kept on walking.

I get to the checkout lane, waiting in the only line they have open - when sure enough that kid that was driving one - crashed into a display right next to me, knocking over a fuck-ton of shit. The parents response? Not no, "I'm sorry" or "oops" or anything even remotely fucking human - they just walked away. WALKED AWAY - cart and all. Leaving all that shit.

My Kroger also has a self-checkout lane, but because I had so much stuff I decided to wait in line. So during my long wait, those 2 women who screamed at me for telling them what to do - they checked out right as I was finishing bagging my groceries. I walk outside and they are plugging it in, one talking to the other about how they better hurry - they're going to miss their bus.

Seriously, that was the most frustrating grocery trip I've ever had. I've never felt like a racist before until that moment - because it dawned on me. Out of the 5+ offenders, they were all black. Loud, and ignorant, and black. And the lady who didn't have a cart who actually needed one? White. I seriously wanted to punch those people, especially the cunt black family that crashed the cart into a display, and the poor white Kroger employee just walked over and started picking it up - like it happens all the time. 

I'm never shopping again on the 1st of the month - seriously. It made my blood boil, the whole thing.

 I can't wait for the day when things stop being about black white and yellow and brown and all that stuff and we can just call assholes, assholes. This black guy pisses me off. I'm a black guy and if I call this idiot out, I'm considered someone that's sucking up to white people, by other white people here on reddit. It's already happened multiple times. When you're a black guy and you call out the retarded behavior of other black people instead of prtending it's reasonable behavior, you're called a coon and a sellout by the same black people do this stupid shit.

And all you white middle class liberals need to snap out of this delusion that it's only a hand full of black people like this guy in this video. Take it from someone who knows. a huge percentage of black people have this guy's fucked up mentality. 75% of black mothers are single (the reason why would make this post even longer) and these guys (including myself) are raised by these women alone so they have to over compensate by acting more aggressive and masculine.I got lucky because my family comes from the country and not the inner city. My mother got her masters degree and became a college professor. I went to private school for the first few years of my life and then got an almost culture shock when I went to public school in the 2nd grade (we were never rich or even middle class, but lower middle class. my mom had to retire early after getting really sick, though she's doing well now). Kids in private school were mostly polite. The "bad kids" were just class clowns at worst. But then in private school, all the kids were cursing and using the N-word left and right. There were fights every other day, and I'm pretty sure in like 3 or 4 instances from 2nd to 5th grade there was always that one student who had to sit by himself near the teacher's desk and he clearly needed to be in a special needs class.

My point is that there are a ton of shitty black people out there and there are a good bit of great black people. The same goes with asian, white, latino, etc etc. When a black asshole is being an asshole, everyone should be able to call him or her out on it without being a white racist or a black sellout. Yes, racism exists, but if we're going to move forward we need equality on all fronts. I actually like it if a white person can disagree with me and argue about something and call me out on something if I'm doing something stupid in person, because they're speaking to me in the same way they'd speak to a white person that did the same thing. But when they decide to talk down to me like I didn't know any better because I'm "just a dumb child like black person" and just pretend like I've done something valuable it's irritating. We'd should not be treated like retarded children who don't know any better. That's not going to fix "racism"

 Perhaps more than any other filmmaker in recent years, Christopher Nolan has a following. These so called "Nolanites" love to tout the brilliance of his films, and one of the most popular statements has been to call Nolan a modern Kubrick. Despite being a big fan of Nolan i've never quite understood this statement, especially considering Nolan's visual style does not have much in common with Kubrick's. But I think it goes beyond that, and after seeing Interstellar it finally clicked for me what the biggest difference is: Nolan's films lack subtext. It really is that simple. For whatever reason, Nolan wants his characters to say exactly what they are thinking at any given time. If a character is mad at another character, they will state it plainly. The same goes for every single emotion. There is no misdirection, lying, innuendo, or nuance. It's as if Nolan wants to make sure we understand what the character is feeling and doesn't trust us to infer it by context. This doesn't just relate to character feelings, but also to plot and theme. Look at the ending of Interstellar. When he gets to the weird Library near the end, we get it. We're literally seeing it happen. We don't necessarily understand how it's happening, but we do understand what is happening. Despite this, Nolan decided to have McConaughey and Chastain both state out loud to themselves what is going on, multiple times. Why? We already see what's happening, why exactly do we need the characters to awkwardly reinforce it by talking to themselves? This is especially interesting when you compare this scene to the ending of 2001, a film that Nolanites have been trying to compare to Interstellar since the film was first announced. In that famous ending to 2001, Kubrick doesn't explain anything. He just presents it, and leaves the meaning up to your own interpretation. This forces you to think about the film and what was happening, and is key to why the film is so iconic all these years later. This is night and day different from Nolan's approach to a similarly bizarre event. Nolan chooses to explain it numerous times, just incase we were sleeping I guess, and the ultimate result of this is that we get it. There's nothing to solve, and we leave the theater not questioning "oh what did that mean?" but instead saying "huh, that was interesting" and then proceeding to realize all the plot holes in the film. I admit I was in the crowd of people that was really hoping Nolan would finally "grow up" and make a picture that treats the audience with respect, but after seeing Interstellar i've realized he's just not that kind of filmmaker. Which leads to me the "why that's ok" part. You know what? I really enjoyed Interstellar. It was a blast and one of the most enjoyable theater experiences i've had this year. Despite being 2h49m, which is actually longer than 2001, I never felt bored for a single moment. This is the great skill of Nolan...he makes the most enjoyable blockbusters out there. And I accept that. I no longer wish for him to "grow up", because I actually really enjoy seeing his films. Sure, I don't think about them much afterwards and I will never put them on the same level of the great filmmakers, but for pure entertainment nobody does it better right now than Christopher Nolan, and for that I will always be a fan. 





















































































































































 Bravo Carrey! Brillent. Rely brillent. 

































































































































 Spoilers obviously, but the shot where Nolan ends his film with the platform rising up with Robin inheriting Batman's lair is exactly the same as Mad Max: Fury Road's ending where Furiosa is raised on hte platform to inherit Imortan Joe's lair. 

Bravo Nolan. Bravo Miller.  




 Agree or disagree idc.

Edit: And I don't mean a thriller or black comedy, but no black people. I mean make it Hor ror.

 Reddit is hopelessly in love with talking about itself.  




 Allow me to submit for your fair-minded consideration the following "news diff" of a recent article from the venerable New York Times. Compare and contrast, if you will, these two timestamped versions of the "same" story on Ellen Pao's resignation from Reddit:

[Comparing: Its Silicon Valley 2, Ellen Pao 0: Fighter of Sexism Is Out at Reddit](http://newsdiffs.org/diff/934341/934454/www.nytimes.com/2015/07/11/technology/ellen-pao-reddit-chief-executive-resignation.html)

Now you may not care about the goings on at Reddit, but be that as it may, this shoddy piece of yellow journalism perfectly exemplifies the *narrative* that pervades so much of today's news. What was once a merely slanted article entitled "Ellen Pao Is Stepping Down as Reddits Chief" was swiftly replaced by an outright propaganda piece painting Pao as a heroic but embattled warrior for equal rights in the midst of that oppressive white boy's club we call Silicon Valley, wherein she "fell victim" to the overwhelming sexism and racism which is both inherent to the tech scene and rampant among the vile Reddit userbase. Of course nothing could be further from the truth, yet an "op-ed" label somehow escaped this nakedly biased writeup.

In reality, Ellen Pao "fell victim" only to her own poor decisions, her own incompetence, her court-documented history of abusing coworkers and subordinates (male and female), her and her husband's shady grifter past of long-cons and frivolous discrimination suits seeking outrageous payoffs, her being completely out-of-touch with the very community she was brought in to manage, her intentionally vague and widely reviled initiative to transform all of Reddit into a so-called "safe space" (despite years of drastic increases in censorship across almost all of Reddit), her brazen double-standards in applying said policy to ban specific subreddits while leaving many more hateful, toxic, and rule-breaking subreddits untouched, her lack of desire to use Reddit or even understand how it works (in one celebrated instance, she actually tried linking to a message from her own inbox, like a boss), her off-site PR campaigns in defense of her bad decisions and policies on places like Buzzfeed (reviled by many Redditors) rather than engaging directly with the Reddit community (as challenging as that may be), her callous sacking of popular employees such as /u/kickme444 who ran Reddit's yearly secret santa gift exchange and was reportedly terminated *because he had leukemia... even though he was able to work* (he later deleted his story and said he'd only discuss it with Reddit Inc, so it would seem that Pao's legal team intimidated him into shutting up), and last but certainly not least her reply at a company meeting that "you'll have to pry this position from my cold, dead hands" upon being asked how the search for a permanent CEO was going (as alleged by another former employee). This list actually goes on and on; this was really just a high-level overview to illustrate what an incredible human being she is and what an amazing job she did as the interim CEO of an online community that was anathema to her.

In a word, Ellen Pao was nothing short of antithetical to the core values that Reddit and its community were founded upon and have historically espoused, as Pao herself hinted at when she announced her depature:

 gt; "So why am I leaving? Ultimately, the board asked me to demonstrate higher user growth in the next six months than I believe I can deliver while maintaining reddits core principles."

Although Pao succeeded in alienating the vast majority of regulars that populate the site during her brief stint as CEO, the casus belli leading to her ultimate downfall was her sudden firing of Victoria Taylor, a universally beloved Reddit admin and crucial point of contact for moderators when conducting AMAs. The unexpected and flippant dismissal of Victoria for undisclosed but much-conjectured reasons triggered a sitewide revolt led by the site's moderators, who shutdown most major subreddits in protest of her firing, all culminating in a change.org petition for her ouster skyrocketing from 10k signatories over a few months to over 200k in just as many days. The majority of these moderators are very (if not radically) progressive, often to the point of being called "social justice warriors," meaning it's richly disingenuous to attribute Pao's departure to the clamor of right-wing trolls.

But none of that matters one wit because as everyone knows, Redditors hate nothing so much as they hate women and minorities (except fatties, perhaps). I mean seriously, have you even seen some of the vile names of those awful subreddits they let fester there?! Because if you haven't, the media will remind you of their names, again, and again, and again, as if these purposefully provocative subreddits, whose simmering popularity is first and foremost a result of ever-increasing censorship everywhere else, suddenly represent Reddit if and when anyone from an officially-sanctioned victim class waving a flag of ideological jihad comes under fire for being a world-class shitheel.

Never mind that what set off the final firestorm was the termination of a *female* employee. All of this hate couldn't possibly have anything to do with Pao's shady past, or her shady husband, or her terrible judgement, or her detested policies, or her nasty behavior, or her callous firings, or her ideological hubris, or her embrace of censorship, or her double-standards, or her lack of empathy and communication, or her awful leadership, or a staggering number of other failures. No, it couldn't possibly be any of that because as always, **narrative uber alles**. Now that Ellen Pao has been called a bunch of mean names by an army of anonymous trolls, we're stuck in the "poor Ellen" room, and neither her shady past nor her failures as interim CEO bear repeating nor need be scrutinized.

It's therefore a foregone conclusion that Redditors hated Pao because of her race and her gender and because she was a "fighter of sexism" who became "a hero to many." But what did this "hero" accomplish for women exactly? If firing rockstar female employees, banning salary negotiations, screening job candidates for ideological purity, imposing intentionally vague policies of censorship, and exhibiting all the hallmarks of a Harvard-league grifter before losing a $160 million "landmark" discrimination suit is somehow sufficient cause to be lauded as a brave crusader for social justice in the hallowed tradition of Martin Luther King and Susan B. Anthony, then our brave new world is in very big trouble.

Just how and why Reddit's board of directors selected such an inexperienced, ill-suited lightning-rod for mass-hatred to impose overwhelmingly unpopular site changes during a mere handoff period is anyone's best guess, but what we do know is that the seemingly appalling reactions to Pao's brief reign were anticipated well in advance by most reasonable and knowledgable observers of the situation. What's even worse is that the author of the original NYT article actually sallied forth into /r/KotakuInAction, that villainous hivemind of #gamergate misogynerds, ostensibly to conduct his own AMA, wherein he proceeded to dodge every upvoted question challenging the veracity of his  lt;cough gt; narrative due to these aforementioned pesky facts and inconvenient truths, none of which somehow made it into the revised version of his article:

[I'm Mike Isaac, the New York Times Reporter covering Reddit. AmA.](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3cur16/im_mike_isaac_the_new_york_times_reporter/?sort=top)

As you can see, the NYT wasn't even remotely interested in publishing the truth. In all likelihood, this so-called journalist merely stopped in to troll for hate speech and retreated upon finding himself incapable of inciting any salacious tidbits fit to be plastered over his next edition of agitprop masquerading as journalism. But that's just supposition, meaning it's something I would never publish as fact unless I were, you know, a journalist for the New York Times.

But wait, there's more! Here are some other shining examples of unvarnished journalistic integrity, starting with the highly esteemed Guardian:

Credit where credit is due though, NPR surprisingly ran a [relatively even-handed piece](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/07/10/421877979/ellen-pao-out-as-reddit-ceo). Let's just hope it stays that way.

Now I'm not saying that Pao didn't receive a huge outpouring of crude and spiteful messages, which she clearly did. But somehow I never saw any of these supposed death threats. Yes, there were some death wishes, but let's not conflate "eat shit and die" with "I'll murder you and your family." Such fine details, unfortunately, didn't deter Sam Altman of Reddit's board of directors from dutifully and publicly shaming the Reddit community over their supposed death threats, as though hate mail to polarizing figures in the public eye is unheard of, and as if any would-be murderers reading his patronizing bromide could be dissuaded from sending death threats in the first place. But of course that was not the point of his handwringing exercise in public relations.

Altman's finger-wagging screed in hand, the media had all it needed to run with the narrative that Redditors are literally terrorists, ie. #gamerate redux. And boy did they run. All of these histrionic hyperbolae and identity politics and psychodramas are part and parcel of the media's stock in trade, which is why all of this was predicted well in advance by those following the situation, many of whom are by now all too familiar with its played-out professional victim routine. Manufactured outrage and clueless moral panic from the mainstream media are nothing new to those of us who have lived and breathed old-school internet culture most of our lives. We never forgive and we never forget such classics as: *DOOM caused Columbine. Anonymous: hackers on steroids. Over 9000 penises. Pool's closed. The hacker known as 4chan. #Gamergate*. And so on, and so forth, and so the dragon must be slain over and over and over again, even in our present, supposedly internet-savvy age. Most disturbing of all is that with each manic news cycle, the dragon only grows larger, nastier, and more adept at dividing our society against itself to devour piecemeal both our liberties and our capacity for meaningful and authentic dialog.

 Submission History: The story of two Twenty-something kids, who are basically an internet version of True Detective, and their voluntary mission to hunt pedophiles.  





























 I have to watch 11-11-11 tonight. I've heard the score, but I never saw the movie.  




 You gotta talk about what it's like working with Joseph Bishara tomorrow. I'm really curious about what his work process is like. 




 Reliable Sources is a media commentary show. They can say pretty much whatever they want as long as they don't blatantly say something false like Bill O Riley reported 4 wars with a pen. 




 It is. Yishan is a guy known to fuck.

 I just ate some mac and cheese. 




 Rob Zombie's next film is a bio pic period piece. Which is a weird thing to think of but that's how it be. 




 I wonder if M. Night is just riding the coattails of found footage to say later that his movies still bring in tons of money? Considering the low cost-high reward nature of these shit films it's pretty much written in the stars that his movie is going to make money. 




 Fuck. Minions 2 is gonna happen.

Is Insurgent considered a flop? That was a pretty fucking boring movie to make double its budget instead of three times it.  




 Le-Zank-Mema 




 "Nigga, the G is silent" - says the white kid from Long Island.  




 I said it the way he thought it was pronounced out loud. Now, I'm wondering if anyone ever told him publicly that he's wrong or just let it go.  




  After that movie came out and people saw the female leads doing badass shit with the male lead, they freaked out.

Not just any ol' women. Fucking 40 and 80 year old women doing their own stunts. I, for one, welcome an age where the only thing old people have to do on screen is sit in a hospital bed and say parting words.  




 Thor becomes a women and nerds are apoplectic that women are about to take the whole thing. This is the same debate as Iggy Azelea and Macklemore in Hip-Hop.  




 If you listen to hip-hop and believe that issues of race don't exist, then you probably don't listen to hip hop.  




 When did Jay become handsome? 




 Are you sure you didn't get "Deranged" and "Comedies" mixed up with that last one? 




 I'm also happy that dc's movies look like movies. Marvel has a problem with their stuff looking like a TV set. 




 I can't believe he didn't look into the camera and wink.

 Well, there's a difference between censorship and the shenanigans from that Jesse Jackson AMA.

I think the mods would be well in their right to curate quality questions that don't make us look like a bunch of rabid dogs like "You're a well known race-baiter and huslter. What's it like knowing your the worst thing to happen to race in 60 years."

 I imagine it wouldn't look good with these two possible headlines.

"Former Reddit Employee with Cancer sued by Reddit for Breach of Non-Disclosure"

or

"Ex-Reddit Employee Fakes Cancer Claim to Blame Female CEO for Firing" 

This is what I was aiming at. Reddit is basically gonna make themselves like fools if they take action either way. It's better to let it slide...that is. Unless...Yishan wants to be responsible for some popcorn. 




 [It sounds like he doesn't give a shit anymore](https://twitter.com/yishan/status/619657668261601280) 




 [This popcorn keeps coming. I can't handle it.](https://i.imgur.com/NvhhMqC.jpg) 




 Basically it means that Yishan can freely beat around the bush and Reddit can't really do much. But I was talking about the inevitability that Reddit would go after Yishan for making innocuous statements about how Reddit handled a very public situation because of a nondisclosure provision. I don't even know if he signed one. He would probably have been the one to make the decision on whether to have one. 

It would make Reddit look worse to their user base who will see Yishan as a whistle-blower and in the press because those statements from Yishan are going to get signal boosted. I imagine that if push comes to shove, and with Yishan's tendency to not take shit like that sitting down, we're going to find out in the near future whether the "cancer" statement is true or false.  




 Between this and his public outburst against that shit-talking ex-employee (that was him, wasn't it?) he seems to be an extremely unprofessional individual.

The weird thing about Reddit is that it allows former employees to air their grievances out and corporate has no way of confirming or denying the accusations. Imagine what would have happened if Yishan never responded and just decided to let that simmer. Intimidate public opinion would shift because a Reddit employee says he was fired indiscriminately. 

Yishan basically kicked it in the balls instead of becoming one of those lightening rods for Reddit to seethe at. And then the process repeated itself during the Ellen Pao era, except corporate handled it properly by not putting itself in the area of divulging the nature of someone's employment history. 

All this means is Yishan is clear now to pop some corn around Reddit's offices.  




 Granted that I have no idea what the terms of this guy's termination were, but I can't imagine they didn't include nondisparagement and nondisclosure provisions. And now, in the litany of things that people who are anti-Pao like to rattle off at the merest mention of her, "fired a guy for having cancer" and "pry this position from my cold, dead hands" are regular features.

Think of the position Yishan puts Reddit corporate in now that he said this and KickMe said there's dirt on people and Yishan is going all "fuck it" on Reddit and Twitter.

Reddit is basically one of those justice scales right now and Yishan just tipped it in favor of the transparency set that make Reddit's most vocal members. If Reddit attempts to go after Yishan for just poking around the bush, they're gonna piss off that user base, who'll go fucking nuts and they already got through pissing them off just a few weeks ago.  




 They fired their last PR handler.  




 Ellen Pao and Yishan are friends. Now that they're both out, the gloves are gonna come off. I wonder how this is going to get reported in the press? Ooooooo...this is getting gooooood.  




 Yishanzai! 




 Yishan is the Kernel of Popcorn. And the best part was he ran the company so he's got good shit to air out. It's not like he's entirely wrong, but damn this dude just loves to talk about inside company stuff.

Oh, what a day. What a lovely day! 




 Looks kinda boring.  














 This movie will end up being about The Wolverine again somehow.  




 I would like to see one of these talks with both the directors of Narco Cultura and Cartel Land talking to each other. They both bring up similar issues and I think it probably would lead to a fascinating discussion.  




 Very, very interesting talk. It's interesting to hear the dichotomy between the two subjects of the film. I wonder why with the amount of defense spending that none of it finds its way to the border? This seems like a massive oversight.

I imagine cartels are smart enough not to cause violence on American soil. They probably realize that if they did that would basically mean the beginning of the end of that kind of access to the border.

 I've read Michael Gibney's [Sous Chef](http://www.amazon.com/Sous-Chef-24-Hours-Line/dp/0804177899) which tells a similar story. I gather Anthony Bourdain's Kitchen Confidential is in the same vein, but essentially what I gather is that you get 3 hours to prepare for lunch, one hour for break and dinner prep and the rest of the night being behind on orders. Did you ever work in a kitchen with the ambition to become a head chef? From my experience reading these books they're either treated like war narratives or ones where people had the ambition to become head chefs and own their own restaurants. 

Have you thought of starting a sub reddit with the ability to tell all those stories? I'm having a hard time wondering why you mod the subs you mod, bothering with the metaverse and other unsavory subs to put it lightly, and yet you still refer to the guys you worked with as a second family. 




 How did you recognize Reynoldo Rey from 227? I don't think he would even recognize himself from 227 if he was alive. I know you have a history on Reddit but I kind of want to hear more about these kitchen stories. Most interesting customer? Weirdest things that happened in the kitchen?

Also, favorite things to prepare? You said you like cooking and fishing so I'm guessing you like preparing fish on occasion? 




 Do you have any stories to share about cooking? Favorite thing to cook? Worst dish prepared? Worst customer served? You worked in the cooking industry presumably so what's life like on the other side from your perspective? 




 Okay, fine, if you won't answer that question then I won't get into a prolonged battle.

Do you have hobbies?

What are your top 10 favorite books? 

Do you at least recognize that some of the stuff you say is problematic? 




 We ask that you embrace Reddit's diverse culture rather than cleansing it. We get our touchy-feelies on Facebook. We come to Reddit to be reminded that life can be harsh.

Well, there's your problem. James Cameron has to be the least prolific blockbuster director around in his tier next to George Lucas.

 If you can't attack the proof, then attack character. Exactly what I'd expect. This is a sub for intelligent discussion, you don't want it fine, go somewhere else. 

The original claims were: 

1.  Only comments criticizing her incompetence and/or equating her to fascist leaders. 

2.  There are so many people who keep ranting about the racism/sexism, but provide no evidence of these accusations. 

I provided proof of both, twice. Unless you can refute the claim I really don't need to entertain the bunch of childish baby responses I woke up to saying "cunt isn't really sexist, we we just posting we wanted to punch this cunt in the face but it was in the appropriate subreddit! That has nothing to do with gender." Fucking hell, I have one right below you resorting to bromides and un-sourced bullshit.  









  Stop being pedantic. 

Would you prefer I don't treat your comment with the respect you expect it to be given and just say "hurr durr pedatic, ur wrong?" I can't pick out the "spirit of your comment" when it's wrong because the comment that started this conversation was over the fact that someone was denying that any activity whatsoever of sexism occurred let alone made it up to the front page.

For instance, out of all the signatures that signed the Ellen Pao petition the [numbers on the words "Cunt" and "Bitch"](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/3cfpoa/word_cloud_of_reddits_ellen_pao_petition_oc/) out pace regular prepositions. And this is out of all participants who commented on the petition. Unfortunately, I don't think they're calling her a "cunt" because they know her personally and therefore can attest to the validity of any of these statements. If you want more fun selections from Reddit's grand petition [enjoy the video from the guy who did the data-mining on it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8IIey7vydM)

In comparison to reddit's 160 million unique monthly visitors, they are a minority. A vocal minority, to be sure, but they represent around 0.1% of the reddit userbase, assuming that every one of those subs is an active, unique user (and they aren't all active and unique).

160 million users of which the [overwhelming majority is male](http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/social-gender/465979). And which an overwhelming majority of that majority managed to launch a large organized temper tantrum resulting in a CEO stepping down making their "DAE Pao is literally Hitler" campaign seem legitimate. Did [Yishan end up getting this treatment when he banned The Fappening?](https://np.reddit.com/r/fuxtaposition/comments/3c1bn6/ellen_pao/) (NSFW). [Did this occur when Yishan instituted policies at Reddit that banned Jailbait?](https://np.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplehate51/comments/39on4t/ellen_paos_cunt_very_nsfw/) (Also NSFW). 


But if you want more proof you really just need to compare the statements of Steve Huffman who essentially rephrased the same policies of Ellen Pao and the responses from the same audience who actively went out of their way to downvote her responses into the thousands. Ultimately, this is a conversation about the pernicious nature of these communities that eventually turn their giant crybaby campaigns into organized efforts to take over the community center. The question becomes do you want these guys (the people who don't contribute or enjoy becoming apart of communities) to be able to take over the community center by rushing from their dank basement and taking a baseball bat to good communities, which seems to happen with regularity now, or does Reddit take the stance that allows free association to also include the ability of free exclusionary measures to weed out those pernicious actors?  They can't have it both ways. 

Not many calls for Huffman as being literally Hitler when he said he wouldn't bring FPH back or that he wanted Reddit to be a safe place for all sorts of communities. Then again this is a different conversation. 

 




 Hugh Jackman looked real burned up about not having a seat. 




 Probably because Sam Raimi pretty much can't top the terror of the first one so he jumped ship and made a three stooges comedy film. It's a remake and yet it's basically a whole new take on a film. 

However, I think that Evil Dead remake is on par with the original. Aaron Motion should be a bigger name in the field of cinematography, but his work on that film is brilliant.  




 I don't know. It's hard to pull off a massive science fiction fantasy and those aren't really a dime a dozen with the kind of production values that The Fifth Element has. I wouldn't say it's perfect, but I think it's damn near close for me to perfect. 




 The Big Lebowski. I've watched it like 3 times and I never understood why people find it so knock down drag out hilarious.  




 Best scene was when they blew up the cat. Other than that, it's a pretty okay vigilante movie that borrows heavily from Michael Bay looking camera work.

 SRD got hit with the accusation that we collectively dogpiled the Dylan Storm comment in Pao's resignation announcement to -700. This must be a new achievement.  




 its a fucking internet site. get over yourself.

A rare moment of self-awareness in a sub devoted to a giant temper tantrum.  




 Shit, it's gonna lead to so many "MODS ARE CENSORING ME" that mods would probably just shut down the sub.  




 The creators I'm talking about literally run all the defaults and the thousands of other medium and small sized subreddits. None of these people are employees of Reddit and they had the power to shut down the subs that account for a lions share of its traffic and Reddit couldn't do jack shit without pissing off even more users. It's insane how much power Reddit corporate has given over the main subs that drive traffic. 

The entire point of Reddit is that you can create the subreddit you want, curate the community you want to have, with no restrictions.  Unfortunately, users seem to believe this entitles them to undermine creators intent by saying that they want the ability to freely post anything if it means posting it, having it removed by a moderator, but still having it be there. You've just removed the ability for moderators to do their job of curating a subreddit, which is exactly what they do thanklessly for free while going about the other obligations of their daily life. 

If moderators at /r/askhistorians want to curate a subreddit that aims to be like a historical journal why would you remove their ability to do that by taking their power away to deal with comments and users that undermine the sub? If I'm an editor of a sub that aims to the editorial standards of The New Yorker, then I don't want a bunch of one line posts about "DAE broken arms jolly racher chris nolgan?" clogging up my pages. But if you want to make a sub that allows that, the Reddit gives you the ability to do so. The issue here is users not realizing the power of editorial decision making is only a click of the button away. Outside of that it becomes a discussion about getting eyes on shit that the moderators didn't want in their subreddit and users complaining about censorship because they weren't able to hijack an audience for what usually are bunk causes.

And I'm overthinking it because these are the issues that will arise. Thinking about it makes sure a policy doesn't go into effect that will drive people away from the site before they make a mistake in implementing it.  




 The part that I enjoyed about his AMA was that he essentially said that they have 50 million to burn through which he thinks means that he has no real expectation to deliver on monetizing those investments. It's gonna get real sticky when they run low on cash and those investors start getting antsy. 




 Because you're taking away the power of moderators and creators of subreddit to create the subreddit they wanted. People seem to misunderstand that Reddit is a place for creators, by creators and made with the purpose that you would curate the experience you want to create. 

If you take that power out of the moderators hands then you're basically asking for all sorts of things that you didn't want. The moderators of these quality subreddits have no obligation to stay and tolerate it. 

You already have moderators here clamping down on shitposts. Can you imagine placing new rules that would ensure higher quality posts and then having the company who tells you to do whatever you want and create the subreddit experience you want that you now have lost that power?  




 The next CEO is just going to be a guy in Costa Rica with no publicly listed address and nameless issuing out draconian orders.  




 I mean all the criticisms that have been leveled against it have already been talked about about. Pretty much taking out the Poison Snake lady and the plot about the Silver Samurai and just making it a "Wolverine Vs the Yakuza" story would have shot that movie right to one of the best comic book films.  




 You won't concede even when I do provide sources, because you're part of this hate movement.

Besides, you already lost the debate a couple of messages ago via a fallacy.

We're done here.

I guess he doesn't have any???? 




 Hundreds of games, books, plays, movies, and events got censored or cancelled or disrupted by SJWs.

wut?????? 




 And I feel like Scorsese wouldn't even include his all important "voice of a pufferfish from Shark Tale" that is essentially to completists.  




  I don't think anyone is saying that there hasn't been any sexism or racism directed at Ms. Pao. 

The original commenter said both that he had seen no posts in the postive numbers that were racist and that "there are so many people who keep ranting about the racism/sexism, but provide no evidence of these accusations."

These are both patently wrong statements which negates yours saying there hasn't been anyone denying that Redditors really shit the bed on this one. And one only has to look at the response when Yishan stepped down as CEO. He was the one behind the banning of both Jailbait and The Fappening and yet my front page was not flooded with babies calling the CEO a cunt, "a gook" and "this fucking bitch."

The complaints against Reddit are valid, but not when you have these type of people attempting to hijack a conversation about the fact that Reddit didn't really give a shit about interacting and communicating with the community that keeps its doors open. And these aren't minority numbers. These are thousands of people as the screenshots show. FPH had 150,000 subs, KiA has 40,000, SRC has around 10,000 and all these people keep giving the community a shit name. Meanwhile, cunt wasn't something thrown around when Yishan did the exact same measures against subreddits like Ellen Pao did. 

 




 How many heads do you have? I need to know to adequately prepare my information for the heads that watched it and the heads that didn't. 




 I meant it would ruin your day to have to go through all the hoops of legal action, as justified as they would be.

"Why can't I just grope all the women I want, man? Your trying to arrest me, you know, ruins the rest of my day."

I hope none of these people become lawyers. They're gonna put a lot of their clients in jail.  




 I imagine they would have more hilarious shots of Dennis Leary looking like someone showed him a squirrel nutsack. 




 I enjoy your backpedaling.

"There's no evidence of sexism or racism"

"Oh, well, cunt is really a term of endearment."

"Oh, well, calling someone a gook isn't racist."

I don't know what you're looking for, but it seems like when presented with evidence you just want people to keep giving it to you until it's a mountain full of it. Then when there's none left to give you'll go, "SEE! I told you. No sexism or racism."

 It's probably a more auspicious event for Tarantino, who will hand the power of dictating musical emotion to Ennio Morrecone, than it is for Morricone to score it.

Morrecone is basically the Eric Roberts of film scoring. He does like seven or eight movies a year, a large work load for his age, if you pay him. He does a ton of weird direct to DVD projects.  




 Why don't they just release an HD trailer?  




 I don't think anyone on /r/movies has seen anything other than comic book movies, Christopher Nolan movies, and an assorted bag of 14 other titles associated with mind fucker filmmakers.  




 It's dehumanising because it breaks people down into races. And I have the nagging suspicion that even if they had had Asians at the forefront of the casting, there'd be complaints that none of them were gay or transsexual or something else.

We're all white on the internet.  









 Oh shit. Batman is in two movies.  




 The Rumpled Shithole

Dick Dickerson and The Castle of the Grotesque. 

The Corn Gorge 

The Meaty Sack

A Repetitious Fingering.  




 
i don't think enough people have seen it because it was a fucking terrible movie, but Identity Thief was pretty much one long mean spirited fat joke after another.  




  And lastly yup, people were right when they were saying thats Robins costume in the backround of the first trailer, and the jokers killed him :(

I hope Jenna Malone is playing the next Robin then.  




 It's weird how uncanny Christopher Nolan and Zack Snyder's aesthetic is to each other.  




 Why does he need a coat? 




  I believe that story line is a middle finger to those who hate man of steel simply for the destruction.

Or it's addressing a story point that even David Goyer seemed to scoff at. Whatever he planned in his original script it didn't seem like that was one of them.  




 And thus the age of DC begins.

It will be a glorious fanboy war.  




 There's something hilarious about watching Henry Cavil walk into congress with that suit shot with all the sincerity of a serial killer movie.  




 Who as time to read articles when you have time to pretend your in an online high school movie with stratified cliques? 




 Mah fathur was a gamur. mah granpappy was a gamur and ur gunna be a gahmur sun. 




 For these people it seems, high school never ended. Some just got a bit more "professional" and pretentious with their bullying

High School. High School never changes.  




 Save your money. For the love of everything that is good.  




 The social justice warriors on twitter are not happy this is being made...

who cares?  









 Probably because all those nostalgic nerds raised on MST3000 and Redlettermedia all think they're Buddy Hackett and then start talking during movies. Then there are the teens. Fuck teens. 




 But they're **"nice guys**" 




 All media lies. All media is corrupt. No one believes even traditional print like the New York Times. Gamergate will not be able to fix games journalism or journalism as a whole. But what it can do is open the eyes of those who care about the truth and continue to be a watchdog of the corrupt.

I'LL BELIEVE ANY REDDIT COMMENT BEFORE I BELIEVE FIRST HAND REPORTING. 














 I love the diminutive ["it was just like four guys doing it."](http://i.imgur.com/k0fws6A.jpg)

 




 "Mom, no, look I'm healthy. You want proof? Let me show you this thing called Reddit. This is what it looks like when people shit the bed." 




 because if they made a horror movie that cost money then it would look like Jurassic World. 




 I wonder what it's like to be DavidReiss666 and have people actively attempting to come after him because he won't let them post 8 hour documentaries about holocaust denials? 




 okay. u got da job? when can you start eating hot dog pizzas? 




 u like hot dog pizzas? 




 mramo 




 DJ Khaled is the Mark Twain of our time. true satire.  




 If there's any justice in this world Adam Sandler would announce Grown Ups 3 on the same release date as Pacific Rim 2. 




 We need a fucking Jaeger airplane. 




 Basically this is going to be the best TV series ever and Starz just found itself a viewer. They better not skimp on all the cool as creature effects.  




 SJW ideology has brainwashed the minds of certain people into becoming part of what can truly be described as a hate group that preaches a type of equality called "inclusivity" in a style which can accurately be described as "deliberately exclusionary".
What they do is strategically hide behind politically correct labels and rhetoric that will safely shield them from the criticism or suspicion of the most uncritical eyes and ears at all times, switching their story and affiliations around as needed to maintain the lies they tell. They hide their true motives behind already accepted norms so they can make power grabs to further their influence by talking about only the "victims" (themselves included of course) of supposed social injustices that just need to be corrected. These messages are generally delivered with a sense of self-apparent urgency due to just how offensive these (s)not at all made up(/s) injustices are.

Meanwhile, more SJWs are tactically suppressing the visibility of anyone who might offer reasoned dissent of the notion that there is even an injustice occurring in the first place. They accomplish this using all manner of strategic manipulation of the flow of information to drown out any signals that contradict the victim narrative, once the move to establish it has commenced. How do SJWs obtain such control over the narrative of a subculture? They accomplish this by being in control of what is both seen and said in the groups they attack, while also policing what everyone not currently under attack by them sees and says as well. What they do is find a group of people who are their own subculture that the rest of the world largely doesn't pay any attention to, and they study it. They decipher what is good about it and what makes it popular while digging for what can be maximally portrayed as not so good about it to learn how that culture's rhetoric can be manipulated on as wide a scale as possible. They find online communities where the most people of this subculture gather, then use their influence to gain positions of power within the subculture's highest ranks, and begin infecting the subculture from all angles with their victim politics campaigns, subtly and over time, until it becomes too much for everyone in it to ignore. All reasonable attempts to subvert or remedy the trend are swiftly denied traction.

The inevitable ensuing outrage is then used to point fingers, framing all the angry outbursts as evidence of how abusive and harassing the people belonging to the subculture are. SJWs spread this falsely reframed narrative as far, wide, and quickly as possible within SJW circles, injecting the accusations into the mainstream's consciousness during the height of the backlash. From there, the trap is sprung, and the helpless true victims of such lies and slander are forced to defend themselves and their values in front of a misinformed public. The controversy builds and builds like a fire the SJWs ceaselessly fan the flames of in order to milk all the sympathetic attention they can exploit from it for profit.

The SJWs do all that, while simultaneously saying the only path to true equality is to denounce, shame, and ruin the lives of these whole subcultures of people who have been successfully framed to look like the very enemies of freedom and liberty the SJW ideology itself actually is. The SJWs patronize all resistance by spinning anything that threatens the narrative into more ammo to keep the narrative going. This results in the targeted subcultures becoming divided, and becoming further splintered over and over as SJWs endlessly harass into silence every last loud voice that cries out in opposition. The end goal is to force what remains of the subculture to conform to SJW ideology.
What SJW ideology doesn't want anyone to understand it seems is that the solutions SJWs choose for correcting any perceived social injustices are purely destructive to the relations of literally everyone involved. In other words, the path to progress as far as an SJW is concerned, is backward while giving third parties the appearance of moving forward. SJWs deliberately alienate the mainstream culture from subculture after subculture in this way to "smash the patriarchy", which according to SJWs, is straight men; the whiter the better.

Every group SJWs have infected have all been accused of misogyny, toxic masculinity, and hostile intolerance of minority groups on one level or another at the first sign of resistance. This effectively drives out all the straight males by demonizing their sexuality as well as by their skin color depending on how highly represented their ethnicity is within the subsculture. This means that SJW ideology is, among other nasty revelations, thinly veiled bigoted hatred disguised as critical moral concerns aimed at men primarily. Given that SJWs believe white people are the most privileged race on earth, it is absolutely racist toward white people too.

In effect, SJW Ideology is a tool for dismantling any subculture that is predominantly male, and they call any resistance during the takeover a hate group while the subculture dies of SJW cancer.

GamerGate is the first group that I have seen that not only hasn't given up, but after being pushed around long enough, they're falcon punching SJW attackers back and gaining ground. This shit is like watching Rocky take a beating in the first couple rounds then come back on his opponent with the eye of the tiger theme song playing in the background. This shit is like watching the entire Freeza saga of DBZ. This shit is awesome.

These messages are generally delivered with a sense of self-apparent urgency due to just how offensive these (s)not at all made up(/s) injustices are.

Meanwhile, more SJWs are tactically suppressing the visibility of anyone who might offer reasoned dissent of the notion that there is even an injustice occurring in the first place. They accomplish this using all manner of strategic manipulation of the flow of information to drown out any signals that contradict the victim narrative, once the move to establish it has commenced. How do SJWs obtain such control over the narrative of a subculture? They accomplish this by being in control of what is both seen and said in the groups they attack, while also policing what everyone not currently under attack by them sees and says as well. What they do is find a group of people who are their own subculture that the rest of the world largely doesn't pay any attention to, and they study it. They decipher what is good about it and what makes it popular while digging for what can be maximally portrayed as not so good about it to learn how that culture's rhetoric can be manipulated on as wide a scale as possible. They find online communities where the most people of this subculture gather, then use their influence to gain positions of power within the subculture's highest ranks, and begin infecting the subculture from all angles with their victim politics campaigns, subtly and over time, until it becomes too much for everyone in it to ignore. All reasonable attempts to subvert or remedy the trend are swiftly denied traction.

The inevitable ensuing outrage is then used to point fingers, framing all the angry outbursts as evidence of how abusive and harassing the people belonging to the subculture are. SJWs spread this falsely reframed narrative as far, wide, and quickly as possible within SJW circles, injecting the accusations into the mainstream's consciousness during the height of the backlash. From there, the trap is sprung, and the helpless true victims of such lies and slander are forced to defend themselves and their values in front of a misinformed public. The controversy builds and builds like a fire the SJWs ceaselessly fan the flames of in order to milk all the sympathetic attention they can exploit from it for profit.

The SJWs do all that, while simultaneously saying the only path to true equality is to denounce, shame, and ruin the lives of these whole subcultures of people who have been successfully framed to look like the very enemies of freedom and liberty the SJW ideology itself actually is. The SJWs patronize all resistance by spinning anything that threatens the narrative into more ammo to keep the narrative going. This results in the targeted subcultures becoming divided, and becoming further splintered over and over as SJWs endlessly harass into silence every last loud voice that cries out in opposition. The end goal is to force what remains of the subculture to conform to SJW ideology.
What SJW ideology doesn't want anyone to understand it seems is that the solutions SJWs choose for correcting any perceived social injustices are purely destructive to the relations of literally everyone involved. In other words, the path to progress as far as an SJW is concerned, is backward while giving third parties the appearance of moving forward. SJWs deliberately alienate the mainstream culture from subculture after subculture in this way to "smash the patriarchy", which according to SJWs, is straight men; the whiter the better.

Every group SJWs have infected have all been accused of misogyny, toxic masculinity, and hostile intolerance of minority groups on one level or another at the first sign of resistance. This effectively drives out all the straight males by demonizing their sexuality as well as by their skin color depending on how highly represented their ethnicity is within the subsculture. This means that SJW ideology is, among other nasty revelations, thinly veiled bigoted hatred disguised as critical moral concerns aimed at men primarily. Given that SJWs believe white people are the most privileged race on earth, it is absolutely racist toward white people too.

In effect, SJW Ideology is a tool for dismantling any subculture that is predominantly male, and they call any resistance during the takeover a hate group while the subculture dies of SJW cancer.

GamerGate is the first group that I have seen that not only hasn't given up, but after being pushed around long enough, they're falcon punching SJW attackers back and gaining ground. This shit is like watching Rocky take a beating in the first couple rounds then come back on his opponent with the eye of the tiger theme song playing in the background. This shit is like watching the entire Freeza saga of DBZ. This shit is awesome. 




 SJW ideology has brainwashed the minds of certain people into becoming part of what can truly be described as a hate group that preaches a type of equality called "inclusivity" in a style which can accurately be described as "deliberately exclusionary".

 Huffman should just put out an address to a public park and host the AMA there. Then we get to see who is actually asking these stupid questions.  




 War has come to AMA.  




 No one wants to go to Voat. It crashes if two users are using it at once. 




 Yeah, and they're fucking babies.

They're free speech warriors and NOW this. I'm just gonna cancel my subscription to Hustler.

 Warner Bros always does cool shit with their logos. The one for Orphan is under rated. 




 It turns out is was one of the old Kodak click scroll cameras.

 Did they let Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian run this Amazon promotion? 




 Same director as those films. A lot of the crew is returning for this too. Pedro Brofman is the composer for this. 




 They chose the right director too. Jose Phadilla of the Elite Squad films.  




 He tried being a lead in tough guy movies and that didn't work out so well. 




 He has jokes for days. DAYS. 




 The century club gang is all there too. 




 Dan owns something called crystal head vodka 




 I KNEW IT I KNEW IT!!! 




 It was nice for 28Dans to do an AMA before the culling of his subreddits.

Maybe he'll finally have time to finally focus on opening a restaurant instead of all that racist garbage. 




 Kotaku in Action is so paranoid that it might bring down a portion of the site just from the threads of them speculating about being cut.

The irony hearing the calls of professionalism from a site that publicly flayed a former CEO with no information by calling her a nazi/fascist/socialist/hilter/cunt. Redditors lost the ability to cast stones.

 I'm pretty sure Yishan just shows up at monster truck rallies on top of the trucks shirtless and shooting guns in the air now. 




  Here's the thing.

 You have feelings and empathy toward other people, a term commonly referred to as "friends?" I don't know.  




 "You SJW"

 Seeing people explain the "definition" of Gamergate because it's hilariously simple but couched in these large rants like eight paragraphs long.  




  Reflecting on this, I also remember him talking about having never kissed a woman and now I think that might have something to do with being an MRA. 

Well, opening a first date with..."you know most rape reports are false" isn't an ice breaker.  




 Adorable.  




 ROBERT DENIRO IS GOOD AGAIN!!! WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE 




 I was nodding my head along and then I read the guy who said "Red pill them."

How the fuck does he plan to do that? 

"Ya know Warren Farrell has some good ideas. You should read Paul Elam." 




 Whenever Yishan comes into a thread, you hear Shoot to Thrill off into the distance and guns going off. His next bomb should be the Leukemia allegation. That's the only real thing left that he needs to disprove because it's still a nasty rumor. But I still hear Shoot to Thrill so he's comin... 




 

This was co-written by the same guy who did Seventh Son sooooooooooooooo.... 




 Considering they apparently had footage of the human side of the war as well. This wasn't really an interesting way to go. It's a sizzle reel, but all I saw was a lot of computer generated walking.  




 Question: If all those guys are under the influence of the guy opening the portal then if they reach the other side wouldn't that mean they're home free and the movies over?

 No Pieta or The Clone Returns Home. I'm sad these don't get more exposure. But there are some new recommendations in between the stuff we know already. 




 Guess Reddit is in the midst of cutting their brotarian ties with Steve and Alexis. 




 It's not a fallacy, it's a documented reality. We like to think we're immune to tyrannies, but the truth is it takes vigilance, and sometimes over-reaction, in order to prevent them. It's a tug of war, and just because we're winning doesn't mean we can stop tugging - the other side sure won't.

Best of Outrage Culture worthy in that Advice Animals Thread.

The conspiracy Yishan PR machine is apparently waking up in that Technology thread: 

Yishan is bitter Pao was thrown under the bus by Alexis and the board. He recommended her for the post, and I will bet half my karma that they have a personal relationship as well. Now he sees the perfect opportunity to get back at Alexis and the board, with some grade A shit posting. Check out some of his previous comments in the past few days, you'll get the gist. No complaints from me though, makes for some excellent popcorn.

Holy hell, this is some prime cookery:

How is that a 'PR spin machine'? That all seems terrible for reddit the company. This isn't PR spin machine, it's someone who is mad and getting revenge by airing the dirty laundry
Its PR for Yishan's cause. I hope he at least gets some of that pussy from all this white knighting.

Now the Reddit celebrities are chiming in. A famous Lizard of War has appeared:

I'm a bit confused, perhaps you can clarify what you mean:

Reddit caused Ellen's departure (you did it reddit!) but Ellen says it didn't and the board confirms.

 - Ellen was all about free speech and fatpeoplehate was only banned for inciting off-site but dozens of parody subreddits were banned after that did nothing off-site and hundreds of people were shadowbanned for criticizing her? Did she know this was happening?

- With Ellen at the helm, Reddit was immune to being criticized for intentionally creating a racist / sexist environment but Reddit is the users, not the corporate structure. How could Reddit, Inc. be criticized for promoting free speech?

 - This entire time you had vital information that could have saved your friend embarrassment and mental anguish but you didn't say anything because of "Executive Privilege?"

I dunno man, this doesn't make sense to me.

The only way this all works in my head is if Ellen was a figurehead with no actual power, had nothing to do with the contradictory decisions made, and you were under some sort of gag-order.

Maybe this was all a giant cluster-fuck of epic proportions and the lack of communication was the result of internal squabbling, but honestly, I love Reddit and I expect better.

 I think the Kotaku in Action/MRA/Coontown network are going to be in denial about what sub reddits are on the chopping block until it comes true.  




 We've seen what "ignoring the subs" cause. It creates Fat People Hate to grow to its bulbous size and when the admins finally decide they've had enough of them, they boot them from the site causing a tidal wave of thousands of seemingly 20 something adults throwing internet temper tantrums. 

Clearly, ignoring and going about your Redditing experience doesn't work. It just allows large concerted efforts to grow a shitty user base to go unabated and then it seeps into other Sub Reddits. If you want to see the affect of ignoring a problem just look at the /r/videos threads where a woman talks about [domestic abuse](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/3cjgit/26_year_old_woman_from_ireland_posts_video_about/) or [isolated incidents at Wal-Mart.](https://np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/3cdhte/walmart_has_the_worst_customers/csuoqq7)

 He did it poorly. I was reading it wondering where his evidence for this is other than himself. I basically read his complains almost everyday on comments on /r/videos. I don't need to read another gripe about "trigger Warnings" unless he explicitly states why a small citation at the beginning of a class is suddenly ushering in some Stalinist regime. 




 She was also married to Harold Pinter. I believe she wrote a memoir about her life with Pinter. 




 There was some problem with the legality of creating your own currency if I remember. 

That was the reason that guy canned. Also he wanted to write it in some ridiculous language, I think Java script was what was being thrown around.

  You'd be shocked at how many people hate askhistorians because they think their right to shitpost is more important than having actual historians answering questions in the sub

Their right to dank memes and holocaust denial is important. They need an audience to legitimize it. 




 Just google Yishan Wong Twitter. he's the one who create the "I don't need this bullshit ex-CEO" club. 




 They'd probably shut down the sub anyway like Thanks, Obama did.

 What was it like working with Joseph Bishara? Can you talk about the process of scoring a movie with him?

 




 "popcorn tastes gud" - Reddit admins. 




 Was there some sort of concerted effort to deny Mark Zuckerberg getting sickening comments from Facebook users with his various updates to private policy? I'd like to see those articles.

[Kickme444](https://np.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/3d2hv3/kn0thing_says_he_was_responsible_for_the_change/ct1fczz) stated on Theory of Reddit that Pao didn't fire Dacvak for Leukemia. And [it's been confirmed that Alexis fired Victoria](http://thenextweb.com/insider/2015/07/13/former-reddit-ceo-alleges-co-founder-alexis-ohanian-fired-victoria-taylor-not-pao/)

Also, Ellen Pao does not have a board seat. Alexis is still her boss. He was Board chairman and he already admitted to firing Victoria. He just did it in the most sheepish way possible by letting Pao take most of the heat. There are other holes in your essay too. Op-eds are peoples opinions. They are inherently bias. You linked two of them. That's not a sign of media bias. Also, you'd have to prove that there's an end to what the media bias is supposed to achieve here other than "redditors are kinda shitty people."

Secondly, media bias isn't in most of the articles you linked considering most of your linked articles all correctly reported Sam Altman's statements about "sickening" behavior. 

For some reason you brought in this weird men vs women stance while arguing that gender and identity politics don't matter in this case when according to the end statement of your essay, they do?

Finally, Redditors aren't a privileged class of citizen. This is a social media site, we don't get any sort of civil rights here. Most of the decisions alleged to Pao have been refuted by admins and other sources from Reddit. And she did receive an undue amount of shitty behavior from Reddit's user base.  




 Because Reddit has so far had a stellar track record on mob justice...

 Mad Max is the coolest movie ever. 




 The well goes deep. "Sandra Bullock and Halle Berry; Doing Great as Single Moms:"

It is considered a feat to make a marriage work in Hollywood. Celebrity couples due their hectic work schedule, plus the media who constantly poking and over sensationalized a simple circumstance need not to be publicly known and invaded privacy certainly added pressure to the struggling unions of the celebrities and superstars. 

There is an apparent increase of celebrity single parents lists. The most popular alibis are; divorce, new found love, unfortunate passing of their partner and the decision to move forward with becoming a parent in their own right. Recently is Bridget Moynahan, whom Tom Brady left in favor of supermodel Gisele Bundchen. The actress is famous in her role as John Cusack's fiance in the movie Serendipity seems adjusting well to her new solo job a single as mom. 

Sandra Bullock follow through, the actress life-changing year has included an Oscar win, a divorce filing and an adoption. Public was sympathetic to Bullock when news of her cheating husband, Jesse James broke. It is a public knowledge that Jesse James philandering acts prompted Sandra Bullock to file divorce. Sadness was replaced by joy for her elated adoption of her baby boy, Louis Bardo. 

Halle Berry and boyfriend Gabriel Aubrey heading to Splitsville and are now reportedly battling over custody of their daughter, Nahla. The gorgeous actress has a very rocky and public love life. Her recent split from boyfriend Gabriel Aubrey, and father of her daughter, Nahla seemed amicable at first, but there had been a change in the direction of the wind as the two are embroiled in a custody battle. 

Kudos to all single parents, celebrity or not. Your toil deserves great appreciation. And one way of showing is through giving mothers jewelry. There is a wide selection of personalized necklaces and personalized jewelry to choose from. So let your creative juices flow and pick a unique mothers gift. 




 Another gem called How to Become Famous Like Justin Bieber:

Do you want to become famous? And do you want to become famous like Justin Bieber did? **Well what if I was to tell you that it's not actually that hard to do?**

Bieber may be too criticized by many but is a great example of what the marketing, social networking and other elements can do.

First Bieber began releasing their videos through YouTube, a platform that has given 5 minutes of fame to many people, but these 5 minutes stretched into years due to other internet tools... Twitter.

If we learn from the biography of Justin Bieber is that if someone wants to become famous, should begin now to put their videos (as real as possible) on YouTube, because you never know who might "accidentally" discover your talent for delight the young fans. 

This is exactly what has happened to Justin Bieber.

Twitter really help Bieber began to attract attention from your target market. Many marketers still do not understand the scope that is Twitter users and yet this was the platform that Justin used to engage with your audience. Justin currently offer your movie called "Never Say Never" (never say never), a type of documentary which presents the story of the singer and how he came to where he is now.

And of course had to take a perfume especially for girls called "someday" but the video is a little weird and may even get you a laugh, in two days has reached the 2 million views. A very good example is Google; that is starting to become obsessed with the pop stars. This search engine company has made a change in its marketing strategy. Last month, he joined Lady Gaga in an ad to show all the opportunities offered by the Chrome browser. Now he has done the same with Justin Bieber.

The announcement is similar to Gaga, but also shares some similarities with the recent announcement Dear Sophie, which shows a father using Chrome and other Google products to remember her daughter's childhood.

It makes sense that Google has thought Bieber for their promotion. The young celebrity was discovered thanks to his performances uploaded to Youtube. And with it, Google manages to reach an important demographic: teenage girls.

One of his secrets: Its well-defined market.

Justin Bieber is not intended that all are his fans; he knows it would be almost impossible, yet the market for young girls have it well controlled. So it adds the elements of marketing, good use of digital tools and a well-defined market and the rest is history.

 More brilliance, a review of No Strings Attached from a paper mill:

The funny can be credited to screenwriter Elizabeth Meriwether, who not only creates lead characters that are likeable, but has surrounded these people with a surprisingly rich supporting cast. There is not token best friend that gets all the lines. There's actually a posse. Natalie Portman's Emma and Ashton Kutcher's Adam are surrounded by friends and co-workers that are very very funny without having to resort to outrageous infantile humor. Heck, they all seemed like they could be any of the inherently funny people that I know in the real world. 

Adam and Emma meet cute as teenagers at summer camp where his sheepish moves on Emma fall flat. The run into each other again at a frat party in college, then again a few years later. As always happens in the movies, they are destined to end up in the same state, in the same town, at the same time. So when drunk and depressed Adam calls every phone number in his cell for a booty call, he ends up waking up in Emma's Los Angeles flat surrounded by her roommates. Emma is now a workaholic doctor, and Adam works as a middling minion in the television business. Emma doesn't have the time or energy for a real relationship, so she proposes that she and Adam become fuck-buddies. What guy would refuse? 

I think it is interesting that there is a string of "no strings attached" sex comedies spilling into the theaters. And they all seemingly have the same twist (which is not much of a twist when they are all the same): In the modern take, it is the guy who falls for the non-committal woman first. But where the similar setup of Love and Other Drugs failed from lack of chemistry between Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway, Natalie and Ashton actually make a cute couple. Their quips seem natural, and even though Emma is a bit over-the-top bristly whenever she thinks she is being conned into a relationshippy-type moment, she is still appealing. And who doesn't like to see Natalie Portman have an occasional potty-mouth moment? That's right. We all like a smart girl that swears. 

No Strings Attached does falter a bit. It struggles with momentum toward the end as it falls into the predictable territory of whether or not these lovers should also be together for realz. Hollywood does always want the perfect kiss at the end. But until then, I was totally enjoying the ride. Along with great supporting turns by Greta Gerwig, Mindy Kaling, and Lake Bell (along with more awkward appearances by Kevin Kline and Cary Elwes), No Strings Attached is funny escapism with a great cast that won't leave you feeling cheated after your two-hour fling at the movies. 




 More gems from a genuine paper mill producing top notch film criticism:

They're wicked and foul with the stench of 40,000 years. But what would movies be without them? While most are truly quite horrific, others are actually funny. But throughout the many years of cinematic history, one fact has always remained constant about movie villains... we love to hate them. 

Heroes get all the hype, but deep down, we all love a good villain. I can take or leave the square-jawed boy scout, the do-gooder who gets the girl and saves the day; but the villain is a different kettle of genetically modified laser wielding fish altogether. 

Funny Villain have more fun and get most of the best lines. Movie history is littered with fiendish foes, evil overlords and malevolent masterminds we loved to hate. The summer blockbuster is the perfect breeding ground for evildoers and this year's pageant of box office behemoths provides rich pickings, from robots out for revenge to muggle-hating wizards. 

Cinema is filled with memorable villains. Whether it's the sardonic cheer of Gert Frbe's Auric Goldfinger, or the sneering oiliness of Die Hard's Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman), the movies are full of superb, loveably evil performances. The hero may get the girl and save the world in most instances, but it's the villain who gets most of the quotable lines. 

It's like the alignment of the planets. Occasionally, a great director, an exemplary script and a gifted actor will join together on the same project, creating the kind of unsettling performances that linger in the memory for years afterwards. 

Michael Mann's 1986 adaptation of Thomas Harris' novel Red Dragon was the first movie to bring cannibalistic academic Dr. Hannibal Lecter (in this instance spelled Lecktor due to rights issues) to the big screen. 

Robert De Niro chews both characters and scenery in a manic performance as Max Cady, an ex-convict who terrorises lawyer Sam Bowden (Nick Nolte) for apparently failing to defend him effectively in court fourteen years earlier. 

An indifferent and Funny movie villains can be threatening as a villain with an almost cartoon-like evil uniform like Jason Vorhees from Friday the 13th. In The Matrix (1999), the army of 'faceless' agents are cold and emotionless and suggest an unbeatable threat with which the hero cannot reason or negotiate. 

The all-powerful emotionless villain is portrayed excellently in the X-Files TV series by William B. Davis as the Cigarette Smoking Man. Throughout the series he is constantly in control of the heroes and any attempts to kill him are deemed self-destructive or futile. His power over the protagonists' behaviour is linked to his role in the Syndicate, a mysterious organisation who seemingly are more powerful than the U.S. government. 

On the opposite end of the scale are the villains that are emotive, excitable and with exaggerated personas as demonstrated by Heath Ledger's villain in the most-recent Batman film, The Joker. The latest incarnation of the Clown Prince of Crime perfectly conveys his lack of empathy and almost-humorous contempt for human life. The most prominent aspect of The Joker is his colourful clothing and unusual physical appearance, with white face make-up, dyed green hair and smudged red lipstick.

 This is a film which involve sex industry. Sometimes I think I would rather to catch a triply to watch than to sleep with a dull man, Because each set is very short, it probably still can give you the climax, even it is a neuter version. I still remembered that I really did't think Belle is a beautiful woman when I watched season one. But I have been able to appreciate her beauty to season four. I like to watch her to receive each customer in high spirit. She let me become more believe that there is some people really like to be a prostitute as career. From her, I felt a little shamed, I just in labor, I didn't work hard.but she does't. 

Ben and Han is alike,both are brave,Both have the courage to make a choice, choose what they want, rather than they should.From the start, Ben appeared in Han's world, his state cannot be removed. From season one Ben delayed he and Vanessa' s wedding ceremony, at that moment, I knew he was really love Han.real love. But they finally broke up. Ben wants a family,but Hannah cannot give. just because she know she cannot give,she choose to leave. Hannah just wants to be herself.They separate,not because they don't love each other, they are too love.they love, but cannot give each other they want. So they say goodbye. Losing Ben, it means, Hannah and bell lose everything, but she finally decide so. love, like on you. 

In fact, I know they will not be together at last, but I still hoping. Finally I having no choice but to Give up the lens. Sometimes. Two people who love each other deeply always can not be together. That's it. If it's you. Would you do as Hannah. Choose to leave because love too much. When you can't give your lover what he needs. When you can't let him be happiness. choose to leave is more great than to possess him.

 Holes. by the ending they dug a lot of holes.  




 I have a feeling that our next batch of conservative politicians are going to be former Redditors and the debates are going to be even more entertaining because SJW, White Guilt and Triggered Tumblrnas are going to be said on national television with sincerity.

 It was Bernie Sanders. YOU'RE NOT GETTING AWAY FROM HIM THIS TIME.

 Wow. Digg used to look like Reddit. It's not a bad site now, the curate a bunch of great articles and their subheds on them are  funny. 




 He reported to Ellen Pao, but Alexis is still her boss and Steve Altman is over both of them. Pao didn't even have a board seat.

He's over her and he also admitted to firing Victoria on top of Yishan's clarification. So what's the big deal here? Reddit fucked up. Vigilante internet mobs don't work.  




 What the fuck? She got to taser the fucking mayor for charity? I'm not sure whether living America is awesome or just the most fucked up thing. 




 Make the American Sniper plastic baby CEO of Reddit. 




 Memes. 




 The Band's Visit is an incredible little drama. It's really charming too. 

I would also recommend Lebanon, Ajami, Omar and Bethlehem too.  




 The only guys who are saying this movie is good are the video critics who are already nerds, while I'm seeing general critics who veer toward liking more movies than just comic book ones are finding it meh.

  Maybe F4 just can't be a movie?

They need to hit F4 and start again without Josh Trank. 




 Who wants to bet the villain says "FIND THEM/HIM/HER" as the camera cuts away with a crescendo of music. 




 I realize now why Vin Diesel is the only guy to make that line work.  




 Ae lamaeo 




 Should put a countdown ticker till all that's left is Ohanian and a bag of popcorn. 




 Ohanian was demoted from chair to co-founder with Steve Huffman. Altman is in charge now. 




 Wow, this is filled with tons of bad information. Victoria was fired by Alexis. Kickme444 confirmed Ellen Pao didn't fire that disgruntled guy because he had leukemia. Shit, that's just the start. Why can't Redditors just admit they don't have all the information and put the pitchforks down? You people are terrible at it, but you guy keep instigating. 




 Because the first thing Reddit needs is another anonymous "Whistleblower" so it can go on another witch hunt. 

Also, who the fuck brings guns to a tech job in silicon valley? Is he Hugh Jackman from Chappie? 




 Moderates were powerless. When /r/videos was on a rampage upvoting that caricature of Ellen Pao singing a parody of Keene's "Somewhere Only We Know," I pretty much realized I was watching a train wreck in progress.   




 John Tuturro as a fucking EGYPTIAN PHAROAH! Best Comedy of 2014. Deserves an Oscar for Best Comedy.

 Hot Dog Pizza came out during Paogate. I blame Domino's for this. 




 He used the term "dumb dumbs" to showcase his superior intellect. He's an intelligent person.  




 Hear that? It's the sound of Reddit pedaling backwards. 




 I'm nut ur mister, memester.

 Shit, have we ever been linked in drama? I feel like this is an auspicious first.

 [James Horner did this film for free. He actually paid it out of his own pocket because he loved the father-daughter relationship.](http://www.npr.org/2015/07/17/423899444/in-portrait-of-a-boxer-fuqua-takes-the-action-outside-the-ring)

Southpaw is the last recorded Horner score before the plane crash, the last released score will be for "The 33." 

But Horner actually did something really beautiful. James Horner's team had actually brought Fuqua the completed written score for The Magnificent Seven. You can actually hear in the interview that Fuqua was really touched by Horner's gesture because he didn't do it for money. He just did it because he loved the script. 

It's incredibly touching to hear these stories, especially from Fuqua who you can hear get choked up about it, and hopefully we'll be able to hear Horner's final score.

 Nearly all of today's luxury food started out as peasant food, in fact that's a whole side of high-end French cuisine today. The truth is, we do live in the real world today and lobster is expensive and appreciated as a treat. To throw it in a shitty bun and slather it in crappy tinned dry seasonings and mayo is just a waste because any of the other lesser meats would suffice. That you people can't grasp that is just... pathetic and nationalist, as always.

I wonder if this guy tries his material out on his mom before typing it into Reddit. 




 You know who owns the land ends that are just before the ends of the earth? Sheldon Adelson. He's trying to hide it from the rest of the world, but i know his plans.

 Are they planning of kicking government off the edge of the Earth?  




 I wonder what stopped him from going *over* the borderline to genius level.

 The word offensive doesn't have a definition that everyone agrees on because different things offend different people. It's easy to ruffle people's feathers.

Once, a friend told me about a situation he observed in which a white customer at a grocery store dropped some change into the palm of a black clerk while paying for his food. The black clerk looked the customer straight in the eyes and said, loudly enough for people nearby to hear, "it doesn't rub off, you know."

The black clerk felt put down because she felt that the white customer was avoiding touching her because of her race. That may have even been true, but maybe he was a germophobe and treated everyone that way, or maybe he didn't like touching other people, or maybe he was just being careless because his mind was on other things. We don't know.

The thing is, the customer had no options. He couldn't stand up and say, "excuse me, everyone who just saw that? Could I have your attention? I just want to let everyone know that I'm not a racist," because that would make him look even more like a racist.

In this way, people who are members of groups that are subject to prejudice have a special power to try and convict people in the court of public opinion. They may be sensitive or insecure in ways that are not readily apparent, and there are no defenses available to people who are perceived as members of dominant, majority, or privileged groups.

This happens all the time. Look at male students who have been expelled from universities due to rape allegations without evidence (or even contrary to evidence) for example.

Because society works this way, it can be more dangerous for people who are perceived as privileged to interact with people who are perceived as unprivileged, so I would say that OP has successfully avoided a negative result in what can be a dicey situation.

 THEY'RE THE SAME!?!?!?!?!  




 I've never been to carl, jr. although the biggest best burgers in that bracket of fast food burger is hardees. fucking hardees is great. 




 I never usually see this drama without Robotics man in there. But here he is again. It's like a moth to flames.

I love when negative posts get gilded. The salt comes out. 




 Chipolte is great, but the one thing I never got is the whole "it'll ruin your asshole" thing. I never took any massive shits, but it's a meme whenever Chipolte comes up.  




 I usually ask for half of the rice and double up on the meats. Sometimes I just want a burrito and there's something satisfying about the fact that their ingredients are pretty fresh, you can watch them grill all that shit too, and it all just tastes really good. The guac is pretty fucking stellar. Usually, I just go for guacamole and dip. 




 Lol. Google is so passe. I use this cool thing you've probably never heard of called the phone book. All the cool kids are using one. 




 They've internalized memes. They're meme masters. 




 ad hoc pork bone chop hoc of beef. 




 Classic Ad Hom. Classic.  




 Gillette Razor. I'm smooth. *All over* 




 Classic ad hom. Totally classic ad hom. 




 No Jew Not. 

*snaps fingers vigorously  




 I thought Redditors shit the bed on the Ellen Pao debacle and the guys who run Reddit are trying to out do them by eating a jar of stool softener before shitting the bed. 




 The admins really need training in dealing with customer service. They act like they're part of the rabble.  




 It's going to blow up in his face. Once the moderators see how unmanageable trolls are and they find that they can't actually get rid of them, they're going to either shut down the subs or leave. 

They do it for free and Huffman is literally out there saying, "I'd like to make your jobs harder because I want to read dipshit comments. You no longer have the ability to control how you want your sub to be."

 The biggest problem is that he assumes Reddit is filled with inherently good people willing to bring good discussion to the table. Boy, is he really barking up the wrong tree. 




 I'm pretty sure Steve Huffman is a plant from Facebook to destroy Reddit. 



















 He probably would have been better as the replacement for the Daily Show or maybe a Bill Mahar type round table. 




 God, it's like the worst of Christopher Nolan's scripts just up and came to life and re-arranged themselves into a Frankenstein Dylan Thomas knock-off. 




 Buzzfeed made 100 million last year. Reddit's profit? Just about 8 mill.  




 I, uhhh, can I get on this deal? 




 *Says there's no battle lines

*Goes to KiA

*Everyone is describing shit like All Quiet on the Western Front 




 How much was the budget for ant-man related clothing? 10 million? 




 When I first copied it, he didn't have any line breaks. That's in the archived version. I like the way it is now. It preserves the "original intent." 




 It's the one from Star Trek. I'm having a hard time believing anyone in KiA has a good sense of history anyhow. 




 bait shop? 




 Proving my point, how does this prove in any way shape or form that I am a man baby? What even is a man baby? Someone who wears a diaper on Tuesday nights? Someone who is 27 and watches adventure time while high? Someone who whines a lot ("there are not enough hours in the day")? Ignorant how? Do you claim to have a fair and unbiased viewpoint of both sides? I personally know LGBT people have a shit time, T and B especially (I don't we should place value on how bad certain individuals have it, more of the whole whining about life deal) but we are gradually getting better and the best thing for that is positivity, not negativity and captious behavior. I am not gonna sit and let people tell me that we are getting worse or that there is nothing we can do except point out flaws.

This is the best thing I've read today.  




 If you can't separate someone's actions from their identity and then have the gall to claim any criticism is harassment then you are a miserable excuse for a rational person. Laurlai was the reason this sub was created, because social justice hypocrites were drawing to much hate for lgbt folk with their rhetoric. when your claim to being trans gendered, bi, or homosexual is because of make believe genders or because you want to gain victim status for immunity it's despicable. These people remove all agency from women, telling them that they are helpless without feminism and that they can't be free to express their sexuality (in most cases referring to heterosexuality) without indirectly harming others. They believe that all their own problems stem from society and they have zero self awareness. It is possible that Anti GG's and third parties have posed as gg'ers to stir shit, and there are bad apples among the gg'ers that may have done the same, nobody knows. But GG's mission is to end the sexist, bigotted, and perverse overcompensation for historical discrimination that society has already deemed despicable and was moving away from that is perpetuated by SJW types. The racism towards white people that gets ignored because somehow somewhere it was decided that institutional racism = racism and that apparently there never was a society that enslaved white people (ignoring thousands of years of history, for example the Khan dynasty, germanic peoples, Moors, Celts, Greeks, fuck just about everyone has been enslaved or enslaved someone else). It also claims that preferences tacitly belie discrimantion no matter what (even if sometimes it may be that way you can't really prove that and it does not cause significant harm) and that any figure couldn't possible be criticized for any reason besides racism/phobia/sexism. The struggles of victims are stolen for the sake of pointing out how evil society is. Their irrational claims draws negative attention and encourages those that had some small amount of sexism/homophobia/etc. to justify it ("oh that crazy femnazi dyke bitch trying to tell me what to do lol" or any other sort of reaction it might cause). I personally know teens my age that will say sexist shit just to rile up our local hoard of self loathing teenage girls and people think it is hilarious. This bullshit makes a mockery of all feminism/rights movements and prevents focus on actual issues. Doxxing and harassing those who defy you're narrative is a despicable course of action. And if you think my rebuttal is harassment, you're a fucking joke and lack emotional maturity. Hurt feelings are not grounds for outcry. I will not stand for perverted identity politics that will make a world where Frozen is racist, gay men are sexist, sex is rape, any feeling of regret is rape, sex involving two intoxicated members of opposite sex puts that man in prison, women who rape are celebrated or go unpunished, living unhealthy is praised, and where criticism is tantamount to violence. I do not want draconian censorship of humor and insults that are even remotely offensive, that would be a rather joyless world. 1984 was a warning but social justice hypocrites treat it like a manual for running the world.
Edit: to the people who downvoted, does that really make me wrong? that you disagree? That the number is proof? Care to defend yourselves? No? That's right, because almost everything you got is illogical or a conclusion drawn from bias without being well informed.

https://np.reddit.com/r/ainbow/comments/3dl2hg/gawker_aids_in_the_blackmailing_and_outing_of_a/ct6azle

Extra nugget: 

They criticizing a movement that wants to eliminate disagreement and dissent that doesn't adhere to their beliefs. Orwell specifically decried this. I don't know how you have so massively misunderstood his views on societal structure. He is against oppressive practices that he clearly defined. Reactionary is a poor choice to describe GG. I could say all SJW's are reactionary, they see something they decide is not right and let everyone know. Face it, we're both mud rakers here. Fuck stains doesn't leave me with any constructive feedback so I'll move on. The sjw movement absolutely has elements of 1984, doublethink, careful scrutiny of all media for ideas that don't conform, and the desire for indoctrination.

One last one:

Proving my point, how does this prove in any way shape or form that I am a man baby? What even is a man baby? Someone who wears a diaper on Tuesday nights? Someone who is 27 and watches adventure time while high? Someone who whines a lot ("there are not enough hours in the day")? Ignorant how? Do you claim to have a fair and unbiased viewpoint of both sides? I personally know LGBT people have a shit time, T and B especially (I don't we should place value on how bad certain individuals have it, more of the whole whining about life deal) but we are gradually getting better and the best thing for that is positivity, not negativity and captious behavior. I am not gonna sit and let people tell me that we are getting worse or that there is nothing we can do except point out flaws.

It's a gift that keeps on giving:

Is politics being in games necessary? It happens in other mediums sure, but not nearly to the degree that you would like for games. Why are violent games a problem? The install base of violent video games compared to those who have committed violence in the name of games is monstrous. They aren't even comparable.

Our society for milennia has been extremely sex negative, and even your side will decry "slut shamers" Sexuality is a part of who we are and lots of innocuous things can and have been sexualized. Do you think the new Miguel album is grossly sexualized? He writes about his heterosexuality in an overt way that's at times self loathing, indulgent, and identifies his desires. I wouldn't expect someone who doesn't analyze music to immediately get it. Wildheart is a fantastic album, critically acclaimed and everything. Why focus overtly on video games/tv/movies? Mad Max wasn't a political statement, it was just good writing. You are confusing politics with being socially conscious. Content creators are free to express political beliefs but their content must also be more than a platform for their beliefs. Sunset comes to mind, it wasn't a game, but I will give the premise credit. It could have been a short film, which could have been well received but it tried to be a game for "real gamers" that lacked gameplay. 




 So he made a community about people being "bigots" toward racists and those people are the *real* bigots?

 KING JAMES HAS ARRIVED. 




 He seems more like a wet noodle.  




 I'm waiting for Yishan to infiltrate Reddit from the inside once again. Yishan gets hired as a "consultant" and three months down will frame Steve Huffman by putting nude photos of dogs having sex with plushie dolls and then take over the CEO position and nuke this site from the sky while Back in the Saddle plays.

I don't think Steve Huffman is as strong a leader to get Reddit monetized and bring in users. And he's too much of a wet noodle to decide on what to ban. Even his purge picks were like, "Yeah, okay. This one is obvious, but this one will be over there, I gueeeess." 




 The URL is hilarious by the way.

**chuck-johnson-is-a-massive-baby-who-doesnt-know-how-to-read-service-agreements** 




 Stenley kubrcik died for our memes. 




 Limn is trying to stile our creation of memes. its in the constitution that we have freedom of memes. 




 I was briefly subbed to /r/MadMaxGem. Made a post, some comments, etc. And unsubbed within a week. The MoviesCirclejerk guys were choking out any discussion. They commented on nearly everything people said to mock and demean. **It seemed to be only two or three** really dedicated trolls, but christ, what a shitshow. 




 Dredd wasn't even on the list. What the fuck is this amateur hour?  




 I recently graduated and wrote my thesis paper on cult films. My actual paper, however, wasn't up to my personal par because I was typing it in a drugged stupor from a hospital bed in order to graduate on time, so I figured I'd try and not waste months of research and put my knowledge to good use! Let me know if you like this, because I have 8000 more things to say (ex: the history of cult, what defines "cult status", cult vs. cool, the new rules of cult in the internet age, **why I hate Quentin Tarantino,** etc.), or I could talk about specific films, too.

EDGY 









 I hope we get to see that guys surgically larger dick or this money will have been for nothing.  




 Apparently, mocking individuals is only reserved for bon vivants of the highest caliber over at Kotaku in Action. No one can understand the deep wells of meaning behind their famed sense of dignity. 




 You posted a Deadline article saying that this is empirical evidence that he's doing something akin to throwing out the first draft.

Jon Spaihts is writing Doctor Strange.

That's your statement saying he's writing it, not "re-writing" it. Either way, I don't know what the fuck we're talking about. Three guys have put in work on the screenplay and that's that.  




  The first draft of the Doctor Strange script was penned by Thomas Dean Donnelly and Joshua Oppenheimer.

Exactly, he's rewriting it. This isn't proof that he's throwing out the entire first draft.  




 We don't actually know what he's doing or whether he'll be keeping material from Donelly and Oppenheimer. You really can't empirically say that you know he'll be throwing away their entire work.  




 Not by much. A lot of his scenes were left in. The major changes by Lindelof and Scott were done by the studio; No Xenomorphs, the pod sequence was changed, the ending was a little more open, and the love making sequence doesn't end with a xenomorph popping out. 

The only change I think would have made the film better was if David did follow through with believing he was an heir to the engineers and not having the black goo sequence. Other than that, his delusions are a little unexplained. The scene that was removed about Shaw and David with the facehugger had the potential to be extremely corny.  




 So are Thomas Dean Donelly and Joshua Oppenheimer. 




  Jon Spaihts

You're gonna have a hard time convincing me that the same writers as Dylan Dog: Dead of Night and Conan the Barbarian (Remake) and the writer of The Darkest Hour and one half of the team that wrote Prometheus is not some sort of unholy alliance made in hell.  




 r u a bettr fathr now? 




 [Here's the interview](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/02/movies/anthony-and-joe-russo-on-captain-america-winter-soldier.html?_r=0)

They were a bit shocked he went there. 




 Can't wait for another movie about Rosemary Dewitt doing Rosemary Dewitt things.  




 James Vanderbilt also wrote the fantastic satire cum 80's wet dream action movie White House Down.  




 "Spider Man...listen right cause he's the great part...tries to kill his boss at the Daily Bugle, but he doesn't know how...stop me if you've heard this one *big grin* okaydon'tstopmeifyou'veheardthisone...but then he's friends with Harry Osborne who ALSO works at the Daily Bugle. And together they try to kill their boss in wacky ways. Wahoo how'd ya like it!?"

"Get out of here, Mr. Trump." 




 My favorite question lobbed at the Russo brothers was during the press tour for The Winter Solider and Brooks Barnes straight up said, "Why should we forgive you for You, Me and Dupree?" 




 The same writers as Dylan Dog: Dead of Night and Conan the Barbarian (Remake) are writing Doctor Strange. Basically Marvel struck out twice. 

John Sayles apparently is a great writer because his ideas survived long enough to get into Jurassic World. Get him.  




 All of those movies. Instant classics. They belong in the Criterion Collection. Each one. 




 Except for Batman V Superman. Then it's okay. And Suicide Squad. I'm willing to be advertised to about suicide Squad. And Doctor Strange I want Doctor Strange ads all over my body. 




  Somewhat off-topic, but where does the idea that Girls is somehow an accurate portrayal of the millennial generation come from?

Because Lena Dunham proclaimed on the first episode that she's a "voice of a generation" and everyone just went with it. It speaks to some sub section of "millennials" who find that self destructive attitude much like their own. 




 At least it was better written than the potential Donald Trump memoir: "I'm better than you. You know it and you're a dummy. Look at my Billions. TEN BILLION DOLLARS" 




 I don't understand his complaint either.

"Oh, yoooooooou hippies. If you're gonna come here then just stand at the city limits and proclaim your guilt before entering this dead city. You should feel bad from taking it away from honest people."

From all the news out of Detroit, it sounds like the honest people either died, were killed, or up and left. Why the fuck does anyone need to answer to that guy? Living in a city isn't a badge of honor. He's not Joseph Mitchell, patron saint of the working class, either.

But this line was priceless:

Thats the rub. Thats what gets me, because weve lived here in Detroit all this time and we know how to get along here.

Not long enough to save that city from bankruptcy apparently.  




 I'm fucking loving this Highline shit they got there. The Huffington Post is an un-navigable mess. It's nice they just decided to clean it up and put all the good shit somewhere else.  
























 Uhhh..the headline on NY Times front page was the shooters life was ["Short and Bitter."](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/17/us/chattanooga-shooting-suspect-was-ordinary-boy-neighbors-recall.html?hp action=click pgtype=Homepage module=b-lede-package-region region=top-news WT.nav=top-news) 




 So this is the excuse for bad costume design?  




 Rights to license the music probably cost them the rest.  




 Reddit MD is on the case. lol. It's just like how Cringe always tries to diagnose that one kid from the Minecon 2013 video as autistic. 




 "So that's it, huh? We're just some kind of Guardians of the Galaxy tribute band." - Will Smith 




 Yishan: The internet's greatest hype man.  




 I've seen pictures of the look they're going for, but honestly I wish some costume designer went, "Are we really going to build an action movie around sexy vampire costumes?"

The Days of Future Past tactical costumes were much better. The thing here is that it just doesn't make Psylocke look very intimidating.  




 This was on /r/videos. Someone probably thought this would make it in this sub. Ya'll are upvoting it.  




 No, he's not my Jonas. He's Joe Jonas. 




 Isn't this indicative of all the X-Men movies starting with First Class? They have the production values of a TV show along side giant CGI million dollar spectacle. I'm not even buying Olivia Munn's costume. It just looks like "Sexy Vampire" from a Halloween outlet.  




 He is. Right now he's the only credited writer on the project.  




 Resurrection was fun. Also, Ron Perlman. 




 It used to get play all the time on Cartoon Network. Then CN became the network of adult stoners and they moved all the Chuck Jones-Hannah Barbera stuff to Boomerang. 




 What about all them trigger warnings for spider posts?

 America went to war in Iraq because their games journalism ethics was unethical. It was right there behind GWB when he said mission accomplished.  




 KiA mods literally post a XCDC image post re-edited about changing ones argument to fit their views and then here it is happening. A degree of self-awareness would go a long way for those people. 




 Steve Huffman is a wet noodle confirmed.  




 Everyone died for this.  




 Never forget the black guy on a scooter in Wal-Mart video. /r/videos was just piling on with stormfront shit. 




 /u/spez by making an AMA is currently proving the AskHistorian mods right one wall of text at a time in that announcement thread.  




 It might trigger him. 




 In such short time as well. I wonder if they'll start to copyright their angry rants and demand royalties.

 TunicSong laying the fucking smackdown. beautiful. 




 Apparently it's a-okay to Steve Huffman as long as you tell the biwg bawd meanie weenies that their sub is a weally bad place to go. That wasn't going to stop them from seeding and colonizing other areas of the site. Huffman done fucked up big time. 




 YISHAN PROMISED HEADS WILL ROLL. I WAS TOLD HEADS WILL ROLL! 




 [Coontown is rejoicing](http://gawker.com/reddits-most-racist-community-rejoices-as-new-ceo-says-1718353537) 




 Wow, does that guy have proof or did he shit that one out because he knows the inner workings of the upvote system? 




 Reading the "reclassified" terms was a pussy move. God, such a fucking disappointment. And the media is gonna kick him in the tits about it till he breaks too.   




 People are really desperate to keep ShitRedditSyas and really desperate to keep Coontown. I'm waiting for Yishan to go fucking ham in the thread. 




 It's copy pasta. It was on Best of Outrage Culture. He's looking for gold. 




 [The SRS question has been asked. It's fucking long.](https://np.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3djjxw/lets_talk_content_ama/ct5qubn)

Apparently, even SRS can't escape reclassification. IT MUST BE BANNED!!!! 




 I'm seeing a lot of Conservatives and Republicans fearing for their lives. I think people here either don't know how to read English or don't understand that shitty subs are shitty subs. Either way. CT not getting the boot is fuckinf shitty. 




 Rapingwomen is done for. 




 Same shit happens in Anime.  




 It looks like a costume from Star Trek: TNG 




 I hope the first guy gets as many questions as Lloyd Kaufman.  




 I NEED A HERO! 




 Looks like that prison could have used an El Chaporone.  




 They're a Redditor. You're a Redditor. I'm a Redditor. No where did I say he's wrong in calling out the hypocrisy. I would like for you to point out where I said, "He is wrong you can exclude opinions based on the color of skin."

I just think that it's funny that when given an opportunity to hear from the conservative element of Reddit, they do the same thing based on gender and no one calls them out.   




 Proof that sometimes people send nasty PMs during a brigade? I have plenty, but none from Circlebroke. As far as I know, they've never brigaded me. I have plenty from SRD, SRS, and other circlejerk subs. Shit, I was even brigaded by /r/videos[1] once.

He said it, but then provided no proof? Am I going crazy? Has Reddit gone from "we're all science savants" to "I have proof which I cannot show at this time for it is privileged information." 




 I didn't say it was. I just think it's a weird double standard. 




 That score by Edward Shearmur is a 100 percent classic in my book. Perfect. It's a shame these guys didn't get a chance to work again. 




 A fake, made up thing Fox news once got upset about because a young adult author wrote about a bunch of teen girls giving guys blowjobs with different color lipsticks. Hence, rainbow. Roy G. Biv was a lucky guy. 




 19 sucked. I was poor, lonely and had a shit flip phone. Some of these dudes around here seem like they want to go back as they are now because they think they'll be the coolest shit on campus. 




 I sold blowjobs in high school, so I take pride in knowing it's me :)
That's a prostitute. A slut would do it for free.

I enjoy that it rhymed.  




 I hope this is satire, but I've been in True Reddit for a while. They have a large contingent of gamergater, "I don't read articles," "just talking common sense" Bill Burr types. So they know their audience. 

you do realize what you are saying right? You are dismissing someone's opinion based on (your own perceived idea) of what their skin color is. It's baffling to me that you seem to be literally unable of hearing someone's opinion, solely because of the color of their skin.

It's maybe baffling, but then again I read r/videos comments [where they do shit like this](https://np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/3dcedn/some_local_kids_in_my_town_recently_shot_and/ct44gcd). It's not like Redditors don't do it if they hear one of those infamous buzzwords.  




 Dear suckerberg,

Penis

Love,
Pepe  




 Who wants to bet a repost of the futurama math formula for time travel repost is not far behind? 




 And the VHS Rewinder. 




 It's a weird story, but probably because everyone would think it's promoting some form of entertainment imperialism and colonialism.  




 They let Floyd Mayweather handle the AMA today. He brought May showers of grammatical errors.  




 Reddit didn't decide to attempt to pretend like they run a company before. 




 After 10 years, Alexis and Huffman realize that people who pay money expect the guys running a company to work for a living. 




 Like Karmanaut need the ego boost to tell people on a first date, "You know guys. I brought down Reddit." 




 She looks like Zooey Deschanel. Like it's reeeeeally close match. 




 Most of this video is comprised of exactly the kind of hipster girls I expected to see.  




 He's not my Jonas. Maybe he's someone elses Jonas. 




 Either those comments are real or Marvel has a very dedicated group of PR professionals.  




  What? No it wasn't and no they didn't. The first Transformers movie is literally the only movie I've ever walked out of. 

Congratulations on this anecdotal evidence. Roger Ebert gave it [3 out of 4 stars](http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/transformers-2007). But please, rant on.

You know what? I'm just going to tell myself that you're being sarcastic so I can get some sleep tonight.

Do you always lose sleep over movies other people like?

 I think the first Transformers has a better chance than the other three. Transformers 1 was a legit good movie. Even the critics were shocked Michael Bay had pulled off Steve Spielberg's a boy and his dog story so well. 




 There are no content creators on Voat. The Voaters are starting to realize that the great content creators and karmawhores are the people that run reddit. It's why you can wake up every day and find up to date information. /v/movies has shit from 7 days ago sitting on page 2. There's nothing there but shit posters, the bigots and unfunny assholes that think "DAE Reddit" is a funny joak.

The worst part is the Free Speech clowns keep using this faulty slippery slope argument. Slippery slopes are supposed to end in something bad for it to be a viable argument. Coontown is not going to get any sympathy from any one if it disappears tomorrow. And Anime and their waifus won't be on the chopping block.

 Here's the thing. You said a "Wikipedia editor is a Unidan."
Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.
As someone who is a scientist who studies Unidans, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls Wikipedia editors Unidans. If you want to be "specific" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.
If you're saying "Unidan family" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Unidae, which includes things from biologists to bloggers to nature journalists.
So your reasoning for calling a Wikipedia editor a Unidan is because random people "call the stuck-up ones Unidans?" Let's get MRAs and neckbeards in there, then, too.
Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A Wikipedia editor is a Wikipedia editor and a member of the Unidan family. But that's not what you said. You said a Wikipedia editor is a Unidan, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the Unidan family Unidans, which means you'd call teachers, researchers, and other reddit celebrities Unidans, too. Which you said you don't.
It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?

 Here's the thing. You said ".999... is equivalent to 1."
Is it the same value? Yes. No one's arguing that.
As someone who is an expert mathotologist who studies numbers, I am telling you, specifically, in mathematics, no one says .999... is equivalent to 1. If you want to be "specific" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.
If you're saying "1" you're referring to the multiplicative identity value of the field that defines real numbers, which includes things from rational numbers to irrational numbers to pi.
So your reasoning for equalizing .999... to 1 is because random people "say they're the same value"? Let's get 1.000.... and -ei*pi in there, then, too.
Also, calling two numbers equivalent or not? It's not one or the other, that's not how mathematics works. They're both. .999 is equivalent to .999 which has the same value as 1. But that's not what you said. You said .999 is equivalent to 1, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all infinite sequences for which the limit is 1 as 1, which means you'd say 1.000... is equal to 1, too.

 That's why I used the albacore/tuna analogy. What we call "tuna" are many species in the Thunnis genus or, perhaps more broadly, the Thunnini tribe. What we call a species and what it's taxonomical name is are two different things.
Put another way, either all Corvus species are crows or none of them are, depending on which nomenclature you're using. It's an entirely semantic argument. The jackdaw is corvus monedula while the New Caledonian crow is corvus moneduloides. Of course, our names for those species are "jackdaw" and "crow." However, like how "tuna" refers to all species in the genus Thunnus or the tribe Thunnini, there are also species called XXX tuna and species without tuna in the name. It doesn't make them not tuna, it just means that the common name for them doesn't include the word tuna.
"Cat" refers to any feline in the felis genus, specifically. You've got your domesticated variety which are called, I shit you not, felis catus, but you've also got jungle cats, sand cats, wild cats, etc. Also, "cat" appears in other genera with "cat" in the name as well as Felidae being literally referred to as the "cat family." "People in science" would definitely refer to a group containing tigers and lions as "large cats."
So, in sum, in the common language, all felidae are cats, all thunnini are tuna, and all corvus are crows. The jackdaw, in particular, is much more like a crow than most ravens. It's really the only odd one out, because there's only two species, one named after the other, which was named arbitrarily (I just looked it up, in either middle or old English, jack meant "small" and daw meant "bird"). Turns out the jackdaw is a type of crow. It seems like some people want to put it into it's own genus, which might still be problematic because I've heard people refer to Corvidae, as a family as crows, also. I wouldn't call a blue jay a crow, but I'd call jackdaws crows. Fuck jackdaws.

 I will just preface this by saying I am in fact 17 years old, I am white, and I do live in America. Do I think my problems are worse than that of the people in Ethiopia? Yes, yes I do. I can explain to you in detail.
I am being spied on constantly. They watch what I do, they read my emails, and they probably snicker at the things I watch, and you act like you know oppression? Those Ethiopians get hurt, sure, but the time is going to come when the US government will arrest me simply for not agreeing with them. Where men and women will not have their say any where. And for now, we have to pay a tax for people who live off welfare (lazy bastards) who won't do anything with it and will only buy drugs and beer, even Kafka would find this shit unbelievable.

 This one time I was in traffic in new yogurt where obviously the hottest mladies reside. So I really had to get to this important event (neckbeard furry convention, don't judge me it's a primal instinct) and the cats wouldn't move. Sweat pearls were forming under my hillbilly because I knew my fellow neckbeard brothers were waiting for me to give an epic speech about furries. But most importantly my waifu was waiting for me. So I honked a few times and this douchdoge came out of his Ferrarighini pasta tortellini in front of me and told me to fite rite here rite now. So I got out of the car and threw my two ninja katana stars in his eyes. Upon him falling to the ground, I took a big sip out my mtn dew bottle and shoved a couple of le doritos down my throat. After that I cruised away in the douchbages Ferrari and on my way to the furry convention the douchbage's two hot girlfriends gave me BJs and that's how I lost my virginity.

 I've been on this supp called "Muscle Death" that reinhibits your muscletrophin or some shit and it says to stop after 2 days because it's so hardcore. Took it for a year, pretty sure I've been dead for months now but it's cool because I'm big at the discoteque I feel big I feel important I feel effective like I could move people around if I wanted like chess pieces, like if this girl grinds on me I could move her with my arms like I have control of my environment you know what I'm saying? Like if my dick went limp I'd just flex my tris and there'd be no.... shame. Like I'd rather die than not feel effective. I'd rather die on this fucking magic powder than feel like a grain of sand on the fucking beach like life doesn't welcome me, like the vital girls in this room don't think I could move them without making a face. They want... No they need someone to move them. They need it. They are looking around that discoteque for someone that can move them. This powder says it can give me the stature to be that guy. I'd rather die on this powder than be the guy that can't move a girl, can't move anybody. I'm just a spectator unless I take this powder and the more the better. It says take one scoop I take 8. Let's move shit. Life is a joke nobody wants to be the punchline though. I take this powder and ignore my social life for a couple of years so I can be something solid, something with mass, something that can move. Something effective and affective. Walk up in a room and be like damn that guy didn't talk to anyone for years and now he looks like he can move anyone here. What the fuck happened to that guy? He apparently lifted and shunned the world for 2 years so he could become effective. If he felt effective he could feel as if something matters on this grey ass planet of meaninglessness, he could move people. It worked though, he's big as shit now and seems to be moving people but I heard his dad used to be big as shit too but that he's got heart issues now and shriveled up. Like you build all that effectiveness up just to watch it waste away. Like life is just a study of regression. We build castles of sand to watch them wash away and being effective ain't even important. We build our own towers of Babel and they just crash down and it's almost worse to have to witness the crash than to never be high to begin with. I hear he hates himself, and his dad for exemplifing his greatest fear, that what he felt was important wasn't at all. The powder is false. Everybody is false. I hear he's effective now but he sees his father in himself and knows one day he too will shrivel up. That this makes him sad and he can't even enjoy his effectiveness anymore. All that work for nothing. All that work for nothing. All that work for nothing. All that work for nothing. All that work for nothing. Fuck, it's like we don't even realize our own death. We conceptualize as something that it's not, like it's so far away that I can't be bothered with it now. Like you have to be a bleeding heart to even actualize it, nobody does. Like oh here is this so edgy guy playing the part of the guy that thinks he's being deep by talking about death... he's so typical. I'm so clever because I can recognize the guy trying to be clever, and point it out, which rectifies my own delusion of being clever and immortal and above all of this. I better reply to this to reflect back into myself how above these thoughts I am, and if I get some upvotes I'll be even more validated of my own immortality and meaning. I'm not done. How can he hate is father? Well he was his father's son, grew up believing that what his father pointed out as meaningful would truly be meaningful. But as his father grew old his son realized that the direction he had been led towards was false, he couldn't figure anything out. It's all a spiral after that, the fathers realization of meaninglessness reflecting into the very eyes of his own creation. It's a tragedy and not even that matters. The old man had given his son the one thing that should never be passed down, the clarity of sickness the clarity of ill health the clarity of nothingness and voidness and ineffectiveness. That all people are impotent. That all people are sterile. Life is impotent. The nurses cleaning up the bed pans couldn't give you the answer. Hell the surgeons operating on his heart to the best of techno music surely couldn't give you the answer. Nobody's got it. Everybody's just doing the motions that solve their cost function. We've all got one you know, a cost function. A measure of importance imparted on every neuron that determines their specific weights in the influence on the grand network, our brains. These cost functions are usually shaped by genetics, environment, and influence. When these cost functions are determined to be false what is a person to do? He's left to sit in prolonged apathy towards every one and every thing, some call it depression. "Keep your head up, join a gym, meet a girl at the discoteque ", they say. Hilarious. They haven't invalidated their cost function yet, what do they know but what delusions they reside in. Alright that's it, the acetate is wearing off - Hitchens knows, I've seen it happen

Realistically the Circlejerk Meme Force would be far more effective than half the world's militaries. The Afghan military is fucked up on opium. The Iraqi army cant even do jumping jacks. Plus New Zealand has only 8 thousand military personnel the majority of whom are unenlightened skrubs. 

I don't actually support the violent overthrow of New Zealand. I just think its kind of a dank meme conceptually.

 I'm 15 but I'll chime in. A lot of us are actually very smart and aware of the world around us. A lot of us respect each other and adults. We aren't all squealing uncontrollable little kids (there's a minority of those though that you all seem to complain about all the time and not acknowledge that there are actually some of us out here more mature than the majority of older teens and some adults). Some of us choose to give our demographic a bad reputation with the Internet, while others use the Internet to gain knowledge and wisdom.

 I've been to more countries than you have had sexual partners. I've killed more people than you've even had real altercations with. I don't need to play passive aggressive bitch and "win" with you. You're a pussy and you have no idea what or who I am. The fact that you're a fucking idiot on top of thinking you have me pegged is funny. Oh and you're little joke about my brevity, grammar, etc is funny. What is your education? I'm about to go to medical school to be a neurologist.

 [this isnt like a rant about how my parents and other people tell me ill change my mind when im older or some spawns being dicks and have the energy to annoy you all day]
Im visiting some relatives right now, and my cousin is in the picture somewhere, shes 5 y/o.
Anyway when I arrive I start to unpack, I also have some snacks in my bag that I brought for me and only me.
I leave my room and go to the living room to talk with everyone else, meanwhile she just cant stay in one place and basically walks everywhere around the house. Eventually she ends up in my room and takes out some kit kat from my stuff. Her mom finds her in my room, with her fingers and chin covered in my chocolate and comes to tell all of us how cute it is.. Wtf. No.
Later, Im browsing reddit on my phone and she sees me holding my phone and just tells me "Give me your phone, I want to play games". After I refuse she is obviously pissed and tells her parents and her brother, and they actually agreed that I should give her my phone so she can play games.
Although that doesnt surprise me cause my family kind of always lacked money and some logic, but these relatives, they are in a TON of bank loan, and were in the same situation when they decided to have another spawn. I really dont understand the "more kids more happiness" logic.
Also sorry for my english as its not my native language and for my formatting, submitting this from phone.

 I hole-hardedly agree, but allow me to play doubles advocate here for a moment. For all intensive purposes I think you are wrong. In an age where false morals are a diamond dozen, true virtues are a blessing in the skies. We often put our false morality on a petal stool like a bunch of pre-Madonnas, but you all seem to be taking something very valuable for granite. So I ask of you to mustard up all the strength you can because it is a doggy dog world out there. Although there is some merit to what you are saying it seems like you have a huge ship on your shoulder. In your argument you seem to throw everything in but the kids Nsync, and even though you are having a feel day with this I am here to bring you back into reality. I have a sick sense when it comes to these types of things. It is almost spooky, because I cannot turn a blonde eye to these glaring flaws in your rhetoric. I have zero taller ants when it comes to people spouting out hate in the name of moral righteousness. You just need to remember what comes around is all around, and when supply and command fails you will be the first to go. Make my words, when you get down to brass stacks it doesn't take rocket appliances to get two birds stoned at once. It's clear who makes the pants in this relationship, and sometimes you just have to swallow your prize and accept the facts. You might have to come to this conclusion through denial and error but I swear on my mother's mating name that when you put the petal to the medal you will pass with flying carpets like its a peach of cake.

 I'm kinda ashamed to admit this, but I don't make a lot of money. I work thirty-two hours a week as a cashier for a local fast-food restaurant and barely have enough to pay my part of the rent and utilities. I live in a two bedroom apartment with four other people. There is a walk-in storage closet in the kitchen that was just big enough for a twin bed and a night stand. It isn't much, but it is home. On the plus side, I don't have to go far to get a midnight snack. On the downside I have to walk across the apartment to use the bathroom. 

Being a member of the working-poor and living in a closet doesn't exactly translate into adoration from the opposite sex. I have below-average social skills and I'm not what anyone would describe as handsome. I'm the kind of guy who would have to pay for sex, but as I mentioned, I can barely pay rent. After two hundred bucks for a closet and my part of the utilities, which is usually just as much, I have a little over a hundred bucks a month to spend on food and personal items. 

As one could imagine, I spend most of my downtime locked in my room using a cheap Android tablet to browse the internet in an attempt to find something to occupy my mind in the hours between sleep and slaving away at Burger Hell. Like most men with no social life and zero chance of finding a consenting adult to touch their genitals, this includes a fair amount of porn consumption. 

For the past few years I have wanted a Fleshlight. For those who aren't inundated with ads every time they load up a page showing a redheaded schoolgirl taking oral instruction from a well hung instructor; a Fleshlight is a soft penile masturbation sleeve held within a rigid case that resembles a flashlight. The mouth of the device slides over the, well you know. For lonely guys it is the closest we come to experiencing sex. I've always wanted one, but I cannot afford to spend $58.95 for the base model. 

I was browsing through used sex toys on Ebay when something caught my eye. The headline read:

Slightly used homemade Fleshlight. Has been cleaned. Must go.

The buy it now price was listed at five dollars and it had free shipping. Excited, I put in my paypal information and waited for the masturbatory device to arrive in the mail from Bob's Taxidermy. Three days later I was excited to receive a small package in the mail. I spirited it away to my closet and opened it to some disappointment. The vacuum sealed package was that of a normal plastic Rayovac flashlight. I pulled off the bulb to see what appeared to be a leather facsimile of a vagina. The pamphlet that came with the device read, Use Enclosed oil on exterior and inner lining after washing with warm soapy water after each use.

Later that night I tried it out. The texture was a little off, but it actually felt halfway similar to the real thing. Content with my purchase, I put it in the drawer of my nightstand. It might sound strange, but this tiny little adjustment to my life improved my confidence. I performed better at work. I was more comfortable talking to girls. As strange as it may sound, I started to fall in love with this five dollar used sexy toy I'd found on ebay. 

One night after a particularly furious self-pleasuring, I fell asleep with the Fleshlight still attached if you know what I mean. That night I was treated to violent dreams of a sweaty old man grabbing me by the throat and choking the life out of me. I woke from this dream to the sensation of the Fleshlight moving back and forth. For a brief moment I thought a saw a grandmotherly woman riding on top of me. I wiped the sleep from my eyes and pulled the Fleshlight off. After a thorough cleaning I put it back in the drawer.

It was an odd night, but I'd had weirder dreams. I chalked it up to the Chantix I'd started the day before and a significant decrease in my smoking habit. I went to work as scheduled and returned home to see my roommates standing around the television. A man in New Hampshire had been arrested by the FBI for murdering his wife and using his skills as a taxidermist to hide the body in various homemade objects which he sold online. I shuddered at the thought and returned to my closet. I pulled up the news story on my tablet and opened a new tab to enjoy my Fleshlight to the stylings of a lonely housewife being serviced by a plumber with an uncharacteristically ripped physique. 

I was about halfway through my session when there was a knock on my door. I covered myself with a blanket and said, Come in.

It was my roommate Jamie. He stood in the doorway and said, 

Hey, that package you got last week. The box was in the trash. What did you order?

I panicked and said, Oh nothing, just a stuffed lizard I gave a guy at work.

Jamie grimaced and said, You might wanna call him. The box was from Bob's Taxidermy, that lizard is made from that crazy guy's wife. He choked her to death and cut her into a bunch of pieces he sold online. The cops are tracking down all the people who bought his items. They'll probably be here any day now.

Jamie closed the door and I looked at the slight bulge in my blanket caused by the Fleshlight attached to my then flaccid member. I read the article and sure enough, Miriam Johansen had been murdered and shipped all over the country. I thought about the dream and the resulting straddling I felt after. Mortified, I pulled the thing off of me and cleaned it thoroughly. I was too scared to throw it away and freaked out by its presence. I'd been masturbating with a vagina cut from a murdered woman and fashioned into a forever alone fuck sleeve. My panic intensified. 

Ultimately, I put the macabre toy in an old shoebox and slid it under my bed. What sleep I got that night was fitful at best. I dreamt of Bob the Taxidermist choking me to death and cutting me into pieces he sold online. I woke in a cold sweat to the same grandmotherly woman sitting on the foot of my bed. She looked sad, but at the same time there was a warm feeling about her. I sat up in my bed, and wiped the sleep from my eyes as she faded into the darkness. I heard a low scraping sound on the floor and looked down to see that the shoebox had slid out from under my bed. 

I became overwhelmed by the urge to use it one last time. I pulled it out and slid it onto myself as I reached for my tablet. The tablet wouldn't turn on so I tried to think of something that would turn me on. A few strokes into the experience I felt the hand holding the Fleshlight being pulled away. Soon the other hand was lifted as well. They were pinned behind my head. Soon after I felt a tight grip on my throat. As it became harder to breathe, the grandmotherly woman became visible again. I could feel the Fleshlight moving faster and grinding further down as her expression turned to one of sheer hatred. The last thing I remember is the most intense climax of my life as I passed out from lack of oxygen. 

The next morning I was greeted by two FBI agents who found me laying naked in bed with the Fleshlight still attached to my member and deep read hand prints across my throat. As I slowly woke up and realized my precarious situation I reached for a blanket to cover myself. The taller of the two agents asked me to place the toy in a large plastic bag he was holding out. I was asked to dress myself and join him at the station. After it was all worked out I wasn't facing any charges. It didn't change the fact that my roommates found out I'd been jacking it with the taxidermied vagina of a murder victim. They in turn told my co-workers who told pretty much everyone else. People would snicker and call me corpse fucker under their breath. 

My roommates informed me that they'd prefer if I found a new place to live. I had until the end of the month to find a new place. It was much the same at work. I had been branded as a necrophile and my manager said that my presence reflected badly on the store. I was too said and too mortified from my experiences that week to even attempt to fap. So, with nothing else to do I turned on my tablet and checked my email. The first line of my inbox read.

(URGENT: PLEASE READ) Settlement information enclosed.

It was from Ebay. 

Contained within was a request for my banking information. As a result of the items made from human flesh being sold through their site, every buyer was being offered a settlement of nearly a hundred thousand dollars. I replied with my checking account and routing number. A couple days later I was rolling in the cash. I paid for a semester of college in cash and got a private dorm room. Sitting at my new desk on a recently purchased laptop I opened my web browser and bought an official Fleshlight. Even with the change in finances, I figured it unlikely I'd have sex anytime soon.

Besides, the only real sex I'd ever had included being hatefucked by a pissed off ghost.

 Let me preface this by saying that I've been a memer since they first appeared on 4chan circa 2006 (ages ago in internet time). I remember refreshing /b/ all afternoon with the hope that someone would make a new meme. I was a memer back when Advice Dog was the only one and I still upvote every Advice Dog meme I see becasue of the fond rush of nostalgia it brings me. Nowadays, there are many thousand on quickmeme and other meme websites. I was a memer back before memegenerator was created (the first meme website) and I had to make them with MS Powerpoint or Paint. Speaking of meme websites, I was one of the first submitters to memebase.com and still have one of the top accounts there despite having migrated to reddit nearly 2 years ago. It was on 4chan and memebase where I cut my teeth creating memes, way before I had a reddit account and way before /r/adviceanimals[1] was created in late 2010. Back before I could get any sort of points or even username recognition, I was creating memes as a clever and easily digestible way to reflect on society, relate some story to my audience, or just be funny. Do you remember rich raven? No? I do. You probably don't remember depression dog, crazy girlfriend praying mantis, introspective pug, or friendzone Johnny either. I remember all of them. In fact, you have only submitted two posts to adviceanimals garnering a total of just 4 points and have not commented there any time recently. So please, respect my judgement regarding the direction of the subreddit and the integrity of posts I have held dear to my heart for nearly 7 years but you have no strong feelings for. Thanks.

 The MCU Fanboy is completely egocentric, trapped inside himself, incapable of empathizing or identifying with others, or love, friendship, affection of tenderness. He is a completely isolated unit, incapable of rapport with anyone. His responses are entirely visceral, not cerebral; his intelligence is a mere tool in the services of his drives and needs; he is incapable of mental passion, mental interaction; he can't relate to anything other than his own physical sensations. He is a half-dead, unresponsive lump, incapable of giving or receiving pleasure or happiness; consequently, he is at best an utter bore, an inoffensive blob, since only those capable of absorption in others can be charming. He is trapped in a twilight zone halfway between humans and apes, and is far worse off than the apes because, unlike the apes, he is capable of a large array of negative feelings -- hate, jealousy, contempt, disgust, guilt, shame, doubt -- and moreover, he is aware of what he is and what he isn't.

Not everything can be Citizen Kane... transformers blah...

When will superhero movies stop being a thing... your stupid... no you are... Shampoo is better. I go on first and clean the hair. Conditioner is better. I leave the hair silky and smooth.

 Here's the thing. You said "Bernie Sanders is a socialist."
Is he in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.
As someone who is a community organizer who studies socialism, I am telling you, specifically, in community organizing, no one calls Bernie Sanders socialist. If you want to be "specific" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.
If you're saying "social democrat" you're referring to the political ideology of reformist socialism, which includes commies from Bernstein to Crosland to Blair.
So your reasoning for calling a Bernie Sanders a socialist is because random people "call liberals socialists?" Let's get Hillary and Warren in there, then, too.
Also, calling someone a democrat or a leftist? It's not one or the other, that's not how progressivism works. They're both. A Bernie Sanders is a Bernie Sanders and a member of the social democrats. But that's not what you said. You said a Bernie Sanders is a socialist, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the social democrats socialists, which means you'd call Croslands, Blairs and other politicians socialists, too. Which you said you don't.
It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?

It was made for the geeks that read every blog post about the whos and whys, looked at all the production stills and followed the negotiations between Marvel and Fox to allow Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch to appear in both films. It was made of the geeks that watch a less-than-stellar show like Marvel Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. simply because it is part of the MCU. It is made for the geeks that actually know what the MCU stands for. It is made for the geeks that are scared they will have their first heart attack before we finally get to see Thanos on screen for any longer than a fleeting cameo (2019 or 2020).

Stand aside 9 year olds, this isnt your movie. It is mine. And I loved it.

 Criticism is criticism, and everyone is entitled to an opinion. The kid didn't like the movie, and he had some fair points. However, if you want to write a review and post it online, you have to reread it, because people will look for every error in your article that they can find. Did you notice that you told us that there are 3 best scenes? "The very first scene is the best scene." "...they fall into a building and their body weight makes it all fall down. That was the best scene. Except the part where all the superheroes try to pick up Thor's hammer but it's too heavy." On another note, to all the idiots who keep saying it's bad parenting to let a 9 year old see a PG-13 movie, shut up. The first time I saw a PG-13 movie, I was six. The line immediately under PG-13 reads "Parents Strongly Cautioned." My parents were strongly cautioned, they watched the movie first, talked about it, and then they decided that they'd let me see it. It was the first Spider-Man movie, and I watched it with my dad. I remembered about 5 of the coolest lines, I remembered some of the coolest fight scenes, and I remember that a couple people died but I didn't remember how. I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE MOVIE! And that was okay for me, because I saw Spider-Man! It was his parents' prerogative to let this particular kid see this particular movie. Stop trying to discredit his opinion by saying he wasn't old enough to see it. I will say that the kid appears to not have been able to grasp most of the plot, but that doesn't mean that his entire opinion is discredited. I'll watch movies from my childhood years later and get a better understanding. Nothing wrong with that. Last thing. Kid, I'm not sure if you actually went to Rotten Tomatoes or not, but don't quote a website if you don't know how it works. The RT score is a ratio of good reviews to total reviews. A single critic can't change that score by more than a point (assuming the film has over 100 reviews, which this one does).

 Y'know, after reading all these Age of Ultron reviews where non-fans complained about how insular, incoherent and confusing the film was, it's starting to seem like the deeper we go into these films the more exclusionary they are going to become to normal fans. 

The inclusion of deep cut Marvel characters like Ulysses Klaw, Ultron, or The Vision just confuses these people. To them these characters seem really undeveloped or shallow, but to fans the characters have already been very, very meticulously developed, so we don't really need all that much exposition to make sense of it. Almost as if the films were made specifically for us.

When the film says "Ultron is going to Wakanda to get vibranium by way of Ulysses Klaw." The normie says to himself, "What? Who? I have no idea what any of those things are or why Ultron is doing that." While the fan says, "Yeah, if Ultron wants to create world peace by wiping out all human life, and vibranium is key to his plan, he may want to hit up Klaw, since he's stolen a shitload of the substance over the years. Makes sense."

Eventually we're going to get to the point where the normies just don't care anymore because they're too confused and don't want to do the homework That's going to result in a drop off in the amount of money these films make. There's still plenty of people out there who will go see these films, and I'm sure that will always justify spending two-hundred million dollars on them, so they're always going to be around, but they're going to become a lot more like actual comics. Impenetrable for people who aren't deeply immersed in this universe. 

You know what I say to that? 

GOOD. 

I don't care if normies are into this shit. I don't really want these characters to be massive, ubiquitous pulp culture phenomenons if that means we have to spend an entire film expositing to people who don't know what's going on. 

These films should be made for the fans. People who aren't hostile to the notion of an extended, interconnected film universe that requires a familiarity with what has come before. Let the normies go back to watching sports, or the Bachelor or whatever the fuck the were into before this stuff came along. 

If they're tired of playing with the toys I've been playing with since I was 6, then I'll take them back. No problem.

 The "real" reason Circlejerk is the bane of Reddit
Been kind of a silent lurker on reddit for years. Recently though, I have been absolutely baffled. There is this reddit cool-kid train where hating on Circlejerk whenever possible is the hip new hip thing. Now I have seen horrible, horrible subs that reddit silently tolerates. Some literally dedicated towards "gassing" Jews... violence, racism, sexism, pedophilia, necrophilia, you name it. But for some reason... Reddit as a whole has decided the worst possible subreddit is the one criticizing first world gluttons with no self control.
The obvious answer is that the average redditor is a fatty, and our message hits close to home (which is true). But I think it goes beyond that. The stereotypical racist/sexist/pervert is very easy to disregard as some obscure toothless creep living in a hovel in a random dark corner of society. But we are just regular people. We are paramedics, firefighters, cops, lawyers, nurses, doctors, teachers, soldiers. We have science, medicine and facts supporting our arguments. They can't just dismiss us as ignorant hicks in some obscure circle, and they hate that.
The numbers don't lie, Circlejerk is growing at a rapid rate. The average person doesn't have to tolerate obese, lazy, entitled people. And they shouldn't. Get used to it reddit fats, because all your whining does is reinforce everything we already knew.

La cosa muy interesante que escribi fue "cuando yo estaba corriendo cosas, si haba algo racista, sexista, homfobo o que me prohibira de inmediato. No creo que hay un lugar para este tipo de cosas en reddit. Por supuesto , ahora que reddit es mucho ms grande, entiendo si tal vez las cosas son diferentes ".
Siempre he recordado que el correo electrnico cuando le la publicacin ocasional aqu donde la gente dice "los fundadores de reddit pretenden que trata de un lugar para la libertad de expresin." Las mentes humanas aman originalismo, por ejemplo, "Estamos en problemas, por lo que seguramente si nos remontamos a las intenciones originales, podemos hacer las cosas de nuevo bien." Lamento decirte chicos, pero no, eso no era su intencin en absoluto nunca. Chupa para ser usted, / r / coontown - Espero que disfruten voat!
La poltica de la libertad de expresin era algo Formalic porque pareca que el curso ms sabio en el momento. Vale la pena que indica que en esa poca, estbamos hablando acerca de si estaba bien para la gente a publicar imgenes espeluznantes de las mujeres tomadas legalmente en pblico. Eso es una mierda, pero es muy lejos de los extremos de odio que algunas partes del anfitrin sitio hoy. Pareca que permiten enredaderas publicar (annima) fotos de mujeres tomadas en pblico, en un tiempo relativamente pequea subreddit que nunca apareci en la primera plana, era un pequeo precio a pagar por lo que es claro que estbamos en un lugar acogedor de todas las opiniones y el discurso.
Despus de haber tomado esa decisin - la mayor parte de la condicin actual de reddit est en m. Yo no preveo lo que (algunos) redditors decidiran que ver con la libertad. reddit se ha convertido en mucho ms grande - s, mucho mejor - Y mucho peor. Tengo que asumir la responsabilidad.
Pero ... la ms deliciosa parte de esto es que al menos en dos ocasiones distintas, la junta presionado / u / ekjp prohibir de plano TODAS las subreddits de odio en una purga de barrido. Ella se resisti, a sabiendas de la comunidad, alegando que sera una shitshow. Ellen no es un "mal, manipuladora, fuera de contacto incompetente diablesa" como se representa a menudo. Ella fue aprobado por la junta directiva y recomendado por m, porque cuando me fui, ella era la nica ejecutivo de tecnologa en cualquier lugar al que tena las chuletas y la experiencia para gestionar una nueva empresa de este tamao, y que entenda lo reddit trataba. Como podemos ver en su actividad despus de la renuncia, que sabe perfectamente cmo encaja con la comunidad reddit y es una persona normal, divertido - al igual que en la vida real - ella simplemente no le cay en reddit todo el da porque era ocupada con su trabajo del da.
Ellen era ms o menos inclinados a continuar la defensa de mis polticas de libertad de expresin. / R / fatpeoplehate fue prohibido por incitar fuera de las instalaciones de acoso, no discutir grasa vergenza. Lo que todos los blancos potencia neckbeards racista sexistas no entienden es que con ella al frente de la compaa, la empresa sera inmune a las acusaciones de promover el sexismo y el racismo: es, literalmente, # 1 feminista hroe de Silicon Valley, por lo que cualquier "SJWs" tendra dificultades para atacar a la empresa para crear intencionalmente un bastin (je) de contenido sexista / racista. Probablemente habra tolerado su existencia, siempre y cuando usted no caus ningn problema - S que sus estrategias a largo plazo deban encontrar la manera de surgir y dar a conocer las buenas partes de reddit - que permite que existan las partes malas, pero mantenindolos fuera de la centro de atencin. Hubiera sido muy de principios - el director general de reddit, que una vez demand a su empleador anterior para la discriminacin sexual, defiende la libertad de expresin y tolera el lado feo de la humanidad, porque es muy importante para mantener una plataforma para el discurso libre. Hubiera sido inexpugnable.
Bueno, ahora se ha ido (lo hiciste Reddit!), Y / u / spez tiene la autoridad moral como un co-fundador de seguir adelante con la purga. Tratamos de dejar gobiernas a s mismos y que fallamos, por lo que ahora el hombre va a establecer algunas reglas. Es cierto, no puedo decir que estoy terriblemente molesto.

 Hola, el tiempo Sombrero serio.
1 / S, soy un troll. Yo era un troll en la escuela secundaria en BBSes, en la universidad en los tablones de anuncios de CMU, me encontr con un foro que fue ms o menos mis amigos curricn entre s, etc. Hago bastante buena imitacin de un ejecutivo de tecnologa profesional cuando lo necesito, sin duda lo suficientemente bien como para entender por qu algo como por ejemplo, el evento dehrmann vera muy poco profesional, pero esa situacin slo tena algunos factores realmente extraos en ella. Y en realidad, no se puede posiblemente ejecutar un sitio como este, sin ser fundamentalmente un troll y entender el trolling. Cuando se anunci que yo era el director general, la reaccin de cada amigo que saba que me estaba uniformemente carcajadas.
Antes de venir a trabajar para reddit, ya sabes lo que he usado mi cuenta? Hacer comentarios trolls / inteligentes para el karma. Usted probablemente puede encontrarlos si se desplaza camino de regreso a antes de 2012. Es agradable ser capaz de volver a ser un usuario normal reddit (yo no poda publicar bajo mi nombre mucho mientras Ellen era CEO porque pareca que lo hara causar demasiada interferencia), aunque tal vez voy a utilizar un alt para atraer menos atencin.
2 / No te preocupes por mi carrera. No tengo planes para trabajar en la industria de la tecnologa de nuevo; Creo que es hora de hacer algo ms, probablemente algo que no implica tener un trabajo asalariado. Tengo un buen dinero ahorrado de mi tiempo en Facebook para poder hacer esto, as que soy muy afortunado. Es cierto que no hice mucho de correr reddit, pero deliberadamente tom un salario inferior para reducir el consumo efectivo y por lo que podra dar algunos empleados mal pagados un aumento. Curiosamente, he recibido dos ofertas de trabajo en el ltimo da o dos, a pesar de mi supuesta unhireability. Imagnate.
Tambin, por favor no acechar a mi esposa - ella es una persona muy reservada, introvertida que no le gusta la atencin y es molesto / divertido por la atencin que he recibido / instigado en la prensa ltimamente.
3 / Me gusta spez mucho, y espero que lo consigue. El resto del equipo tambin es muy bueno; Espero que nadie se va. El trabajo es muy, muy duro y est abriendo un nuevo camino - no ha habido una comunidad (al estilo de foro) de este tamao en el Internet nunca, y los desafos de la gestin de los an mucho ms pequeos han sido bien documentada . Ahora entiendo por qu los presidentes y ex presidentes pasar el rato juntos y esas cosas, a pesar de sus diferencias polticas supuestos (y spez y me parece que tienen un poco justo en comn, incluso).
No parece que estaba equivocado acerca de / r / coontown especficamente (puedo predecir cosas direccionalmente pero todava estoy en el exterior como todos ustedes), pero estoy contento de ver que reddit est tratando primero un mtodo de marginar a la negativa subreddits. No creo que lugares como / r / BDSMCommunity tienen nada de qu preocuparse. Estoy seguro de que habr un montn de ida y vuelta en las polticas, que es necesaria para averiguar lo que funciona.

 The other day, my landlord was in my apartment to change out the furnace filter. They called me at work to tell me that my co2 detector was out of battery and that it's very important to make sure that the batteries are changed regularly etc etc. I understood the severity of the situation, but I said, "Oh, that little thing plugged into the wall, behind the treadmill?" to which they replied, "umm...yes...?" and I said, "Oh yeah, I try not to look over there because first thing I see is the treadmill, and then I see the dust on the treadmill, which just conjures up the shame of being fat and out of shape...so I pretty much avoid thinking about anything that is over there."
Now, at this point, the landlord could have done one of two things. They could have taken me completely seriously, and chastised me on the importance of this. as I could be dead... because, yes, it is technically a serious life or death issue. However, the landlord laughed and said, "If you don't have life insurance, I can certainly sign you up! Hell, I'll even fill out the beneficiary part for you!"
Being offended and chastising someone for finding a way to digest and internalize the morbidity of life accomplishes nothing. Making light of morbid situations appears in countless media through the ages, and it crosses international, racial and ethnic boundaries. We see it throughout thousands of years of literature, in writings from the most exalted authors and works, many of which are still taught in our schools.
To say that Shakespeare should be banned because he occasionally made light of death and murder, for example, tacitly denies the way that we, as a whole, have always processed these sorts of issues. People inherently need to hear this and feel a need to share and relate these feelings with others in order to feel okay about it.
Other people see this as disgusting because the way they learned to process it was merely different. Many of the offended indignant have grown up in settings where these issues were internalized and processed within their families by sharing and expressing a hyperbolic sense of seriousness with others, relating to each other by talking about how serious it is, and making themselves feel safe and secure about it by citing and mutually exalting their moral platitudes, because the only way that they have been able to feel okay about these things is by filling themselves with a rigid seriousness about it. They often adopt this hyperbolic seriousness from their upbringing as that is how they were modeled and taught to share it with others in order to process it. So the thing they wish to share is this seriousness. The problem they don't realize is that there are multiple ways to process these things even if they don't have any personal experience with facilitating the feelings in a humorous way. Making sure that everyone else is taking it with the same perspective is the only way to push and promote the personal sense of security, because if everyone else isn't being serious, then we're not internalizing it properly, are we? enter chaos, anarchy, lawlessness, slippery slope blah blah blah
This is their perspective: (expressed by someone who has spent a good amount of time around these types) The idea of processing these things with humor seems foolish, useless and counterproductive. It makes light of a serious issue while accomplishing nothing except embracing a hedonistic ignorance of the real issue. (seriousness being the real issue, not the issue itself)
They don't know how to feel secure by making fun, only by making and promoting standards that are going to 'protect everyone the way they've protected me'.

 It's interesting that you mention that because I met Martin Lawrence during the premier of his new film at Cannes, Welcome Home, Roscoe Jenkins, and I was shocked to discover that he in fact did not look like Martin Lawrence. It's a perk of my job that I get to travel to see movies so when I discovered that only one year later after I had already steeped myself in the semiotics of Walt Becker's instant classic Wild Hogs, that he was very different from what he looked like in Wild Hogs. Different skin tones, his goatee was now a full grown beard, when he sweat in the presence of the everyone under the hot French Rivera sun, Mr. Lawrence would run double time up the steps of the theater and make a bee line for the restroom. It was when I cornered him to get him to autograph my copy of Harvey Weinstein's seminal book "101 Things You Didn't Know About the Filming of Wild Hogs" he went completely white, quite literally. Security had ushered me out before I could inquire further, but it looked as if Lawrence since those tragically reported events is now being assumed by the man who started it all, Mr. Walt Becker. I shan't not tell more because I fear for my lively hood here in Hollywood.

 In that same piece I noticed that everyone being interviewed declined to mention Martin Lawrence's name. I did some digging, and found an old newspaper clipping at my local library about three hooded individuals dumping the body of a man into the river downtown. By cross referencing the height of the men in the photo to iMDB records, I determined the men to be John Travolta, Ray Liotta, and Walt Becker himself. It seems they got in a heated disagreement with Lawrence over the proper way to cook the Hogs after the production of Wild Hogs was finished. Lawrence wanted medium rare but the rest were all hankering for well done. They killed him, and ate the hogs after vowing never to speak of what happened. I obtained this information at great risk to a bus boy from Belize, so be careful who you tell.

 Here's the thing. You said a "melt is a grilled." Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that. As someone who is a scientist who studies grilled cheese, I am telling you, specifically, in grilling, no one calls melts grilled cheese. If you want to be "specific" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing. If you're saying "grilled cheese family" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Meltidae, which includes things from cheesesteaks to hoagies to pizzas. So your reasoning for calling a melt a grilled cheese is because random people "call the melty ones grilled cheese?" Let's get chicken parmesan and hamburgers in there, then, too. Also, calling someone a grain or a bread? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A melt is a melt and a member of the grilled cheese family. But that's not what you said. You said a melt is a grilled cheese, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the grilled cheese family grilled cheese, which means you'd call hoagies, pizzas, and other melty things grilled cheese, too. Which you said you don't. It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?

Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.

As someone who is a scientist who studies pedophiles, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls ephebophiles pedophiles. If you want to be "specific" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.

If you're saying "pedophile family" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of *chronophilia*, which includes things from nepophiles to hebephiles to gerontophiles.

So your reasoning for calling a ephebophile a pedophile is because random people "call the perverts pedophiles?" Let's get foot fetishists and masochists in there, then, too.

Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. An ephebophile is an ephebophile and part of the pedophile family. But that's not what you said. You said an ephebophile is a pedophile, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the chronophilia family pedophiles, which means you'd call people who chase cougars and grannies pedophiles too.

 If that's not the sign of a true piece of art, I don't know what is.
I like to think I'm a pretty good dad to my 2 little girls, but as other parents probably know, it's easy to lose perspective during the day-to-day of bedtimes, baths, tantrums and picky eating.
But after seeing the film, all I wanted to do was go home, wake them up and give them a hug (I let them finish their long nap).
Three days later, I'm still carrying the film around in my head. And it's impacting my interactions with my kids. No more distractions. No more "hurry up and get them to bed so I can watch football." I'm treasuring every moment with them. What other movie, about SPACE, no less, has that sort of impact?
Now if I can only figure out how to manipulate gravity to send morse code to my daughter's LCD Frozen watch....

 Another Asian guy here: let me dissect the pass white supremacists seem to give us...

Don't believe it for a second. They use the successes of Asian-Americans only as a club to bash other races with, and to get them to resent us instead of them. White supremacists will often rate Asian people as smarter than Whites, but that is just because it looks completely self-serving in whatever racial "ranking" system they decide to conjure to always put themselves at the top of it.

In reality, white racists have hated us from the jump. They allowed a certain number of us to immigrate because we were cheaper labor than blacks, and when it looked like too many of us were coming over, they restricted our immigration so only a token number of us could ever take hold. 

Asians were always at a numerical disadvantage, which is why we had to keep our heads down and take their shit instead of fighting back. We were the original racialized druggie stereotype. Your black kid in a hoodie slanging crack in the 19th century was a Chinaman with his opium pipe. They put Japanese in concentration camps in WWII to steal their farm land. And because we managed to survive their game, they want to grant us honorary cracker status?

I've no problem with white people, but white racists can all go to hell. Chinese, Japanese, look at these dirty knees? Everytime you racists said that to me, I wanted to take my knee to your face until it was bone-splintered pulp and I'll slit your throats the moment I catch you slipping. Keep that in mind whenever you think I'm a model minority.

 Flippity floppity go her labia minora as Kathy Ireland runs from the big hard rapist. It, the fli-fluh, was happening her labia majora were ineffectual in preventing.

But on this rapish night, her inspiringly long vaginal lips, which had on so many occasions caused her grief and visits to the ground via tripping, was to be an advantage.

Flip flap, flip flap, she runs. And the rape man follows. Kate, who, in her state if panicked confusion, at that very moment decided she would begin (surviving this of course) the paperwork necessary to finally change her name to how she'd always wanted it, "Mommy Longlips", turned to take a great good gander at her pursuer. She saw him bouldering towards her, big and black in the night. It's when she saw the wart on his junk, gleaming by the headlights of the cars who would pass by and honk and speed away, that she really, I mean REALLY, got to running.

Flip flap flip flap, flofloflofloflo, uh oh, what's this? her lips are - no - they're acting as a set of wings! Look! Hark! There she goes! Propelled away by the beefy things that caused her to become a target for the mad rapist now shaking his fist powerlessly at the sky where she flies in the first place.

Where will she go? To what extent, exactly, does she have control over her newfound, and glorious, brown-winged mode of transport? She shifts her weight to the side, as on a motorcycle, but the flofloflo won't let her budge. She cocks a leg, as a dog to pee on a hydrant, and: success! she turns, motating amazingly to her will. She does a 180 to look back at her rapist-hopefull. He is a speck, a wart on the sidewalk. She is gone. To fly toward Voyager 1 to recover that golden record and to hawk it at a pawn shop for the sweet sweet green.

 Just because it's popular here doesn't mean it's popular where it matters. This movie is an underrated masterpiece that flew over people's heads because it wasn't as straightforward as, say, Avatar. This is a true modern art film, only comparable to maybe Interstellar and Mad Max (another 2 movies that are very unappreciated by the Kevin James/Melissa McCarthey masses). It was so refreshing to watch an actual mature film for mature audiences,  but I guess good R-rated movies are not for everyone.


I think Karl Urban's performance comfortably fits among the best ever, alongside Ledger's The Joker and Jake Gyllenhal in Nightcrawler. It's just a very raw and dark performance that really resonates with the current state of cinema where snappy happy-go-lucky acting is so celebrated.


You wouldn't be criticizing Dredd if you were a true cinephile, so I advise everyone to dive into the vast sea of artistic and obscure films, and not just what the mainstream media spoonfeeds to you. For every film like Spy, Grown Ups, and Prometheus, there's a masterpiece waiting to be discovered, true film like John Wick, The Raid 2, and of course, Dredd. Open yourself to true cinema, you might be surprised what you find in the vast cinematic vault.

 Seems like if you hate feminists talking about the internet so much you should just stop going on the Internet. Frankly, if you go on the internet it's *kind of* entirely your fault and no one else's if you get outraged by SJWs. Like, honestly, how obvious is that? Once you go on the Internet, you got no one to blame but yourself if you overhear someone saying that objectifying women should be discouraged or that black people don't think jokes about them stealing bikes are funny. Turn off the computer. Ignore it. Don't go on twitter or Reddit or Tumblr or anywhere, really. 

Look, Feminists are going to use the Internet. And they are going to talk about it. If you overhear one talking about how saying you're going to "rape" someone is terrible, and that makes you feel raincloud that's *your* fault. You went on twitter. You had to know some woman was going to ask for more minorities to be protagonists in video games. You can't blame Anita, buddy, and you've got no right to complain.

Wearing that fedora and those cargo shorts, Cheetos on your breath. You wanted to get upset and faux offended about nothing.

 Yeah, and I smell a comeback to past sensibilities in cinema that feels like a breath of fresh air. No more post-modern deconstruction and self-aware reinvention, no more ironic referencing of the past, just straight up followings of the rules of art.

There's a grandeur that comes from simply playing it straight (shown here in the camera work, the choice of the shots, the editing, the music) that faded over the decades by excess and desire of reinvention. A technique that is mastered but self-erases leaves place to the spectacle, it doesn't exist simply trying to show off how original and ground breaking the director is and let the stuff speak for itself, it is more immersive than gimmicks. Here, there's no excessive underlining and trying to make it more and more impactful to a more and more desensitized audience by forcing fancy camera tricks that more often removes you out of the experience than anything else.

We need to go back there, re-sensitize ourselves to older, more subtle and ''sage'' esthetics, because the path we've taken is a debilitating dead-end. Movies shouldn't over-stimulate you to the point of killing your sensitivity, it should exercise that sensitivity, and a Big scale underrated gem movie is no reason to go against that. It's no easy feat to balance such movies. I didn't see much footage of Avatar, I don't know if it succeeded, but from this and another trailer I've seen, there might be a chance.

I'm saying this here, but I trullly feel like we're slowly going back to some great cinema. I won't get hyped for the movie, but it caught my attention for sure.

 If we ban pics of girls we should just do a sitewide ban of guy pics as well. We can't have feminists fingerbanging to underage boys.

In fact, let's just ban ANY pic just to be on the safe side.

This is really just a censorship issue. There's porn of all kinds on every single site out there. There's BARELY LEGAL TEEN porn which is extremely popular. Hell, even Brooke Shields and Traci Lords put underage porn into MAINSTREAM MOVIES.
Sure we shouldn't be sexualizing naked children, but if you're going to start banning legal content just for the sake of hoping to catch illegal content, how is that any different than an officer firing into the crowd of a fleeing robber with a shotgun just to make sure he gets the bad guy?

Do just like any other site: do your DUE DILIGENCE to remove any illegal content just as any site would. But it's definitely not your responsibility to police ALL content. That's just impossible. Even 4chan is notorious for DAILY KIDDIE PORN PICS. but the mods remove them as soon as they can because they CAN'T be held accountable for other people's posts otherwise reddit would likewise be held liable for ANY instance of an illegal pic.

Even Iggy Azalea made a child porn video where she tried to seduce an underage little boy with her pussy. That was allowed on YOUTUBE. So let's not get ahead of ourselves here. It's really not about the images themselves as much as the gatekeepers in charge of SEXUALIZING THE CONTEXT according to their feminist agenda.

I've seen pics on reddit of parents and strangers posting pics of naked kids playing in a bathtub or near the shower. If ALL naked children are to be removed, those would fall under 'illegal'.

If something is sexualizing a child in an obvious manner, we can remove it, no problem. But if someone is using their feminist liberal agenda to say "THAT is sexual TO ME" then we should tell them to fuck off. I mean social justice warriors support and still buy Lena Dunham's book where she admits to MOLESTING HER LITTLE SISTER. Except it's not considered molestation because the Social Justice Warriors are in charge of setting the context. Instead of Lena Dunham the CHILD MOLESTER touching her sister's vagina, it's warped into a fun childhood game of innocent curiosity. Again, it all depends on the gatekeepers interpretation of events.

Our goal should be to stand against censorship, not give it an excuse to GROW.

 Without meaning to sound condescending, I really think you should endeavour to excavate a little deeper into the mineshaft of cinema. Dumb action-flicks and superhero films are the common metals near the top of the mineshaft. They're completely accessible: everybody 'gets' them. You don't have to do much work to get the shallow sort of no-frills 'entertainment' they provide.


However, something which most teenagers are not yet aware of, is that down there in the mineshaft is a wealth of precious gems so beautiful and so thought-provoking that if you experienced them, you would never want to go back to the rather common and mundane stuff on the surface. Down there are films that can make you cry and leave you in a state of heightened emotion for days. Down there are films that can change your perspective of how you view your own life, or how you view other people. Down there are films that will worm their way into your brain and start to become a part of your identity.

But you can't just leap down the mineshaft. If your diet consists of Transformers, Harry Potters and Avengers, you will break your neck if you try to dive straight for the Blade Runners and the American Beautys. Challenge yourself to dig downwards. Watch films from as many different genres, time-periods and cultures as you can. Try to inch away from your comfort zone. 

Again: please don't think me as being condescending. This isn't an intelligence thing. People who appreciate the "depressing philosophical bullshit" of films like Birdman aren't more intelligent than you. They've just put more time into exploring cinema and adventuring into their own personal mineshaft. I know it seems comfortable at the top, but I can promise you that digging is very, very worth your time.

 Holy lack of imagination, Batman!

* Expanded voting rights gave more of a say to individual families with more daughters than sons.
* Expanded rights to enter into legal agreements and hold property made sure that a father's legacy stayed with his blood and wasn't passed down to sons-in-law or brothers he hates.
* Birth control and abortion helped stem the spread of STDs and prevented many unwilling adults from becoming fathers.
* Equal pay and protected class status doubles the pool of potential graduates and employees, making sure that the highest level of achievement, scholarship, and innovation is pushed higher, faster than before.
* Sexual revolutions and relaxed prudishness made women more willing to experiment in bed and more knowledgeable about how to instruct men to please them and how to please men because being sexual and a woman isn't as stigmatized anymore.
* Alimony and child support for both genders has guaranteed single parents income and support for their children, even in hard economic times or when divorce upends personal finances
* Dismantling the homemaker / docile wife institution has increased the GDP of the country
* It struck down a law that lowered the drinking age for women, but not men, because they were "less responsible" (Craig v. Boren)
* It asked the FBI to change the definition of rape to include men
* It allows new masculinities to flourish with less social backlash. Men can be gentler, more fashionable, more feminine, and more sensitive without being as stigmatized for having a rich emotional life as they used to.
* FMLA gives men time off work as well.
* Opening the armed services to women, and eventually opening the front lines, helped the burden of war not fall entirely on men.
* Working women help men stay home and raise children, go back to school, and try to start their own businesses without fear of going homeless and broke.
* NOW and women's rights groups have always been participants in hate crime legislation against blacks, gays, and other minorities (many of which are men).
* Pushes towards better representation of women in media have also expanded the roles that men can play.
* Feminists have struck down legislation that discriminated against men in traditionally female fields like nursing and teaching

Now, if MRAs can say that the MRM has done half of that for men, let alone *women*, I'd eat my own shoe.

Supongo que una vez Coontown finalmente ha ido, el problema "negro" se resolver y todo el mundo puede vivir en paz y armona, verdad? Hechos Banning cambiarn la realidad.

No te preocupes, cucks. Seguiremos siendo alrededor. Estamos en todas partes. Somos su familia, sus vecinos, sus compaeros de trabajo. Estamos con usted cada vez que utilice el GPS para evitar un barrio "malo". Estamos con usted cuando usted hace que la decisin de no comprar en "ese lugar" a causa de "esas personas". Estamos con usted cuando usted hace que la decisin de comprar una casa en un barrio blanco, porque "las escuelas son tan buenas."
Usted puede hacer excusas para ti mismo, pero ya sabemos la verdad. Ya eres racista. Usted sabe que, inconscientemente. Usted simplemente no va a admitir a ti mismo. A tomar decisiones todos los das para evitar que los negros. Cuando usted hace compras. 

Quin te la fecha. Donde trabajas. Donde ir a socializar.

Usted ya segregar a s mismo de ellos, y lo sabes. 

Eres ... como yo.

 Bud, you have no clue what you're talking about. You haven't read *Why Lift* and therefore haven't the first fucking clue with which ethical/aesthetic criteria Snyder was dismissive of traditional workout conventions. You haven't read *Paleo Me Plenty*. You don't, for example, know another great regimen Snyder dismissed, or why. You aren't making an effort to truly digest or engage in an ongoing dialogue so much as corroding it. But perhaps you're over-rating Snyder as the greatest lifting director of all time. He's just ripped, therefore people think he lifts. Peter Jackson's bulking is just the same as Snyder's lazy 3x5 rep routine.

I could drop so much advanced fitness jargon on you, it would make your head spin, but I won't. Instead, I'll simply point out that you don't know what any of the different modes of dead lifts are, or how they seize upon muscle tissue regeneration. You've never read and don't know who people like Milo of Croton, Galen, or Frederic Delavier are- and those are just the biggies. You've read/seen next to no classic weight training, if any. Certainly not scholastically. You googled some shit about admiring physiques and copy/pasted something written in /r/fitness that you have no basis for understanding. You- yes the dumb, blind, sheltered little product of the exercise industry that you are, contribute to our world's and muscle tissue degradation. (You don't even know what that means because you don't know what good form is). You insult what you're ignorant about. And that's a really shitty thing to do. I suggest you take an honest personal inventory, and then try to make something better of yourself. Because right now, you're pretty fucking disgusting to read. Honestly, I think you should be ashamed of yourself, and should consider apologizing to this thread.

Querido Hijo Varn Cojida,

Siento que ya no soy 16. de hecho he crecido, mis testculos han descendido, y mientras lo hago pasar una gran cantidad de tiempo en Internet - de hecho, mi trabajo es la construccin y reparacin de aplicaciones web - probablemente los es posible que haya utilizado, yo crezco cansado de mierda de internet.

Me alegro de que hayas encontrado 4chan y Reddit, pero saba usted, hay aproximadamente 180 millones de sitios web, ms o menos? La mayora de ellos lo hacen cosas como ropa y prestamos de noticias, o un blog acerca de su gato. O porno. Hay un montn de porno. Usted se sorprendera de que los memes desu, n **** r chistes y brosites MRA son jodidamente pequea porcin de la internet. No 0,1 por ciento. Ni siquiera cerca.

As que cuando me hablas acerca de la "Internet real" - Construyo la verdadera internet. Corro cables de red, servidores en rack, analizar los malos errores de espacio de nombres, corregir 500s, reconstruir matrices RAID, y hacer la mierda que hace la verdadera mierda internet - donde las personas se comportan como lo hacen en la vida real.

Su anonimato no te hace fuerte. Te hace mierda dbil. Usted ha decidido sus instintos ms bajos pertenecen en Internet en lugar de su humanidad, y permites que la gente como Ellen Pao y Anita Sarkeesian a tomar la cada para usted. No teme la prdida de la libertad de expresin - temes el requisito de ser un puto persona real en Internet. Tener que escuchar a su oposicin, tratarlos con decencia humana bsica y la compasin y posiblemente cambiar su mente de mierda.

Tienes miedo de rendicin de cuentas. Soy dueo de toda palabra que he dicho aqu, incluso las palabras me he lamentado profundamente. Soy fcil de alcanzar y mi verdadero nombre ha sido dado a conocer en varias ocasiones. Soy amigo de varios usuarios aqu. Mi Twitter y Google+ describen ambas mi verdadero nombre, y la mayora de la gente aqu sabe donde trabajo. Si lo desea, con mucho gusto comparto.

T, que utilizara sin irona un trmino como hugbox, est ocupado furiosa por la prdida de su cuenta. Usted necesita los chans, porque no poda soportar conmigo de hombre a hombre. Usted tiene que publicar "Lol U Mad Bro" memes, porque usted no est lo suficientemente maduro para aceptar las crticas constructivas con voz severa.

El resto de la Internet est creciendo de una puta vez. Twitter y Facebook estn difundiendo noticias y ayudar a combatientes de la libertad buscan la democracia. Tambin eran un medio para permitir que el odio se propague, pero estn trabajando para arreglar eso.

Honestamente, tengo una nueva relacin, un nuevo apartamento que todava necesita un poco de retoque, un trabajo a tiempo completo, y una variedad de actividades recreativas y los compromisos familiares. Tiempo de mierda Internet no est en esa lista. Mis notificaciones telefnicas son una parte integral de mi existencia - no puedo elegir para apagarlos durante tres horas. Conseguir brigaded no me hace llorar, o daar mi autoestima uno puto pice. Es un desperdicio de mi tiempo de mierda sin embargo, y por extrao que, cuando te haces mayor, empiezas a tratarlo ms como el precioso recurso que es, y llorar el tiempo cuando era ms joven que se desperdicia en cosas como una mierda internet.

Ningn adulto vale su sal nunca va a decir - "Me gustara reprim ms homosexuales y las mujeres y los gorditos de / b / cuando era ms joven."

Yo tambin estoy recibiendo hasta el punto en que podra querer tener un hijo, y si ella es una hija, quiero que ella sea capaz de vivir su vida libre de desprecio basado nicamente en el hecho de que ella tiene un par de tetas y que 're capaz de evitar mi retribucin de los padres. Me preocupa qu tipo de internet que estamos dejando atrs, pero lo ms importante, qu clase de gente que estamos dejando atrs. No quiero que mi hija rodeada de gente patticos como usted - la gente que no puede manejar lo ms mnimo de la consternacin sin la construccin de un muro de anonimato y snarking o calumniar en la oscuridad. No temo a su actitud, me temo que su cobarda generalizada, y el barniz pseudo-intelectual que pendejos puse sobre ella - con chorradas como Agenda de Derechos de los Hombres, y Redpilling y igualitarismo y anti-SJW y estos obsesivo puto Gates. Puede haber personas reales con buenas ideas en cada uno de esos grupos, pero usted puede estar seguro como la mierda no es uno de ellos.

As que ahora, se llega a ver la verdadera Internet - lleno de comentarios y el comercio, el discurso y la informacin, la rendicin de cuentas y responsabilidad. Usted puede venir a lo largo de la cogida, o puede ejecutar de nuevo a su hugbox, pero no me eches la culpa cuando el mundo cambia a su alrededor.

Atentamente,

de pollo sin grasa, Adulto.

 So, here's the thing:

When you go to any sort of "I have a problem" support group, inevitably up comes the question: "How did you know you had a problem?"

Lots of people I've worked with never knew they had a problem until something weird brought it up. They almost never listen to their friends or loved ones or professionals or anything. they listen to little kids pointing out their drinking, or a random dog growling at them because they're getting so angry, or, famously, Robert Downy Jr eating a shitty burger king burger and realizing how low his life had gotten.

Point is, when it comes to people getting help, most of them end up getting that final kick from left field. They're so used to filtering out the normal nagging voices that it takes an outside force often to make them aware. The whole thing about a frog in its own slowly boiling water.

I don't think 99% of the folk I've talked to on the Internet have listened to my advice, but maybe one of them did. Or just thought about it.  But I've met enough people in treatment centers that have stories of random "truths" from strangers that I don't shy away from it anymore.

 Flippity floppity go her labia minora as Kathy Ireland runs from the big hard rapist. It, the fli-fluh, was happening her labia majora were ineffectual in preventing.

But on this rapish night, her inspiringly long vaginal lips, which had on so many occasions caused her grief and visits to the ground via tripping, was to be an advantage.

Flip flap, flip flap, she runs. And the rape man follows. Kate, who, in her state if panicked confusion, at that very moment decided she would begin (surviving this of course) the paperwork necessary to finally change her name to how she'd always wanted it, "Mommy Longlips", turned to take a great good gander at her pursuer. She saw him bouldering towards her, big and black in the night. It's when she saw the wart on his junk, gleaming by the headlights of the cars who would pass by and honk and speed away, that she really, I mean REALLY, got to running.

Flip flap flip flap, flofloflofloflo, uh oh, what's this? her lips are - no - they're acting as a set of wings! Look! Hark! There she goes! Propelled away by the beefy things that caused her to become a target for the mad rapist now shaking his fist powerlessly at the sky where she flies in the first place.

Where will she go? To what extent, exactly, does she have control over her newfound, and glorious, brown-winged mode of transport? She shifts her weight to the side, as on a motorcycle, but the flofloflo won't let her budge. She cocks a leg, as a dog to pee on a hydrant, and: success! she turns, motating amazingly to her will. She does a 180 to look back at her rapist-hopefull. He is a speck, a wart on the sidewalk. She is gone. To fly toward Voyager 1 to recover that golden record and to hawk it at a pawn shop for the sweet sweet green. 




 I'd rather see Hellboy deal with something small for the third film considering they're not going to get the money for that and hold it over for number 4. Do something like the Baba Yaga storyline.  




 Because Del Toro doesn't want to do it. He has 40 other projects that he's definitely sure he can get done by next year. 




 You can say anything you want about Stargate, BUT DONT YOU DARE TOUCH ANIME.

 My favorite articles are on ArticleCity, it's where these content mill chumps usually used to sell tons of articles to. Here's my favorite called "How to be famous like Justin Bieber."

Do you want to become famous? And do you want to become famous like Justin Bieber did? Well what if I was to tell you that it's not actually that hard to do? 

Bieber may be too criticized by many but is a great example of what the marketing, social networking and other elements can do. 

First Bieber began releasing their videos through YouTube, a platform that has given 5 minutes of fame to many people, but these 5 minutes stretched into years due to other internet tools... Twitter. 

If we learn from the biography of Justin Bieber is that if someone wants to become famous, should begin now to put their videos (as real as possible) on YouTube, because you never know who might "accidentally" discover your talent for delight the young fans. This is exactly what has happened to Justin Bieber. 

Twitter really help Bieber began to attract attention from your target market. Many marketers still do not understand the scope that is Twitter users and yet this was the platform that Justin used to engage with your audience. Justin currently offer your movie called "Never Say Never" (never say never), a type of documentary which presents the story of the singer and how he came to where he is now. 

And of course had to take a perfume especially for girls called "someday" but the video is a little weird and may even get you a laugh, in two days has reached the 2 million views. A very good example is Google; that is starting to become obsessed with the pop stars. This search engine company has made a change in its marketing strategy. Last month, he joined Lady Gaga in an ad to show all the opportunities offered by the Chrome browser. Now he has done the same with Justin Bieber. 

The announcement is similar to Gaga, but also shares some similarities with the recent announcement Dear Sophie, which shows a father using Chrome and other Google products to remember her daughter's childhood. 

It makes sense that Google has thought Bieber for their promotion. The young celebrity was discovered thanks to his performances uploaded to Youtube. And with it, Google manages to reach an important demographic: teenage girls. 

One of his secrets: Its well-defined market. 

Justin Bieber is not intended that all are his fans; he knows it would be almost impossible, yet the market for young girls have it well controlled. So it adds the elements of marketing, good use of digital tools and a well-defined market and the rest is history. 




 young people are flocking to terrorist groups like ISIS, i know you are joking but i believe you could actually create your very own "red pill army" if you really wanted to. 




 Recently I've become quite heartened about the long-term future of our society, because I've noticed how astronomically, incredibly well I've done in my career since I swallowed the pill. I seriously doubt I'm unusual in this respect; in 20 years time more than a few of us are going to be in positions of serious power and we may see some positive change from that alone. No need to invade anyone, climb the ladder and shit on the degenerates from above. 









 I would fight both at the same because they're not real and cannot stand my combat skills in combat, you internat infants. 

give me gold you infants.

We will be united in our common interests.



Perhaps its fate that today is the 4th of July, and you will once again be fighting for our freedom, not from tyranny, oppression, or persecution -- but from annihilation.

We're fighting for our right to live, to exist.

And should we win the day, the 4th of July will no longer be known as an American holiday, but as the day when the world declared in one voice:

"We will not go quietly into the night!

We will not vanish without a fight!

We're going to live on!

We're going to survive!"

Today, we celebrate our Independence Day! 




 HEAR THAT HITLER? LET NO MAN STEAL UR TYME. 




 Who do you like? Einstein left his wife to raise their two children alone, including a schizophrenic child -- for his cousin. Gandhi urged his wife not to accept Western medicine based on religious beliefs, and she died of a highly curable disease in prison. When Gandhi got the same disease next month, he took the Western medicine and cured himself. Bob Marley had more kids with more women than Thomas Jefferson did with his slaves. How about George Washington? Another person who owned people as if they were objects, forcing them to live their whole lives, generation after generation in poverty. Che? There is one man who led a rather prestige private life. Christian, vegetarian, not an alcoholic, probably never tried any drugs. He even started the fight against smoking. His name is Adolf Hitler. Chose wisely why you dismiss someone and why you follow them. Bill Clinton was by far a better president than Bush (he caused much less pain worldwide than Bush did) but I think anyone would agree that Clinton is morally bankrupt when compared to Bush in their private lives.

 Without meaning to sound condescending, I really think you should endeavour to excavate a little deeper into the mineshaft of cinema. Dumb action-flicks and superhero films are the common metals near the top of the mineshaft. They're completely accessible: everybody 'gets' them. You don't have to do much work to get the shallow sort of no-frills 'entertainment' they provide.

However, something which most teenagers are not yet aware of, is that down there in the mineshaft is a wealth of precious gems so beautiful and so thought-provoking that if you experienced them, you would never want to go back to the rather common and mundane stuff on the surface. Down there are films that can make you cry and leave you in a state of heightened emotion for days. Down there are films that can change your perspective of how you view your own life, or how you view other people. Down there are films that will worm their way into your brain and start to become a part of your identity.

But you can't just leap down the mineshaft. If your diet consists of Transformers, Harry Potters and Avengers, you will break your neck if you try to dive straight for the Blade Runners and the American Beautys. Challenge yourself to dig downwards. Watch films from as many different genres, time-periods and cultures as you can. Try to inch away from your comfort zone. 

Again: please don't think me as being condescending. This isn't an intelligence thing. People who appreciate the "depressing philosophical bullshit" of films like Birdman aren't more intelligent than you. They've just put more time into exploring cinema and adventuring into their own personal mineshaft. I know it seems comfortable at the top, but I can promise you that digging is very, *very* worth your time. 




 Why should I care who moderates SRD? They're not journalists and they're not really beholden to some sort of major ethical agreement to run their subs according to an original intent from Reddit corporate. All they have a responsibility is to enforce the rules that they set for the sub and make sure it isn't "breaking Reddit," per se. 

Other than that, it's up to you how you want to browse. I don't see the point of going to war over this when the clear solution is anti-brigading tools and more access to Reddit's statistical data on brigading. Reddit ad infinitum. You keep using Reddit and Reddit keeps making money and chugging along. So far only brigading statistical data comes from people who do it themselves.

Considering this is a free market place of ideas, then the market place is working. People are curating the ideas they want and if they don't like ideas somewhere else they create a new branch. 

Why call them cancer? That just seems like crazy talk as well. You have the ability to create any sub you want and curate the content that you want. This seems like such a childish reactionary response. The only reason I can see people calling other moderators cancer is that they want the same audience that those moderators have.  




 Flippity floppity go her labia minora as Kathy Ireland runs from the big hard rapist. It, the fli-fluh, was happening her labia majora were ineffectual in preventing.

But on this rapish night, her inspiringly long vaginal lips, which had on so many occasions caused her grief and visits to the ground via tripping, was to be an advantage.

Flip flap, flip flap, she runs. And the rape man follows. Kate, who, in her state if panicked confusion, at that very moment decided she would begin (surviving this of course) the paperwork necessary to finally change her name to how she'd always wanted it, "Mommy Longlips", turned to take a great good gander at her pursuer. She saw him bouldering towards her, big and black in the night. It's when she saw the wart on his junk, gleaming by the headlights of the cars who would pass by and honk and speed away, that she really, I mean REALLY, got to running.

Flip flap flip flap, flofloflofloflo, uh oh, what's this? her lips are - no - they're acting as a set of wings! Look! Hark! There she goes! Propelled away by the beefy things that caused her to become a target for the mad rapist now shaking his fist powerlessly at the sky where she flies in the first place.

Where will she go? To what extent, exactly, does she have control over her newfound, and glorious, brown-winged mode of transport? She shifts her weight to the side, as on a motorcycle, but the flofloflo won't let her budge. She cocks a leg, as a dog to pee on a hydrant, and: success! she turns, motating amazingly to her will. She does a 180 to look back at her rapist-hopefull. He is a speck, a wart on the sidewalk. She is gone. To fly toward Voyager 1 to recover that golden record and to hawk it at a pawn shop for the sweet sweet green.

 Who do you like? Einstein left his wife to raise their two children alone, including a schizophrenic child -- for his cousin. Gandhi urged his wife not to accept Western medicine based on religious beliefs, and she died of a highly curable disease in prison. When Gandhi got the same disease next month, he took the Western medicine and cured himself. Bob Marley had more kids with more women than Thomas Jefferson did with his slaves. How about George Washington? Another person who owned people as if they were objects, forcing them to live their whole lives, generation after generation in poverty. Che? There is one man who led a rather prestige private life. Christian, vegetarian, not an alcoholic, probably never tried any drugs. He even started the fight against smoking. His name is Adolf Hitler. Chose wisely why you dismiss someone and why you follow them. Bill Clinton was by far a better president than Bush (he caused much less pain worldwide than Bush did) but I think anyone would agree that Clinton is morally bankrupt when compared to Bush in their private lives.

 I'm uncomfortable going into this area because, again, without these anti-brigade tools we're going to be bashing each other over the head with benign Reddit history about "SRS taking over a sub," which is a weird claim anyway. SRD has double the subscribers of SRS and is ten times more active so where does SRS eventually come in? So *all* the people that post there are going to get whipped with the same cream because of general claims of brigading? 

I know that most stuff that gets linked is usually around hot button issues, and the reasons these are linked are because these are usually the issues that attract the most hot headed people, hence the sub is functioning as it's supposed to. However, I don't understand what the function of the sub is supposed to be. The moderators of SRD are already cracking down on shitposting and they also work closely with the admins to ensure that brigading is kept to a minimum. Other than that I'm sensing you have a specific position about this. 

Ultimately, it's up to the moderators to choose how that sub is run and I don't really see the point in arguing about who's community is more conservative and who's more progressive because these are arbitrary to the ultimate use of Reddit which is to curate communities of people who want to talk to each other the way they want, how they want, with the people they want. And Reddit seems to not care about these wars because the goal is to keep you using Reddit. Anything else is arbitrary.  




 yeah well. you don't know moon so there.

 La pldora roja es de 120 mil hombres con estudios universitarios de clase media de ajuste. Si realmente queramos podamos invadir Nueva Zelanda e instalar un nuevo gobierno. Definitivamente tenemos la mano de obra . Hay un montn de veteranos aqu . Adems todo el mundo aqu sabe que la liberacin del cargador est en un M16 , a partir de aos de jugar Call Of Duty.

Siendo realistas la Fuerza de Reaccin Red Pill sera mucho ms eficaz que la media militares del mundo. El ejrcito afgano est jodido en el opio. El ejrcito iraqu no puede incluso hacer saltos . Plus Nueva Zelanda tiene slo 8.000 efectivos militares de la mayora de los cuales son empujadores de papel intiles .

Yo en realidad no apoyo el derrocamiento violento de Nueva Zelanda . Yo slo creo que es un poco una idea divertida Conceptualy . 




 
Querido Hijo Varn Cojida,

Siento que ya no soy 16. de hecho he crecido, mis testculos han descendido, y mientras lo hago pasar una gran cantidad de tiempo en Internet - de hecho, mi trabajo es la construccin y reparacin de aplicaciones web - probablemente los es posible que haya utilizado, yo crezco cansado de mierda de internet.

Me alegro de que hayas encontrado 4chan y Reddit, pero saba usted, hay aproximadamente 180 millones de sitios web, ms o menos? La mayora de ellos lo hacen cosas como ropa y prestamos de noticias, o un blog acerca de su gato. O porno. Hay un montn de porno. Usted se sorprendera de que los memes desu, n **** r chistes y brosites MRA son jodidamente pequea porcin de la internet. No 0,1 por ciento. Ni siquiera cerca.

As que cuando me hablas acerca de la "Internet real" - Construyo la verdadera internet. Corro cables de red, servidores en rack, analizar los malos errores de espacio de nombres, corregir 500s, reconstruir matrices RAID, y hacer la mierda que hace la verdadera mierda internet - donde las personas se comportan como lo hacen en la vida real.

Su anonimato no te hace fuerte. Te hace mierda dbil. Usted ha decidido sus instintos ms bajos pertenecen en Internet en lugar de su humanidad, y permites que la gente como Ellen Pao y Anita Sarkeesian a tomar la cada para usted. No teme la prdida de la libertad de expresin - temes el requisito de ser un puto persona real en Internet. Tener que escuchar a su oposicin, tratarlos con decencia humana bsica y la compasin y posiblemente cambiar su mente de mierda.

Tienes miedo de rendicin de cuentas. Soy dueo de toda palabra que he dicho aqu, incluso las palabras me he lamentado profundamente. Soy fcil de alcanzar y mi verdadero nombre ha sido dado a conocer en varias ocasiones. Soy amigo de varios usuarios aqu. Mi Twitter y Google+ describen ambas mi verdadero nombre, y la mayora de la gente aqu sabe donde trabajo. Si lo desea, con mucho gusto comparto.

T, que utilizara sin irona un trmino como hugbox, est ocupado furiosa por la prdida de su cuenta. Usted necesita los chans, porque no poda soportar conmigo de hombre a hombre. Usted tiene que publicar "Lol U Mad Bro" memes, porque usted no est lo suficientemente maduro para aceptar las crticas constructivas con voz severa.

El resto de la Internet est creciendo de una puta vez. Twitter y Facebook estn difundiendo noticias y ayudar a combatientes de la libertad buscan la democracia. Tambin eran un medio para permitir que el odio se propague, pero estn trabajando para arreglar eso.

Honestamente, tengo una nueva relacin, un nuevo apartamento que todava necesita un poco de retoque, un trabajo a tiempo completo, y una variedad de actividades recreativas y los compromisos familiares. Tiempo de mierda Internet no est en esa lista. Mis notificaciones telefnicas son una parte integral de mi existencia - no puedo elegir para apagarlos durante tres horas. Conseguir brigaded no me hace llorar, o daar mi autoestima uno puto pice. Es un desperdicio de mi tiempo de mierda sin embargo, y por extrao que, cuando te haces mayor, empiezas a tratarlo ms como el precioso recurso que es, y llorar el tiempo cuando era ms joven que se desperdicia en cosas como una mierda internet.

Ningn adulto vale su sal nunca va a decir - "Me gustara reprim ms homosexuales y las mujeres y los gorditos de / b / cuando era ms joven."

Yo tambin estoy recibiendo hasta el punto en que podra querer tener un hijo, y si ella es una hija, quiero que ella sea capaz de vivir su vida libre de desprecio basado nicamente en el hecho de que ella tiene un par de tetas y que 're capaz de evitar mi retribucin de los padres. Me preocupa qu tipo de internet que estamos dejando atrs, pero lo ms importante, qu clase de gente que estamos dejando atrs. No quiero que mi hija rodeada de gente patticos como usted - la gente que no puede manejar lo ms mnimo de la consternacin sin la construccin de un muro de anonimato y snarking o calumniar en la oscuridad. No temo a su actitud, me temo que su cobarda generalizada, y el barniz pseudo-intelectual que pendejos puse sobre ella - con chorradas como Agenda de Derechos de los Hombres, y Redpilling y igualitarismo y anti-SJW y estos obsesivo puto Gates. Puede haber personas reales con buenas ideas en cada uno de esos grupos, pero usted puede estar seguro como la mierda no es uno de ellos.

As que ahora, se llega a ver la verdadera Internet - lleno de comentarios y el comercio, el discurso y la informacin, la rendicin de cuentas y responsabilidad. Usted puede venir a lo largo de la cogida, o puede ejecutar de nuevo a su hugbox, pero no me eches la culpa cuando el mundo cambia a su alrededor.

Atentamente,

de pollo sin grasa, Adulto.

Querido Hijo Varn Cojida,

Siento que ya no soy 16. de hecho he crecido, mis testculos han descendido, y mientras lo hago pasar una gran cantidad de tiempo en Internet - de hecho, mi trabajo es la construccin y reparacin de aplicaciones web - probablemente los es posible que haya utilizado, yo crezco cansado de mierda de internet.

Me alegro de que hayas encontrado 4chan y Reddit, pero saba usted, hay aproximadamente 180 millones de sitios web, ms o menos? La mayora de ellos lo hacen cosas como ropa y prestamos de noticias, o un blog acerca de su gato. O porno. Hay un montn de porno. Usted se sorprendera de que los memes desu, n **** r chistes y brosites MRA son jodidamente pequea porcin de la internet. No 0,1 por ciento. Ni siquiera cerca.

As que cuando me hablas acerca de la "Internet real" - Construyo la verdadera internet. Corro cables de red, servidores en rack, analizar los malos errores de espacio de nombres, corregir 500s, reconstruir matrices RAID, y hacer la mierda que hace la verdadera mierda internet - donde las personas se comportan como lo hacen en la vida real.

Su anonimato no te hace fuerte. Te hace mierda dbil. Usted ha decidido sus instintos ms bajos pertenecen en Internet en lugar de su humanidad, y permites que la gente como Ellen Pao y Anita Sarkeesian a tomar la cada para usted. No teme la prdida de la libertad de expresin - temes el requisito de ser un puto persona real en Internet. Tener que escuchar a su oposicin, tratarlos con decencia humana bsica y la compasin y posiblemente cambiar su mente de mierda.

Tienes miedo de rendicin de cuentas. Soy dueo de toda palabra que he dicho aqu, incluso las palabras me he lamentado profundamente. Soy fcil de alcanzar y mi verdadero nombre ha sido dado a conocer en varias ocasiones. Soy amigo de varios usuarios aqu. Mi Twitter y Google+ describen ambas mi verdadero nombre, y la mayora de la gente aqu sabe donde trabajo. Si lo desea, con mucho gusto comparto.

T, que utilizara sin irona un trmino como hugbox, est ocupado furiosa por la prdida de su cuenta. Usted necesita los chans, porque no poda soportar conmigo de hombre a hombre. Usted tiene que publicar "Lol U Mad Bro" memes, porque usted no est lo suficientemente maduro para aceptar las crticas constructivas con voz severa.

El resto de la Internet est creciendo de una puta vez. Twitter y Facebook estn difundiendo noticias y ayudar a combatientes de la libertad buscan la democracia. Tambin eran un medio para permitir que el odio se propague, pero estn trabajando para arreglar eso.

 /r/bestof is the money brigade. No one's getting rid of them because they pay for their show which is the sad truth.

I don't think there's a whole lot of proof behind the SRD claims, not saying they don't, but it usually gets thrown in with SRS because some aggravated poster went in there looking for a fight and got trounced. But this usually ignores the quality control the SRD moderators enforce. SRS usually links popular posts in the thousands. SRD is a relatively new addition to the people who complain vocally about SRS. 

But we do have a bunch of instances of guys who claim not to brigade actually do, like /r/kotakuinaction, who went into Planetside's sub and rolled over their community with calls to action no one wanted to hear. Either way, these mythical anti-brigading tools would probably solve a whole bunch or problems. There's a debate to be had about whether these subs help people find new communities as well, but it would also get leveled by ideologues looking to score points. 

The natural flow of Subreddit's can be disrupted by ideologues as well, for instance the Xavier Mendel affair, however this is fundamentally a debate about how one uses Reddit. If I stumble on a niche sub that SRD links to that I would like to contribute later to because I find it intriguing, and there was no other way to find it, then is that finding it naturally or disrupting the flow of Reddit. What is the flow of Reddit? It's eventually going to flow back to subjective terms, but we usually it's common sense to people.

Either way, anti-brigading tools would probably end these debates because the admins don't seem too concerned about addressing the question anymore than the one time they did, which confirmed what everyone knew and wanted to move on from and that's that "that" sub cleaned up their act to the best of their ability.

The best function of SRD is that it serves a bit as a documented history. A lot of those posters are talented recapers who do a great job of keeping the first draft of Reddit's history. There is a function there for that sub beyond "Hey, look at these clowns slap fighting over steak."

Corro cables de red, servidores en rack, analizar los malos errores de espacio de nombres, corregir 500s, reconstruir matrices RAID, y hacer la mierda que hace la verdadera mierda internet - donde las personas se comportan como lo hacen en la vida real.

Su anonimato no te hace fuerte. Te hace mierda dbil. Usted ha decidido sus instintos ms bajos pertenecen en Internet en lugar de su humanidad, y permites que la gente como Ellen Pao y Anita Sarkeesian a tomar la cada para usted. No teme la prdida de la libertad de expresin - temes el requisito de ser un puto persona real en Internet. Tener que escuchar a su oposicin, tratarlos con decencia humana bsica y la compasin y posiblemente cambiar su mente de mierda.

Tienes miedo de rendicin de cuentas. Soy dueo de toda palabra que he dicho aqu, incluso las palabras me he lamentado profundamente. Soy fcil de alcanzar y mi verdadero nombre ha sido dado a conocer en varias ocasiones. Soy amigo de varios usuarios aqu. Mi Twitter y Google+ describen ambas mi verdadero nombre, y la mayora de la gente aqu sabe donde trabajo. Si lo desea, con mucho gusto comparto.

T, que utilizara sin irona un trmino como hugbox, est ocupado furiosa por la prdida de su cuenta. Usted necesita los chans, porque no poda soportar conmigo de hombre a hombre. Usted tiene que publicar "Lol U Mad Bro" memes, porque usted no est lo suficientemente maduro para aceptar las crticas constructivas con voz severa.

El resto de la Internet est creciendo de una puta vez. Twitter y Facebook estn difundiendo noticias y ayudar a combatientes de la libertad buscan la democracia. Tambin eran un medio para permitir que el odio se propague, pero estn trabajando para arreglar eso.

Honestamente, tengo una nueva relacin, un nuevo apartamento que todava necesita un poco de retoque, un trabajo a tiempo completo, y una variedad de actividades recreativas y los compromisos familiares. Tiempo de mierda Internet no est en esa lista. Mis notificaciones telefnicas son una parte integral de mi existencia - no puedo elegir para apagarlos durante tres horas. Conseguir brigaded no me hace llorar, o daar mi autoestima uno puto pice. Es un desperdicio de mi tiempo de mierda sin embargo, y por extrao que, cuando te haces mayor, empiezas a tratarlo ms como el precioso recurso que es, y llorar el tiempo cuando era ms joven que se desperdicia en cosas como una mierda internet.

Ningn adulto vale su sal nunca va a decir - "Me gustara reprim ms homosexuales y las mujeres y los gorditos de / b / cuando era ms joven."

Yo tambin estoy recibiendo hasta el punto en que podra querer tener un hijo, y si ella es una hija, quiero que ella sea capaz de vivir su vida libre de desprecio basado nicamente en el hecho de que ella tiene un par de tetas y que 're capaz de evitar mi retribucin de los padres. Me preocupa qu tipo de internet que estamos dejando atrs, pero lo ms importante, qu clase de gente que estamos dejando atrs. No quiero que mi hija rodeada de gente patticos como usted - la gente que no puede manejar lo ms mnimo de la consternacin sin la construccin de un muro de anonimato y snarking o calumniar en la oscuridad. No temo a su actitud, me temo que su cobarda generalizada, y el barniz pseudo-intelectual que pendejos puse sobre ella - con chorradas como Agenda de Derechos de los Hombres, y Redpilling y igualitarismo y anti-SJW y estos obsesivo puto Gates. Puede haber personas reales con buenas ideas en cada uno de esos grupos, pero usted puede estar seguro como la mierda no es uno de ellos.

As que ahora, se llega a ver la verdadera Internet - lleno de comentarios y el comercio, el discurso y la informacin, la rendicin de cuentas y responsabilidad. Usted puede venir a lo largo de la cogida, o puede ejecutar de nuevo a su hugbox, pero no me eches la culpa cuando el mundo cambia a su alrededor.

Atentamente,

de pollo sin grasa, Adulto. 




 La pldora roja es de 120 mil hombres con estudios universitarios de clase media de ajuste. Si realmente queramos podamos invadir Nueva Zelanda e instalar un nuevo gobierno. Definitivamente tenemos la mano de obra . Hay un montn de veteranos aqu . Adems todo el mundo aqu sabe que la liberacin del cargador est en un M16 , a partir de aos de jugar Call Of Duty.

Siendo realistas la Fuerza de Reaccin Red Pill sera mucho ms eficaz que la media militares del mundo. El ejrcito afgano est jodido en el opio. El ejrcito iraqu no puede incluso hacer saltos . Plus Nueva Zelanda tiene slo 8.000 efectivos militares de la mayora de los cuales son empujadores de papel intiles .

Yo en realidad no apoyo el derrocamiento violento de Nueva Zelanda . Yo slo creo que es un poco una idea divertida Conceptualy .

 The Red Pill is 120 thousand fit college educated middle class men. If we really wanted to we could invade New Zealand and install a new government. We definitely have the manpower. There are plenty of veterans here. Plus everyone here knows where the magazine release is on an M16, from years of playing Call Of Duty.

Realistically the Red Pill Reaction Force would be far more effective than half the world's militaries. The Afghan military is fucked up on opium. The Iraqi army cant even do jumping jacks. Plus New Zealand has only 8 thousand military personnel the majority of whom are useless paper pushers.

I don't actually support the violent overthrow of New Zealand. I just think its kind of a fun idea conceptualy.

 Los cientficos de hoy en da sucumbir a estas tcticas humillantes porque crecieron en el mismo entorno -pussy centrada que hicimos. Ellos simplemente no tienen la fortuna de encontrar la pldora roja como lo hicimos .

La nica esperanza para la sociedad es para inocular los jvenes hoy en contra de las tcticas vergonzosos feministas para que , en el momento en que se conviertan en cientficos y los propios ingenieros de xito , sern totalmente equipadas para hacer frente a este tipo de ataques de carcter.

Ser una batalla luch a travs de mltiples generaciones , y una batalla gan un alma a la vez.

 Ok es Soy yo o es que go-to de la gente pregunta a cualquier otro ateo durante las fiestas ?
"Cmo se celebra la Navidad si usted es un ateo ? "
Me siento como que he tenido que explicar mi amor por la Navidad lejos ms veces de lo que debera necesitar . Me encanta la comida, la msica , las pelculas, las decoraciones , y casi todo lo dems gira en torno a la Navidad tambin. Nostalgia sobrecargue ms o menos.
Sin embargo , la gente siempre consiguen una mirada desconcertada en su cara mientras dicindoles Me gusta estar en contacto con la familia , comer comidas grandes , y dar regalos unos a otros . Porque usted sabe .... ateos no creo en Jess por lo que no deben disfrutar de las mismas cosas que los dems. Adems de que no es como Santa Claus, Rudolph , Frosty , luces , rboles , Solo en casa , pueblos en miniatura con pequeas luces o cualquier otra cosa que me gusta de la Navidad ha nada que ver con la puta chrisitanity

 Reddit es jodidamente muerto en mi mente y este anuncio confirm que para m. Es bastante triste , recuerdo primera visita antes de hacer una cuenta hace unos 9 aos y fue un bastin de conversacin inteligente tecnologa. Pronto Reddit se convirti en un sitio web social, pero mantuvo su independencia de otra inferior alimentar sitios Web 2.0 . Aaron Schwartz est rodando en su tumba en esta basura y el CEO que est instalando la misma.

 MEMES 




 I'm here to trounce on you infant babies who cannot compete with my muscles and combat training. you internet babies. 




 boopy 




 One of my favorite Terrence Blanchard scores. He really has produced a lot of great scores for Spike Lee films as well as a lot of duds. The the theme for the 25th hour exists in a kind of age where you don't hear that kind of lyricism which reminds of George Delarue and Michel Legrand.  




 Undelete usually runs with the SubReddit Cancer crowd. It's basically a sub for people who don't read the side bar. 




 There are a ton of meta sub reddit's but largely the ones that get complained about are ones that usually peak participation around huge drama, corporate changes that affect the whole site, but it largely stays within the house. One of those sub reddits only links to popular posts. I suppose that this would all be solved it the admins would finally release those mythical anti brigading tools because this seems to be the shibboleth that has divided people without much proof other than claims made by people. 

The only people who seem to have real proof of brigading from other subs into their own are the moderators of /r/blackladies who decided to start cataloging it in a seperate sub as a reaction to the policy changes. Otherwise, Subreddit Drama is the most active. And those moderators rigorously enforce their rules. They give no warning, they just ban "popcorn pissers" and that's that. They are constantly reminding folks not to vote or participate in threads. Considering the current drama has raised their subscription base by 20,000 people, they need to remind constantly. Otherwise, I find the claims of brigading usually get upvoted by ideologues on Reddit with no proof and that's very annoying because it should be easy. The claims of Subreddit drama voting are equally fuzzy because , and this seems to be a new claim, that's come up with less proof that there's no enforcement to check possible vote skewing.  

Otherwise, yeah, that poster always seems to have an agenda against subs that are generally progressive. The beauty of Reddit is that it gives power to people to curate whatever kind of sub they want. They can ban whoever they want and delegate whatever they want because the power ultimately lies in the hands of what the moderators want to curate as a community. They're not really beholden to corporate standards.  Complaining about it seems futile unless you can formulate a legit grievance other than "they brigade. I don't have proof, but I know they do."

 Our hive of scum and villainy cannot bask in the glory of homeless man who conceived children after showing his supreme masculinity by fighting vid game big boss.

 Is buttfull stury. He is true vid gamer. Tru. No pathetic  




 Does Reddit have a standing army that he was fighting for? Otherwise this is a private company. And the techno-libertarians don't understand that if Reddit wants to shut down subs then the free market is working.  




 DavidRiess comes in and destroys and the best he can get is a re-statement of the original post.
