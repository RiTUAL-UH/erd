  DRACO

So, these only work on cells containing double-stranded RNA (it has to do with some very specific chemistry), so DNA viruses like HSV would not be affected by DRACO.  That being said, some of the big emerging viruses (SARS, MERS, Influenza, Dengue, etc) are great targets for this, so it definitely has very important uses - just not in the treatment of herpes. 




 I have heard of and read some literature to that effect, yes.  It has been studied, although it isn't my particular field. 




 It is one, but not the only agent which can cause viral meningitis.  Many viruses, through one way or another can cross the BBB, and basically wreak havoc on the brain cells.  It seems largely to be host factors, as in general the virus doesn't really "want" to kill its host. 




 It is dormant (we say "latent") in neurons in the ganglia of the host.  It never really goes away, but stays in these neurons until conditions are right for it to reactivate as Shingles.  Sometimes it is something as simple as the host's immune system being a little too weak, sometimes the immunity you developed from childhood just wanes. 




 Generally this is the case, yes. 




 Yes, it certainly can!  This is largely because steroids can hinder the immune system, and when you do that, all kinds of herpes viruses can reactivate. 




 This virus is entirely unrelated to herpes simplex virus.  Just for starters, HSV is a double-stranded DNA virus, whereas herpangina is cause by coxsackievirus - a single-stranded (+) RNA virus.  To compare it to something you've heard of: this virus is related to poliovirus.

These are not my specialty, though. 




 Keep up with your undergrad science classes.  Try to spend the summer between your junior and senior years doing research as an undergrad.  There are lots of programs, called Research Experience for Undergraduates (REUs) that can give you an idea of what labwork is like.  It is very important to know if you really want this path.

In the fall of your fourth year, start deciding if you want to do graduate work and identify the areas that interest you.  Look into specific departments or programs offered in the big research universities.
 




 It seems to be a kind of booster effect.  With a recent booster, the body is better at keeping the virus dormant.

Using the shingles vaccine has only been in wide practice for the last 10 years or so, though, so we are still learning a lot about its efficacy. 




 So, shingles is the reactivated Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV, causitive agent of chickenpox).  So, I can't catch shingles from your shingles, but I could probably catch chickenpox from your shingles, if I wasn't already immunized against VZV from earlier in life. 




 Redditor for 3 years.

Yep, this one checks out. 




 Figure out if a graduate education is something that you really want to do.  If virology is what you really want, identify some schools with a good reputation for virus work and see if you are interested in those programs. You can even send emails to PIs and ask questions of them, directly, and some will reply. 




 The very first stimulus can be a number of things, including but not limited to:  emotional stress, menses (in women), local sunburn or normal burn, injury, other infection, etc.

It is thought that each of these stimuli triggers the neuron in one way or another, likely through some signal transduction pathway.  The virus appears to be attuned to these as well, and "recognizes" that, due to the insult, it might be an advantageous time to reactivate. 




 That is indeed the generally accepted definition in the field.  The definition of "latency" is currently in a state of flux, and we are trying to come up with something more clear. 




 The "Chromatin Remodellers" which I mention seek to act in just this fashion - perhaps interfering with the enzymes which make a more active or open epigenetic state for the virus, which is essential for reactivation.  




 Look around at some of the graduate schools that have a very good reputation for virology if you are unsure of what precisely interest you, or if you know what specifically interests you, look to specific labs and see how their program works.

I believe that a standard vaccine will likely have a hard time being 100% effective.  I think other options may prove fruitful, however (see top comments for these ideas) 




 Check one of the top comments, I link some Lysine study, and other share their stories, as well! 




 This can and does happen.  It is more likely if the second person is female, but can happen regardless. 




 That is *definitely* one stimulus.

Others include sunburns, other infections, local injury (burn / cut). 




 Exactly, we talk about the virus "wanting" and "realizing" and "acting", but it is more accurate to say, "The virus has evolved to react to X stimulus in Y fashion". 




 PM me or reply right here, buddy.  I can help you out at least a bit.
 




 I like your questions!

i)  I use primary neuronal cells in culture in order to study latency.  Immortalised cells lines aren't great for modelling latency.

ii)  I am not sure about the level of innate immunity with regards to HSV, but I am sure it plays at least some role in controlling the virus.

iii) The primary cultures which I use develop fully-formed axons and network really effectively.

iv)  LATs are the big question - what do they do, how do they do it, etc, etc.  My group is in fact looking directly at the epigenome of latently infected cells, and there are some great stories.  It is clear, for example, that HSV does not control expression through direct methylation of DNA (CpG islands, for instance) but from specific post-translational modification of histone tails!  So, during latency, there is H3K27me3 all over the lytic genes, but more active marks around the LATs.  It has been proposed that the LATs act in some way to direct chromatin remodellers or Polycomb group proteins to epigenetically control the virus.  




 In another thread I mentioned being in attendance at a workshop where issues of latency were discussed with the very top scientists in the field.  The issues were introduced by having each scientist write a question on a 3x5 card and placing it in a hat, and we drew questions and posed them to the group.

Anyway, my boss asked your question!  The general consensus was that all latently infected neurons probably do not die upon reactivation, but we didn't know for sure! 




 It is even more than that:  Of the women who have showed no previous symptoms (i.e., had no idea they were infected), 43% (in this study in Canada) had HSV-1 previously.
 




 I mentioned the link to dementia in another comment somewhere.

And there are definite neurological effects:  viral meningitis is possible (very unlikely, but possible) 




 This kind of depends on what you mean by "cured".  But I have an answer anyway:

Smallpox was "cured" when an effective vaccine was developed and widely distributed.  It is now eradicated in nature and exists only in laboratories (and maybe frozen in some corpses in the arctics). 




 1.  The virus is generally thought to stay in the neuron where it is latent, but a smoldering cell to cell infection is also possible in the ganglia

2.  Auto-innoculation is definitely possible and happens often.

3. It is possible, but there is not much known about genital - oral transmission rates.  Suffice to say it is likely nonzero, though.

4.  HSV and VZV belong to the alphaherpesviruses.  I think what you are looking for, though, is "neurotropic". 




 Did see it;  the virus does not exist outside of the host for very long at all, as it is enveloped.  If it dries out or is treated with alcohol or something it will be dead. 




 I would not worry at all.  The virus you have described has no replication genes, will cause no disease, and likely couldn't infect you unless you injected it directly into your body.

It is now nothing more than a tool for understanding the answer to your question.  It is basically a hammer.  While it is possible to hurt yourself with a hammer, if you use it wisely and correctly, there should be zero issue. 




 A similar drug Valacyclovir works similarly and has similar results, so that is something else to discuss with your doctor. 




 Yeah, I really like the epigenetic remodeller approach as well, and I mentioned it in a couple of other comments.  The fact that there are different, competing techniques really leads me to believe that a lot of good work towards a cure (functional or actual) is on the way. 




 You should be able to find the answer to this elsewhere in the thread.

But, in short, it tricks the virus into using it instead of Guanosine when the virus is replicating its DNA.  This is a problem, because Acyclovir is a chain terminator, and no more bases can be added to the growing chain.  Hence, no more viral DNA replication! 




 Prions just seem to be protein which encourage other proteins to aggregate in a dominant-negative fashion.  I am not well-versed in their biology, so to speak, but I do not consider them living, although I have not looked into the subject thoroughly. 




 if ALL of the neurons harboring virus were destroyed, then yes that would likely cure the infection.

But neurons do not grow back, and it seems technically difficult to target only infected ones.  Plus, you may end up needing to destroy a significant number of them. 




 Such an understanding is exactly what I (and many others) are working on, and I can say with some confidence that we are definitely on the right track.

Some stories I can tell involve signal transduction alerting the neuron, resulting in a remodelling of HSV chromatin into a more active state and then general reactivation followed by the more canonical IE, E, L transcription, but a lot of the research is very new and needs to be further developed before the idea of a complete mechanism is developed. 




 In between you have the virus laying dormant (latent) in the neurons of your body.  It is not entirely well known why the immune system fails to repress the reactivation of the same virus, but some believe that the new infection along the entire dermatome introduces local inflammation leading to the pain from shingles.  It could just be that the antibodies are very old and you need a booster to help stave off shingles, and this is why the chickenpox vaccine has been recommended for people in their 60's (which I would highly recommend). 




 It is possible that you were infected in utero, if your mom was experiencing an infection during pregnancy.  This happens with CMV, another herpes virus, for instance. 




 It is likely a combination of several factors, including:  the strain of HSV, the capability of your immune system, the site of infection, etc.   




 I don't know the answers to all of these things, but I know some of them, but only in a relative sense.

In general, the more protection (barriers and prophylactic medication) is used, the less is the transmission rate, but it will never be zero, unfortunately.

It appears that female genitalia are more likely to become infected during oral sex than male, likely because the epithelial skin of the labia is more conducive to microabrasions than the skin of the penis.  

Bottom line:  there do appear to be differences in the rate of transmission, but it is hard to be absolute about these.  Suffice to say, your risk will never be zero. 




 Possibly.  I know it is also being undertaken as a method for reducing the latent reservoir of HIV. 




 Yeah, you're fine!  Don't worry, there's plenty of herpes questions to go around. 




 First, delivery to these neuronal tissue would likely be done through tissue-specific viral vectors.  Labs in the field have shown that a particular AAV serotype can deliver a transgene to sensory ganglia with 80% efficiency, for example.

Further, once there, it isn't really well known how much of the latent reservoir would be needed to significantly reduce reactivation.  It may prove true that removing even a modest number of latent genomes could tip the scales in favor of the immune system, or other, commensurate treatments.

I am not saying that it will 100% work, as there are still immense theoretical barriers, but I think there is a good enough chance to be excited about it. 




 Unfortunately, I do not know why that would be the case, as that isn't really my field.  But,  I once trained under an amazing ophthalmologist who specializes in viral infections of the eye.  I will ask if such a thing has been observed before and get back to you.  




 This is exactly it.  The VZV virus is latent in a ganglion, and when it reactivates you get shingles on the skin surrounding that dermatome (the area where those nerves go).  Because the nerves start near the spine and go around, that is why it is usually only one side. 




 1.  I think the best answer is that we know some of the receptors that HSV binds to on the cell surface, but not all of them.  Heparan Sulfate, for example, is known to be one HSV receptor.

2.  I answered this elsewhere, but essentially this class of antiviral is a chain-terminator for which the viral polymerase has fairly high affinity, resulting in a retardation of viral DNA replication 




 There is lots and lots of research investigating what triggers herpesviruses coming out of their latent state, but much of it is very technical.

Suffice to say that the virus needs to do all of these things to enter a lytic cycle:

1.  Switch from condensed DNA to more open, active DNA
2.  Stop latent transcription program and start lytic program
3.  Make new virus in the neuron.
4.  Travel to the end of the nerve (axon) and enter the skin cell at the periphery
5.  Start an entire new infection in the skin cell.

And, each of those steps has MANY things going on.  I was at a meeting specifically devoted to studying Latency in HSV-1, HSV-2, and VZV (chickenpox), and there were talks which ran the entire gamut! 




 I have answered #1 a couple of times earlier.

#2 - I am excited about drugs targetting Chromatin Remodellers.  Basically, chromatin is how DNA is compressed down small enough to fit in the nucleus.  And, in order to reactivate, HSV needs to unravel its chromatin in very specific ways.  New drugs are being discovered which prevent these things from happening.  Maybe we can arrange it where the virus is still always in you, but cannot reactivate at all! 




 I have posted an interesting study in another l-lysine thread.  Go have a look! 




 This is very close to true.  I have cited specific figures in other answers, but suffice to say that HSV is a very common and successful human pathogen. 




 Self-innoculation is pretty common, and can occur.  You may show some symptoms, but you could definitely be asymptomatic, as well.  If you already have antibodies from a previous infection, it is less likely that you get infected elsewhere, but is still entirely possible. 




 I have mentioned this elsewhere, but here is a note from a workshop where the investigators looking at developing an HSV vaccine discuss the current state of knowledge, the problems, future goals/solutions, etc.

http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X14000917 




 I really like /u/MentalMarketer 's answer, and can second much of it.

I have known people who did PhD work in virology and then bail to do something else, and I have seen Post-docs join my lab who came from non-virology backgrounds, too.

I agree that it would be easier to do more advanced virology work (Post doc in academia or industry, for example) if your PhD thesis was at least related to virology, but it is not 100% necessary.  In reality, if you do good work as a graduate student and have the applicable skills, most virology labs will insist that they can teach you the virology. 




 Soap will probably not help.  And, bottom line is that condoms will make transmission less likely, but they will not reduce the risk to zero. 




 Acyclovir and Valcyclovir both work in essentially the same way, and I think once I explain their mechanism of action you will feel better.

These drugs are known as nucleoside analogues.  This means that they are VERY closely related to the nucleosides which make up the bases (A, C, G, T) of your DNA and, more importantly, the viral DNA ( in particular, these are analogues of the "G").  But, there is one important difference - when these agents are used, they **completely terminate** the replicating DNA.  Hence, they are "chain terminators".

The reason they are effective antivirals is that the viral protein which replicates DNA is *more efficient* at using the analogue than is your own protein.  So, the virus uses the chain terminator better than you do, basically incorporating a broken part into its DNA, preventing viral replication!

As to side effects, there are always going to be some, but the appear to happen fairly infrequently (1% of patients). 




 The Shingles vaccine is not effective at treating HSV outbreaks, unfotunately.  While VZV and HSV are related, they are different enough that you don't really see protective cross-reactivity between these viruses. 




 I have not personally heard of HSV infection of the retina, but infection of the cornea is a fairly common occurrence (See [Herpes Stromal Keratitis] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpes_of_the_eye)) 




 I was not aware of this particular treatment, but maybe I should have been.  Here's an abstract from 1987!:

A double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial of oral L-lysine monohydrochloride for the prevention and treatment of recurrent herpes simplex (HSV) infection was conducted. The treatment group was given L-Lysine monohydrochloride tablets (1,000 mg L-lysine per dose) 3 times a day for 6 months. A total of 27 (6 male and 21 female) subjects on L-lysine and 25 (6 male and 19 female) subjects on placebo completed the trial. The L-lysine treatment group had an average of 2.4 (p less than 0.05) less HSV infections, symptoms were significantly (p less than 0.05) diminished in severity and healing time was significantly reduced (p less than 0.05). L-Lysine appears to be an effective agent for reduction of occurrence, severity and healing time for recurrent HSV infection.

TL;DR - A 1987 study ([here] (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3115841)) shows that l-lysine appears to be effective. 




 This has been mentioned in a number of the other comments, but it is definitely possible to transmit HSV despite having no symptoms.  This is because it is becoming clear that infected individuals often shed the virus without clinical signs of an outbreak.  Since there is less virus being shed during this time than when there are visible sores, it is less likely to transmit while "dormant" compared to durin an outbreak but it is still possible.

TL;DR -  You most definitely **CAN** transmit the virus even if it appears to be dormant. 




 /u/Felonessthrowaway and /u/ReneeAraneae have great answers to this question. 




 HSV seems to be a reasonable oncolytic agent, likely as effective as poxvirus and adenovirus ones.  It appears to me that depending on the particular cancer, one of these viruses may be the most effective agent to develope/use.  

For gene vectors, I am less sure.  It seems difficult to get transient expression for the life of the host due to the virus' ability to nearly completely shut down its transcriptional profile.

I have not done research on EBV, largely because that is a gammaherpesvirus, and is just very different.  I am not very well versed on EBV's oncogenic capacity, but I know that KSHV is very, very oncogenic. 




 Valtrex for the symptoms is the best thing that I can recommend.  There are a lot of anecdotal treatments like ice cubes or certain foods or whatnot, but I can't say for certain that those work.

 




 IT is largely the strength of the person's immune system.  Also, it is pretty clear that some HSV strains are far more pathenogenic than others.  So, one strain may more effectively go latent after a very modest acute infection - while another strain may cause more damage. 




 There are investigators out there who think that most of the time HSV reactivates and tries to undergo a reproductive cycle, the immune system catches it and everything is fine.

But, sometimes, it appears that the virus overcomes this, and is able to productively infect again.  It may be related to more individual reactivation evens (so, 10 neurons pop off instead of just 1 or 2, for example). 




 You can certainly acquire the virus in the absence of visible outbreaks.  There is always a non-zero risk associated with sexual contact.

I believe that since many people are asymptomatic, and generally handle the infection and outbreak fairly well, that there has not been much of a push to practice safe oral sex.  In fact, oral sex is considered inherently, "safe" - but that is likely not the case. 




 I think the greatest misconception likely involves the social stigma that many associate with HSV infection (1 or 2).

HSV is a very successful pathogen.  As I mentioned in other posts, ~54% of Americans were found to be seropositive for HSV-1, and ~16% for HSV2 (taking 14-49 year olds) in America.  In addition, even taking *only women who have shown no signs of HSV infection, ever*, a study in Canada showed that 45% of the women were HSV-1+, and 2.5% were HSV-2+!

Hence, the virus infects most people, and many of them are not even aware.  There can be complications associated with HSV infection which are pretty unfortunate, but largely the stigma associated with a diagnosis is far out of proportion. 




 I gave another answer similar to this, but yours has an extra element.  I think that reforming the definition of life to include viruses would be a meaningful endeavor.  It would be very tricky, though, as viruses are very different from the other organisms that we classify as "living". 




 There are lots of studies out there with regard to how many people have HSV.  The most recent one performed by the CDC (hence, looking only at Americans) can be seen [here] (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24136792)

TL;DR - using 2005-2010 data for 14-49 year olds, they found that 53.9% were HSV-1 positive, and 15.7% were HSV-2 positive.

I believe that the "most accurate test" that you describe was an Antibody-based Western Blot test (which are pretty expensive).  These do have false-negative rates, but they are fairly low, as the Western Blot is the gold-standard for HSV seropositivity testing. 




 The answer to this question is not entirely understood, but I know the general hypotheses:

1.  The immune system may become better and better at controlling reactivation events over the life of the host.

2.  Reactivating virus may damage the neurons, to the point of reducing the latent reservoir over time.

3.  The virus may become less sensitive to reactivation stimuli over time, possibly due to #2

 




 It is possible that he contracted it from the girl, and it is possible that he had HSV asymptomatically beforehand and he is experiencing a reactivation event.  It is really hard to tell which of these is the case, unfortunately.  I would think that the former would be more likely, but it is near impossible to be certain of such things absent some epidemiological investigation of some kind. 




 This is WAY less of a stretch than you seem to think.  It is very possible to become infected through contact with someone who was shedding asymptomatically. 




 I am on the side of the debate that viruses should be considered living organisms.  There are plenty of higher organisms which require others to reproduce or live (any obligate parasite, really).  In my view, viruses have simply perfected this to the point that some are capable of existing and reproducing despite their modest genetic load.

As for how they came to exist, I believe that very early on, one group of "organisms" came to parasitize another group - taking advantage of the "host's" cellular processes.  When that was enough to reproduce, there was no reason to continue coding for its own versions of these processes.

Here's another wild idea:  what if virus are so ancient that they were a primary evolutionary force in the development of the rest of life, as we know it?  In essence, what if being targetted by one kind of virus versus another lead to the Eukaryote / Bacteria / Archaea split?    




 This is not my area of expertise, but it appears that there is some correlation between particular infectious burdens (IB) and Alzheimer's Disease, including a couple of herpesviruses like HSV and CMV.  [This] (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24910016) recent publication shows such correlation, for example.  The hypothesis is that infection and/or inflammation could be and underlying cause for these kinds of diseases.

However, as many have noted, correlation does not imply causation.  In addition, since seropositivity to these viruses is greater than 90% in the older population, it may be difficult to parse this out in this fashion.

So, for my money, the jury is still out on this question.  But, I am sure more studies are being undertaken, as this is a very important question.

 So, viruses are awesome. They are little bundles of genetic material that only really care about making more little bundles of genetic material - and some of them do it really, really well! Take the herpesviruses, for instance: it has been suggested that this family has existed for over 100 millions years, and different species have evolved to infect most mammals, some fish, and even bivalves. This amazing evolutionary success is likely due to a particular infection strategy: all herpesviruses have an acute (or lytic) infection where they replicate and cause some damage to their host, but they also have a latent infection where they stop replicating, and basically just chill out undetected until they want to wake up again. For my virus, HSV-1 and HSV-2 (and to a lesser extent, the Chickenpox virus, VZV), the infection follows this basic narrative: 

1. The virus infects mucosal epithelial (skin) cells and replicates, destroying the cells and causing lesions. 

2. New virus enters into the nerve endings nearby and travels to the body of the neuron. Here it will become silent, ever waiting until . . . 

3. The virus reactivates! It will replicate in the neuron, travel back to the nerve ending, and re-infect the same site of the initial infection - and then maybe someone else. 

4. Rinse/Repeat! 

With those basics in mind - what have you always wanted to know about Herpes? What about Chickenpox / Shingles? Or about studying them for a living, navigating a Ph.D., giving talks at international meetings, or anything else that comes with the life of a Virologist? AMA!


EDIT:  I had a great time answering questions and discussing aspects of the study of viruses.  I think it is incredibly important for the general population to have a good grasp of the basics of virology, as it is an important research topic that oftentimes feels very intimidating and scary to a layperson, so I am always happy to discuss virology!  I spend a solid three hours answering your questions, and thoroughly enjoyed it!  Thanks to the Mods at /r/Science for the opportunity, and thanks to all of you who showed interest!

EDIT2:  I would also like to point out to other virologists how popular this AMA was, and suggest to them that the readers of /r/Science would likely be interested in their work, as well.  I got questions about HPV, HIV, Chickengunya, Ebola, Flu, and others!  If you are studying a particular virus, consider what you can teach an audience about your pathogen - it benefits everyone!

 Sometimes, I try to figure out my favorite Simpsons' jokes that fit a very narrow description.  One day, I came up with this one:  

What is the best joke in "The Simpsons" where the punchline is only a single word or sound?

Here, I have an album with a few of my suggestions:  http://imgur.com/a/nlNif

(Homer's, "Uhh . . . yeah!" may be stretching the, "One word" rule, but it is close).

Any other submissions? 














 Here's how it happened for me, Patriots fans:

The Broncos win their first two Super Bowls, and I am on cloud nine.  The next few years are kind of a bummer as Elway retires and Terrell Davis suffers an unfortunate injury.  Boo-hoo, I know.  The Rams win the next Super Bowl, and by the time they make it back, it is as gigantic favorites against your home team.  By then, I have grown tired of the "Greatest Show on Turf", I dig that the Pats just sent the Raiders and Steelers home crying, and I just want to see a good, close game.  I didn't really think that the Patriots could win, and when they did I was very happy for them.  Good on ya, Pats!

Then, if you'll remember, you guys missed the playoffs the next year before going on to win two more Super Bowls.  You guys instantly became the thing I was always rooting against:  a dynasty.  I am not happy about dynasties (unless they are Broncos one, obviously).  I hated the Cowboys in the early 90's, and if I would have been conscious in the 80's, I would have hated the 49ers, too.  So, when the Pats became the early 2000's dynasty, and you all felt like they were God's gift to football, they instantly became very easy to hate.  It was part jealousy, 3 SB in 4 years is incredible.  It was part begrudging respect.  And it was part disappointment for not being able to field a team which could contend with you.  That changed soon thereafter.

In 2005, the Broncos gave Bellichick and Brady their first playoff loss, and it was SWEET!  Clearly, the Broncos flubbed the rest of that post-season and were downright mediocre for a long time afterwards, while the Patriots took on a new, more sinister feel.  They set records, and sneered at people while doing it.  They had the gall to try to challenge the '72 Dolphins.  And so forth.  They were so easy to hate.  I am not ashamed to say that your first loss to the Giants was my favorite Super Bowl I have ever seen, except the two won by my Broncos.  And it never changed' the Patriots were always near the top, always contending, while by boys were stagnant.  I hoped that stealing McDaniels from you would help, but he turned out to be a smarmy fratboy who was better at fist-pumping and X's and O's than he was at running a team.  Even through the whole Tebow fiasco it was clear that you were the superior team, and I loved hating you for it, despite how rarely I got to celebrate a win against you.

Now, to the reason that I decided to write this little diatribe.  New England Patriots:  while I may despise the way the media gets all over your genital region, and hate the way some of your fans handle themselves, I have so much damn respect for your organization, win or lose.  You play football the right way, and even though you might be The Evil Empire, I would be proud to have Bellichick as a coach, or Brady as a quarterback.  I feel like Kraft and Bowlen are two of the best owners in sports, and I think their respective records support that opinion. 

Honestly, this QB rivalry is in its winter years.  I don't know how much longer Bellichick will continue coaching, nor how similar our teams will look down the road.  But let me tell you this:  We will play many times in the future, and I hope many of them are on the way to the Lombardi trophy.  Because it is a damn pleasure to be tested by the best franchises this league has to offer.  I am glad that we came out on top this time, but I fully expect that it could be different in the future.

 














 In the first 3 quarters, the Broncos have outscored their opposition in the playoffs 37-3.

Keep on it, Defense.  You guys have played your hearts out.

 All over the place, I am seeing plenty of analysis talking about how the Chargers have a very good chance of the upset, how they are the nightmare match up for the Broncos, how Peyton plays poorly against them, etc, etc.  I think there is a big piece missing from this analysis, and I hope to point it out here.  Largely, I will show how the game in Denver was basically a perfect storm for a Chargers victory, with factors which will likely not be present this weekend.

Let's begin with the premise that the Chargers are the team with less talent.  I think even the most die-hard Chargers fans would agree with that premise.  Of course, this does not mean that the Chargers can't win or wont win, just that talent levels are skewed against them.  So, if that is the case, how do they win?

The answer has already been given, although not in these terms.  When you are the less-talented team, it is to your advantage to do whatever you can to prevent that talent gap from being exploited by the other team.  As such, you want to shorten the game by running the ball and having a high TOP. The Chargers are excellent at this, as we have seen in the two previous meetings.  Unfortunately, this only works if the Chargers score touchdowns, not field goals.  Taking 10 mins off the clock to score 3, only to let Denver score 7 in 3 minutes accomplishes nothing.

Another option is to use non-traditional, low-percentage/high reward play-calling.  We have also seen this (fake punt in game 1).  I would predict a great deal of this coming up.  Expect surprise onsides-kicks, going for it on 4th down (especially in the "Maroon Zone", the area between the 20-40 where distance of the 4th down try may make going for it advantageous), and maybe even a couple trick plays (be on the watchout for Ronnie Brown-led HB Passes, especially).

Finally, another way to shorten the talent gap is to put both teams in a difficult scenario.  The more-talented team is dragged down to the other team's level (or closer to it, at least) in these kinds of scenarios.  Example of this could be inclement weather (very cold, snowy, windy, rainy), very bad officiating going both ways, playing on a short week, etc.  You could also place injuries to key players in this category, if you wanted.

So, let's look at the games vs. the Chargers in greater detail.

Game 1 had the Broncos, relatively healthy and of a bye week.  TOP was dominated by the Chargers, who extended drives with 4th-down conversions, but their first two red-zone trips ended in FG, and a third at the end of the half resulted in a missed FG.  Manning and Co. easily put up 28 points and the Chargers had to play catch-up.

It is clear that in this game, the Chargers failed to abrogate the talent gap.  Their tactics to do so were not effective, and they didn't get any help from the schedule, injuries, referees, or anything else.

By contrast, look at the game in Denver.  Off the bat, there were only 4 days between games for each team.  This clearly helps the less-talented team.  In addition, the Broncos were playing their first game this season w/o Wes Welker, necessitating adjustments for the offense.  Additionally, on defense we were forced to but Kayvon Webster as one of our two cornerbacks.  The Chargers were able to extend drives and score touchdowns, and forced the Denver offense into three straight three-and-outs.  Denver had season lows in both possessions and rushing yards.  This, along with a very timely interception, allowed the Chargers to prevail.

I submit that the game this weekend will more resemble the first game played than the last game:  the Broncos are off a bye, with Welker, and relatively healthy, whereas the Chargers have played recently and are a little banged up (starting Center and RB, esp).  In game, it will be key for Denver to get the Chargers off the field on third downs, especially in the Red Zone.  If the Chargers are forced to kick field goals, they will lose.  Building an early lead, or at least offensive rhythm will go a long way towards keeping the defense rested and keep good flow to the game.  If this is the case, the Broncos should be able to play with the lead and eventually force the Chargers to take additional risks.  At that point, a single play could bury their chances.

tl;dr - The Broncos are the more-talented team and must realize that the Chargers will make a concerted effort to reduce that gap through their preparation and gameplay, in effect replicating the second meeting between the two teams.



 


































 I am lazy, so I was scrolling through Netflix the other day and came across Jumanji. Having not seen it for years, I decided that I could watch it while relaxing on the internet. By the end, I was horrified and confused and disturbed by the power of this game. Not because it can materialize infinite creatures, but because it is basically a time machine a la Primer.

Basic plot: Kids start playing Jumanji game in 1969. Sarah is bad, Alan is worse. 30-ish years later, Judy and Peter start playing. They are a little better, continue through the game. There's monsters and baddies, etc. Game ends. Then what? We are back in 1969. Alan and Sarah are young again, the entire world is exactly as they left it, with one exception: they still have all the knowledge that they acquire in the previous timeline (evidence by the fact that Alan attempts to find Judy and Peter).

This makes Jumanji, the game, a very powerful tool. Imagine being able to continue life over and over again, changing your course each time. All you have to do is start the game with a roll:

Player 1: First roll. Game start. Time-0 established.

Wait X years

Player 2: Throw dice. Game continues

Player 1 and 2: Finish game quickly. If you survive, return to time 0, with all the knowledge of the world acquired since time 0. We know that each new roll will supersede the previous roll, like when Judy rolls the dice to stop Alan from drowning in quicksand. Also, the track is very short, only 30 spaces. Since the average die roll on 2d6 is 7, you should finish in 4 or 5 moves, very easy to do with two people.

We know that things play out essentially the same way the next time through the timeline, because Peter and Judy almost have their parents killed in the same way. And we also know that things can be changed, because Alan's dad is still living in the second timeline. Thus, you are perfectly capable of making lots of money (think Biff in BttF:PII) and / or just trying out a different life.

That game is NUTS. Why did they throw it away?

Edit:  The words of the Jumanji game:

Jumanji:

A game for those who seek to find *a way to leave their world behind*.  You roll the dice to move your token.  Doubles get another turn.  The first to reach the end wins.

Adventurers Beware:
Do not begin unless you intend to finish.  *The exciting consequences of the game* will vanish only when a player has reached Jumanji and called out its name.

(italics mine)

To me, this shows that: 
a).  The game creates and alternate reality.
b).  Finishing the game collapses the alternate reality, returning the players to their state just before the game began.

tl;dr - Jumanji is OP, should not be thrown away.

Attending an REU in Florida in the summer definitely has its benefits.  While we were expected to work hard during the week, the program planned a fair amount of excursions into the surrounding areas.  We went canoeing, took trips to springs and estuaries, and even drove down to the Florida Keyes for a long weekend trip (a future story).  One trip we had planned was for a snorkeling trip off the gulf coast of Florida, a place called Cedar Key.  Unfortunately, the Cedar Key trip overlapped with a very important date:  the midnight release of the final Harry Potter book!

I had already planned (in secret), to head out to the local Walmart with Geode and Browneye, two **huge** Harry Potter fans, in order to get ourselves a copy.  When we learned that the Keys trip would interfere with us, we needed a new plan . . .

 Be me, three days before Cedar Key trip.

 Read details of trip in email from chaperone  drive two hours on day 1, stop at such-and-such hotel, etc. etc.

 Cross reference route with booksellers

 [mfw] (http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Animation3.gif) Walmart *across the street* from our first hotel!

 Inform Geode, Browneye of the plan:  get to hotel ~ 8pm, eat dinner, camp in Walmart to get book @ midnight.

 Theyre in!

  Trip is getting started, we are taking two large passenger vans.

  Beginning of trip uneventful, Browneye lets our plan be known.

 No one else in our van is willing to stay out until midnight at Walmart, but one girls asks Browneye if shell pick her up a copy.

 Pull into Sleep-Easy motel, can spy Walmart across the street.

  Location is your basic hicktown stripmall.  Grocery store, a few restaurants, Walmart, etc.

  Dinner is consumed, Geode and I head to the grocery to get snacks for the night and next day.

 [orw] (http://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/high_five_snl.gif) We find *Harry Potter Cupcakes*, six-pack.

 We figure we have plenty of cupcakes and food, and return to the hotel to show BrownEye our terrific find.

 I am carrying most food, Geode has cupcakes in the see-through tin.

  Knock on Browneyes door.

  Knocking continues after I have stopped.

 Getting faster.

 And closer.

 Could a jackhammer have fallen over in a bowling alley?

  Nope, just Hamhock, stampeding towards us.  It could be me, but I think she is getting heavier.  About one month into our REU, and I dont think Ive seen her do anything exercise excepting the futbol game.

  Hamhock:  Ohmigawd, I thought you guys were going to leave me.  I heard about your Harry Potter plans from Fitgirl.  I wanna come too!  Its been forever since I hung out with you, test_subject9587!

  Fucking Fitgirl.

  Okay, fine, come sit with us.  Whatever.

 Unload the food in Browneyes room and show everyone the cupcakes.  

 Each cupcake has a Harry Potter plastic ring on it, embedded in a thick frosting of two colors (Gold/Crimson for Gryffindor, and Purple/Green for Slytherin).

 Hamhock has to have one now.  Argues, Itll be like pre-gaming the snacks!

  Sure, whatever.  Mention to everyone not to eat the plastic ring.

  Hamhock opines, Ha ha, test_subject9587.  Youre so funny in between bites.

  We decide against eating the rest of the cupcakes, and will bring them to give out to someone else in line.

  Bring a few other snacks too.  I carry some, Hamhock has some, and Browneye and Geode have blankets/pillows.

Head to the Walmart.  Hamhock bringing up the rear.

  Harry Potter line is very short, we are one of the first ten people.  They even have the special edition available!

  We start chatting and munching.  Talk about predictions, which books/movies we liked the best, etc.

  I say, Goblet of Fire was probably my favorite, but that last book sure had a great ending.  Ive got a friend back at school who even thinks that Dumbledore isnt actually dead . . .

  Hamhock slaps my knee and leaves her hand there:  OHMIGHAWD!, ME TOO! See because you never see the body and where did his ring go and why would he say this and R.E.B stands forandDumbledoreisawesomeand . . .

  Tell her to calm down, and scoot out of her meager reach.  She scoots too.

 Geode gives me a queer look.  Kind of like [this] (http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/tumblr_md5h6phUZY1rnvwt1.gif).

  I head off to the bathroom, wander around the store a little after I am done (scoping out movies and videogames and such).

  When I get back, it is only Geode waiting in line; other people have wandered off.

  Geode:  You will not believe what Hamhock just said.

  Let me guess:  Shes hungry, and if off buying deep-fried something?

  No, close though.  She says shes into you.

  [mfw] (http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/NeoNo.gif)



 Why.  **BUT, WHY!!!**

 Geode explains that we got off to a bad start, but since then:  1.  I defended her during soccer game, 2.  She only wanted to watch movie because I would be there, 3. Realized after getting mad that she was fucking it all up, so got much nicer.

 I suspect some new horror is in store, but I am not too troubled.  Afterall, shell get the idea if I make it clear enough.

  Hamhock returns, sits down.  Geode and I have hatched a plan.

  Geode, So, test_subject9587, how is your girlfriends summer internship going?

 Hamhock turns her head way too fast; is clearly taken aback by this.

 test_subject9587 . . . you have a g/f?

 Yes, I explain.

  For the next half hour or so, Hamhock makes vainly subtle attempts to learn as much as she can about my relationship back home.

 Oh, that sounds interesting.  So, what kind of internship is your g/f working at?

 She sounds nice, howd you two meet?

 I am trying to picture what kind of girl would be able to nab you  whats she look like? (**seriously?**)

 I say, Oh, shes pretty nice.  A little shorter than I am, weighs a little more, but pretty athletic.  One time I nailed her in the eye when we were playing racquetball.  It was definitely her fault.

 Oh, so shes one of those exercise is life kind of girls, huh?

 Not sure how to respond to that, change subject.

 Some little kids (maybe 7 and 10 years old?) walk by with their mom, and they are *adorable*.  They are both dressed in robes and have hats and wands.

  I start talking to them about Harry Potter, and ask them if they are excited.  Shocker:  they are.

  I tell them, Well, if it is okay with your mom, we have two extra *Harry Potter Cupcakes*.  Would you like them?

  They look up at their mom, who nods to them and has a very appreciative look in her eye.

 Hamhock:  But, test_subject9587, we dont have those cupcakes anymore.

  Me:  Why not?  I know the answer before I finish my question . . .

  Well, I ate them already.

 [mfw] (http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/dean-what-gif.gif)

 [little girls fw] (http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/unfair.gif)

 [mothers fw] (http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/maad.gif)

 Kids are crying now.  Mother says, Thanks a lot.  And I mumble and embarrassed apology.  They head back to their spot in line.

  I turn to Hamhock, What.  The.  Fuck.  Why did you eat the other cupcakes?  When?

  I ate them on the way over, after you said you were giving them away.

  Yes.  **To other people**.  Not to you.  You already had one.  Then you just scarffed down two more on our way over here?  And then you didnt even tell us?

  I didnt think it was a big deal  . . . my blood sugar was feeling low and I was hungry

  It wouldnt have been a big deal, *if* you had told us.  Then I wouldnt have accidentally tortured an entire family!  And how were you hungry?  We had dinner an hour earlier, and you already had one cupcake!

  Silence.

 She blurts out, Fuck this, I am going back to the room.

 At least five separate children gasp at her outburst.

  Hamhock struggles to her feet and waddles away in huff, without a book.  Everyone in the near vicinity who witnessed the event feels terrible.  Except for Geode, who is smiling.

 Whats so funny?

  I wonder how hot she is for you now . . .

  Get bent, Geode.  Get bent.

tl;dr  I promise cupcakes to pre-teen wizards; Hamplanet has already inhaled them.

Be sure to join me next time as I tell the story about the trip to the Florida Keys, and how three of the girls get a man fired in, Episode V:  Thin Privilege is Enjoying Paradise
 














 Episode I can be found [here] (http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1fh79x/research_experience_for_an_ungulate_or_how_i/) and Episode II [here] (http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1fqn6d/research_experience_for_an_ungulate_episode_ii/).  Also, this story is very movie-centric, and so may contain spoilers for: Fargo, The Departed, and minor spoilers for a couple more.


A few days after the events in Episode II, I was regaling Geode with the story of how Hamhock announced her retirement from the game of pick-up futbol, and she smiled and laughed more than I had ever seen as we both continued eating dinner.  See, at this particular REU, there was something of a campus, where the students lived.  


There were four apartments, a few trailers, and one set of dormitories.  Roomie and I, being the only two guys, were given one of the four apartments, and the girls each got a dorm room to themselves.  The dorms had a common kitchen, and a common entertainment room with a TV, where our apartment had its own kitchen, and also Roomies TV and PS2 in the living room.  Honestly, Roomie and I **really** lucked out.


Geode and I had started hanging out more, and when it came out that we like the same kinds of food, we made it an ongoing plan to cook food together in the apartment kitchen once every few days or so.  This was extremely helpful for her, as she was already getting tired of the dirty dishes, messy counter tops, and food pieces in the communal kitchen.  She also had a sneaking suspicion that Hamhock was taking small portions of food from her, and maybe from everyone.  Also, it is much easier to cook portions for two people than one person for some things.


Later in the evening we were watching a movie from my collection, something with either Alec Baldwin or Mark Walhberg.  Eventually, I said, This movies fine, but if you want to see a *serious* movie with this guy in it, you should watch *The Departed*.  When she said she hadnt seen it, we resolved to watch it sometime over the weekend.  It turned into an event by Friday, as almost no one had seen the flick, and a couple of girls who had wanted to see it again.  One of those girls was Hamhock.  Greentext, go!


Be me, ready to blow some ladies minds with *The Departed*.

Take movie, drink, minor snack from apartment to dorm common room.

Avengers assemble!  It is Geode, Browneye, Footsteps, Hamhock and myself.

Footsteps is a very average-looking girl with brown hair and one of those almost-pretty faces, probably 55, 170lbs.  Her mother is a researcher at the university, and she has always loved helping out in the lab.  Definitely not Hamplanet status, and I don't think I ever heard any Fatty Logic, but maybe a little overweight. 

Browneye and Geode greet me, are excited for the movie.

Hamhock says nothing.  She has two bowls of popcorn, one on the arm of the sofa, one on the coffee table.  Also a bag of chips.

Hamhock looks a little steamed.  Well, maybe not steamed, that would be too healthy.  Deep-fried.

Whatever.  I sit next to Geode and prepare the movie.

itisawesome.mp4

Opening lines from Nicholson moves me from six to midnight.

Hamhock is basically double-fisting chips and popcorn (drink kind, not sex kind).  

Hamhock is the woodchipper, and chip crumbs  / popcorn are poor Steve Buscemi from *Fargo*.

random chattering occurs throughout the movie, but mostly people are paying attention.

Hamhock tromps away to the restroom or something.

I notice that the popcorn and bags are miraculously not empty so I elbow Geode and make a hand motion to them.

[hfw] (http://i.imgur.com/FmwryTi.gif)

She explains, Those are ALL Hamhocks snacks. She made a huge deal about how she wasnt going to share them because she paid for them, and she thinks that someone already ate one of her popcorn bags.

 I bought a pack of eight, and I had one Saturday, two on Monday, and then  . . . etc etc.

Whatever, no big deal.  Hamhock returns, flops back into position, and the force of her sitting down propels a single kernel of popcorn into the air (she must have dropped it somewhere on the couch).

Movie continues, gets to some really good part where Leo is chasing Matt Damon through the streets.

 Browneye says, God, Leo is so hot in this movie!

 I say, Well, obviously!  Hes so attractive that **I** might fuck him!  But seriously, as long as youre not watching *Whats Eating Gilbert Grape*, when is that NOT true? 

At that moment, there is a small gurgling noise, as if a mire somewhere is bubbling up noxious fumes.

Maybe someone in the distance emits a screech, maybe claws draw across a chalkboard.  Maybe fuck yourself.

 Oh, its just Hamhock, working up some angries.

I have misspoken, and Hamhock is pissed.  A central character in *Gilbert Grape* is a morbidly obese woman who cant even leave her house.  Obviously, I intended this comment as a slight against Mrs. *A Fridge Too Far*, here.

She says, Oh, so now youre going to make fun of fat people **and** retarded people, huh?

justajoke.zip

 Well, it isnt even funny.  And why is it Leonardo Dicaprio who is hot?  That kind of physique is only available to like 1% of people, if that.  Its *gen-et-tics* (she enunciates very clearly and slowly, like this is a foreign concept to four biology majors).  And to get it, he had to diet and work out and basically torture/starve himself.  Then people like you call it, attractive, like your opinion in the only one that matters.

  Look Hamhock, says Geode, Were just watching the movie and talking.  No one here is attacking you or anything.  Just relax.  Have some more popcorn.

Possibly the wrong thing to say.

 Hey, Twiggy, I am not taking eating advice from a stick like you.  I am just fine as I am, thank you.  People back at my school LURVE MAH CUHRVES! (okay, maybe she didnt say it *exactly* like that).  And you know what?  This movie sucks anyways because  **LEO DIES AT THE END!!!**

[are you fucking kidding me?] (http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/288/304/2fe.jpg)

Upset with *Forest Gunt* for her ridiculously petty outburst, I say, Well, thanks for ruining the fun.  You sure seem to be good at that.

 Its your fault.  You dont know how hard it is to have bad metabolism genetics, so you go around insulting bigger people like me and Footsteps.

 Footsteps:  Watch your mouth, I aint nearly as big as you, and I dont think he was being mean.  Just trying to be funny.  Like all of us.  God, chill out!

With that, *Assablanca* heaves herself up, knocks the half-eaten bowl of popcorn off of the chair and onto the floor, and leaves for her dorm room.

 Watch another 10 minutes of movie in silence.

 *Apollo 13 Tons* comes out of her room in a huff, takes her snack bowls and chips, and retreats back to her dungeon of shame-eating and self-loathing.

 We vainly attempt to stifle our guffaws until she is gone, but eventually burst out laughing.

 Geode recovers first and deadpans, Does Leo really die at the end?

  Oh, be still my heart . . .

  Finish movie.  *Everyone* dies.

  Browneye is upset with the movie, does not approve.

  Also, pissed that Hamhock fucked up the ending  Browneye was waiting for the Leo kill, and it took her out of the movie.

prettyreasonableopinion.txt

have 10-15 min discussion about the merits of movie.  I love it, so does Geode, with Browneye hating it and Footsteps lukewarm.

 *A Clockwork Orange Chicken Bowl* emerges from her room, still upset.

  I say, Hey, Hamhock, were kinda split on the movie  . . . Did you like it?

  She completely ignores me as she is looking for more food.

 I say, Fine; but you really should come over here and clean up your mess.  This is a communal room, and I have come to understand that this popcorn is ALL YOURS.

 [ofw] (http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Marty-McFly-What.gif) Okay, yeah.  Sorry about that.  I think I over-reacted a little bit.  Ill clean that up once you guys leave.  And, test_subject9587, sorry for exploding on you  I am sure you wouldnt mean to hurt me.

 What new devilry is this?

Hamhock's adventures are not over yet.  Join us next time for *REU:  Episode IV:  Hammy Planet and the Deathly Hollows Cupcakes*, a story of the midnight release of book seven.

tl;dr:  Fatty inhales snacks, flips out, ruins surprise ending to movie as retribution.
 




 Part I of the Hamhock saga can be found [here] (http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1fh79x/research_experience_for_an_ungulate_or_how_i/).

There was only minor fallout from the events dramatized in Episode I.  Since everyone had just met, most people were quick to give the benefit of the doubt to Hamhock and me regarding our exchange at the pizza night.  Basically, the other students in the program didnt want to judge either Hamhock or me too harshly for what they thought was just a misunderstanding (or, at worst, a good ol foot-in-the-mouth kind of thing).  That is, of course, except for Geode.  

A few days after I arrived, I ran into her in the common kitchen, cooking some noodles or something, and I asked her if she was okay after what had happened.  She said that she would be fine, but that she had been thin-shamed by people like Hamhock before, and it was always by a person who turned out to be *very* shitty, so she wasnt holding out hope that Hamhock would just be a benign presence.  She also thanked me for standing up for her, and the resulting conversation established her as the person with whom I was most happy to spend time.

The first couple of weeks of the program move on without a hitch, everyone getting established into their labs and projects.  Then came the fateful afternoon when we learned that the permanent residents of the facility (grad students and some faculty), would get together for a little pick-up futbol (soccer) on Tuesdays.  With that, we engage greentext.

 Be Tuesday.  Spend 8 hours in lab. Email checking at end of day.

 email from another student, says there is futbol game if folk are interested

Be not good at futbol

Decide to go anyway.  What the hell, it is just for fun, right?

Somewhere, there is a rumbling, a massive hungry stomach, a portent of just how un-fun *some people* can make something as casual as a pick-up game of anything.

Head to the field where there is futbol.

  Set-up is low-key.   Some of the grad students are from Europe, Africa, etc.  Point being: they have played futbol often in their youths, they have made small goals out of PVC pipe (think, Hockey or Lacrosse sized), they came to game.

 other students arrive, I shall introduce a couple more here:

Be not BrownEye, an athletic brunette who played futbol in high school.  Kinda fussy and bitchy, but a nice girl overall

Be not YoungGirl, a rising sophomore who somehow managed to get accepted to this program despite having very little experience in biology.  Also a very nice girl, not so into sports, just having fun with new people

 Be not Fitgirl, who just got back from some kind of jog, saw we were up to something, and wanted to join.

 In addition to these folk, there were grad students, a couple of faculty, and some lab techs.  11 folk in total

 uneventeams.sadface

 Oh wait, maybe this bus in the distance will contain a player to join us!

  Wait a second, Jurassic Park ground tremors register in our bones

  The bus is moving too slow.

 Thats no bus.  Its a ~~space station~~ hamplanet.

Hamhock walks up and asks us what we are doing.

[ofw] (http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/bert-n-ernie.gif) Oh, Hamhock, were just getting a futbol game together!

[mfw] (http://i.imgur.com/1LuJmS0.gif) is hear her say, Oh, that sounds fun, I want to play!

 No worries, maybe it is good that she is trying to exercise?

 Maybe she just wants to have fun and bond with others in the program?

 Maybe this will be fine.

[Maybe] (http://i.imgur.com/seh6p.gif)

 Teams are picked, and Hamhock is on my team.

 westillgotthis.pro

The game starts, and I am pretty horrible.  I cant really dribble, I have a hard time guarding the better players, and the ball rarely goes where I want it to when I kick it.  But, I have always been minorly athletic, and begin to turn a figurative corner.

Hamhock slowly jogs in the vicinity of where the ball was less than 15 seconds ago.  She is not fast, she is not coordinated, but if one squints you could convince yourself that she was trying.  I decide against telling her that she should pretend the ball is a cookie or wafer or something.  Also, bonus points for not bitching.  

 This is hard, it is so humid out today!

Well, scratch that I guess.

 One of the better players on my team puts a centering pass about a foot off the ground in front of the goal, and all I have to do it stick my foot out and the ball easily deflects into the goal.

fuckyeah.mp4

Hamhock has gotten tired; she makes no pretenses about vaguely following the ball around.  Now she stands in the middle of the field, walking back and forth about 10 yards, depending on which team has the ball.  She is content simply encouraging her teammates.  Sometimes, if the ball/people happen by her, she will vainly flail the lower half of one of her legs (seemingly chosen at random) until the ball goes away.

  [hfw] (http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/oh-you.gif) one time, the ball ricochets off of her shin, providing her with the delusion that she is helping

 Two goals scored on our team while Hamhock is a glorified cheerleader who is also in the way.

  During a rest timeout, she says, Guys, this isnt fun for me.  I cant run like you can.  It isnt fair!  I should be goalie so I dont have to chase after the ball all the time.

 Say, Dont worry, I am pretty sure you havent chased after the ball yet.

Beady little hamplanet eyes glare at me.  Her face is almost beet red, and she is sweating profusely.

  BrownEye pipes up, Relax.  Hamhock, you can be goalie.  Remember, dont use your hands (house rule we were using due to the small goals), and trying to stay in front of the ball

 Hamhock answers in the snottiest tone, Well, obviously.  Thats helpful.

 Game starts up again, we score a couple of goals, going up 3-2.  Weve got about 10 more minutes.

[mfw] (http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Joel_McHale.gif) Hamhock stops the first shot

 Of course, [this] (http://img.pandawhale.com/63225-if-you-think-this-has-a-happy-ruVi.png)

 The next shot goes in, Hamhock didnt even touch it.  She is frustrated.

  The shot after that she tries to stop by stretching out her gigantic clodhopper, but instead she misses the ball and falls over

  Frustration is increasing

  Next ball is kicked up high. She non-chalantly catches it with her hands.

 [ofw] (http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/bridesmaids.gif) Oh, I am not supposed to do that, huh?

 For brevity, I will omit the other FIVE GOALS scored on her, before the end of the game.

  By then, Hamhock has completely stopped caring, and our team is hopelessly behind.  It is still all for fun and games, though, so only BrownEye is taking it badly.  Muttering things like, Unbelievable, and Seriously? under her breath when Hamhocks latest slight lean to one side fails to prevent another goal.

  Near the very end up the game, BrownEye makes a bad pass, (to this day, she swears it was an accident, but I have my doubts), right to the best player on the other team, about 10-15 feet in front of our goal.

 He has a point blank shot that he puts a little too much leg into.  Meanwhile, Hamhock is LITERALLY ducking, not caring about giving up a goal anymore.

But, because she is ducking, her head is way closer to the ground than the shooter thought it would be.

[ofw] (http://www.gifbin.com/982989) the ball pegs Hamhock right in the fivehead, rebounding up and out into the parking lot, putting her flat on her back and angrier than even that time when they told her she could only have one banana split.

 To be fair, it was easily her best save of the day.

  She is PISSED.  She rolls herself up to her feet and starts screaming, You asshole, whyd you kick it that hard?  Didnt you see I was giving up?  And you! (to BrownEye), did you give it to him on purpose? Are you trying to get me hurt, bitch?

 He says, I didnt know you were going to bend down and try to stop it with your face!  Relax, it was an accident.  It is just how things happen sometime.  If you dont like the risks, then dont play

 BrownEye says that it was just a bad pass, that she was frustrated that they were losing, and made a bad play;  it happens.  No need for name-calling.

Hamhock starts to calm down a little bit and says, This game is stupid, I dont want to play anymore.  You ath-a-le-tic people can play soccer all you want, I am done with this.  I am going to go cook dinner.

 I dont know what made it so funny: the ball off her forehead, the explosion followed by Hamhocks retirement from the game of futbol, or the fact that as she gave her little speech at the end, there were visible imprints from the ball on her forehead.

Hamhock will be back in: Research Experience for an Ungulate,  Part III:  Rotten Hamhock, the Tale of a Spoiling

tl;dr - Hamplanet wishes to join pick-up futbol.  Is terrible, takes ball to face and bitches/moans.
Update:  Episode III is now available [here] (http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1g9xds/research_experience_for_an_ungulate_episode_iii/) 




 Okay, I have been lurking through fps for about a month now, quietly snickering to myself and silently wishing that I had a story to regale all you loveable folk.  Yesterday, I mentioned this sub to an IRL friend and he sent this text later:  This sub is hilarious.  So, are you drafting up a story about Hamhock?.  I immediately felt my pulse race. OH. MY. GOD.  I had forgotten.  I not only had a story (one in particular is the episode that I tell most friends), but a few other isolated incidents.

So first, some background.  About six years ago I was just about to finish my junior year at a small liberal arts college in the midwest.  I was actually pretty skinny and small (59, 140 lbs).  Most of the credit for that goes to a friend who was into lifting weights and running, and one day I asked him if he would buddy with me and teach me things.  Since then, I focused much more on how I ate (got into paleo, although only moderately, because small school cafeteria, read up on the science, worked out, etc).  I had decided to apply for summer undergraduate research in molecular biology (experience in a lab is BIG for applying to graduate school).   We will pick the story up there.  Engage greentext (first time!)

Be me, applying for REU (research experience for undergraduate) programs all over the country.

[mfw] (http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/original.gif) Florida e-mails:  Youre In!  Weve got a roommate set up for you!

 Florida  Iowa (possible oversimplification).

Email roommate, asking what kinds of things he is bringing.

Roomie responds, seems cool.

 I confirm the things he is bringing.  I dont want us both to bring TVs or something. Jokingly, I say, It would be stupid for both of us to bring our rock tumblers to the beach.

Roomie ignores comment, well figure it all out when were showing up.  End communication.

Be next month, on my trip to Florida.

fuckyeah.jpeg

Get picked up at airport by cool old guy.

 [mfw] (http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/what.gif) he tells me he is the MAYOR of the small town where research facility is located 

Hour later, we arrive at facility.  My school is in session until late May.  I am last to arrive.

Just in time for a pizza dinner, get-to-know-the-students kind of thing.  Pizza is laid out on picnic tables.

time2meetpeeps.heregoes

See only one other guy.  Assume it must be Roomie.  He informs me that we are the only two guys.  Among 10 girls.  Is this real life?

 sit down, talking to Roomie, things are warm, happy, sunshine.  Meet the girls.  Sit next to one, I will call her Geode.

Geode is pretty tiny.  53, maybe 110.  Fit-looking, with red/auburn hair.  Very cute.

 Start to feel funny (a bad kind).

 Things feel darker, sadder, less sunshiney

 The joy seems to dissipate, casual chatter becomes strained, and the sun visibly darkens

 Tectonic plates groan, shift, and barely hold

Is this some ominous cloud, a harbinger of the troubles to come?

Well, kind of. But no cloud.  A hamplanet.

 [mfw] (http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/no.gif) behind me, there is a squat, brunette girl built like a bowling ball

  Girl sits down across from me and Geode, next to the Roomie, introduces herself

  She is slightly shorter than I, but at least twice my weight.  I think 55, 280 is probably about right.

  Person-in-charge says, Lets wait until everyone shows up to start the food, well give em five minutes.

  Thank all that is holy that this man didnt physically get between Hammy and the food.

 Seriously?  Just because a couple girls are late I have to sit here starving?  This is bull.

  At this point, girl sits down, clears throat, and spits one of the nastiest loogies I had ever seen (or seen since), over the side of the table, into the grass.

 [ofw] (http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/yuck.gif)  We shall call this planet, Hamhock

  Geode says, Umm, what the hell?

 Oddly, Hamhock is apologetic.  Says, I am not used to being around people who care about stuff like that.

 Geode, Roomie and I look to each other for the meaning of this comment.  We do not find the answers in each others eyes.

weareallgoingtodie.yup

  everyone arrives.  Pizzatime!

 Hamhock grabs half of a pie, folds it over itself, creating some kind of unholy pizza-sandwich, and starts digging in.

[ofw] (http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/imgur_9CUtI.gif)  Its easier to eat this way

 Easier than [what] (http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mend69jUi21rtvqzco1_500.gif)?

 Anyway, we start doing some basic introductions.  The girls are oddly aware of my rock tumbler email.

 Roomie tells me that he wasnt sure if I was serious, thought maybe I was some kind of rock-hound super nerd, so he told all the girls about it.

 Regardless, Geode thought it was funny, and told me she was into rocks, had a geode she brought with her, etc.  Hence, her name.

Hamhock, done with her first half pizza, gets up to scour the boxes for seconds.  I am quite full with my two pieces, and Geode has nibbled away only about half of hers.

  Hamhock returns, and plops several of her folds on the picnic bench.

  This is pretty good pizza, but back home they have better kinds

  Were eating chain pizza.  Well-known chain pizza.  Of course there is better pizza.  Words begin to fail me.

  I say, Yeah, it is alright.  I usually dont eat so much but I had a short connection and missed lunch

 [hwf] (http://25.media.tumblr.com/0c6649ef147636b8d42d00fbf72b4fe8/tumblr_mfr5qk00QA1riiw1do1_250.gif) she is trying to work out if I meant that as an insult (hint:  I didnt)

 Well, test_subject9587, I think that some people dont eat enough.  They starve themselves and try to look all twiggy and they think its pretty. But it isnt pretty, it is sad.  They should just be happy with what they have.  I may not be super-healthy, but I feel good about myself, at least.

 The table realizes that I have said something to set off these interminable whale sounds, which only through retrospect I identify as Fatty Logic

  But next to me, Geode is tearing up.

  I catch her eyes with a slightly quizzical look.  Realization must crawl over my face, because she looks down quickly

 uhoh.mpeg

  Geode stands up and says, It isnt always that simple! in a real shakey voice, and walks away, over to where the dorm rooms are.

hellodarknessmydearfriend.mp3

Hamhock has the nerve to say, What the hell is her problem?

This sets me over the edge a little.  Jimmies, they are a rustlin.

 Are you serious?  Obviously, she has dealt with an eating disorder before.  You cant possibly think it is okay to shout bromides about body image at a table full of girls.  You never know what a person has been through  especially with a group you just met!

  Oh, I guess she is really skinny.  And she wasnt eating much.  How sad.

  [mfw] (http://i.imgur.com/HV7Z3JG.gif) THAT IS NOT THE FUCKING POINT!

   We at the table start to try to convince her to apologize, goes over poorly.

  Well, make test_subject9587 apologize to me first!

 I tell her, I am sorry if you thought I was implying that you ate too much, but I was just describing my own eating habits.  There, happy?

  She grumbles something that cant quite escape the event horizon that is her mouth, and truffle-shuffles off to the dorms, obv carrying her pizza with her.

  Roomie looks at me, Holy shit, man.

  I say, Yeah, 10 girls in forced proximity for a summer in Florida.  Forget TNT, were about to know some *real* drama.

tl;dr - Hamplanet disgusts, shames ex-anorexic girl, feels nothing.

 As the title suggests, some friends and I will be spending about two days traveling the Bourbon Trail.  As of now, the general plan is to arrive on a Thursday night, and then spend all day Friday and Saturday stopping at distilleries and having a great bourbon-fueled time.

Does anybody have any recommendations from their own pilgrimage on the trail?  Something that we absolutely must stop and see?  We are planning to be self-guided and pretty cheap with hotel rooms and car rentals (but not so cheap with the whiskey)

 I am going to try a fish stew tonight, boiling up the heads and fins for a nice stock and then just basically throwing in the things that we got on hand.  So far, I am thinking about tomato, celery, onion, green peppers, maybe sweet potato.  Fish will be bought at a nice local fishmonger, so I can either get the whole animal or some fillets + offal (do they call fish heads/fins/etc offal?).

But, I don't have any specific plans or a recipe.  Does anyone out there?

 Hello, /r/TheSimpsons!

While I plenty enjoy seeing Simpsons images and relevant quotes taking up the majority of this subreddit, I'd also like to see people arguing/discussion/quoting their favorite episodes.  Now, I am aware that plenty of threads exist for that, so I wanted to do something a little bit different.

With March Madness right around the corner, I started thinking about a Simpsons-Themed 64-team tournament.  When I looked into it more, I realized that in three of the show's best seasons, seasons 4-6 (some would say the shows THREE BEST EVER), there are 69 episodes (ha ha, I know).  If you remove Treehouse of Horror episodes, and the two clip shows during those seasons, you get EXACTLY 64!

With that in mind, I plugged all 64 episode names into a bracket generator, randomized the seeding, and BAM:

 Hello everyone!  I have been a Reddit lurker for quite some time now, but have clearly never posted before this time.  My wife-to-be bought be "The Ultimate Bar Book" as a Christmas present, and I am not entirely sure she knew what she was getting into.  Whereas before I was basically a Wine drinker who would stay stocked up on Kahlua and Vodka for White Russians (inspired largely by my love for a certain Coen Bros. film), now I am stocking up a nice bar to try all kinds of things.

So, yesterday I came home with a nice grip of liquor, including a pair of whiskeys which were recommended by those posting in this subreddit:  Maker's Mark and Buffalo Trace.

Yesterday I tried the Maker's Mark clean, and found myself to really like it.  I have yet to try the Buffalo Trace, but I plan to try that in the next couple of days.  Then I want to try tastes of them side-by-side, to see if I can distinguish between them.  Interestingly, I basically grew up in a family that loved to drink Jack Daniels (and sometimes Jim Beam), so I am familiar with the whiskey milieu.  I even got to drink some as a youngster during sporting events (Whenever the Avalanche would score a goal in the Stanley Cup).  So, I am excited to branch out a little more, and try some different things.  I was fortunate enough to try some Pappy Van Winkle 15yr last week when a bunch of coworkers went out to a whiskey bar, and I think that is what finally convinced me that I might like whiskey as an adult (a few years back, I tried some Jack Daniels, and didn't much care for it). 

In the nest week or so, I expect to get a shipment form Amazon containing some Angostura Bitters and cherries, so that I can make some Manhattans and Old Fashioneds.  In the meantime, I just wanted to pop out from lurking, thank the posters in the reddit for good recommendations, and introduce myself.

Thanks again! 
























 When we play the Seahawks in week 3, we will be underdogs (and rightfully so - predict 4.5 points or so).  That being said, the Broncos have the talent and tools to compete and win that game.  Seattle looked strong, but they did not look immortal by any means.   




 They have outtakes, but they call them, "Mulligans". 




 I want to die.

Source:  playing against a buddy who has Harvin, Lynch, and Hauscha. 




 K, FanBro.

Most people sort by new to follow the game.  People don't up vote very long because they are trying to keep up.  Cool your tits.  Fuck the Raiders. 




 I would say 80% hate him, 10% tolerate him, and 10% apologize for him. 




 Well when he tosses their salad and tastes his salty discharge, he'll know. 




 New Glarus?  Ale Asylum? 




 Fair statement.  




 Don't worry, we'll get em week3. 




 I am also playing against Beast Mode right now.  I am 40 points in the hole because my buddy has 3 seahawks.  




 I have redemption rye.

Cannonball comin! 




 All year.  It's what they do.  Remember how long Flacco/Moore was mentioned off hand Last year? 




 Feels bad, right?

Hug it in bros, I live in Madison now.  Feel many of your pains. 




 Is it 1991? 




 Yeah, that was a big win for the Pack. 




 Wow, you're a great human being. 




 That was poor. 




 He does.  He is a mixture of Al Gore ' s boring Ness and Hitler ' s meanness. 




 Yeah, I think so. 
Seems fine.  I'd watch, "Denzel Washington takes names all day". 




 I know right?   NBC cherry picking plays to meet their narrative of, "Wilson is maturing as a passer by getting rid of it quickly" 




 Collinsworth is flabbergasted that an NFL player can run all the way down the field . . . 




 Oh man, I don't know.  I have never seen them out of the Midwest.  




 I love football. 




 We have a superior version called cheese curds.  




 GE, getting weird and awesome on us. 




 I know right?  Leave willy wonka alone. 




 We've always been at war with Eastasia 




 Yeah, that is pretty great. 




 Richard?  Ya dead? 




 Oops, I'm racist. 




 Coooooooooooooooooooooon! 




 Awkward.  Blocked right into it. 




 Yes; for statistical purposes, a gain of 0 for the QB is a sack, and the closest defender gets credit if he runs out of bounds. 




 5 yard penalty; was only 4th and 2. 




 Back to back errors by the Pack. 




 Chipped my tooth on my fork tonight. 

DM; HF. 




 Bad news:  Three of the most improved teams are in the Central. 

Good news:  At least the Avs are one of them.

Starting to get really stoked for hockey! 




 Me too, actually.  I love to hate the Raiders more than the Chiefs and Chargers.  I want our rivals back! 




 Of course you're right.  As a fanbase, the Seattle loss hit us pretty hard.  Many newer fans weren't invested during the 80's blowouts, so Superbowls were fun and games to them.  Seattle taught many of them how horrible "The Big Game" can really be.  Hence, our hatred for Seattle is very fresh in our mind, and I want to destroy them.

That being said - if, by some miracle, Super Bowl 49 features a dominant Seahawks team vs. Derek Carr and the scrappy, surprise Raiders, I will be rooting for the Seahawks to destroy you filthy Raiders *44*-8, leading them to be declared the a new Dynasty, the greatest defense ever, and listening to their fans harp on about how "only the NFC West plays real football" for the next decade.

Any Broncos fan who feels otherwise has simply lost perspective. 




 I think one side is logos, and the other side is colors, right?  Logos are all the same, but half are orange and half are blue? 




 I think it is very reasonable to pick up Bubba (I am yelling in my wife's ear to grab him for her last bench slot right now).  Remember last year when Welker was out with his concussion and Bubba was the best player in the Thursday night loss vs. San Diego?

No reason that kind of thing can't happen again.  

You'd need a pretty deep league (12+ players, and at least 1 flex, maybe two) to give him a serious start those first four weeks, but in later rounds it is hard to see that much upside. 




 Your Montee team should be called, "The Montee Ball Problem".

 




 I came here to say this.  I always thought of Mostromart when seeing the Publix slogan. 




 The herpesvirus family has three groups:  alpha, beta, and gamma.  They are largely classified by the site where they establish a latent infection. 

Alphaherpesviruses are HSV1, HSV2,  and Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV, which causes chickenpox upon initial infection, and shingles upon reactivation later in life).  Site of latency:  neurons.

Betaherpesviruses are things like Cytomegalovirus (CMV), and a few lesser known ones like HHV-6.  They are latent in certain progenitor blood cells.

Gammaherpesviruses are Epstein-Barr Virus, KSHV, and a few others.  They are latent in some immune blood cells.

So: tl; dr --  Related by genetics and similar life cycles, but specific sites of latency and disease states are different. 




 I think you've got it exactly right - the potential for a latent infection poses a real challenge for vaccination.  In addition, these viruses seem to be very good at modulating the immune system just enough to stay under the radar.

That being said, that a vaccination exists for Chicken Pox is encouraging. 




 Also, it was just in /r/ science:

http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/28vuzr/science_ama_series_iama_virologist_who_studies/ 




 Officially it was a Ph.D. In Biomedical Sciences -- Immunology   Microbiology.

Now I am studying a different herpes virus,  CMV, as a Post-doc.  This virus is also mentioned in the article that is posted, so I am planning on giving it a close read tomorrow. 




 Hey there!  I studied hsv-1 for my PhD thesis and did an AMA on /r/askscience.  Lots of great questions asked that day - many about distinguishing hsv 1 and 2. 




 I don't think that's right . . . 




 I am going with "The Montee Ball Problem". 




 This.  My worst fantasy season came with Stafford as my QB.

He'd throw three picks and flirt with a negative point total one week, and then go for 30+ the next week (after I benched him, obviously).

Do not go down the Matt Stafford road.  It is folly. 




 The Montee Ball Problem 




 Juwanaman!!! 




 *sigh* I'd watch it. 




 Man, his cheeks are going to be so warm in December . . . 




 http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/1vdfaa/conference_championship_trash_talk_thr

Comment 6 or so 




 We're you around for the Taylor Swift parody fight between me and a Pats fan in the Championship Trask talk thread?  Seems like it might be up your alley. 




 These are definitely the Raiders.  




 Gotta say, Raiders are looking better than I thought. 

Seattle might actually kill Rodgers on opening night if this o line doesn't improve. 




 Whoo preseason!  I would watch another game too, but the Packers are on local TV so I don't have to hook up a computer. 




 Oh my god, YES! 

Can Phil Simms say more blatantly incorrect things? 




 [NO SPRINGS!] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OO-_LJZbG7E)
 




 Eh, forget my lawyer. 




 Hitler, North Dakota?
 




 I don't think so . . . 




 You mean at the end?  I think Homer told her over the phone that they were going to try one more place, and she decided to show up, too. 




 Yeah, Homer kind of white-washed how sexy that stag party was going to be, but that really isn't that big of a problem - he didn't lie to her about anything.

And, her criticism that he is teaching Bart that it is okay to objectify women is really unfair.  He is just dancing with a stripper - who isn't even partially naked!   




 Keep in mind that sometimes the Broncos can go 5 wide.  

Last year it was usually DT, Decker, Orange, Welker, and Caldwell.  Caldwell caught one of the opening day 7 TDs this way.

A similar 5-wide this year could include any from this group of 6:  DT, Orange, Sanders, Welker, Caldwell, Latimer.

So, he will get some snaps, even without injuries.  There's also the distinct possibility of him spelling DT after one of those long screen plays or some other deep-ball.

Of course, if a WR gets nicked up a bit, it will be much easier for him to get in there. 




 I would like to challenge your interpretation of the ending.

The final scene is Donald Duck, awakening from a nightmare wearing USA-themed pajamas with a *Home, Sweet Home* decoration behind his bed, and a shadow on his wall, seemingly cast by a Nazi heiling (possibly even Hitler).

It is then revealed that the shadow is cast by a novelty Statue of Liberty, upon which Donald hugs and kisses it and says, "Oh boy, am I glad to be a citizen of the United States of America "

So, three things here:  

First, the immense over-the-top patriotism noted both by the pajamas and the statement could easily be interpreted as approaching caricature - suggesting that such high praise for the USA is questionable, at best.

Second, there is the rather obvious observation that the Statue of Liberty casts a shadow image which is indicative of oppression and fascism.  This can be interpreted as a suggestion that even a system supposedly based on liberty could in fact be something else.  I believe if you check some of the leading intellectuals at the time, the idea that "freedom" was just another kind of control, and "tyranny" just another form of freedom was often discussed.

Finally, I consider it important that Donald's statement was in the form of a question.  If you are going for a happy, exclamatory statement about how great the USA is, it removes nothing to have Donald actually state it.  The fact that he asks the question, "Am I glad. . . ?" is telling.

Surface level, sure, it is very, very anti-Nazi.  But isn't there something going on underneath?  I think it is ultimately a cartoon pondering the danger of becoming the evil that you purport to be fighting against, in this case, due to overuse of propaganda, stereotypes, and stolen symbols.

 




 Oh, gotcha.  I was thinking "plot" all the way. 




 Yeah, that's the cat.
 




 This is indeed a disturbing universe. 




 My team's wins don't count, yet.

*YET.* 




 I would've gone with "Poltergeist". 




 Respect.

I mean, hatred too, obviously.

But still respect.

PS:  We're catching you in wins this year! 




 I think he means the weird-looking bespectacled dude with the long straight hair who always gets mustard or soda spilled all over his nice suit, often by J.P. (JG-L's buddy). 




 Happily upvoted a Raiders fan because he is 100% dead-on correct. 




 Be reasonable.  He can't be that awful. 




 Omar had really good coverage on that 3rd down there.  Defense is looking okay so far. 




 See, I like Carroll the least of them.  Sherman is loud and obnoxious, but backs it up so you tip your cap.  Wilson is scrappy and a leader who earned his spot and the Seahawks are riding the boon of paying him pittance for now (ditto *many* others).

Carroll just some failure Jets coach who cheated his way through a college system which rewards renown and flew the coop back to the pros when the writing was on the wall.

Fuck Pete Carroll.  




 Strangely, this is often my thought. 




 I mean, I will still contend that if those teams play 10 games, neither wins 7.  Seahawks won the one they played,  so who cares.

Week three will be horrible and awesome. 




 I mean, sometimes your shit gets tossed.  Happens to all of us.  All you can do is put on the orange, wear it proud, and go after the next trophy even harder. 

 




 Oh!  You mean like a pussy! 




 New strategy discussion: 

Isn't being up 6 better than up 5 or 4?

I mean 5 and 4 are basically no different,  but six means 2 FG ties and even a touchdown forced a make from 33 yards.  Seems like Broncos should go for 2 there. 




 People hate Seattle because they are the new kids on the block and act like they are the fucking 49ers.

Fans and players and coach alike.

I mean, it's fine if you want to act that way, but shit comes around in this league.  




 In "Fuck the Raiders" news:

Seattle ' s third string QB started for you last year.  And he looks bad against other third stringers.

And in related, "Fuck the Steelers" news:  you made him look good. 




 Thompson #40 jersey purchsed.

#notreallybutseriouslyamiright? 




 Yeah, seems dumb, but NFL wants to try it out. 




 Allegedly. 




 Check new rules.

For first 2 preseason games, all PAT will be snapped from 15.  Trial period for possible rule change this offseason. 




 Oh don't get me wrong; I am pissing and moaning at the tv, too, and getting way too riled up insinuating various phallus - pleasing transactions involving referees.

Thing is - we should relax. 




 Most starters should be out now (except for the de facto starters like Kayvon), and I was very pleased with both first team O and D.  I don't think anyone can say that the Broncos didn't show up and go toe to toe with, and likely best, the Superbowl champs.

Way pleased. 




 So here's the deal:  The refs are in their first preseason game too.  It is very fresh in their minds what they need to emphasize and call.  Much of it has been horribly tricky tack and pretty bullshit.   They should tone it down when the games matter, because it just looks stupid when they watch the film and a LB gets called for illegal contact on a 1 second play when the defender MISSES his man. 




 The wife and I just moved to Madison (first week anniversary, woo!).  Any resident Broncos fans or local hangouts?  Probably wont get too excited for the preseason, but I think once the games mean something we would love to meet up! 




 First, it is important to recognize that only certain kinds of viruses can do this.  Let's divide all human viruses into three broad categories:  DNA, RNA, and Retro- viruses.

RNA viruses only ever use RNA as their genetic material.  They will not leave DNA in our genome at all.  Flu, Cold, and the newly popular Chikungunya are a few examples. 

DNA viruses act pretty much like extra, tiny chromosomes, transcribing and replicating in a very similar fashion.  Some of these may have mechanisms for inserting their DNA into the host, but some of that research is still controversial.  Your DNA viruses are things like the herpesviruses,  HPV, Adenovirus and Poxviruses.

The Kings of integration, though, are Retroviruses (HIV being the most well known).  These viruses use RNA as their genetic material, but reverse - transcribe to DNA as an intermediate!  One part of the process involves an enzyme called integrase - it's job is to put the DNA intermediate into the host genome for subsequent activation (leaving it dormant).  Trouble is, sometimes the integration site isn't specific, and you can imagine how inserting Kilobases into a random gene could cause problems.   




 I would agree with you.  Having that line would be akin to Harrison Ford's stupid voice-over chiming in right after the "Like tears in rain" line in *Blade Runner*.

 




 Okay, I'll be there next week. 




 Struggled to come up with Brandon Lloyd, then it clicked with 1:30 left to go!

It was also fortunate that only two receivers who accomplished this feat *before* I was born:  Watson and Taylor.

One is prominently featured in numerous Elway documentaries, and the other is on the ring of fame.

Also, I spelled "Lelie" wrong about four times before I got him. 




 Good point;  we're on Verizon. 




 Will I have a pretty good view from behind my desk? 




 Awesome.  That will be an early visit, as the wife has never had cheese curds.  In fact, I had to explain what they were last week! 




 Standard deal; I understand. 




 Hey folk!

I am moving to Madison in about a week with my wife for a new job, and we are getting all of our Ps and Qs in order for the move (it is non-trivial; we are coming from Florida).

Some of the FAQs which interest me most are a bit outdated due to the nature of the questions, so I thought I would throw out another set of questions.

First, we are probably bailing on Bank of America.  They are fine, but it appears that the closest BoA in in Illinois - and while most of the stuff we would need is very do-able via the internet, it is probably best to be able to visit the bank in person just in case.  So, what kinds of banking / credit unions have impressed you?  We are looking at Chase, US Bank, and a couple credit unions.

Of equal importance - ISPs.  The FAQ in the sidebar is from three years ago, so I wanted a bit of an update.  What is the landscape of ISPs in Madison?  We are in western Madison, out by the Beltline Hwy, if that matters at all.  I know I can google up answers to these things, but I want any personal accounts of how things function for you folk.

Thanks a bunch!


Edit:  One day later and I've gotten a bunch of thought-out, awesome responses.  We've started researching some of the specifics, and you fine folk are definitely making the transition easier.  Many thanks! 




 It is still the same virus, the condition it causes is just called something else (because it has different effects).

Seriously. 




 I loved Tyrone!  In "Elway's Greatest Comebacks", a Steve Sabol film that we had on VHS when I was little, Braxton is featured heavily commenting on the *other* game-winning drive that started on the 2 yard line:

[The Drive II] (http://youtu.be/03pqRihRbMA?t=18m20s) 




 http://youtu.be/NRItYDKSqpQ 




 Fuck you Seahawk!

In all seriousness, it was my very favorite too.  Boomer and TJ, with that iconic music that they would get into:  Duh-duhduh-duuuuuhduhduh-duh-duhduh.  Duh-duh-duhduhduhduhduh-duhduhduhduhduhduh (duh duh duh!)  and so on . . .

We had season tickets through the end of my elementary years into high school, and sometimes I was legitimately disappointed we didn't make it back home in time to see the highlights from a game we just won . . . Maybe even against division rival Seattle (I was at the game where TD got to 2000 against you! )

Just a reality in a non Internet world, I guess. 




 That was fucking awesome.

Prime time.  Prime time.  Prime time. 




 Let the man dance for his fucking record ya cunts, jeez. 




 Yay a first down!

Oh, he fumbled.  




 I KNOW I NEED TO BE LESS LAZY. 




 Good point.

Go fuck yourself. 




 Personal Foul, Taunting, Offense, #87.

100%.  Isn't that so stupid? 




 that was hard.  you could get some kind of flukey magic, a turnover-fest, or lose 9-3 to the chiefs at home.

 




 I like "felipe rios"!

I do "Joe Table" and "Pete Waiter" all the time, but never from english to non-english. 




 i give extra points for the subtle call-back to the original ("run away from the D"). 




 Remember that time when your star receiver said that the solution was to throw him more balls?  And then next week they did and he dropped them all*?

Or how about the time where your running back slipped and hitting the ground caused him to fumble?   The ground.  I mean, it's right there - not moving at all.  maybe protect the rock a little when you're falling down like an asshole.

*hyperbole 




 No chance.  Manning can't win in the cold. 




 Definitely not MLA or Chicago guidelines.
 




 even bronco fans know that a fear of blucifer is healthy and justified. 




 Poncho:  Billy!  You know something.

BIlly:  I'm scared, Poncho.

Poncho:  Bullshit!  You ain't afraid of no man.

Billy:  There's something out there hunting us.  And it ain't no man.



 




 this is going to be like that movie where the creature they made escapes and causes problems. 




 Just shadows on the cave, friend.

Shadows on the cave.

And our horse shadows shall prevail against the bird shadows! 




 They totally should've just cast, "He Hate Me" in that role.  I mean who gives a shit? 




 I think filmmakers get tax credits or something for shooting there.  so, maybe those hollywood types would be a little miffed before just going to Shreveport. 




 okay, you're right.  The steelers were the first team to ever popularize waving around a towel.

Happy now? 




 I mean, they only played 14 games back then.  I bet Goodell would kept the ratio the same (1/8th).

So it's 1.75 games for killing your wife.  He could play in the 4th quarter of game 2, with fresh legs while the defense was all tired out.  Seems fair. 




 richard sherman downvotes comments saying he isn't elite because he disagrees with them, not because they don't add anything to the discussion. 




 hey, seattle!  our game is going to be blown out of proportion, over-analyzed, and made out to determine the best team in the league . . . in week 3.

then we have to let it sink in over a bye week.

yay 




 Let's just hope it isn't like *rocky balboa*:  unnecessary and forgettable. 




 yeah, but that was for another crime, dick! 




 For what it is worth, Vegas has the line at Seahawks (-4.5), and it is getting a lot of action.  In fact, the Broncos (+4.5) is one of the best bets this week, offering only -105.

I think that's interesting.  I would probably take the points. 




 I mean, the Colts went 4/13 on third downs in week 1, so I wouldn't be super concerned about it.  It could just be a small sample size and a bit of a statistical anomaly.  Teams will not usually convert so many 3rd and longs, just on average.

That being said, 3rd down is what makes a good defense great - and the Broncos need to focus on and improve that aspect of their game. 




 Well, Seattle is definitely going to rush the right side of the O-line to go at Clark.  It will be noisy, and he got wrecked in the SB.  So, if he improves at all against the Seahawks, I will count it as a win.  If he doesn't, Peyton may die. 




 At the tackles, specifically.  Up the middle it looks okay. 




 Nah, that's an absurd position to hold.  You don't lose by 35 by "Not showing up".  You probably don't lose by 35 by being outplayed, either.  You lose by 35 by getting outplayed AND by "not showing up".  It is definitely both things together forming a perfect storm of shittiness (or awesomeness, depending on your viewpoint). 




 If Kennan Allen / Eddie Royal have the speed to complete short, quick passes against Sherman, then so does Emmanuel Sanders.

If Antonio Gates can catch three TDs from Phillip Rivers, then "Orange" Julius "Too Strong" Thomas can catch some from PFM.

Oh, and we'll have DT on Maxwell again, the lone bright spot of the Superbowl for our offense.

We'll be fine on offense.  If the defense can keep Seattle less than 40% on third down, I say we win. 




 No kidding.  If one of the beers pulled their sponsorship (or Nike!), you can bet Goodell would be out on his ass before the fucking ink was dry. 




 Currently residing in Madison.  Am aware not everyone has an outrageous northern midwest accent.

But every now and then there's a real doozy. 




 The truth Ertz. 




 Yes!!!  Gif available?  




 See?  I like this guy.  




 No see, bad calls make up 14 points and also playcalling which invites a turnover in the redzone.

Damn refs.  OP. 




 I can change.  You can change.  WE ALL CAN CHANGE!!! 




 Oh man.  That would be sweet. 




 I mean, they still have the Patriots and Bengals from their 1st place finish, then the Steelers and Ravens from the AFC North ( and the Browns sure don't look too shabby either).  And I know the NFC East is kinda the button of a lot of jokes over here, but sometimes those cowboys and Giants teams just decide to show up, and the Indigenous Persons just hung a 40 burger.  And then there is the division which is always a crapshoot (Broncos and Seahawks went 5-1 in their respective divisions last year,  for example).

They will be very fortunate to get to 11-5.  I would take the under. 




 FINALLY!  Someone got it. 




 Fair enough.   




 Was going for the [Ted Nugent band] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damn_Yankees_(band)), but that works, too. 




 You will be missed. 




 This is a non - sore loser, here.  /R/NFL, recognize.  




 I know.  Why cares what sex/gender the prosecutor is? 




 I have more than one female friend that would suck him off at a moment's notice (it came up in conversation,  okay?).  One male friend,  too. (NOT ME).

(Okay, me). 




 I don't think Elway can play an instrument . . . 




 I don't get it. 




 I am having fun making snooty comments all around.  Way fun. 




 Unless proceeded by, " . . . A narcotic." 




 Gruden even called it.  He said any throw needed to be safe.  Boom interception.  




 I think I owe Satan (or some obscure Norse or Egyptian God) for getting Elway.  I am well aware that six thousand things had to go a certain way for Elway to get traded to the Broncos (and not the Niners, Raiders,  etc), and at least one of them was that Irsay was an incompetent boob dealt a shitty situation by a spoiled brat Stanford Boy who wanted to play baseball for the Yankees. 




 Just think about his millions of dollars and your tens of dollars.  That will help. 




 Try out 5.0 yet?  Andrew can be our DM! 




 Ugh. How moist is it? 




 You really should capitalize, "King Neck Beard." 




 Likewise,  friend.

Fuck the Raiders. 




 Let me check . . . Oh.  It seems that Eagles are 2-0.  Oh my.  Colts are 0-2, as well.  Maybe just move on. 

(FYI: Broncos also 2-0) 




 It isn't nearly as bad as folk are making out.  There was a tug on T.Y.'s jersey that sent him to the floor as an interception happened, and then another tug to Shady ' s jersey that was knee - jerk ed as a whorescollar but wasn't.  Two fairly innocuous mistakes (but still mistakes).

But it wasn't any Superbowl 40 or Replacement refs Hail Mary touchdown. 




 Weird grudge to hold.  You stole a team, too. 




 Still better than the 3 point game in hockey. 




 Still stings?

Yeah, 43-8.  I know.

Still stings. 




 Shave head.  Solved.  

Maybe you even pull 9 a Heisenberg. 




 Hahahah.  What a dick.  Love it. 




 I need gif of zoom in on despondent Mr. Neck Beard. 




 Get fucked lady!   Khaki Man just bought yo groceries!!!

You gotta want it. 




 Pretty sure my neighbors think I am insane as I yell, "Sproles is too good . . . SPROLES OP . . . PLEASE NERF SPROLES!!!" As that screen unfolded. 




 "Get a ticket,  and go watch the Eagles play."

I call that for SAS. 




 He needs to tighten has hat. 




 Yeah, well, you know,  it's the Radisson, so it's pretty nice. 




 yeah, that is just inexcusably bad.  We could have had 1 full minute with at least 1 timeout, just in case they score.  Very very bad decisions.  




 I am happy with the win, for many reasons.

First, it is clear to me that absent many, many mental mistakes, this game would not have been nearly as close.  There were multiple 3rd and longs which were converted, and I put some of that on the defensive playcalling.  Malik's roughing was borderline bs, but still inexcusable.  Offside OMFG.  These are mental mistakes, and not deficiencies in scheme or talent.

You like to see the offense be better in the 2nd half, but so many 3 and outs, dropped balls, poor recognition of audibles has really cost us there.

The O line has been very inconsistent.   Sometimes they look dominant, and sometimes they look awful.  Chris Clark in particular had a horrible game.  But  Ball and C.J. ran well today regardless.

These are all fixable problems, and completely reasonable ones to have in games 1 and 2.  In the end, don't complain about 7 point victories where offense, defense, and special teams all play a significant role in the victory.   Go Broncos and Fuck The Raiders. 




 This was indeed poor, poor game management by Fox.   




 This is patently false.

No mere WR foot has a chance against the Manning Fivehead. 




 To be fair, he found out he had diabetes in his last year with us, and really dialed in his health that year. 




 Should I buy a PS4?  Semi-serious question.  I could get Destiny and The Last of Us and be happy for once. 




 I watched that movie on a lark one slow Netflix day, because sometimes things going explodey are fine.

It entertained me.  The main dude is kinda stupid, the acting wasn't any good, and I really didn't understand the alien motivation.  I wont watch it again, but I am not unhappy that I saw it.

Not the most ringing endorsement, perhaps, but better than an actual garbage fire like the most recent Spiderman or, I don't know, Transformers Too-High-A-Number. 




 Just like the wrong two Beatles died.

(credit to George Carlin, also incorrectly dead)
 




 There's no probably about it.

Did you ever hear about the Rolling Stone interview where they asked Steven Tyler what he thought the essence of Rock   Roll was?

"For me, Rock   Roll has always been about 'The Three Ms':  Music, Money, and Mmmmmmmm, Pussy!" 




 And Belcher!  There's plenty of misery to go around. 




 That was Carolina/SF, wasn't it? 




 MASSIVE penalties for the off-hand there, as I think pitchforks count as large weapons. 




 I hope you are right, but I would temper that optimism.  I think it is very possible that Goodell runs the old scapegoat play - if the AP reports that so-and-so *definitely* received a copy of the tape, Goodell could pin it all on this "fall guy" for not making the video the attention of everyone.

Not likely anyone would believe him, but this is a reasonable direction to expect.
 




 My grandfather used to say of Chiefs vs. Raiders, "Let's hope for a 0-0 tie, and they kill each other".  Not a man to mince AFC West hatreds.

I look at it another way:  when I loathe both teams, I just root for horrible things to happen to one or both of them (not injuries - I'm not a monster).  I want blocked field goals as time expires, or fumbles on the opening kickoff of overtime, or hail-mary passes from the 50 that get batted up in the air, and then dropped, only to have PI called so that a FB dive can get stuffed on an untimed down from the 1.  [Muffed punts late in the game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USBAqX8QUEg), [huge blown leads](http://youtu.be/iZxSANhjCag?t=4m2s), [apparent fumbled return TDs foiled at the goal line] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjVNzbQF9jA), holding penalties on a 52-yard FG to win the game, [shanked extra points after a Stanford/Cal-like Hook-and-Ladder touchdown to "tie" the game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTGco82JKHo) - these must be your desires when two despised foes go to battle. 




 China.  Duh.
 




 Not today. 




 And the coach deserves it.  Horrible game management.  




 Exactly.  When a team goes for 2 twice - they did something wrong. 




 I feel like that is a corollary to the YouTube comment rule:

There is no such thing as a youtube comment that is, "too stupid". 




 My first thought too. 




 That is always so awkward - I've been at games where it was clear the right call was against the Broncos' best wishes, but I am just one man - I can't tell every chanting hill person to quit their hollerin'. 




 I like when Boomer does a MNF or playoff baseball.

 




 Solved!  I did this and Chris said that they aren't allowed to do the field-level things this year.  A bummer, but oh well. 




 Good catch - I knew it was a casino, AKA, a place with some of the greatest surveillance on Earth, but mixed up the actual city.   




 I feel that *Joe Dirt* is vastly under-rated by the movie-watching public. 




 Oh, so TMZ can afford to buy the video, but the NFL can't persuade someone to just have access to it? 

You know, for a time-sensitive investigation into one if its players?

I call bullshit.  Most likely it went down like this (dramatized and exaggerated):

NFL: A star player hit his fiancee?  In vegas?  In front of how many cameras?

Video-haver:  Yes.  Many angles.  Elevator and everything.

NFL:  Well, should we see that?

Video-haver:  Probably, but it might cost you.

NFL:  Eh, fuck that - we'll make our decision based on hearsay and conjecture.  Those are *kinds* of evidence. 




 It's the wrong tone.  You do it again, I'll stab you in the face with a soldering iron. 




 So, I have looked all over the official Broncos website; it seems like they have discontinued the field-level highlights with the audio from the radio broadcast, in favor of having individual highlights with Logan's call.

Does anyone know if this is the direction they'll be going in the future for sure?  Are my field-level highlights all gone forever? 




 Manning is definitely not super crisp tonight.  




 It is not cool to just let plays like that go.  Officials you need to pull your heads out of your ass and stop relying on the replay booth to do your goddamn job.  People are going to get hurt chasing down people after a play should have been blown dead. 




 Honestly, I clicked on this expecting much, much worse.  I was actually reasonably impressed, despite the gigantic mistakes made in these arguments.  Obviously, I despise the conceit of framing the question this way in the first place - it puts defenders of Rand on the back foot and loads the deck against them (but, these two people don't care, and even consider it funny).  Interestingly, as others here have said, the contention that Rand is "nonsense" seems to be largely based on a basic misunderstanding:  Klavin believes that Rand is equivocating "altruism" and "selflessness". Klavin believes that the concept of selflessness is essentially impossible, in that one cannot be truly without self (at least, without dying), but altruism is a good, comprising the good feelings that you have when helping people.  The problem is, Rand never equivocates these concepts - she uses "altruism" as the well-understood ethical concept which has been agreed upon, and goes to show precisely how it **requires** selflessness, which is therefore impossible.  She is not equivocating - she is showing the relationship between the two.  Klavan simply misses the connection because his definition of "altruism" almost equates to "kindness", a phenomenon which Rand wrote and analyzed often.

That is why I was more pleased than I thought it would be.  This is a basic misunderstanding which could be rectified.  It isn't someone arguing from ignorance, mispronouncing Rand's name, and talking about how she condones Rape and killing of the poor.

 
























 I think it is fairly absurd that the NIH estimate for number of postdocs working in the US has an error of 15,500 people.  Are you fucking serious? 




 Five will tie; Six is needed to break the record (currently has 503, record is 508).  I would say the SF game has to be the odds on favorite for when the record goes down. 




 I know the season has only been going four weeks and five days, but to the Seahawks O-line, it seems like nine weeks and five days. The first day seemed like a week and the second day seemed like five days and the third day seemed like a week again and the fourth day seemed like eight days and the fifth day you went on a bye week and that seemed just like a day and then you came back and later on the sixth day, in then evening, when we saw each other, that started seeming like two days, so in the evening it seemed like two days spilling over into the next day and that started seeming like four days, so at the end of the sixth day on into the seventh day, it seemed like a total of five days. And the sixth day seemed like a week and a half. I have it written down, but I can show it to you tomorrow if you want to see it.  




 Speaking of the Raiders, I will need you to beat them.  Let me explain.

At the moment, the Raiders have won 4 more games, all-time, than the Broncos (including playoffs).  In five weeks, these teams play each other.  If my math checks out, should the Raiders lose out, and the Broncos win out (until that game), my glorious Broncos will be able to overtake the Raiders for most all-time victories in the AFC West *by beating them*!

I want this very badly. 




 Whoo!  I love color-on-color uniforms!  The Broncos' Blueberries, Ravens' All-Blacks, even the stupid Chiefs All-Reds from MNF!  

I want orange pants for my boys, but will settle living vicariously through other teams until I get them. 




 I think that is a legitimate opinion.  Even an NFC championship outside of the Clink has to make em nervous.

( I feel similarly with Peyton and the Broncs; would rather not play in Cincy, Foxboro. San D would be okay.) 




 Does it say what kind?  We lost Clady to a Lisfranc last year. 




 And also we're not sissies.  




 Yup.  Trent Dilfer revealed [the secret] (http://lightlybuzzed.com/2014/10/06/vine-trent-dilfer-explains-secret-winning-nfl/) yesterday.   




 Particularly when he tries to jump the route and guesses wrong; no DB in the league can recover from something like that. 




 I think it was exactly like this (or very close to it).  Poor communication or missed communication resulted in Thomas and Clady both going in for the block. 




 Yeah, no worries.  For some reason they are very insistant on keeping separate runnings for regular season wins and all-time wins - I guess so you can compare an equal number of games from all teams (hence, why the stats you gave had both teams playing the same number of games).  I have been bitten by that bug before, so I knew to look for it.

Go Broncos and No Go Raiders!  I *really* want to have the pleasure of surpassing them in wins **in person**! 




 This is regular season wins, right?  I think the Raiders still have us in All-Time wins.

Yep:

459-397-11 (Raiders) vs 455-396-10 (Broncos). [Source] (http://www.profootballhof.com/UserFiles/file/W-L-Start-2014.pdf) (I added 3 to Broncos total and 0 to the Raiders total because they suck)

Say what you want about the Raiders ("Fuck the Raiders" is a popular choice), but even as bad as they have been these last 10+ years, they have still won more games that we have.

It looks like we are four games behind the tie, and five games behind taking the lead outright.  Hmm, we play the Raiders in 5 weeks . . .

So, if the Broncos win out and the Raiders lose out, then we could pass them in all-time wins by beating them!

I never knew I wanted this so badly until now!

 




 Very very stupid play from Julius here.  It is right at the border of being legal / illegal (what with the lure part of the rule), but I think it is clear that there was no reason for JT to throw this block - A) Clady is fully capable, B) The play develops way too fast for this to be needed, and C) He either missed his target (more likely) or deliberately tried for the knee (less likely,  I think).

I would doubt any malicious intent, but this was very poor judgment and execution.  It really sucks that the defender was injured here, on what should have been an innocuous play at those positions. 




 I know, right?  Nice manufactured narrative, mediaheads. 




 Ugh, I hate that shit.

And the records!  Just assuming Manning would hit 500, and Brady 50000.  You know people's careers can just end, right?  Holy shit shut up until things actually happen. 




 We have to make different categories for scripted and reality shows, because, "The Swan" actually happened.  




 There are a good number of Pats fans who know their NFL history, know the rulebook, and realize the difference between a lateral (which is intended) and a fumble (which is not) - and they are handling that play well, explaining everything nicely.  Good on ya.

And then there are a lot of Pats fans ignorant of NFL history, who are content to bitch and moan instead of educating themselves.  Read a book.

 




 Take care of this first drive and it is a 10 point game.  That has to be the plan. 




 You're probably about 50% to score from 1 yard out.

50%  7 points = 3.5 expected Value

You're almost100% to get the FG (sorry, Romo).

100%  3 = 3.

3.5  3.  Math says go for it. 




 They did the bye with us.  They have 12 straight weeks of games! 




 That's the spirit, horse-bro!

(I know they are also horses, I guess) 




 Well, Season 4 of *The Wire* is possibly the greatest season of television ever.

 He is also 14/16 on touchbacks. 




 My wife just flipped her shit hearing that.  She said someone would never say that a mother was babysitting her own kid.  




 Truf. 




 AhahahahahahahahahahhahahaHhah!   Matt Flynn looks like Peter Saarsgaard (probably one too many As)!!! 




 But if he kicks another, it is 42-13 (instead of 42-7, maybe) - so the HC can argue they kept it within 4 score on TNF against hated rival GB.

It's what scared shitty coaches do everywhere! 




 Hahahahahahaha. 




 Left out 3 TD,  0 INT.   




 Vikings bad.  Packers better.  Ponder worst. 




 She knew what this was . . . 




 Only out by 5 yards. 




 Booooooo.

I am 30 points in the hole, when Lacy was a non - entity 3/4 weeks.  Whatever.

Still gonna win. 




 I anticipate that some of the games will be good.  There's Pats/Jets next week and Chargers/Broncos week 8.  Probably a few more reasonable ones too.

But, in reality, Thursday games are a travesty.  Nix them altogether and give us two timeslots of December Saturday games after CFB goes into bowl hibernation.

J/K.  Excited about opening up against your boys. 




 So what are the reasonable hopes for good TNF games?  Chargers @ Broncos is week 8 or something.  




 How do you feel now, with this statement committed to Internet permanence - yet with 7 more points?

"Following up on that, why do you say they suck [dick]?"
 




 This was *exactly* was Tebow was like for a population of our fans. 




 Line has crept up to Broncos (-8).  You can be scared if you want, but that is a really strong line.

(FWIW, I think that line is WAY too high.  But, Vegas, etc.) 




 Hating OCs is all the rage these days.  Patriots, you guys, Steelers, hell even some over in /r/denverbroncos are pissed at Gase for his two-tight end heavy game plan (which went to shit when Virgil Green got concussed), and continuing to run the ball.   




 There were a couple of Wild Cat-style plays with Tebow under McD, but you're correct that Tebow didn't start until Stidesville's interim gig. 




 I don't agree that players (or even Belichick) acting like they are above the press is the issue - the issue that Belichick (and other coaches) have always had is with lazy, unoriginal, or goading questions.  These are the real problem - not the press as an institution, but the shitty reporters who are either bad, boring, or intentionally trying to stir up controversy.

I mean, if you just coached or played in a loss, and the reporter asks something like, "Tell me about the inability of your team to pass protect tonight" - *what the fuck are you supposed to say*?  That is such a shitty, lazy question, and it should be treated with as much respect and effort that the interviewer gave to the interviewee. 

That is why I respect Belichick when he goes on one of these broken records - give him (and his players) enough respect to actually ask an insightful question, or be prepared for your bullshit answer. 




 AWW, THAT'S KINDA NICE.  AND MEAN.   




 YES!  I NOTICED THIS AND SPECIFICALLY TOLD MY WIFE THAT FOX JUST FUCKED THE STEELERS!!!!  HAHAHAHAHAHAHA.

THERE'S NOT MUCH YOU AND I CAN AGREE ON, BUT I THINK IT IS SAFE TO SAY WE BOTH HATE THE STEELERS.

 This is exactly what happened with Shanahan in Denver, except the coach only bailed the GM out enough to be AFC West division title competitive. 




 Generally, as an enveloped virus, you're talking 10s of minutes outside of the body. 




 Largely, the thought is that an organized, first world medical system has the appropriate infrastructure and knowledge to prevent any outbreaks of epidemic proportion.   Additionally, the general populace in the US is more trusting of medical personnel and not as prone to superstition as the populace in Western Africa.

That being said, there hasn't really been an Ebola virus epidemic in a place with a very high population density,  so it is not really known if unique challenges will present themselves in that sense.

Regardless, much work is currently underway, and some of it is very promising.  Multiple strategies for treatment and prevention are looking to be very effective,  so I think that it is very likely that even in the case of an Ebola outbreak in the US, it will not be catastrophic.  




 Rise to vote, sir! 




 Tonight my wife asked if the Redskins did the tomahawk chant ( like the Seminole and Braves) and my answer was: "Nah, they're racist enough already". 




 I think 10-6 runs away with the East, and 9-7 could be good enough.  If the Pats are that team, they'd be a tough out in the WC in NE in January. 




 Ditto. 




 Edit:  obv, Ravens fans remember.

 Good conclusion drawn from a large sample size, all of which were from both teams at full strength on neutral fields.  You're doing God's work, sir. 




 What kind of discussion even happens there in that ref huddle?  How do you pick up an offsides call?  There's two refs who are on the line - maybe one of them says everything wad fine?  Wtf wad he looking at, and why is his opinion worth more than the one who threw the flag.  Absolute bullshit.

 Too soon on Vikes. 




 Cowboys.  




 Like *Panic Room*? 




 Was a fumble.   In the scrum they found a Ram had the ball.  Because it was under 2 mins, only the fumbling player can recover the ball and advance it, so they marches it back to the spot of the fumble.

No replay from upstairs.  There should have been? But I don't think there was any clear recovery on camera, so reversal would have been tough. 




 This game was absurd.  




 Ha.  Should a gone down. 




 Idiot announcer.  Time Out means nothing when you run the play clock to 1!

 Also it appears that the Seahawks are better at home.  You know,  like almost every team. 




 You had to imagine that the media would slobber over the Seahawks for making the "tough decision" - and then weave that in to any narrative they could.

It's all b.s.  Seahawks made a mistake and did their best to minimize it.  Now they are under performing and the Rams are playing well. 




 Rams dominating the LOS, plus have quadrupled their sack total for the year.   Also, one sick special teams play. 




 The bears did this once with Devin Hester (because obv he is returning it!).  But, it got called back for a holding. 




 This game is for me.  My second favorite play in the world is the fake direction punt return.  My first is the Utah Pass.

Go Rams, Go! 




 Virologist here, and I just heard a presentation by a gentleman working on Chikungunya (which was great).  I knew the basics before the talk, but was really taken by:  1)  How debilitating the disease can be, 2)  How long symptoms can persist, and 3)  How little we know about it / few treatments we have.

It seems that this most recent outbreak has really swept through the Caribbean, even including Florida. I think it is almost assured to make it to Mexico.  Viruses in the news all the time now . . . 




 Google, "Jameis Winston sexual assault".  There have been numerous investigations (by the press) indicating that FSU and Tallahassee police likely suppressed and possibly outright ignored investigations into a young woman's complaints that Winston sexually assaulted her.   




 Damn straight.  Ditto "Broncos". 




 Umm.  Rapes?  What about the rapes? 




 There seems to be a huge omission in this thread.   People are bringing up stealing soda and maybe signing autographs and being generally stupid ("FUCK HER RIGHT IN THE PUSSY!"), but no one has mentioned that he is very likely a rapist?  Possibly multiple times?  The investigations of which were likely covered up by FSU? It would be very foolish to think that this issues won't resonate with NFL GMs, and it likely causes him to fall in a manner similar to what happened with Aaron Hernandez.  I would be embarrassed if the Broncos drafted him.  

Tl; dr - Likely rapist will be drafted, but later than based on talent alone.

 The game tying goal seemed horribly unlucky, too.  Boo.

Oh well, points are points. GG Leafs. 




 Exactly.  Talk the talk, walk the walk etc.  I mentioned in a comment earlier that these Chargers seem similar to last year's Chiefs, at least with respect to the defense.  

Playing Bortles, Smith, Manuel, and Carr will do that for you.  ( I know Carr lit them up - but doesn't that support my argument? ) 




 I am currently reading a biography of Ramanujan/Hardy called, "The Man Who Knew Infinity."  Totally awesome, and could definitely spark a flame of interest.  




 See, I am the opposite - I think there are places for ties.

Imagine an NFL where there was no overtime at all.  If the game ends in a tie, that's it - tie.  (Obv, postseason would be different.  Since it is so special, I would just go ahead and guarantee one offensive possession per team).

I am just showing the numbers from the years since the realignment, [here] (http://www.pro-football-reference.com/play-index/tgl_finder.cgi?request=1 match=game year_min=2002 year_max=2013 game_type=R playoff_round= game_num_min=0 game_num_max=99 week_num_min=0 week_num_max=99 game_day_of_week= game_time= time_zone= game_location= surface= roof= stadium_id= temperature_gtlt=lt temperature= game_result= overtime=Y league_id= team_id= team_conf_id= team_div_id= opp_id= opp_conf_id= opp_div_id= team_off_scheme= team_def_align= opp_off_scheme= opp_def_align= conference_game= division_game= tm_is_playoff= opp_is_playoff= tm_is_winning= opp_is_winning= tm_scored_first= tm_led= tm_trailed= c1stat= c1comp=eq c1val= c2stat= c2comp=gt c2val= c3stat= c3comp=gt c3val= c4stat= c4comp=gt c4val= order_by=game_date).

Organized for easy viewing:

2012	|22
2011	|13

2004	|12
2003	|23
2002	|25

Would it really be so bad if there were this many ties every year?  Ties wouldn't automatically be de-facto losses because the half-game in the standings would likely compete with several other teams who have tied.  Additionally, it allows for interesting strategic opportunities late in games, deciding whether or not a tie is sufficient, or if you need to go for the win.
 




 The answer:  zero ridiculous, 100 awesome. 




 I want all orange ones.  I fear I shall never get them.

Are orange pants too much to ask for in this life?  ARE THEY!?!??!

 I am not disrespecting the Chargers at all, but their season has a very Chiefsy feel to it so far.  They punched the world champs in the mouth, sure, but their DBs playing well so far?  Palmer, Smith, Manuel (since benched), Carr (who had a career game), Wilson, and Bortles.  It isn't the stretch of 3rd stringers that the Chiefs feasted on to start 9-0 last year, but it does inflate the effectiveness of their defense, which is why DVOA for them places them a little lower than you'd think.

Again, not taking anything away from them, especially since Rivers is the MVP at the quarter pole, but they remain a flawed team.  Maybe Oliver is the solution at RB, but they are still on their 4th center, and as Chargers, are prone to hilarious meltdowns (it's okay, Bolts Fans, we are too, kinda).

They get to be a little scary for now.  But when we punch them in the mouth they'll see that it ain't easy pacing the AFC West.  Then in December, we'll relieve them of that responsibility for good. 




 No worries, man.  Just fuckin' with ya. 




 [Aww, don't be so modest] (http://youtu.be/eF6ZSLDwLhM?t=9s) 




 It is also currently a very small number of plays that have to deal with this rule, so unless it becomes an issue through frequency, or one high-impact play (like the Navarro Bowman rule), I don't think they'll care enough to alter it.

And, with respect to "ball and feet matter", I meant in relation to positioning on the field.  To score touchdowns, or determine field position, or get out of the endzone to avoid a safety, no one cares where your shoulder is - it should be the same for the LoS. 




 [Col. Angus?] (http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=a7a_1349546320)

 I like that all three of your triple-posts have a different amount of down votes.

 We Are 12! 




 I think this rule needs to be changed in the offseason.  There is no other time in football when the position of the body matters at all (it is always feet or ball).  Not to mention shoulders and fingers and such bullshit.

They should change it to either the feet need to be behind the LoS, or the ball **can not** pass the LoS completely (think of the rule for a Safety).  Also, I don't think you should be able to cross the LoS, come back, and then throw it.  Once the runner has passed it, then the play is a running play and any forward pass will be ruled illegal.

It seems to me that in an era of many burgeoning mobile quarterbacks (Wilson, Luck, Kaepernick, Newton, Smith, etc, etc) this rule will be exploited more and more, and I think it is evident that the Seahawks are looking to exploit this rule in plays designed specifically to go right to the edge of what is legal.  Not hating on them for doing it, it is just an observation.

I mean, after all, they can't call it on every play, right?  (/s) 




 Came for the AFC West showdown.     I hope whoever loses does so in a heartbreaking fashion. 




 I saw one that said:

**C**ard

**B**oard

**S**ign

That's pretty okay. 




 5 minute drill time - Jets' O never touchew the ball again. 




 Very poor execution this half.  Better step it UP D. 




 I heard, "IT'S TOO EASY!!!"  Awesome either way. 




 That catch was actually absurd. 




 Graphic shows Manning as a Bronco, but not Favre as a Viking.  Just inconsistent and a little funny. 




 It is known. 




 Exactly.  Then, he called him Julius five seconds later while watching the same replay. 




 Dan Fouts.  Usually he is merely annoying, but today he is absolutely intolerable.  Also, he's saying blatantly incorrect things.  On that TD, he said two blatantly false things,  and mixed up the Thomases. 




 Very simple, actually:  Denver o line is under performing something awful.  Absolutely sabotaging the entire offense.  D lost trevethan, but is playing well. 




 Better than all. 




 Yeah, they are being really shitty.

 Fair enough, thanks for the perspective.  I hate the Dodgers, too. 




 Yeah, thanks; I just saw that one.  It confused me because the post title is kind of backwards, and it wasn't the bleacher video that you posted. 




 Gonna give my two cents here.

1.  Apparently if Kronke move the Rams, he wants to be the only NFL franchise in LA - he will not want the Chargers or Raiders to join him there.  If he is truly adamant about this, I could see the league disallowing the Rams' move to LA, in favor of the AFCW teams.

2.  As for Davis' contention that he will swap to the NFC - that seems very odd to me.  There is such a rich tradition of the Raiders in the AFL and then AFC that I am hesitant to believe that this is anything more than a bargaining chip to get a new stadium for the Raiders.  I mean, Al Davis practically built the AFC, helped with the merger, etc.  To be fair, though, the Raiders have been awful and have a terrible culture of losing in the last decade+, it may be that Mark Davis wants a fresh start, and that could include the realignment.

3.  The Chargers 100% should move.  I get the feeling that a majority of their fan base is in he greater LA area anyway, and I don't think the San Diego die-hards (of which there are some) would completely bail on the franchise if it moved a little north. 

4.  Obviously, if the Raiders bail, we get Seattle back.  The Raiders are far more hated as rivals, and it would suck to lose them, but Seattle is a nice consolation prize.  Battling them twice a year would be fun.

5.  If I was given God Powers, I would prefer that the Rams move, Kronke swallows his pride and allows the Chargers to go with him, and the Raiders get a new stadium in the Bay Area.  Additionally, the 49ers become the "Santa Clara 49ers".

tl;dr - Kronke's stubbornness is big, San D and Oakland both need stadiums, and while losing the Raiders as division rivals would suck, Seattle would be a great rival, too. 

edit:  also, you should x-post this to /r/nfl. 




 A fair point, and I don't often pay attention to contract deals and such from other teams - but how many non-max extensions of rookie contracts under the new CBA have happened?  It seems like a small sample size. 




 Yeah, I know.  You guys fucking pummeled us for like 15 straight years until we became relevant in '77.  The wikipedia article on [our rivalry] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broncos%E2%80%93Raiders_rivalry) is actually put together really well.

In the 60's and 70's, you assholes were 29-10-2 against us.  Fucking brutal. 

 




 The stories that I saw mentioned that the language in the new CBA with regards to non-max contract extensions on rookie deals was very, very vague.  So, most likely what happened was they put together a deal that they thought was fine, but the vagaries of the CBA made it not okay, so they had to adjust it.  I wouldn't say that Connely "screwed up" - it was more like trying to get the right form through a government bureaucracy - and filled out flawlessly, to boot. 




 I say this.  All.  The.  Time.  My wife still doesn't understand.  




 Oh, I am not saying that he can't get 6 TDs and take the record outright this week - just that it is most likely to happen vs. The Santa Clara 49ers.  I'd put it at something like:

5%  Jets

60% 49ers

30% Chargers

5% Patriots or Later 




 Yeah, they would really love that.  I already heard Nantz/Simms talk about it once. 
























 Minor pet peeve of mine:  "enemy" is a term of war, or battle, whereas "friend" refers to a social relationship.  This phrase is more powerful (and conveys the sentiment better) if altered slightly:

"The enemy of my enemy is my *ally*."

Not being a dick, just putting the idea out there; do what you like!

Fuck the Raiders. 




 /r/theydidthemath  




 Chris Harris III incoming? 




 In the post-game presser Fox said that Rahim was just very fired up, yelling, "That's why you drafted me!"  Fox said that it was all very positive, just lots of emotion after a big play.

Recall that Rahim almost lost his leg last year, and could have died. 




 Not the 10 hr version.  Downvote!

(Not really!  Good on ya.  Go Avs) 




 I approve this message.  




 If it makes you feel any better, this is how I approached every game in the late 2000's against you assholes.  I just knew LT or Sproles would score 5 touchdowns or something.  And they always did. 




 Agree.  Let's never say salty again.   Every movement starts with a single idea! 

 




 Totally right.  Football in the new era is getting to the dance,  then playing your best 3-4 games there.  If we play like the SF, SD, or IND games in the playoffs, we have a good chance.   If we play the SEA or NYJ games, not so much.  It is true for every other team in the league, too.  But I think that the Broncos have a greater margin for error than almost every other team, and that feels good (for example, both the D and O can carry us if one falters).

GG.  Fuck the Raiders.  




 Are you sure?  Are there any Cardinals players who have an opinion? 




 Ugh.  No kidding. 




 Oh yeah, that's the good stuff! 




 They clearly have a QB package.  Heard Romo and Elway. 




 Nobody forgets monkey riding a dog. 




 Ha-*ha!* 




 **Hate** bullshit calls like that taking away great plays.  Boo. 




 False.  NE and KC and SD away are rough.  Cincinnati too.   




 Nobody knows anything until Phil Simms explains it. 




 Juwana-Man trucking. 




 Yeah.  #54.  Here's a helpful guide as his twitter pic: [ pic] (https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/514594308352385027/l_2ixyDj.jpeg) 




 Groovy.  Thanks. 




 You are cool. 




 Not a Chargers historian - which of your # are retired, and I am guessing his will be once he gets the HOF? 




 Chargers fans:  LT celebration okay?

Homage or being a dick? 




 Umm.  Thanks,  Carey.  Awkward as fuck here. 




 Ro-mo.  Ro-mo. 




 Nah, watch this horsemeat commercial. 




 Still might . . . And give a first down to the Chargers from the flag.  This could be more supreme stupid from Malik. 




 I think this may have been the initial pitch. 




 Own.  That. Shit.  It is *your* sandwich,  too. 




 "Okay, guys, we have reached our allotted amount of rapes and beatings.  Tone it down." 




 Are you sure? 




 Everyone watches *Two Broke Girls*, *The Big Bang Theory*, *Two and a Half Men*, *Elementary*, and millions of CSI/NCIS iterations.  Everybody. 




 You are correct. 




 Most folk in these parts think he will play out his full 5 yr contract (so, two more years after this one).  Seems possible if the injury bug stays away.  He isn't exactly getting worse. 




 On purpose, tighter is safer. 




 Yeah, but *he'd* know. 




 I'd answer, but I am technically at risk for alcoholism,  so . . .  




 Other Manning and Romo? 




 Saving them for the second half, I bet. 




 Clearly ran 5 yards. 




 Solid 2 min drill here.  Looks like we will get points w/o giving Rivers a shot.

Obv no turnover etc 




 Carter *also* bit on the short route.  Who cares if he catches it 10 yards short? 




 Yeah, me too.   




 No way Q.Carter belongs on Gates. I get the plan, coaches, but he has failed.  Move on to something else, jeez. 




 No arguments here, but in a game thread? 




 Von Miller is our dreams. 




 He posted a bunch of testimonials regarding the sexual assault allegations.  Like LOTS of them. 




 I approve this message.  *The Catch* is legendary. 

It'd be like comparing any 98 yard drive to *The Drive*. 




 I think it is the Donahue (sp?) Interview. 

If not that, the black and white one with Mike Wallace. 




 Lost to the Ravens -- Acknowledge. 

Beat Chargers and Patriots -- Ignore.

Lose to Seahawks -- Acknowledge. 


ETC ETC.

DITCH this shit. 




 Until very recently, this was the Broncos' *m.o.* as well - collapses from frontrunner to missing the playoffs basically got Shanahan fired and destroyed any chance McDaniels had to continue as our coach. 




 Yeah, I can't wait (but I am going to, because there's lots more football to be excited about!) 




 I think it is because ARI still plays SF once (and beat them earlier!) and SEA twice.  So, those games have a much greater effect on the implications than does this one.  Even if PHI wins, ARI is still in 1st place with an inside track, and conversely, if ARI wins, they can still shit the bed in their division games. 




 I mean that you have more security with Bitcoin because your identity is not automatically attached to your transactions.  I agree that there is greater responsibility to take care of your keys, devices,  etc with Bitcoin, but the benefits lay in divorcing your personal information from your purchasing power, and I think that is worth the increase in personal responsibility.  




 Totally agree.  My go-to "elevator" explanation is this:

1.  Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer digital currency which is traded through a *network*.  (People understand "peer-to-peer" from Napster, and most have a reasonable concept of a "network").

2.  Just like banks/companies/families have a ledger/transaction balance/checkbook - so does the Bitcoin network.  But, it is public, and everyone in the network has a copy.  (Likewise, people understand a "ledger" - making the jump from a pen-and-paper ledger to a digital, decentralized on is certainly a leap, but you can help facilitate that leap by introducing that concept early)

3.  Mention the "headline" benefits (no 3rd party, personal security, etc.)  (Get 'em excited!)

**Then**, if they are interested, we can talk about the blockchain, mining, SHA256, etc, etc.  But don't load people up with that up front - they'll get scared. 




 Yeah, that is a major early misconception (one which I had, as well).  And you can tell that the gentleman was thinking along those very lines when he asked, "And that's for *one* Bitcoin?" 




 This was a very valiant effort for morning news/talk TV.  Important points were made, there was some fogginess on the details (I don't think she really understands where bitcoins come from or what they *are*), but overall this was way better than I had anticipated.

If segments like these cause just 1 in 100 people to give bitcoin a serious investigation, then they deserve praise. 




 Good job, ungulate bro!

*hoof bump*
 




 Wait, I was watching that game, what was so egregious? 

ninja edit:  The offensive P.I.? 




 This is a legitimate complaint.  Honest assessment of your record / division standing after those 6 games you mention (i.e., before finishing up the division slate)? 




 But it was to the Rams/Seahawks game - where you got to watch the Fail Mary beneficiaries get Special Teamsed to death. 









 Still beat the Steelers.  You're probably gonna be the game that keeps them out of the playoffs.
 




 I read that as "Food Loin" every single time.

You know, like a loin of food? 




 JJ Watt is a just a shared hallucination of the entire human race. 




 Through the first seven weeks, I think we are getting a much better picture of how this season is going to play out.  And let me tell you a secret: it is going to be **AWESOME**.

We are looking at absolute dogfights in the AFC West, AFC North, NFC East, NFC North, and NFC West, with at least four legitimately strong Wild Card teams in each conference.  Do not be surprised if a 10-6 team whiffs again this year (like last year's Cards).

And then, the playoffs will get going.  Since opening up the year slowly, the Colts, Broncos, Ravens, Patriots, and Chargers look *really* strong.  Add in a dark horse like the Bengals (who have fallen off of late) and the Chiefs or Texans and you've got some great playoff football brewing.

And the NFC won't disappoint either!  Cowboys and Eagles still have 2 games against each other, but are otherwise X-1.  Packers and Lions are X-2, and have looked unstoppable at times.  The West is going to be absurd unless Seattle falls off the map, as the top 3 teams still have 5 games between them (Arizona has the lone win, so far).  The possible playoff matchups here are also very intriguing.

tl;dr - As we approach the midway point, this year's playoff push looks to be thoroughly entertaining - and the playoffs themselves will be even better. 




 Actual line from that movie (when Will and Shawn (Sean?  w/e) are parting ways, and hugging:

 Will:  Does this violate the doctor/patient relationship?
 
 Sean:  Only if you grab my ass.

A fine joke, reasonable, not even too dirty with only one possible bad word.

The TV "censored" version:

 Will:  Does this violate the doctor/patient relationship?
 
 Sean:  Only if you turn around.

Isn't buttsex dirtier than ass-grabbing?  TV is weird. 




 PFM said they installed the fake screen to DT -- Welker Go route on Friday, too.

DO YOU SEE WHAT YOUR THURSDAY GAMES ROB US OF, GOODELL?  DO YOU SEE!?!?!? 




 0/ 




 We scrong, then. 




 Oh man, it is Chargers week!  Time to pull out the Cryin' Ryan youtubes! 




 Did you cringe when the announcer on Sat. night said, "When I look at him [Winston], I just keep seeing Big Ben!"

Because my wife and I did. 




 Check out [fivethirtyeight](http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/nfl-week-6-elo-ratings-and-playoff-odds/), they do a weekly "Playoff Odds" calculation and often mention the possibility of a team going winless.  I have linked to week 6, where the Raiders were predicted to go winless in 11% of the simulations - the Jaguars, the other winless team at the time, went winless in 7% of the simulations.  

So, to answer your question, I would guess that the number is slightly higher than 11% - so probably better than 1-in-9. 




 Stupid Thursday games. If you'll recall, this happened last year to us (Welker had his concussion the Sunday before and obviously couldn't play on Thursday). 




 Also /r/dataisbeautiful would eat this up. 




 First he was stream - of - consciousness dreaming about Andrew Luck getting traded to the Broncos in 2030 and beating Peyton ' s record.  Then Collinsworth said they'd be at home for it.  And Al said they be *in* the home, and then said maybe in the casket.

No verbatim 




 Jokingly referred to his own demise on national tv.  

Bad juju. 




 Al Michaels ' daydreams are awesome. 




  Quick!!! Camera on Peyton! 




 Ha!  Go Cardinals! 




 Raiders could be the last winless team.

Oh, wait . . .  




 Relevant:  Luck has played one more game.

Your point stands.  Talk to a Texans fan about Colts and QBs. 




 Very possible.  One NFCE team will be good, one NFCN team, too.  2nd and 3rd in the West have to compete with them.  Will be dicey.

For WC, obv. 




 How many times are they going to let the right tackle move early? 




 Eagles are a reasonable answer, but I would give it to Dallas. 




 And of the 6 games between those 3, only 1 has been played so far (Cards beat 9ers).  Then, we learned the Rams can show up, too.  That division race is going to be awesome to watch. 




 Change hands! !!! 




 And we spotted 'em one incompletion. 




 Me too. 




 Yeah, he really does. 




 Possible but very unlikely.  Him sitting out his first 3-4 years, plus injury last year make it a longshot. 




 Broncos won toss and deferred. 




 The bad CB blitz on 3rd and 17 was a more likely culprit. Boo. 




 Pot Roast with the record.

Calling it. 




 Hahaha.  Harbaugh is awful.  Even if he wins this challenge (50/50), he just moves the Broncos back 15-20 yards.   Still 1st down and 10 to go.  Is your time out worth that little?  What will Kaepernick do the next time he can't snap the ball in time? 




 WR in high school. 




 John Fox ' s Review Coach has the responsibility to call down to him there. 




 Which animal? 




 Easy call, his arm with the ball hits the pylon. 




 Kick never had a chance. 




 Happy with how this game is playing out.  Just like last week, a division foe is going to lose in heartbreaking fashion. 




 Sick Gaines, bro. 




 I think that was a poor challenge anyway.  Chargers still go on 4th there. 




 A. Sherman is best Sherman. 
























 Significant losses on multiple screens. 




 An honest question here:  has this gentleman even read the Satoshi paper? His argument takes the following form:

1.  Bitcoin's value is dependent on the existence of a number of its features, especially the integrity of the "miners".

2.  "Mining" inherently trends towards monopoly.

3.  A mining pool which has become a monopoly nullifies the key features of Bitcoin.

4.  Therefore, Bitcoin is inherently flawed and doomed.

Even granting him that his first two propositions are true (which can be argued, but to Hell with it, I'll be generous and give him those), his conclusion (#3, and thus #4) does not follow, because a 51% attack does not create the problem that he thinks it does.

In the Satoshi paper, there is a mention of a 51% attack problem, and it clearly shows how the incentives for the system make it economically infeasible to apply your mining power to a 51% attack - the system is such that applying that power to the network honestly would get you a greater reward.  The only thing that a 51% attack can do is shut down (or delay) the system until the other actors discover what is going on.  Hence, a 51% attack can, at most, maliciously attempt to destroy the functionality of the system - but it would not hinder it for long, *for multiple reasons*.

First, these gigantic mining pools generally contain many individual miners.  Once they realize that them being part of this pool has hampered the system, their incentive for remaining in the pool is gone (they are getting a return of exactly zero - even hashing by hand is better than that!) Second, even if (somehow) this really is one single, gigantic, malevolent actor using all the mining power for evil, all we need to do is alter the Bitcoin protocol enough to make his ASICs obsolete.  Then, all that money was wasted building and maintaining ASICs that are now built for a slightly-different task, and the Blockchain goes back to the longest "good" chain and re-starts, albeit with much less mining power.  But - the wealth (the coins) are still there.

tl;dr - This argument is based on one incorrect assumption:  that a 51% attack can disrupt the Bitcoin network permanently by stealing coins. 




 It.  Does not.  Make. Sense. 




 Using [win %] (http://espn.go.com/nfl/playoffs/machine?2014) as the automatic determining factor for the rest of the season is absolutely stupid for the following reasons:

1.  It biases towards teams with already good win percentages.  As such, the Cardinals and Patriots don't lose another game, and several teams do not win another game.

2.  It has no tiebreaking procedure, so from week 12 to week 17, this simulation predicts 16 games will end in a tie.

 




 Right but this way *they* get the HC that *we* kicked out of town early who then went to become a coordinator in the NFC West. 




 The very best solution, in my mind, is to move away from conference-based playoffs to a full seeded system, still with 12 teams.  The 8 division winners can still all have invites, but will be seeded according to their records.  It ends up looking like this:

Four Teams with best records (regardless of Division Championship) - 1st Round Bye.

Four next best records:  1st Round home game

Four worst records; 1st Round road game.

Let's take the infamous 7-9 Seahawks year into account.  Here were the seeds for that year:

 Rank | AFC Team (Rec) |  NFC Team (Rec) 
---|---|----
1 | New England (14-2) |  Atlanta (13-3) | 
2 | Pittsburgh (12-4) | Chicago(11-5) | 
3 | Indianapolis(10-6) |  Philadelphia (10-6)| 
4 | Kansas City(10-6) |  Seattle(7-9) | 
5 | Baltimore(12-4) | New Orleans(11-5) | 
6 | New York (11-5)|  Green Bay(10-6) |


This led to the stupidity of the 7-9 Seahawks hosting the 11-5 Saints.  With the seeded bracket system, it looks like this:


Rank | Team | Record 
---|------|----
1 | New England | 14-2\* 
2 | Atlanta | 13-3\* 
3 | Pittsburgh | 12-4\* 
4 | Baltimore | 12-4 
5 | Chicago | 11-5\* 
6 | New York (J) | 11-5 
7 | New Orleans | 11-5 
8 | Indianapolis | 10-6\*
9 | Kansas City | 10-6\* 
10 | Philadelphia |10-6\*
11 | Green Bay  | 10-6 
12 | Seattle | 7-9\*

\*   *denotes Division Champion*

Obviously, the tie-breaking procedures might want to be changed a bit, as we had 6 teams with 10-6 records, and only 4 could get in.  The three who won their division made it, but there was a logjam for that last spot.  Exactly how to decide these isn't a hard problem, though.

Interesting tidbits here:  

1. The four best records get the first round bye.  Two of them are in the same division, though.

2. Three division champions will not be hosting a playoff game due to the strength of some wild cards.  I feel like this rewards a team for winning the division (as two 10-6 teams do not make the playoffs, depending on the tiebreaker used).  However, it also rewards teams that performed well in difficult divisions (i.e., the Jets and Saints host a playoff game - and the Ravens even have a bye!)

3. The coolest thing (and the hardest thing to get used to) is non-conference playoff games.  The First round is:

Seattle @ Chicago

Green Bay @ New York Jets

Philadelphia @ New Orleans

Kansas City @ Indianapolis

Some familiar playoff matchups, some very strange.  Round 2 could see Chigaco @ New England, New York Jets @ Atlanta, Philadelphia @ Pittsburgh, and Indianapolis @ Baltimore.  Wow.

And you can't tell me you don't like the possibility of a Steelers/Ravens Superbowl (they are on different sides of the bracket here, so it *could* happen). 




 Josh McDaniels, obviously. 

Somehow, he is a success and it sticks in the craw of all Broncos fans everywhere as he wins a Superbowl for the resurgent Raiders.

That is so much more Raiders than Rex Ryan. 




 Honestly, with the way this group is playing, it appears as though we are only going to be able to compete against the bottom third (maybe even bottom quarter!) of the league.  Our division is very strong, and we have little to no chance against OKC when they get healthy (hell, we already botched one game against them when they were under-manned).  If you figure that we show up and compete hard in the games where we aren't out-matched, talent-wise, I can see us around 10 wins come January.  I mean, we have 32 games before Jan 1st.  10-22 seems WAY above how this team is performing right now, doesn't it?  That's going 8-15 over the next 1.5 months.  It is possible, but I think unlikely.

Now, for what I think happens.  Others are correct in that we have a lot of pieces (and very good ones!) for which to offer some contenders.  Once January comes around, if we're sub-10 wins, I think we go for the all-out tank, and start trading some of those pieces to contenders.  I think that you make two of Ty, Faried, and Gallo untouchable, but everyone else can be got.  I think that is a splendid core, and allows us to offer Mozgov to Cleveland, Foye to a team who needs a 3-point shooter, Nate to a contender who wants a little more bench scoring, etc, etc.  Stockpile picks and young talent, and hope the balls come out in our favor.  

This team looks like garbage right now, and the NBA isn't exactly fair with its talent acquisition process (Chicago, LA, NY will ALWAYS have an advantage over Denver, Sacramento, and even OKC), but we have done a very good job nabbing talent in the middle of the 1st round in the recent past (Faried and Lawson being the shining examples).  We need that star to kick us up a notch.

As for Shaw?  My jury is still out on that one.  This may just be a McDaniels situation (not the cheating, petulant, horrible human being part - just the inexperience in Head Coaching and poor player relationships part) that we have to scrape away and start anew.  It'll be very telling how he and the team handle this gigantic suckfest that I predict will soon be upon us. 




 Yeah, it is very selective memory whenever a bad loss happens.  Passionate fans are always just super-worried about their team's success and a loss makes them feel very uneasy.  Some people are quick to forget that:

1.  Last Year, the Seahawks lost to Arizona at home, despite Carson Palmer throwing 4 interceptions.  The same year, the Broncos got clowned by the Chargers, at home, in a fashion eerily similar to yesterday's loss to the Rams.  Both teams went on to play in the Superbowl.

2.  The Ravens were left for dead in December.  They had just fired their offensive coordinator, and looked like absolute garbage.  Super Bowl Champions.

3.  The Giants.  Ever.

4.  Green Bay looking like garbage the whole year, sneaking in, and going on a run.

Just punch your ticket, boys, and we'll see how January goes.  There's still lots of time to look good.

 




 Yeah, but they'd all be Sam Rockwell.

Actually, that's okay.  Carry on. 




 "DAE Padding stats?  LOL, Peyton/Fox are poor sports!"

Did you watch the game?  How about the vine?  It is still the 3rd quarter here.  Peyton came in *for one play* and then the Lobster had the whole fourth quarter.  It is kind of amazing how far some of you will stretch the events to fit your preconceived narrative. 




 This is exactly what happened to me.  Wife and I switched over to the hockey and saw 1-0, 19:15, and then the stretcher!

"What the fuck did we miss!?"

Very scary.  Good to hear he seems to be doing okay. 




 Oops, fine for "Leah Strong" on the eye black.

 I remember being *very* excited when Tulo signed his long-term deal.  Ditto CarGo.  And, I loved when Ubaldo looked to be inked for a long time, too.  I thought that this core group could compete and give Colorado baseball a strong chance to be entertaining.

These things did not happen.  Ubaldo underperformed, Tulo and CarGo were often injured and also underperformed.  I am not saying that you set everything ablaze and start completely fresh, but a step in the right direction is entertaining any and all offers for our last-generation stars, while attempting to develop our new boys. 




 Just got a changetip account!  Looking forward to using it to teach facebook friends about bitcoin!

(I already had some coin). 




 Nice article, but this is a little misleading:

If this story is true, then wealthy Russians will need a way to convert Ruble holdings into US dollars.  One of the easiest and least transparent channels would be to buy bitcoin and then convert those holdings into other fiat currencies.

Specifically, I take issue with the "least transparent" part of that statement.  Transactions on the blockchain are inherently transparent!  I think what the author is trying to say is that doing these transactions through bitcoin are less noticeable when compared to something like directly trading rubles for dollars or gold or other stores of value.

Is this nitpicking on my account, or is it important to clear up this misconception?

We **R** never give up.  

But we have lots to fix.

They're both probably right.

 This is about exactly how I feel.  These teams are both great, and it is fine to be fiery after a bad loss on the road.  Bottom line:  "The Best Team" is up to opinion until we start playing elimination games and the loser just goes home.

 We're still about three times more likely to win the #1 seed than the Pats are.  The predictive stats say that New England will be coming here in the playoffs.  Obviously, anything can happen, but losing this game is certainly not the end of our #1 seed hopes.

 The folks over at [fivethirtyeight](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/nfl-week-9-playoff-implications-a-crucial-week-for-the-saints-and-panthers/) have you covered on this one.

tl;dr:  Broncos at 59.7% to win AFC top seed now, Patriots at 20.6.  Next closest is Indy at 6.9%.

FUCKIN' PATS FAN. 




 I got it.  Predominantly Orange post two days ago explains it well. 




 Every three years, but yes, that's correct.   But, that means the other two games were due to both teams finishing 1st in their division, right?  Why were *both* of those in Foxboro, again?  I have read the reason before but can't remember. 

Edit:  figured it out.  The position - based divi on all games are on two-year cycles. 




 How about that defense?  I mean, I know Detroit isn't exactly known for lighting up the scoreboard, but you hold a team under 80 and you will win a lot of those games.

And did you hear The Manimal talk about Josh Smith shooting his team out of the game?  Seems like people are listening to Shaw.

I like the bigs, too.  The three-man rotation of Mozgov, Nurkic, and McGee gives us a lot of hard fouls and good rebounding.   




 Ehh, turnovers happen, especially with new guys.  It's not like we're going to see a 64-59 game here. 




 Auto corrects to shaved every time. 




 People were shitting all over this game like it was going to be an affront to basketball.  It's been fine!  




 Nov 5th, I think.   




 Good.  And *no repeating praise*! 




 I will still say that Champ Bailey saved our entire 2005 season, and turned it into something special.  I remember it like it was yesterday:

I was in my 2nd year at college, and I couldn't watch very many games, so I would listen to 850 KOA online (when they still let you do that).  Week two, we were reeling from a 34-10 drilling in Miami, and playing [San Diego at home] (http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2005091813/2005/REG2/chargers@broncos#tab=recap recap=fullstory).  The first half was abysmal, and we went into the locker room down 14-3, hearing boos from the fans after six straight shitty quarters.  And the Chargers got the ball to start the 3rd!

Then Champ pick-sixed Drew Brees on the first play.

The defense held San Diego to 41 yards in the second half, which we would eventually win 20-17 on a last-second Jason Elam field goal.  We were inches from 0-2, in the AFC West basement, and playing like absolute dogshit.  But Champ would not have it.  He had one of the best seasons a CB has ever had, and it started on this day.   




 Any Patriots fan out there down for a signature bet?  Loser must offer praise to the winner's franchise, players, coaches, etc as an italicized signature for every /r/nfl post until the end of the MNF game of week 10. 




 I say Indigenous Persons. 




 *Wave your hand in the air if you feel fine . . .* 




 That's my S.O.P. 




 Depending on this punt, we may see a free kick here! 




  I'll take it.  How do you feel about punting?  I would like to not have a punter on the roster. 




 Look within yourself.   It is destined for overtime.  You *know* it to be true. 




 Is this an appropriate forum to discuss my recent obsession with *Girls Chase Boys*? 




 There is not enough whiskey.

(But there is) 




 This seems to be a blind spot for NFL coaches.  I would onside or mid-squib every time.  Onside will result in either a new possession,  or their ball at the 40ish.  Squib could pin inside the 10.  Coaches need to consider this. 




 I have never seen Jerry Jones and Jason Garret on the same screen together.  Could they be the same person?  Like, a *Looper* type of situation? 




 Oh yeah, one of those really long deep slimy ones that you can feel slide out of your throat as it comes out. 




 Colt McCoy's skill is directly related to the state of the US economy. 




 That was like Dan Snyder in the Southpark episode, *Go Fund Yourself*.

 Robocop!!! 




 So, we get all-oranges next year for a couple of cool games, which I have wanted for ever, and then the 2016 season we get to show off the Nike-designed new stuff?  What is the usual time-table for revealing new uniform/logo design.  Usually it feels like we don't know anything until the offseason beforehand (like the Bucs this year).  But, with Nike wanting to use the Broncos re-design as a posterchild or flagship, I figured that they might want a little more pomp than that.

Also, I have pieced together a number of your answers in this post, so I am going to describe what I am picturing so far:

Helmet:  Mostly chrome/light grey.  Orange "D" makes a comeback on the helmet with an updated chrome horse which looks like a cross between the old "D" horse and our newer swoopy horse.

Home Jersey:  Mostly a dark grey (not the light grey of the Seahawks) with Orange numbers.  Orange shoulder accents with a design similar to the Bucs new stuff.  Pants will be grey, too?

Aways:  White-Out!  Aside from the orange "D" on the helmet, outline for player names, and player numbers, we're all white here.  Seems like there is a possibility to have orange bottoms, as well.  Camouflage-style plays during snowstorms will change the game.  Broncos choose to wear white at home in playoff games and bring the snow-making machines from the ski slopes to guarantee a snow-covered field.

Alternate Home:  Orange featured more prominently than the grey.  Possibility for all-orange.   

Looking forward to the mock-ups from your buddy, and the official announcement as well! 




 They'll never be, "Royals".

(I like "Admirals") 




 Swept your team. 




 Wow, Panthers.   




 Game plan has to be get around the 50 for a Hail Mary. 




 Dan Fouts just described the players as, "Culprits". 




 This is an absurdity pretending to be a football game. 




 No, they can't do that - Lions have too many downs left. 




 Why did ATL call a timeout there?  Are they all drunk? 




 Riddick is a person. 




 Don't be stupid.  No one does that.

 Just think about the particular history that you want to highlight.  Full Game Superbowls exist on youtube, just have strong Google-Fu.  "John Elway's Greatest Comebacks" are also on youtube.  You can find the entirety of "The Drive" and "The Drive II".  You can find Louis Wright returning the 2nd of two blocked FGs against the Chargers.  You can find the 1977 AFC Championship against the Raiders ( IT'S ALL OVER, FATMAN!!!).

Just go on a hunt.  It's all good!

 100% correct. 




 My girlfriend (now my wife) got me a Von orange during his rookie year (Xmas present).  I wore it as we lost to the Ravens and I fumed while cooking dinner.  I will wear it forever. 




 drooling sound 




 My wife and I are waiting to get DT or Julius, once they are signed.  There are very few, "sure things" in football, but one thing that I want to see if DT playing a game with his mom in the stands - and I hope he does it in orange. 




 They should get a Husky and call it, "Nymeria".

Duh. 




 Von Miller is a Pan-Dimensional being who has decided to grace us with his boring presence in this singular reality. 




 Fucking *sickness*.  This southpaw rocks it up with Pot Roast, flips out, and then hugs one out with Miles.  I would have fucking died at that age.  I guess it woulda been Trevor Price (maybe Simon Fletcher) for me. 

Nuts.  Good on ya, SouthPaw. 




 Just to rustle some jimmies:  OJ Simpson still has a bust in Canton. 




 My Mom and Dad were at that one, leaving me at home to swear and shout at the TV alone (uncommon for a 7th grader).  Get fucked, Belichick! 




 how is it that I have never heard the term, "Lamestream Media" before now? 




 I was at that game!!! (I was also at the game where Davis got over 2000, and the game where he went over 1000 at game 7).  Fuck you, Chiefs; fuck you, Seahawks.  TD4EVA!!! 




 I hope it is earlier than old Floyd Little made it in.  We (the Denver Broncos franchise) could draw real attention to the issue by making damn sure that nobody who dresses in blue and orange ever wears #30 again.  I love David Bruton as much as the next savvy special teams fan (Keith Burns, what up!?!?!), but *come the fuck on*. 




 YES!  I was not going to respond to my own post (obv).  Glad to see a civilized redditor.  Also, love your mustard bronco guy. 
























 People are just pissed that everyone but Ripley dies at the very beginning.  Couple that with the well-documented studio tampering and tinkering with Fincher, and you get an under-performing movie that everyone remembers as way worse than it is.  But, you're right, it is just fine.

I'll tell you what - if *Terminator: WeCan'tSpell*, *Star Wars: The Force*, and *Jurassic The Lost World Park World* are half of what Alien 3 was, then the 2015 blockbuster season will have over-performed.
 




 If only our teams weren't playing on the same day, I would have considered going with you, for sure. 




 This would indeed be the darkest timeline.

 




 What about on [Year Day] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Fixed_Calendar)? 




 If it makes you feel any better, my past interactions with you have led me to tag you essentially just that, so I am never confused when you say good things about the Peyton-led Broncos. 




 Groovy, man.  My wife got me a bottle of the 18 for Christmas - I'll have a dram in your honor tonight. 




 Go Panthers!  I want you cats to make some noise over there in the NFC! 




 I have had multiple bottles of both.

The 10 is very strong on the peat, extremely smokey and a little harsh.  There is also a clear medicinal character that comes through.

The 18 is very much the same idea, but I feel like the proportions are slightly different:  the peat is still up front and strong, but it is a little more rounded and smooth than the 10.  And the medicinal quality is the same, if not slightly stronger.

Recommendation:  get the 10; it is about 50-60% of the price, and will not be subtle about anything.  If you hate it, you probably won't like the 18, and if you love it you'll want to try the 18 later anyway.  If you try it and are on the fence, you might consider the 18 if you just want something a little smoother or less in-your-face. 




 You don't deserve watching your team play in the playoffs. 




 Yeah, I only have the fragmented paper backup - I restore the wallet from the paper fragments whenever I make a spend transaction from the cold storage.  You *could* keep a digital version too, but I don't.  I *might* decide to keep a USB with it encrypted - but that introduces a very weak single point (someone steals the USB).  They'd still need to break the encryption, though, so I am not sure.  I do have the fragment files encrypted and in the possession of four individuals who have good data storage practices.  So, if my paper fragments get lost in simultaneous fires, floods, etc, I CAN restore from a digital source, but it takes a number of additional steps (I have to collect the fragments from my buddies, decrypt them, and THEN restore the wallet).

Armory has an option for making fragmented paper backups.  The Armory website has lots of very good tutorials for that kind of thing (and lots more). Be sure to use the SecurePrint option to prevent someone from spying on your printer (or, write the fragment seeds by hand). 




 Yes.  You only need to know two Star Wars things:

1.  Laser Swords ("Lightsaber" in the parlance of the Star Wars) are awesome.

2.  You can lightning people, freeze people, choke people, and push/throw people.  In this game it isn't magic or mana.  It is "The Force".

Enjoy. 




 No worries, buddy. 




 Didn't I allow for bitcoin-based solutions to deferred payments in my second paragraph?

What in particular do you think I am incorrect about?  I definitely think that the solutions and points you made are right on.  Maybe you think I am giving Mr. CEO too much credit for his shortsighted opinion?  




 Exactly right.  Very important thing to keep in mind.  In fact you wouldn't even need a card - just flip your hardware wallet into credit mode with a button! 




 A Few tips:

1.  Don't mine.  Others have linked you to hardware specs and mining calculators, but for the most part the only people who can mine (profitably) are dedicated outfits with cheap electricity, cheap hardware, or both.  In general, as the hashing difficulty increased, it too more and more specific hardware to mine profitably.  So, it went from CPU - GPU - ASICs pretty quickly.  Now you certainly need ASICs.  If you're a big hardware geek, you might like putting together a mining rig as a hobby, however, so that's up to you.

2.  Do not day trade bitcoin.  It is too easy to lose money there.

3.  Figure out if you like the technology enough to buy some bitcoins for savings, or whether you'd rather just use it to pay for things / experiment.

4.  Educate yourself on good security practices.

5.  **If you do not own the private keys, you do not own the bitcoin**. 




 This seems like a reasonable enough opinion to me.  Credit cards are fine at deferring payment (never mind that they charge a *ridiculous* percentage of the amount for this "service").  And the "market share" of Credit, Cash/Debit, Bitcoin, if you want to call it that makes plain that there is lots of money out there and it is unlikely that Bitcoin will destroy or replace everything.

But, a bitcoin protocol could just as easily delay payment, and probably with less overhead and thus fewer ineffciencies.  I respect where this guy is coming from (different people have different payment needs; there's lots of room for many alternatives), but don't be surprised if Bitcoin is capable of performing the tasks that you figured were only the domain of the established payment systems. 




 Mycelium Wallet lets you import addresses by scanning a WIF QR code. (BIP32, too, I think). 




 The Armory website has a lot of nice tutorial videos for doing all kinds of things with that software.  Offline transactions are explained pretty well!   




 I'll help you out a bit by giving you an overview of the process that I have pieced together from a couple of different sources.

First, this is fairly time-consuming, but really only happens when I am legitimately moving a lot of bitcoins out of savings and into something else.  Ultimately, I like the setup because I feel like there are multiple redundant protections.  I like to imagine a virus called, "The Perfect Bitcoin Thief" or PBT, for short:  this virus can read all of your files and the clipboard, plus logs all of your keystrokes and will keep them in any available memory until it has an internet connection.  This is probably paranoia, but it helps me think in a worst-case kind of way.

So, like you, I have armory running a full client on a computer connected to the internet.  On here I have a general-spending wallet which is encrypted.  I don't keep many bitcoins in that wallet, it is mostly for a way to move coins on my PC (like, if I am buying a plane ticket from expedia or something).  The other wallet I have is a Watch Only Savings wallet, so I can't spend from it on the online machine at all.  This "Savings" wallet is backed up with a 3-of-4 fragmented paper backup.  I have the different fragments stored in distinct places (both within my residence and without), as well as encrypted digital backups I have sent friends/family members in case of some weird total loss.

So, to spend from my watch-only wallet, I boot an offline machine into TAILS from a USB stick with nothing else on it.  Then I can create an unsigned transaction with the watch only, transfer to the TAILS machine, sign it, and transfer it back to broadcast.  It all ends up looking like this:

1.  Create Unsigned transaction from watch-only wallet.

2.  Boot up TAILS from a live USB stick.

3.  Use another *virgin* USB stick which **never touches a machine that sees the internet** to load the offline bundle of Armory.  You *can* have a wallet file on this USB, too, but I just rebuild it from my paper fragments, as that reduces the risk.

4.  Sign transactions and move the signed transaction file between the TAILS system and the full Armory system.

5.  Broadcast the transaction from the full Armory computer.

So, how does PBT fair against my setup?

1.  The watch-only wallet with the funds has no private keys on the computer with connection to the internet.  PBT can have this wallet file - it does no good.  

2.  The only system which *ever* sees the fragmented backups (and hence the private keys) is TAILS without an internet connection.  Once I have the wallet, I load up the unsigned transaction, sign it, and eject the USB.  Unless my USB somehow downloads PBT, there's no way in.  TAILS wipes itself clean after every shutdown, so there's nowhere for the private keys to be stored, either.

3.  When connecting the USB with the signed transaction, do so with the Armory computer unconnected to the internet.  Then you can unload the signed transaction file and disconnect the USB, keeping it cleaner.  Be sure to look over your signed transaction before you broadcast it to make sure things are going where you want them too, just in case.

So that's it!  The main point of failure is (admittedly) the fragmented paper backup.  If someone was to steal three of the four fragments, they could reconstruct my wallet from scratch, and start spending those funds.  But, in a situation where one is in my home safe, one is in a security deposit box at a bank, one is at a family member's house, and one is in a file in my file cabinet at work (called something innocuous like "Group B Meeting Minutes, 2004"), I think this is an acceptable amount of risk.  Note:  these are only examples; I didn't just tell the internet where my paper backup fragments are!

If you wanted to make this a little more secure, you could run the 2-of-3 Lockbox into the same kind of system - only signing transactions on an offline TAILS machine.  I think you can do that, anyway.  Not sure.  I hope that helps.  I have been struggling with finding a system that makes me feel at ease, and I think this one is my favorite so far.  




 To be fair, I am pretty confident that if my house cat was the size of a serval or caracal (to say nothing of a lion or tiger), she'd kill me too, one of these days. 




 I see you've been in *1989* for too long, too. 




 Ooh, I have been toying with hate-watching "God is ^not Dead" for a while now.  How drunk should I get to make it entertaining? 




 There's some good, technical answers here, complete with some nice links, but the ELI5 is this:

Every bitcoin transaction needs to FULLY SPEND the funds in an address.  The amount you "want" to spend goes to the address you wanted, and the remainder is returned as change. 




 Is *Nymphomaniac* another example of this, or did Lars von Trier want it to be two parts? 




 As the article suggests, there may be some relationship between having very large gaps in between primes and some cryptographic algorithms, but I seriously doubt that this will affect much in a practical sense.

Different cryptographic systems take advantage of the properties of large prime numbers in different ways (difficulty of factoring the product of two large primes, arithmetic modolo a large prime, etc, etc), but largely these algorithms don't choose the prime numbers to use based off of the gap size between the adjacent primes.  Like, if you wanted to use the first of a twin prime for the modulo arithmetic of RSA - you could (I don't know if you would want to, though - the twin primes are kinda special so many very large ones are well-known, slightly reducing your randomness).

Ultimately, it seems to me that this work is largely academic (and very interesting, don't get me wrong!) but it likely has only slight application to most cryptographic systems.

If someone with a little more background in the nuts-and-bolts of these disciplines (Number Theory and Cryptography) believes that I have missed something critical, I'd love to hear about it, as I am merely an armchair prime number enthusiast.

 sick.  bookmarked. 




 Maker's (and Maker's 46) have the quality of being slightly sweeter and lighter than a lot of bourbons (it comes from being so heavily made from wheat).

Other great options in the Maker's price range which could have slightly different tastes are Buffalo Trace, Eagle's Rare, Four Roses, Bulleit (both bourbon and rye) and even slightly nicer things like Woodland Reserve (which I don't really care for, personally - but lots of folk dig).

You go up a price point and you get Willett (Rye is awesome, bourbon's fine, too), Blanton's, and a bunch more.  Feel around with different profiles, definitely try out a rye or two for the spicy character (Bulleit Rye for the low end, Willet or Whistlepig for the high end) and see where it takes you.

Oh man.  And then there's scotch . . . 




 This is one of those crazy coincidences that makes life so cool!  I was thinking about this exact problem for the last few days, but it was on a much more abstract level as I am not trained as a computer scientist.  As a Bitcoin enthusiast, though, I was focusing on utilization blockchain-like technology to get it done, so I am excited to read your stuff.

I am going to enjoy reading this thoroughly; thanks for the full text!

It isn't easy completing an advanced degree (March '14 for me).  Have a beer on me as a congratulations! /u/changetip  




 I count in base 12 all the time (dozenal).  It's pretty sweet. 




 No shit.  Do you sex and money? 




 You are Spartacus!

(By the way, this *should* be the response when some group or another tries to threaten a select few - everyone stands in opposition.  It should have happened with the Danish Cartoons, and it should have happened here.) 




 Hmm.  What's the difference between jam and jelly? 




 Calmer than you are. 




 I took your comment at face-value, assuming that you meant that ESPN anchors would literally be sitting in a circle, jerking each other off in a communal masturbatory fantasy focusing on Tebow and Manziel as they scramble and throw mostly off-target passes.

They could get a new plexiglass desk so you could get a real good view of all the cranking going on down there.  

Who do you think has the biggest cock?  I'm a homer, so I'd like to think the TJ has a nice, strong, veiny one - even in his old age.  Though it is always the unassuming guys like Schefter who have the pythons.

Okay, I'll stop now. 




 [Relevant xkcd] (http://xkcd.com/37/) 




 All right then.  They've got the 9ers next week, they should be push-overs.

 




 Please game-plan as if Manning is hurt.  Seriously.  Put 8 in the box, because he can't beat you 40-yards down-field between the numbers, at all.  

If there are coordinators who seriously do think this, they should probably be fired. 




 Probably all of those things at once.  Some folk will be more savvy, some less.

The article claims that there are some businesses already accepting, and have been even before the announcement of the Bitcoin Bowl.  So, you'd assume that the earlier folk know what they're doing. 




 Or [Coywolves!] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coywolf)

Thanks, nature.

 




 This is exactly why the #5 seed in the NFC isn't going to cakewalk through the first round.

Of course, the Panthers, Saints, and Falcons are having sub-par years (all at once!), but would you really like for your first playoff game to be against Drew Brees or Matt Ryan in a dome?  Sure, they looks very, very bad for a long time.  But you only get to play one game.  It sure would be unfortunate if you ran into a buzzsaw. 




 Likewise.  I had basically already written off NY state - I just "knew" they were going to fuck up and get something wrong.

Glad to be wrong!
 




 You're right there, and the next step is actually just an "Eureka!!!" moment:

You don't remove the incentive!

You want to move house deeds, car titles, AirBnB keys, notarized documents, etc, etc over a blockchain?  Then the "miners" who are securing this chain get transaction fees (in bitcoin).  Alternatively, you could be rewarded with a different cryptocurrency, which may have its own value (either within this particular blockchain, or through exchanging it for bitcoin).

Simple example:  I want a blockchain which allows the movement of car titles.  Whenever someone wants to sell a car and transfer the title, they hop on CarCoin, broadcast the transaction (Title 1:  Owner A -- Owner B, agreed price, etc, etc) to the network.  At set interval, all transactions are placed into the next block, mining happens, and someone wins the race, the blockchain is extended, miner's fees are given to the miners (this could even be in bitcoin!), and CarCoin reward is given to the miner who won the race.  

Maybe CarCoin can be exchanged for bitcoin.  Maybe CarCoin can buy cars outright.  Maybe the transaction fees (in bitcoin) provide enough of an incentive, particularly because this mining would be less difficult than bitcoin mining.
 
 




 I'm gonna tell him . . . 




 Look up the Dutch Tulip bubble.  It was one of the weirdest and clearest examples of a financial bubble in the preindustrial world.  Basically tulip bulbs became huge stores of value until one day it just popped.

First comment is saying Bitcoin is a bubble.  Second person is saying that argument is old and worn out.

 




 Yup.  Worked out just fine!  Thanks!  




 Pretty cool.  How many brick-and-mortar joints in Chicago accept bitcoin?  I did a search about two months ago on one of the store finders and found nothing. 




 The other woman (Anne Sullivan) was the miracle worker.  Helen Keller was the one who got miracled on.  




 Yeah, he was a solid punter in college.   




 Yeah, he did in college, and also in preseason with the Titans (I believe).
Will edit with source.

edit:  [Source](http://www.giants.com/team/roster/Brandon-McManus/68d3ec74-2f8e-4dde-80df-3638a4063651).  Very reasonable punter in college, not clear if he punted in NFL preseason from this blurb. 




 Yeah, that's the idea.  He punted in college (and I believe early in his pro career with Tennessee in preseason games or something).

This would also clear some more monies off the cap for next year.

edit:  in three years punting in college he had averages of 42.3 (on 4 punts) 45.8 (on 46 punts) and 45.1 (on 54 punts).  That seems pretty reasonable to me, right?  It isn't like punting is that much different between pro and college levels. 




 Looks like Barth will be on a short leash regarding kickoffs.  I would say if he has another poor showing on kickoffs this week (especially in Denver), then we can expect one of two moves:

1.  McManus is signed to the active roster as a kickoff specialist / long FG kicker. Room is made by dropping an end-of-bench player to the practice squad.  

2.  McManus is signed as a Kickoff specialist / Punter.  Britton Colquit is waived.  This is the more extreme of the two moves. 




 Largely, the differences are cosmetic, I admit.  But Mastercard is explicitly attacking something that I believe in (albeit very poorly), so they have given me a reason.

Ideally, I could bail on all of them (Master, AmEx, and Visa) and relegate my relationship with them to zero or close to zero.  At the moment, it is a step in the right direction to reduce my footprint, so to speak. 




 Groovy, thanks a bunch, will continue thinking about this.

Here's 1000 bits for your trouble! /u/changetip

 




 How has this gone for you?  Not asking about RoI or anything like that, more about how the process went, whether it was difficult and if so where the sticking points were.  Happy with it?  Would you do it again (for example, if a spouse or sibling wanted to set one up)? 




 I think I am going to close my MasterCard account.

They make me call them up to do it.  I have never really had the impetus to actually go forward with it (yay inertia!), but I think this might do it.

If they ask me why, I think I will tell them that it is because their stance on Bitcoin is blatant protectionism and ultimately destructive. 




 The Broncos did it in '85, too.  Admittedly it was easier then as only 5 teams made the playoffs, but there were also fewer automatic berths (3 vs the 4 we have now).  So, you can say that both the '85 Broncos and '08 Patriots were third in the Wild Card race at 11-5.  Pretty crazy. 




 I came up with all kinds of schemes like this, but here's the problem:

Division A B C (in AFC) and Division D E F (in NFC).

Let's say that first year it is A vs B, C vs D and E vs F (this is the most difficult case - we both seem to understand that it is easy when it is only cross conference years).

In your system, A and B play each other, meaning that to get their last two games they have to play 1 game against the similar finish from C, and one game against the similar finish from D (for A) and E (for B).  This is what you call "same division but cross conference".  Unfortunately, while E is fine with this, D is not.  D is already playing a full division cross conference (C), so their schedule is easily filled with the two like-finishing teams from their conference (E and F)

See, the trouble that I always ran into was that with only 6 divisions, if they all didn't play cross-conference, then you'd have a mixed split:  4 divisions would play within the conference, and two wouldn't.  Making symmetric schedules with that happening causes sad problems!

More and more I like a 5-year rotation where you play every team in the division.  The final two games will always be the teams with like finishes in your conference, resulting in some years where you play a home-and-home against a non-divisional conference foe.  I like that a lot, actually.

So, in our example from above, A vs B, C vs D, and E vs F we get the following: C and D are cross conference, so their schedules are easy, they just play like finishes from their conference.  A and B play each other, the similar finish from C, and the similar finish between A and B again (E and F are similar).

Could you imagine Broncos/Patriots with a home-and-home?  Or Green Bay/Seattle?  The potential for a third game in the playoffs?  That's pretty awesome. 




 Yeah, that was something that I really didn't like.  The trouble is, if you decide to play an entire division on a rotating schedule, it becomes nontrivial to schedule those last two games (because when you play in your conference, you don't have only two opponents at like finishes - you have four.

Any ideas? At first I thought you could  have a cycle using two divisions (like now).  But because there are only 6 divisions, nothing matches up.

My favorite solution (and possibly most elegant) is that when you play an entire division in your conference, you still play the teams in your conference with like finishes.  This creates scenarios where two teams in the same conference but from different divisions play each other twice (home and home).  Would be great for playoff positioning. 




 Winning one more game then NE from here on out is hardly "a miracle".

Both Broncos and Patriots play a home game against Buffalo, and a Road game against San Diego.

The Patriots then get @Jets and Miami, whereas Denver gets @Cincy and Oakland.

Sure, their schedule is a little easier than ours, but Miami already beat them once, and the Jets lost on a last-second FG.  Recall that it was the exact same scenario last year, and the Patriots lost to the Dolphins to give up the #1 seed.

Also, one scenario that very few of the talking heads mention, is that in the case of a 3-way tie (or more) at the top of the conference, they no longer rely on head-to-head records as the tiebreaker.  So, even though New England beat us, Cincy, and Indy, that tiebreaker only matters if they are trying to break a single tie.  For example, if Denver, New England, and Cincinnati all lose one more game and Indianapolis wins out, those teams will be 12-4, 12-4, 11-3-1, and 12-4, respectively. But, the tiebreaker doesn't go to the Patriots (for beating Indy and Denver head-to-head) - it goes to the Broncos for having the better conference record (in this case, 10-2, the Pats and Colts already have lost 2 and 3 AFC games, respectively).

My point is:  we have a fairly good chance, especially with the way we are playing! 




 Definite feature of this realignment.  Also, it will be very, very unlikely that a division can be run away with in a six team setup - at least two teams will be very good most of the time.

edit:   I mean, let's just pretend that the expansion teams are all garbage for now, and you still have six ultra-competative divisions:

The AFC West is the same:  Broncos, Chargers, Chiefs at the top within 2 games.

The AFC Central is mind-boggling, as you have the Bengals at 8-3-1, Colts at 8-4, Steelers, Browns, Ravens at 7-5.  

The AFC East is the weakest, with the Patriots having a 2-game lead on everyone.

NFC is pretty much the same, largely because the NFC South is underperforming this year.

 




 How often does she tease you about Favre? 




 Yeah, we're really close.  It really just comes down to what you'd like to preserve:  rivalry, or geography, and I can see arguments for both. 




 My thoughts were similar, but I decided to completely preserve the East/North/West divisions.  It's cool to see just how close we were to each other. 




 I'm going to give my try at this, too.  I love Nate Silver and read his piece when it came out, so I will stay with London, Toronto, Mexico City, and Los Angeles as the expansion cities.

I think that the best way to actually add new teams isn't to stir up everything as much as possible to make "geographic sense", but to make small tweaks while preserving age-old rivalries.  Hence, I will be working with two Conferences (AFC and NFC; if you want to change the "National Football Conference" to the "International Football Conference" that would be fine, too, but I'll keep them the Same.

**American Football Conference**

 East |  Central |  West
------------|--------------|-------------
New England | Pittsburgh | Denver
Miami | Cleveland | Kansas City
New York Jets | Cincinnati | Oakland
Buffalo | Indianapolis | San Diego
Jacksonville | Tennessee | Houston
Toronto | Baltimore | Mexico City

and

**National Football Conference**

East | Central | West 
----------|-----------------|-----------------
Dallas | Green Bay | San Francisco
Philadelphia | Chicago | Seattle
Washington | Minnesota | Arizona
New York Giants | Detroit | St. Louis
Carolina | Tampa Bay | New Orleans
London | Atlanta | Los Angeles


For the most part, I like this re-alignment.  I am a little pissed that New Orleans has to be in the NFC West, and that Atlanta and Tampa moved to the Central, but there are just SO MANY east coast teams that some of them had to go somewhere.  I was basically able to keep every East, West, and North division together, then got to sprinkle in members of the South with new teams where they made (at least some) sense. This is *kind of* disrespectful to the AFC and NFC South, but frankly if you were to choose a division in each conference to break up, these are the most recently created, and harm historical rivalries the least.  Indy/Tennessee and Tampa Bay/Atlanta get to bring a buddy with them, but the Saints, Panthers, Texans, and Jaguars are not so lucky.  But, except for the Saints, these are all relatively recent expansion teams, so it seams like the way to do the least harm.

So, there's my two cents:  we preserve the most storied rivalries, add two new teams to each conference in geographically sound divisions, and are even fairly immune to moves by the Rams, Raiders, or Chargers (i.e., the geography still makes sense if they go to LA, San Antonio, etc).

As for the schedule - we bump it up to 20 weeks with two bye weeks and two preseason games (so, 22 game-weeks, vs. the 21 we have now).  The byes can either be strategically placed to allow teams to travel internationally / play on Thursday, *or* can be set up so that each team gets a bye in the first half and second half of the year.  

The scheduling would be a little complex, but I think very cool:  10 games against your division (home   home, obv), 6 games against another division from the opposite conference, and 2 games against those in your conference who finish at a similar ranking as you. This reduces the number of game that you play within your conference, unfortunately, but I don't see another option.  I would be glad to hear others' thoughts on this one. 

Camps can start a little earlier to allow for joint practice sessions and/or additional talent evaluation.  Because 12/36 playoff teams is equal to the percentage of teams that currently make the playoffs in baseball (with the WC play-in game it is now 10/30, the same ratio), you could choose to keep it to 12 teams, or you could bump it up to 14, where the top seed in each conference gets a bye.  I am also a fan of moving towards a seeded bracket with no regard for conference, but that is a different discussion.  

No Thursday night games unless both teams are coming off of a bye!  Late in the season (after College Football's regular season is done), you can schedule two games on Saturday to highlight additional playoff-potential games.  These could be scheduled in advance with the opportunity to flex, as the Sunday night games are now.

Thoughts?

tl;dr - Keep West/East/North largely intact, sprinkle members of the South and new teams throughout those.  Go to 20 weeks (18 games), and possibly add two more playoff teams.
 




 In addition, there were those two plays (first Tamme, then DT) where the receiver dropped a sure touchdown that hit him in the hands.  This led to our first FG.

Then to close the 2nd half, DT tried to shake-and-bake and ended up with a 3rd-and-1 instead of a 1st-and-Goal with ~20 seconds left (no timeouts).  That is the difference between one shot at the endzone, and three.  This was our second FG.

No doubt, there are always near-misses in the red zone which downgrade TDs into FGs, but these seemed to be out-of-character for our team. 




 FUCK!  I knew that sounded funny.  Oh well.  Leaving it because mistakes are important. 




 Personally I agree with you that it isn't a "Stellar Human Hall of Fame" but a lot of people think that character plays a factor.  Keeping a bad human in the Hall of Fame isn't hypocritical by itself, of course.

But promoting a "No More" campaign against domestic violence while a man who murdered his ex-wife is in your Hall of Fame?  That's a little harder for me to swallow.

(For what it is worth, the NFL claims that its Hall of Fame is privately run and so they can't decided who is in and who is out.  Which I am sure is true.)


 




 That's fucking gross!

I'll take the Crab Juice. 




 But not gamblers!  We can't have those sick fucks gracing the glory of Springfield, MA!

Although, to be completely fair, a bronze bust of Mr. Orenthal James Simpson still sits in Canton to this day. 




 I think it was more about bringing him on one or two weeks before a game against his former team.  I really didn't care much, because I doubted that he even had very much info, but some folk were calling for rule changes here (so a coach couldn't be hired until the off season). 




 Yeah, that was exactly why I avoided blends - seems a ploy to make more cheap stuff with hints of the more scarce, expensive stuff. 




 Very cool stuff.  I don't think I have had a blended American Whiskey before that I really enjoyed. 




 I do like those things.  I shall investigate. 




 If the Pats lose *one* more game in this last quarter of the season than do the Broncos, the #1 seed belongs to the Broncos.

Your team offers one of the two best chances at a Patriots loss (the other being Miami).

Also, we get to take care of you ourselves in two weeks.  We already flubbed that one @ New England. 




 I just moved to Wisconsin for the first time! 

It's been fine.  Cheese curds are cool.  Need to buy some cognac.  You know any good cognac? 




 What's the opening line, Horsefriend?  I would relish seeing Felipe Rios ravage Mr. Bellichick and his Patriots. 




 I am pretty sure that Fox was back from his heart thing by the last week of the year (@ Oakland, week 17), but he did miss @San Diego (1 week after the bye, when he learned of his heart dealie), and I think that @Kansas City was the last game he missed.

Regardless, those games where there are interim coaches with the HC out for injury are *generally* credited as HC wins for both the interim coach (so, Jack of the River) and the head coach.  Which is weird.

So, *technically* he is 11-0.  But he actually only coached in 9 of those games. 




 Yeah, that's what I meant - McDaniels left the Rams and joined the Patriots for that post-season, slightly more than one-year removed from being fired by Denver.  It was argued (by some) that it was a little shady, although I don't think it matters all that much. 




 I have a perfect example of this!

I was a with a group of friends about 5 or 6 years ago down in Tampa (went to school in Gainesville), and we were going to a Crepe joint before seeing a Cirque du Soleil show.  Anyway, on our way out of the restaurant, I saw a family with two young kids: one was probably 9 or 10, and the other maybe 1-2 years younger.  The older one was proudly sporting a new Buccaneers jersey (I do not recall which player), whereas the younger one had on a Tom Brady jersey.

When I tried to explain to my friends that the younger child was very likely a scum-of-the-Earth bandwagoner, and his older brother/friend the true champion and deserving of our praise, I was judged as being far too harsh.  Perhaps I shouldn't have gone so far as to say that I "hated" the little bastard - but I calls 'em like I sees 'em. 




 Didn't he get fired at the end of the season, and the Bellichick brought him in as an "offensive consultant" just before the Tebow Broncos had to go to New England?  I remember Woody Paige bitching about it (he does that a lot, though). 




 Oh god, NO!  I attended UF for graduate school (and my wife for both undergrad and grad school!).  *We must not suffer this abysmal man to coach another of our beloved blue   orange teams!* 




 Well, I guess it makes sense that the Niners fan doesn't know about him.  He was only targeted five times (two receptions for 9 yards!) in the San Francisco game.
 




 Damn, you're right - my head was somewhere else.

My point stands - bowling ball. 




 Low center of gravity.  He's like 5'8" and 180ish.  He's like a fucking bowling ball.

 Looks good to me.  I was concerned about Barth's kickoffs (as that was the one part of McManus's game that was *very* strong), but this is encouraging! 




 Does it make me an asshole to take this piece less seriously because the author makes multiple grammar mistakes throughout?  Here's one sentence (fragment!) early on:

A world that is experience(sic) the side effects of rampant climate change, a country where we would rather spend $11.50 on a movie ticket then(sic) spend that much per year, per person to adequately fund the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). 

I know good grammar, diction, spelling, etc are not the most important things in the world, and these could just be honest mistakes.  But if your goal is to persuade readers with cogent arguments, shouldn't you be really careful about these things?  It just comes off as lazy, sloppy, and frankly ill-informed.  If Mr. Manser doesn't take the time to proofread his piece (or simply doesn't know the difference), how confident am I supposed to be in the more high-level analysis and opinions that he puts forth? 




 "I can't swim". 




 So, after a little bit of reading, I have come to understand that these molecules (in their liquid state) *are not flammable*.  So, I couldn't just take a torch to the hydrocarbon lake and burn the whole thing up, right? 




 I want the Falcons to go undefeated in the division and windless outside of the division. 




 I am afraid of Julius Thomas becoming a Raider next year. 




 If you want to look only at last year, then you can do that, but I'd rather not base my evaluation of a player on his extreme outlier, career year.   




 Yeah, as far as I know, Dustin is fine.  I am not sure what his cap hit is, but with a team built like the Chiefs (more T.O.P controlly, willing to play the field position game with an Alex Smith), there is more of a reason to have a higher-paid punter than there is with a Peyton Manning offense. 




 There is no metric by which you can consider Prater "one of the best kickers in the league", unless you look only at his one stellar season (2013, where he went 25-for-26), or perhaps "Longest FG", for which he of course owns the record.  His work as a whole is fairly average. [Here] (http://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/fg_perc_career.htm) you'll see that he is 31th all-time in career FG%, ranking 20th among active kickers.  So, there are 19 kickers currently playing that are more accurate.  I will grant you that he is stellar from 50+ (24/32 or 75%), but that is tempered by his 40-49 (37/58 or 63.7%).

Ultimately, I think releasing Prater was the correct choice, due to the money issue and the potential off-the-field issue.  Perhaps McManus was the wrong replacement, but the small sample size make me want to see more of him, despite the funk he is in.  Maybe his confidence is just completely gone, but kickers go through funks all the time, and he is still a rookie.

 




 ooh, I like sneaky intra-division moves/rumors. 




 Exactly my point.  With the money the Broncos could save on just these two players, they could, for example, pay Julius Thomas's franchise tag next year (or very close to it, depending on the value), if they decide to go that way.  Even if the impact isn't quite *that* high, the highest return on that money cannot be Prater or Colquitt, even if they are top 5 at their position (which they are not). 




 I don't think they regret releasing Prater.  They may regret signing McManus (and subsequently losing a 7th round draft pick to the Giants), but getting Prater's money off of the books was a very smart idea.  I believe that the same thing will happen with Colquitt (punter) next year. 




 This is slightly false - The 33 yard FG was missed while we were down 4, true.  But, the defense actually forced a stop and punt - which Isiah Burse fumbled.  The resulting short field led to the touchdown and the 11 point lead (assisted by a defensive holding on a 3rd down stop). 




 Fuck you you dirty pirate criminal. 




 I mean, Oreo line is OP. 




 I mean, Oreo line is OP. 




 Yeah, totally am used to it.  I can't say I agree with these views, but realistically how bad can being super Christian really be?  I always figured I'd rather have Tebow preaching than Big Ben raping, Rae Carruth murdering, or Adrian Peterson/Ray Rice beating. 




 Von Miller you really should move to Denver.  That commute must kill you.

 I've been playing Magic, off and on, for almost 20 years now - in Colorado, Florida, and a few times since moving to Madison.  PM if you're still looking for more folks to have a discussion. 




 Yeah, there's a sweet article on the site that Brandon Perna writes for, suggesting that we will let Moore walk and try Kayvon at the FS position in training camp to see if it fits.  Obviously, there is some risk that it won't,  but Kayvon is squarely buried at 4th CB on the depth chart, and he has some serious talent (he's just playing behind two of the best in the NFL, plus a rookie who made an impact - not easy to do at the CB position).  This way, he gets to compete for playing time elsewhere, and if it doesn't work out, he goes back to CB depth.

Seems like a great move to me. 




 A duck walks into a liquor store and asks the teller, "Hey, man - you got any corn?"

The clerks says, "No, sorry Duck, we don't sell corn here."  So the duck thanks the clerk and leaves.

The next day, the same duck comes into the same liquor store and once again asks for some corn.  Again, the teller politely informs him that they do not sell corn at the liquor store.  He is a little agitated, though.

The day after that, the duck returns.  And once again, he asks the clerk, "You got any corn?".  This time, the clerk loses it:  "No, you stupid duck - I already told you twice that we don't sell corn here.  This is a liquor store!  If you come in here and ask for corn again, I am going to nail your goddamn feet to the floor!"

So the duck leaves.

Then, the next day, the duck returns, walks up to the clerk, and asks, "You got any nails?".  The clerk says, "No." So the duck says, "Well, then you got any corn?"

 It is a coaching musical chairs!

(Shanny lost) 




 They were more mediocre than "bad" - Phillips was 16-16 as our head coach (16-17 if you count the playoff loss to the LA Raiders).  Really, the best thing you can say about that period was that Phillips was a clear caretaker until Shanny was wiling to take the HC job. 




 Exactly!  We're probably less than 25 years away from the ability to do basically anything shown in that movie.

 Wow, the uphill battle for the playoffs gets . . . uphillier?

Isn't this the actual worst player on the team to lose to injury right now?   




 This is a very solid hire for a number of reasons, many of which are mentioned in other comments (Von and Ware being great OLB in the 3-4, Pot Roast being a prototypical NT, etc), but one that I think is going overlooked is the benefit that this will have on the running game.

The zone-blocking running game is very strong, but it can have some issues with the 3-4, due to the difficulty in communicating assignments and just the spacing of the players.  If the Broncos get to practice against the 3-4 themselves, all the time, we may see better performance against these defenses. 




 Copy-Pasting my response from a previous, similar question.  

I'm going to give my try at this, too.  I love Nate Silver and read his piece when it came out, so I will stay with London, Toronto, Mexico City, and Los Angeles as the expansion cities.

I think that the best way to actually add new teams isn't to stir up everything as much as possible to make "geographic sense", but to make small tweaks while preserving age-old rivalries.  Hence, I will be working with two Conferences (AFC and NFC; if you want to change the "National Football Conference" to the "International Football Conference" that would be fine, too, but I'll keep them the Same.

**American Football Conference**

 East |  Central |  West
------------|--------------|-------------
New England | Pittsburgh | Denver
Miami | Cleveland | Kansas City
New York Jets | Cincinnati | Oakland
Buffalo | Indianapolis | San Diego
Jacksonville | Tennessee | Houston
Toronto | Baltimore | Mexico City

and

**National Football Conference**

East | Central | West 
----------|-----------------|-----------------
Dallas | Green Bay | San Francisco
Philadelphia | Chicago | Seattle
Washington | Minnesota | Arizona
New York Giants | Detroit | St. Louis
Carolina | Tampa Bay | New Orleans
London | Atlanta | Los Angeles


For the most part, I like this re-alignment.  I am a little pissed that New Orleans has to be in the NFC West, and that Atlanta and Tampa moved to the Central, but there are just SO MANY east coast teams that some of them had to go somewhere.  I was basically able to keep every East, West, and North division together, then got to sprinkle in members of the South with new teams where they made (at least some) sense. This is *kind of* disrespectful to the AFC and NFC South, but frankly if you were to choose a division in each conference to break up, these are the most recently created, and harm historical rivalries the least.  Indy/Tennessee and Tampa Bay/Atlanta get to bring a buddy with them, but the Saints, Panthers, Texans, and Jaguars are not so lucky.  But, except for the Saints, these are all relatively recent expansion teams, so it seams like the way to do the least harm.

The byes can either be strategically placed to allow teams to travel internationally / play on Thursday, *or* can be set up so that each team gets a bye in the first half and second half of the year.  

The scheduling would be very similar to what we do now, but there is a tweak which I think is very cool:  10 games against your division (home   home, obv), 6 games against a complete division (on yearly rotation, as now), and 2 games against those in your conference who finish at a similar ranking as you (so, 1st plays 1st, 2nd plays 2nd, etc - just like now).  This guarantees that you will play every team on a 5-year rotation, but offers up this little tweak:  on the years where you play a division in your own conference, you play *twice* against one team (the team that finished at the same place), which would be a home-and-home type of series between non-divisional opponents, which I think is awesome.

Camps can start a little earlier to allow for joint practice sessions and/or additional talent evaluation.  Because 12/36 playoff teams is equal to the percentage of teams that currently make the playoffs in baseball (with the WC play-in game it is now 10/30, the same ratio), you could choose to keep it to 12 teams, or you could bump it up to 14, where the top seed in each conference gets a bye.

Late in the season (after College Football's regular season is done), you can schedule two games on Saturday to highlight additional playoff-potential games.  These could be scheduled in advance with the opportunity to flex, as the Sunday night games are now.

Thoughts?

tl;dr - Keep West/East/North largely intact, sprinkle members of the South and new teams throughout those.  Go to 20 weeks (18 games), and possibly add two more playoff teams.

 Didn't know too much about this cat, so I did some of my own research in to his career over the past decade or so.  I have organized my analysis in to a table of Special Teams DVOA ranking for each of the past 8 years, both for DeCamillis' team (Chicago, Dallas, or Jacksonville;  I have decided not to go back to his 12-year stint with the Falcons), and the Broncos team (at the time).



Year | Joe DeC.'s Team | Joe De.C's Rank | Broncos Rank
---|---|----|----
2014 | CHI |25th | 27th
2012 | DAL | 15th | 13th
2011 | DAL | 25th| 18th
2010 | DAL | 15th | 27th
2009 | DAL | 14th | 18th
2008 | JAX | 21st | 31st
2007 | JAX | 14th | 28th


As I said before, this is football outsiders DVOA for special teams, which attempts to measure how many points the five areas of special teams add to (or take away from), to a team's point total, on average.  The five areas are kickoffs, punts, kick returns, punt returns, and FG/ Extra points.  In general, it is about a 50/50 split of teams with positive ratings and negative ratings, due to this being based on league average (although a huge outlier can throw this off by a bit).

Anyway, what should jump out to you first is that the Broncos have been absolutely awful at special teams for the better part of a decade.  Only once were we even above the league average! (2012).  Most of the time we are squarely mired in the bottom quarter of the league, which is just embarassing.

Comparatively, I would say that DeCamillis' teams have performed *slightly* better - most years he is right aroudn average, if not slightly above average (so, 14th or 15th), but there are years where his squad performs below league average, with the 25th ranked squards in 2014 and 2011.  It is troubling that his two worst-performing jobs have occurred in the last three campaigns.

Overall, it is hard to sugar-coat this one.  This is an average Special Teams coordinator, who appears to have a few off seasons every now and then, the last of which likely led to his firing from the Bears.  However, that being said, it would be hard to argue that this is not an improvement (albeit a slight improvement) over what the Broncos have achieved in the recent past.

This is a textbook C+ type of move, and it will likely result in a middling special teams next year (and beyond, perhaps).  The thing is, with the talent across the rest of the roster, this may be all that John Elway and Kubiak want - a special teams that doesn't cost the team points.  DeCamillis may be a good coach to deliver just that, all while we allow above-average offense and defense to do the real work.

In addition, it worth noting that this was one of the guys that had the roof of Dallas' practice facility fall on him, which resulted in a severe injury to his neck (he had to have vertebrae fused, I believe).  Regardless, he was back on the field less than two weeks after the surgery in a neck brace with his usual rowdy behavior.  I mention this because he could definitely be the kind of guy that will provide that "kicking and screaming" mentality that has been missing.

tl;dr - Average guy - but maybe that's all the Broncos want.

edit: in the interest of fairness, if you go all the way back to his 10-year stint with the Atlanta Falcons (1997-2006), those teams averaged out at ranking 7th in the league (so, top quarter).  That was a while ago, though, so take that information as you see fit.  

 




 He was 100% a caretaker head coach, when Bowlen had to decide on an Elway vs. Reeves ultimatum.  He was actually fine as a head coach (.500 winning percentage over 2 seasons, plus one playoff loss), but he was always hired with the idea of holding the position until Shanahan was ready to leave San Francisco.

And yes, he was a worse HC than DC - this was also true at Buffalo and Dallas.  But, wherever he gets to focus on just the defense, he always fields a strong unit. 




 And if he does preside over the ascension of Bortles (Raise them!), I think that should put to bed the whole, "Only had success with Peyton Manning" style of criticism.  I wish him the best of luck, though. 




 Gibbs' zone-blocking scheme (ZBS) can be run with either 1 or 2 backs, with some slight adjustments for when both backs are in there (it adjusts the strongside/weakside designation, and especially alters blocking on the weakside, usually).  But, I think it is important to understand that a FB in the ZBS is not built to go put a hat on a Mike linebacker in the hole every play.  He is more in the Howard Griffith-style of back - can pass protect, can catch balls out of the backfield if needed, and can lead block (sometimes), and even can take those 1-yard plunges from an upback position.  I am not sure if that kind of player is currently on the roster, but I think the closest fit is probably Thompson, as you suggested, although I have not seen very much from him regarding pass protection and catching the ball (at least in the regular season).

edit:  If you want to learn so much about the ZBS that you'll consider quitting your job to go coach it at a local highschool or community college, check [this] (http://vimeo.com/cripes/videos/search:Alex/sort:date/format:thumbnail) out.

 Not a doctor (well, not that kind, anyway), but I think that the nature of Manning's injury was that it really only would heal via rest, and the rest required would have been longer than just the end of the regular season (sort of like Aaron Rodger's calf).  It's possible the options were :  1.  Sit Manning the rest of the year or 2. Play Manning the rest of the year.  No real in between. If 2 or 3 weeks of rest wouldn't actually accomplish anything - then why sit him at all?

Recall, also, that until the Cincinnati Bengals loss, the Broncos were still playing for the #1 seed in the AFC.

 I watched Brian Griese beat out Bubby Brister when Elway left.  People were all, "Wonderlic this" and "Michigan that" and the hype was huge.  And you know what?  He was fine.  He played well sometimes, but generally didn't perform well in the big games (which were almost always against you assholes back then).

I watched Plummer being instilled as the new answer, and I loved Plummer.  "No Mistake Jake" was the mantra around here - as long as he didn't force anything, we would be *fine*!  Even though Shanahan fucked it up, Plummer had a clear ceiling.

And Cutler.  That was probably the biggest hype I have ever seen for a new Broncos quarterback - even Shanahan fell into it, replacing Jake mid-season and easily costing us a playoff spot and Shanahan a job, eventually.  Don't get me started on Orton and Tebow.

These players all looked like they had potential, and I'd argue that only Plummer really put it all together for a strong season.  One strong season.  It is easy to get swept up in the hype, but there are not very many NFL-quality starting quarterbacks in this world.  Hopefully, the Lobster turns into that for us, but you never know.  I think the organization has done everything they can to stack the deck in their favor (having him study under Manning, but still compete for the backup role with various other QBs), and I have seen improvement in preseason play, but who knows? 




 It's wishful thinking.  We all hope that will be the case, but it is obviously completely up in the air.  If I were being honest, I'd say there is a 50% chance that Brock is a completely mediocre, replacement-level type player, a 40% chance that his is an above-average starting quarterback, a 8% chance that is the long-term solution at quarterback, and about a 2% chance that he ascends to the mysterious level of "elite".

You think I am being too optimistic? (honest question) 




 This logic is faultless.

**Faultless, I say!!!**

 Knew it was Borowski before I even clicked it.  I don't know if there has ever been a person with whom I could be in complete agreement (sometimes; not on everything) while completely disagree with her method of expressing those views.

 




 I would straight-up trade Peyton Manning for the #1 overall pick this year.  It is simply a question of value.  Manning adds a great deal of value to his team, but it will likely only be for another year (if that!).

By contrast, a number 1 pick will add much greater value *over the course of that player/player's career*.  Imagine the Broncos do this, and simply trade back for something reasonable (i.e., not what the Redskins did):  Swap 1sts this year with a team in the high single digits, plus next year's 1st rounder.

So, to recap:  Under this situation, I give up Peyton Manning, and I am left with:  The number 28 pick (Broncos), the 7-9th pick (traded for the #1 overall I received for Manning) this year, plus two more 1sts next year - at least one of which is probably top 15?

I love Manning, but no team would take that trade.  It just bleeds value. 




 Very possible.  Peyton and Gase seem to have a great relationship, and I like the idea of giving a Wunderkind-type coordinator his first shot at HC.

Thing is, that also describes Austin and Quinn (though they are on the other side of the ball, and have not built up the relationship with the Broncos organization).

Then there's Kubiak, who I think gets too much flak for his stint in Houston.  When Schaub was a respectable QB, that Houston team was very good.  It is not easy taking over a franchise which has literally zero history of success and establishing that new culture.

Personally, I think I would be quite pleased with Gase, Quinn, Austin, ot Kubiak, but would prefer Gase (if we go offensive) or Austin (if we go defensive). 




 That movie had such potential.  A very interesting world with a nice sci-fi concept to tie it together.

But, nope.  Bank Robberies for everyone! 




 Broncos have an interview set up for tomorrow with him, and I think that the Falcons have a 2nd interview today.

I hope he makes it to Denver to talk with Elway, at the very least. 




 By Grabthar's Hammer . . . What a savings. 




 You certainly do; there's a reasons that he is one of the only coaches left over from the McDaniels Era - he is very good at coaching running backs.  Studesville truly is a . . . hmm, what word am I looking for here?  I guess, "Pro". 




 I like Redmond because sometimes he plays alongside Barrie and I get to shout, "The Kubrick Pair is D-ing it up!!!" 




 Nah, $41.43 - because real cool dudes use two Twin Primes to make a price! 




 There's always money in the banana stand . . . 




 Maybe if I make a bottom 5 list . . . 




 Stream open; over-reactions to minor statements ready! 




 I got to thinking about this when everyone and their dog seemed to have an opinion on how good Fox really is, both here and in /r/nfl.  So, where, in your estimation, does John Fox rank among the other great coaches that have been at the helm of the Broncos?  Is he top 5, or somewhere below that?

I think Shanahan is heads-and-shoulders above the rest.  I know he looked iffy without Elway at QB, and that his teams would fade at the end of the season and always have trouble fielding a reasonable defense, but he coached at an elite level for a brief period, and was very good for most of the rest.  Easy #1.

I think the second spot has to go to Dan Reeves.  I know we lost three Superbowls and an AFC Championship game during his tenure.  I know he was far too conservative with Elway in his prime (a direct contrast to Shula with Marino), but the man won so many games, and had the Broncos competing for championships many times.  I don't think that can be overlooked.  Easy #2.

Now here's where it gets hard:  who is number 3:  John Fox or Red Miller?  I think they are the most comparable of the remaining coaches, and have had very similar success (Fox is .719, Miller .645; both have a single AFC Championship, both righted the ship when they arrived).  For my money, though, I am going to put Red Miller here.  He very deservedly won Coach of the Year in '77, and was really the first coach to establish the Broncos as a legitimate franchise.  It was amazing what he accomplished in that first year with Craig Morton at the helm, although the importance of the Orange Crush defense cannot be overstated.  By contrast, I think Fox benefited greatly from a miracle run by Tim Tebow , that Broncos defense, and amazing kicking from Prater (all of which was completely unsustainable), and then working with Peyton Manning.  I don't think Fox would have been successful taking over the '77 team, but I do think that Miller would have been fine taking over after McDaniels.

And, finally, to round out the top 5, I present the only other coach to have a winning record while coaching the Denver Broncos:  John Ralston (who went 34-33-3 over five years).  These Broncos teams were not good, but somehow Ralston was able to remain competitive regardless (Floyd Little helped, I'd imagine). He barely ekes out Wade Phillips due to longevity, a slightly better overall record, and the quality of talent available to him.

So, That leaves my list as:

1. Mike Shanahan
2. Dan Reeves
3. Red Miller
4. John Fox
5. Jon Ralston

Hon. Mention:  Wade Phillips (a much better DC than head coach, he still went exactly .500 in his career with Denver, and led us to a playoff appearance - which Ralston never did).

 




 I said this in jest to my wife last night (we're both UF alums who were there for both of his Gator Championships).  It really isn't *that* crazy of an idea, but I am pretty sure that he wants to build an entire program and have full control with recruiting and what not.  The college game is just so different, and now with the playoff system it is easier for an always-solid team to have a shot at the championship game most years (without a playoff system, the Buckeyes wouldn't have had a chance this year).  I also think he likes shifting the power away from the SEC, and he's doing very well in that regard. 




 Good call.  Fucked up all the way through, but eye stuff gets me especially. 




 Good news!  Got a bunch more of those for you:

 They both kind of work in a metaphorical sense, right?  "Whale" is attractive because whales are large and it suggests that you just dominate someone.  And "Wail" is nice because it means "a cry of anguish", which is exactly what you are forcing out of your hapless victim. 




 You don't protect yourself by crosschecking to the face.  You protect yourself (if that is your argument) by raising your gloves/arm/stick to your own face.  You know, turtling.  Like he does when he is getting beat down. 




 I always thought it was, "Wail on him".  

Regardless, totally in your camp.  Cooke is a goddamn disgrace.  It is slightly worse because they are down by 2 with ~2 to go.  Total bullshit enforcing, and he got walloped for it.  Fuck him.

 This is exactly it; he is average.  There was a piece (I think on Grantland) at the beginning of the year ranking coaches based on a survey sent to football people.  Fox was squarely in the second group - above average, not elite.

So, what is he good at?  I think the players like playing for him.  I think he handles the media well.  I think he has reasonable game plans (or at least trusts his coordinators to make decisions) - but nothing special.  He's not great at adjustments.  Awful at motivating players.  Absolutely awful at situational decisions (4th downs, being aggressive at end of halves, using time outs. **challenges!!!**)

He is an average coach, maybe slightly above average.  His ceiling is not very far from his floor, and he is certainly a stabilizing force.  This was precisely what the 4-12 Broncos needed after the McDaniels fiasco.  Now, with a strong core of players built over the last few years through strong drafts and key free agents (not just the big names, but folk like Chris Harris Jr. and CJ Anderson - both UFA), the ceiling on this team is high, and I think Fox's style conflicts with what this team can accomplish. 




 It is definitely a thing on all the Broncos blogs.  And we didn't even make it up - the Panthers did.  Ask the Panthers fans. 




 I think this is *a little* over-stated.  In my estimation, if you don't *play for* the Superbowl each season, it is a failure (meaning, reach the AFC Championship game, so you have a chance).  I mean, come on, anything can happen in a big playoff game like that - you just want your shot at the Superbowl.  The Broncos didn't even get that 3 of his 4 years (lost in divisional round @ NE, vs. BAL, vs. IND., which I think was a big part of this. 




 Correct.  And you don't exactly say to the Ravens, "Oh, I am waiting to see if the Broncos fire their coach which just won the division championship for his first four year before I decide if I want to OC for you guys!"   




 And yet, both coaches that you are referring to have developed a style so reviled that it inspires the creation of "insert name-ball".

Coincidence?  I think not.  There's no Carrolball or Belliball or even a Tomlinball. 




 This is really great!  As an assist for people to see what is going on under the hood (or, in essence, why you did each calculation), they can "follow along" with [this pdf] (http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips180-4/fips-180-4.pdf). 




 Thank you for the stats!

You are certainly correct - but I think the Colts were still just daring Manning to make the throws.  As your stats show, this year he has been above-average in making those throws.  I think it is fair to say that yesterday he was below average making those throws (and they *were* there, in that sequence where multiple throws went to Sanders, he had beat his man by at least a step).  Results?  Overthrow by 2 yards and overthrow by 0.5 yards. 




 Usually the head coach is made available to the media as well (recall last year when Fox and Elway had a presser after the Superbowl).  This tweet is suggesting that that omission means the Fox will be fired. 




 It was mentioned in his SI piece last week. 




 I do agree with you in principle, but there were opportunities to win the game.  You don't deserve the down votes! 




 This was an absolute choke job.  Only CJ Anderson showed up today.  Poor showings from the wide receivers, Peyton Manning, and much of the defense, especially on critical third downs.  Talib may have had his worst game as a Bronco.  Demaryius looked spooked most of the time.  The Colts decided to be physical 1-on-1 with receivers and we had zero answers.  This looked eerily similar to the Superbowl at times, and the Colts D is not the Seahawks D.  Disappointing.

This is now twice in three years that Fox and company have squandered a first round bye by losing to an underdog.  And the other year they were out-coached in the Superbowl and embarrassed.  I'd guess that people will be clamoring for Fox's job - but there aren't really reasonable alternatives in mind.  Staying pat for at least another year would be the best move; 4 division titles in 4 years is still an achievement to be proud of.

Good season, Broncos.  Always looking forward to next year, but this one leaves a nasty taste . . . 




 How close were we to kicking Tom Brady out of this game?  Holy shit  




 Interesting design - but I must say that I am a a little surprised that it is an open-air stadium.  It seems to me that all the owners who are a building new digs want to be able to host a Superbowl there in the near future, and I think the league would hesitate to have one in St. Louis in February.

Now, I know that New Jersey just had one, and I am actually supportive of the idea of having cold-weather Superbowls (Denver would be great - you could easily have a 50 degree, sunny day or -10 and a blizzard!), but I think it is folly to assume that because NJ had one, that this issue doesn't stick in the craws of some. 




 Amazon Prime has it.  Just in case you already have that thing. 




 Not only that - but did you read the article?  Very, very poor writing.  If I see another one-sentence paragraph which is completely related to the previous and next one-sentence paragraphs, then I will not be held accountable for my actions. 




 My day-to-day sanity has greatly improved since unsubbing from /r/politics and /r/atheism.

 




 Very, very sad.  Apparently he can't remember the Superbowl victories anymore. 




 It is amazing to me to think that Chris Harris Jr. was almost not given a chance in the NFL.  You can be aggressive and call him the best cornerback in football, or at least have him in the top 5, but I think everyone who follows football would put him in the top 10.

So, think of this:  how many players who are one of the top 10 at their position *almost didn't get any college free agent offers*?  That's amazing.

And then, to suffer one of these non-contact ligament injuries and recover so quickly?  The Broncos underpaid for Mr. Harris Jr. - He is something really special. 




 Lotsa people arguing about looks and pretty and girl next door and what not.

But when she sings, "Two bottle of whiskey for the way.  And I sure would like some sweet company, and I'm leaving tomorrow, what'd'ya say?" I have only one question:

What.  Fucking. Train? 




 I'll look for it in earnest tomorrow.

Also, obviously Tebow was a rollercoaster for everyone involved.  You know we lost 7-3 against the Chiefs **at home** the week before various miracles won us that WC game?  That's just not a healthy way to live . . . 




 You ever see the article/gif explaining how something like 4 defensive players completely shit the bed on that play, simultaneously?  Was hilarious.

Go Tebow.

Edit:  Oh, and Bubby Brister can't field a shotgun snap in the playoffs, bit he's good enough to backup Elway.

Edit 2:  But not good enough to beat out Brian Griese for a job. 




 So hard. 




 AFC West plays AFC North next year.  So he's at least good for a 90-yard run against the Steelers. 




 Good luck, buddy. I would seriously consider switching fandom if my team picked him #1. 




 If I walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, would you call it a duck?

Similar thing going on here.  Some people are very willing to call "duck", and some think there isn't enough information available. 




 Here's a game:  I'll set the Over/Under on Career Playoff wins for Manziel at 0.5.

Whatcha want? 




 Elway is so good. 




 I'm sure they'll have plenty more opportunities to look the other way. 




 Exactly!  You have to make sure you mispronounce it in some way which vaguely suggests that you are subconsciously harboring some deep-seeded racism.

We also would accept, "Scrong", "Stronk", and "Scarong".  




 Good work, this is how one answers a direct question.

Now go fuck yourself you dirty Patriot fan.

 Here's something that I am looking at for this game:  Red Zone efficiency.

The Seattle defense is at the top of many statistical categories, but one in which they are deficient is opponent touchdown percentage in red zone.  [Here] (http://www.teamrankings.com/nfl/stat/opponent-red-zone-scoring-pct) you can see that the Seahawks are 26th in the league here (granted, the Panthers are worse, but that isn't the point).  IF the Panthers can convert red zone opportunities into touchdowns, instead of field goals, they have a very good chance.  I mean, this is kind of one of those obvious coach-speak cliches, but I bring it up because it seems to me that the greatest weakness of the Seattle Defense is in this portion of the field - so you need to take advantage of that to beat them. 




 I think I would put a lot of money on this game being closer than at least one game this weekend.  This is just someone looking at the point spread / records, glorifying the Seahawks (particularly their offense, which is situationally good, at best), and moving on to the other, more "interesting" games.

 




 We're going to need some more of this come Saturday.

Here's an interesting question:  who has more rushing yards at the end of the game:  Stewart or Lynch? 




 I remember jumping out of my seat from that hit, scaring the shit out of the cat.

 




 I've got the Carolina Panthers covered.

Since my wife is from Charlotte, and still has family there, we went to the game two years ago when the Broncos were in town (we planned on being there for the long Veteran's day weekend anyway, and completely lucked into the game being the same weekend).  So, it was me, in my Von Miller orange jersey, my wife in some normal Broncos shirt covered by her coat, and her father in normal, non-affiliated clothes.  We started off in a Broncos tailgate where the guys in charge were home-brewers and offered us tastes of all of their beers, which was awesome.  We got a little light razzing a couple of times outside of the stadium, but nothing too serious (this was the year before the Panthers won the division, and Cam was struggling). 

Even once we sat down and the game started, everyone was really, really nice.  I was slightly obnoxious as Von sacked Cam 1-on-1 from a "spy" position, stuffed him for losses on QB-keepers, but no one really cared.  In fact, as Cam continued to struggle, there were many cries of, "Scam Newton!" and the like.  Overall, we ran away with the game, but nothing was ever heated at all.  I even high-fived a dude when De'angelo Williams scored a touchdown because we both had him in fantasy!  Very cool people.  My experience at this game, coupled with my recurring visits to Charlotte have led to my adoption of the Panthers as my NFC team.  Needless to say, I am a huge Panthers fan this weekend.  Obviously, should the Panthers meet the Broncos in the Superbowl, my allegiances will lie with our shade of blue.  But, there is no team I'd rather lose to more than the Panthers this year.

 




 Ice Bowl will be on after that! 




 It  is on again next (right now is Cowboys vs Packers NFC Championship game before superbowl XXX)!
