 Kale. All of the kale. I buy it frozen and put it in soups, stir fries, smoothies, etc... Also, garlic and spices as flavoring and I refuse to buy junk food. I don't have much of a sweet tooth, but frozen grapes are a great alternative to popsicles and ice cream. 




 All in good fun ;) 




 Poutine fucking rocks. 




 I am prescribed Adderall. 




 Ha, that is pretty awesome, considering I'm a Jew. 




 Playing devil's advocate... I can understand her question, but that doesn't make the question at all okay. If she was dressed provocatively, sure, she is more at risk of harassment... Should she be harassed REGARDLESS of what she is wearing? Abso-fucking-loutely not. I would be pissed, too, but I'd see it as an opportunity to educate your girlfriend on why that kind of thinking perpetuates that kind of problem rather than just getting confrontational. 




 Tell the difference between "should of" and "should have" 




 My mother is bipolar and an alcoholic. She abused me growing up until I was 14 and reported her to my therapist. I went into the state's custody and bounced around from home to home. It was hell and I was completely fucked up from it but I became stronger as a result and after a LOT of hard work and seeking therapy/medication/help and not holding grudges or pointing fingers, I'm starting to really like who I've become. It isn't easy because I'm a very sensitive person and certain comments and events will trigger knee-jerk reactions where I can act emotionally or get angry at someones insensitivity but I think if I didn't persevere, I'd be a completely different and much sadder person...

 It shouldn't if your using the right stuff! Try making a conditioning mask that you leave in your hair... Perhaps a raw honey and avocado mask left in your hair for a few hours will help. 




 I meet amazing people all the time just by being open and not intrusive.... Just the other night I met someone who I talked to for 3 hours and he told me "I'm telling you things I don't even tell my closest friends!"
I just am really open, honest and curious about people and what they do or what makes them tick, so asking about their life and being genuine has always been what works for me. 
I also draw or write whenever I sit at a bar, which usually instigates people to inquire what I'm doing and it just kind of goes from there... 




 Believe it or not, tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, etc are all fruits, despite being regarded as veggies. 
Vegetables are basically lettuces, root vegetables like carrots, etc as their seeds aren't contained/protected by the fruit (save for a few examples like strawberries where the seeds are outside) 




 It's $28 for 4 fl. oz... I believe $90 is for the 16 oz.

e: It's so dense and rich that it really only requires a small amount of conditioner. I used to use it when I got it for free when I worked in body care and it made my hair feel like bunny rabbit hair. It is amazing. 




 I doubt it will affect you any differently besides psychologically... If you're worried about it when you take lsd, you're probably going to really worry about it when you're tripping which could cause you to have a bad trip 




 [This is pretty great, albeit expensive...](http://www.johnmasters.com/hr.htm)

Also, try not shampooing your hair except for once a week or less, and only using conditioner. You can rinse your hair with raw apple cider vinegar (1 tablespoon to 1 cup water) and massage it into your hair and let it sit for a few minutes, rinse with water and apply conditioner... Shampoo strips your hair of natural oils which causes your scalp to try to compensate for the lost oils and also the shampoo just dries out your hair follicles...

 Tetsuo: the iron man? 




 My father was arrested in 1988 for being the leader of an Israeli cocaine ring. I think the story about his lifestyle and subsequent arrest would make an interesting story. My mom was also a model and a bipolar alcoholic and I ended up in foster care after 14 years of abuse and witnessed a lot of fucked up stuff in the system... I've always joked how cool it would be as a movie/documentary, even though growing up really sucked...

 Awww, the poor little guy! I genuinely think, while a lot of cats don't form emotional bonds to their owners in the way that people assume dogs do, cats that have gone through significant trauma and were rescued really are capable of recognizing it. I think it's cute that you gave him his tail and he tried to get cleaned up for you. You're a good cat mom!  




 What a pretty cat! Do you know her/his breed?

 He is doing very well! He was 9 pounds at his sickest and now he is a healthy 13 pounds (which for his size is appropriate). He also never meowed or made eye contact when he was at his sickest but now he is quite talkative and is a big happy goofball :)

 Yep! I remember refusing to participate in swim class in high school and my gym teacher made me do laps walking around the pool. He also gave me a VHS of [My First Mister](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E24SGpVrs-s) because the girl in it reminded him of me. In retrospect, it was kind of creepy that he put that much thought into it, and the title is kind of wtf. 




 Note the fanny pack in the first photo... I don't even know what to say about those earrings, either. Heh, I remember he used to joke around and wear my **scrunchies** and jokingly call himself "Tina" in order to mess with my cousin and me... How he turned out to be a *relatively normal* human being is beyond me.

He also was diagnosed with [vitiligo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitiligo) when he was a freshman in high school. He used to get picked on a lot because he wore makeup to cover the blotches. He was able to stop the progression of it by doing radiation, I believe. By the time he graduated, he was one of the most popular kids in high school. Complete 180. 




 I thought it would never happen. I still feel like that frumpy little girl who got picked on constantly... Thank you!  




 Thank you! :)

 Awesome, thank you! High west campfire is great. Rye is my favorite of the spirits so this is really awesome advice, thanks! 




 Thanks a bunch! This is good information :) 




 Haha this is a fantastic response. You hit the nail on the head with your assessment. I always prefer rye for my manhattans and scotch to sip. I'll have to think of a few more options because I'm not fond of very "sweet" whiskeys so I appreciate the direction to focus on :D 




 Thank you so much! This is incredibly helpful! I've tried quite a few, but honestly ony can remember about one or two from most categories as I wasn't drinking them with the intention of selling it, heh. I really appreciate the feedback and will keep it in mind until I have my own go-to's as ammunition :) 




 Hey all!

I just got a new job as a cocktail waitress at a bar specializing in whiskey/whisky... A lot of patrons will ask for suggestions on recommendations for a good bourbon/scotch/rye of varying conditions/batches/etc.

I was curious what r/whiskey thought about some solid go-to's and why.

[Here is the full spirits list for anyone curious.](http://www.saloondavis.com/documents/Saloon_Bourbon8.9.13.pdf) It changes often, so anything outside of this is encouraged, too, but try to stick to the list if you can :)

Thanks!

I am going into the bar before they open today to do a little practice. I'll report back after. Thanks a bunch! 




 Awesome advice, thank you!!! 




 The bar is more upscale than that, which is why I'm intimidated...

 Thank you! This is a great help!

Also, how do bartenders usually memorize so many drinks? Do you normally study it when first starting out or did a lot of it come with practice?  




 Great job! 




 This comes off more creepy and stalkerish than awesome. I feel bad for celebrities sometimes. Cool photo either way, OP. Workaholics is great... Maybe next time take a mental picture when you're in a situation like that? 




 So, I just started a new job as a hostess at a local restaurant and not even a week in I was asked if I would be interested in cocktail waitressing. I have server experience and a really great analytical memory, so I enthusiastically agreed... Cut to yesterday, I show up for my shift and was pulled aside from the (lead?) bartender and asked if I was interested in bartending. I was honest about my lack of experience which he seemed fine with (he said he prefers training new bartenders over acclimating existing bartenders with attitudes). I am heading in on Sunday to do a little training and I'm extremely nervous. I've been in myriad positions where I've had to learn on the fly, and the staff seems to really like me here but I can't help but feel like they're insane for asking me two weeks into my new job.  
  

Any help or advice on how to kick ass and learn fast would be appreciated, along with any useful tips that any new bartender should know. There's a possibility this is just a trial run and won't end up with an actual bar position, but I want to be prepared for all possible outcomes.  
  


**TL;DR:** I was asked if I wanted to be a bartender with no previous bartending experience because my managers think I am organized and a fast learner (I presume). Please help with tips/opinions in any way!  
  

Thanks for reading :) 




 Seriously, you have helped me get through SO many shitty days at my horrible job. I put a post-it on my desk that says "You didn't get mauled by a bear. You can get through this day!!!"

At that point, I figured "fuck it" and I walked back and said "yeah, I do. I can't believe you asked me that, but whatever. I'm not ashamed." He was surprised I answered, but I'd rather come off as confident than have them make up their own stories for what I choose to do in my personal life. *shrug* 




 Yesterday, I got two...

* You look hot! Like a power lesbian or something...

I work in a bar, so I get a lot of weird comments and compliments from drunk people.

Also, you're a babe. 




 Well excuuuuuuuuse me, princess! 




 I'll post more in the comments as I continue to write this out. I just really need to get this out somewhere... I apologize for my crappy writing skills.  


Its been a long time since Ive openly written about what my life was like growing up.  A part of me has been putting it off because Im not sure how vividly I remember it but despite the amount of time Ive had to move past it, I am still affected by it somewhat regularly.  


First off, a little backstory may help:  
Before I was born, my mother was married to an Israeli man. I have an older brother who was born in 1986. I am not sure how long she had been with my father prior to that, but I was born two years later.
My mother was a model in the eighties. Nothing noteworthy, but from what I gather, she did well for herself. She was a beautiful woman and met my father through a friend of hers. My father was a wealthy businessman who owned a limousine service and invested in a few local restaurants. My father had property in NY and MA; possibly more, but I am not certain.  
In 1988, my father was arrested for drug charges that pointed to him as the leader of a Brookline cocaine ring. Based on the legal documents I could find, he had been responsible for trafficking somewhere in the realm of 350 kilos of cocaine from 1986 to 1988 and was sentenced to 30 years in federal prison.  


Growing up, I didnt know my father. I knew of him through idle mention, but my mother had already settled down with a new man during my infancy. As far as I was concerned, my stepfather David was whom I called daddy. Growing up, I remember him as a very good father- he was goofy, loving, supportive, etc. He was the co-owner of a motel in Old Orchard Beach, Maine where we would spend the majority of our summers. My childhood seemed pretty great in a general sense- I was provided food, shelter, and often, love. From an early age, however, my parents fought a lot. I used to be a pretty happy and outgoing toddler, but there was often fighting in the home that my brother and I would bear witness to.  
I suppose I should preface that mother is bipolar. Being the youngest and most sensitive child, I was often subjected to psychological, physical and emotional abuse at the hands of my mother. Children are inherently needy; they rely on their parents to be a support system during their upbringing and, while I was provided with a lot of love and great experiences growing up, there was an insidious darkness in our home that grew steadily over time.  


To summarize what life was like growing up, here are a few memories I have, both good and bad, in as close to chronological order as my memory will allow.  

* 	My mother used to sing songs to me while running her nails through my hair as I fell asleep. I often asked her to sing me sad songs because from an early age, I was all too familiar with crying myself to sleep (and the deep comfort it brought)


*	My mother threw wonderful, extravagant Christmas parties for her friends that were always such a joy to participate in. The preparation it took prior, however, weighed on her and she often took it out on my brother and me. One vivid memory I have was of her slapping me and shoving my face into a cookie wrapper I left on my bedroom floor; she shamed me like an owner shames their dog for having an accident.


*	If I wasnt polite or if I spoke out of line, I would be smacked on the mouth and shamed into submission. My aunt recalls a time that she took me into the city during one of her visits; she said that I waited for her at the door with my little suitcase packed and refused to leave the doorway. She bought me a stuffed Pumba doll from the Disney store and when I came home, I insisted that it was okay that I had it because it was on sale and that I wasnt a burden and/or hadnt coaxed my aunt into buying me frivolous things.


* 	One time, my mother stabbed my stepdad with a steak knife. My brother, stepdad and I spent the night in a motel and he called us out of school the next day. I dont remember much, but I remember sitting in silence in his car in the rain while he thought about what to do. We returned home the next day.


*	In middle school, I remember my mother beating me and mocking/shaming me particularly bad. I was already picked on pretty bad in school and didnt want to show up puffy faced and disheveled, so I skipped school and instead hid in our family van. Since I didnt have a watch, I returned home at what I thought was an appropriate time, only to be berated further.


*	Some nights, when I couldnt sleep, my mother and I used to dance to Roy Orbison records in our pajamas until I was tired. 


*	During thunder storms, my mother allowed my brother and me to draw on all of the mirrors and windows with washable markers.


* 	My mom was amazing at sewing and often created our Halloween costumes, wedding clothes, holiday garb, etc. from scratch. The house was always decorated beautifully for holidays, and my mother made the most creative Easter baskets, threw the most fun Easter egg hunts, etc. 


	When my mother was a good mom, she was the best. When she was bad mom, she really made life a living hell. My stepdad is the kind of man that secretly needs a woman to bully or control him. I spent my whole childhood believing that it was normal for my dad to sleep on the couch downstairs. He did his best to protect me when he was home and I always idolized him as my protector and my best friend. Despite his aloof urgings, I was still subjected to consistent, sporadic shaming, beatings, mockery and threats. My own mother would get drunk nightly and call me a cunt; I was told that I was a loser, unwanted, a drama queen, etc. on a too-regular basis. The mother I loved was the living embodiment of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. For fourteen years, I familiarized my beautiful mother as the volatile monster, dormant only when she was left alone to sit in the pantry and chain smoke cigarettes and binge on Coors Light. 


	After fourteen years and countless character and body shaming, physical and psychological beatings, and having to carry my mother to bed drunk, my mother kicked my stepdad out. Loud fights, name-calling and character bashing were a nightly occurrence and my stepdad just endured the abuse like a prisoner afflicted with Stockholm syndrome. It was less than a week later that I followed; I had confessed to my therapist that my mother had beaten me pretty badly on our staircase (the first confession I outwardly made to my therapist, or anyone else, in fourteen years). I was sick of being treated like garbage, and since my stepfather was gone, the abuse only got worse. I remember so vividly the moment my therapist, Gerarda, asked me if I was certain that I wanted to make such a claim, because it would change my life forever. I told her I was, but I had no idea how much my life would change from there.

I tried to tell a guy who was wearing a shirt with a clownfish on it at a bar that it was a great way to pickup ladies... All you have to do is correlate it to the equivalent of "chicks are the better, dominant gender in some species" or some stupid shit...

ps: I am a female. I am also an ass at bars, though.

 One of my best friends almost died from lupus. Her story is so sad. She is better now, but she has to be really careful lest flare-ups happen. She broke out in terrible hives when we were in Spain together and her throat almost closed up. It was really scary being in a country where none of us knew much of the language during a situation such as that.

 The thesaurus is a great source! Any smartphone has a thesaurus in conjunction with the dictionary app. Type in a word, find something similar.  

My favorite word is "absolutely". It may seem silly and common, but the use of absolutely in place of "sure" or "no problem" comes of so much more eloquent. 




 Depression/suicide awareness. I feel like so many people are depressed but so few people have the tact or understanding to be a supportive friend to someone struggling with depression. So many people give advice but usually all someone wants is to *not* talk or think about their issues. That's what a therapist is for. We just want to be distracted as a way to be cheered up.  

Also, eating disorders. There isn't a whole lot of understanding with the kind of addiction and struggle that ED sufferers endure. A lot of people think it's about vanity when it very rarely is, or, if it started out that way, it never is the reason for persisting.

 There's a restaurant in Canada called "Signs" that is an all deaf staff where sign language is mandatory for ordering. You could probably work there even if you weren't deaf, I'm sure... 




 Even better: "What do they mean?!" 




 Hahaha, true story. I worked as a travel assistant in a call center that sold tour packages to American seniors. I chatted for a good hour with this guy's father! Dude was hilarious and so proud of his kids! 




 Honestly wasn't expecting the comment to get noticed, let alone be so popular, haha. 




 Ugh, thank you for referencing Big Mama! I feel like nobody knows her and it's tragic because she's *fucking awesome*! 




 Right there with you. It's a blessing and a curse, damn it! 




 Yeah, if it becomes a massive string it can be a little cumbersome. 




 Night mode is pretty rad. I should probably do that for my eyeballs sake. 




 So many different platforms I'm learning about! 




 Well it's not *too far* from the truth.  




 Ha, well based on everyone elses response, it seems like I'm not the only one. But, you know, it's cool if you feel that way. 




 I had people trying to get me on reddit for about three years. Now I have no life. 




 I'll agree with you there. I've gotten to liking the layout in a lot more ways than I initially thought, but there are still flaws that sometimes keep me from commenting/participating. 




 I refuse to download any platforms for reddit. I already waste too much time here 




 That sounds awful! 




 Yeah, it takes time. Now that I'm used to it, I actually quite like the layout. 




 Yeah, I feel you there... I spend WAY too much of my time on here. 




 I was coaxed into trying SomethingAwful and used to browse it regularly. It got kind of boring and I ditched any type of forums for a while. Eventually, friends of mine kept forwarding funny/interesting threads and I decided I'd give it a fair shot. Still hooked. 




 Touch 




 Hahaha, at least you kept trying! Dr. Pepper is huge in Texas. 




 That's fair. I can agree with that. 




 Haha, yeah but for some reason men think the same thing. When I specifically try to give off the "just being friendly, not interested in dating, but you're cool, bro." vibe, a lot of men take it as playing hard to get.  




 Yeah, gay men seem to have no problem flirting with women and women definitely tend to be okay with it. I think it's just "fun" for the guys and "safe" for the women. 




 They'd be more likely to have an orgy if they're **all** gay, don't you think? I guess I would consider myself straight because I pretty much only date men, but I enjoy sleeping with women. I prefer not to consider myself any particular sexuality because it's not really that black and white, though. Pansexual? haha... 




 Ah, I used to work in a cubicle. That shit would *not fly* there! 




 Thanks for pointing that out! Derp. I work at a bar. There's really no such thing as harassment in bars. I mean, obviously *there is*, but we're all pretty open with being weird and inappropriate. It's best to just roll with it rather than get all uptight. 




 Eh, I don't think so. We're just very open about our sexuality/sex lives at work. Restaurants and bars are pretty inappropriate by normal job standards. 




 Nope. I have long hair! It was a lady coworker that said that one to me, haha. 




 I would love it if that song played in the background every time I had to tell a drunk idiot to please get the hell out of my way while I'm carrying 5 manhattans.

 Any help would be appreciated... Or suggestions on a sub/website where I can post this and get the answers I'm looking for?

 Thank you! This is actually very helpful. 




 Like, when something he says or does causes me to get anxious and I ask him to watch his tone of voice because it's stressing me out, he'll change his inflection to sound pleading/frustrated about what he did wrong, as well as gesticulate with his hands and it stresses me out more and just causes me to shut down more and idk how to explain to him that it's not unheard of for people who've suffered abuse to be hyper vigilant to body language... Does that make sense? 




 No need to apologize. Thank you for the suggestion :) 




 PLEASE do the world a favor and report this to the police, OP. 




 I can really relate to this, too. 




 Yep. This is about where I am. Depression turned to apathy/laziness, then I had an accident at work and hit my head on the stairs and now I'm just angry and want to die

 Well, I don't bartend... I am just a cocktail waitress. I really like it though! I get to talk to cool and interesting people, I get to have fun with my coworkers and I get to be myself! 




 It's weird, but after years of interacting with people, you just kind of *can* by hearing what someone says and by their body language just kind of knowing what it is they want.. Mind you, I work at a bar so I have gotten really good at remembering orders based on the "type" of person and repeating their order back to them. Usually I can remember orders for up to ten people and even remember what they got long after.... Now, names on the other hand are a completely different issue... 




 Damn good taste, dude!!! I usually drown my sorrows at a bar so I'm not "alone" but that's a great lineup you have so... Kudos? Sorry you're going through that, though :-/

 I would think it'd be a congregation of dentists... 




 That's relieving but I'm still pretty concerned it could become complicated. The hole is deeper than the photo suggests. It's about the size of my pinky fingernail... What type of tissue defect could it possibly be? It also looks like there is bone exposed; there is whiteness inside the hole and this hole definitely wasn't there before :x 




 This is the only place where it's possible to have a plane fly over a car driving over a train riding over a boat all at the same time! 




 Sorry, I guess I misunderstood... Since the images were hosted on the artist's own site with no ads, wouldn't that qualify? 









 Oh gosh. I'm guessing you're either a firefighter or an EMT?  




 Yikes, what a jarring scene that must've been! 




 I was living with my aunt, uncle and their two kids (8   10) when I was 14. I was recently put into the state's custody because my mom was an abusive alcoholic. My uncle and his family were kind enough to take me in. I was there for four months when in June, the day before my last day of freshman year in high school he just... suddenly froze up in his chair and reached for my aunt (she and I were standing right there talking to him as he was complaining about "heartburn"). It was terrifying; my aunt yelled for me to call 911 but I couldn't move.... That's when his sons came downstairs and made the situation even tougher- they kept asking their dad to wake up. I ended up having to take them to a neighbor's house when the EMT's arrived. I found out later that night that he was pronounced dead on the scene. The wake was very strange to experience. 




 No matter how old they are, it's always sad. I think I was more torn up having my nana die than I was when I saw my uncle suddenly drop dead of a heart attack at 51... I was 14. 




 I kind of became numb to it, too... I know that feeling :-/ 




 It's still very sad! 




 Yeah, especially when it's unexpected. Eery... 




 What the fuck? 




 Witnessing someone die in front of you... 




 Sorry to hear that happened to you. The foster care system in the states is abysmal. Sadly, I understand why, though... Over worked, underpaid social workers and thankless families giving them hell. Plenty of my foster parents only took me in for the money. Glad to hear you got your life in order, though! I can say I definitely learned fast how to advocate for myself and it's worked well for me still. Take shit from no one! 




 Damn great job ya did there!!!

I work at a bar and my managers get annoyed because I never carry an apron or a pad of paper. I can remember up to 10 orders without needing to bother writing them down. It impresses the guest and it saves me time.

 Wow, you have such an amazing body! I'm envious! :) 




 Thank you! :) 




 We usually try to keep all our kitchen gadgets unplugged when they're not in use 




 zero, I suppose. I didn't even use a flame, I just kept a steady flow of hot running water on it. Though, you can totally use a crockpot on low for simmering bones, too! 




 Never ever thinkin' there was trouble in the water they were drinkin', they just guzzled it down 




 I had to work the rest of my shift so I left it simmering in hot water for a few hours (not boiling though!). I put it in a to-go box and carried it home in my bag and immediately left it outside to dry and let bugs pick off any extra flesh. I work as a cocktail waitress so I kind of just dicked around on my shift since it was slow anyway. 




 Oh! I work at a restaurant in the boston area. They had a whole pig roast and I had to work the day of my birthday so I asked them to let me have the skull. I cleaned it out during my shift and brought it home with me. 




 Thank you! :)

 Thank you SO much! Is there anything I can do for you?? 




 Thank you! Is there anything I can make for you??? 




 Thank you! You are very sweet :') 




 Thank you so much! What would you like created for you? Literally anything you want! 




 That's more than I could ever expect! Do you want any art or a thank you note with a sketch? 




 Thank you so much! That's more than I could ever expect from a generous stranger! Do you want a drawing or a thankyou note? 




 It's everydayshea at gmail dot com... It's vaguely mentioned on one of my screencaps. Sorry I didn't make it clear :-/ 




 Thank you so much! Everyone's been so kind and I've already teared up so many times today. You're awesome; your kind words mean so much to me. 3 




 That sounds amazing! Let's do it :) 




 Sure, let's do it! 




 Perfect. What days work for you, usually? I'm out of work at the very least until thursday still.. maybe longer so I have time besides the odd favors I'll do for friends in order to keep myself from going crazy or in exchange for a meal. I like cooking lots of things so you tell me whatever your favorite dish is and I'm happy to cook it! Feel free to PM me any time whenever you know what days work for you. 3 




 Thank you so much! Is there anything I can do for you in terms or art/a letter/a sketch??? I will definitely pay it forward. The funny thing is I try to do RAoK's as often as possible in hopes that good karma will be infectious to others. I can't thank you enough. :') 




 That's very sweet of you! How about I cook for you if you pick up the ingredients? :) 




 Oh gosh, I didn't realize... Fixed. Thank you! What can I do for you??? 




 I do not... I'm actually asking reddit because I'm too ashamed to let my colleagues and my boyfriend know I need help. It's a psychological crutch; I was abused growing up and made to feel like I didn't deserve anyone's help and that it's shameful to admit you need it. I don't know why, but auctioning my art to strangers feels so much emotionally safer. I have a paypal account, but I don't even know how to set up a gofundme... Maybe I'm just being pathetic. I also unloaded a LOT of info on my thread and I don't want to inundate anyone any more than I already have... 

Thank you so much for your kind words, though. I've been struggling for months and now with the health issues, it's all kind of bubbled over.  




 I just made one. I don't want to seem greedy so these are the most important things I could think of to help me get by...  
[http://amzn.com/w/1H1YLKSDB4QL9](http://amzn.com/w/1H1YLKSDB4QL9) 




 I do not, but I can make a new one! That one was on paper but I can do it on a clay aquaboard for better presentation if you want... Or I can do paper and frame it in a goodwill frame for you. 




 The trees with the stars are sold but I can make another similar yet different one. I can attempt nautical stuff... I love drawing sperm whales, squids, octopus, nautulus, etc... I will PM you. 




 No... I don't really need stuff. Cat food and litter, I guess, or winter shoes but I can figure out how to make one. I guess new paints so I can keep selling art wouldn't hurt but I don't want to be greedy. I'm not used to asking for help. 




 Aww I love cavaliers! Poor little thing, she looks so sad! Hope she heals up quickly 3 




 I can give you the bird; that one I still have! I stupidly cleaned off the spilling because I was being hard on myself and ended up making it have an orange background.. You are welcome to have it anyway, though. Other than that I can make you a cat if you'd prefer! I gifted the fat cat to an old room mate for holding onto a sentimental piece of furniture that I sold years back but I love drawing cats and am always happy to do more :) 




 We can meet up but I will probably be an embarrassed lump of sorry's and thank-you's and tears. When I'm confident I'm a good conversationalist and friend but when I'm embarrassed and mad at myself I can be a little pathetic. I'd love to meet a new friend, even if it means getting out of the house for a walk and cat food... I guess I just didn't expect anyone to respond. I'll pm you... You are a sweetheart. 




 Also, what is your favorite animal? If we do meet up it want to have something for you...  




 How flexible are your hours? You can always try volunteering on an organic farm in exchange for a free place to stay and three meals... The only thing is it depends on whether you can handle it. Most farms ask for 5 days/5 hour commitment... You can check out WOOFING (worldwide opportunities on organic farms) to see what might work for you! Otherwise, couchsurfing or air bnb may be good starts... Good luck :) 




 I don't even know how to ask for it. I made this at 4am. I guess the most important thing I honestly need is cat food and cat litter right now. I'm more worried about taking care of him than myself. I still have some ramen packets I can get by on for a bit. Gosh I'm embarrassed. 




 This made me cry. We need more kindhearted, patient people in this world. Even just making eye contact and smiling at your bus driver or a passerby might make their day even an iota brighter.  




 This breaks my heart :(  
OP you should have joined him... 




 Well good luck! I am a terrible night owl and I used to work at a coffee shop at 5am; sometimes I wouldn't go to bed until 2am only to wakeup at 4... Woof. Do you work at a grocery store or something? 




 Thank you so much! Do you have a favorite animal?  

Also, thank you for all the hard work you do. I hated my social worker when I was a ward of the state, but I recognize how overworked and under appreciated social workers are. Thank you for even choosing/attempting that career path. Try not to burn out; you may change someone's life more profoundly than they care to admit. 




 Voted. Good luck!! 




 **Edit:** I feel like I've received enough kindness from the wonderful users of reddit to close this. Thank you to every kind person who donated, offered advice, kind words, or commissioned me. I'm currently working on art for all of the redditors who donated/comissioned. I will be PMing you all directly with a photo of the progress/finished piece and we'll work out how to get in in your hands directly!   

For anyone curious, [here is my art on tumblr](http://faunus-crypticus.tumblr.com). I'm always happy to take commissions or barter; just keep in mind I have about 4 out 5 paintings that need to be finished first, so it may take a few days - week before I can take on anything new.  

**Thanks again to everyone; I plan on paying it forward as often as I can in any way, shape or form. You all have touched me very profoundly with your kindness.

 Fellow night owl here. How did your sleep adjustment go? 




 I'm in southie fairly often and will keep my eyes out. I saw the posters by Broadway. Good luck, I know how stressful a missing kitty is!

 Wow, that's a pretty depressing song to hear at a job like subway...  
*"So no one told you life was gonna be this way;  
your job's a joke, you're broke, your love life's DOA"* 




 No idea but it's getting to be really old. People felt "betrayed" by the beloved Unidan. 




 Jeez, 10 is a LOT when tipping isn't a common practice, too! 




 Worked every time for me, but you really need to genuinely mean it:   
"I don't need this job, I like my current job and am comfortable enough there; I just really want to work for this company" 




 Quit being butthurt, get over the whole Unidan thing and move on. 




 I work at a bar as a cocktail waitress and one thing I absolutely **hate** is when coworkers complain about their tables/tips/etc... You have *one job* and you can't at least keep a good attitude? Just because you aren't always a bitch to the tables doesn't mean we want to hear you bitching. It's just gonna make your own day worse anyway.  




 [Got the movie it's sourced from right here :D](http://youtu.be/FRoAz5eT1HA) 




 Brilliantly done! So clean! 









 What did you say to the guy after he bit you? I'm curious how your reacted! 




 Oh my god!!! I love this, haha. He looks so beaten down by life.  
*"I don't know, man... I've... I've seen some shit."*  
Thank you so much! 




 I'm surrounded by assholes! 




 Just watched that movie a few nights ago! It's a classic! :) 
























 My own fear of failure. I feel like I'd rather not try than try and fail, it seems... 




 Oh wow this would definitely take a lot of stress off someone's shoulders. I know it would for me, for sure. 




 This is awesome. You're a great person for encouraging this texter as well. You even told them about accent walls! Fuck yeah! Their babygirl is gonna have her blue room, fuck D!

 Thank you! These are all very helpful! I do have experience painting digitally but it's mostly cartoon stuff. I'm not very confident about making money with my art, sadly. You can check some of it out at http://faunus-crypticus.tumblr.com if you're curious, though! 




 I'm actually planning on registering for WWOOFing and have even emailed some farms as a start! That is exactly up my alley, though idk how I'd work out paying off bills while I volunteer. I'm sure I could sublet my apartment but I'd need to have some sort of income while I do it as I don't have and disposable income currently.  




 Oh, I don't have to leave the country; I just want to leave here. I don't think the military would be a good fit for me, however. I more just want to look into moving into the wilderness and maybe do WWOOFing or something :) 




 I saw this on her Instagram! Great work, can't wait to see the finished piece!  




 Hey there. I just discovered this sub and I'm not really sure how exactly I can change my life but I'm looking for any and all advice/help in getting things together.  

First a little history:  

 I grew up never really knowing what home was. I was abused, put into the foster care system and bounced around from 14-18. Never really knew anything about my father until I was 16 and reached out to him.  

My mom is a third generation American (Irish) and my father is an Israeli (his mother was born in Yemen, from what I understand). I grew up poor and without anyone teaching me how to be self sufficient. I had to learn all of that the hard way. From what I understand, my father was wealthy until he was arrested in 1988 for drug trafficking (he was the head of a local cocaine ring) and left us with nothing (the government seized everything and my mom tried to bribe him so he severed completely with the hopes that we would contact him later in life).  

Basically, for me, I just want to run away. I'm sick of the life I have and I've often dreamed of just getting out and living somewhere I can just garden, hunt, fish and live in the wilderness away from most people. I'm sick of having my income go mostly to keeping a roof over my head and bills, yet still not being able to afford to pay off my debt because I practically break even every month.  

The catch is that I don't have the skills to really live off the land and want so badly to be taken on as someone's apprentice (so to speak). I want to learn it all. I want to get out of the city and work my way up to being completely self sufficient. I'm at the point where I want to just drop everything and walk away from my life. I virtually want to commit suicide of my former self and just find the happy, free person that is dying to get out.  

Maybe this won't reach anyone that can help me, but even the slightest suggestions would matter so much to me.

 Just because you *can* do that doesn't mean you *should*...

 That was my first thought, too! What an ugly building... 




 I see what you did there... 




 This made my day. Thank you for sharing it :)

 Watch the documentary "Beauty is Embarrassing" and you'll get your answer.  
They basically had their own behind the scenes puppet show going at all times. 




 Greek Salads....  Or pickles.  
I know they're considered healthy per se, but only eating the same thing is really unhealthy. I actually *did eat them every day* during a really hot summer that nothing else appetized me because hot food repulsed me and I lost an unhealthy amount of weight. 




 Gotcha. Just misinterpreted the question as emotionally destabilize rather than literally. My bad! 




 Some places slice the steak for you; it depends on the place. Usually they'll cut it for presentation but they'll let it sit to settle the juices a bit prior to slicing... I work at a (relatively nice) restaurant and we serve our NY strip sliced usually.  
 
I eat my steak as rare as the chef will allow it and only like mine seasoned with garlic, salt and pepper and MAYBE garnished with butter 




 I guess I didn't read "destabilize" as "cause war" and more so just felt that this pope is pretty rad and has made a lot of statements encouraging compassion to a lot of groups that had received a lot of hate (gays, evolutionary biology, etc) that if he was **assassinated** it would cause a lot of outrage.... Does that make sense? 




 The Pope... 




 "This isn't my first [time at the] rodeo" 




 Oh wow this is a great one :) 




 Awwww yiss! 




 Subtle; nice :) 




 Oh wow this is my favorite! 




 Do you have an isolated cutout of the protester? 




 Perfect. Hahaha :) 









 Redemption is a great rye! I was drinking Rittenhouse myself yesterday :)
Sorry you got mauled by your slicer! I almost ended up like you yesterday while using my friend's slicer that appears to be on steroids 




 HAHAHAHA I used to work with you at Apple in 2006/7! 




 Ha! This is perfect, thank you so much! :) 




 Yeah, that's the big reason why I'm okay with it, too but it'd be cool to have at least some feathered dinos like Archeopteryx or something :) 




 Dude, seriously. I know they're trying to be consistent but damn I'd love to see some feathered raptors. 




 Hahahahaha thanks so much, this is too perfect! I love sketching in blue, too. You managed to get our derp faces very well :) 




 Aww, thank you so much! You really captured his "I'm better than you, human" face :D

 Not very good at people or buildings/machines but I love drawing animals and creatures. I'm just looking for inspiration for silly doodles. 




 [Here's a quick doodle of the kitty...](http://i.imgur.com/ZOFOKLe.jpg) 




 This was a reunion episode for funny or die or something of that sort... It was mocking itself.


Edit: [it was Jimmy Fallon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW0SacO27Uk) 




 He just got fed but he's on a diet so that wouldn't surprise me.  









 RIP the liner of that pool 




 I stay home and order chinese food and try to watch as many movies as I can so I don't have to think about my family.  
Edit: I don't really have much of a family (even though they're alive). Alcohol helps if you're forced to be around them.  




 This is great. I completely agree. 




 It's okay, spunky monkey has a stick up his/her ass. While it's possible for the dog to have been flicked with water; it's doubtful the dog would stay in place while that happens to him (even if OP is holding a treat, a dog would think the flicking motion was OP throwing it and likely stand up). Also, we can't see the other side of the vest so we don't know if it's not drool or rainwater (it was sprinkling where I live today) or anything. Some people just really love to claim animal abuse with little to no evidence...  
I'm not absolving OP because my claims are as good as any other schmuck, but let's give OP benefit of the doubt.   SpunkyMonkey has already commented on this thread the same accusation quite a few times.

 Danny Elfman (the guy who does all the music for Tim Burton). This is his band Oingo Boingo. All of their stuff is so delightfully strange.  




 The Thesaurus. You may think I'm kidding, but I'm not. 
























 Thanks! :) 




 Thanks! Keep practicing! It's frustrating at first but it really allows you to be way more forgiving of your art's natural flaws... Actually, just about all of my favorite work in the past few years was done with a right handed sketch and cleaned up with my left :) 




 Very cute! I'm sad there's no walrus and the carpenter, though :) 




 Great colors and angle!

I can't sleep so I've been doodling and waiting to post these, haha. This is my first sketchdaily!  
I haven't really been drawing much lately, so it feels great to take it up again! Rodent like creatures are fun :3 




 Great pic! Your tumblr is stunning 




 These are amazing 




 This is amazing! Arya's my homework and Song of the Sea is such a beautiful movie, too.  




 RIP Beau Biden!  
Well, I agree with you there. Honesty is important and I agree you 100% deserved the truth... Sadly, people do stupid things when they feel guilty about their stupid choices. I'm glad things are better post divorce, though! I think the best you can do is focus on your own happiness now :) 




 I would wait a couple more days and rather than text/call her saying you want to go on another date, text/call her and give more concrete plans and let her take the reins... For example "Hey, X, how does a road trip to the beach and having a picnic by the water sound? Friday at 8 work for you?"  or something to that tune depending on where you live and what y'all find to be fun and appropriate. 




 You wrote this like a beat poet. 

I'm sorry for the salt in the wound, but all in all it sounds like it was all for the best. Not everyone is the same; not everyone is capable of monogamy and it seems like you and your ex were fundamentally different. Was it wrong for her to not tell you her true intent? Yes. Can you blame her, though? That's a tough pill to swallow and it sounds like you and she will live a happier life doing your own thing. I honestly just hope for the best for your daughter and that she doesn't get introduced to a rotating door of weird partners via your wife and her new man.  

Also, get checked for STD's like everyone else has said. 




 Wow holy shit are you living my exact life? I have fought tooth and nail with my bf about his psycho ex contacting him with inappropriate stuff and he can't understand why I want her gone. He also doesn't understand how him talking to her is just encouraging her negative behavior. Hugs, OP. I hope things go well! 




 Oh also I now have the imagine of the police blacking up a body after shooting it.

 The Wind in the Willows 




 Ahahaha, I am a part of the room mate dynamic and when they *asked me what I preferred*, I answered them honestly. That also included me stating that I was willing to move out myself. 




 Also, the girl JUST got out of a relationship where they were saying they loved each other. It's just... It feels odd. 




 Grackles are some tough motherfuckers. I've seen some really fucked up looking grackles just going about their day unfazed. 




 Reason A is directly linked to reason B...So, yes. If I didn't live with both of them, I'd be fine with visits and hearing the resulting porkfest. I just don't want to live with a couple; even if they're my friends. 




 True. Very good point. I thought I was okay with it but hearing them occupy the one bathroom for 45 minutes to fuck is kind of annoying... And then loudly fucking twice more, once while I'm trying to work from home is a little more than I bargained for, so I kind of just made the change of heart today. 




 Additionally, I don't find him relatable because we have very little shared interests and holding a conversation just feels forced. He is a great man and I love him as a room mate, but I could live without him without losing any sleep over it, that's all. 




 I've heard my room mates have plenty of sex. Just not with each other. I just don't like living with couples. Is there something wrong with having that preference even if the couple happens to be my friends? 




 Never issues. I've just never really felt compelled to converse with him. I don't find him relatable.  




 I live in a city with lots of options, so I'm sure it would be doable in short notice. I can always stay at my current apartment if they choose to move out. 




 Yeah. I'm going to take a day or so to think about a tactful and understandable way to approach it. I feel like I'm going to lose my friendship over this. I guess if that's the case, it was never really meant to be, though, eh?  




 That's the thing. I have lived with boyfriends before and have even had the "ideal" living situation where we kept separate rooms "just in case" and it has still gone up in flames. Though, I'm a very solitary person and enjoy my alone time and independence, so I may differ from them there. It's just hard to see myself in their shoes because I've been there (but always lived alone with a partner) and it was not fun. 




 Already on it. I'm honestly looking at places with them and on my own simultaneously, just in case. I'm leaning more and more towards an independent move at this point, though. 




 We've discussed it. It's a really weird conversation to have because they don't even know what to label their relationship yet. It's overall just kind of messy in my eyes and I've expressed my anxiety. I then felt incredibly guilty because a few of my coworkers at the bar (I work at a bar in addition to a full time desk job) seemed to think I was being unreasonable for feeling nervous/hesitant and told them I would live with them and get over it.... I am not over it. 




 It's hard to put my finger on it. I think mostly it feels like I'm hearing my brother and sister fucking each other if that makes sense. Beyond that, I just have never really liked the idea of living with a couple. Especially new couples. No matter how well we get along and how well we know each other,  it's still a new relationship and things could change for the worse.  
 nbsp;  
Also, to be completely honest, I've never felt as comfortable hanging out with the guy alone without her there to facilitate the conversation so, meh.   




 The three of us all met when we moved into this apartment and have fortunately gotten along really well. The two of them have always seemed close but aside from my friends joking to me that they seem to have chemistry, nothing has really happened.  

 nbsp;  

Somewhere over the last few weeks, they've started hooking up. Honestly, I'm not surprised at all by this and I think they would make a great couple, but what bothers me is the fact that we had intended to look for new apartments together as our lease ends in August. When they found out I knew, we had a chat and discussed options and both of them seemed surprised that I was hesitant to move into a new place with them.  

 nbsp;  

Ive never found myself in a situation like this and I dont know if all three of us living together is the best idea. I could honestly live with it, but its not my preferred option. I mentioned to them that I would rather one of them live elsewhere but now, honestly, I think that the girl would just end up resenting me for breaking up "the group" or think I'm a tightass or something.  

 nbsp;  

After a long talk with them and consulting some friends, I decided that maybe I was just being sensitive and that I should just suck it up and give it a shot. We all get along so well and we all know we like living together so it's possible it could work... But this is all uncharted waters for me and I'm having second thoughts. We looked at a new apartment today and we would have signed for it if the landlord hadn't found a more long term candidate and I'm honestly relieved. I can't help it, but hearing them fucking makes me incredibly uncomfortable and almost like a "prisoner" in my own home and a thirdwheel amongst my room mates. I feel incredible guilt that I'm reacting this way. I feel unreasonable and childish that I can't just nut up about it but I keep going back and forth between acceptance, anger, sadness and anxiety about my living situation.  

 nbsp;  

**tl;dr**: I love my room mates of two years, but ever since they started hooking up (past few weeks) I no longer feel comfortable living in my apartment with them. Am I being unreasonable?

 nbsp;

**UPDATE:** Thanks for all your help and advice, all! It means a lot to hear so many different opinions. I sent a text to my room mates that said:
"Hey guys, I've been thinking about this and I think I need to give up the search. It's been great living with you both and I love you both but I just dont think I am ready to take on a new apartment. I probably am going to stay at the current place until I get my finances more in order. I think you two should continue to look for a place together, though."  
 nbsp;

Hopefully they'll be understanding and the next few months won't be super awkward... 




 Good luck! I'm not good at math but I think one person has good odds :) 




 Much respect to you for trying to take a literal route without being too overwhelming!  




 How did you answer his questions? 




 True, but I feel like so often if parents or support systems don't broach the subject appropriately when a child inquires, it can cause some  issues, complexes  or phobias. 




 He's a big guy I guess? Not huge or fat or anything. He works as the door guy at saloon. 




 Thanks! 




 Haha, hey Tom. The person stole the mask from Nick. I'm sure you'll hear about it tonight :) 




 Really? Around what time? 




 Thank you. I know it isn't much, but this mask means a lot to my friend. He was really upset about it. 




 I've played tug of war over a kiddie pool filled with baked beans... This kind of reminds me of that. It was pretty gross, but it was entertaining! 




 My friend is an artist who also works at saloon as the bouncer. He puts a lot of time, care and effort into making his costumes for Halloween as he works during that season as an extra. He was closing up saloon and foundry tonight around 12:45-12:55pm when someone stole his mask from the host stand at saloon. We are trying to locate the theif or at the very least, his mask he has worked hard on. If anyone sees any goons bragging about their find or sees anything on social media, please let me know. Thank you!!! 









 wow, wow, wow. 




 Jaguars... They already are. They like to eat hallucinogenic plants and trip balls. 




 Haha yes! I love how he asked for BREAD but you read BEARD. I thought I was crazy at first 




 Oh! I used this exact photo [as a reference for a painting of mine](http://faunus-crypticus.tumblr.com/post/102707799430/work-in-progress) 




 Poor barn owl. Too bad collecting it's bones is illegal. 




 My cat's name is Hercules, too! Goooooo Hercules!!! 




 I look forward to seeing you again! Keep kicking ass! 




 OMG I totally talked to you at saloon like, two Sunday's ago! I was your waitress. GO YOU! I remember that you are such a beam of sunshine and now I understand why!!! Keep that kickass spirit. People pay attention to a positive attitude :)
