 It wouldn't let me because I just created my account and apparently I have low comment karma. 




 He did quit at one point, when Skylar showed him that huge stack of money. 




 You make some good points, but again, if he hadn't done that stuff then he would be dead himself, so he was just making that choice so I think the ends justify the means. I'm no saying he's right, but there has to be some "relatability" to him because he was always put in the situation where he had to make that choice. As for shooting Mike, yes he was wrong in doing that because "he didn't have to". But Mike was willing to kill Walter just a few seasons ago on Gus' orders. I say if someone smites you on one cheek, smash them on the other. I'm not saying the guy was a saint, and after reading all your comments I would venture to change the title of the post to something a little less polarizing, but he didn't deserve everything that happened to him-- and Vince Gilligan always said that Breaking Bad takes place in a moral universe, one where everyone gets what they deserve. My heart broke when everyone he loved turned on him and his family betrayed him and he didn't deserve that because he was a victim. 




 LOL I think I will actually I'm excited for someone to prove me wrong. Not that I know I'm right, that's not what I meant. I just would like someone to convince me of their opinion. 




 Good point. Thanks for your reply all my friends are just jokingly calling me a sociopath. But, although I forgot the context of Mike's death, I have to say Mike, although likable, wasn't entirely innocent. He was prepared to kill Walter before so it's not like he didn't adhere to the self-preservation idea. He was always a liability and he could have ruined everything Walter worked for. 




 Yes most definitely I would. I would hang out with everyone who I know will be famous but keep a low profile for the most part. The Greek philosophers, Jesus, Shakespeare, etc. Then when the 20th century starts I can have my real fun and meet every cool musician. If I get bored then I'll just fake my own death. 




 I can't rank these but I would love to see them on the list. 
The Stooges (by the Stooges) was released in 1969. I love how Ron Ashton did so much with like three chords. The bass held its own while Ashton would masturbate for like five minutes and Iggy would sing the most ballad-y song ever. Everyone talks about Raw Power but they forget this album.
MBV (by My Bloody Valentine) was released in 2013 and sounds so peculiar and nice.
Innerspeaker (2010) by Tame Impala is so ethereal sounding and haunting you have to include it. 




 I recently watched Breaking Bad and enjoyed it a lot. But the whole time I was thinking about how Walter did nothing wrong. Yes, he killed Jane and orchestrated Gail's murder, but I don't think he was wrong in doing that. Jane put him in a position where it was either her or him and his family. I don't lie to myself and pretend to be righteous, when given the choice, if someone put me in a position where it's them or me I will choose myself. As for Gail, Wlater didn't actually pull the trigger, it was Jesse (not that he was wrong either). Gail was a liability and you can't blame either Walt or Jesse for choosing themselves over someone else. You can't forge a connection with someone and pretend that you would sacrifice yourself over them.
I don't know, I've spoken to my friends and no one agrees with me but ultimately the gist of my argument is that we shouldn't lie to ourselves. If we're given the choice to either die or have someone else die, we will choose the other person. It's self-preservation and it's a natural instinct that we shouldn't hide from or be ashamed of.

Edit: when I said recently that was a bit of a stretch. It has been like a year since I watched it so I forgot about the whole killing Mike and poisoning Brock stuff, but I stand by my statement (albeit not as strongly as before). 
























 Rude! 




 What if LoL had characters from anime like Naruto, Sasuke, Kakashi, etc. Kakashi's ult would be his sharingan and he could send the opponent champion anywhere on the map. Or from Fairy Tail Natsu's fire dragon roar would be his Q. Would take a million years in programming but worth it. 




 Yes, he wasn't a total monster but also I don't think he did anything deserving of what he got in the end. Even the really bad  things he did were justified and I think if many of us were in his place at the time, we would have done the same thing (assuming we're as clever as Walter White). 




 Really? How? You're right I do think they're the same thing. 




 Yeah, true. But it's still agreed upon that he killed her, don't you think so? 




 Anything can ruin lives, not just drugs. It's up to the consumer to say no, it's not up to the man trying to make a living. For all you know, meth could have enhanced the lives of a minority who would otherwise have nothing else. 




 One second. You don't think "justified" and "not wrong" are the same thing? Because I do. 




 I can't believe you writed that. 
























 Noooooooooooooooooo 




 This has been an ongoing fight between my friend and me. She says that in the summer, the sea is colder than the air around the adjacent land, and in the winter, it's warmer. I don't think she's right. If she is, at what temperature does the switch happen? 




 Him: If you could have dinner with anyone who would it be?
Me: Mark Twain
Him: It has to be someone real 




 What about an arabic sounding accent? That wouldn't be sexy right? Because on the one hand you have the Islamic empire pre-1700 being super powerful culturally but then you have the whole colonized for centuries thing. 




 Sakata Gintoki from the manga/anime Gintama 




 What did you do? Besides post on Reddit. 




 Good point but it would only be for a couple of weeks, so it wouldn't really interfere with LoL lore. Besides no one really plays it for the lore no one even knows their champions backstory. 




 It's either Hudson Mohawke's sample of Still On It or Spit Thunder by Krampfthaft. I looked it up on whosampled.com 





























 Cersei Lannister. Woman was forced to marry someone, he treated her like a garbage can despite her hair, had a sociopath son, a dad who only cared about his legacy, had her daughter shipped off to Dorne, and a drinking problem. And the only guy who really loves her is her brother. Gross. Then when she tries to protect her kids or get revenge for some things, she's branded as evil. Don't get me wrong the things she has done this season have been uncalled for though. But before she was shit on for no reason. 




 How's your butt doing? 




 Many thanks. Will not be showing her this. 




 OOOOOOHHHHH 




 BASE jumping! 




 But it's warmer. Doesn't that mean it absorbs more energy? Bear with me I'm really bad at science stuff. 




 Okay but if it doesn't change temperature as much as air then why does it absorb more energy sometimes (winter) and less energy other times (summer)? 
























 No. The only two episodes that I know of that Gail the Snail is in are The Gang Gives Frank an Intervention and the last episodes of season 9, which is I think The Gang Squashes Their Beefs. She first appeared in season 5. Mac Bangs Dennis' mom is in season 2 I think. 




 No that's The Gang Gives Frank an Intervention. Mac Bangs Dennis' mom is the one where Mac bangs Dennis' mom and then Dennis tries to sleep with all the moms to retaliate. 




 I have some personal favorites but I'm a die-hard fan and I tend to like even the ones that no one enjoys but these episodes are what I always hear from my friends.
1. The Gang Dances Their Asses Off
2. Dennis and Dee Go On Welfare
3. Mac Bangs Dennis' Mom 




 He does this thing where like, he doesn't exist. It's hilarious you have to be there to get it. 




 Beavis and Butthead. Imagine Butthead commenting on the video for Wrecking Ball 




 LOST. 




 It's the coolest thing, ever. 




 No because I overeat for the most part. And this is assuming I live in a country where a large number of people are hungry so it's not like transporting the food is an issue. 





























 Milk. Why would you get weaned off the milk of your mother only to go onto the milk of something that's not even human? Most people won't even taste breastmilk when they're adults but have no problem with breastmilk from cows when they're adults. 




 The dais should be as follows:
1. Sarah Silverman
2. Amy Schumer
3. Anthony Jeselnik
4. Jeff Ross
5. Natasha Lagero
6. Nick Kroll
7. Pete Davidson
8. Snoop Dogg 




 I beg to differ. Toplexil tastes great. Like the end of a caramel custard cup. 




 That's honestly what you get for storing someone somewhere you're going to fart a lot. Also think about how many of her particles get in their noses every day. I'm all for cremation but the storage is horrible, you can't just leave her there and expect everything to be great. 




 Hey! What's my fastest ticket to Canada? I'm 21 and I just finished my B.S in Biology in Lebanon. I'm willing to do a Masters degree in anything as long as it gets me out of my country to work somewhere else. I would have to do the Masters in Lebanon but I don't mind. 




 Finest moment ever.

 Some law of masses or something. You can't create more mass than you put in. 
























 Brian Jonestown Massacre's Sound of Confusion is amazing. It's more of a compilation of like six songs with some background noise in the beginning but it's great. The Wiper's Youth of America is amazing and is very punk rock with a very nice riff. 




 If you like indie check out The Virgins, they have some very catchy tunes. If you like 80's or 90's real alternative Teenage Fanclub is great (I Don't Know and Don't Look Back are my favorites). But if you want something more current check out Pity Sex they have an album called Feast of Love and a song on it called Drown Me Out. Also Title Fight have a song called Your Pain Is Mine should satisfy your cravings. Please let me know how it works out! 




 I think the Stooges put out their best record first. Everyone always talks about Fun House and Raw Power but they overlook The Stooges. It had the best out of place ballad-y songs using like five chords and Ron Ashton going crazy on his solos. 




 I disagree, anything on Strange Days is better the best song from The Doors. 









 You have to be really punk to pull it off and/or a The Germs tribute band. 




 She cracked her voice because of the strain and then miscarried after singing that song but she got whoo from Mick so it's all good. 




 One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and Fight Club 
























 No idea sorry, can you try Shazam-ing it? 




 Listen to Title Fight's album Hyperview. It's alternative rock but it's almost minimalist. I would suggest it if you enjoy listening to music as an aural experience since they play around a lot with the acoustics of the thing and make it sound very ambient for an alternative record, which is interesting to say the least. It's as if the sound kind of surrounds you from all sides as opposed to just going in your ears laterally, if that makes sense. It's also a very cohesive album so if you hear it in one sitting you'll enjoy it even more. Or if you can wait until July then listen to Tame Impala's new album it's called Currents. Or if you can't wait listen to some of the songs on it that are already out. They're a wonderful mix of, well, you can't really pin Tame Impala into a genre they're just great. They're basically every 60's and 70's band you ever loved reimagined and reconstructed. 




 Alice Cooper - Is It My Body, The Rolling Stones - Shake Your Hips
 




 My Bloody Valentine has not necessarily gotten better with age, but when you have a phenomenal record like Loveless coming out in 1991 and then 22 years later being able to put out M B V in 2013 with similar results really says something. It's really hard to top Loveless but M B V definitely makes me want to pull my hair out trying to choose between the two so that says something. 




 Absolutely. Ringo Deathstarr is doing shoegaze quite brilliantly. 




 There's a French band called La Femme with a debut album called Psycho Tropical Berlin. Beware though they're pretty niche but great. 




 I' don't know what kind of music you like or tend to listen to normally but think 80's post-punk/new wave. Bands like Blondie, Devo, Dexy's Midnight Runners, Dire Straits, that stuff. 




 Honestly you can't hate on Ariana Grade for her song Love Me Harder. It is a great pop song, especially the production. But while you're on The Zombies, Time of the Season is amazing. The Beatles' I'm Only Sleeping is great. Honestly my definition of pop is pretty fluid it kind of merges into indie if you're going into the 21st century, in which case I would recommend The Virgins' debut album.
