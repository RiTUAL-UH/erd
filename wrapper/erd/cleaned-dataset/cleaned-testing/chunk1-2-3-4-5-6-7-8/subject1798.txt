 Forget the ads unless you want to compete against a hundred other applicants. No matter how good you are, if you're coming off the street you're going to get lost in the pile.

Instead, identify 5 companies you want to work for. Think about what you are actually **qualified** to do, even if the only thing may be to push a broom and scrub a toilet. Try to find out an important person in that department and arrange a 15 minute meeting with them. Almost everyone will give 15 minutes to somebody who shows initiative.

Now, you have to know what they're looking for, and know something about the culture of the company. Do your research. Explain to them why their company is a fit for you and vice versa. 

If you get the job, remember 3 things:

1. Show up 5 minutes early.
2. Do something every day that isn't asked of you.
3. Stay 5 minutes late.

 I would. You'll have plenty of chances to drink KJ at parties and weddings. When you are searching for yourself, try something different. Those vineyards are trying to make a name for themselves so you might discover a real gem. I have a friend who is an excellent sommelier. He started a winemaking operation a few years ago and just released his second vintage, a 2013 sauvignon blanc, for $16.99. He put a TON of time into getting it just right for him. 




 It's always a gamble, whether at $15 or at $100. I think what you enjoy is very personal. My wife and I have very different tastes but neither is "wrong." What I like about $15 is that I'm not out a whole bunch if the wine makes me say "meh." 




 It depends on the vintner. Some $20 bottles might as well be $8. But for more reputable small-batch vintners, a $20 wine probably has a little higher quality of production. The sugars are monitored more closely to determine harvest, the destemming is more thorough, the blending is a little more deliberate to create more complexity and balance that the winemaker is seeking, and it's probably aged a little more and perhaps finish-fermented in oak or cement. 









 Thank you, Ohio State, for showing why we needed a playoff. 




 Urban Meyer has always been a gambler. We'll see if it bites him in the butt this time.

 At the end of the day, it's still about viewership for ESPN and the SEC can deliver that better than any other conference. 




 **This** is why we've needed a CFB playoff. Because OSU obviously deserves a chance to make it to the championship game. 




 Damn, Alabama is the best tackling team I've ever seen in CFB. 




 start delayed to 9 pm EST. 




 Ohio State is the only team that will give Oregon a game. Alabama would get steamrolled. 




 You will get your wish. And you will regret it. There is no school in the SEC that is prepared for the Oregon offense. It's one thing to watch film and come up with a game plan. It's a completely different thing to be on the field. 




 FSU defenders not used to defending an option. You gotta make a decision. You can't be undecided. 




 Now let's just hope for no injuries. Ducks deserve to play the championship game at full strength. Well played, Oregon. 




 Exactly. Keep your team in the game mentally. If you don't convert a 4th down, the game is over. That was not the time to make that decision. That's a last-5 minute kind of decision. 




 I can not believe the coach was willing to put the entire game on the line in the 3rd quarter. How much is FSU paying him?? 




 When a coach makes a call like that, they're telling their team that they are panicking. Dumb decision. 




 FSU deserved to lose after that stupidest decision of the entire year of any coach. 




 No way. They are risking the entire game in the 3rd quarter? Dumb decision. Bad decision. Take 3. 




 That was seriously an awesome play. FSU defense has never seen an offense like this. Class is in session for FSU. 




 Oh boy, now the ball goes back to Oregon with time left for them to score. 




 FSU can definitely move the ball on Oregon. They're just not sharp inside the 20. 




 Cry me a river. Fucking white people.

 Correct rule, wrong interpretation. You should round down to 20.  




 The rule is half plus seven.  




 A progressive tax does not necessarily eliminate the incentive to having higher income unless it's up near 100%. There is, of course, a curve--The Laffer Curve. All economic models show that a progressive tax will produce the most tax revenue while still enjoying economic productivity.

In the 50s and 60s, the United States enjoyed a tremendous boost in productivity and wealth yet the top tax rates (for the top 0.1%) are almost double what they are today. 




 No tax targets only the area in which a corporation or individual is based. It all goes into a pile and is apportioned. To look at taxes as being earmarked would lead to a gross misunderstanding of the federal revenue and apportionment system of the United States.

Second, corporations do not benefit themselves. They are set up to benefit individuals, from wage earners to shareholders. By shifting the corporate tax burden to individuals, you can more accurately tax the benefit that the individual receives.

Third, eliminating the corporate tax also eliminates the incentive for keeping profits overseas and brings more money back into the U.S. where it helps Americans, rather than helping foreign economies. 




 If you ask economists, some of the proposals that almost all of them agree on would include:

* Eliminate corporate taxes - companies can reinvest more money into their businesses and create more jobs.
* Eliminate mortgage interest deduction - this deduction distorts the housing market and tends to give more benefit to wealthier people.

There are others but these are the two biggest ones off the top of my head. 




 As others have already stated, Duverger's Law is at work here. The "winner takes all" system practically guarantees that up to half of a district's citizens will be disenfranchised. I see it as a major reason for today's voter apathy.

 Glucose is a monosaccharide, meaning that its a single sugar molecule. It's pretty much the only thing cells burn for fuel. You are right that when you eat glucose, it goes directly into the blood to be used by your cells. Fructose heads to the liver where it's metabolized into lipids (fat). Here's where you went off track:  sucrose is a disaccharide, meaning it has two sugar molecules bonded together. Sucrose is 50/50 glucose and fructose. HFCS is 55% fructose, 41% glucose so the two really aren't that different. It's best to get your glucose from grains and avoid sugar altogether.  




 "You can be whatever you want to be."  Bullshit.  




 I had an awesome BK experience a couple of days ago. I put in my order for 2 whopper combos and I watched as my cashier overfill the French fry holders (what are they actually called, anyways?). He actually pounded the scooper and holder on the counter to get as many fries into the holder as he could. Then, after putting the fries and burgers in the bag, he took the scooper and dumped a bunch more fries into the bag. That has never happened before and may never happen to me again.

 There are a lot of social and financial factors at play. Essentially this is the result of cheap, easy debt and the 30 year mortgage. The price of something is set by how much somebody is willing to pay. If somebody is willing to spend 30 years paying for something and are able to get a loan with a monthly payment of upwards of 35% of their gross earnings, it will likely drive up the price of that item. And because the fed keeps the lending rate so low, banks can charge lower interest rates on mortgages. Does that mean people will lower their mortgage payments or be willing to pay a higher principal for homes? The latter. Again, this drives up the price of homes. 

But that money comes from some other part of the economy. Food, clothes, vacations, retail goods. All of these suffer.

 The ratio of the national debt to the U.S. GDP isn't high compared to historic levels. 

The idea is that a free or low cost education would be incentive for more people to get post-high school degrees, thereby attracting companies with a smarter, more capable workforce. This in turn would increase salaries and result in higher tax revenues. 




 Yes, and thanks for a better explanation than mine. 




 My response assumes you're referring to the U.S. economy.

The U.S. borrows at an incredibly low interest rate, in the tenths of percent. That's because the creditworthiness of the U.S. is high. People like buying U.S. debt because it's a safe place to park their money.

The U.S. gets enormous benefit from this. Let's say you make a really cool widget out of your garage. By yourself you make one a day. A rich uncle is willing to loan you $500,000 at 0.15% interest. You can use that money to buy more equipment, hire and train workers. Now you are earning 10X or 100X what you were earning before, AND employing people. That's a multiplier effect on your GDP. You'd be stupid not to take the money.

The U.S. uses debt to build roads, networks, satellites and pays for research that benefits everyone, and a military to protect all of it. In other words, that debt helps the producers produce more in a safe and fairly well regulated market.

 This example is about lying after receiving immunity. Maybe not exactly what you're looking for? You may not get charged with making a false statement if you have more serious charges in front of you, but it wouldn't look good for you if the case made it to court.

11th Circuit Court of Appeals: 
*Giving a false statement is an independent criminal act that occurs when the individual makes the false statement; it is separate from the events to which the statement relates, the matter being investigated...We agree with the circuits that have addressed this issue before us and have determined that Garrity-insulated statements regarding past events under investigation must be truthful to avoid future prosecution for such crimes as perjury and obstruction of justice. Garrity protection is not a license to lie or to commit perjury.*

 Dude, it sounds like she is way needy for affirmation. That's why she needs you to affirm that you still put her on a pedestal and I suspect that's also why she had the affair. 

It's a double-edge sword. It may be part of why you were attracted to her to begin with (that she needs constant affection from you) but it appears that, like any drug, its effect wears off and she will go looking for more affection from other places. Until she gets some psychological help to understand why she went looking for the thrill in the first place, I'd be pretty careful.

But then, if she somehow fixes what is wrong with her, she may not be the same person you fell in love with. 




 You are right with your example. If the act of drinking itself is a crime then you don't have to admit to it. It's the same as pleading not guilty to a judge even though you did commit the crime; you are presumed innocent until proven guilty.

 Compass headings aren't accurate enough for cross country flight, especially when you have crosswinds (meaning the aircraft's nose is pointed in a different direction than it's actually flying. General aviation (private pilots mostly) use a lot of dead reckoning (i.e. looking out the old window). Commercial aircraft flying at high altitudes tune in to radio beacons called NDBs, VORs (and even AM radio stations) and they sort of zig-zag across the country flying straight from radio tower to radio tower.

 Power (Watts) = Potential (Volts) x Flow (Current)

I'm rewriting my explanation to make it applicable to solar panels.... hold on.

Solar panels are rated in watts. A good analogy is water coming through your garden hose and you've got your thumb on the end of it. Your thumb is the resistance (ohms). When you increase your thumb's resistance, you increase the water pressure (which is comparable to volts) and decrease the volume (which is comparable to amps). Your municipal water pumping station is like the wattage. A more powerful pump (higher watts) will increase the water pressure and/or water flow.

 The three Constitutional amendments that give the Supreme Court authority are:

* The 10th: Federal powers

In other words, States can define marriage but not in any way that would violate Constitutional protections. They can, for example, set minimum-age requirements, who can or cannot perform the ceremony, divorce laws, but they can't discriminate by telling people who they can marry (Loving v. Virginia). 




 Public schools are funded from tax revenue and generally must accept everyone who lives within their district. It's a lengthy and almost impossible process to kick someone out of public school. Public schools are governed by an elected school board.

Private schools get no funding from tax revenue. There is an application process and it's easy to kick someone out. They are not required to administer any of the standardized tests that public schools do.

Charter schools are public schools with an application process. They receive a predetermined amount of money per student that they accept and it's generally fairly easy to kick someone out. They must also perform all testing required by state and federal laws. Charter schools are governed by their own boards established by their own bylaws. 




 Frying in oil produces a crispy texture because it has a high boiling point. Unlike potato chips, fries and tater tots aren't cooked to the point of driving all moisture out. They retain some moisture. As soon as you take them out of the fryer the moisture starts to affect the texture of the food. The longer you wait the worse it gets. The refrigerator just makes more moisture collect on the surface since less of it evaporates in the cold air. 




 In Utah they used a variation of the "Please, think of the children" theme. The Utah AG's office argued to the court that the State has an interest in promoting child birth and stable families, and that same-sex marriages hurts the institution and somehow dissuades opposite-sex couples from marrying.

Never mind that:

* There are opposite-sex couples who can't conceive, yet are still granted marriage licenses.

* Divorce rates and the number of single-parent households are higher than ever under current marriage laws.

 Incomplete compared to what we know today, but not wrong. Evolution (speciation) was well known prior to Charles Darwin. What Darwin did was explain how it worked. Prior to Origin of the Species, people thought, for example, that giraffes stretched their necks through the process of reaching for the leaves on the upper branches of trees and passed this on to their offspring. Darwin came up with the theory of natural selection, that mutations (they were thought of as natural variations at that time) which gave an individual a small advantage would be passed on while variations that decreased survival would obviously decrease the chances that individual would produce offspring. 




 Money is probably the greatest economic invention of all time. It lets people get things that they need without actually having to trade for it, and to let people become specialists which accelerated technological advancement.

Before money, there were no people who only were masons because they would go hungry since they would have to trade work directly to a farmer for food. After money, the farmer paid the mason, which allowed him to focus on farming without having to know how to build his house. The mason took the money and paid toolmakers who then paid other farmers for their food.

Humans being what they are, a moneyless society would break down pretty fast because there would always be slackers who just rely on asking others for help without giving much effort in return. 




 Bold red wines have high levels of tannins at bottling time. The tannins, which help preserve the wine, come from the grape skins as well as the oak barrels during secondary fermentation. The grape skins and the oak add complexity but the tannins are so astringent that you will have a more difficult time tasting the subtleties. The tannins break down over time (depolymerize) to reveal the wine's nature.

You can help a young high-tannin wine be more drinkable by decanting it to introduce a lot of oxygen which depolymerizes the tannins. If you want to do this instantly, use a blender (seriously, works great). 




 Because the value of a car depreciates rapidly. If you finance a car, you are more likely to justify purchasing a new or newer model based on your monthly payments. If you pay cash, you are more likely to purchase a used car where the money you lose through depreciation is significantly less than any income you would have gained from the interest by investing the difference. If you even invest it at all. 




 The amount of debt compared to GNP/GDP is quite low. The two aren't independent. The U.S. debt helps us push GDP to its high levels because it funds education grants to make smarter citizens, police and regulatory agencies to help ensure competition, tax incentives to build factories that employ people, roads to transport goods, and a military to protect that economic engine and keep it humming. 




 It depends on the bread recipe too. Ever tasted old butter? Staleness is mostly caused by fats getting oxidized. Breads that have no fat (like bagels) won't taste stale but they dry out, lose their texture and harden faster.

By the way, the same applies to meats. Ever wondered why meat stews and chilis can last in a fridge but grilled steak, even wrapped tight, doesn't? The meat in a stew is covered by liquid which inhibits oxidation of the fats. 




 I think it mostly depends on the speaker design. A speaker can cap the voltage with a small circuit. It still sounds like shit for exactly the same reason but it won't cause any damage.

 On the positive side, you don't have to see the players you've cut every day.  




 CharlieKillsRats has the only correct answer so far.

Look at this way:  Imagine you're a widget craftsman making widgets in your garage. You're not in any debt and you make a decent living producing 1 widget a day. Now imagine that you're also a cool dude that has always paid his bills on time so tons of people want to give you money so you can build a factory and hire workers, and they only want a couple points interest because you're so trustworthy. You will increase your earnings 10X, maybe 100X, and you're going to employ a whole bunch of people. You'd be stupid not to take the money.

That's the U.S. economy to the outside world. Except they are willing to accept as little as 0.22% interest (that's actually the 1 year t-bill rate right now).

The difference between countries like the U.S. and Germany as opposed to many other "first world" countries is that the U.S. actually does a great job converting debt into production. This encourages more people to invest, which accelerates the productivity, keeps standard of living high and interest rates low. 




 The two things that the amplifier supplies the speaker is voltage level and frequency. When you play too loud, it's not the frequency that is too high for the speaker but the voltage level.

Frequency determines how quickly the speaker cone moves back and forth creating low pitch (slow oscillation) or high pitch (fast oscillation). The voltage level determines how *FAR* the speaker moves during the oscillation, which determines how loud or soft the sound is.

If the amplifier overdrives the speaker, distortion happens because the speaker cone can't go any further, i.e. it maxes out. Instead of the air molecules moving in a smooth wave, there are sharp corners. These sharp corners don't sound good. 




 I was a non-teaching male coach of the girls soccer program at a Catholic high school, and I'm not even Catholic. So I was as outside as can be. I was an assistant when the previous head coach retired and that's how I got the job. Winning a couple of state championships and having a nationally ranked team didn't hurt either.

1. Get a teacher on staff to be a liaison. This is invaluable. They help arrange buses, get grades to you, take care of last minute changes, help get the word out, and their room is a place to hold meetings and for kids to put stuff or hang out while waiting for games to start.

2. Since you're not at the school full time, it's hard for parents to come to you so go out of your way to make yourself available to parents. Find some way to have weekly "office hours."

3. Plan. Plan. Plan. Set your game and practice schedule as early as possible. Arrange the buses. Have it in writing and published to the school and parents.

4. Get good team parents (team moms, if you aren't PC). Have them handle parental liaison as much as possible:  Fundraising, uniform orders, team dinners, barbecues, playoff special events.

5. Make sure you go to all the athletic staff meetings. The other teacher-coaches will appreciate you more. Go to their games and support them. Be a part of the school, not just your particular team. You score big points when parents and students see you in the crowd as a supporter.

6. Make sure you thank the teachers that help you or come to your games. They will in turn support your players in school. This is huge for the kids and since you're not a teacher there, they aren't going to get those platitudes from you during the day.

6. I'm sure I'll think of more....

 Eye contact.



And nice legs. 




 No, the photo will be out of focus for everyone because it was out of focus on the film plane due to your manual focusing without wearing glasses.

The viewfinder should have a diopter adjuster to let you compensate for this. If you wear your glasses you should also push back the rubber cup around the viewfinder so your eyeball is about the same distance away as without glasses. 




 Helmets only reduce surface injuries like fractures, lacerations and contusions. They do very little to reduce brain injuries because that occurs when the brain impacts the inside of the skull.

If you hit your head hard enough to cause a concussion, all that force will get transmitted to your brain regardless of whether you have a helmet on or not. You may not crack your skull though, so that's good enough reason to wear a helmet. 




 Emails are fine but are easier to brush aside so follow up if you don't hear from them. 




 Normally aspirated (ie non-turbo) car engines get their power from compression and so are sensitive to ambient air pressure. Aircraft engines do not. They get their thrust from ignition exhaust. To understand why airplanes work better at 40,000 feet, you have to understand how they fly.

There is a relationship between thrust, drag, altitude and ground speed. Lift causes drag and to keep an airplane in the air, you must have enough thrust to overcome that drag. A plane's cruising *airspeed* for any given burn rate is the same regardless of the altitude. What changes with altitude is *ground speed*. (Disregarding winds)

At lower altitudes, the air density is high thus creating a lot of drag which slows down the plane and results in lower ground speed. At higher altitudes and lower air density, the drag is significantly lower thus allowing the aircraft to fly at a much faster ground speed. 30,000-40,000 feet are well within the normal abilities of the engine to maintain cruise and climb.

TL;DR:  Airplanes get thrust from igniting fuel in a combustion chamber, not from compression. Less drag at 40,000 feet from lower air density means faster ground speed, less flying time and less fuel burned on the trip.

Me:  Private pilot. 




 If you're a franchisee, a gift card sale doesn't go to your bottom line. It's net-zero because the cost of goods is 100%--all of it goes to corporate. They will reimburse you when you actually sell a grande latte. So in other words, you sell gift cards as a duty to the franchise even though you don't make a dime from it unless it's stipulated contractually that you get some percentage. 




 Ignore the ads. Even advertised jobs are likely to go to somebody who knows somebody. Seriously, large companies always have openings that aren't currently advertised, or they can make one for somebody who they like.

If you're terrified, tell them so. Say "I just got in town and I found your company. I really like your culture but coming in here to talk to you is something that would normally terrify me." Nothing wrong with that.

Good luck, and let me know how it goes! 




 Humans are social creatures. Humor greases social interaction and gets you in the club/clan/whatever. Subjective humor is just adapting humor to a community whose culture may "get it" whereas others may not.

Example:  Fart humor isn't subjective. It's always funny. /r/watchpeopledie may be funny to a group who would likely get along with each other fairly well, but not very funny to others.

 You already answered your question.
 
*Floating can be defined along the lines of: An object in a fluid experiences an upward force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.*

Whether it's laser etched metal, wood or concrete, they all obey the laws of physics. 




 @lisaslover has a good point but I will go ahead and answer your generalized question with a generalized answer.

*In General* many immigrant families do not feel social stigma about wearing glasses. In fact, in some cultures it signals that you are wealthy enough to get glasses and you have an office job rather than being a laborer. Many immigrants, include those from Asia, place a high importance on school and getting good grades. They probably tend to have their children's vision checked early and regularly and will correct it even at levels where other parents may not. Asian kids tend to be less into sports and therefore may not choose contact lenses which have higher incidences of secondary eye problems such as infections. 




 Can you be more specific? There are a lot of issues. 




 It doesn't "go" anywhere. On a hard drive there is an area that is hidden to you called a file directory. It's a catalog of all of the files on your hard drive, i.e. where the data starts and where the data ends. When you delete a file the catalog entry is deleted, not the data itself. The space once occupied by that file gets cataloged as free space that can be written-over when you save a different file. 




 Because you may decide to have another child some day. If there are enough people who are unvaccinated then the virus will be circulating in the community and your newborn, who can't be vaccinated for several years, will be at mortal risk. 




 I think it would be. But that window has passed and now we have a massive stalemate. Withdrawal is now practically impossible for Israeli politicians. Israel has the strongest economy in the middle east outside the oil kingdoms and there is massive immigration that they are dealing with. If I recall, pretty much any Jew can move to Israel. Netanyahu's answer is permanent development of the West Bank.

The ironic thing is that the immigration has also brought in more and more liberal views of non-Israeli Jews who grew up in Western countries. So maybe there is hope for a solution 20 or 30 years down the road. 




 You must win by more than the spread. The 1/2 point is just to help people understand that concept but it's not required. So if it's New England +10 then they have to win by 11 for you to collect. Books will say +10.5 points so they don't get a whole lot of questions if NE wins by 10. But whether it's +10 or +10.5, it's the same thing. 




 To make sure you either win or lose. In betting, ties are bad. 




 In a lot of ways, Palestine was a pawn. The 6 day war was ostensibly fought over Palestinian territory (from which Israel was carved) but it was really a political fight between Egypt, Syria, Jordan and Iraq vs. Israel. Like Vietnam, Palestine was a proxy for a war of religion/ideology/politics.

Without going into whether Israel did have or did not have a right to exist, had Israel withdrawn from the West Bank after its victory, I think relationships in the middle east would be much different today. 




 Because Israel is under the protection of the United States. The United Nations is powerless since the U.S. holds a seat and a veto on the Security Council. All they can do is issue demands that Israel halt development and occupation of west bank territories. They have no ability to force it. 




 I'm confused. Don't you mean that it's therefore both? After all, vulnerabilities get patched so isn't it a case that the initial design (done by humans) did not adequately anticipate an attack or improperly coded a function, thus creating a security hole? 




 They are therefore they can? Or they can therefore they are? 




 And you can't counterfeit gold or silver, so it's a stable for monetary use. There's also enough of it to mint coins for commerce (unlike other precious metals like paladium). 




 Cool. I think that makes sense. It's gotta be the forces right at the mouth. But that means the only surface that the force can act upon to MOVE the noodle into the mouth would be surface imperfections that transmit the force from high pressure to low, left to right (in relation in your drawing).

ASCII art:

    F --/\   F --/\  F --/\
    -----  --------  -------  ----
    NOODLE
    ---------  ------  -------  --
          --\/   --\/    --\/ 




 Ahhh, very plausible. 




 cnash, that is a very good analysis, except for one problem:  Axial stress. A wet noodle will distort under even very low loads. 




 That's what I'm thinking too. That it requires air movement and the air must be pushing on surface imperfections.

If you had a perfect seal between the noodle and your lips that did not allow any air to come through, the noodle would not move (even if there were no friction whatsoever). If the noodle surface were completely smooth, the noodle also would not move as the air passing over it has no surface to push on that doesn't have an opposite cancelling force.

So pressure differential doesn't fully explain the noodle movement. There must be air movement to make the noodle move. 




 It's still cylindrical, even when it's sitting between the lips and in your mouth. Ok, bye bye. 




 That's kind of my question. Sorry if I didn't explain well. What forces are not canceled? There must be a surface for the air to push on. Which part of the noodle? The itty bitty end? The cylindrical surface? 




 The noodle is cylindrical. Wouldn't the forces cancel if applied equally around the cylinder? 




 The noodle is cylindrical. All the forces would then cancel each other out. 




 When you blow on a balloon, it moves because there is more pressure on one side of the balloon than the other. Ever tried to push a wet spaghetti noodle? Yeah, it's all connected to itself but it's not stiff, therefore force does not transfer well. 




 To what part of the noodle is that pressure (force) being applied? 




 You know, I've asked this question of my friends and I gotta say, this is the best answer I've heard yet! 




 I get that your mouth is creating a vacuum but vacuum does not exert force. The force must come from the positive air pressure outside the mouth. What part of the noodle is the force pushing on? 




 The waves of a microwave oven are tuned to heat the water, which is exactly what you want when defrosting something frozen (because the water is what is frozen). Oven heat is absorbed by all of the mass of whatever you're defrosting. 




 Depends on where you're standing. Sound waves can add or cancel as they mix together.

(That's the science behind noise canceling headphones, which actually create a sound that is opposite in phase to the noise it's cancelling.) 




 If you lock up all the ones who test positive, you would save a lot of lives but at the expense of mistakenly imprisoning people who will never commit that crime. If you don't lock them up, more innocent people will die as a result. 




 There are a lot of visits to see an orthodontist and their assistants that all earn a wage, in a building that has an associated lease. And that orthodontist has paid for a bunch of equipment that they need, and malpractice insurance because you never know whether the kid who is getting braces is the child of a lawyer. 




 Nobody strives to create a healthy job market. They strive to create a product or service that people want, that they can charge money for and get rich off it. The job creation is just a side benefit. 




 If you took mass from the moon and brought it to earth then there is no net difference in the system. The moon would be lighter but Earth would have more mass and would exert more gravitational pull on the moon (I think). So from the laws of thermodynamics there won't be any change. 




 It's a civil contract. Jail and fines are to punish criminal violations. 

In a civil contract, when the contract is breached you would sue in civil court. You would show that you were damaged by the actions of the other party and request some monetary amount of compensation. 




 Although society doesn't look at it this way, sexuality is supposedly a spectrum. I could see for someone who is in the middle of the spectrum (we would call them bisexual, I suppose), you could feel that way about the opposite sexes. 




 Cold soggy pasta is exactly why I don't like cold pasta so your explanation of pizza crust vs. pasta makes sense. To me, cold pizza crust is OK and I don't mind eating cold pizza at all. But I have to heat up leftover pasta because the cold noodles just taste all wrong to me. 




 If you need glasses it means your eyeball isn't perfectly round. If you're nearsighted like the majority of people, your eyeball is too long. Eyeglasses correct this by distorting the view and under-focusing so that the focus point correctly hits the back of your eyeball.

 Modern structural plywood   wood frame homes can withstand quite a bit. Wood is great until you have to go over 4 or 5 stories, then it becomes a liability. 




 OK, tall highrise. Mass all the way up. The ground moves, the mass of the upper floors don't want to move, due to inertia. Shit bends.

In a steel frame high rise, an earthquake can damage and weaken the framework of the lower floors, thus causing the entire building to collapse.

You weld angle braces to strengthen the floors, like [these.](http://lh6.ggpht.com/_sd4aOA0Ur-I/SwNmHworrkI/AAAAAAAAIls/Gi4TDp-Q8AI/f0720025_thumb%5B3%5D.jpg?imgmax=800) But they can buckle due to axial load if they bend too far, so you put a concrete jacket around them, like [this](http://enr.construction.com/images2/2012/11/enr11052012cs_stadium_brbA.jpg) to keep them from going outside spec. 




 Females don't derive benefit from multiple partners as they can only be pregnant with one child at a time. Males can produce multiple pregnancies thus derive benefit. 




 Humans don't produce a lot of offspring, relative to other species. We don't have litters like dogs or produce thousands like a spider's egg sac. The goal is quality: Produce the best offspring and help them live.

So there's a tension between male and female. Females tend towards monogamy because they need a stable provider to help protect the few offspring. Males have tendencies to spread their seed around since they get so few opportunities to produce offspring. 




 Yes, I think Syriza will cave. They said what they needed to get elected. After all, politics is still about power. But when they face reality I can't imagine that they can be that stupid. 




 The trial was a farce from start to finish. There wasn't a jury that tried Saddam Hussein. It was a tribunal with American and British "legal advisors." His execution occurred less than two months after the verdict was rendered. Both Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch deemed the trial "unfair" and the U.N. declined to support it or its verdict because it did not meet international standards. The first chief judge of the tribunal actually resigned during the trial because he said that the U.S. and Iraqi governments were interfering and influencing the court. He was replaced. Saddam's lawyer was kidnapped and assassinated during the trial by Shias dressed as Iraqi police but the trial continued. One of Saddam's American lawyers, former U.S. Attorney General Ramsay Clark also decried the tribunal as unfair, and said that it was merely a show trial, that the U.S. was in fact running it while using Iraqis as a front.

The events for which he was tried occurred in 1982. But it wasn't until AFTER 9/11/2001 that America was interested in invading Iraq, capturing Saddam to put him on trial. 




 Pretty good summary. People are concerned about Greece and its weight on the Euro but I don't think people actually think a Greek exit is likely since it would set them back into the stone age. 




 As others have said, it shows that light behaves like a wave and a particle. This is how it works:

When you shine light through a thin slit, what you see on the wall behind it is not a distinct line but a fuzzy line. This shows that light is gravitationally bent by the edges of the slit as it passes through, therefore it must have mass.

Now you add a second slit and a second light so that the two images on the wall overlap. The slits polarize the light. If the lights do not behave like a wave then you will just see that the area that is overlapped will be brighter when you turn on the second light. But that's not what you see. Instead, you see alternating bands of dark and light. That's because two waves coming from different angles, as they mix, will cancel each other out in some spots and increase the energy in other spots. 




 Except that a photon is a particle and obeys particle physics. Its path bends, reflects and refracts and it imparts momentum and force. 




 Do explain why the IRS is unconstitutional when we have this thing called the sixteenth amendment to the U.S. Constitution, and whether you believe that the U.S. Supreme Court has the power to make decisions on this matter? 




 They want to get elected and they live in a right wing community.

Edit:  Sorry, that's not a helpful answer but I honestly don't know of any logical basis for their claim other than populism. The 16th amendment to the Constitution gives the federal government the ability to tax.

 Even though you don't feel it though your feet, your house is likely passing on the vibrations caused by the moving air that is generating sound waves as it moves around your house. 




 As girls enter and go through puberty, they begin thinking sexually. It's parentally and socially acceptable for a girl to express sexual desire through a boy band poster and not through putting up pictures of boy classmates all over their room.

Secondly, boy bands are idealized targets of affection. They represent success (and thus stability) so are biologically appealing to girls as they approach child-bearing ages. 




 Your example is interesting but by itself doesn't portray an accurate picture. Where do you get your food costs? In Canada, food comes from grocery stores whose prices are fairly standard. In Nicaragua, I suspect without having been there that there are public markets whose prices vary greatly with availability and your ability to barter. Secondly, there are other costs to living in either place such as taxes, housing and transportation, as well as the differences in unemployment rates (i.e. the supply of workers which affects the wages offered). The economies of Canada and Nicaragua are very different. 




 I can't speak for the accuracy of the image but when Alexander The Great and his Macedonian army traveled through and conquered the area, they left quite a bit of genetic material. There are whole villages of blonde, blue-eyed Afghanis and a high prevalence of heterochromia.

 It's interesting this guy said it was painless. I remember reading a story written by another host (is that what you would call them?) who had larvae on his back which he also decided to carry full term in the name of science. He said the emergence was the most painful thing he ever experienced in his life. 




 I think they're the hooks that the human botfly larvae has on its body to prevent anyone from trying to pull it out. I believe they retract when the larvae starts emerging. Pretty interesting little creatures. I studied up on them after a trip to the tropics that resulted in some skin boils that I thought may have been botfly larva.

 You're welcome! I recommend "Political Philosophy, a very short introduction" by David Miller. It can be read in about 1-2 hours and it gives a pretty good background for further reading if you get hooked. In one of my favorite college courses we read "History of Political Philosophy" by Leo Strauss. 




 NATO stands for North Atlantic Treaty Organization. It started of as a collection of western european countries and the U.S. who entered an agreement that if any of them were to come under military attack, the others would be obligated to come to their defense. It's a herd defense strategy and it was done to counter any possible aggression by the Soviet Union.

NATO's mission is now obviously moot. The past few military uses haven't been to defend NATO countries but ostensibly for humanitarian aid and NATO *interests* (Yugoslavia, Libya and Syria for example). Critics say that NATO should be disbanded and a new treaty be crafted that more accurately accounts for modern threats. 




 If you define reaction as seeing-brain processing-muscle reaction:

The neuro pathways of a fly are on a much smaller scale thus impulses just don't have very far to go from the eyes to the brain.

A fly's response is actually quite complicated and researchers are still trying to figure out how they make decisions when a predator is approaching. It turns out they have a really wide variety of moves and are unpredictable. 




 @ChickinSammich, thanks for the answer. Makes sense. I'm going to mark this as explained. 




 They have oil too, lots of it. The profits from the oil are put into a sovereign wealth fund that basically gives everyone an annuity. Pretty sweet but not everybody gets to have oil in their backyard. Damn, wish I was finn. Well, except for the winters.

 It's human nature. We are all guilty of being too optimistic about something. For example, influenza kills 53,000 people a year in the U.S. but few of us go get the flu vaccine. 




 I don't know if you should just assume the business owner wouldn't spend that money. Even if he just put it in the bank, it's capital that the bank can use to make a loan. 




 That's a good question. I'll start with some sociopolitical philosophy. A society develops when a bunch of people get together and agree to live by a set of rules. It can be all the citizens of the United States and the rules are the U.S. Constitution, or it can be a bunch of guys in an apartment and the rules are written on a piece of paper on the fridge. For the guys in the apartment, they may all agree on "common expenses" like toilet paper, detergent, dishes, etc. and each has to pitch in $50 a month towards the common costs. That's a tax.

A country uses a tax to provide for the common good:  Roads, military, jails, schools, though you may not get a direct benefit from all of the things they spend money on. 




 As I understand it, the ACA isn't a the government competing against a business, but a set of laws that basically say you have to buy health insurance, and it gives states some money to subsidize the low income earners? 




 All debt has a term and the U.S. is always paying off debt as it matures. It has not defaulted (yet). What John Maynard Keynes envisioned was that a country would stop borrowing when the economy was good and it no longer had to stimulate it. 




 The argument for a capital gains tax that is lower than income tax is because you could lose all of your invested capital whereas if you are working for wage income you won't ever actually lose money to your company. Secondly, you must invest for at least a year before you can realize that lower rate. It's a way to reward people for taking the risk of investing longer-term.

The counter argument to this is that the returns on investment already includes the risk. By lowering the tax rate on one versus another investment you introduce an artificial force that distorts the market.

I inform, you decide :) 
























 Nicely done. 




 Freedom allows for anything. When you have complete freedom in an unregulated market, how does that affect capitalism? 




 You are equating freedom to capitalism. So what happens when there is no government and it's complete freedom with pure unregulated capitalism? 




 The best book I was ever assigned in college. I also got to see Zinn speak at my college a few years back. He told a heartbreaking story about when he was bomber pilot at the end of WWII. 




 They are both grammatically correct but they don't mean the same thing. *Perfectly* is an adverb. It modifies verbs. *Perfect* is an adjective. It modifies nouns.

"Made it perfectly" means that you made no mistakes in the process of making. It also *implies* that "it" is well-made.

"Made it perfect" means that you made "it" into something perfect, but doesn't really describe how you made it. 




 We haven't found anything sweet in the natural world that can kill us. Part of the theory is that sensitivity to sweetness helps us identify safe foods. 




 The browser has already started downloading the file when it displays the "save as" dialog.

 In the old days, arcane programming languages (Fortran, C) didn't have compilers that were intelligent enough to infer a procedure's memory allocation requirements just from the code. When you jump into a procedure, the computer has to build a stack frame, allocating just enough memory from the stack to contain all of your variables, pointers and handles. Declaring all of your variables at the start of your procedure is telling the compiler how big your stack frame needed to be.

These days a lot of languages are *interpreted*--they aren't even compiled (Python, Javascript). For the rest, the compilers are now pretty smart about it but the language syntax of Java derives from C/C++ and it's a holdover. 




 Actually, the Christian Science Monitor's news reporting is quite unbiased and Pulitzer Prize-winning. They go out of their way to not get caught up in mass hysteria, and to maintain high standards of decorum. They are well respected in journalism. 




 I think there are a couple of explanations. First, the true believers have to die off so it takes at least a generation for non-revolutionary social change. In the meantime the young became more and more disillusioned as they saw that what they were taught in school did not match the reality on the street. They saw that the struggle remained and that the bourgeoisie was merely replaced by oligarchs. Second, in the latter half of the 20th century, after a series of tragic political wars (Afghanistan, Vietnam, the Cold War), people were pushing back against centralized governance and federalism all around the world, including both the USSR and the United States. Instead of the view that the government will take care of you, the prevailing view now is that you have to take care of yourself. That, of course, plays right into capitalism. 




 Marxist socialism requires centralized control and planning and relies on buy-in of all participants so it just isn't manageable on a large scale. When it encounters problems, it will become unstable very quickly and collapse. Capitalism, though it has its own problems, is more tolerant of mistakes, errors and human imperfections and is thus more stable. 

As we have seen, no social system exists at a perfect state, at least not for very long. It must have some kind of self-correction built in or else it will collapse. 




 The stuff inside our cells also push out at exactly the same pressure so all of our cells are at equilibrium with the air. 




 4 major things that affect the quality of a digital camera:

1. Resolution and quality of the sensor. Those are the megapixels. More megapixels is potentially more detail, but other factors come into play. Read on.
2. Post-processing. The camera makes image adjustments (contrast, brightness, white balance) then compresses it to make the file size smaller. There are big variations here because some cameras have faster processors and thus can do more. Also, the higher the compression, the smaller the file size but also the less detail the image will have.
3. Lens quality. More expensive cameras have more glass elements in the lens and higher quality glass and coatings. This helps the image come into sharper focus from the center all the way to the edge. Lower quality cameras are visibly fuzzy around the edges of the image.
4. Lens size. Larger lenses allow more light in and render lens imperfections and dirt/smudges less obvious. They also give you shallower depth of field for more creativity. 




 I can certainly understand political compromise to be able to pass anti-abortion laws. Part of my question seeks to better understand the personal beliefs of pro-lifers because it really seems like the majority are personally OK with abortion in those circumstances. Do you agree? 




 I'm with you. 




 When was the last time you or anyone you know went into Radio Shack? Why should that company stay in business in a market economy? 




 I looked at the Gallup numbers and even Googled to get them going back farther than what the opinion article showed. The Gallup statistical trends fairly well match the BLS trend, with the peak unemployment in 2009 and a steady employment growth since then. The only real difference is that Gallup includes both seekers and non-seekers in the unemployed statistic. It's certainly valuable to know both but it doesn't really matter whether you lump the two together. 

So I guess the question is what to do about people who have given up looking for work? I guess you have to ask why that happens? 

Let's say I was an NFL player but I was released by my team. I have worked out with several other teams but none of them so far have decided to offer a contract. I've decided to hang up the cleats. Can you still call me an NFL player?

So the question is what you call somebody who isn't looking for work? Sure, they're unemployed. Maybe the better thing is to call the BLS statistic "active seekers" but that doesn't quite have the same ring to it. 




 What I meant is that the pro-life side wants to enact laws banning abortions but many of those laws include exceptions to allow an abortion for rape or incest. 




 This is not meant to be a debate or be inflammatory. I just don't understand how somebody justifies the rape   incest exception. Is it merely political expedience? 




 It's far from certain that more money equates to more votes. In some examples it does appear to be a factor but there are also times when it works against a candidate.

Candidates can't afford to turn down money, and that's really where the problem lies. Money doesn't necessarily buy a candidate a win but it does buy the candidate. 




 Less reflection. Water absorbs more light. Our brain interprets the amount of light hitting our eyes as brightness/lightness. Less reflected light will make the surface appear darker. 




 Thanks, that graph is helpful indeed. 




 Thanks, that's a helpful article. If wage growth is around 2% but inflation is currently 1-1.5%, isn't it fairly inline?

Still, productivity is still increasing so that additional GDP is going somewhere. Perhaps that explains the increasing wealth gap. What to do about that? 









 For me, these four conditions:

1. When you earn enough to house, clothe and feed yourself so as to not be a burden on anyone else.
2. Your kids, if you have any, are well adjusted and generally happy
3. You enjoy being around your friends and your friends genuinely like you
4. You have enough free time and resources to do some things you really enjoy that don't make you any money 




 I've heard this claim over the past couple of years but can you supply a source to back it up?

 I don't disagree that it's mostly vanity. Still, Mercedes can't just rebadge a C class and charge 3X unless they install an aromatherapy system. 




 OK, fine. :)

The Mercedes S class has a 200 meter radar and two cameras for 3D optical sensing, biturbo V12 or V8 with a 10.0 compression ratio, computer controlled variable suspension dampening with camera-controlled adjustment, two 12.3" LCD displays in the drivers dash with road-ahead night time video display, one display is touch sensitive. Navigation, communication and system controls on the steering wheel, a Burmester 24 speaker sound system, car systems that are controllable from your smartphone, massaging seats, aromatherapy climate control, adaptive cruise control (stop   go self driving), lane departure warning, blind spot detection....

It's pretty amazing that it's reliable as it is. It's also why it's probably not a good idea to buy older used S-Classes, 7-Series or A8s. 




 Not according to the Social Security Administration.
http://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/AWI.html

The latest year they have stats is 2013 but there's no reason to think 2014 went negative.

The last time wages decreased was 2009, at the height of the recession. With unemployment dropping to 5.6%, I can't see that wages will be decreasing from 2013 to 2014.

Can you cite any study for your claim? 




 It's water vaporizing and creating bubbles that pop. 




 Land Rover (Defender 90) owner here. Can confirm. It's the equivalent of a supermodel girlfriend. Looks good but man, high maintenance. 




 In the U.S. the German auto manufacturers only import their most expensive lines which give them the most profit margin. These models have a lot more features than a basic car and are engineered for higher performance and capability, e.g. all wheel drive, independent wishbone suspension on all 4 wheels, higher compression, variable valve timing, and so on and so on. 

TL;DR: More stuff means more stuff that breaks. 




 If you didn't manage to sell before you get foreclosed, I believe the bank will take receivership of the house. They will sell at whatever price they want and they have no incentive to sell at FMV. They only want to recover their loan and foreclosure expenses. 









 It's not a debate. I'm seeking understanding on how someone on the pro-life side reconciles what appears to be a contradiction. 




 It's what pro-lifers have said.

From the National Right To Life website:
*"For more than 100 years, medical science has known conclusively that every individual's life begins at the moment of fertilization."* 




 The chance of birth defects is higher but probably still pretty rare in countries with good health care. 

The second argument is the same argument that pro-choicers use, that it's not good to force a woman to keep an unwanted child.

The third is the sticking point. It *does* seem that there are circumstances in which the mother's feelings outweigh the life in the womb. It would appear that pro-lifers and pro-choicers have a lot of similarities. 




 So it's not about the life of the baby?

 That would be the most basic of basic backups. But it's effective. 

Yes, you should be able to copy/paste to a Windows backup drive. Create a folder for your files first. Don't touch or delete any of the files  or folders that Windows has already created. 




 As Teekno said, a MLM company has product(s). Sales of the product infuses revenue into the company to be distributed among the levels. That being said, nobody buys into a MLM company to sell vitamins or fruit juice.

Pyramid schemes don't have products and revenue. They are often investment schemes around capital assets such as real estate. They promise a high return to attract investors. In order to keep attracting investors they must show that they paid those promised rates of return. The managers often take new investment money to pay the returns, in order to attract more investment. And so on and so forth until there are few new investors putting in and lots of old investors looking for payment. 




 A sonic boom is all of the sound that a jet engine makes compressed into a single wave. So I suppose if you passed the speed of light and there was actually light shining on you that you're reflecting, a bystander would see a bright flash of light.

But I could be wrong... With all those photons compressed together you might go Supernova. 




 See my answer. You're doing backup type #4 - system backup with Microsoft Windows proprietary backup format. 




 In the print options screen you can usually select grayscale, which will send print job containing no color information. Your printer should then only use the black ink. 




 There are different kinds of backups. From simplest to most complex:

1. Basic file backup - this just makes a single copy of your files. If your computer crashes you have to reinstall your operating system and programs but you can get a copy of your documents from the last time of backup. The benefit of this kind of backup is that the files on your external hard drive are exactly the same kind of file that you see on your computer's hard drive. You don't need your backup software to be able to restore a file. You can just drag/drop of copy/paste.

2. Basic file backup with timestamped versions - Like #1 except it keeps multiple changes of your documents. This is good for people who need to be able to restore a version of a document from a week or month ago, such as writers.

3. Mirror Backup (also called a clone) - This makes an exact duplicate of your hard drive. This can be used to completely restore your computer in the event of a drive failure but it's slow because your entire drive is copied during each backup. The backup's files are also plainly readable like with the basic backup.

4. System Backup - You can use this to restore the exact state of your computer just like the mirror backup. You can also have different versions so you can go back in history to selectively restore only a few files. The downside is that this is proprietary across different software so you need to have the software company's restore disc to recover from a failed drive. The files are also in a proprietary format so aren't plainly readable if you just wanted to quickly browse your backup and view some files. 




 Human evolution is over. Or it has slowed to such a crawl that it might as well be over. First, our ability to manipulate our environment, to cure disease, to modify our foods means that we don't have to wait generations. A gun means I don't have to outrun the mountain lion or bear any more. My coat lets me live above the arctic circle year round. My vitamins and my Kroger frequent shopper card lets me make delicious tropical fruit salads in the middle of winter.

Second, birth control has turned the mechanism by which evolution works--natural selection--on its head. In social after every social study, the individuals who are most well adapted to modern living are the ones having the fewest children. The well off are having few babies, if any at all, while the poor are breeding like rabbits. 




 The media absolutely must call out Rand Paul on his "many cases." Nobody should be allowed to make claims like that without being forced to give up proof. 




 Do you mean the other way around? Malware disguised as a media file?

It's possible but would probably rely on exploiting a bug in a media player. Not impossible, but unlikely. 




 Hmmm, I'm impressed they made the effort to be realistic. 




 ISIS is a guerilla group and are mixing in with the population. The west is not yet willing to accept the civilian casualties that would result from "steamrolling."

 Pedophilia isn't illegal and those suffering from it should seek treatment. It's the manifestation into acts that harm others that is illegal. 




 Ah, I misinterpreted. I think that a lot of leeway is given to the police officer by the review board. Where I live we have a community review board and it still lets a lot go. The judgment is not whether the officer made the *best* decision, but whether the officer made a *justifiable* decision. 




 I am really not a defender of cops. I just wanted to bring up the fact that we all suffer from cognitive biases. I actually think that the profession attracts a certain kind type of bullying personality. I certainly agree that police should and must be prosecuted and punished when there is evidence that the activity was illegal and premeditated. I think police departments should fire these kinds of cops when they find disturbing patterns of behavior, before it becomes a PR nightmare.

Police also just screw up. I'm glad I don't have a reporter calling me every time I write a bad bug into my code. This is something we also should be aware of. Then there's all the hazy area. Police are asked to make very tough decisions that could be life/death and make them very quickly. When I see one of those, I'm just thankful I don't have to be the one evaluating it. 




 This is part of the reason why I have yet to be convinced that self-driving cars will actually take off. For liability purposes, someone must be responsible for the actions and decisions of the car, and that person is the driver. This is how the FAA treats Boeing 777s and Airbus A380s that can fly themselves completely from takeoff to landing. The Pilot in Command is ultimately responsible.

As the driver in command of a self-driving car, you assume responsibility. I can see that it would become a more stressful driving experience around town rather than a less stressful one. Perhaps on a controlled-access interstate it might be relaxing, but I can't see it being relaxing in a city, even if the car was a much better driver than me. I would still need to pay attention and be ready to assume control. 




 Broken taillight. A very popular reason to pull somebody over, especially around the nightlife district. It'll happen until they also invent self-repairing cars. 




 Some tissues either repair very slowly or don't repair at all. Cartilage, for example, doesn't have blood vessels thus don't get the level of nutrients needed to reproduce quickly and repair. 




 When the only thing you hear are stories of people goofing up, you're going to think that it happens a lot more than it actually does. It's a proven cognitive bias and it's something that you should be aware of because you (yes, even you) are susceptible to it. In order to make rational evaluations of the community in which you live, you should be aware of the ways perception can let you down. I encourage you to listen to a few of David McRaney's podcasts of "[You Are Not So Smart](http://youarenotsosmart.com/podcast)." 

Hopefully this will lead you to explore the topic in greater depth, looking at actual data sets. 




 So your wipers don't get frozen to your windshield. It lets you scrape the ice off your whole windshield. By the way, flex your wiper blades along the entire length before you put them back down. This breaks the ice that tends to build up at the grip points where the rubber meets the steel. That ice buildup prevents the blade from conforming to the windshield curve which causes the streaking as the blade goes across the windshield. 




 The medical industry uses the term disease differently than your understanding. The DSM-IV calls addiction and dependence a brain disease. In medicine, brain diseases can be from a pathogen or could come from other causes such as trauma, tumors or hydrocephalus.

The reason why it's a brain disease is because the brain of a drug-dependent person behaves differently than someone else who is a non-user or a recreational user. Their brain produces less of a high in response to the drug (tolerance), and produces withdrawal symptoms when they get off the drug.

Lastly, I caution you about your viewpoint. Even those who have overcome their addictions through willpower understand how difficult it is and how easy it is for them to relapse. For many, it takes a lot more than willpower. It takes emotional support from their friends, family and community. Even with that, success is low. 




 It's a cognitive bias called The Availability Cascade. You don't hear about the times that a cop stopped a crime or a criminal because that's expected. /r/news articles that are unusual get upvoted but that tends to make those kinds of stories appear to be more prevalent than they actually are. That in turn promotes and encourages more of those kinds of stories to be posted. 




 The air doesn't decrease in temperature gradually as you go up in altitude. If stable enough it tends to form layers with boundaries. The same goes for ocean temperatures as you go down. The air mixes within the layers much more than it mixes across the boundary. Moist air condenses at the boundary, creating a flat bottomed cloud. 




 Israel *is* Palestine *is* Israel. History did not start 70 years ago. Until the creation of Israel, everyone in the area was called Palestinian, regardless of whether they were Muslim (80% of the population), Jews (15%) or Christians (5%).

Now, put yourself in the shoes of an Islamic Palestinian. You and generations of your family have lived in some house in a city like Jaffa for two thousand years or more. You've been ruled by Ottomans, then the British Mandate but you've always been Palestine. Then this guy comes along and suddenly says you're a new country, Israel (a Hebrew word), even though Jews were a small minority. Immediately, the U.S. and their western allies in the U.N. recognized sovereignty. You had no say. Suddenly, you're now living in a Jewish country.

The British initially supported the Islamic Palestinians and the Arab coalition (Trans-Jordan, Iraq, Syria and Egypt) but provided less than promised military support. The power-hungry King Abdullah of Jordan stabbed the Palestinians in the back because he made backroom deals with Ben Gurion to annex the West Bank. As such, he provided only nominal military support to the campaign despite being the most powerful military force in the region. 




 A college degree generally boosts your income over the rest of your lifetime (YMMV). Starting a business is riskier. Business loans are also often collateralized so you are going to risk assets like your home. 




 Jerusalem is important to Jews, Muslims and Christians. 




 The Palestinians did not the start the 6 day war or the 1948 war. They are caught in the middle. First, the country of Israel was just *declared* by David Ben Gurion. There wasn't any treaty between any parties. Western powers in the U.N. voted to recognize it so that it would be a place for Jews to go rather than have to accept post-WWII Jewish immigrants into their own countries. Prior to Ben Gurion, in the area that is now Israel only about 15% of the population were Jews.

The 1948 war and later the 6 day war were ostensibly over Palestinian rights but truthfully were political wars. Islamic Palestinians were the vast majority of the population but they were told by the Arab armed forces to flee the area, which they did. 700,000 of them. Israel won the '48 war and took the opportunity to basically lock the gate. The refugees were not allowed back into Israel (where they and their families had lived for millenia) nor into the neighboring countries and basically were stuck in the west bank, which was taken over by Jordan. Later, after the 6 day war, Israel took hold of that territory as well.

The Palestinians have been fucked by both sides throughout the history of this conflict. 




 Thanks. I never knew about ocular dominance. 









 Numerous studies show that Americans have been conditioned to identify the ".99" as being a bargain. Secondly, "9.99" also appears much less expensive than "$10.00" even though it's only by a penny.

As an aside, a ".95" are identified as being "a good value" (as opposed to the .99 bargain). 
























 But don't call it a "default."

 Does the spherical or squared off ends indicate one type over another?

 That's like saying brain surgeons are better than heart surgeons. Each of the racing sports are quite separate disciplines though they use much of the same principles. Rallye is fantastic and the drivers are challenged by very different conditions and have to interact with their navigator but they race against the clock. In F1, precision is key and the variation comes in having to adapt the best line to react to what the other drivers immediately around you are doing. 

Whichever they race, it takes thousands of hours of practice in that discipline to be competitive. Mika Hakkinen has been racing on a track since he was a kid, starting with kart racing.

 Hey fag, read this:  The minimum practical application range for salt is a pavement temperature of 15-20F and above.

You seriously are an idiot. Do you want the phone numbers for the Utah, Montana, Wyoming and Colorado departments of transportation?

Christ, why do I put up with idiots? 




 Here's a google of ['road salt temperature'](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant ion=1 espv=2 ie=UTF-8#q=road%20salt%20temperature). Read Google's answer. No DOT will dump tons of road salt at -6F just to watch it take hours and hours to turn it to slush which will re-freeze during the next precip. 




 If the high was only 0 Fahrenheit, salt can't be used because it's not effective. They use sand at that point. 




 Hydraulic fluid is used in control systems much like brake cables on your bicycle. Instead of cables, hydraulic fluid is used. When you push on the brakes in your car, the brake lines filled with hydraulic fluid transmits that pressure to the brake calipers at the wheel.

Hydraulic fluid can leak, causing you to lose pressure. Or you can get air bubbles in the hoses. Air is very compressible so it absorbs the pressure and makes the hydraulic system less effective. Hydraulic fluid also absorbs water. If enough is absorbed, the metal parts of the system begin to rust and can stick or bind. 




 Water is fairly transparent in the visible spectrum of light but it loves UV and absorbs lots of it. It absorbs UV at 10X visible wavelengths, if I recall. On a clear cold day there isn't as much water in the air absorbing the UV so more reaches the ground where it can get absorbed by the water on the surface. That water reaches a higher energy state and vaporizes. 




 Just because you have a 6 Mbps dsl speed on your copper line doesn't mean you are actually getting that. You are sharing the connection with your neighbors. Also, your download and upload speeds are very different. With a T1, you get the full 1.5Mbps, both up and down.

The price is high because typically a T1/PRI is leased to a customer who absolutely needs guaranteed capacity and reliability. 




 Cancer cells grow and divide rapidly. It takes a lot of fuel to do that. Cancer cells literally starve you, or rather they starve your good cells where the cancer is growing. If/when the cancer metastasizes and starts spreading, your body slowly shuts down as the cells that perform vital functions die. You don't die from cancer, you die from liver failure, heart failure, starvation, etc.

 Insurance companies are providing a service and taking on risk. Why shouldn't they be profitable? If insurance companies can be profitable while helping slow the rise of health care costs then isn't that good? They are private corporations that are competing against each other so hopefully they are being forced to constantly strive to provide better service at lower cost. They are also a force that helps control cost increases from pharmaceutical, medical equipment companies, doctors and hospitals that also want to be profitable. In my state there are also options from an ACA-marketplace insurance provider that is a non-profit. County health services are taxpayer funded and have no competition. They get the same budget regardless of how well they're meeting the needs of the community. I have a problem with that. 

It's certainly a complex issue but what we were doing hasn't been working too well. The idea of the ACA has been around for a long time and I'm willing to see if it produces results. 




 When you reach 65 or older, medicare becomes available for you. 




 But it's not limited to life threatening care. It has become the defacto doctor's office visit for everything from colds to head lice and I suspect it is the same for your county's emergency room, regardless of their official policy. These costs are a big burden for hospitals. The ACA has already resulted more people now have insurance than at any other time that the statistic has been measured. This will directly correlate to fewer emergency room visits, more preventive care doctors office visits. 




 The ACA says that insurers can not use pre-existing conditions to determine whether you can be covered and the premium cost. They can use age and whether you are a smoker.  




 Premiums have been going up by a lot every single year. For example, between 2009 and 2010--this is prior to the ACA rollout--the national average increase was 6.5%.

Under the ACA the premium increases between 2014 and 2015 were net zero nationally. Some states saw increases, other states saw decreases.

Source: [National Conference of State Legislatures.](http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/health-insurance-premiums.aspx) 




 You benefit from the same totalitarian government which has mandated to health care providers that if you visit the emergency room, they must provide life-saving care to you regardless of your ability to pay. This is health care that is not free. In fact, it's quite expensive and somebody has to pay for it.

How do you feel about that mandate? 




 Like everything else, currency responds to supply and demand.  




 Tighter winding produces bulkier cable and uses more copper. Copper is very costly right now. Plus, to be truly Cat6, the installer needs to terminate with shielded connectors and use shielded patch panels, which are costly and time consuming. 




 The list is just how I think money should be allocated. I'd rather take $50 from the money spent on skis to buy a $75 pair of gloves instead of a $25 pair.

Growing up, my fingers were practically frostbitten on some days. Now that I have some disposable income, I splurge on gloves and I find that it helps me stay more comfortable so I can ski longer and get more enjoyment.  




 Because they want to be the next place where Microsoft and Comcast builds tech support call centers. 




 Batteries, motor and magnet in the handle. 




 It's not meant to be the order that you buy things, but the relative importance you should consider when allocating how much money to spend on each thing. Splurge on things at the top of the list, at the expense of things at the bottom. 




 Except that if you're in the states you can't buy a new Defender. The 20 year old used ones go for minimum $25K.

 Wow. I did not know this. When it is resurrected next year I'm sure it won't be the same. 




 Your skis respond to the input from your legs and feet. If your feet move around inside your boot, it can't properly control your skis. You'll be wasting a lot of energy trying to control skis that are wandering. On steeper runs, things happen faster and there's less room for mistakes. In bumps and crud it's absolutely critical that you can instantly adjust your skis to the varying terrain. 




 I don't disagree with you at all. I ride motorcycles, bike and ski, always with a helmet. A lot of people think helmets reduce concussions but there just isn't much evidence to support that. I think it's important people know the limitations of the helmet. 




 That's a football study regarding a certain design. That design may eventually make it into snow sports but I'm talking about the recent evidence on ski helmets that are in use today.

Here's one:
The helmet does a very good job at protecting against skull lacerations and skull fractures, but it doesnt seem to have much effect on concussions or T.B.I.s, Shealy said, referring to traumatic brain injuries. Jasper Shealy, a professor emeritus at Rochester Institute of Technology, has been studying snow-sports-related injuries at Sugarbush resort in Vermont for more than 30 years.

From a recent [New York Times article](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/01/sports/on-slopes-rise-in-helmet-use-but-no-decline-in-brain-injuries.html). 




 That's pretty awesome DIY waterproofing 




 Where does grass fit on this list? 




 Yeah definitely, and I can't imagine skiing without one now. Helmets prevent a lot of kinds of head injuries but statistically they don't reduce the chance of concussions. :( 




 Patrollers still wear overalls but it seems to have fallen out of favor with everyone else. 




 Oh my hell. 




 A fitter can put some bolsters around your ankle area to get a tighter grip, or you can go with Intuition liners. That's really important! How the hell are you able to ski bumps if your heel is lifting in your boots???!!!!? 




 Part of enjoying what you do is feeling good when you're doing it. Foot complaints are probably #1 and it really holds people back from enjoying skiing. I think it's one of the reasons snowboarding has taken off. If you're starting out and know that you like skiing, invest in good boots that are appropriate for your level and get the liners fitted. You can even move some liners to new boots as you get better, as long as they aren't too compressed. Footbeds are also important if you have weird arches like I do. 




 I don't disagree with that. You should spend more than $20 on goggles but honestly I don't see (literally) much difference between $50 and $150 other than $150 buys you some sweet looking ones. I just put them below jacket because I think it's important to have a nice weatherproof shell with adjustable ventilation to handle lots of different changes in condition. But goggles could easily go above the shell. 




 Helmets don't do anything to prevent concussions. If you were going to get one you would have gotten one, helmet or not. It saved you from a nasty contusion, likely. 




 People's priorities are way off when it comes to where the money goes for ski equipment. 

Common priorities:

1. Jacket/Pants
2. Goggles
3. Skis
4. Gloves
5. Boots

It should be:

1. Boots
2. Gloves
3. Skis
4. Jacket/Pants
5. Goggles

With shitty skis and great fitting boots you can still ski anything. With great skis and shitty fitting boots, you won't be able to ski anything more than blue.

 The first computers had a very small amount of code called a bootstrapper that looked for software from an input/output device such as a punch card reader and load that directly into memory and start performing the loaded instructions. Thus the operating system could be coded into those punch cards. 




 There are only a few species that we know of which are self-aware like humans. The common test is the mirror test, where an odorless colored dot is placed somewhere they can't see on themselves but can in a mirror. A self-aware animal will react differently in the presence of the dot than without it.

Dogs and cats don't show much signs of being self-aware and I suppose that extends to their shadows.

 Most people know not to throw paper towels, tampons and pads into the toilet so it's not a big issue. These "flushable" wipes are marketed as being toilet-disposable. It's a godsend for parents. I'm guilty. Unfortunately, I now know they do not break down as easily as toilet paper. It's a major problem, especially in areas with older waste treatment facilities. I think you'll eventually see that term banned from their packaging unless the companies actually make them more degradable. 









 To get a sense of what is going to happen under extreme drought conditions, you can look at what is going on in Syria. In only 5 years of severe drought, from 2006 to 2011, millions of Syrians who subsist on farming lost close to 100% of their crops. This drove millions into the cities for work, creating social stress and unrest. Combine that with an oppressive regime and you get conditions that create groups like ISIS which has threatened the fragile region.

 Yeah, hard to condense a book down to one paragraph. :)

The reason why I included all the other things is because Diamond's premise is that they were sequential events. There is a lot more as well, domestication of animals as a reliable source of protein was huge. A population density high enough for rapid sharing of innovations, abundant sources of fresh water and water routes for trade, etc. But of course other cultures had that too. Europe was unique in that all of those things occurred on one continent. 




 Jared Diamond wrote a fantastic book about this called "Guns, Germs and Steel." 

Basically:  Europe was a wide continent (more latitude than longitude), which is important when you're dealing with climate and agriculture. As humans migrated across latitude they can bring the same seeds and make the same crops. This helped them succeed quickly. They made a lot of war, which led to a lot of innovation such as bronze and steel, maritime, etc. They endured a lot of disease and pestilence which allowed them to become fairly immune and carry disease to the Americas which wiped out the natives. 




 It came from a story about Theodore "Teddy" Roosevelt. He was on a hunting trip and as was customary, chasers cornered and tied up a bear to a tree for Roosevelt to shoot. Roosevelt said it was unsportsmanlike and didn't shoot the bear. Word spread around and a toy company made a stuffed toy bear. It became a very popular toy because of the popularity of the story.

 So what did your President do when he understood the toll that violent fanaticism took on individual lives? He used that sentiment to start a war that destroyed a country which had absolutely nothing to do with that attack and he did it with all of the support of the American Congress and the citizens.

Perhaps the point is belabored to you but I doubt most Americans have any idea what is going on outside their own city, let alone the world. This memorialization is trivial. Aside from the rescue personnel, what did the rest of the 3,000 people do that day? They went to work. The fact that they had no control over when and how they died is not a reason to spend vast amounts of money, time and resources to memorialize them. These 3,000 deaths is just as tragic as all of the innocent deaths in Iraq that resulted from American imperialism--deaths that still happen daily. People in Iraq die while going to work, every day. They get blown up and they leave behind survivors who grieve just as much as you Americans. Does any American give a shit? Not a single synapse in the United States is wasted on such a thought. The only time American fuck would be given is if a dollar could be earned doing so. American aid? For every $100 sent to Iraq, $95 came back to the United States in the form of lucrative contracts. Murica! Fuck Yeah! Your politicians build these memorials that you can bow to so it's easier for them to fuck you up the ass.

Not only is this memorial trivial, it's dangerous. You Americans have a history of using such memorials to launch wars, not only in 2012 but you also had "Remember the Alamo," used to launch an imperial expansionist land-grab war against Mexico. The world doesn't trust America and there shall be no apology offered for that.

Lastly, the fact that you Americans want to memorialize people who merely went to the office is the sort of American exceptionalism that people elsewhere find particular disgust in. If you check the pinterest and twitter streams around the world I bet you'll find a lot of photos of foreigners at this memorial giving the ol' thumbs up. 




 It sounds like you suddenly realized the answer. Congratulations. 




 You've hit the question that is at the heart of the matter. Why is government needed as the foundation of capitalism? What is the weakness of capitalism that you need government to correct? If you answer that question then you have answered OP. 




 There are 300,000 to 1,000,000 additional victims of 9/11 in Iraq that the New York Times forgot about. 




 Yikes! 




 Metal doesn't fatigue and weaken unless flexed beyond a certain limit. If the aircraft is well designed and you don't fly through extreme storm conditions, it can fly a really long time with regular maintenance. 




 Bacteria will turn milk bad very quickly at room temps. Cheese and yogurt is "bad" milk that we humans love. We introduce certain bacteria that produce flavors we like. They consume the lactose sugars before the bad bacteria has a chance to, and they often create acidic environments that inhibit that bad bacteria in the first place.

Meringue is egg white. I believe that bacteria feed mostly on the yolk so by taking the yolk out, the meringue has a longer room temp life. Not sure on this. 




 Why have government? 




 it wasn't meant to be a comprehensive history textbook. It was meant to show that there is another side to the story. Growing up in the United States and studying within the public school curriculum up through high school, you won't ever see "the other side." Zinn obviously meant for his book to prod people to question rather than accept. That's the kind of growth that college also provides to young adults. 




 I surely hope you don't think hypothetical questions are irrelevant. Political philosophers throughout the written history of mankind have been discussing hypothetical and unreal forms of government. I'm sorry if you don't see the value in doing so.

Regardless, I was addressing "freedom therefore capitalism." My point is that you don't want the kind of pure capitalism that would appear in a completely free state. There are problems in pure capitalism that must be redressed through creating a regulated competitive market and governed by an authority to which we give power to punish. No regulatory body will be perfect because there will never be a set of regulations that are perfect. Regulations, by their nature, are restrictions of freedom which we grudgingly accept to varying degrees. They will hurt some and help others.

jefferey1313 accepts both premises--pure capitalism has problems, government regulations have problems--but could not accept the conclusion that the system isn't perfect. The only way he can do that is by believing that there is a set of perfect regulations that can be administered by a perfectly functional governing body.

TL;DR: Is capitalism problem-free? On one extreme, pure capitalism  isn't desired by most people. So we agree there are problems. Now it's just a matter of drawing the line to balance regulation and liberty. 




 And around in a circle we go. You conveniently want to avoid talking about true freedom in an unregulated capitalist market, then you say that such a thing would cure the patent issue. Are you trying to have it both ways?

Do you want regulated competition? That means government.

Do you want unregulated capitalism? That's freedom, my friend. But that also means that if you come up with a better mouse trap, somebody (somebody with, say, more capital) can copy it and put you out of business tomorrow.

My point is this.  Your conundrum illustrates this weakness of capitalism:  An unregulated market will foster unfair competition. Regulated competition will restrict capitalism. 




 I guess I got caught up on the "freedom" part.

Anyways, I think you can give more credit to some people, maybe not all, but at least some. There is a /r/TIL today that discussed how Albuterol--an old asthma drug--was repatented and now costs over $100 per inhaler. Before, it was $15.

People also have issues with corporate greed trumping civility. Enron is a good example. Their tactics of purchasing a small amount of electricity allocation then reselling it back to localities at astronomical prices when the system was maxxed out and there were rolling blackouts was considered to be the ultimate in greed. Their tactics forced the electricity utilities to cut power in the middle of summer, raise prices sky high, forcing some people to choose between dying from heat exposure or not eating. 

Wealth is a great motivator. Nobody denies that. Bu there are also many examples of greedy, anti-social behavior due to capitalism. 
























 If you look at the mic/headphone plug, there are 4 sections. The headphone/mic jack has 4 conductors to handle everything separately:

* Left channel out
* Right channel out
* Microphone in
* Common

For a headphone that doesn't have a mic, there are only 3 conductors. The mic conductor isn't touching anything so there isn't any input signal to process. The phone senses this and leaves the on-phone mic turned on. 




 You are absolutely right. I meant my comment to be specific for this bill and re-reading my comment I can see that I was too generic, hence the confusion. The bill got filibustered. The Senate had 3 cloture votes on the House bill--maybe more, I stopped counting-- and all failed. 




 In the Senate, legislation requires a 60% majority (60 votes) to pass. Republicans don't have 60. 




 If it's not ridesharing, as Uber themselves and many others on this comment board have called it, then what is it?

Hint:  Starts with a "T." 




 [Uber drivers are getting 1099-Ks](https://tryzen99.com/blog_posts/read-uber-1099) starting this year. 




 1. Uber's drivers are 1099s (hired contractors).

2. Uber can fire a driver, which they do all the time. You get fired if your rating is below 4.2, if I recall. This means they're more than just a service. They're an employer.

3. Ridesharing would work this way:  I'm in San Diego and going to Carlsbad. I have a few extra seats and can give somebody a lift. I use Uber to make a few extra bucks. 'Cept that's not how it actually works. Uber doesn't tell the driver where the passenger is going. This is to prevent the driver from making a decision based on the destination. This completely destroys your belief that it's "ridesharing." Sorry to burst your bubble. 









 You get a pass because you're saving the planet. 




 I'm in Salt Lake City.

Even when you are in a 270 degree cloverleaf, you are probably doing 30 MPH when you come out of the turn and there's (i'm guessing) 500 feet or more before merging. Surely most cars can accelerate from 30 to 65 in 500 feet? 




 I guess that's probably the reason. They don't realize that it's the  relative difference in speed between two cars that makes a situation dangerous.  




 The tiny engine cars obviously aren't what I'm referring to. 95% of cars in the U.S. can easily be traveling at 65 MPH within 2/3rd of most freeway on-ramps. 




 Mostly to get announcements from the groups that I'm a member of and to get time-wastable news links from sources like IFLS. I also think it's kind of cool to see what my older, over-30 friends are up to. Before, I would only see them maybe a few times a year and in those times we usually forget half the important stuff that has happened since the last time. 




 Facebook is evolving. It's definitely not the platform it was one or two years ago. It's not the communication platform like it once was. I've noticed a lot of changes in what people are posting now. Video has really taken off and FB has done a really good job incorporating it. I think FB is like Vine + Pinterest + Twitter, but not necessarily better than any of those other sites at what they do. It's just a kind of one-stop-shop. 




 I think 3.6 will suffice. 









 Comcast customers were reporting shitty Netflix streaming. User testing gave [proof](http://www.measurementlab.net/static/observatory/M-Lab_Interconnection_Study_US.pdf) that Comcast was throttling traffic from Netflix. Comcast denied, denied, denied. 

Netflix caved and [paid a ransom to Comcast,](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304834704579401071892041790) suddenly no more problems. Netflix also signed a similar agreement with Verizon--who was doing the same thing--a couple months later.

Netflix complained to the Feds, which started the ball rolling on reclassifying broadband as a utility to maintain net neutrality. 









 Why doesn't the U.S. retaliate by raising tariffs on cheap Chinese goods? 









 Imagine two people on a moving train and they are throwing a baseball to each other. If you're on the train and watching them throw the ball, it wouldn't look any different than if the train were not moving.

The airplane is like that ball. It doesn't matter whether the Earth (which is like the train) is moving or sitting still. 




 Thanks, that's helpful advice. 




 What's your commission rate for full commission, and are you under sales goals? 




 That's really helpful. So you like all commission rather than base + commission? It seems like it would appeal to confident and aggressive sales people. 




 I will be hiring salespeople for a startup software company and I want to get feedback on how you like your commission structure, or whether you even have one. Do you help set your sales goals and do you think they are realistic? 




 Then they should go get skillz. Software support positions *start* in the 40s, green developers are getting 70s and sometimes 6 figures.

If somebody's attitude is to say "fuck you" then that's probably why they're stuck at minimum wage. 




 Why should every job pay a living wage? Minimum wage jobs are not considered skilled jobs. They are jobs that unskilled people can work at to gain experience and develop a good work ethic that will help them advance in their careers.

Society will always and should always have jobs that are not going to pay a living wage. A living wage is the incentive to do well at your job and get promoted or get better employment.  









 True, the 1948 war was such a huge factor. King Abdullah I of Trans-Jordan was promised the West Bank in a secret deal so he held back a lot of his forces and never fully committed. To me, that was the most critical piece. Israel was on the brink. There were so many ways that could have played out but the chips fell a certain way because of politics, which Israel played masterfully. 




 Before World War I the entire middle eastern region was a part of the Ottoman empire. Ottomons began as orthodox christians but transitioned to Islam. They were benevolent towards non-muslims, and granted them religious freedom. For most of the 2nd millenium AD the religious makeup of the empire was mostly Christians though the rulers were muslim. Islam gradually grew through the population and became the majority. There wasn't really much religious animosity in the middle east during this time.

The ottomans backed the wrong side and were defeated in WWI. A power vacuum was created and the British were given control of the middle east in what is called the British Mandate. They drew arbitrary lines creating countries without thought to ethnicity, which started the trouble. 

After WWII the British ended the mandate and gave up control. A guy named David Ben Gurion dreamed of a Jewish state and had been pushing for it through the first part of the 20th century. He saw the withdrawal of the British as the perfect opportunity. He worked with the Mandate to create a Jewish, muslim and christian state in Palestine but the borders were never finalized. There was massive jewish immigration out of Europe during WWII, escapees of the holocaust. England and the U.S. were the primary recipients of the immigrants and this was creating a lot of political tension. Ben Gurion promised that a Jewish state would attract Jewish immigrants, taking the pressure off them, so his plan became a desirable solution for the U.K. and the U.S. as well. As soon as the British handed over control (literally on the same day, if I recall), David Ben Gurion declared the Jewish State. the U.S. and U.K. immediately recognized the state, much to the anger of Islamic palestinians who were living there and who were the majority. (I believe Jews were about 15% of the population at the time.)

TL;DR:  Jews, christians and muslims have been living in the area for thousands of years in relative harmony. David Ben Gurion declared a Jewish state when the British vacated control, and the U.S. and U.K. recognized the State, and convinced the U.N. to follow along. Muslims pissed ever since. 




 When the U.S. Constitution was written, a representative democracy was a new concept from the enlightenment but was completely untested. The founders were well versed in history though, and Roman history showed the dangers of populism in a republic. To mitigate against the possibility of the people really screwing up and electing some popular tyrant, they created the electoral college. The belief is that the college would be more thoughtful and could override a bad choice by the voters should they feel it necessary. 




 Who's arguing? I wrote what I believe and respect that others may disagree with me. To me, it's more than semantics and calling Professor Hawking a mathematician is like calling Thomas Wolfe a linguist instead of an author. But again, that's just me. I'm not here to force my viewpoint nor am I passing any judgment on physicists, mathematicians, linguists or authors. They all do different things that have some overlap. 




 When your body starts feeling cold the blood vessels to all of your extremities begin to constrict, including your penis. This helps keep the blood circulating around and warming the most vital organs to protect them. Your penis doesn't have bones or cartilage. It's size all comes down to blood being pumped into it. When the blood leaves, it shrinks. 




 To add to this and help define irony:

Irony is just communicating a thought by saying the opposite thing. Describing your new Mini Cooper by saying "It's sooo HUGE!" is an example of this.

Sarcasm is using irony in a critical way. Example:  Your friend walks into a tree and you say "That was smart."

The difference is your intent, whether it's just to be funny or critical. 




 Stephen Hawking is a theoretical physicist, not a mathematician. The discipline seeks to explain the physical world using math since a lot of it isn't directly observable.

 Imagine you're sitting in a moving train passing another moving train. Both trains are on the Earth, which is rotating. The Earth is revolving around the sun. The sun is moving through the galaxy. The galaxy is moving through the universe. What's your absolute speed? It's an impossible equation. You can only measure speed in relation to some other object--how fast your train is passing the other train--but not how fast you are moving through the universe. 




 Sand is a great desert topping too but, alas, not a good foundation.

 This is probably a topic for [/r/askreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit). 




 All celestial bodies except black holes emit radiation. That radiation is comprised of many frequencies depending on the matter that it's made of and it's not hard to figure out what those frequency components are. When bodies are moving relative to each other, those frequencies get shifted slightly due to what's called the Doppler Effect (think of a train passing you and the noise it makes as it's approaching vs. traveling away). The faster they move the more the shift is. By looking at a spectral graph of a celestial body we can calculate the speed at which it's moving away or towards us from that shift.

There is no true speed, only speed in relation to a point or another celestial body (such as our Earth). 




 You can program a PBX to display pretty much anything you want for caller-ID. And sometimes a PBX is misconfigured so it displays an extension number that can't be dialed-back. It's best to make it a policy to ask so an emergency dispatcher can make it a part of their routine. There's already enough to think about without having to decide whether to ask for somebody's phone number. 




 Computers use binary computation because it's really easy to just consider an electrical signal as either on or off instead of splitting a voltage into, say, 10 possible values which would greatly increase the chance of making a mistake when reading the signal's value. In a binary math system each digit in a binary number increases the range by a factor of two. A single digit has two values, 0 or 1. A two digit binary number has four values, a three digit number has eight values, and so on ad infinitum.

The bytes and kilobytes refer to memory, either RAM or on a hard drive. You reference data stored in memory by referring to the *address* of the data, i.e. where that data is stored (addresses are sequential, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.). Computers use binary values for addresses. If you were using 8 digits for addresses, you can have up to 256 memory locations. A 10 bit address has up to 1,024 (a.k.a. 1K) locations. A 16 bit address has 65,536 addresses (a.k.a. 64K). 









 She'll make somebody a nice husband. 




 Thinking about it more, I think the answer is this:

You are right, but the only place where the forces count is right at the mouth opening, not at the tip of the noodle. Where I got stuck is thinking that because the noodle is a cylinder, the pressure can only act on the end of the noodle. But in actuality, the pressure is acting on the cross section of the noodle right at the lips and it doesn't matter how long the noodle is.

I'm not 100% on this explanation but it's better than anything else I can think of. 




 Thanks for the diagram and really, thanks for taking all the time to explain. Your diagram is what I was thinking too but I just don't think it's a satisfactory answer. Here's why.

Imagine an *infinite* noodle. If it has no end, this explanation would conclude that an infinite noodle couldn't be sucked into your mouth. Of course, I haven't tested this hypothesis but my gut says that's not the case, that indeed you can keep sucking an infinite spaghetti noodle. Then there's the problem of pushing on the end of a limp spaghetti noodle--I don't think you can make it go where you want it to go.

This is why I threw this up on ELI5. I can't reach a satisfactory explanation by myself. 




 Ya Paint sucks. Google draw is only slightly better but meh, it works for this kind of thing. I sent a request for permission. 




 Because it's in the Constitution. 




 Or rather:

Things don't suck. They blow.

Physics geek t-shirt idea! 




 I understand the beer bottle bursting. I wasn't thinking of the cap or the end but the midsection. the pressure is pushing on the bottle wall. The bottle bursts outward. *I get it.*

Maybe [this will illustrate](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1e24LQwskqeEmaX8R3DhFMYXKXnbaQ4UzBWZu3XJ4EOs/pub?w=960 h=720) my question better than my words thus far.

Edit:  Imagine a piece of paper on a table. For my hand to slide that paper across a table, there must be friction between my hand and the paper. If it were frictionless, I would not be able to move the paper across the table. And that friction is, of course, created by the roughness of my skin and the paper. 




 Oh shit, my ass is on several hard drives. 




 The beer bottles I understand. Its surface is orthogonal to the direction that it bursts. You push on a flat surface, it moves in the direction of the force. How does that translate to the noodle, whose surface is cylindrical but parallel to the direction that it moves? 




 So the air pressure is acting on the roughness of the noodle. *If* the spaghetti noodle had a perfectly smooth surface, you couldn't suck it in, right? 




 Sorry, misspoke. I meant air pressure, not force. 




 That air pressure must have a surface to push on, right? A noodle is cylindrical so there isn't any surface can accept a force which pushes the noodle inward.  Well, except for the very tip of the noodle. 




 ^^^ What he said. I meant *air pressure* forces. 




 Oh boy that's an entirely different beast. Nobody knows how gravity actually works, just that it does. 




 Having a hard time wrapping my head around the "fluid" part. I can push an uncooked spaghetti noodle but have you tried pushing a limp one? Doesn't work so well!

Edit:  Oh you mean like water through a straw? Fluids aren't compressible so if they are constrained in a straw then they can behave like a solid. 




 Edit:  I mean *air pressure* forces can only push, not pull. 




 Even if a solo pianist has played some piece a hundred times, it's never plays the same way twice. The same goes for a good orchestra, but it would all sound like shit if every musician did their own thing, holding some notes longer than before, playing some parts louder or softer than normal. A conductor is needed to be the creative force during a performance. Good musicians are needed who can respond to the conductor's cues and make it all come together. 




 It could be a honeypot as well. 




 HDMI and DVI are both digital video standards but there are two differences that will explain why desktop PCs tend to use DVI rather than HDMI. First, most DVI ports also provide analog signals and HDMI does not. This means you can connect a VGA cable to a DVI port using an adapter. Since many existing monitors are still analog, this was an important design criteria for desktop PCs. 

Second, HDMI carries audio. This is really important for signals going to a TV since all of them have built-in speakers. Most computer monitors, on the other hand, don't have built-in speakers since most PCs use external speaker systems.

There's more demand for HDMI on laptops because people are more likely to plug laptops into TVs since they are more portable. Few people will unplug their tower, keyboard and mouse to take it over to a TV. But you'll notice that even laptops that have HDMI ports will also have a DVI port. (Yes, there are exceptions, I know.) 




 The amount of debt is one piece, interest rates are another, and currency is yet another factor. Debt rating is a measurement of the risk of default. U.S. government debt has one of the best debt ratings in the world. The U.S. dollar is also highly sought because its value is stable. All of these factors make the amount of debt less of a factor to the U.S. than that amount would be to another country who doesn't have as favorable of conditions.

Debt isn't necessarily a bad thing if used well. Let's say you invented the SuperWidget 2000. By yourself, you can make one a day, around 250 a year without working weekends. Let's say a rich uncle saw one of your widgets and is willing to help you grow your business by loaning you money at less than 1% interest to build a factory, buy machinery and hire and train workers to build the SuperWidget 2000. Now you are employing 100 people and building 100 a day. Your income has gone up 20X, thanks to your uncle. You would be crazy to turn down that sub-1% loan. That's exactly what the rest of the world wants to do. U.S. pays interest rates in the 0.1 to 0.3% range on our debt.
 




 Default is when you don't pay. The debt doesn't all mature at once, just like your mortgage that has monthly installments. The U.S. debt has varying lengths. The debt limit is completely made up my Congress.

 I don't have a problem with wanting to believe in God as long as they respect other religions and non-believers. I feel the joy of love as much as anyone else. I hurt as much as anyone else when my mother died. Just because I know that emotions are synapses firing in my brain doesn't make it any less powerful to me. I also feel sympathy for others, no matter what they believe in. To me, it's not religious. It's just being human. If I ever join a religion it would probably be Unitarianism. 




 I apologize if anyone took it that way. That was not my intention. 




 Generally, you're not allowed to shoot somebody unless you can make the case that it's self defense, that you feel your life is being threatened. In most states, feeling that your property was being threatened doesn't rise to that bar, and it certainly doesn't if the person is in the act of fleeing, regardless of whether they are carrying your property. 




 How much time did it take for you to realize that Star Wars was a work of fiction? That's about how much time it took for me to realize the bible was a work of fiction.

 If you have bought anything, you've paid taxes (at least in most states). If you live somewhere, even if you rent, you pay taxes (your landlord passes these costs to you). If you are employed, even at minimum wages, you pay taxes (your employer withholds these and they also pay employer contributions that you don't see).

If you're an adult, chances are high--very, very high--that you pay taxes. 




 There are a lot of great companies, many started and staffed by some very hard working and entrepreneurial people. That's a big part of the equation but not the only part. One of the reasons why you can earn that money is because taxpayers and government helped create an environment with good infrastructure, regulations and laws that foster and protect free market competition.

 Living in a desert, I'm always interested in saving water and energy so I wanted to see if the cold pan method of cooking pasta would yield good results. I first learned about it from Chow.com, [here.](http://www.chow.com/food-news/94799/how-to-quickly-cook-pasta-in-a-frying-pan/) 

The danger of not using enough water is, of course, sticky pasta so for my first attempt I used whole wheat pasta which has less starch to begin with. I made one serving (3 oz. dry pasta) and used an 8" skillet. I broke the pasta to make sure it fit, which I don't mind. Purists may balk. I added enough water to cover it with a healthy amount to account for absorption and loss to vapor. It was probably around 3 cups (350 mL ?). 

It got to boiling pretty fast. [Here is a photo](http://i.imgur.com/s7H1WdL.jpg) of it cooking. I stopped short of al dente by a couple of minutes to drain and reserve the pasta water. I added my marinara and finished cooking, re-adding pasta water as necessary. 

The results were damn good. The sauce was thick and clingy and the pasta didn't stick. [Here's the finished dish](http://i.imgur.com/3TXfoUw.jpg) with some grated parmigiana and basil.

Edit:  In case anyone was curious, I ended up tossing away less than 2/3rd cup of water. 




 The Windows 10 computer icon looks like an iMac? 




 Not really. Look at Google's design guidelines. Metro and Windows 8 began to popularize the flat design, with little use of gradients. Jony Ive took iOS in that direction. There are so many devices now. Apple's UI and Google's guidelines emphasize a very clean look with minimal distractions that work well across a lot of different screen sizes and resolutions. To me, the Windows 10 iconography stays within those design principles.

 Here's a story of an expat who was beaten to death by customs officers for not paying the bribe.

*At Dhaka airport there is a gang of police and customs officers who supplement their pounds 80-a-month salaries by demanding between pounds 30 and pounds 50 from returning expatriates.*

*The general consensus, supported by a leaked CID crime report, is that Mr Miah was murdered, almost certainly by being beaten to death.*

*Humayen R Choudhury, the parliamentary speaker, doubted that the vast feudal pyramid of corruption could be breached, saying: "I know that people are treated very badly at Dhaka Airport, and we want to change that, but I imagine that you will come up against a brick wall when you want to talk to customs officers."*

[The Independent](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/death-at-the-airport-exposes-web-of-corruption-in-bangladesh-1308111.html)

 *Sales of gold have long been an important source of funds for the North Korean regime, which has been largely cut off from the global financial system by sanctions imposed to curb its nuclear-weapons program.*

*Kim Kwang-Jin, a former banker for the Pyongyang regime, said North Korea could have been moving the precious metal in an effort to find buyers.*

*North Korea often uses diplomats to carry cash and other valuables, defectors and diplomats say. Increased sanctions and scrutiny of official bank accounts have increased the need for secret movement of items in this way, they say.*

 I ask because tonight when I sat down the server asked if we wanted appetizers. I hadn't had a chance to look over the menu yet but I asked her "do you have a meat   cheese plate?"

"Yes!" she said.

"OK, we'll have that."

She brings two plates. One with the charcuterie, one with the cheese. In my continuing nave-ness I thought "hmm, why two plates," but didn't say anything. I realized when I got the bill that the meat   cheese plate was a meat plate and a cheese plate. $20 each.

It was delicious though. 









 $1.4M is not really that much gold at todays prices. This guy was probably a courier for one or two high ranking government leaders and was just going to trade it for cash. Because of economic sanctions, North Korea has very little foreign cash. You need cash--like U.S. Dollars--to buy/import foreign goods. There are people who will sell you anything--Mercedes, Fendi purses (popular with the first lady), Armani suits--but they won't take the North Korean Won.

The reason why he got caught is because he didn't make any bribes or didn't bribe the right people at the airport. Arguing diplomatic immunity won't get you anywhere but if you slip enough money into your passport you could get almost anything through customs in a 3rd world country.

Be honest. You can't imagine how it feels if it hasn't happened to you and it's OK to just say "I can't possibly imagine what you're going through." Any sentence that starts with "I wish" isn't going to be all that helpful.

It's a sad time but it's also OK to smile, laugh and even joke--"Your mom would not approve of that shirt for her funeral." Sometimes dark humor helps crack the tension. Again, you know your friend, I don't. 




 I'm guessing the reason why you're agonizing over pennies is because of what your parents did during your upbringing. In between the lines I think you sense that as well. One thing I've learned from my own therapy is that family of origin baggage is heavy.

Treat yourself to one or two brand name things every grocery trip and increase that as you feel comfortable with the fact that it really doesn't make a shits worth of difference at the end of the day. 




 Apparently I put it in the glove compartment and it flipped over the top and fell behind the compartment when I shut it. The glove compartment was probably too full of shit but still, a crappy Chevy Astrovan design. The guy had taken out the center console to do some work in there and found my wallet. 




 I did, just not there. 




 People had insane topiary gardens. 




 It's just data. What we make of it is purely our own invention. The data is just data. 

If instead of circles they were bombs or tanks then the illustration would have been perhaps too politicized. But as it is, it's a just a standard way of depicting relative values and, to me, unworthy of being called "beautiful." 









 They have to monetize for the investors or else the founders will get the boot. 









 Thanks! 




 It also means that the officer has at least reasonable suspicion which allows him/her to ask more questions to determine probable cause. 




 Good advice. I just want to add that if you are actually being detained on reasonable suspicion or probable cause, you can state to the officer that you have an attorney. At that point they are supposed to end questioning until your attorney is present. 




 Unless you are being detained, the only thing you are required to give police is your name and any identification if they ask for it. You can refuse to answer any other questions and a refusal will never be used as any evidence of guilt in court. But you should always do so in a courteous manner or else you may give the police something to arrest you for.

That said, keep in mind that cops are just trying to do their jobs. Yes, I have heard the horror stories of some pretty big assholes in uniform too. But the vast majority just want to keep things under control. Sometimes they are responding to citizen calls about suspicious activity and they want to make sure that you're legit. They would probably appreciate clearing you quickly so they can move on to trying to find the actual person the caller was complaining about.

Even if you think the cop is overstepping his authority, you should comply but clearly state that you object to having to do it. The court will not allow any evidence gathered from an illegal search if it ever gets that far. 




 You have a good point. I was so entranced by his movies I wasn't thinking. 




 Kind of like Vince Vaughn? I think it would work pretty well actually. 




 I think OP is thinking fried spring rolls. That's the term most used in trendier restaurants and vietnamese or thai restaurants because "egg roll" is too associated with crappy Americanized Chinese restaurants.

To answer OP's question:  Fresh spring rolls are made from softened rice paper, has fresh veggie ingredients and pre-cooked meats inside (shrimp or pork usually). Fresh spring rolls are not fried. On the other hand, fried spring rolls is ground meat and vegetables rolled in a special spring roll paper that fries up crispy and deep fried. A chinese egg roll -- I'm talking the crappy restaurant kind -- is usually some kind of meatless cabbage filling inside the same fried spring roll wrap, and it's deep fried as well. 




 They want to tap into your impulse buying habit. They don't want you to think which your mind can't do as well when it's trying to process the auctioneer. It's also a way to increase the speed and thereby increase the pressure on you. 




 The chemical structure of the different plastics isn't anything that nature has ever made so there are no organisms that consume it or can break it down and it doesn't rust or dissolve. Plastics, theoretically, last forever under normal circumstances and they never get recycled back into nature. Personally, I think we will eventually see the evolution of micro-organisms that can feed on plastics. It may take a million years though.

Petroleum itself isn't bad. It's the byproducts of combustion that is bad. CO2 in the atmosphere soaks heat instead of allowing it to dissipate into space, causing the Earth's surface temperatures to rise and altering the climate. Particulates like soot get into our lungs and are carcinogenic. 




 A reasonable doubt is when you're not convinced because there are other possible explanations that the prosecution could not effectively dismiss.

A trial generally goes like this:  The prosecutor has a theory and they show evidence to support that theory. Time lines, weapons, blood stains on the defendant, eyewitness testimony, etc. The defense attorney tries to introduce "reasonable doubt" about the most critical pieces of evidence. The defense doesn't have to come up with a competing theory though ideally it would be helpful if they could. The defense attorney will try to show that perhaps the eyewitness was too far away for a positive identification, or that the time line would be too difficult to accomplish. Basically, anything to have a majority of the jurors say "hmmm, maybe he didn't do it." 




 You're being rational. Knock it off. 




 I love how his opponent just rubs his hands together in glee after making the counter move. 




 I'm not putting any blame on the municipalities, and I get what you're saying. I think they would benefit from more education of their community of the effects of trying to grind everything in the sink disposer. The rice in the photo is a perfect example of stuff that should have and very easily could have gone into the garbage bin. 




 All you have to do is go up to a cop, kick him in the balls and yell "Don't tase me Bro!!" 




 It would only be used to catch bad guys. I promise (wink). 




 Municipalities should do a better job of teaching homeowners. The solids that goes into your sink just gets filtered out and taken to the landfill anyways. Homeowners can save themselves potential problems and also be friendlier to their sewage treatment if they just scrape their leftovers into the trash instead of the garbage disposal.

I haven't had a garburator in 15 years and haven't had any clog problems. 




 There are a lot of people who will take a story like this, fill it in with fictitious stuff they've seen on CSI, and think that a processing a rape kit will somehow magically deliver incriminating and irrefutable evidence of guilt. 

All I can say is:  Keep fighting ignorance. 




 Can I get the plans for that for my 3D printer? 




 Maybe she was cold but if somebody is so frail that they can let a single sentence push them to suicide then I think the problem isn't with the girl. 




 Unmatched DNA doesn't go into any database so this just isn't going to happen, at least not today. It would be an interesting database to have though. 









 Besides the storage issue which has already been covered, the other difference is that video is being processed at N frames per second whereas a camera (even a smartphone) can afford up to a couple of seconds to process and store a single image. The processing power of the security camera or the DVR affects the resolution and quality of the image. 




 I agree with that 100%. The issue I have is that people are demanding that *all* rape kits get processed. That's needless yet that happened recently in Salt Lake City. The city council and police department caved to the political pressure. Money/time/resources will be needlessly wasted. 




 You let the dough sit and rise to allow the yeast work its magic. The yeast is converting the carbohydrates into carbon dioxide which will gives the bread its bubbles when it bakes. The rise will also give bread a different, less floury flavor. 




 In a case where the assailant is not known by the victim then it can lead to a match in a database. It's worthwhile in those circumstances and detectives will almost certainly order processing of the kit. But if the detective already knows who the accused is and they don't dispute that they had sex with the victim, why process the kit? The latter is the majority of rape cases.

For wrongful convictions the defendant can always ask for processing and they can also employ an independent lab to process it. 




 Most of the time it doesn't because the accused are known by the victim and there isn't any dispute that sexual intercourse took place. It comes down to consent/non-consent and processing a rape kit does not help resolve this dispute in any way whatsoever. 




 In most cases, the accused is known by the victim. Processing a rape kit isn't needed if the guy admits to having sex with the victim. The rape kit can only help resolve who the rapist was if the assailant is unknown or the accused disputes having sexual contact. It doesn't help in he said/she said cases and is just a waste of resources.

(Edited to clarify wording.) 




 Backlog aside, as a cop (I assume you actually mean detective since cops police and detectives investigate), tell me what goes into the decision to request rape kit processing vs. not requesting it. 




 Why? Serious question here. 




 My cop bro went through it at the academy. In his video they're all laughing. You can't help it. But he said it's a good lesson, exactly for the reasons Jashinist said below. He said he never wants to go through that again. 




 Shit, that's bad reddit form on my part. I gotta get it off his phone...  




 Damn, that sucks. 




 My bro is a cop and he had to go through this at the academy. His video is fucking hilarious. 




 Synthetic oil is not actually synthesized. It has its base in crude oil from the ground, just like conventional oil. It just has been refined to a more pure product.

Edit: Adding an [explanation](https://mobiloil.com/en/article/car-maintenance/learn-about-motor-oil-facts/synthetic-oil-vs-conventional-oil) from Mobil. 




 For a quick primer, listen to [this podcast](http://backstoryradio.org/shows/body-politics-a-history-of-health-care/) from Backstory With the American History Guys. They are 3 professors of American history and they talk about how the whole idea of health insurance got started, how it evolved to be employer-based in the U.S. (you would never guess) and why it's different than the European model. 




 Yeah the COBRA law was a step in the right direction, as long as you could maintain your coverage. If you let it lapse then you got screwed. If you just lost your job and your prospects are pretty dim, wouldn't you understand it if somebody decided to let their health insurance lapse in order to keep their mortgage and house a few more months? 




 Yes, that's right. 




 But you'd still have to pay the premiums for that gap year, of course. 




 What hospitals are cutting budgets? Other than VA hospitals, I actually haven't ever heard of that. 




 I'm a self-employed 45 year old and I pay $450 per month for health   dental for just myself. It's an 80/20 plan (I pay 20%) with a $2000 deductible. It's a "Camry" plan. 




 [Top grossing for-profit hospitals](http://www.beckershospitalreview.com/lists/50-top-grossing-for-profit-hospitals-2014.html) in the U.S.

Some hospitals are [corporations with shareholders](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital_Corporation_of_America). Others are non-profit. At non-profit University of Pittsburgh Hospital, the CEO makes $6 Million a year.

[Why non-profit hospitals are the most profitable hospitals in the U.S.](http://www.arbiternews.com/2014/04/08/why-nonprofits-are-the-most-profitable-hospitals-in-the-us/) 




 I had one medical bill that was only partially paid due to a insurance screw up and it was on my credit report. I only found out about 5 years later (I don't apply for loans very often). I saw it on the report and called the collection agency to find out what it was. They told me who it originally was with (for some lab tests, if I recall). Funny thing is that after I called them, they started calling me and pestering me to pay the bill. I told them that I had insurance at the time and told them to take it up with them. This went on for months. 




 And prior to the ACA law ("Obamacare") your chronic condition could prevent you from even getting insurance. Cancer survivors in remission were frequently turned down if/when they lost their job and their group insurance. And if you had a chronic medical problem and a potential employer found out, it does sometimes affect their decision whether to hire you because it will raise their insurance costs. This is especially true for small companies whose premiums can jump wildly if you get one or two employees who are big health care users. 




 Hospitals also use this to maintain their tax-exempt status. Tax exempt hospitals "donate" about 1% to 2% of their services. They say "donate" but most of it is just uncollectible debt. But it's apparently enough to allow them to not have to pay taxes on their profits. 




 If you had absolutely zero assets then maybe you won't have to pay. But if you had a house, maybe a little bit of savings, all of that could get wiped out since your bills would be sent to collections who would start legal proceedings on that debt. The only you'll have going for you is that debtors prisons have been outlawed.

In the UK you will get prescribed painkillers and post-surgical rehab treatment that helps you recover faster, makes sure you can get around your house or apartment, and stuff like walkers and shower chairs in case you have trouble standing up or walking. In the US if you don't have insurance you have to pay full price for your drugs, any needed equipment and people to help you rehab so you can get back to work.

The US is a totally backward barbarian society. But we're not the only ones. There's Rwanda, Uganda, El Salvador.... 




 I remember reading a long time ago about a Japanese guy who was unlucky enough to be caught in both the Hiroshima and Nagasaki detonations, very close to ground zero. After recovering he lived a long life with apparently not much side effect. I'll see if I can find a link....

Edit:  [Tsutomu Yamaguchi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsutomu_Yamaguchi) lived a relatively healthy life and died in 2010 at the age of 93 from stomach cancer. 




 Point taken. 









 If I ever meet the engineer who came up with the idea of counting the number of separation lines instead of the number of sections, I'll tattoo KISS on his ass. 
























 Not only that, this is self-reported and relies on memory of something that happened 10, 20 or more years ago.

Can we say "meaningless?" 




 What if I say:  "If you elect me sheriff, I promise to end all speed traps." How do you think that would go over, and how do you think drivers would respond? 




 Wait, wut? Platonic spooning is a thing? 




 If you knew how an election primary works then you'll understand why Congress doesn't give a fuck what "most Americans" want. They only care about the special interests that can mobilize enough votes (and it really doesn't take many votes or much effort) to defeat them in a primary. 




 I just don't think they were gullible. Sure, there are a few idiots in Congress but the vast majority are not dumb. They are very good at calculating but this was one time where their calculations were wrong. I believe many of them cast a Yes vote to authorize military force, not because they actually believed Iraq was any kind of imminent threat, but because they felt it was going to be a cakewalk and they didn't want to be on the wrong side of that vote. I count Hilary Clinton among that group. Indeed the invasion *was* a cakewalk. They just didn't count on the major fuckupery that happened under Paul Bremer, Douglas Feith, Paul Wolfowitz, Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney (dismantling the Iraq Army, disenfranchising Baathists, insufficient security manpower--none of that is the fault of Congress).

Again, that's not leadership. A leader would do what they really believed was right, not what they calculated to be politically expedient. I don't see any indication whatsoever that she is any different now than she was then. With her in the White House, it would still be more about political expediency than philosophical, moral and ethical structure.

I may still vote for her, but I'll be holding my nose while doing it. 




 I disagree. Scott Ritter, who was an UNSCOM weapons inspector in Iraq, was travelling throughout the country and all over the news prior to the Iraq invasion telling people that Iraq had no WMDs and no capability to make them. Congress knew (or should have known) that none of the 9/11 hijackers had any relationship to Iraq. The yellowcake story and subsequent attempts to link Iraq to 9/11 by the administration had already been discredited (look up Joseph Wilson and Valerie Plame).

If somebody voted in favor of authorizing military force against Iraq in spite of all of this, then it's clear evidence of a failure of leadership. 




 I also don't see much difference between my local Walmart and Whole Foods fruits and vegetables except the price. Whole Foods has better prepared foods, breads and bulk foods section (grains, nuts, dried fruits, etc). 




 God was probably proud of his son's accomplishments, especially when he treated lepers, the blind, the sick and the poor, all for free. 




 85% vs. 95% = 15% vs 5%. I think that's awful but maybe it's a glass half empty or full kind of thing. The glaring point about your comment is this:  Of the 85% who are insured the vast majority is employer-tied. Why the hell is it the responsibility of the employer to buy/subsidize health insurance for their employees? That's fucked up. If you were to design a health insurance system, no mentally stable person would ever say this was a good thing to do. 




 Lost in all of your approving comments is the sad fact that something like this has to be done in America. No other handicapped citizen in any other first world country has to worry about health care. 




 You break, you buy. Ask Murica. 




 Of course. Any middle eastern studies professor could have told you that, and many tried to tell Bush, Cheney and Rumsfeld.

ISIS is directly descended from the Iraq war. 




 Netanyahu wants to *increase* sanctions. Because that worked so well with North Korea?

Netanyahu's proposals would lead directly to military action. The purpose of diplomatic talks is, to put it bluntly, to get a diplomatic solution. The 7-Nation talks produced a solution that pushes the nuclear armament horizon from 2 months to 12 months, and includes constant monitoring and complete access. 

The goal of the diplomatic solution is to avoid the military warfare which actually *does* threaten Israel's survival.

 First, it really is a great map. Many commenters say that they wish they could do this. 

No you don't.

A perfectly working human brain forgets things. This is by design. The human brain is really good at separating the wheat from the chaff, identifying and paying attention to what is important to survival and reproduction. When your brain treats every bit of information the same and remembers it all, it's a curse not a blessing. 




 That's great!

 I'm asian, and I always find the "honor" and "heroism" argument of Japanese suicidal fighting to be specious. It's not heroism. It's actually a different form of cowardice.

 So did you think was he the breaking   entering type before all this? 




 When I started my business I signed a lease agreement for an office, and agreements for phone lines and internet. All of those agreements have early termination penalty clauses, as will the renewals. I was a dumbass.

 It has happened to me. A piece of firewood fell out of a pickup truck coming towards me on a 2 lane highway, bounced once on the road then hit my car. Smashed the windshield but fortunately it did not go through. My wife was in the car with me. We pulled over, looked at each other, said "Wow, holy shit." Then I turned around and chased down the driver and got their insurance info. The lady said "sorry" but wasn't all that upset about it. 




 Think about what you're selling. People buy solutions to problems. 

1. Identify the problem.
2. Come up with a sales pitch that presents you as a solution.
3. There are other solutions out there competing for the same customer. Make your solution the prized one. 




 Really? Seemed fine with Chrome 41.0.2272.104 on a MBP Core 2 Duo running Yosemite. 




 You will probably never get her approval because for her it's about exercising power and control. Her threat to embarrass you is an obvious clue that she is not rational. It's a war and she will threaten any nuclear option she has. Remember, she has had 22 years to learn your emotional weaknesses and she will exploit them.

Your choice is this:  Give in and reinforce her belief that she can control you through emotional torture, or withstand the onslaught, get battered, and emerge from this with her realizing that she no longer has that kind of power over you. That path will be very difficult but I believe you'll thank yourself in a year.

 Oh, WITHOUT A DOUBT. I think by the end he realized it too. That's why he and Cheney barely acknowledge each other now. He knows Dick fucked Bush. 




 I'm sure there are things about him that you wish were better. Maybe better abs, pecs, ass, hair, a bigger dick.

A relationship goes through these stages. At first, you are completely blind and see nothing but perfection. Then you see an imperfection, then a few more. Couples that make it through this stage find ways to accept their partner's imperfections and that is exactly what defines a successful LTR. It's not easy to do but that's also why most relationships fall apart. 

I think it's healthy to get these things in the open but talk about the fact that nobody will be a perfect fit to their partner's ideal but as adults, can you find acceptance with each other's perceived shortcomings. 




 Sure, OKC is used widely and without much incident. The fear is, of course, irrational but it exists. I read the study a couple of weeks ago, probably on reddit. I'll look for it.... 




 Recent study came out that most women on OKC fear that their first date will end up with them as different body parts in a dumpster. So I think this is a reason why a lot of women prefer FWBs over one night stands.

 Regardless of advisors, the President still makes the final decision.  




 Interestingly, some quite rational people believe that there is a segment of religious conservatives--mostly Baptists--who *want* war in the middle east because it will bring on the second coming of Christ. They will support any military endeavor in that region. 




 Vietnam here. Don't know what that is but it's not pho. With pho, the broth is added to a bowl of dry ingredients. It is never cooked in a pot. Certainly we don't add chopped scallions and bean sprouts to the cooking pot.

I'm not sure it's Vietnam (not a single cone hat to be found in the photo). *If* this is even Vietnam, it may be a soup like *canh chua* which is a sour soup. 




 This is the best response and should be upvoted more.

 Hahaha, is your petty little ego so fragile that a few up votes makes your day? How incredibly pathetic. "Good design is timeless?" Holy shit, are you in high school? Here's a secret that you'll learn when you actually get out in the real world:  You don't know if your design is "good" or "timeless." Nothing that is timeless was ever designed with that in mind because history judges that, dumbass. 

Here's the thing: You did not discuss Bebas Neue. You never even attempted to do so. You belched meaningless tripe in a sophomoric effort to be an anti-populist "cool kid." A reference to Emojis? Are you fucking serious? Guess what? Emojis have been around longer than you, my precious little budding teenage artist, and they will outlive any crap you manage to dump on humanity. Maybe that means they're "timeless" and therefore "good design."

If you can't tell the fucking difference between Bebas Neue and Helvetica, you have a long fucking way to go before your opinion is worth the toilet paper you use to wipe it off your ass. Go study like a good little student and maybe someday somebody will give a shit. 




 Ah, thanks for the info. The law was a Republican law (sponsored by Charles Grassley) that was meant to force Democrats into using the ACA exchange. Can we chalk this up to "unintended consequences?" 









 Actually, the problem is with you. I asked a question to get people's opinions. If you didn't have an opinion, just stfu. Instead, you assumed that I wouldn't use a font if I believed it was overexposed. You would be wrong. Assumptions make asses, and you proved the adage again.

You should care because you should know design styles and trends. This happens all over the creative world, whether it's visual arts, fashion or music. That doesn't mean you should limit yourself to only what is hot at the moment. Absolutely not. But you should keep up with what's going on in the world so you can stay relevant.

 Try fried shallots. You can get them from an asian grocery store for a few bucks a bagful, the equivalent of probably a few dozen shallots. I sprinkle them on salads and soups, add them to burgers (my secret burger ingredient). 




 I agree. I think red onion is still too sharp. Vidalias in salad is my preference.

 I first learned of the cold pan method of cooking pasta from Chow.com ([link](http://www.chow.com/videos/show/chow-tips/94799/how-to-quickly-cook-pasta-in-a-frying-pan)). My first time making it, I was worried that the small amount of water would cause the pasta to stick together so I chose whole wheat pasta because it has less starch. That pasta didn't stick so tonight I tried it again, this time with regular pasta. For the recipe I decided to keep it simple--butter, sea salt and parmigiana--and to reuse leftover supermarket rotisserie chicken from last night's dinner.

I measured out 3 oz. pasta, put it in my 8" skillet and added enough water to cover plus extra to account for absorption and vapor loss, around 2 cups, maybe a little more. I put the cold pan on the flame and it got to boiling within a couple of minutes. This time I started a timer when I reached boiling. Here's a [photo](http://i.imgur.com/ytqwcyV.jpg) of the pasta in the pan. While the pasta was cooking I shredded the chicken and minced some basil.

The box called for 10 minute al-dente. I tasted the pasta at about 8.5 minutes and it was almost there. I took it off the heat, drained and reserved the pasta water and added the butter and chicken ([photo](http://i.imgur.com/vOijXXf.jpg)).

I tossed everything together. The residual heat of the pan was enough to melt the butter and warm the cold chicken. I added back a little pasta water to keep everything moist. I seasoned with sea salt, black pepper, and added shredded parmigiana and the basil.

Here's a [photo](http://i.imgur.com/ayPjFlJ.jpg) of the finished dish. Elapsed time, about 15 minutes. It was delicious!

Notes:

* Part way through cooking there was no longer enough water to fully cover the pasta. I just stirred the pasta a couple of times a minute and I really didn't notice any effects from that. Next time I'll start with a little more water.

* Despite the very small amount of water used, the pasta did not stick together.

 




 This is kind of related. One of my rules is to try to find somebody who impresses me in some way. I've dated both--women who do and women who don't impress me--and it's a lot more fun with the ones who do. I accept it and embrace it as a part of my relationship and I make sure I let them know when they do or say something that is truly awesome.

 Only a couple of things, stir fry and steaks. 




 Why hasn't doner kebab caught on in the U.S.? Why? 




 Great ideas. I can see how you can do stock and cream based sauces pretty easily right in the pan.  




 Is it possible to make your own sugar free syrups, using Splenda for example? 




 Others have given great advice and recipes. I'll just tell you my story. The first dish I attempted for my wife as a noob cook was blackened salmon out of a recipe book given to us as a wedding present. Disastrous, as in smoke-alarms-going-off disastrous. She still loved me and appreciated it. Fortunately, I got better. 




 I start with oil in a cold pan and pre-heat it gently (medium). This evens out the heat and minimizes hot spots. I then turn it up to cooking temperature and add my ingredients when the oil starts to shimmy. 




 I agree with this. Stainless is never 100% non-stick and that's not a bad thing. You need both types of pans because there are are times when you want it to stick. When you are cooking meats and are creating a fond for a sauce or extra flavor, use stainless. If you are cooking something delicate like fish or eggs, use non-stick. 




 Honestly, I didn't time it since I knew I was going to be unsure with this method. I just went by feel. After I started cooking with the sauce I just checked it with a bite every minute. The whole process was really fast, 15 minutes or so to being fork-ready. This is just a guess but if you were to start a timer when the water started boiling, you wouldn't be too far off. 




 I sure did!  




 I second the shrimp stock, or even chicken stock. In Thai and Vietnamese cooking we strive for the 4 flavors:  Sweet, salty, spicy and brightness (acid). Add a little sugar, start with 1 tsp. You just want only a hint of sweetness. It is a good counterpoint to saltiness and spiciness.
