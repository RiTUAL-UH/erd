 "The Left hates the automobile because the automobile represents individual freedom and the Left hates freedom of any sort."

No. Most Democrats support manufacturing and domestic car manufacturing. To say that Liberals hate cars, isn't really the case. You may oppose a gas tax increase because it is a tax increase. Sure. People that want a gas tax increase to promote efficiency and pay the true cost of driving as stated in the article.

"For the leftist's ideal world, the roads would be reserved for government bureaucrats and leftist leaders while the disregarded masses would walk or take some form of overcrowded, filthy public transport."

Traffic tends to get really bad in city centers. Discouraging car usage is a good way to free up roadways. Freeing up Roadways increases car usage, so it is very inelastic in demand for car travel, which is good for slight tax increase because the deadweight loss is low. Look in the other countries with high gas taxes, people use public transit a lot and their infrastructure is considerably better than ours in many aspects. 

Yes, it will move some to public transit. Improving Public Transit and Putting Riders into Public Transit allows the government to make some revenues off of it. Also, it is environmentally friendly, since more people are placed in vehicles, so we don't waste excess energy in traffic or driving in excess to places, where you could have walked, take a bike, etc.  




 This isn't Appeal to Popularity. This is policy making and determining what most Americans want/support on an issue.

If the majority of Americans support legalizing marijuana, Is that Appeal to Popularity? No.  




 Yes, but conceding on Keystone will make the Republicans focus on Energy Regulations. They claim that Obama's high amounts of regulations are causing coal jobs to end in West Virginia, Kentucky, Appalachia, etc. Most Americans are opposed to removing regulations on pollution, toxic waste dumping, etc.  




 Not really. He should concede on Keystone, so Obama can have some agreement with the Republican Party on energy. Energy Production and Energy Extraction has been increasing under Obama's watch and it is helping the economy. Environmental Efficiency has been increasing as well. Politically, I can foresee Republicans using this potential veto in a a campaign to claim that Obama is "Anti-American Energy". During that last campaign cycle, Republicans used Keystone to claim Obama is anti-energy even though energy production has been increasing under his watch.

If Obama wanted to be bold, he should rather his position on TPP. 




 Bad Idea. I am pretty left on environmental issues, but I do know that more energy production and infrastructure is a good thing for America. 

Obama shouldn't veto Keystone. He should instead sign Keystone XL to show some bipartisanship. Why?

Republicans can't campaign against nor attack Obama on energy issues because they can't claim that Obama is anti-energy or his polices such as Keystone are the cause of rising gas prices. If gas prices start to rise in the next months and Obama did veto Keystone, How will Democrats, Liberals, and Obama respond to Republican Congress's claim that Obama is causing prices to rise?

Even if an Environmental Disaster occurs from Keystone, Obama can easily blame the GOP. After all, GOP wanted Keystone XL more than Democrats.  

Even though environmentalists will get angry from this, at least you will rally the base in 2016 and give candidates a chance to differentiate from the previous administration.  




 Either way, you can generalize that infrastructure spending in the stimulus is ranged from 50 to 100 billion dollars. It isn't most of the stimulus. It is definitely less than 25% of the stimulus 




 I wouldn't say all protectionism is bad. America up until the World Wars was on a protectionist policy. 




 Most people aren't advocating isolation. Most are just advocating for fair-trade standards. 




 Read what is in the Stimulus first: http://projects.nytimes.com/44th_president/stimulus?ref=economicstimulus 




 Honestly, just look at the detailed link of what the Stimulus was spent on.

http://projects.nytimes.com/44th_president/stimulus 




 Stimulus only provided at max 75 billion dollars for infrastructure depending the definition of infrastructure. There are tons of research and articles that will tell you how the Stimulus was spent. 1/3 of it was Tax Cuts. 1/3 was Health/Unemployment/Education/etc. 1/3 was random spending. 

By the way, our infrastructure is a 3 trillion dollar problem. 




 Farmers tend to use rail to send massive quantities of food stuff. I don't think mega farms are going to use truckers all the time.  




 Agreed. by the way, farmers tend to send massive food goods by rail. Trucks are used for short of medium distances to reach markets. 




 Infrastructure is mostly a government responsibility.  




 The problem of infrastructure is a 3.6 trillion dollar problem. The stimulus only addressed that problem with at max 100 billion dollars depending on the definition and criteria. 

http://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/ 




 It was less than 100 billion dollars and in the range of 40 to 75 billion dollars.

http://projects.nytimes.com/44th_president/stimulus?ref=economicstimulus

It is not enough to address close to a 4 trillion dollar problem.

http://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/  




 It was part of the Stimulus, if you didn't read the news back in 2009 to 2010 or looked into it. 

Here is how it was spent:

http://projects.nytimes.com/44th_president/stimulus?ref=economicstimulus

The infrastructure spending within the Stimulus is just minor patch to a major problem. Of course, we can't fix every problem, but less than 100 billion to fix a 3.6 trillion dollar problem isn't enough. 




 How does an ad hominem attack on Obama address Bernie's concern on infrastructure?

Obama's Stimulus was basically 1/3 Tax Cuts. 1/3 Health + Education + Unemployment Benefits. 1/3 Random other Government Spendings. 

http://projects.nytimes.com/44th_president/stimulus?ref=economicstimulus

Infrastructure Spending was only around 40 to 75 billion dollars in total depending on the definition of "infrastructure" in your own opinion.

It also provided some funding to build High Speed Rail, but most of the cash went to California, since states with Republican Governors rejected federal aid. 

By the way, repairing all infrastructure costs would cost 3.6 trillion dollars according to the American Society of Civil Enginners.

http://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/

Clearly, the stimulus provided only minor patches to a major problem.  




 I want to see which members of Congress will oppose this.  




 Generally, European Workers cost more than American Workers with vacation times, paid leave, maternity leave, higher minimum wages, more private sector unions, etc. 

TTIP is more for Europeans to worry about, but we should worry about it as well, but the anti-free trade agreement with TTIP has less points than with TPP. If anything, TTIP might bring jobs to America, while TPP, might outsource American jobs overseas.  




 It is easy to pack Democratic voters in to small districts because they tend to be densely populated or live in urban areas.  




 TTIP has a lot of benefits for Americans, so a lot of Americans aren't actually against this freetrade deal. Both regions are relatively similar in standards, so once we sign the deal, massive outsourcing won't necessarily take place. America compared to Europe has lower cost of productions in many areas some European Jobs will mostly likely be outsourced to America, but at a lesser rate than American Jobs to developing countries. 









 She should tell the truth in a way that doesn't make her look bad because you can't fully survive on a pure pro-Obama statement, when most of Kentucky disapprove of him. She could have responded back to the reporter and ask her, "Who did you support?" 




 I don't think it is the case with Mexico in NAFTA.

1. Mexican Illegal Immigration hasn't slowed as a result from NAFTA, even though promoters of the trade deal said so. People, who don't like manufacturing and are former farmers, migrated to America. 

I don't need evidence, since conservatives have been complaining about the increase in illegal immigration for awhile now.

2. Mexican Government isn't stable. The area is very hostile, violent, corrupt, and there is no signs of standard of living improvement.

I don't need evidence to prove this because there has been many gangs, violence, etc reported from the area. It is already widely known that Mexico has a lot of violent problems. 




 Big Businesses do have an easier access to the global market than small businesses, but it isn't corporate welfare unless the government is actually subsidizing to have the transfer of jobs to the region.

They have the ability to all market expansion and do cost-cutting measures.  




  False Dilemma

It is the same thing.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_dilemma

Either-Or fallacy works as well.

Sometimes those yes or no questions have motivations.

For example:

When a reporter asked Grimes whether or not she supported Obama, Grimes was put in a lose-lose situation. The reporter clearly had a motivation. Grimes should have sent back an either or fallacy question. 




 It may be advancement but the conditions in the industrial manufacturing Mid-West is so bad.

Those cities never had the ability to slower transfer to new industries. The former union workers and manufacturing workers are still struggling in cities such as Fint, Detroit, Gary, Buffalo, etc  




 I don't think there is a motivation agenda behind the pro-trade idea. There is tons of evidence to suggest that more trade = good, but it doesn't mean that sometimes protectionism can be better than trade. 

 




 If we continue with this "free-trade" process, soon we will sign free-trade agreements with every country to bring all countries's domestic prices to world price equilibrium. 

If all Domestic Prices are equal to the World Price, then what happens next? There is no gains from trade since every opportunity cost of creating a good somewhere else in the world is equal.

Usually, in free-trade agreements is basically abolishing national borders and national protectionism without actually abolishing sovereign borders itself.

Since, Free-Trade is so good. Shouldn't America be attempting to sign free-trade agreements with China, Russia, Iran, African Union, etc to allow low tariffs, easy transfer of laborers, etc?

Clearly, if we do so with those "hostile" or underdeveloped or growing countries, we could ease tensions, produce goods at lower costs over there, and "contain" the growing markets by making our businesses invest over there. 




 Actually you do. NYC and LA are giant metro areas. 1 team would completely monopolize a regional market, which isn't good.  




 Perot did support Romney in the last election. Probably, he felt that Romney was moderate enough for him when Romney was Governor. Though, I can't understand why he would think Romney is more moderate than Obama. 




 Sometimes, Questions can't be yes or no. it is False Dilemma when people can have multiple views, moderate views, agree with differences, disagree with differences, or concession with differences. 




 Interestingly, Ross Perot would be identified as a moderate liberal by today's standards.

http://www.ontheissues.org/Ross_Perot.htm 




 This trade deal will be important in this new Congress. This trade deal along with Obamacare, Foreign Policy/Military, Impeachment, Keystone, Benghazi, etc will be discussed from this GOP majority in the legislative branch.  









 To create drugs and new advances in medicine, it is usually best in competition rather than a single government controlling the findings. A lot of drugs and medicine have patents because those cover the cost of investment and time to find new advances in drugs/medicine/etc.

Of course, I agree that the all of society should be covered by healthcare. I just don't necessarily agree with the single-payer format.  




 I know but Healthcare isn't a natural
Monopoly, so there isn't a need for socialism in the insurance market or services in general.

From wikipedia "Automobile manufacturing became the largest industry segment in the US, and the largest ever created; the US auto industry was many times larger than the automotive industries of the rest of the world combined.[2] By 1960, one-sixth of working Americans were employed directly or indirectly by the industry, but automation and imports eroded the need for such a large workforce within a couple of decades. The 1950s were the pinnacle of American automotive manufacturing and helped shape the United States into an economic superpower." 

Of course, you can claim that wikipedia is not a primary source, but it does have source links on itself. It still summarizes the details well enough to understand the basic point. 

There, you have all the citations. 




 Single Payer would put too much accountability on the central government and states. It could lead to corruption. I don't support that, but I support mandated healthcare insurance or a public option vs private option.

 1. Our Agriculture Businesses were able to put some Mexican Agriculture businesses out of the market. Those workers had to either work in the factories or find some other opportunities. Many come illegally in search of better opportunities. Since NAFTA, Mexican economic/social climate, the new manufacturing jobs and social conditions aren't better than jobs and social conditions that they had before. 

2. You are talking about the producer and consumer surpluses, right? I understand that. It is just a transfer of welfare. If migration doesn't harm the US or Mexico, why do conservatives complain about the mass migration illegals?

3. For your third point, if you look at the graph, the trade deficit increased throughout the mid to late 1990s. In 1995, after we past NAFTA, we started to have a negative trade balance. It is -15,808.3 (add in the graph's key) compared to +1,349.8 (add in the graph's key) in 1994. Every year since to now, it has grown to -67,000 at its height. Those are HUGE number differences.

"It only ballooned in the 2000's, so tough to blame Clinton for this, right?"

Also, Clinton, Some Pro-Trade Democrats, and the majority of Republicans in Congress past NAFTA. I only blame the policy, but people, who agreed on it, each share a piece of the blame. 

4. Ya. Obviously, if you allow trade without guidelines, tariffs, quotas, etc. Then, businesses will obviously outsource. I agree with your next statement. 

5. Yes. Also, true, but it also causes a huge economic declines in the Rust Belt of America.

6. Most manufacturing jobs were already unionized and were middle class jobs in the 20th century. In order for the workers to compete, they would have to reduce their wages and cut benefits, which in turn made them lower class. Some had to leave to retail jobs, which have less pay than their manufacturing jobs.  




 Yes. That is also true for some, but they don't have the enough political power to discriminate the majority or others like many conservative politicians throughout America. There are tons of examples. 




 The effective tax rate would still be higher than today's effective tax rate. If the marginal income tax today is 30%-ish, Why do we still have debates on loopholes? Nobody pays 30%. Many pay less than 30% and sometimes have a negative tax rate. With a high marginal tax rate of 90%, Wouldn't you expect an effective tax rate higher than today's effective tax rate? 




 Ya. They try to get party unity on votes.  




 True. Not all republicans are racist, but you can not deny that the Solid South excluding cities and minority areas are all Republican dominated now. Also, the Solid South is known for having some social groups based on hating minorities in the past and today-ish. Those groups wouldn't necessarily vote Democrat in today's politics.  




 A whip is basically a party's main person to gather/rally members to support/vote/agree on the majority of the party's views on a issue.

 I know the Diamond Political spectrum. There is one created by Libertarians themselves.

Ron Paul is definitely more economically conservative than Hillary and Obama. 

"Clinton and Obama mass-murdered and tortured people. " Source? 




 How about John Tower (R) Senator from Texas, who voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1964?

Why do Republicans cite Byrd to claim that Democrats = racist when obviously when 99%+ of all southern Republicans and southern Democrats opposed Civil Rights? 









 Ron Paul is more rightwing than Obama and Clinton on economic issues. He is only left of them on social issues in some cases and on some Constitutional practices.  




 George HW Bush, Al Gore, and Clinton promoted that NAFTA will reduce illegal immigration, export more goods to Mexico, and create more "jobs". 

Today: Illegal Immigration increased. Trade Deficit with Mexico Increased. Many Manufacturing Jobs left America.  




 The Parties are different. it is just that both are influenced by some similar sources. To change, you either vote lesser or two evils, primary the establishment, or vote 3rd party - (not the best option on change depending on the outcomes) 




 I don't think it is much. The stimulus only provided only around 50 billion dollars to 75 billion dollars on infrastructure.
 
American Society of Civil Engineers states that the government needs to spend 3+ trillion dollars to fix every problem, but we know that is not achievable.  




 the word Chiefs isn't really "native american" per say fully. You can have a "chiefs" name and random logo of a strong figurative leader. I do agree that MLS should stay away from logos that are Native American based.

 Not necessarily. Spending on Public Works Projects boosts demand for Manufacturing Products and American resources such as Steel. Those projects provide medium term union construction jobs because repairs take longer than building pipelines. Also, those resource demand can build public transit/repair highways/introduce competition to the very profitable airlines via rail transit, which will increase mobility and boost efficiency in travel.

 "compassionate conservative might see the social problems of the United States, such as health care or immigration, as issues that are better solved through cooperation with private companies, charities and religious institutions rather than directly through government departments." - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compassionate_conservatism

You are using a hard-core definition of what it means for a conservative to be a RINO. George Bush was Neo-Con as well. Patriot Act, Illegal Spying, Tripling the Deficit, etc came with the need to fight wars in Afghanistan and the fear of WMDs in Iraq. Cutting Taxes is also a conservative position, which reduced expected increases in revenues, which in combination with military spending, created more deficits. We do not have Open Borders with Mexico. We do have one with Canada. "Big Government" was the result of increased military spending and general increases in revenue/spending based on population growth. 

George Bush is still an establishment conservative, but more moderate leaning on some issues than the typical modern conservative. As evident in this link:

http://www.ontheissues.org/George_W__Bush.htm 




 I agree. I wish more politicians would address the issue of rail transportation. We haven't heard much since 2010's Obama/Biden's HSR proposal.  




 Bush isn't a progressive. Bush was a compassionate conservative. "compassionate" is another meaning for moderate without being labeled as a "leftwing progressive" or "RINO" or "socialist" and still be considered a normal conservative.  




 Just a thought. America funds a lot for airports and highways/roads/cars for domestic transportation. Why is Amtrak still behind in competitiveness? 




 I think MLS needs more color diversity.

Green, Orange, Purple, Yellow, Brown needs to be better represented.  




 Not even. Jeb Bush is a populist leaning conservative on most issues. 

http://www.ontheissues.org/Jeb_Bush.htm

He is still at best 90% the same as an establishment conservative. 




 It is worth to have a discussion because economic policy is always debateable. After all, since free-trade is so beneficial, Shouldn't America negotiate more free-trade agreements with India, African Union, more South American Countries, Russia, Iran, Iraq, etc? Every country has a comparative advantage is something, right? 




 I think people have the wrong definition of populism.

Populists are people, who are economically liberal and socially conservative. 

Progressives/Liberal are people, who are economically liberal and socially liberal.

Note: There were Progressive Republicans in the early 20th century to mid 20th century. 




 "a course in economics" meaning that I taken basic microeconomics and macroeconomic courses. As you can see my link in one of my comments, I can understand that gains from trade graph. Of course, there are many other factors when countries trade for goods. Also, I could be proven wrong by people, who study more economics than me.  




 um... This trade process has been occurring since forever. Many products move from country to country.  




 It is on WikiLeaks 




 Ya. Of Course, In any economics textbook, Comparative Advantage of Trading benefits both countries. Though, I wonder what area Americans are specializing in. Probably, High-Tech and Science, but ya.  




 I agree. Gore, Clinton, and HW Bush pushed the idea that NAFTA will create more jobs, end illegal immigration, increase American exports. These are lies. The American Trade Deficit increased with Mexico. illegal Immigration increased. Manufacturing Jobs declined throughout the 90s.  I know where these Pro-Free experts get their evidence from. It appears in any economics textbook with this simple graph. Of course, the majority of economists are pro-trade. Some are pro-protectionism.

Example: http://welkerswikinomics.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/gains-from-trade_2.jpeg
 




 It is simple Supply and Demand Graph. It can applied for any business market. 




 I agree. I tend to not agree with those textbooks data and evidence, but a lot of economists would say that Pro-Free Trade = Good 




 I have taken a course in economics. American Produces lose some Producer Surplus because they can't compete with low prices of the world market. American Consumers gain Consumer Surplus because they can get cheaper goods. The producer surplus loss and the consumer surplus gain is basically a transfer of surplus within the original economy. The consumers, who can access cheaper goods below equilibrium now from trade, adds to the consumer surplus. It is shown by the triangle in the graph.

http://welkerswikinomics.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/gains-from-trade_2.jpeg

Of course, I think those economics textbooks promote that free-trade "can" improve surpluses/welfare/etc

They cite tariffs as causing more dead-weight losses and hinder ability to a competitive free-trade market. 




 Supposedly in economics, if the World Production Costs and Price of goods are lower than America's production and product prices, then free-trade actually benefits the consumers of America through trade. Consumers could expand overall surplus. The American producers are the ones, who will suffer.

Example: http://welkerswikinomics.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/gains-from-trade_2.jpeg

 I recently got out of my budget crisis/recession. I borrowed a lot for economic growth earlier in the game 10 times of $200,000. In the crisis, I tried to cut services and raise taxes. Basically, I used 20% on everything except for low income residential, low income business, and high tech. For spending, I cut education, police, healthcare, parks, and roads. I maintained power, fire, water, trash, and public transit.  I used a lot of "weaknesspays" to maintain surpluses, if I went into the negative range. Now, I got out of the big time crash with some BIG time business boom, since I had 90,000+ people before and after this mess.

I want to know your plan of action. How do you survive your crisis?

 Keep the Shift. Strategy makes the game interesting because the defense is not stagnant in the same positions. 

If MLB wanted more runs and offense, Put the DH in the National League. An average MLB pitcher is almost 85%+ a guaranteed out. They are worse than the worst actual batter in any lineup.

If you want drastic changes to rules to boost offense, How about don't count all fouls as strikes? Why 2 strikes and a foul = nothing happens, yet first 2 fouls = strikes? Why not have all fouls = strikes to speed up the game?

 Not really. Perot's voters were anti-establishment, anti-free-trade, moderate on some issues, anti-2 party system, and swing left and right on random issues. His supporters were from Clinton's Populist Labor Faction that includes Labor Unions, who were against New Democrats (Blue Dogs) and Bush's moderate Anti-Reaganonomics + RINOs + some Far-Right Conservatives (Who liked some Perot's Nationalistic Policies).  




 If he runs as an Independent, I will vote most likely support the Democrat because the consequences of a Republican President from a split leftwing vote is bad for the Supreme Court, Gerrymandering, Foreign Policy, Agenda setting, and Exectutive Orders.

 Absolutely, I agree. Draft Picks for the worst teams rewards failure. Also, NFL is also a communist/socialist centralized sports league that shares profits/revenues evenly for each sports team. Also, the Union Ownerhsip of the Green Bay Packers is bad for business.  




 You will see more offense, which means that good defenders now will rise in value because there are so few of them in MLS.  




 I don't understand why Toronto is picking Altidore over Gilberto.  




 The players threathen strike, but they know that a strike will tremendously affect the whole league in a negative way.

The league does need to reform its parity, rules, free agency, and money. If the league takes a loss this year, projected growth says that the league will continue to grow, so taking debt now, won't necessarily impact the league finances in the long-term.

Orlando City SC should just be Orlando City Lions SC.  




 Forwards: Dom Dwyer, Robbie Keane, Gilberto

Right Wing: Finlay, Nagbe, Neagle

Left Wing: Davis, Zusi, Pappa, 

Attacing Midfield: Barnes, Feilhaber, Valeri

Defending Midfield: Alonso, Juninho, Kitchen

Defenders: Hedges, Gonzalez, Horst

Defensive Wingers: Franklin, Beasley, Beitashour

Goalkeeper: Hamid, MacMath, Ousted
 




 I think Montreal's defense will be good this season.  




 Atlanta Firebirds is the best name.  




 LOL. If you want a Communist Sports League, Look at the NFL. 




 By the way, The Interstate Highway System would cost 1 trillion dollars in today's money currency value.  




 As shown, Obama clearly stated that he wants to sign the TPP on the State of the Union. 














 commercial sells the stuff produced by industry. Industry creates goods from resources. Residential demands goods and money from jobs to buy. 




 just wondering... Will Yugo's speed roids be released in Crossover Souls? 




 Does Gilberto come since toronto can't have 4 dps? 




 Doesn't Toronto have more than 3 DPs? If so, then one player has to be traded before beginning of the season. 




 THIS A F-ING HUGE!!!! Congrats! 

Toronto will be a other fav teams this year other than the Revs, but Revs still #1 




 it is a good location but it might interfere with rail and subway congestion in the future, if rail travel were to increase. The area basically look like a giant industrial box with parking spaces and rail tracks. It is close to city and it is somewhat near the MBTA, so the area has many pluses. 




 It is a real possibility. The London Olympics had a full development of the area and the stadium was given for West Ham to use. if Boston wanted to repay the cost of the Olympics, they could charge a small tax on sporting events. Of course, there are other ways to fund it. 




 Other MLS teams should really consider these 2 players 




 Strange... When I first clicked on it, it was open.... 














 We don't need more (Fill in Name City) FCs or SCs in MLS. . 




 Wooh....Mark Bloom :O  




 Don't forget Vladimir Putin, but Russia did sent a delegation there.  




 While I support rail, more energy production, and more environmental regulations, I can see why Keystone can benefit us. I don't necessarily mind if Obama vetos or signs it. Though, I would prefer that Obama sign it. 




 Good Points. Though, I am just promoting an alternative view on the Keystone Pipeline that is different from other people.  




 I think that is the best approach. Keystone is worth conceding on. TPP isn't worth for Obama to compromise with Republicans on.  




 you should for fantasy. it is easier to follow than other sports. 




 J Jones should have went to Chicago Fire in a competitive point of view. 




 But... the International Space Station is one step to New World Order. Aren't Conservatives enraged?  




 True. I just don't want Obama to be labeled as "anti-energy" when he clearly isn't. Also, signing Keystone prevents Conservatives from blaming him for rising gas prices, if they were to rise. Also, I don't think many rural conservative voters understand the hazards of the Pipeline. I say let them deal with environmental hazards, if they leak. Though....Congress could just sign Keystone by bypassing Obama's veto and take all the blame, if environmental damages were to occur.  




 Does property values affect the buildings? if so, I will destory. :o 




 At the moment, my "central" city has tons of tall buildings. Are you suggesting zoning low density around it?  




 Ya. Though, for American Football, you can place a stadium anywhere and people will still go because it is only a weekly event. Plus, it is very inelastic in demand and supply due to low amount of games for millions of fans with limited seats.  




 Will the Olympic Stadium Proposal be in South Boston area? 

Many people are concerned about the cost of the Olympics in 2024. If the Revolution were to use the stadium, Would a small tax % added to the price of the seats there be used to repay the cost of the stadium? Is the Olympic Stadium entirely privately funded?  




 Wow.... Isn't that communist? :) 




 Agreed. I lean yes on the Olympics because it provides short-term business boost and global marketing of Boston. It could also help to boost infrastructure. However, I wished the city had a vote though.  




 Baker won because Falchuk got a lot of moderate liberal supporters. 

Falcuk's 3.3% of the voters would have gone to Coakley, if he weren't in the race. 

Though, it would still be even, if Lively weren't in the race. His supporters would have gone to Baker.  




 Good News to hear :) 




 My central city used to be mostly $$, $$$, and some $ people with manufacturing, high-tech, and $$ and $$$ businesses. It had good schools and good health services. I have neighboring cities with 100% $ people, $ business, and dirty. Then suddenly, $ people started rising and a lot of $$ and $$$ businesses +apartments started to decay or abandon. Jobs weren't demanded. Commute Time increasing. Budget was in free-fall....

To combat this:

1. I did readjust taxes in all my neighboring cities with 20% taxes on everything except dirty to encourage them to move to my major city. 

2. My city was in financial disaster. Budget Deficits and Low Cash. I decreased all residential taxes down to 4% to encourage people to come. Increased the Commercial and Industrial Taxes to around 11%. Slashed funding to health, police, ordinances. Ran on a surplus for some months. Slowly restored police and health funding. Took out 2 loans to get me to $500,000 in cash and roughly 1k to 2k budget deficit.

Now, my finances are in order mostly with positive demand for $ and $$ residential, but how I do actually grow and increase demand for industry and commercial? Any tips?  




 Resort with $$$ residential with lighthouse  




 Who will be those 4 Democratic Senators?

Though, I want Obama to sign Keystone, even though I am pretty liberal on environmental issues. 

Obama has other issues to draw lines before the 2016 election like Trade, Budgets, Taxation, etc. Making an environmental line on energy, when energy production has been increasing under Obama's administration isn't a good strategy for Democrats. 




 Perot would be rated as a moderate liberal today by Ontheissues.org 




 Actually, most pro-freetrade politicians have entered the Republican Party now, since most Third Way Democrats are voted out of office.  




 Yes, I agree. You don't want to build a small stadium of 20k seats too early with no expansion room with demand ever increasing. Then, you would have to build a 40k stadium in the future again. 




 Actually, HW Bush negotiated NAFTA. Clinton ran on it in the 1992 presidential campaign with most Republican Congress in support with around 40% of Congressional Democrats.  




 Seattle does the coverups as well in their giant stadium. I don't think it is matter of how the stadium looks, but rather how passionate the fanbase is... 




 Low Cost of Living. Republicans tend to cite "Low Cost of Living" of good economic indicators. 

Mississippi has a low cost of living as well.  




 It is more of automation and outsourcing that caused the decline. Unless you want Detroit and Rust Belt America to have a Race to the Bottom to outcompete, those declines are the consequences of free-trade deals.  




 Conservative Republicans will tell you that Democrat areas are the blame. However, Mississippi is almost a one party supermajority state legislature. All they need is some conservative Democrat Senators to swing votes.  




 Seriously. Jeb Bush is no moderate. he is just as conservative as anybody in the GOP but he is just more left than the rest on some issues such as immigration and education. Today's GOP is all about a purity test of conservatism. 




 They have themselves to blame. I am a millennial and I just voted in the previous election. it was my first election. 




 Atlanta (MLS) team is doing the stadium cover-up. If Atlanta succeeds in doing so, then the Revs can follow by covering up seats in a 60k seat stadium.  




 West Ham in the EPL is renovating London's Olympic stadium by adding seats to cover the track field.  




 in a decade, the revs can support 30k to 40k fans in the stadium, if MLS attendance continues to grow. if they can't, the revs can cover up seats in the new stadium. 




 We should have another NAFTA like debate. 




 I am glad infrastructure is the #1 priority 




 Just leave it as New Jersey MetroStars for the mean time. Then, they can change to New York MetroStars in the future? Buy New York Cosmos name?  




 True, which is why Public Transportation is more of an Urban and Inner-Belt Suburban areas. It is just unreasonable for people outside congested and density populated areas.

Based on total population, if everybody in urban + suburban voted based on more public transit in their areas (assuming everybody voted in the best interest of more public transit), more public transit would always win.  




 Yes. Many politicians do that as well, if they know how to do it effectively. Also, it depends on how motivated you are. - How you value Keystone against winning politically?

Example:

Notice how Republicans have "evolved" on gay marriage issues. Sometimes, they say for it, but at times against.  




 Um... That is because the basic capitalist system needs a lot of workers compared to few top management workers of a business. Everybody has to get to work. Poor People going to work is no different than how everybody else going to work. 

It isn't really regressive. Also, you do have options of public transit, which if you live near public transit, you could save money.

 
























 Drop either Nemeth, Ponitus, or Diaz. 




 Gerrad. Keane and Zardes can score from Gerrad's services more than Nemec and Villa from Lampard's services. 




 Soumare is better than Ciman cost wise. Soumare was one of the best point scorers on the Chicago Fire last year.  




 Yes. It is a factor, but it isn't a major factor of a "terrible economy". "terrible economy" has many many factors.  




 Because people use the "low participation rate" to justify that the economy is poor. You get that a lot from conservatives. It is one of the lingering factors of the recession as well as the aging American population, slower and slower recoveries, etc. Back in the 1950s, less than 60% of Americans were particapating in the labor force, yet the economy was still prosperous mostly due to fact that we won the war, but still.  




 That is such a bad way of thinking for maintaining and functioning a society.  




 The labor participation rate fell during the bush he's years as well. So bush's economy was also in crisis?  




 New England has a lot of Liverpool FC fans so..... 




 I mean... If the laws are bad after they are implemented, you vote politicians out or propose new ones. 




 Lol that sounds like an ad made by Tom Cotton on Obama adding food stamps to farm bills.  




 Hence why some oppose reforming the electoral college to majority rules or a proportional system. I wish we had a more proportional system. 




 It doesn't matter because Obama's presidency has been effective at getting us out of the recession. The GOP will probably rewrite history by claiming that doing nothing and mass control of local and state governments helped improve the economy instead of the federal government. 




 Actually if you talk to republicans, they say that doing nothing is good because it means no bad laws will be passed through Congress.  




 Yugo is by far the most intriguing and weird character so far. 




 Does anybody know if speedroids will be introduced into the game and which set? 




 Max Urruti was my fav for this season during the pre-season, since he trailed BWP in goals per 90 minutes last season, but he is on the bench. 

If I had to list potential candidates, it would be:

Blas Perez, Urruti, Altidore, and Rivero at the moment. Still too early in the season to call.

 




 any deck that can nuke the field is good in this format.  




 I know. people used to use Spell Canceller to side against Nekroz just a few weeks ago. lol 




 BATTERYMANS! 




 Really? I think Arc-V's story, plot, theme song, background music, presentation, and acting is better than Zexal's and 5d's.  




 Karakuri Watchdog mdl 313 "Saizan"? 









 Casual but I go to locals to see what the status and variety of yugioh community. I just can't play yugioh casually with friends or neighborhood people anymore because they either quit, don't have time, have other priorities, etc. 




 Any more? :| 




 Twister, Storm, Tornado, Wild Tornado, Artifact Ignition, Bait Doll, Night Beam, etc

Any more of those? 




 Yes, if MLS wanted to go over 32 team limit. They would have to create 2 leagues of 20 teams for a total of 40 teams.

 




 Don't transfer all 2 players for week 2 because Week 1 is usually random. I'll wait until week 2 to make a decision on what players need to be transfered out. Plus, you can have 3 transfers to mold your team in the future week.  




 I have feeling Royal Magical Library will soon be on the Ban List...soon... 




 Patroid - Look at 1 set card in the spell or trap zone that your opponent controls 




 Thanks! 




 Does Green mean favorable and Red mean unfavorable?  




 Dempsey 60%, but you can always go with Altidore 40% chance, since the few games of any season are unexpected.  




 He wasn't that great last season too. He is fast and all. I was hoping that he would at least grab an assist in Game 1 since Vancouver does have speedy forwards. He only got 1 point, which was the worst of my team's preformance, so I had to make a cut.  




 Yugo because he is so random. Declan is myserious but considered an anti-hero.  




 If Konami errated Vehicroid Connection Zone to "roid" type macine monsters, then Roids as an archtype would be good.  




 Roids.  




 I just transfered one player because 1st days are always unexpected. Eric Hurtado for Jose Villareal with some spare millions.  I just hope the ones that I got before Week 1 actually perform in Week 2. Otherwise, I will have 3 transfers to build up. 




 roids! 




 Att and Defense Combinations.

The attack points or defense points of 2 or more monsters must equal to a #. The combination of monsters will be sent to the banish instead of the graveyard. The new extra monsters' Attack and Defense are not considered attack and defense points but rather something else? When those monsters attack, they are not treated as attacking, but you can only attack once per a turn? 




 I think America needs to have a more transit oriented culture and infrastructure in order for public transit to be "privatized". 




 They are somewhat by releasing new support for archtypes.  




 True to a certain extent, but there is a point where Globalization inherently eliminates national soverignty and national cultures. 




 It is concerning but it is less concerning than the TPP.  




 ^ Basically 




 Sorry for the wrong usage of the word. Games with no significant influence on playoffs are just money makers.  




 New Ban Lists are now 1/4 of the year.  




 Konami wants Pendulum decks to dominate to market ARC-V.... so... not really.  




 Konami will not hit Qlis because Qlis are a good pendulum deck to market ARC-V. They might hit Rituals and Nekroz support a bit because they need more balance in the game. Though, I wouldn't count on that since the TCG just released support and don't want to lose $$$.

Konami will hit Dante, Burning Abyss support, and maybe Shadolls, so they can add a new archtype into the meta for tier 1.  




 not really. America will get jobs outsourced from Europe since European rules and regulations are stricter than American rules and regulations. TTIP is more of a concern for the EU. 




 I consider myself a Rockefeller Republican or a Populist Democrat, so it is hilarious to see GOP call out each other as RINOs. Democrats don't call out DINOs as much as Republicans do, but oh well. I wished we had more political parties though.  




 I love how Republicans call out moderates as "RINOs". Please continue :) 




 More meaningless games is just more revenues for the business of the teams.  




 Ya because 9 strikes to a strikeout was so traditional back in the 19th century. Baseball is not what used to be. 




 Also new rule changes have always occurred in baseball. 




 how will you balance the game so it is more fair but still favor new archtypes? 




 we have a 2 party system with representatives and senators. Germany has a multiparty system with a parliament like system. 




 torrential Tribute 




 Hyperspeedroid Dahma 




 do you live in a rural farm area in the middle of America? o.O 




 That could work, but that plan must be aided by an increase in the gas tax. I doubt people will want to take the MBTA over the car via the Masspike. An expansion like that will cause no significant increase in ridership because of various opportunity costs. The elasticity of car usage of people outside of Boston and ring highways is greater than the elasticity of public transit usage of city people within Boston. 




 The real solution is building safer pipelines, regulating oil trains properly, and decrease dependence on fossil fuels. 




 keystone will help to reduce some demand off of oil trains but companies will still need oil trains to ship oil for medium distances from oil pipelines. 




 pipelines are only a short term solution and they still have faults. they still leak and companies still need to ship oil via rail in medium distances from the pipelines. What needs to be done is build more pipelines, improve rail safety, pipeline regulation, and decrease dependence on fossil fuels. 




 Some people outside of MBTA service areas say that they don't want to pay for the MBTA's upgrades, expansions, etc because Why should they pay for something that they don't use?  




 I applaud MLB for decent changes for pace. 




 Not really. They are so expensive for the booster boxes. 




 Magician's Force of you can get it at a good value. 




 There are half spell and half monster cards. They are treated as spells in the pendulum zones and monsters in the monster zones. Each zone has a different effect for it. They have scales between 1 and 12. You can pendulum summon monsters with levels in between the the numbers of the scales. When pend monsters/spells are destoryed, they go to extra deck. You can pend summon again from extra deck.  




 I think Pendulums will help vanilla monsters out in yugioh. 




 I think that the people, who left Yugioh because of Pendulum Summoning, should just watch the anime. It is literally very dramatic and can easily top as one of the best Yugioh Series. 

" I love the ever growing game bit many old players just dont want to accept it. " - People said this for Fusion Summoing, Synchro Summoning, and XYZ Summoning.  




 I don't recommend Zexal. It is easily one of the worst Yugioh series.  




 I recommend 5Ds because the style of yugioh is similar to the current metagame. Also, the images are better than GX and the Original. The 5D's rock song is similar to GX's theme song. GX and Original Yugioh are also a good series to watch. I don't recommend Zexal, if you just got back. The presentation of Zexal is not great.  




 True. Sacramento Republic could relocate to San Francisco in the future, if they wanted to.  




 if you have access to public transit, then it does discourage driving. Otherwise, it is very inelastic for people, who don't have access. 




 If San Fran were to get a team, it would another in the bay area. California could realistically see 6 MLS teams.... but..... who knows... 




 Boston University here. Close enough lol 




 Boston University!! Anybody plays?  




 Actually, if you rank cities based on population of metro areas, Sacramento is 28th compared to San Diego which is 17th. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_American_and_Canadian_cities_by_number_of_major_professional_sports_franchises 




 A Sacramento MLS expansion would essentially prevent San Diego from getting an MLS team. I don't think MLS will have 2 LA teams, 2 SF Bay teams, 1 in Sacramento, and 1 in San Diego for a total of 6 teams of 1/5 of a 30 team league. 

 




 The 2 party system is terrible 




 Thanks! Ultra-Pros do load from the sides.  




 Are the Ultra-Pro 9 pocket sheets good for storage? The cards do have to enter from the sides. Does that effect how I need to handle the binder, if they fall out?

or 

Are the BCW 9 pocket sheets a better alternative because they store cards from the top rather than from the sides?

Thanks for the help. 




 A higher gas tax would have to be placed so the MBTA would get the riders that it needs 




 You can be a libertarian and still have moderate views. Nothing wrong, though transit can be public-private partnership at times. 




 Just keep in mind. A lot of conservatives, centre-right people, and Tea Party folks in Massachusetts have been calling for privatization and waste cutting during this snow crisis to fund the MBTA.  




 Recently, the T has had a lot of infrastructure problems from the storm, which caused a lot of people to complain about it. However, the real problem is a money and the lack of investment in the system for years. Would Privatizing it help? Should the T get more funding? Should the T cut waste? What should be done?  




 Baseball has more data and more variance spread out through more games to accurately measure than football, so baseball relatively easier to predict than football. 




 Ross Perot's voters were from both Republicans and Democrats. 

Perot's voters were anti-Reaganomics Conservatives, Rockefeller Republicans, Isolationist and Labor Democrats. 




 We need a proportional system for votes. 




 D: I am sad that Speedroids didn't come out in this set. At least we do get Clear Wing Synchro Dragon and other machine support of cybers. 




 Decoyroid, Ambulanceroid, Rescueroid, Cyber Summon Blaster OTK? 




 If you want to boost your skill level, you should help other players improve their game.  




 There are more spells and traps than monsters. 




 Get the Box early, if you know that you really want the cards for the archtype. Do note that after supply increases, the prices of single cards will drop until the demand, which is the metagame, favors Nekroz. Then, prices will start to increase faster than supply. If not, the prices will fall to its minimum.  




 Prices only drop in the beginning because the supply increased. The market doesn't know if the deck is competitive or not. However, if the deck does in fact do well, Demand will rise faster than Supply, so they get more expensive. 




 Box because there is a limited supply in the beginning, so singles will be expensive. Box allows you to get more of them for a better value.  




 Honestly, they will be on here just to look around, if they are bored or want to know what the fans are doing......
 




 Hello! I am just wondering because I have collected a lot of yugioh since the orginal yugioh. I have a lot of commons, a decent amount of rares, and some really good and/or staple cards. I might trade or sell some cards away to make some few dollars. 

What are some good binders to get based on value relative to price?  




 HAHA! I honestly hope they include Hungry Burger into that mix. 




 LOL. I wish yugioh made a food yugioh deck. remember the food monsters from GX and Arc-V? 




 Just joking lol 




 It is cheaper to buy the box, when the set intially comes out because you get more cards for the Nekroz deck and/or for other decks. Also, since there is a limited supply, when it comes out, the singles will cost abe worth a lot. Don't buy singles, when it intially comes out because the prices will decrease as the supply increases. Buy singles, if you know that market has hit its minimum value. Over time, if that particular deck does well against other decks, demand will rise faster than supply, which cause Singles to be high in value again. If that is the case, just the buy box. 




 Roids :) 




 Congrats!! 




 Exodia 




 You will make a profit, if you resell. :) 




 Well in Georgia, highways can have 8 lines of traffic on both sides. Lol 




 I feel like decks will have different varieties of spell/trap removal. This card works best in mill decks. 
























 If they are in welfare, how can they afford to travel to California? 




 only Europe should be concerned of TTIP because America is their "developing" country for them. 




 Remember the Fox News welfare guy buying lobsters? he doesn't look obese at all. lol
 




 it just to do with the fact that our league doesn't have the finishing nor the midfield to allow our forwards to score. Though it is early in the season, so I expect scoring to pick up soon. 




 I am not a big fan of 0-0 draws or low scoring games to be honest. 




 I chose Harrington because he is a safe starter. $5 million less.  




 Michael Harrington 




 Use the Wildcard. You didn't plan it out, right beforehand. 




 it is not a problem. We just don't a system to encourage more diversity. if families of people wan to run for president go ahead, the candidates will be judged the fact that it is a family legacy. 




 omg... I go to Pandemonium was well. The one you are talking about is in Boston, right? 




 Kah might not start so I recommend  getting somebody that is more certain. 




 I wouldn't say Colorado's defense is weak. They are just heavily reliant on O'Neill and Moor to be healthy with Irwin in goal. 




 I used all my free transfers. I don't want to take  a -4 on a defender and maybe only get 2 points if no clean sheet. 




 Jack Jewsbury. He is listed as a defender, but he is playing more of a defensive midfielder role.  




 I think LA will probably get some goals on Vancouver this week. I think getting VAN defenders on the DGW is the better alternative. Kah vs Adekugbe is a tossup and uncertain.  




 I have Jewsbury, Ramos, and Opara as my defenders for this week. 
I have Neagle in midfield against Deric., but Martins and Dempsey are injuried. I have Arrieta in forward, yet facing Ramos. I don't have any Philly players on my team, so I am leaning on Marin for this week, but I do have Opara....so....Any thoughts?

 




 Designated Hitter in the National League or Having only a 8 man lineup is the easiest solution. Also, it would uniform the whole league in its rules. 

You could also wait decades to fix the low offense game, but every sport has made changes to its rules since its inception. Baseball rules have been altered throughout history. The game of the 1890s and 1920s is different from today's. What is interesting is that we had more offense and shorter games decades ago. 

There are other methods that would be more drastic:

Changing the Baseball's Matter, Alter the Bat's matter, Bring the Fences in, Treat all Fouls as nothing against the batter, Lower the Pitcher's Mound, 
 




 barbaroid the ultimate battle machine? 




 Burch wasn't a starter last year. After he filled in for Colorado with Moor and O'Neill out in injury, Colorado win/loss record went on a downwards spiral. I wouldn't get Burch since Colorado has done better this year with clean sheets with O'Neill on the team and without Burch, which is typical of Colorado. 




 Just watch yugioh Arc-v dub, if you want to see them in action.

Youtubers such as Cyberknight8610 and Azneyeswhitedragon have a lot of helpful yugioh videos as well. You can also find other youtubers as well. 




 We need a proportional multiparty system. Anything that has to do with districts will be gerrymandered.  




 There needs to be major infrastructure investment. 




 one way streets are very efficient since you don't spend so much time waiting at traffic lights. Also pedestrians and bikers benefit since they know the street only goes one way. 




 Dom Dwyer 




 All my spell cards turned into magic cards... 




 I would rather see how many Americans would support the Tea Party, Greens, Libertarians, and Socialists as parties  




 Also you got to remember that land is finite on the macro level so you need to increase housing for more people at the same time you have to increase land for farming. 




 It discourages density and creates sprawl, which has some major impacts environmentally. 




 I think this is a great add by Montreal, if this is true. 




 Dang... All my Spell cards turned into Magic cards today :\ 




 Honestly if you looked in Gallup polling on how Democrats Identified themselves in 1980s to 2008. You would notice that a lot of them were considered New Democrats and considered themselves "moderates" at the time. 




 Hence there should a multiparty system to show what Americans really believe in. 




 Don't get Altidore because he has no game the next week.  




 If so, then all countries should abolish borders, trade barriers, and end immigration restrictions.  




 YES! ROIDS! 




 West Ham United is renovating the London 2012 Olympic Stadium to fit in soccer. Also, the land used for the Olympics there is redeveloped for housing, science, schools, etc.  




 How is the Olympic Bid bad for the Revs? A Giant Stadium with tarp is better than a small stadium. Also, it removes any possibility that the Revs will need to relocate out of the small stadium for a bigger stadium.  




 Will the Revs stadium be part of the larger Boston 2024 plans?  




 Batteryman. Easy to OTK lol 




 I repied to a comment, which implied Democrats = Big Business, Income Inequality, Corruption, etc 




 So Democrats are now the party of business? I thought the Democrats stifled business growth.  




 I really regret transferring out Palmer for Sjoberg yesterday. I do have Peay if he plays :/ 




 better than nothing. after all. If they were to provide the exact # of days with free-service, then would lose double the amount of expected revenues for this year.  




 I like Canada's three to 5 party more so than US's system . It is very interesting how the stats reflect that divide.  




 You would still want a mix of residental, commerical, and industry in each city. Just varying amounts of sizes. 

If one city falters, then your other city would be crisis mode to import all those dirty industrial jobs back.  




 It isn't Post-Hoc Fallacy. This logic would also apply to debunk any Tax Cuts boosting jobs, Reagan's deflation/taxcuts boosting the economy, Republicans claiming Bush's economic growth is better than Clinton's because he got us out of the Tech-Bubble, Stimulus creating jobs, any government cuts/spending creating jobs, etc.

Anything in the Marco-Level economics can happen, so justifying Post-Hoc is really missing the whole point of economics. It is all about correlation and sometimes causation, but it also up for the intrepretation of stats.  




 It is also one of things that Obama and Republicans actually agree on yet both claim that they don't agree on anything lol 




 Because the Bay Area is one of the largest metro areas in the US. They can support 2 teams. California could potentially have 6 MLS teams, if people, who say it should be based on metro areas instead of states, get their way.  




 Seitz because LA's attacking subs are quite good. 




 How about San Fran and San Diego?  




 Yes. 




 I am surprised since Konami would like to promote Pendulum Summoning..... 




 Artifact Batteryman with WattFox as synchro. It can stun, punish destruction, OTK, Rank 5, Rank 4, and swarm. 




 So Jewsbury will most likely be starting? o.O 




 Batteryman 




 So.... Will Peay or Jewsbury play? o.O 




 Transfer out kaka for a different player? 




 Of course, the money has to come from somewhere for the owners, who will need to pay for the intial costs of building the stadium and the investment/planning costs to build it.  




 You can't be assured that it will be voted down unanimously . Just a few months ago, 60% of Bostonians supported it. Now, it is down to 30% support. The decline was mostly due to the public transit problems during the snow storms. 




 Yet somehow, Atlanta gets a stadium that is "too big" for soccer. 




 Once you have the Olympics, there is already a stadium for usage. Then, the State House could have the Olympics tax on sporting events to pay for the cost overruns.  




 Then, the Boston area "soccer specific stadium" will probably be postponed to a later date or until Kraft has an incentitive to find land, stadium already in the plans, etc. Right now, Kraft has no major incentitive to find the Revolution a stadium.  




 True, though this method has been used by DC United for its stadium.  They used land formerly used by industry.  




 Bandwagoners only apply to people not within range of a team's city location. 




 The Olympics Stadium would be near the South End and South Boston area where they have railroad tracks, red-line tracks, industry, parking lots, storage, etc.  




 Bringing the Olympics will provide Kraft and the Revs with a stadium. Also, the Olympics will allow the redevelopment of an area that is primarily used for industry. 
 




 A few months ago, 60% were in favor, until the MBTA crisis, which caused the numbers to fall to 30% in favor. I am sure that many want to see redevelopment, after the Olympics are over. 




 If soccer fans in New England want a soccer-specific stadium in Boston, then they should vote yes on the Olympics Referendum, if there is one. Of course, you vote no on specifics like taxpayer funded cost overruns, but still.  




 The cosmos could merge with the New York Red Bulls. 




 I have Peay on Bench. Should I place him in starting lineup in place of Jewsbury or should I allow auto sub if Jewsbury doesn't play? 




 thanks. I guess I'll transfer out Bradley and keep Duka as a sub in case some other potential staters don't start. 




 Soumare wasn't able to play in the previous game. Lost Clean Sheet points. D: Duka is injured. I am more concerned with Duka....Will he play? 









 One of the best. Without question better than zexal and maybe 5ds in terms of presentation and drama. 




 Syrus Truesdale vs Yugo? roids vs speedroids? 




 When O'Neill comes back, will Sjoberg lose his spot since Colorado's defense functions better with O'Neill there? Harrington was in both games this season with clean sheets. Is Harrington a safer option? 




 So if I get him over Harrington, we will expect similar production and have a starting role? 




 jewsbury is midfielder but labeled as a defender. he is going to pick up some attacking bonus points if Rivero does score goals. 




 When O'Neill comes back, will Sjoberg lose his spot since Colorado's defense functions good with O'Neill there? Harrington was in both games this season with clean sheets. Is Harrington a safer option? 




 GX themes will enter.  




 Does everybody hate the xy dimension? lol. I think this is Konami's way of ridiculing us since Zexal was notoriously disliked by fans?  




 Will GX characters enter arc-v as well? 




 WHEN IS THE BANLIST COMING OUT? 




 Don't forget Mexico's economy and social standing has not improved with all the violence and drug cartels. Also, our trade deficit has increased with Mexico. 




 NAFTA also didn't reduce illegal immigration rates to the U.S. 




 Roids and Cloudians 




 Roids don't have steroids.  




 Sure. I don't understand why Conservatives recommend minorities to vote Republican especially in the South, where governments are already GOP dominated at the state level. Voting GOP, will only increase the GOP's control on legislation and court system.   




 Agreed, but there is a vocal wealthy minority that opposes this more proportional system ever since James Madison's Federalist Papers, which warned about a pure democracy voting away rights of white property owners. Honestly, I have yet to see a proportional democracies in developed voting away rights of "minorities" left and right without a legal system.  




 All developed countries have parties vs parties. It is natural part of human greed and governing.  




 But there is no incentitive for them to vote Democrat. Why would they? Like how there is no incentitive for black southerners to vote Republican there. 




 You need a proportional system first. Then, you can modify it. 




 ay ay captain 




 not exactly. You can have a leftwing and rightwing coalition. example: Greece and Germany 




 True, but he still didn't deliver on his promise of ending the Bush Tax Cuts. here, obama agrees with the GOP somewhat.  




 They should make a list, where you can have 4 copies of a card. lol 




 Also parliamentary debates are more entertaining than Congressional debates. 




 yep. I know. the third party spoiler effect. progressive Party, Greens, Reform Party, and Dixiecrats, etc each have spoiled the two major parties in our history. 




 if all black southerners voted republican, the south would be a one party region. think about that. 




 Yes. it will take amending the Constitution, but it should be a good thing. There is way too many Americans for just 2 major political parties. Also, we need to make sure that the greens, libertarians, centrists, socialists, and fringes of ideologies are heard to keep in check in the powers of the establishment. 




 A better solution is getting rid of the 2 party system, not proportional and sometimes anti-majority electoral college, gerrymandered house districts, and corrupt Senate. We need more parties and more proportion when we are voting. We are always one party away from a one party nation. In fact, many states are already almost one party controlled. 




 MULTIPARTY System USA! 




 We should be focusing on a proportional multiparty system with majority governs or coalition forming than mandatory voting. Also, eliminating gerrymandering by reforming how we elect our politicians should encourage more voters. Our electoral college, house districts, and proportion of Senators need to be reformed. 




 Not on the Trans Pacific Partnership, corporate tax reform, Bush Tax Cuts, Marijuana, NSA, etc 




 MTL has blostered their defense and New England hasn't done well for this season. Fagundez should be a no go. Shipp doesn't have the defense nor the forwards to get assists + bonus points.  




 Speedroids 




 We need a proportional system with majority wins. 




 Effective Tax Rates back in the 1950s would still be higher than today's 0% effective tax rates

 You can look in the conservative mindset and think "Why is this Kansas's Governor doing the thing for the benefit of conservatives?" and for what reason? 




 Just pretending to be a conservative 




 Thanks for the help! :D I didn't know how to do that as well. 




 I am assuming this will encourage people to attend private schools or get vouchers or go to charter schools to get "better" eduction, right? Also, it will prevent public unions from stealing taxpayer money? 




 Isn't this bribery?  




 I forgot to include imports of slave labor and natural resources, but mainly we produced our own texiles from cotton grown in the south and produced manufacturing up in the north.  




 You do realize the USA was a protectionist country up until WW2. The Republican Party used to support heavy tariffs and the Democratic Party used to support reduced tariffs. Our growth in capital resulted from the education system and innovation by Americans with some access to knowledge from European technology.  




 I think Konami might make that rule change sometime in the future to promote new dueling tactics. After all, GX characters followed that concept.  




 What are the economists thoughts on the trans pacific partnership? 




 Politics And ideologies can be ironic. Example: conservatives pro global trade yet nationalist. How? 




 System* 




 This is what happens with citizens United and a first past the post voting susten 




 Revenues naturally increase due to population growth. 




 Foreign Companies are growing the nations to serve their objective and sell them for the benefit of other countries. The goods produced aren't really used by the people in Africa themselves. They can use some of their wages to purchase some of the goods, but there isn't the full gains of trade. This method will take a long time for countries to actually develop into developed countries, but it still works. Hence, why the world's economy gets better each day throughout human history. It just depends on the rate of growth. 




 But... Protectionism is bad economic policy, right? According to simple economics, protectionism prevents competition, does not increase welfare, and doesn't improve the lives relative to when a country actually trades. 




 Roids 




 There is a video segment on Vice New's YouTube channel that looks into the pipeline industry's self regulation and the government's inability to regulate them. 




 Revenues will be increasing in the future due to the tax cuts ;)

Praise the Laffer Curve! 




 He isn't really overrated....

 You have 3 fusion sages and 3 poly? Fusion sage is basically an upstart..... 




 It is understandable from an economist point of view. Another interesting look is how free-trade functions between China and Hong Kong. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrkVDM5OYs4

There are similaritities between how they interact and how the US interacts with other countries. 




 I agree with the top point. Anything can cause a recession or depression, while policies are enacted in the extremes in a short period of time. 

For the second point, Are you suggesting that current path of America's trade policy should continue without any reforms or changes? 




 America built an economy up until World War 2 with heavy tariffs, growing unions, and lots of exports. 

You can argue on either end of the spectrum. It seems like the problem is the trade deficit. It is not protectionism vs free-trade. A little more protectionism could reduce the deficit and in return increase exports. 




 America was a protectionist country until World War 2. During that time, we built an incredible economy. Not saying alll free-trade and protectionism is bad, but some protectionism and some trade is good.  




 The whole irony is that while we debate whether burger flippers are worth $15, we seem to believe that manufacturing labor should be worth less than $1 because without it.....most of our goods would be more expensive.  




 Colorado's Defense does better when O'Neill and Moor are on the field. 




 Should people transfer out David Villa for BWP/Keane/Zardes/Wondolowski/Torres or Saborio in anticipation of round 8 and maybe round 9?  




 Ahh... the ignorant traditionalist Americans again... 




 Hm... I got Sam for this week..... but.... Should I also get Felipe? 




 I am glad that I captained Jacobson. lol 




 How exactly do we debunk the claims that free-trade always good for the economy from most economists?   




 roid cards if any :) 




 Oh the puns.... 




 There is some evidence, but it is still a theory. This is economics. You can't go far to extreme on either end. Also it is possible to shift demand and supply to get some outcomes. 




 A fully automated society will probably need basic income.  




 The minimum wage is still a price floor though. You could raise it to $15 min wage and reduce the labor supply and it wouldn't really create a lot of deadweight loss of the demand is inelastic. demand for labor is inelastic when businesses have to take the market wage and can't automate as quickly. 




 Small Businesses will probably take the new labor market wage because they can't buy capital initially because it would be too expensive to automate. 




 Raising the minimum wage still doesn't address the issue of why companies are making so much money off of an uncompetitive markets. they will continue outsourcing and automating these jobs. They will do in a faster rate if we do raise it now. 




 Anarchy! Because minorities should always rebel on majority rules. No. You face off in a court system. 




 Wouldn't it makes sense to reduce outsourcing incentivized first and increase competition in the markets so companies don't get as much profit to automate as quickly. Since we have an increase in small businesses, those businesses can't buy capital as fast as big businesses. Also a reduction in the labor supply by reducing the amount of new immigrant labor and an increase in unionization would push up wages as well. These should all go into effect before the min wage actually increases. 




 It will eventually balance out. Once western conference players hit the transfer market, they will most likely go to eastern conference. 




 if all nations abolished trade barriers, would all the world prices be at equilibrium? 




 When are we going to debate the merits of this on the media? 




 I would go with Kamara, since Agudelo could sometimes not start, since Charlie Davis is a good sub at the moment.  




 LOL It meant it has 2 letter ds 




 it is a sandwich  




 i can't make it pass the 5th episode but I you like yugioh a lot, it is a good extra series to watch. A bonus is hat the main character isn't dominant so it is unique in its own way. 




 yes. if you haven't watched it, it is one of the best. 




 I say yes, if you are getting rid of him long term.

 Not exactly. In Canada and UK, they have first past the post system with many parties. It is just that power is centralized to Parliament with proportion and majority rules that encourages more parties, but there is still the spoiler effect. 




 Mostly due to the fact that we allowed politicians to accept free-trade deals with countries not on similar living standards as us. 




 My defense is Hernandez (NYCFC), Harrington, and Ramos. Midfielders are Ishizaki, Sam, Jacobson, and Finlay. Forwards are Arrieta, Villa, and Rivero. I am leaning on Ousted because it wouldn't make sense to have Arrieta and Deric starting. 

Bench: Villarreal, Sjoberg 




 I say yes, if you have DGW players on your starting lineup. DGW players will probably make up the difference of -4. 




 Cardcar D 




 Nekroz is so weak. 




 Why would people captain defenders if one goal by the opposing team cause no clean sheets and defenders don't have manny opportunities to score goals? 




 Fluffals 




 Both have the same outcome, but I would say swinging strikes is better. Called strikes is basically a batter trying to get a ball or just confused by the pitch. swinging strikes are basically batter knowing where to hit but the pitch had some movement. Fouling balls for strikes is better than both.  




 Statistics are part of sports. All major sports teams use them. 




 Why do they have 2 performapals for vote? Are they trying to split the vote? DDD? The tcg has no support for it, so why do we need it? Beast eyes and Tiger are good for a vote.  




 Yugioh wouldn't be around much if people don't get access or have the chance to play decks. More competition = the better the community and support for the game as a whole. 




 The only viable way of using roids is mixing them with cybers, machinas, and rank 4s at the moment.  




 YES! ROID SUPPORT! 




 I would say that Montreal need a better goalkeeping than defenders. Though, the defense could be better. 




 Don't forget Shane O'Neill 




 That changes deck builds if people are unwilling to have 3 upstarts  




 Yet conservatives keep promoting that mass transit riders must pay more in fares to find the systems. 




 pot of greed 




 Imagine the traffic if all of those were shut down due to low funds. 




 Even small town USA needs the trains to deliver goods to other places and highways to get places. 




 Shouldn't John Boehner have found the money by now for transportation and the Highway Trust Fund? Reference: John Oliver :) 




 today's meta has so many cards on the field that I think mirror force outclasses dprison. 




 Why not? A strong military means a strong AMERICA!

 Since protection of national security is important, we should make it mandatory for all citizens to be in the army like how Switzerland does it. :) 




 Yes. By the way, I am left-leaning in politics.  




 Wouldn't the easiest solution be making college mandatory for all the citizens if it is so "important"? 




 if Rivero says he has some injury, then I guess morales. Though, morales could get some yellow or red card.... Ouch..... 




 I could try that because finlay might not start 2 games but it is worth the shot. 




 I wanted to transfer out Neagle because he price dropped by $0.1 and he hasn't produced as I wanted since the beginning of the season. Molino is also in the same category as Neagle. You recommend transferring in a good defender over a midfielder?  




 Starting:

Goalkeeper: Ousted

Defenders: Ramos(Orlando), Opara(SKC), Harrington (COL)

Midfielders: Ishizaki(LA), Jacobson(NYCFC), Neagle(SEA), Morales(VAN), Molino(Orlando)

Forwards:
Villa(NYCFC), Rivero(VAN)

Bench: Deric, Arrieta, Villarreal, Bedell, Peay, Robinson
 




 Driving in the United States has a very inelastic demand, so when prices increase by a certain %, the reduction in demand % falls less relative to the price % increase because most Americans live in areas without good public transit nor have jobs within walking distance. Hence, why people are so concerned when prices increase because it affects them a lot and can't change it. Some might get discouraged to drive as result of the gas prices increase. Those people will take public transit, which in turn increases ridership revenues via fares. Fare Increases in the MBTA to pay for the system itself would discourage and reduce ridership because city people can take taxis, walk to their jobs, carpool, buy a care, take UBER, etc. Most economists agree that raising the gas tax can be a very efficient policy.  

In Europe or other developed countries, Gas Prices are currently in many places 50% more or even double than our gas prices via very high gas taxes. Their roads and mass transit are better than ours.  




 He leans more socialist than the rest because he wants a single-payer healthcare system.  




 Steve Grossman was the best candidate. he isn't martha and he isn't too socialist like Berwick. 




 Remember the section on the gas tax. The easiest solution is raising the gas tax but people are against it in its full concept because they want really cheap gas prices. 




 Because Baker and the State House Would have cut even more spending without raising any taxes to balance the budget.  




 the repeal of the auto tax increase basically decreased the MBTA's expected future revenues by a few % points and some millions. 




 The easiest fix would be raising the gas tax. It will #1 fund road repairs and other infrastructure needs. #2 discourage excessive driving, so more riders will ride the T for more revenues.  




 I usually go on Saturdays. :) 




 Well, Steve Clark, Parkhurst, Pogatetz, Grana, and Finlay have played mroe than 200 minutes, so they are safe bets. If I had to chose a player, it would be Finlay because he has done well last season. You could do Steve Clark, but people are hoping on Vancouevr attack to do well, so it might backfire.  




 We need more political parties ranging from the fringes to the moderates to the libertarians to the populists.  




 Hitters have been taking drugs since the beginning of baseball.  




 Imagine Montreal vs Toronto or Boston or New York? 




 I recommend getting qliphorts sooner or later because the prices are falling and have the potential to rebound if the meta still allows them to function. 




 If they are working under the table for cash, then they are "working" techically to live a life instead of soly relying on welfare. Of course, these are Americans working under the table, yet somehow illegal immigrants can't work under the table for cash. 




 You do realize that strikeout rates have increased, game time length has increased, less homeruns, less hits, etc has been happening since the past 2 decades. We had more runs/homeruns/hits per game and shorter game length 2+ decades ago, so something needs to be addressed.  




 The easiest option is to buy players from teams with DGW. They will score more points than the average, so their price should rise. Then, you can resell them in the next round.  
























 I am unsure on who to start,Deric or Ousted.... :\
 




 Captaining BWP for the sake of it :) 









 It is not common in synchro dimension, but the tops and security probably has heard of it like how the top headquarters in every dimension knows about all the other summons.  




 Yes, but not every single one.  




 We should start tolling all highways, so it needs to run a profit.  




 No because only blue state urban folks use Amtrak. Why should rural red state people subsidize something that they don't use? We need to fund and build more highways and airports if we want to use money wisely. ;) 




 You sure these are the best evidence to be against TPP if freetrade has been proven by most economists to be a net benefit for everyone in the GDP sense. 




 Keane and Zardes aren't starting together at the top. Also Landon Donovan is gone, so it should have been expected from last season that LA doesn't have that assist maker threat.  




 Colorado's Postponed game . 




 Should workers be free to move from country to country to get better wages? 




 Economics has a lot of outside factors and can't really be scientific proven. 

Example: Nobody can scientific analyze to the exact point how a minimum wage increase can affect the economy.  




 In capitalism, yes.... it is inherently darwinistic.  




 Labor Particaption was also worse in the 1950s than today's.

One person can easily provide family income.  




 It similar to a budget deficit. We are consuming more than we can afford. 

Revenues = Trade Exports

Spending = Trade Imports

When we say we are exporting more through more jobs, we are increasing the rate of trade exports but ignoring how much trade imports we take in.  




 I agree. Trade is supposed to benefit all parties involved. Nobody should "lose" or have an "advantage". 




 Now, we have a time delay to get back to the original aggregate demand. 




 Those are small compared to the whole equilibrium market, so it doesn't affect equilibrium all that much. 




 So... We should continue on a negative trade balance? What are the benefits of a trade surplus, where we export more than we take in?

In economics, something has to add to zero because nothing is infinite.  




 Question: aren't the workers, who make the items are also a portion of demand, so if they lose their jobs, should demand of the good shift to the left as well? 




 Are there articles by economists that day TPP is a good agreement? I want to read them as well as economists who say that it isn't, even though it is known that trade = benefits everyone. 




 In trade, everybody gains so there shouldn't be any losers. 




 What happens when everything is at world equilibrium with goods, wages, prices, etc?  




 How will TPP address the trade deficit is the main concern? So far our trade policy has increased trade deficits. 




 how about the Mexican economy and it's different sub groups in the economy? Shouldn't trade be a benefit for everyone? 




 The middle-man business will obviously want to buy the cheaper-made good because it is in its best economic decision making. 

What are you trying to lead me into? Opportunity Cost? Comparative Advantage?   




 Ya. I am taking economics right now in college, so I might not be a complete expert on this topic, bur I do enjoy learning about it. If I faced off against a person with "supply side-centric", I will probably lose. However, economics is a "dismal science" as noted in the economics subreddit and it really just depends on your opinions.  




 Not all economists are conservative, but the science relies on a capitalist supply and demand graph. 




 I honestly want to see a debate between economists vs protectionism  




 You sure? Don't they have a lot of evidence that say all freetrade = met gain for everyone? 




 Clarify this please? One person is trying to obtain 1 million orders of f500 vs 1 million of another object?  




 Economics the dismal science  




 next what is the point of national borders if companies, workers, migration, and prices of every good in the world are at world equilibrium?  




 Why are there "trade advantages" if freetrade is a net benefit to everybody involved? There shouldn't be any losers in trade.  




 I wonder why doesn't shifts of the labor supply factor into the equation 




 I have always wondered how would Sanders face against an economist on free-trade's pros and cons? Most say yes to TPP and free-trade.  




 I agree. Other countries have amazing modern infrastructure for public transit, trains, airports, seaports, etc 




 there is a correlation with an increase in trade deficits with an increase in freetrade in the past few decades.  




 Any link to articles? 




 The same logic is similar to perfect competition businesses. One Business can't affect the market's price. They take the market's given equilibrium price.  




 It may be true in a way, but I only stated this because people have been saying that protectionism never works at all, even though it had for decades before the Great Depression.  




 I wonder why the Highway Trust Fund isn't getting major headlines since the deadline is coming up. 




 one person making a change in purchases doesn't really affect the market. You need a massive amount of change by buyers or a change in macroeconomics policy making. 




 protectionism worked in America from the beginning of our founding to the 1920s 









 democrats and republicans had liberal, moderate, and conservative wings. parties used to be regional rather than ideology. 














 Most Businesses don't even run on profit. The ones that do run on profit are large corporations or businesses with ideas/goods that are superior to the current market state. Most small businesses close and file into bankruptcy with a couple of years. 

Most infrastructure systems are natural monopoliess. 




 While we debate an issue of whether to even have intercity train travel, Europe, Japan, South Korea, RUSSIA, CHINA, BRAZIL, INDIA, etc are building miles and miles of rail and in some cities within these regions have better transit than us. 




 This is so ridiculous. We need to increase spending on Amtrak.  




 Why do you have Thunder Sea Horse but no Batteryman AAA? You have only 1 specific name for seahorse. 




 Yes but is is easier for republicans to gerrymander because Democrats live in clustered urban areas and minority dominated areas in the west and south. Republicans have a larger access to land size since they come mostly rural areas, which are very sparse. 




 Yet, America was more socialist when our grandparents were young in the 1930s to 1950s. 

NASA was a socialist program to defeat Soviet Union's Capitalist space program. 

Marginal Income Tax Rates were above 90% on the wealthy.

!950s had the largest infrastructure spending in our nation's history with the interstate highways, which would cost 1/2 to 1 trillion dollars in today's money.  




 fusion recovery is recyclable and a bit less of a dead draw than the other fusion cards. 




 -1 or -2 Quickdraw and replace it with chronomaly golden jet, so galaxy soldier's effect goes off.  




 the effective tax rate would still be larger. if today's effective tax rate is 0% and sometimes negative for wealthy people and corporations, then wouldn't the effective tax rate back then be high? According to this "lots of loopholes" logic, today people are receiving a lot of negative tax rates. 




 Like $15 to $30 depending on the rarity? 




 I thought that conservatives believe that entry level jobs are supposed to be "part time"  




 Ya. Either way, nobody could have really expected Bingham with SJ's below average defense to do well against Houston's offense + Bingham's ability to save a penalty.  




 Don't forget that Houston still faces the Toronto's defense that still isn't great.  




 Giles Barnes :D 




 Same. Though, Deric hasn't been doing so well. It might be the absence of Horst. If we can get Horst to start both games, then I will start Deric.  




 ya. Though I just realized that I have 2 more transfers since I only used 1 last round. I am thinking of replacing subs for a good sub.  









 ishizaki should be on people's radar when Zardes and Keane play as forwards.  




 So this is how we can compete against developing countries. Good job America! 




 Galaxy is good in OTK decks.  




 Madison only wanted a republic to stop the masses of the working class to vote away rights of minorities, who were the wealthy landowners at the time. Minorities didn't mean racial minorities, sexual
Minorities, religious minorities, etc. 




 I rather have a majority rules multiparty proportional system which every developed country has. You think they have mob rule and uninformed citizens and vote away rights of minorities?  




 yet we still claim that we are the least corrupt out of the rest of the developed world 




 Right.... Are Republicans going to talk about their support of free-trade, Patriot Act, drug war, privatizing infrastructure, reducing urban development programs, increasing police officers, etc in Cleveland?

Yes. Those are the "solutions" to solve any urban problem in America. Of course, there are other issues by which they will differ themselves from Baltimore like family values, responsibility, education, etc, but you can expect no talk about any of the major issues above.  




 Should have started Ousted instead fo Deric 




 No Wildcard usage :o 




 Only in America where opposing majority rules is good because conservatives fear that they vote away rights of minorities. What James Madison wanted when he created a republic was to stop the rule of majority against the minority land owners. 




 you have got to be kidding me. James Madison wanted a republic so individuals can think for themselves instead of the majority opinion? 




 Roids 




 I want somebody who isn't centrist Hillary and divisive as democratic socialist Sanders but is still electable to the American Public.

I know that incentive by Republicans. I want a candidate, who isn't too centrist like Clinton nor too extreme like Sanders, but still can be electable.  




 I don't see any good transfers investments, if I transfer out Arrieta, Villareal and Jacobson. I only transferred out Gehrig for Polster to save 0.2 million and get a more attack-oriented defender. 









 Republicans want a more liberal candidate so they can gain moderates in the general election. 




 you need a way to get rid of common singles first to make up any remaining losses.  




 I don't think Robles is a good investment even after the double game week, so not really. 




 The yugioh community is basically people with a lot of $$$ already. Those people go to locals, regionals, and nationals. Konami already makes a lot from them because they will always buy. There has to be a reason why investors aren't investing in Konami for the TCG yugioh. 




 Honestly it just depends on the consumers of yugioh. We need to expand the market base so konami will make money in America. 




 I wouldn't recommend getting Powers since Colorado's attack isn't that great. Forwards must score if Powers wants to get assists. Then, again, if you have Colorado Players already on your team from past, keep them there because you will never know what the future will hold and you have double the chances.

 I know. I am just satirizing the people, who say free-trade will improve enviromental laws. 




 For the past couple of seasons, FC Dallas always starts the season strong and then falters for some reason. 




 I captained FINLAY! :D
 




 Yes. I did. :) 




 Free-Trade helps to introduce competition and increase living standards for everyone on all sides. Why should anybody be concerned about the enviroment, if the economy grows? The freetrade and competition will reduce the negative enviroment externalities.  




 Yes. I said that statement to keep people aware that the Republican Party and some Conservatives didn't always support free-trade during their history and Democrats/ some Liberals used to support free-trade.  




 Yes in a way, but not exactly. Both parties had liberal, moderate, and conservative wings.

Democrats purged out their conservative southern faction after the New Deal Coalition and the emergence of the social progressives to the dislike of Southern Democrats. Republicans purged out the Northeastern Liberal Establishment before the 1980s, but began in the 1964 GOP National Conservation, when they don't want moderation at all/hated the Welfare/Big Government (which had grown under 1950s with an increase in marginal income taxes and new spending) 




 I though Conservatives are nationalistic and would oppose free-trade because nations wouldn't live within their means and we would be dependent on other countries for goods and services. Self-Reliance and Personal Responsibility anyone? 




 If free-trade is good for all sides economically, then why don't they just release the trade negotiation details to public before they sign it into law? Is it in secert to ensure US's interests are kept? How? Shouldn't everybody benefit? 




 Keep in mind... Mexico is supposed to increase living standards every year as a result of NAFTA's free-trade. What has happened since then? Drug Cartels, Mass Murders, People still living in shacks, even though they work in manufacturing jobs, pollution in Mexico City, etc. Why are the TPP negotiations in secert, if everybody benefits from trade according to economists? Why do people say that it has to be secert to ensure USA wins a trade? How? i thought in trade... everybody benefits.  




 The Republican Party used to be the party of high tariffs and protectionism. Keep in mind, the US economy was reliant on protectionism until 1920s. During that time, we went through a huge industrial boom. Yes, protectionism was also one of the causes of the World Wars.  




 cool! I never knew that he did this AMA before, so ya. :) 




 Syrus Truesdale with better roids to face off again Yugo's Speedroids 




 What is your favorite yugioh deck? 




 True, but I mean as a result of the political forces.......you had more globalization of the markets, since the 1970s.  




 I know, but basic economics say yes. Also, most economists during the period of 1980 to 2008 agreed that it worked. Right now, most economists still believe free-trade is a good thing. How is not viable? Where are the supposed "economists" who can debate the issue of trade, inequality, taxes, and amount of government spending? 




 It is really a toss-up. Deric seems to be getting a lot of bonus points, even if he doesn't get clean sheets. 




 Isn't trade a good thing? According to economists, all free-trade deals are good economically.  




 Shouldn't the a more freemarket economics, deregulation, a reduction in government services (to reduce deadweight losses) help to expand the economy and reduce inequality during that time? After all, we expanded free-trade, lowered taxes, reduced the size of the government spending, spent more on military, etc? ' 
























 This assumes that demand stays the same even though labor wages is demand. 




 Keep in mind, Japan is automating their labor force. Wages is demand. 




 Some Businesses will shut down because demand has fallen. 




 It is very team based and hard work for low reward of a goal or even a TIE according those people  




 Any sports that rewards players for receiving an excessive force/battle/combat will have floppers. 




 hockey is a very expensive sport for people to play. 




 No. it is those big government Democrats and Obama, who want to keep the Patriot Act and NSA intact. 

Because you know... GOP is for freedom and limited government.

Vote for Jeb Bush! ;) 




 Somehow the NSA and Patriot Act is more important than Environmental Issues and Climate Change.  




 Wanted to repeal the 1964 Civil Rights Act at one time.

Wanted to deregulate the EPA

Wanted to disarm the FDA 




 What are you talking about? 




 Outsourcing is good for the economy because we can focus on service and high-tech jobs. Then, we need to automate those as well. :) 




 It should be obvious by now that big businesses are the only ones who truly have the access to world markets.  









 then we should outsource the entire service industry to machines.  




 If the entire labor source is gone, then demand should should also be gone.  




 To have full comparative advantage, we should outsource the entire manufacturing industry overseas. 




 How will the U.S. Control the most important economic regions if trade enables all countries to mutually cooperate with each other? Trade has no big winners. 




 How exactly this freetrade deal going to counter China, if we already do trade with China, but not in a formal agreement to eliminate tariffs on each other to 0%. We already get a lot of their imports yet China still maintains a higher tariff on us than our tariff on Chinese goods? Freetrade tries to makes all prices and wages in the world close to world equilibrium. 




 What is not to say that we also manipulate our currency as well? 




 No it won't. Free-Trade lifts all boats. Consumers can buy stuff at a cheaper price. Without Trade, your goods will cost a lot more and you will have less choices to choose from. That is why the agreement is secret, so we have to get the best trade offer out there, which lifts all boats overall. There are no losers and trade deficits don't matter because..... you just imported more goods than you export, which means consumers are having a lot of choices. 

Back in the 1920s, when manufacturing jobs were present, how come nobody wanted blacksmithing jobs back?
Why make stuff for our own usage when we can just get items from other places for cheap? We need to depend on other growing economies for our growth. :)


 




 If you agree to buy a lot of my big business products and natural resources, I will buy your bridge for cheaper than the other guy. But don't tell the other guy, okay?
 




 My only hope to get Polster into my starting lineup is to hope Ishizaki, Davies, or Woodberry doesn't play in the next game.... . 




 Trade Agreements are secret so American Businesses and Consumers can get the best trade deal offer. If we open it up, then we might lose in a freetrade deal that lifts all boats because there would be too many amendments and hidden secrets exposed. 

 




 Really annoying people. Like sure spend $80 on a box and destroy everything lol 




 I have researched a lot of strange ideology combinations that try to appear "moderate" like:

Liberal Conservative, Progressive Conservative, Compassionate Conservative, Third Way Liberals, and Conservative Liberals

I know there is a slight difference between each one, but do they fit in centrism?  




 Ya or you can run 3 cores and 1 machine dup, but have a card where you discard a card. 




 Personally, it is good to have cyber valleys on the field to stall, but they aren't "cyber dragon". 

It really depends though. If you have 3 cores and 1 machine dup, what happens if you already used 3 cores, you would need a card that has discard eff? 




 You don't need 3 Power Bonds because you will probably won't fusion summon 3 times. Why have 2 machine dups, if there isn't 2 targets for it? You don't want to dead draw it.  




 Will some of the lore will be altered or not exist?  




 You provide one team. how about QPR, Wigan, etc? Those teams enter the EPL and then get relegated. There are more teams that get relegated than teams who compete well in the EPL. In a perfect world, each EPL team wins the league every 20 years (assuming no relegation). Of course, we know that it is impossible, since no league in any sport is that competitive. We see the same to similar top tier teams in the top nearly every year and it lasts for decades.    




 Why is nobody talking about the trade deficit ? has freetrade helped to decrease our current trade deficit or do trade deficits don't matter since trade lifts all boats? 




 Simple. American small businesses don't have the massive world outreach. Foreigners don't know if there is a small business in America who sells similar items to an American Big Business. A small business can't really set up shop or manufacturing place in a foreign company as easily. 




 Agricultural jobs were never middle class. They have always been low wage and in need of subsidizes.  




 It will happen once every country engages in near freetrade. Then everything is at world equilibrium in prices and wages. 




 it is weird though because usually deficits of any kind is bad in mathematical perspective, but trade deficits is fine according to current economic thinking. As long as you engage in trade, then it lifts all boats. 




 Yes that also works but it is not competitive since the good players on the bottom teams leave the team.  




 The reason is because the top flight teams want to stay in the top flight. Very good players always want to go to the best team, so it inherently favors the top teams. What is the point of joining a bottom tier premier league team, if they will be relegated in the future? 




 people don't know that taxation on limited vertical supply with a diagonal demand curve makes the consumers pay nearly all the tax. 




 Watch Nelson Rockefeller's speech to the GOP national convention in 1964. Some of his remarks can be applied to today's time era. 




 I love my state and my constituents, but I hate your politicians and your interests.

Low Approval Rating of Congress, yet nearly 90%+ incumbency.
 




 Who cares. Just agree with it because..... it is a freetrade agreement. Trade = Good Economics :)

- Nearly Every Economist, Business leader, Conservative Republicans, and Pro-Trade Democrats. 




 Rockefeller Republicans and Progressive/Liberal Republicans would like to have a word with you. lol

 




 Nelson Rockefeller (the moderate Rockefeller Republicans were booed by the Goldwater Conservatives in the 1964 GOP National Convention), Dwight Eisenhower (desegregated the Southern Schools from Conservative Dixicrats + continued the New Deal + warned about the military industrial complex), Richard Nixon (who enacted the EPA and basically was Keynesian in economics), Teddy Roosevelt (one of the leaders of the progressive movement), and Abraham Lincoln (freed the slaves and opposed the States Rights Movement + Supported the idea of the federal government assistance in building railroads) would be shocked at how conservative and southern/rural the Republican Party currently is. 

Also, Bob Dole stated, "I thought I was a conservative, but weve got some in Congress now who are so far right theyre about to fall out of the Capitol."

http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/04/23/bob-dole-says-the-republican-party-is-way-more-conservative-than-it-was-even-20-years-ago-hes-right/ 




 Yep. :D
 




 Ya. It is so impossible to summon this out except from a cyber dragon nova deck.  




 Somewhat...but it also tells us that teams are unwilling to play starting players often during double game weeks, so they can rest players, etc 




 barbaroid the ultimate battle machine  




 Exactly, Rockefeller denounced extremism from both the left and right and was booed because of that. 




 LOL Both parties had liberal, moderate, and conservative wings that battled each other out for control. Those factions were very regional. progressive republicans and southern democrats found their true ideological homes now. 




 But freetrade benefits the entire economy overall say economists and business leaders. Think about the cheap prices that we get in goods and think of the markets that you wouldn't have without trade such as coffee, Japanese cars, and Accessories from the Middle East. Do Americans want to pay higher prices for goods that they consume today? Probably not. tariffs are bad. 




 If people back then had a 90% marginal income tax rate and people say that the effective tax rate was much lower.....and if today people's marginal income tax rate is around 30 to 40%, but the effective tax rate can reach 0% for some people, Wouldn't the effective tax rate back then be higher than today's effective tax rate? 




 The effective tax rate back then would still be higher than the effective tax rate today.  




 However, I only have 3 defenders. Should I place Bedell on the team and put Davies and Polster on the bench, so if Polster gets 1 point, then I could just replace Bedell with Davies. If Polster gets more than 4 points, He will be subbed into Bedell, but do I get to replace Woodberry with Davies?  




 I never really tried out this tactic, but good to know. :D Thanks! 




 :| 




 I had Rolfe earlier in the weeks prior.  




 Why three Artifact Sanctums, but only 2 Artifacts?

Batteryman Industrial Strength is more of a side-deck card against slower decks. It is a dead draw, if you don't have an engine to throw thunder cards into the grave. I recommend Thunder Dragons.+ 1 Hand Destruction than 2 Cardcar Ds

You could add Abyss Stungray, but it is trap monster, level 5, Thunder 









 Like you said. Drei's effect is manual and doesn't say that you use in another player's turn.  




 Firebirds is an amazing name

 he is probably a pawn from the fusion dimension. After all, he noticed cuz summoning and commented with a strange tone. Plus, he has purple stuff, which is fusion dimension stuff. 




 I have a feeling that the guy with purple hair at the end is from the fusion dimension.  




 I might consider voting for Kasich for President, but given that he will choose the next Supreme Court Justice....Probably not.  




 Kasich is one of the most decent Republican candidates out of the ones listed.

Rubio and Paul are semi-okay in my opinion, but not preferred. 


 




 Ishizaki :) 




 I am just stating the position of people with academic knowledge in economics and business. I don't necessary agree with them, but I do agree with Reich's view on some concerning aspects.  




 Mexico, where the USA claims that their economy has gotten better, but illegal immigration still is a problem from there.  




 Ya, but I personally don't believe all the "talking points" of pro-free-trade in full. Yes, they do have a point, but there are lots of anti-freetrade points as well.  




 http://projects.nytimes.com/44th_president/stimulus

Include Healthcare Spending, Environmental Cleanup, Research, Housing, etc 




 It doesn't make sense at the moment because the current transit and spread of development isn't focused on rail nor public transit, but rather cars. Keep in mind, you can't expand roads within cities and highways can't be expanded if development is already there, so there should be other modes of transit, if cities don't want massive congestion problems during rush-hour.  




 "i think the congestion of highways has far more to do with an increased supply of motor vehicles as opposed to increased supply of highways" 

Cars are unusable, if nobody rides them. If the overall economy gains more cars, not everybody is using all the cars. Transportation is the act of people going from place to place. Once highways are more open, congestion and time travel would be less, which in turn decreases usage of commuter rail + public transit, which moves those people onto the highways. That is induced demand. There is no point in public transit because the lifestyle is already revolved around cars. Yes, if you live in an area with population not growing and build bigger highways, yes there will be less congestion.  




 Infrastructure spending is necessary in any urban area. without it, you will have heavy sprawl with 8 lane highways one way in some highways in Georgia. Plus, you still have traffic+congestion from induced demand, so you would need to build even more lanes and roads.  




 Building more Highways causes induced demand, which will keep them congested, if population continues to grow. Also, highways and roads take up more space than train tracks. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_demand 




 Tax Cuts, Loans for Businesses, Subsidizes, Unemployment benefits, Education Loans, Education Spending, Infrastructure Spending, etc 




 They just point to an easier shift for workers to go into better "industries", lower prices of goods for consumers, businesses doing well, developing countries gaining better living standards. 




 There are no losers in free-trade in the overall perspective according to people with knowledge on trade economics. 




 http://projects.nytimes.com/44th_president/stimulus

 




 Yes. The same applies for military spending for soldiers. Healthcare spending for doctors. Subsidizes for Businesses. Tax Cuts for Taxpayers. 




 about around 40-110 billion dollars out of the 800 billion dollars went to infrastructure. This is little compared to the 1 trillion dollars+ we actually need. 




 because the stimulus was 1/3 tax cuts. Infrastructure was only up to 100 billion of the 800 billion allocated for the stimulus. You need to do research on the stimulus.  




 The U.S. Chamber of Commerce also supports it as well even though they were against it decades ago. 




 Also, Some Highways there are 8 lanes on both sides and both are still congested during rush hour.  




 then supports and votes for anti-pork barrel projects, wasteful spending, abolishing gas tax, etc politicians. The cycle continues. 




 Obama also wants us to get out of our cars by discouraging car usage. Thanks Obama! 




 This is generally a problem in the south, but also in Michigan with regards to the gas tax increase. they don't want money spent on public transit but rather on just roads and highway expansions.  




 It was only around 40 to 100 billion dollars of the 800 billion allocated for the stimulus. 




 Laguardia airport, Amtrak, Public transit in cities not in the Northeast, west coast, and sections of the Midwest  




 Cost too much. Citizens vote down any gas tax hike. Budget deficits. Some view infrastructure as pork barrel spending. Some blame inefficient government ex: house members on Amtrak 




 I could honestly see conservatives saying, "Democrats run the cities and manage bad infrastructure. Thus, Democrats create bad infrastructure, while Republicans in rural states have better infrastructure because our roads and highways are paved." 

^^^

Ignoring the fact that infrastructure maintenance and project expansions+modernization costs insane amounts of money.....  




 What!?!?! You tell me that we should reduce the supply of our defenses? We are #1, so stop trying to make America look weak and broken. ;)

Think about the other countries, when they see America disarming. :| 




 But people need to be educated in order to get to higher paying jobs such as Engineering. Entry Level Jobs are not a living. :)

If Conservatives used the same logic for military spending, "Soldiers support increased military spending because they benefit from it." Bad. 




 Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Bernie Sanders, etc 




 I am pretty sure Rand would want better infrastructure, but I believe that he would side more on the property rights side, when the government needs to reorganize the land for infrastructure projects. Also, he would be more pro-privatization. For example, Amtrak would be fully privatized.  




 Yes, but I don't think Congress will pass such a plan in the near future. :\ 




 I bet that they would even go as far to say "Military = Socialism"  




 Reducing the Gas Tax would reduce revenues for the Highway Trust Fund. but....

The real question is whether a reduction in the gas tax will encourage more people on cars traveling or not. Elasticity question.

 




 I posted this because of the video. I feel like the article is pretty straightforward from what we have heard for months now.

 Nico's voice is fine, if you have watched Yugioh GX. Zuzu's voice is what I would expect. Personally, I wished Yuya's voice was similar to that of Jaden, since at the moment, it does sound a bit annoying, but I can get used to it. Gong is what throws me off. Like....Texan Voice? LOL 




 Yuya's, Gong's, and Skip's voice don't really match. Why is Gong a Texan? 




 Why do the voices sound so strange? 




 Yet Japan still manufactures cars for its own citizens and for export. Something that American manufacturing can't seem to do.

 What midfielder for less than $7.9 million is good for this week and maybe a couple of weeks ahead? 




 Tolls on all highways and major roads around Detroit. (People don't leave the city. If people wanted to avoid tolls, they go on other roads = more congestion = more business development). Cut Taxes on houses, businesses, and industry, which will attract people from outside the city. Add more police patrols to reduce crime. Build from the inner core and expand outwards. Build Public Transit Infrastructure, once there is density. Education, healthcare, parks, social services, etc later on.  




 The top card is the bottom card...

 Modern because we decided that we should send our factories over there and China decided to explore capitalism. Double Edge Sword? We want to "help developing countries", but doing so might hurt us. Then, we complain that we aren't growing as fast as them even though China has more people and it should be expected that they will have the largest GDP in the world. The real surprise is how the USA maintained its economic power for so long.  




 I agree. Over-specialization can bad. Look what happened to Detroit, when automation and outsourcing happened. If any major war. financial crisis, or whatever happens between the US and other countries, we wouldn't have the facilities to produce our own goods. We would be hit with a recession first, if that happens, since other countries would block imports to us. Prices will rise for all of us. In reality, nobody knows what the true cost of goods are, since there are so many external factors.

It is interesting though. Could the USA should export more goods than imports in goods to pay down our trillions of dollars of debt?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_deficits_hypothesis

"The twin deficits hypothesis, also called the double deficit hypothesis or twin deficits anomaly, is a macroeconomic proposition that there is a strong link between a national economy's current account balance and its government budget balance.[1]" 




 How so? 




 Economists say: 

Think about the comparative advantage of producing in "developing" countries! (This is a better term than "Third World", since this isn't a Cold War setting). 

We get cheap goods. Living Standards increase for developing countries. We specialize in something else rather than manufacturing. :) 




 It is giant space where there are lots of railroad tracks, truck/storage facilities, and lots of parking area near south Boston and the South End. 




 Yep. it is also interesting how they defend secret negotiations so that the USA will "gain from trade", so they can get the. "Best deal possible" even though it contradicts the idea that trade lifts all boats and there supposedly no overall "losers" in the macro sense in trade. 




 A mixture of sarcasm and presenting the economics of freetrade  




 Economists say that freetrade is always good. it is only bad news for a few people. Consumers, exporters, living standards for developing countries all gain from TPP. :) 




 No! Nearly all Academic scholars and economists say that freetrade is always good. :) 




 The Boston 2024 Main Olympic Stadium is a great location. 




 They have been known for weeks. I just wanted to know other potential relatively cheap defenders. 




 if TPP was the most "progressive" trade deal to ever be made to reduce the effects of outsourcing, environmental concerns, labor rights, human rights, poor quality control, etc, How does the Republican Party stand to gain from this trade deal? Do you really think that they will agree to a progressive trade deal? 




 TRADE! Are you against trade? Why dislike access to foreign goods and globalization? Say goodbye to cheap prices! Save manufacturing? modern Luddites? Protectionism? Bad economics much? 




 Doesn't economics have to do with government policy? Even the minimum wage topic causes headaches among experienced economists lol 




 It is secret because we need to make sure that US gains from trade and don't lose even though freetrade benefits everyone. 




 people should support TPP because freetrade is good. Most economists say so. Protectionism is bad. Living standards have increased across the world. Wouldn't you believe so from globalization? products are cheaper. Horray! Specialization for all countries. USA should outsource most of its manufacturing and shift to high tech!. trade deficits don't matter. Because consumers gains + our money is reinvested in capital will come back to the USA.  




 Toia isn't really a good pick because he has shown to get 1 point for games. If you have money, I recommend Polster.  




 Just agree with the trade bill because most to all economists say that trade = good :) 




 I just want to know some potential cheap defenders, who may or may not be semi-starters. It looks like they won't be, so.... I'll just keep my eye on them for the future :) 




 Dia is worth $4.5 million and in the last three games..... started for 90 minutes in each with clean sheets in all three. 

Marquez is worth $4.7 million and in the last 4 games... started for all 90 minutes and has two clean sheets.

 




 I had Deric, but I switched him out for Bush since he has fallen from his original 5.0 value. I could replace Ousted with Deric to save some money. Just need to hope Deric and Houston's defense will be better in the upcoming weeks. :\ 









 Which midfielder is better to get in round 15 and expect to be better/play more over the next 3 or 4 rounds? Kaka, Dempsey, Castillo, Nguyen? - all over $10.0 million 




 YES!! 




 Also governments can fiscally alter prices and costs of goods with subsidizes and regulations, so nothing is really free in trade. All Governments engage in some sort of protectionism. 




 The Republican Party used to be pro high tariffs to support US manufacturing. Democrats wanted low tariffs to export agriculture goods. 




 It is obvious since big businesses are the truly the only ones who can fully outsource production and gain profits. Can a small business decide that it wants to relocate? Is a consumer in a foreign country going to compare products between a small business and a big business American company? How many foreign companies are on par with Western big businesses in terms of size? Can migrants move to countries to strive for higher wages as easily as businesses can strive for lower costs? Should immigration be open doors for all countries to eliminate protectionism? 




 Mhm. Budget Deficits also don't matter. ;) 




 You would need major investments in High-Speed Rail, which is going cost upwards of 100+billion dollars to 1 trillion dollars intially.  




 Why should the Northeast fund small town airports in the middle of nowhere? Fund it yourselves! 




 Boo! Somebody in those states should campaign on increasing Amtrak spending in the next election. 




 Trade Deficits don't matter at all! ;) 




 Freetrade is good. We get cheaper products, more competition, more consumers of our goods, increased specialization (our economy = high tech), help developing countries, etc. economics 101

We should outsource our entire manufacturing overseas! Also trade deficits don't matter! Google it and you see articles saying that trade deficits don't matter. :)

 If you are in Canada, then the setting should be pretty LGBT friendly. Of course, you always try to go to a locals with a more urban setting, since those settings tend to be more socially liberal than more rural settings. I mean.... you wouldn't want to go to a locals in rural Alberta, right? lol 




 I am not a member of the LGBT group, but it really depends on what your locals location is....

Also, I doubt people will notice, if you are "passable". Just make sure to keep the LGBT issue at a minimum.

Are you in a conservative or liberal state? Are you in a rural, small town, suburban, or urban setting? 




 Trade Deficits don't matter! :) 




 True. Also Trade Deficits don't matter because as long as we keep importing cheap goods more than we export in goods, we gain the benefits of a globalized trade. :D 




 The left should agree with TPP because it is a freetrade agreement which is good for everyone and helps developing countries. Nearly all economists say Trade is good. 




 The inability to get stuff done in a very gerrymandered, polarized, changing America.  




 No. If the GOP manages to nominate a moderate nominee in the general election, the GOP could win swing states as the rightwing groups will come out in force to vote. All of Obama's coalition of voters won't necessarily vote for Sanders.  




 Nope. Walmart is still in business as well as many others. :) 




 Nobody is listening because trade is always good. End all tariffs. we should outsource most of our manufacturing overseas because it will cost less, give us cheaper products, increase competition, and help developing countries reduce poverty. Trade Deficits don't matter. :)

 It doesn't make sense, since the GOP controls the House and the Senate. Also, do you really think the GOP has a comprehensive plan after cutting Amtrak spending and had many years to propose a long term plan for transportation? 




 then they complain that gas price increases are the fault of the president and when gas prices fall, then it isn't the president's policies.  




 tolls do divert traffic to roads without traffic which can be good for businesses in areas with low traffic congestion. 




 George Pataki - He is semi reasonable with some liberal views on economic policy and environmental policy but does have some neoconservative views with military, NSA, and Marijuana.

Rand Paul - Libertarian who has some views that are close to social liberalism but most of his economic policy is at odds with many progressives 

Marco Rubio - He is a candidate who appeals to Hispanics with general conservative views with a sprinkle of liberal view.
 




 He should get a trial, but he should be able to come back without spending most of his life in jail or receiving harm because he did expose some stuff that infringes on people's liberties, while did break some rules.  




 But... Well... Who wants to pay $4 per a gallon of gas? We need to go back to $1 per a gallon. ;)

 Free-Trade is always good for America says most intelligent economists. Even if 5 chapters is  about trade, Lower Prices for Consumer means that overall welfare has increased. Trade is done in a comparative advantage way, which will boost more GDP. Do people really want tariffs everywhere?

Outsourcing and Automation is good for society, so we can focus on other industries.  




 Watch Nelson Rockefeller's speech to the GOP National Convention in 1964. Then, you compare it to Barry Goldwater's speech. You will see how the GOP has changed.

 Southern democrats and southern republicans voted against it. 




 Yes, but do the new kind of jobs replace the original aggregate demand done from worker wages?  




 Wages is demand. Machines don't buy stuff. machines also depend entirely on electricity and energy.
