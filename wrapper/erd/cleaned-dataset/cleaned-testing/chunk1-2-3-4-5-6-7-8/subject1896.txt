 Every department pays differently. Attractions isn't that great. 

We get some evenings during the holidays for just CMs. Grad Nites suck ass... but we have had them since the 50's and yes we run all the rides from 10p-3a. 




 Yes I do :)

It was simple. I came down here for school and already knew I wanted to work here. I applied online (disney.com/careers) and a week later I'm hired. 

I specifically work in attractions and in guest show operations. I work at the World Famous Jungle Cruise and Big Thunder Mountain. At guest show operations, I make sure that the parades and fireworks go smoothly from the guests' point of view and I guest interact all day and get to "make magic" as we say. It's wonderful.

It's not hard to be cheerful because it's freaking Disneyland. Mostly everyone is having an extremely good time. I come to work after breaking up with my girlfriend of 4 years and get lost in the show of Disneyland... which is an extremely good thing. Walt made Disneyland to do just that, have it's inhabitants forget about the outside world. 

I actually hear more funny things from adults! The other night at guest show operations (GSO) I was talking to a group of middle aged women and we were shooting the breeze and joking and laughing. The apparent leader said "Michael, we are romance novel writers and we want to write a story about a strong male Asian lead now!" I couldn't stop laughing all night.
Once I had a very foreign Asian man walk up to me outside the Jungle Cruise asking for the King Kong ride (which is at Universal Studios) with a California Adventure (the adjoining park to Disneyland) map.  




 Not this weekend, sorry man! It's down for about a week. Making some safety changes. 




 I'll say them like this:
The "friends" of the characters like Mickey and Minnie that walk around and take pictures, are mainly women except for the tall ones like Goofy.

There is a basketball hoop at the top of the Matterhorn (fact).

In retail, if a CM says "customer" they are referring to shoplifters.  




 I'm going to say this in terms of attractions (which is my line of business), but it also applies to retail, food, outdoor vending, etc. 

You get hired into a certain location. In attractions, you get either Tomorrowland, New Orleans/Critter Country, Fantasyland/Toontown, and Adventureland/Frontierland/Main Street USA (The Best). 
You are "landlocked," and are only allowed to learn the attractions in your area. If you wish to go to a different area, you may, but you would lose your seniority and knowledge from the current area.

So you hire in at a hire-in attraction, something easy and not too dependent on fast paced thinking or experience. Then once you accrue seniority and rapport, you may cross train to other attractions. For instance, I get to work at Big Thunder Mountain, The Jungle Cruise, and Parades next week over a five day period.  




 Have fun over there... but when you're ready for some real magic, come to the west coast! 




 Coming right up http://i.imgur.com/pWyQs.jpg 




 I really enjoyed the World Showcase at Epcot. As for a specific ride, I really enjoyed the really cheesy Great Movie Ride in MGM Studios and also the Rockin Rollercoaster. All great rides that play to all sorts of audiences and audience wishes.  




 I've been a Disneyland enthusiast ever since I was little. I went to WDW (Walt Disney World) for the first time in May 2011. I loved the originality and innovation and execution of Epcot and Animal Kingdom. I really didn't like Magic Kingdom and MGM Studios. 

It's such a large place... it's an event park hopping. At Disneyland, it's not like that. You walk 100 paces to get to the adjoining park.  




 On these guys, I sized down one. This was with the intention of curing them myself... as in like fading and all that stuff. So I did that, I cold soaked to get rid of the excess dye and wore them for 8mo hardcore before any problems occurred (see my comment below).
The cinch is what sold me at first. It was really neat. However, the more I wore them, the less I felt a need to call attention to the cinch and the more it just became a thing for me to enjoy.  




 I purchased these denims on two separate occasions. I spent 8mo in my first pair (which I came across in a shop in San Francisco) until I busted a whole in the crotch. It was a tragedy.... so I went back and luckily they still had bigger sizes (I wear a 36) and so I bought the last two pairs in my size they had. 
At this point in my style life, I was really into curing my denim on my own. I was into APC first, then PBJ, then Samurai, then I tried LVC and loved them. 
As far as I know, they only make indigo. It's all I had. And for the record, my third pair is still alive and look awesome. I should post a pic... 




 This exact pair of denim. 




 I have 3 pairs of these. Take care of them and they'll take care of you!  




 Whoa.... 




 More like... it's a hard dock life....

 NoMo is amazing. Henley and Pralle are like hotels. You are not allowed to chill around... you need to be inside at all time if you want to chill (basically). At NoMo, doors can be open, you can walk up and down the aisle and meet different people or ask people for things or chill inside the quad which is in the middle of the housing. Really awesome, I didn't even live there last year. 




 Thanks! No bragging but occasionally me or my friends get cat called or get numbers passed to us but we never solicit, even though I'm tempted sometimes admittedly.  




 Know how to use fast pass. Know that you can ask for the front row on any attractions. Know that you can bring food and drink into Disneyland.  




 I only look like Grant because I'm Asian. Not opposed.

Weirdest rule... maybe that I'm not allowed to use the phrase "Olympics." I have to say "summer games" if I want to talk about them because the Olympics are owned by NBC and Disney owns ABC. 




 Neither. Just bored and thought y'all may be interested. 




 Working on it.  




 The people who do it love it. The crowds are what make it not monotonous. Each crowd responds differently. There are always new ad libs on every boat. 




 Orlando info is true. The fact that it's underground is an after thought. Pirates of The Caribbean ride at Disneyland is mostly underground for what it's worth. 

And the head info is false. 




 I dislike the Tiki Room songs more than Small World. 




 Thank you! I'm being very careful.  




 The only times I see children cry are when they are spoiled and don't get what they want from their parents (candy, toys, food), when they are too scared to ride a ride their parents are taking them on, and (most relevant to me daily) when they don't make height checks. 




 Soak in cold water first to get the dye out. If you don't like the sizing after, warm soak it for 30min. 




 I'm not saying anything that could get me terminated. 




 It may be because this is not called a Fast Pass. It's called a Guest Assistance Card. These are awesome for people that need them. All you need to do is go to Guest Relations and tell them why you need them and what your disability restricts you from doing ie standing too long. People abuse this shit all the time and it sucks. 

The card lets the holder and up to 6 guests go through the shortest route to the attraction. 




 Ohhhh yes! I couldn't tell if y'all were visiting the school and stoked about it or students. I was at Big Thunder that day. 




 I like the Remember! fireworks spectacular because it showcases the beautiful and nostalgic and classic attractions of Disneyland past and present.

 This is something a lot of parents should be doing all the time that my mother did for me:
My mom is a very popular lady amongst her peers and at her workplace. So, whenever she would take me around her friends, family members I hadn't met yet, or people she ran into at the store, she'd always make sure I fully introduced myself and started even just some small talk with the person(s). Instead of "This is my son Michael" she'd turn to me and say "Michael, would you like to introduce yourself?" Really simple. I'd generally reply with "Hi, it's nice to meet you. I'm Michael. Shellani's son" to which her friends would usually laugh... haha. It's funny to think about now. But really, I see too many shy ass kids around as kids and as teenagers and adults I deal with every day. Could've benefitted from what I did.  




 Great title. 




 Okay well I'm glad you tried. A nice technique to try when speaking to GR (something you may already have tried) is stating at the end that this really upsets you because you really an innocently messed up then asking if there is anything more they could do for you. I'm sure they'll try to offer another solution, but alternatively I can't say I'd be terribly surprised with the amount of fake claims they receive. Just be genuine and innocent as possible when dealing with GR.   




 Thank you very much for not making the top half "Socially Awesome" 




 I love Basil, but I have no doubt he's gonna fuck that carpet right up. Be careful! :) 




 I am a Cast Member at Disneyland and the NUMBER ONE thing you need to do is email Guest Relations at Disneyland and explain to them your situation. Do not tell them you bought this ticket from some random dude since that's not permitted. You may instead imply that you were gifted it... They will help you out. We work to make sure guests are happy and not to put people SOL.  




 Yeah... that's enough Internet for today. 




 Great title.

 I work at BTM.
We are closing to first and foremost change the operating system. Right now we run on a computer system currently. We have a pretty sophisticated system, but it requires a lot of upkeep and is rivaled by the system of Indiana Jones, which spaces their vehicles automatically, preventing backups.
Second, because we are already going down for a year, we are taking this time to change the 30+ year old track. Same ride, better track/brake system.
Third, we are extending the exit platform to accommodate more people/wheelchairs. 
Fourth, we are improving show effects and in turn, replacing lost show effects such as potentially the return of the earthquake ending, or I have heard rumor that it may be much different...
Fifth, behind the scenes stuff like adding phone systems to backstage areas and on stage areas that need them.

Hope this helped.

The wood above my head is cracking from the weight above-- I'm underground. Rapidly, more dirt fills the empty space around me. I try to fight back. *Is this how I die?

 I just recently left in Feb. But I know a lot about the interviews and how recruiters think.

Like a previous poster said, smile. Always smile.
Don't talk about how much you love Disneyland. They don't care who your favorite character is or how many times you've been.
When they ask you your number one concern, it is ALWAYS safety.
Think about how the four keys of Disneyland (Safety, Courtesy, Show, Efficiency) affect your role and answer the questions in that way. You're not supposed to know those keys right now so don't talk about knowing them but casually mentioning them would be prime (i.e. "I recognize that to be a great CM, I have to be courteous to all guests when performing my role."
That's another one: don't forget to think of yourself when answering questions as a part of a show, a cast member with a role. 
That's about it. They typically offer the jobs on the spot if they like you.

Good luck. Say hi to the Mouse for me.

If you're lucky, your store is close by and not 45min away like mine!

 I used to work at Disneyland. The family was composed of 2 boys (about 7, 9), a mom, and a dad. I was working on the Jungle Cruise, driving the boat, and telling the jokes. 

One of the kids kept pulling down the throttle and another kept grabbing the gun (which, contrary to popular belief, is a real gun that has the capability of shooting real bullets, but we use blanks that can still fuck someone's eardrums or skin up). I repeatedly asked the parents to control their children as to stop fucking around with everyone else's experience. They kind of just said "Stop that" and kept taking pictures.

Finally one of the twerps took it a step further and shot the gun. I stopped the show and drove back to the dock, conferred with my lead before unloading, and had a manager and security meet us to escort the family out of the park. I didn't hear anything else from it.  




 Good thing the address is on the ke-oh wait.

 So as the title suggests, I used to operate rides in Disneyland. I was there for a couple years and finally quit in February 2013.

I've had much more than my fair share of completely shitty guests. But the most common occurrence is when I'm at the "group" position and we ask how many is in your party so we can divvy y'all into rows and the person says "2" so I put them in row (let's say) 5 and that's the last row in the train so I hold the next group and that person says "OH BUT WE'RE WITH THEM!" (sorry for that monster sentence)

So one night, I was at Big Thunder Mountain and it was nearing the end of my Grad Nite shift (Grad Nite is a night for graduating seniors from all around SoCal to hang out in Disneyland with free reign from 10p-2a). A group of 6 really fat and loud students come up the stairs. The couple behind them scream from behind saying this group cut them. At Disneyland, we can't do anything about that unless we see, but believing them, I bring the couple out of line and reserve a special spot for them.
Now, I ask how many the students are. Not listening, I ask again. Finally, one of the people in the back hits the person in the front to acknowledge me.
"Haha what?"
"How many in your group?"
"2"
Here we go. Not trying to go through this turmoil and dually seeing an opportunity for some fun, I ask: 
"Are you guys 2 or all together here?"
"Oh we're all together."

So at Big Thunder, we don't have seats, we have rows that look like benches that are made to hold 2 adults or three children. But we're encouraged to pack the rows to three. 

"Rows 6 and 7."

I watch the 6 enter two rows and slowly watch them realize that this is going to be the tightest ride of their lives. Squeeeeeeeeeeeeeezing tight they finally managed to pull the lap bar down one click. We sent the train. When they came back it was like watching a clown car unload.

I gave the other couple who told me all about their problems in line a front row spot. 




 Maybe...

Wait for it....

**They go there.** 




 Armed with loaded downvotes.

 RIP. 









 My father passed when I was 4. Now I'm nearly 20, and the only thing that lacks in retrospect was having someone to teach me the things my mom couldn't. 

See, when you're a single parent, you have to act as both parents. My mom tried, and for the most part, she succeeded. However, she couldn't teach me things like how to shave, for instance. How to fight, how to pick up girls (in a way), and general guy-to-guy stuff. But I wholeheartedly believe that having a single parent doesn't affect whether you can achieve excellence or not.
