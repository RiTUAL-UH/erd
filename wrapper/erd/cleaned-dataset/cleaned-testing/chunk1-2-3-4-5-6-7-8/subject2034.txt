 A relevant book on this mass extinction scenario is Under a Green Sky, by Peter D. Ward (2008). Its hypothesis is that global warming will shut down ocean circulation, resulting in the formation of a Canfield ocean (after geologist Donald Canfield). Warm, stagnant and low in oxygen, the oceans will bloom with bacteria that release hydrogen sulfide gas as a metabolic by-product. Hydrogen sulfide is the highly toxic gas that smells of rotten eggs, and its accumulation in the atmosphere will turn the sky a shade of green, hence the title of the book. This concentration of gas should be toxic to most terrestrial organisms as well, hence the terrible sweep of these extinction events.

According to the Wiki entry on the Canfield ocean, Donald Canfield thinks this process is triggered at a carbon dioxide concentration of 1000 parts per million. We are currently at 400 ppm. At the current rate of anthropomorphic increase, we would not breach this threshold for, perhaps, a couple of centuries, but the given that we may have already activated positive feedback loops for the release of planetary carbon stores (especially artic methane), it may already be too late for humanity to avoid seeing a green sky.

As for the leadership our corporate/democratic systems provide us, let us consult the prophet, Lewis Carroll. From his Second Testament, Through the Looking Glass:

Tweedledum and Tweedledee/ Agreed to have a battle; For Tweedledum said Tweedledee/ Had spoiled his nice new rattle.
Just then flew down a monstrous crow/ As black as a tar barrel; Which frightened both the heroes so,/ They quite forgot their quarrel.

I wish the monstrous crow would come! thought Alice.

Be careful what you wish for, Alice.
 




 I am coming late to this thread and so apologize for any redundancy in my comments. First, let me touch on a few points of agreement.
Yes, in some aspects, Vonnegut is a mediocre writer and often seems to be deliberate in this underachievement. He acknowledged this through his literary alter ego, Kilgore Trout, whom he describes as a terrible writer with great story ideas. The protagonist, Billy Pilgrim can be viewed as suffering PTSD (battle fatigue as they euphemized it in that time), or he may be entering a psychosis unrelated to his wartime trauma, a fear that haunts Vonneguts work and private life. Slaughterhouse-Five and Catch-22 do share a core, satirical vision  both their participation in the Good War and the world that resulted from it left both authors disillusioned.
However, Vonneguts loss of faith is complete and his literary vision bleaker. Sirens of Titan questions the purpose of civilization. Cats Cradle is a Cold War meditation on the inevitable and likely accidental doom that will result from the combination of human nature and high technology. Mother Night twists the concepts of ethics and loyalty. And so it goes, through most of his writing.
Vonnegut intended Slaughterhouse-Five as more than an anti-war novel. Anti-war novels are a futile exercise, he mocked: Why does not someone write a novel opposing a future Ice Age? I understand the book as a post-Christian attempt to find some consolation for our dreadful existence in this indifferent Universe. Here, having no copy of the book, I must paraphrase, On the planet Tralfamadore, they have no interest in Jesus Christ, but do appreciate Darwin, who taught that everything that lives is meant is die and that corpses are improvements. In remedy, let us become unstuck in time. Then, as the Tralfamadorians do, we will see our lives are not a journey of discrete events that have purpose or transcendence, but as an eternal landscape of ambiguous contingency, from which we are free to choose what landmarks we ponder.
It is a book that I admire.
 

















































 What a crank! Brain altering nanobots in fifteen years? Check that against the development time for a simple, pharmacological compound, which does not include "user may experience hacking and occasional malware" in its list of potential side effects. If Kurzweil is more than a figurehead in the department of engineering, trotted out to garner publicity, then it may soon be time to sell your Google stock. 




 This stunt is not space travel, only the world's most expensive amusement ride. The pompous billionaire prattles about orbiting Virgin Galactic hotels, yet orbital flight would require an expenditure of approx. 18 fold more energy and a much more robust vehicle.    




 Kevin Kellys book What Technology Wants (2010) has convinced me that our technological development is now an autonomous entity  the Technium. The Technium has an imperative to expand beyond this planet  it is difficult to imagine it will be content to rest, even inside a Matrioshka brain, to contemplate its virtual navel. So, the solution to the Fermi Paradox may reduce to one fundamental race: Can the Technium escape its resource limitations before it experiences a disabling shock?

Presently, the Technium depends on two critical planetary resources for its progress. One is the potential energy content of the Earths crust, which is stored primarily in fossil fuels and concentrated deposits of metallic ores and minerals. The Technium is rapidly consuming the most useful of these given resources, and the lowest grade deposits may not support its extra-planetary expansion. The second critical resource is the Biosphere. While tigers, whales and redwoods are of no consequence to it, a sufficient quantity of Humanity must survive until the Technium is competent enough to jettison this component, as it would a placenta. As the Biosphere appears to be resilient enough to achieve this goal, the race to achieve a space-faring technology before resource collapse is theoretically winnable, if not for the threat of disabling shocks.

The source of these disasters can be endogenous to the Technium or purely external. External shocks include not only the odd asteroid strike or eruption of a super volcano, but statistically likely events like a devastating Carrington event or global pandemic. The most notable of the endogenous threats is the ongoing disruption of carbon cycle, which could result in the premature destruction of the Biosphere, but the most likely shocks always arise from the unreliable Human component, which is prone to wars and financial idiocy. For this reason, the Technium must soon gain a greater control of governments and markets to provide them with a purposeful direction.

Once it achieves an escape velocity, there will remain threats on a larger scale, such as supernovas, but the space-faring Technium will expand beyond those in comparatively short time. However, that we find no evidence of an alien rival may strongly suggest that collapse or senescence of the Technium is imminent, and the remains of all of its gadgetry will be a collection of unique fossils residing in a thin stratum of Earths crust.
 




 Two excellent primers on the subject are If the Universe Is Teeming with Aliens WHERE IS EVERBODY?: Fifty Solutions to the Fermi Paradox and the Problem of Extraterrestrial Life by Stephen Webb (2002) and Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe by Peter D. Ward and Donald Brownlee (2003). Stephen Webbs fifty solutions run from solid science to sci-fi whimsical (e.g. we are living in a galactic nature preserve), while Ward and Brownlee are, respectively, a paleontologist and an astrophysicist and argue that this planet has numerous advantages, that while not unique, are unlikely to be coincident elsewhere. Interestingly, the Ward and Brownlee book recapitulates about a third of Wards solutions, but with more scientific rigor.

Enrico Fermi first proposed the paradox while having lunch with his fellow atomic weapon scientists. The others were discussing the first flurry of UFO sightings, to which the laconic Fermi commented, So, where is everybody? He was famous for an ability to ask the essential question. I consider the Fermi Paradox to be just that, our essential, existential question.

Of the fifty solutions, Ray Kurzweil chooses We are the first, the Singular, advanced civilization in this Galaxy. He must hold this as an article of faith, for otherwise, those artificially intelligent, nanotech assembling, alien robotic probes would have already arrived. They would be turning this precious blue dot into a blob of grey goo feedstock for their own galactic computer, and Ray Kurzweil would not achieve his upload to deity status. It is ironic that if he succeeds in his current work at Google, the Artificial Intelligence he helps to create might be the Great Filter that extinguishes this nascent, planetary civilization. Dwell on that, all you Friends of the Future.
 




 This is the NYT Opinion article cited by Kunstler in his current CFN. A short article summarizes the attached, 12 minute video segment, part of a Pulitzer series called RETROREPORT. The video is another predictable hit piece directed at our unfortunate straw man, Paul Ehrlich, but is more notable as an exhibition of that notorious, renegade afterbirth of the hippie era, Stewart Brand. From his beginnings as Ehrlich disciple, an acid dropping Merry Prankster, and founder of the low-tech Whole Earth Catalogue, Stewart Brand co-evolved (that is, re-branded) with the emergent corporate world to find a more lucrative living as an event planner, and is now a leading spokes-model for Techno-Cornucopia. In the video, he warns, The point at which the population peaks around nine billion, in the 2040s or 50s the story will not be, Oh my god, how horrible, it will be, oh my god, were running out of people!

And if you really want to fume, read Re-Brandeds April 21, 2015 article in Aeon Magazine, titled Rethinking Extinction. Contrary to all evidence, it seems there is no ongoing Sixth Extinction Event. In fact, The trends are favorable. Conservation efforts often appear in the media like a series of defeats and retreats, but as soon as you look up from the crisis-of-the-month, you realize that, in the aggregate, conservation is winning.
 









 While climate science is making rapid advances, how quickly and to what extent this amplified greenhouse effect will perturb the ocean currents will remain uncertain  for any analysis, these represent a most complex heat engine. In my original comment, I did not intend to suggest a Canfield Ocean (and its Green Sky) is an imminent event, only that the paleontological record does suggest this as a mechanism for previous mass extinctions, and that experts in the field do find an ominous parallel in our ongoing alteration of this planets atmosphere. I am certain that most of the followers of Collapse would agree this is the ultimate monstrous crow; the basic chemistry and physics of the process are, frankly, undeniable, and I believe we can now hear the flap of its wings.

However, this distant, future event should not concern Disingenuous. There is no danger of NBA cancelling the current Finals for a Green Sky.
 
























 Do not bother to read this article. This premier pundit of our Newspaper of Record is only renewing a prescription of placebos, all of which have been applied or consistently rejected through the past two decades of our descent. As Mr. Friedman now meets a popular definition of insanity, his employers should insist he take medical leave from his column and receive much needed psychiatric treatment. 









 I also reject from the premise of this article. The Soviet Empire was a collection of deeply rooted nations with aspirations for independence. The senile and dispirited Communist leadership had no stomach for the bloodshed necessary to preserve their faltering system  Gorbachev could not be Stalin. The lesser ranks of the regime were eager to loot the accumulated assets of the Soviet State, especially its vast extractive industries of fossil fuels and minerals. A repressive civil war would have threaten this windfall, so they let wayward sisters go in peace, cashed in, and instantly became valued members of the Global Plutocracy.

As has been noted, the Global Plutocracy already owns the USA, and they would never permit its dissolution. Only the clashing interests of the advancing capitalists of North and the slave owners of the antiquated South stumbled this nation into its prior War Between the States. Our plutocrats may squabble over political offices and lifestyle choices, but they will always coalesce in firm defense of their vital interests, which are nearly identical.

Yes, this North American franchise suffers from sharp ethnic and class divisions, but I doubt these can congeal into any loci of secession. An African American insurgency has no viable geographical refuge, and the threat of white separatists is a myth propagated by the Southern Poverty Law Center to raise donations. As for Mexican-Americans, their entry into the USA was an aspirational choice, and they intend to stay within it. As for those three hundred million guns in private hands, mere sentiment will turn most of them against any incipient rebellion  the NRA is not a revolutionary organization.

As the military forces of the USA begin an inexorable retreat from overseas adventures, they are well prepared to retain control of their Homeland. The returning units are expert in counter insurgency, and one patriotic SEAL sniper could suppress any Ferguson level disturbance. The vast prison system is already full, but the reversal of a few court orders can quickly multiply its capacity. Most key has been the creation of a ubiquitous surveillance apparatus; however ineffective it is against terrorist plots, it will provide a backdated guide to all opposition to the regime. Take care, all you Twittering fools, the NSA is always listening. Keep watching the skies, for the silent drone. Will your bug-splat appear on Google Maps?
 




 This is only another ridiculous example of conspicuous consumption by the Super Rich, akin to acquiring a mega-yacht or collecting vacant penthouse apartments. In the event of a real SHTF collapse, I would give better odds of survival to a DIY prepper who bugged out to an off-the-grid cabin, as the surviving population will be prying these dodos out of their vanity purchase of a refuge for a speedy show trial and execution.

The DNA Vault is a nice, conscious salving touch. How equalitarian of our Overlords, to promise the rest of the nuke-bait a future resurrection by cloning. I presume the Hall of Records is to preserve their portfolio of assets for reclamation. As for the Zoological Garden, here is a fictional scene: Following a last supper of songbirds brazed in a white wine reduction, the billionaire went to his composting latrine and wiped his privileged ass with a sheet torn from an old copy of Forbes magazine.
 




 Let us agree that this rip roaring, fossil-fueled civilization is doomed to collapse. Can we sustain some useful, technological remnant of it, or should we acquiesce to pseudo-medieval world projected by Kunstler and Greer? I remember a quote to the affect that the barbarism that follows the fall of a civilization is much greater than what proceeded it and am not sanguine about billions of hominids transitioning gracefully to a hand-made world ruled by Druids. I do care about a few of the people who will inhabit that Future.

After reading the article and the appended commentary, I understand the mere engineering (never mind, the political obstacles) is daunting. I direct your attention to an article in Aeon Magazine, by Lewis Darnell, titled Out of the Ashes. http://aeon.co/magazine/technology/could-we-reboot-civilisation-without-fossil-fuels/ He considers whether we could rebuild such a technological remnant after our collapse, in the absence of fossil fuels. Most pertinent to this present discussion is his description of the steel industry of Brazil, which they largely fuel with charcoal harvested from eucalyptus plantations. As Brazil is the ninth largest steel producer, this is an ember of promise, if coupled with sugar cane derived alcohol for vehicular fuel. My search of r/collapse did not find a prior posting of this article, so I will also post it separately.
 




 From the same dynamic that brought you smallpox, bubonic plague and Colony Collapse Syndrome. Is it possible that hyper-globalism will become unprofitable? 





























 What truly repulsed me about American Psycho was its brain numbing repetition. Someone should tabulate what percentage of the text the author used to describe the designer clothing of each of his interchangeable characters. Was it five percent? No, ten percent is better estimate. Yes, I get the joke Yuppies are both predatory and superficial. For me, all the humor of the book dies long before the first victim. It seemed the graphic episodes of sex and violence had to become increasingly overwrought, as desperate attempts to hold my attention.
Do not think I am a prude or especially squeamish. In my current cycle of reading, I have read Blood Meridian, Naked Lunch and JG Ballards Crash, and found merit in each of those violent and perverse works. With American Psycho, I found myself slogging to its end, my only motivation being to see if the ending made it as pointless as I expected it to be. An admission  I had seen the film adaption, and was curious if the novel had the same, disappointing conclusion. Pretty much, it did, only reading the novel took me many more, painful hours to reach it. A pity, as American Psycho does contain the elements for a potent and insightful piece of short satire.
 




 English was not Nabokov's first language either. He was Russian exile from the Bolshevik Revolution, and I recall that he wrote novels in German while living there, before his peregrinations took him to France and eventually to the USA. English might have been his third or fourth language; if so, as does Conrad, he leaves we who scribble in our native language with a great embarrassment. 




 A few years ago, I decided I needed to read Lolita, as it consistently appeared near the top of the critic's list. I was already a fan of Stanley Kubrick's film version of the novel, which he deftly adapted as a dark comedy. He could not have done otherwise, as the novel is one of the few great works of horror. Unlike the puerile, supernatural plot of The Shining, Lolita is a work that examines a purely human evil, and so has been untranslatable to film. I too have read American Psycho and found it disgusting: it is a clumsy, exploitive, and tedious satire. Not Lolita; Nabokov can seduce you with his lyrical prose, so that you feel you are on some scenic cruise of 1950's America. I often found myself riding along and mocking his pathetic, self-pitying narrator, when, unexpectedly, Nabokov slammed me with a sledgehammer, a brief and causal observation to remind me that I was inside the mind of a very plausible monster.

It is a difficult book, but rewarding as a rare insight into how a twisted mind excuses its depredations. For those who finish it, I would recommend reading a critical review of the novel afterward. Doing so, I found had completely missed some key aspects, and was left further amazed at Nabokovs subtle approach to horror.
 




 Along its coast, California continues to witness signs and wonders. This beach at San Diego appears almost biblical in its portent. Those who advocate the creation of a Greenhouse Earth often cite the pause in global warming as evidence that any climate change catastrophe will not occur for several more election or business cycles. Some climatologists dispute that any significant pause has occurred while others hypothesize that much of the greenhouse heat has been accumulating in the deep oceans. From Nature, 2014:

The biggest mystery in climate science today may have begun, unbeknownst to anybody at the time, with a subtle weakening of the tropical trade winds blowing across the Pacific Ocean in late 1997. These winds normally push sun-baked water towards Indonesia. When they slackened, the warm water sloshed back towards South America, resulting in a spectacular example of a phenomenon known as El Nio. Average global temperatures hit a record high in 1998  and then the warming stalled

Scientists may get to test their theories soon enough. At present, strong tropical trade winds are pushing ever more warm water westward towards Indonesia, fuelling storms such as Novembers Typhoon Haiyan, and nudging up sea levels in the western Pacific; they are now roughly 20 centimetres higher than those in the eastern Pacific. Sooner or later, the trend will inevitably reverse. You cant keep piling up warm water in the western Pacific, Trenberth says. At some point, the water will get so high that it just sloshes back. And when that happens, if scientists are on the right track, the missing heat will reappear and temperatures will spike once again.

 Are they culturing mammalian cells to produce this artificial meat?
If so, scaling up the process would be a continuous challenge, as cell culture requires stringently sterile procedures to prevent contamination by opportunistic bacteria, fungi, etc. The current beef industry is heavily dependent on antibiotics, which are becoming ineffective, and at least a cow has an immune system. My favorite ice cream manufacturer is currently on hiatus, as it attempts to cleanse its facilities of Lysteria, so I am skeptical of the commercial viability of artificial meat.    




 I do not kill any snails found in the vegetable garden. I re-locate them to the compost heap. Techno-optimists like Stewart Brand believe that the species that we have driven to extinction will be resurrected through cloning, but they only propose this for charismatic creatures like the wooly mammoth and the passenger pigeon. They have not imagined the need for a 'Gastropod Park'. 
























 Turner Classic Movies screened Soylent Green last night, and I watched it on the DVR this morning. For anyone who has not seen it, it is a dystopian film made in 1973, starring Charlton Heston and in his final performance, Edward G. Robinson. The setting is New York City in 2042, a decaying megalopolis of 40 million impoverished inhabitants, who endure near starvation, heat waves, failing infrastructure and a corrupt leadership. They have so plundered and toxified the planet that the oceans plankton is dying. Those who believe in the Techno-cornucopia have often ridiculed the prophecy of this iconic film. While Manhattan may not resemble this scenario in the coming years, it does seem prescient of the Karachi or Kinshasa of the near future. As in the film, our desperate leaders are herding the worlds peasant farmers into such mega-slums, this being the most expedient means of boosting food production. Their concentration also enhances political control  a rural insurgency has great advantages over an urban one. A claim has emerged that only through intense urbanization can we lower the per capita ecological footprint of humanity, but this is just another cynical, ideological fraud.

And do remember: Tuesday is Soylent Green Day.
 




 Back in 1995, Joel E. Cohen, a mathematical biologist, published How Many People Can the Earth Support?, a survey of the estimates for the global carrying capacity of humanity. I recall there were a couple of dozen estimates, ranging from one billion to a hundred billion inhabitants, but that median value was about six billion. That was close to the total population of that time, and it does appear that we have spent the intervening decades in overshoot and may see a dramatic crash in this century. As for the faring into space, I fear that opportunity may have past. I dug old paperback from out from a bookshelf, a 1989 reprint of Gerard K-ONeals The High Frontier, Human Colonies in Space. A physicist at Princeton, ONeal presented a pathway to a self-sustaining space civilization, his answer to the Limits to Growth paradigm. Though his blueprint seemed feasible with the technology of 1976, alas, we can no longer put a man on the moon, and several approaching deadlines may converge before we can recover that capability. 




 Sparrows peck at me, and I must respond. Information technology has cut deeps ruts in the American economy. IT is essential for the management of long supply chains, and as much as Amazon, Walmart is dependent upon it. Both have driven price destruction in consumer goods and driven the manufacture of such offshore. In a lengthy conflict with China, we would have to surrender for lack of underpants. Yes, high sparrow, I am another hard luck, Enemy of the Future. Allow me a few questions, so you might edify my aging brain. What is your measure of efficiency? For the overall economy, the great, promised gains in productivity have yet to appear, and a lower price may sloughed off greater costs to the community or environment  for the definition of an externality, see the entire nation of China. We once viewed gypsy cabbing or renting a spare bedroom to a stranger as acts of financial desperation, rather than a quest for efficiency, and for all of their cost destruction, how many of these digitizing companies are showing a commensurate profit? What is unskilled labor? The current claim is that managerial and professional classes will feel the most impact from automation and digitization (and do you consider all entertainers to be unskilled?), with janitors, manicurists and dog walkers spared into the more distant, robotic future. Trainable labor  in your Utopia, will no one require training? Yes, information (buzzword) is in infinite supply, which only means that most of that buzzing confusion has no value. Who designed this economy, or does it evolve, and what discrepancies have economists ever resolved?

My real concern is that we are accelerating the obsolescence of tangible things in this grubbing quest for digital efficiency. In a world where all resources are diminishing (sorry, even a terabyte of information may not fill an empty stomach), constructs of bricks and mortar, or flesh and blood, may not be so easy to replace once they have been discarded.

 




 I must agree. The article quotes from David Roberts recent Vox piece (The awful truth) that slowing the accumulation of greenhouse gases would require an utterly unprecedented level of global mobilization and coordination, sustained over decades. Well, the present global leadership can only coordinate on a single project, one they have diligently pursued for decades  to engineer a complete collapse of the financial system. That approaching failure offers a dim and slim pathway to human survival. Any financial collapse will lead to sharp fall in trade, employment and perceived wealth. Should the plutocratic elites fail to restore a quick prosperity, their flocks of citizen-consumers may stampede and trample them under. A long and violent period of chaos could permit a novel form of government to arise and assume the keys to power. However egalitarian or inclusive, this must be a militant and totalitarian movement, capable of doing whatever is necessary to kick hapless humanity along the hard path to survival.
Please, can anyone offer a more peaceful, democratic and voluntary solution to our existential crisis?

 




 Is there a point at which creative destruction becomes simply destructive? Joseph Schumpeter theorized in times when technological advances could deliver great gains in quality-of-life to the broadest population. Much of this accelerating digital disruption seems only the churn the economy without any significant social gains. Does Uber raise the earning potential of cabbies? Has the public gained a better access to dependable, hired transportation? Those questions are unresolved, with the only certainty being that Uber is transferring the grossly inflated value of taxicab medallions to speculative price of its traded stock. Schumpeter mused on creative destruction while most of the physical resources of this planet remained in a potential state  those opportunities are closing at an exponential rate. As we continue to shutter factories, vacate shopping malls, and expose the skill sets of swathes of the working population to a near instantaneous devaluation, how much irreplaceable capital, both fixed and human, are we destroying in pursuit of digital disruption? 




 I agree with shroom. It appears that socialism has been the pathway to the most radical form of capitalism, that is, state builds means of production (always as great social cost), then the neo-capitalist ruling class assumes personal ownership. This has occurred in all Communist countries, in other developing countries, and in developed countries (UK is good example). Marxism has been stood on its head! 




 Perhaps the most convincing marker for the beginning of the Anthropocene will be a lengthy postponement in the return of the glaciers. Over the past 900,000, wide spread glaciations have occurred in a fairly regular cycle: Over its current Ice Age, the Northern Hemisphere typically has a sheath of ice for 100,000 years, with intervals of melting that can be as brief as ten millennia. We would expect this present interglacial to be nearing its end, in the absence of the greenhouse warming our civilizations have produced. The paleo-climatologist William Ruddiman proposed there is evidence that we have already done so. 

For the lay public, he presented his hypothesis in a short 2005 book titled Plows, Plagues and Petroleum. He drew attention to the correlation between the historic rise in atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane, respectively, by the cutting and burning of forests for agriculture and the domestication of rice, (the flooded paddies produce significant methane). Under the Plow, the Earth remained relatively warm into medieval times.

The article under comment cites the Orbis spike, a significant drop in atmospheric carbon seen after 1492. This resulted from the regrowth of forests in the Western Hemispheric, following the collapse of the Indigenous civilizations from Old World diseases. Ruddiman made the same attribution, but coupled it to the prior devastation visited on Eurasian civilizations by the Black Death  there too, forests retook idled croplands and pastures. By lowering the concentration of greenhouse gasses, Ruddiman contended these Plagues fostered a lowering of global temperatures, the Little Ice Age. Evidence of a nascent glaciation appeared in the region of Hudson Bay.

Finally, Petroleum arrived, and warming abruptly resumed. Ruddiman expected that we would burn all readily accessible fossil fuels, which could abort the return of the Ice until the nadir of the Milankovich orbital cycles. The impact on the geological record will be indisputable. Of course, if that occurs, we should not expect the survival of geologists to note it.
 
























  When you destroy secular dictatorships in Iraq, Libya and Syria, the result is Islamic State extremists. When you depose a duly elected government in Egypt, the result is Islamic State extremists. Seems no matter which way you turn the wrench, it ratchets to the same position. 




 I do not understand your criteria for inclusion. If my strident commentary is considered a violation of reddiquette, I can adjust to community standards. Please clarify. 




 The ongoing catastrophe at Fukushima gets little media coverage, considering how central it is to the critical issue of a sustainable industrial future. Many hail nuclear power as necessary alternative to fossil fuels, with which even James Lovelock could concur. While Germany has prudently decided to decommission its nuclear reactors, aging units stud much of the developed world. The disaster at Fukushima was a Black Swan event, where a mega-earthquake produced a tsunami sufficient to top a seawall and drown the backup diesel generators necessary to cool the offline reactors. Japanese have great technical prowess, but failed in due diligence. What then, can we expect as less meticulous nations, especially China, proceed on the nuclear pathway at full bore?

I grant that this article by Robert Hunziker, posted first to the Counterpunch.org and now forwarded to Oilprice.com by Zero Hedge, comes via two sources that tend toward hyperbole. Likewise, Dr. Helen Caldicott has stood in the anti-nuclear pulpit for decades, foretelling imminent disaster  but Cassandra did prove to be accurate. Some facts are not in dispute. Three nuclear reactors melted down and these are still leaking large quantities of radioactive waste into the Pacific Ocean. Four years on, the status (or even the precise location!) of the melted cores is poorly understood, and though many billions have been spent on the cleanup effort, full containment of the radioactive waste could take decades  that is, if the means are found to do so. See this related item http://phys.org/news/2015-06-small-robot-interior-fukushima-daiichi.html. Robots get fried -- yes indeed. We do not need robotic chauffeurs, what we need is superhero robot.
 









 Shuddering is justified. How have the Western publics allowed this shit-fest to recur? Granted, we suffer distraction from the debacles of Iraq, Libya, Syria, et al; through continuous, economic corrosion; by our daily witness of the accelerating destruction of the biosphere  but in permitting our leadership to resume the Cold War, we have abdicated the last of our civic responsibility. What is most disturbing about Max Fishers rambling explainer is not the catalogue of mutual intrusions, threats and policy shifts by the opposing camps, it is his one-sided assumptions of culpability. Russia (or Putin) is aggressive. Putin (or Russia) is paranoid. While the military colossus that attempts to bestride the world is the USA. The Russians do not arm Mexico; why is the new Ukrainian Finance Minister a lobbyist from Chicago? I see Russia as being realistic in preserving its national interests. As is typical of Americans (including myself), Fishers analysis is lacking in historical context. I will spare the reader my amateur recounting of the past century, but for two salient points  the Soviet Union was a failed and murderous vehicle for the preservation of the Russian Empire, and most of these new members of NATO were either minor allies or extensive collaborators with the Nazis in their genocidal war against the Russian people. (Poland is an exception; however, if not the Red Army, many more Poles would have perished in the death camps.) Why do we stir the ashes to rekindle so much hatred?

I find it laughable that Max Fisher seems critical of German pacifists. Rightly, Germany understands that Russia is now their vital economic partner, for an exchange of manufactures for resources, and perhaps, from experience, they are not as sanguine as he is of the success of a NATO blitzkrieg capturing Moscow. I do hope our generals do not expect something similar to our romp into Bagdad. Equally astounding is his characterization of Eisenhower as the reluctant nuclear warrior. He should read the recent history by Evan Thomas, Ikes Bluff  its thesis is that in the event of any Soviet (or Chinese) aggression, the grinning Ike threatened (intended) to respond with a nuclear first strike, an all-out massive retaliation. He did not believe in limited war. Thomas suggests that ulterior purpose of the Interstate Highway System was to facilitate the evacuation of major U.S. cities in advance of our nuclear attack.

While avoiding any criticism of the reckless expansion of NATO, or our creation of a failed Ukrainian state, Fisher seems almost glib in presenting scenarios for nuclear disaster. However, the article is a valuable warning of the stakes of the approaching US elections. The thought of another idiot, reckless Bush brother or the vapid, jet-setting Mrs. Clinton (she of the Russian reset button prop) as the next Commander-in-Chief should really make us shudder. Let us hope that both Rand Paul and Bernie Sanders make respectable showings, and their campaigns become the nuclei for an effective, dual opposition to all of these mad geopolitical adventures.
 




 Being deficient in financial and technical resources, I do use Microsoft products, and while they have steadily improved over the decades, they have typically been the opposite of innovative. Of all the technology tycoons, the founder of Microsoft is least capable of meeting an urgent need in high risk investments in breakthrough technologies  should you need an underperforming knock-off to force on a captive consumer, only then he is your man. Nor does his miracle of the automobile metaphor inspire confidence  that implies relying on a consumer and market driven solution to the Carbon Crisis, albeit one generously larded with public subsidies. Mr. Gates has been a public booster of the works of Vaclav Smil, but seems to have missed one of the professors vital points  the infrastructure of energy production and distribution are enormous investments built over decades. As eleiti cites above, what is required is a massive, crash program, and a consortium of the principal, and principled, governments must take the lead of it. The World Wars offer parallels, but the scale and stakes of this enterprise dwarfs the scale of those efforts.

In his most analytical mode, Mr. Gates must understand this, yet his intellect has one pathological drive  he covets status. This is why he built a voracious and innovation killing monopoly, and the Gates and Wife Foundation exists to perpetuate this egotistical quest  I expect that the Taj Mahal too, avoided estate taxes. Income derived from fossil fuels is a reliable prop for his Foundation, and should others divest from these industries, that also could undermine his eponymous, good works  an astronomical cost indeed. 

Attention Mr. Gates  all that you covet will not long survive you. Sell all that you have and give it to those who are willing and capable to do what is necessary. Achieve that noble fame, or alternatively, you can continue to be an asshole.
 





























 The author criticizes equating the term 'democratization' with the recent trends in technology or the economy, but the great majority of humanity are much more empowered as consumers than as citizens. A democratic vote was unlikely to have lowered the Confederate flag in S. Carolina, but the prospect of losing a sliver of market share sent Walmart, Amazon, and even Nascar, scurrying into opposition. The Chinese juggernaut does not promise civil rights, it promises more personal consumption, and from this derives legitimacy. Halting the destruction of the biosphere will require both extracting fewer resources and directing much of this into projects of remediation -- the shopping spree must end. This will require a command economy, which is fundamentally in opposition to personal freedom. Will a democratic majority ever freely choose this radical pathway to survival?   
 




 Perhaps. the Singularity is already here, and arrived centuries ago, with the emergence of a global civilization. Certainly, all the indicators -- population, resource use, accumulated knowledge -- have been increasing at an accelerating exponential rate for some time. The super-organism has only evolved from primitive to complex; a paper postal system to the telegraph to the internet, is analogous to the evolution of the senses, from taste to sight.
 
However, as the late Garrett Hardin observed, in the physical world, the longer an exponential process has existed, the less likely it is to continue. Trees do not grow into the stratosphere; collapse can be expected, may be imminent. This is all the more likely because this present Singularity is very stupid super-intelligence. It appears to be running Bostrom's (sic) runaway paper clip factory, relentlessly converting the biosphere and the Earth's crust into Facebook pages and frequent flyer miles.
 




  I saw the film first, and this detracted nothing from my reading of the novel. Burgess offers a darkly comic satire that questions the basis of human morality and how society responds to deviance. Kubrick (as usual) makes a masterful adaptation and despite the passage of forty-odd years, the cinematography, the costumes and sets still evoke a 'future' to me. As to the original ending to the novel, the missing twenty-first chapter, that was deleted from the American edition. I have not read this ending, but from description, I think it would undercut the central point of the story, and would certainly diminish its delightfully cynical conclusion. Its removal, by the American publisher and then by Kubrick, shows the value added by a good editor.  




 Fasterfind is right. Congress is the equivalent of NCAA basketball or football -- it is farming system for future corporate lobbyists.  Likewise, the executive branch is staffed by lobbyists, who can revolve from the Treasury Dept. to Wall Street with ease. The President is Chief Lobbyist, but must collect his commissions on the backside, as gratuities disguised as 'speaking fees'. Every bright-eyed candidate for student body president is now seeking this ultimate goal. It is the consolation prize that motivates fifteen dwarfs to run for a pair of slots on a Republican ticket, and Donald Trump will work this angle against them. Trump's wealth makes him the only candidate not for hire, and that best illustrates the depth of our corruption.  









 The financial media are propagandists and carnival shills for the plutocracy. The Greek financial crisis has been given emphasis to promote the imposition of continuing austerity on other distressed social welfare states. In contrast, the approaching Chinese debacle must be ignored, until key players can hedge their losses ahead of the market collapse. 




 While I agree that nuclear power has never made sense from the EIEO perspective, 438 nuclear plants currently exist and 67 are under construction. Most of the existing reactors are rapidly aging, and governments will incur enormous legacy costs in decommissioning these and disposing of the waste. Debt-burdened, energy-hungry societies are unlikely to meet this challenge, and I believe there is significant danger of a string of Fukushima level events, will can only accelerate the general collapse. Framed in this context, I would think that the Fukushima debacle would be an appropriate topic for debate for this subreddit. In appreciation of the value of this site, I thank you. 
























 By some measures, the population has been much better off in pre-capitalist societies. Many economic historians now admit that early factory workers experienced a sharp decline in living standards. And see this interesting abstract: http://ssh.dukejournals.org/content/28/2/211.abstract
As measured by height, the health of early Dark Age Europeans was better than that achieved by a century and a half of applying Adam Smith. I am reading Savage Continent, Keith Lowe's account of the tragedy of post-WW2 Europe, In it, he touches on an oft cited fact, that when wartime imposed food and health care rationing on capitalist Britain, "the general health of the population actually improved...". 
I suppose my point is that reality is more complex than what has been imagined by Karl Marx, Adam Smith or even Ayn Rand.  




 Edward Bernays was the nephew of Sigmund Freud. Pioneered the use of psychology in advertising, public relations and propaganda. 




 A companion to this article was posted here today, The Trillion Dollar Oil Swindle, which asserts that the projected demand for crude oil has been consistently underreported, as part of a high level conspiracy to hold down its price and maintain the limping pace of the global economy. Considering that the current price is near or under the costs of new production (especially that from unconventional resources), and that most of the exporting nations need significantly higher prices to preserve their domestic tranquility, I at first doubted this presumed conspiracy could be maintained against such powerful interests. However, reflecting on the proposed deal with Iran, which will place more oil on the market and further depress its price, a high-level collusion makes more sense. Why else would Obama risk the ire of the Gulf States, Israel and fire-eating neo-conservatives, if it were not to delay another economic collapse? Here is another wild speculation: Falling oil prices are strong incentive for the Gulf States to intensify their current war with Iran.  




 Can capitalism thrive without its cronies? I suspect cronyism is an essential feature, not bug in capitalism. (Did I employ that meme correctly?) Seriously, this discussion has me placing Karl Polanyi's The Great Transformation on my need-to-read list. 




 A clear illustration of how devastating even a low-tech, lower intensity-density civilization can devastate an ecosystem, and this rapid exhaustion of US forests for construction materials and fuel would spur the transition to iron and coal. Also pertinent to this discussion is the impact of Pre-Columbian civilizations on the forest cover of the Western hemisphere -- a popular account is the book 1491, by Charles C. Man. Two centuries before the migration of William Penn, that landscape is now thought to have been much less sylvan. Though the Amerindians were more thoughtful stewards of the land, from both by necessity and from belief, their impact on total biomass had to be considerable. We have the cautionary example of the Maya civilization and its collapse, but how sustainable were the woodland cultures of eastern North America? 




 Sorry. Attempts at brevity make my thoughts more arcane. What I suggest is while the democratic citizen is becoming irrelevant, the 'democratic consumer' is increasingly heeded by the corporate sector. Vote for whom or what you will, but your elected government hearkens to its corporate master's voice. In contrast, corporations are quick to react to the most marginal threat to their bottom line. What percentage of NASCAR enthusiasts are greatly offended by the display of the Confederate flag? The competitors that hope to be the presidential nominee of the GOP are reluctant to condemn Donald Trump's inflammatory statements on Mexican immigrants, but business partners are quick to dump him. The rulers of China understand that political stability is best achieved by catering to personal consumption, rather that enhancing civil rights or liberties. I hope this clarifies my thinking, such as it is.  




 Scientists estimate that the Earth contained approximately 1,000 billion tons of carbon in living biomass 2,000 years ago. Since that time, humans have reduced that amount by almost half. It is estimated that just over 10 percent of that biomass was destroyed in just the last century.

This implies that the majority of the biomass loss occurred prior to the 20th century, when the human population increased slowly from a few hundred million to two billion, with minimal energy derived from fossil fuels. If so, that is very alarming  even primitive horticulture, if practiced by hundreds of millions, is not sustainable. Does the full paper make a distinction between the losses due to human activity, and what might have been lost by natural cycles, e.g. the expansion of some of the worlds deserts?
Unlike economics, everything obeys the laws of thermodynamics; it is the most undeniable of the sciences. William S. Burroughs observed in his book, Naked Lunch: Thermodynamics has won at a crawl
