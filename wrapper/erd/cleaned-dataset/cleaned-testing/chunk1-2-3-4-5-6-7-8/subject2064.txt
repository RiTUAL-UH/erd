 Silly SoSo, Leanns amish. She doesnt know what a walmart is, lol. 




 I know right. We all love to hate Penn, but after this season, damn that girl is messed up! I used to think Morello was one of the normal ones, but we learn last season just how crazy she is. 




 Everything about this makes my jaw drop. You are..... Wow! 




 I think it was just supposed to be playful. 




 I like how SoSo goes from being an annoying character, to one of the most sympathized characters on the show. 




 "You were so hot before you were a cunt." 




 Wow, you're hot! I love your hips :) 




 Shes a camgirl. Her name is Rileyster. She can be found on several sites. Links to them can be found on her tumblog. rileyster.tumblr.com 




 Same here. I know everyone loves Tyrion and Bron, but personally I prefer Tyrion and Varys.
 




 Thank you! I could not have put it better myself! 
























 Simply... perfection  




 Not sure who she is, but that picture has been around for a long time. She may be a nobody. 




 Not an exact match, but similar features.

 You are unbelievably sexy! Every pic made my jaw drop ;) 




 Wow! I love your outfit :) 
























 You look super cute in (and out of) that dress :) 




 Good lord indeed! 




 Now keep in mind, I don't know any Japanese. I know I can just go to Google, but I want to check with a native speaker because its for a tattoo. Basically, its a series of tattoos based on movies and games that, growing up, captivated and inspired my imagination. Simply I want to get the words "Never Stop Dreaming," in Hylian, and the era of [Hylian](https://i.imgur.com/Z05eact.jpg) I want to use is based off of Japanese.  So if anybody can translate it for me, and also transliterate it to the Latin alphabet. As is my key. I would be eternally grateful.  




 [This](http://imgur.com/Z05eact) is the reference chart I went by
 




 Whichever one proposes first. 









 Im in love with your smile :) 




 You are very welcome indeed :) 




 I want you so bad right now! 




 I need to go hiking 
























 OMG! You are literally the cutest thing ever! 3 Whats your ring size? 




 lol, yeah.. 




 I'm sure everyone here will be saying the same thing, but fuck those people! Like what you like, and don't be ashamed of it. If you lose friends because of the music you listen to, then they aren't the kind of friends you want to keep around. OR, they may respect you for being unashamed of it, and like you more. It may even open their eyes to the genre. "Well, they like EDM, and they're cool, so maybe EDMs not so bad." Or, and this isn't recommended, but if you wanna be more passive with it, just play it off as a joke. If they catch you listening to electronic music and laugh at you, just be in on the joke. They'll laugh, you'll laugh, and you all have a good time. The best way to deal with a bully is to laugh with them, as opposed to letting them laugh at you. 




 You look amazing 




 Sexy doesn't even begin to describe you 




 Itd be a crime to not post it :) 




 You totally do. The question is, which Alex are you going as? Prison Alex? Orange or Khaki? Rockabilly Alex? etc. 




 I downloaded one of my favorite DJs sets from (I think EDC last year) and he opened with "they call me (his name)" and it made me cringe, cause that's just such a douchey thing to say. I love his music, but sometimes he just says douchey things. 




 The greatest song in the world. Duh... 




 I'd love to taste your frosting ;) 
























 Being the object of desire. 




 Peggle 




 Plants vs Zombies 




 When discussing religion with someone, and being told I was going to hell for being an atheist, the person followed up with "I wish I didn't believe that." 




 Depends if said ex boyfriend still has feelings for said girl.  




 I personally would never think negatively about it. Hell, if anything, it'd be a turn on for me. All these guys wanting a girl, and I'm the only one who has a chance with her. 




 God bless America!!! 




 You couldn't pay me to blow that off. 




 Guardians of the Galaxy 




 I know the djs name. I didn't wanna just call him out for saying douchey things sometimes, lol. 
























 I would take you out anywhere your heart desires 3 




 Apparently, in the future, global warming has clearly flipped the earths seasons on it's head. What we used to know as wintry Christmas time, is now the prime season for a tropical vacation, full of beach parties and sunbathing. I wonder if they still have presents. 




 Omg, you are too cute. I love your makeup, I love your hair, I love your socks. You are precious  




 I know a person who will be looking for a roommate come August or September. Who loves reading, Netflix, knitting, and art; and who's boyfriend loves tabletop gaming, lol. House will be with two other people in their mid-late 20s, 1 male, and 1 female. You will have your own room, and possibly your own bathroom. How do you feel about dogs? 




 Now that deserves a salute 




 Oh, haha. Well, regardless, you're still the cutest thing ever :) 




 You should check out a game called Hero Academy 




 Yes, yes they do ;) 




 If I was attracted to them, and we had chemistry, yes. 




 Parks and Recreation 
























 Because using blankets would take away the integrity of it being a pillow fort. As soon as they used blankets, it would no longer be a pillow fort, it would be a blanket and pillow fort, and thats not what they set out to do. Abed was just keeping with their original objective.

 Ok, say Artist C releases a track featuring the vocals of Artist E, and Artist D plays that track at a live show; and that live show is broadcast over satellite radio, and also made available for download later. How does that work? 




 Running [Windows 7](http://imgur.com/gDygYT2), using Adobe Media Encoder. Whenever I bring in an AfterEffects composition and render out a Quicktime file using the H.264 codec at 720p, it works fine. The problem is occurring when I try to render it out at 1080p. The render fails as soon as it starts, and the Error Log simply says "Error compiling movie. Unknown error." Why is this happening, and what can I do to fix it? 




 You know if your IT guy does see this, you have to tell us what happens :) 




 Ok, am I the only one who's tired of girls like this "oh, i'm curious whether or not I look good." Girl, please, you know you look amazing! Don't act like you don't know that your eyes are impossibly stunning, or your face isn't unbelievably beautiful, and don't even get me started on that smile, casue I honestly, can't even find the words. And then you top it off with a body picture, that honestly, looks like you belong in a magazine. The only negative thing I can say is that you're too perfect, but that's just being petty at this point, lol. 




 You are gorgeous. You have an infectious smile, and from what I can tell, your body looks amazing. If anything, you look even cuter post-preggo. 




 You are absolutely stunning! I love your eyes. You make me feel more beautiful just by looking at you C: 




 You don't have to tell me twice. 
























 Can a man suffering from performance anxiety be forced into having an erection? No. However, that doesn't mean that another man who doesn't suffer from performance anxiety cant become forcibly aroused, nor that that man with said condition can't later overcome his anxiety, and later be forcibly aroused. 




 Performance anxiety and what you're describing as rape, are two completely different things. There's so much more to an erection than the want to have sex. Not to mention the fact that consent isn't as easy as black and white. Also, you're assuming that male rape is when a man has penal-vaginal intercourse with a woman. 




 Were I available, I would take you in a manly fashion. 




 Welcome to Game of Thrones! 




 Nope, that's her biological brother.

 Think about it, you dance all night, and then in the morning, freshly baked muffins. 




 Not just cancerous ones. Just your regular everyday mole. They seem to just pop up out if nowhere. Where do they come from? Why do we have em? Am I gonna have to stare at this one on the inside of my pinky finger forever? 




 Because, if the record is broken while its a pillow and blanket fort, then the record they're breaking isn't for largest pillow fort, but for largest pillow and blanket fort.
