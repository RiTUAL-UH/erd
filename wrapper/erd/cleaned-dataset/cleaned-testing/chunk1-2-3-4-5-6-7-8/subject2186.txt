 I wrote a paper on zebra stripes for my intro evolution course last year.  It was difficult to find studies on zebra stripes because everyone has just gone with the explanation someone came up with in ~~1890~~ 1867.

EDIT: Looked up the date - it was 1867, not 1890. 




 I'm an undergrad and do research in an ecology lab on my university's campus.  In my ecology courses, I learned about Optimal Foraging Theory (OFT) and even did some small experiments in those courses pertaining to OFT.  In my lab the other day, some of the professors were talking during our weekly lab meeting about behavior and one said that ecologists haven't used OFT to explain behavior in decades, ehoch surprised me since most of my courses devote so much time on the topic.  The professors in my lab are always busy and are out of the lab half the time, so I figured I'd ask other ecologically inclined people here!

Are there major flaws that make OFT a bad explanation for behavior?  




 Here are a [couple](http://www.care2.com/causes/wind-farms-and-eagle-deaths-the-dilemmas-of-green-energy.html) of [articles](http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ap-impact-wind-farms-get-pass-eagle-deaths) about what /u/DonnieS1 is talking about.

I know that wind farms kill far fewer birds than other forms of energy production, but they should be held accountable if they commit the same federal offenses as the other guys.  If they aren't made to pay the fines though, I'd like to see wind farms that kill birds put money towards conservation of affected bird species (if they don't already do that). 




 I just got a friend request about 20 minutes ago from someone I didn't know, but whose name I had seen before but couldn't remember where. When I read your comment,  it dawned on me, and sure enough, this person's name appeared on my phone's caller ID when he tried to call me last week (I don't answer for names I don't recognize). That's really unnerving... 




 Taylor Swift's reaction looks eerily similar to [this](http://i.imgur.com/NMNqH.gif). 




 These headphones definitely make the vast majority of the songs I listen to sound glorious, but I've never listened to any other headphones so I can't say whether or not they're the best out there.  I would recommend them based on my experience and general stinginess though, at least until (or if) I come across another kind that I think sound better and are in the same price range. 




 I got myself the Audio Technica ATH-M50 a few months ago for about $100.  This is my first non-earbud listening apparatus and I'd definitely recommend it for anyone looking for a decent pair of headphones at a fair price, especially since I've spent $150 for Bose earbuds before.

 Dr. Ingrid Visser has [permission](http://www.orcaresearch.org/index.php/marine-mammals-regulations) to participate in these interactions according to the website of the research trust she [founded] (http://www.orcaresearch.org/index.php/research/our-team).  She's written an [autobiography] (http://www.amazon.com/Ingrid-N.-Visser/e/B003BWZFFO) and there's a BBC [documentary] (http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0147dw3) about her research style, if you're interested!  Also, here's a BBC [interview] (https://soundcloud.com/orca-research-trust/bbc-swimming-with-whales) about what it is like to swim with killer whales, the New Zealand population of killer whales in general, and Dr. Visser's feelings concerning cetacean captivity. 




 Mmmhmm. 




 Last year, as I was walking down a campus street in the afternoon, a middle-aged couple approached me.  The man began to tell me this story about how his lady has been in the university hospital, so they needed money because their car was parked in the hospital garage and was also out of gas and they haven't eaten all day and needed food.  The lady even showed me a "hospital ID bracelet" she was wearing to prove she had just left the hospital.  I knew this story was BS, because they were in the academic core of the university which is about 10 blocks from the hospital and they both looked homeless.  I told them I was a broke college student, but they wouldn't take that for an answer.  The man kept adding to his story and was getting closer to me and the woman started to move to my side and was heading behind me.  Since there were 2 of them and 1 of me and the street was unusually deserted at the time, I gave them the change in my pocket and they immediately left.  I figured it was better to give them ~$1 in change and get out of there than to stay and potentially get robbed.

 What was it? 




 Are there any particularly fun/unique experiences you've had with your dog? 









 There was speculation among anti-captivity circles that this application had much greater implications for the import of wild-caught cetaceans to the U.S.  Had it been approved, some believed that it could open the door for the capture of Alaskan killer whales that ventured into Russian waters, which would be of great interest to SeaWorld in particular, as the genetic variation within their captive population is deplorably low. 









 Are these rubber-tipped sticks?  If they're not and the guy has decent chops he could probably do some damage to the treadmill. 




 Here are the links to the papers on [blue whales](http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/280/1765/20130657) and [beaked whales](http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/9/4/20130223), respectively, sited by the article.

I'm surprised the authors of the beaked whale paper were able to get published with a sample size of two individuals, but since beaked whales are so rare, it was probably not feasible to use a larger sample size. 









 Congrats on the long term relationship! 

I've never met anyone from Ohio that is happy to be from here.  Either they already left and are glad they did or are planning to leave after whatever life milestone comes next (graduation, retirement, etc.).  The only problem is that it's like a miniature black hole of terrible that's nearly impossible to escape from. 




 I'm surprised Ohio hasn't shown up yet.  Do non-Ohioans not hate our state as much as we do?

We don't even have a real flag, we use bodies of water as directions (north is called "towards the lake" and south is called "towards the river"), and our unit for measuring time is "days until the next Ohio State University football game."  Oh yeah, and soybeans.  Soybeans.  Everywhere. 




 I was an idiot today and was playing with a power strip with a wet hand while the other was in an aquarium and I was standing in a pool of water.  I felt a buzz in my finger when I turned on the strip that I hadn't felt before when using it and realized I'd just been shocked.  That freaked me out because I could have potentially died and not even realized it. 




 I wrote the previous comment at work and guessed on the date.  In his 1867 book *Mimicry, and Other Protective Resemblances Among Animals* (and later, his 1879 paper published in *Science*), Alfred Russel Wallace suggested stripes evolved in order to provide camouflage from predators by allowing zebras to blend in with the surrounding area.
This particular hypothesis was refuted by Darwin and others since the stripes do not blend with the usual zebra habitat of short grasses, but the more recent adaptation is that the stripes confuse predators by making it difficult to single out an individual in the group.  However, zebras tend to live in small groups or are solitary, so this might not even be the case.

Some other hypotheses are that the stripes are for social benefits (sexual selection or communication), thermoregulation, and protection from parasites (tsetse flies in particular).  Darwin thought it might be for intrasexual selection and described an experiment in which a female zebra and a male wild ass are placed together and the female zebra would only let the wild ass mate with her when the researchers painted stripes him.

Personally, I think zebra stripes are least likely to be for predator avoidance, but that seems to be the one that has stuck in society's list of animal myths. 
























 It could definitely (and probably does) cause auditory hearing loss because their ears work very much like ours.  The sonar mechanism is a little more tricky.  I'm on mobile now and like I said earlier, I'm feeling particularly tired/lazy so I'm going to try to explain what I can remember about it (which isn't much).  Small cetaceans have an organ on the top of their head called a melon.  I can't recall what's in it, but it's either fluid-filled or fatty and it's highly malleable.  They use it to alter the high frequency sound waves they emit, which bounce off objects in the water.  They receive the returning waves through ~~hollows~~ special sound conducting tissues in their lower jaw, ~~which is either gas-filled or fluid-filled~~, and this amplifies it for them.  ~~I'm not sure off the top of my head if the sonar waves go from the jaw to the ears or if they have another avenue to the brain, but I'll definitely look it up when I get a chance in the next day or so.~~  The sound waves then travel to the inner ear.

So the loud music probably wouldn't damage the melon or jawbone to produce and receive the sonar, but it could affect the inner ear, which is used for auditory hearing as well ~~I'm not sure about the sonar processing pathway.  If it's the ears then it would, but I have a feeling it's not~~.  Echolocation seems to not be as important as auditory hearing though, which I was surprised to learn.  It seems even less important for captive cetaceans, since their environment never changes and is pretty free of obstacles. They probably learn quickly how to avoid running into the walls or bottom at night if it's too dark too see and don't need to use sonar much after that.

EDIT: [NOAA link](http://www.afsc.noaa.gov/nmml/education/cetaceans/cetaceaechol.php) that has good info! 




 Unfortunately, there's been a recent fad of having EDM concerts (or firework shows) at zoos and aquaria.  It's really bad for marine mammals in particular, because of their physiology and the construction of the pools that they are kept in.  Small cetaceans, such as dolphins, in particular have extremely sensitive hearing, so much so that they can even hunt fish solely through auditory sound, as opposed to using sight or echolocation (referenced in [this paper](http://www.econscience.org/val/pubs/orca_refs/barrett-lennard+96.pdf)).  The concrete tanks that cetaceans are kept in also act like giant satellite dishes, amplifying and reverberating any sound waves that enter the tanks (best link I could find is a [heavily anti-captivity blog](http://www.freewebs.com/let_toki_go_free/dolphinswim.htm), but this seems like common sense that bare walls cause echoes).  Also, sounds are naturally amplified by water ([Yahoo answers is the best source I can find quickly](http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20100517162204AAyO0TC), but again, it's common sense that the more dense a fluid, the more concentrated by sound).  Combine all these facts, and you have a terrible situation to be in if you're a cetacean.  It's also awful when you have people feed them things that they shouldn't eat.  Allegedly, captive dolphins are quick to eat just about anything, which could be a stereotypical behavior caused by the lack of stimulus in a captive environment or because they are kept hungry in order to get them to interact with zoo patrons.  I've read stories about people feeding captive dolphins paper, coins, and even lit cigarettes.  This is why I dislike people.

EDIT1: I can try to find links to supporting data later if anyone is interested.  It'd be more about the first half of what I said than the last half (since it's not like zoos and aquaria will let outside researchers study their animals to for the negative impacts captivity has on them).  Although I could find links for the second half, it would all be anecdotal.  It's late at night so I'm far to tired/lazy to do it now.

EDIT2: Links added.  Bonus [link](http://cetaceaninspiration.tumblr.com/post/33537138326/cetacean-hearing-music-in-shows-does-not-hurt) of a good Tumblr debate on the issue of noises affecting captive cetaceans.

TL;DR: Marine mammal captivity sucks. 









 After a hiatus and eventual retooling, Search the City is back and releasing a new album in about 3 weeks.  Much different sound than the previous line up (new singer, drummer, and bassist) but still great! 









 Yeah, if I had to get mauled by a mystery beast, I'd prefer to be completely covered at the time.  




 I think I would stop midstream if that happened to me.  Do you know if it ever tried to attack anyone? 




 Your sister does a great thing!  I'm glad that you and your sister have been able to help him so much.  I've only ever had small pets like fish and mice, but I'm readying a book on the study of animal personalities and it's made me think about many other animals, and mammals in particular, have sets of behaviors that can be as complex and unique as humans.  Those stories you shared were very heartwarming :) 




 I've seen dogs like him before but I don't know what the breed is called.  He's a great looking dog, though! 




 I've heard stories about camel spiders and such, but some unknown beast lurking around sounds much worse! 




 Awh :(  Hopefully the little guy headed back home after he saw you weren't able to give him any more attention! 




 That's really cool, actually!  Dogs seem to respond to high-stress situations much better than people do 
























 My opinion of SeaWorld has changed from one of admiration to one of severe displeasure over the past decade.  That being said, I also understand that as a business, their goal isn't conservation or education; it's to be successful (i.e., make money).  I would just greatly prefer if their business model would change to one that doesn't rely on such abnormal habitat and social conditions for the animals.  Although, as someone who studies animals and not business, I have no idea if that's feasible. 




 You're right.  That chart was made by a person that was actually arguing for captivity, so I was under the impression the person know what he/she was talking about.  [Here](http://24.media.tumblr.com/b3f555b5e519089e3b6992f5718d704e/tumblr_mhq38iFRXn1rmadmwo1_500.jpg) is a chart made by a person arguing against captivity (the first one I posted was supposed to be a rebuttal to this one).  Hopefully this one makes more sense. 




 I wish I had saved the pie chart I saw a couple months ago breaking down how much SeaWorld spends on conservation efforts compared to other things.  I can't remember the figures exactly, but it was an extremely small percentage compared to their profits.  And they often use "rescue" as a reason to get wild animals for their collection.  The park in San Diego often takes sea lions that get trapped in fishing gear, try to train them, keep the ones that are easy to work with and release these half trained, human acclimated animals back into the ocean to get caught in fishing gear again.

And their idea of education is telling people either complete lies (such as that orcas live longer in captivity) or really simple ecological principles (the use of countershading by a ton of different animals).

So they conserve and educate just enough to have their PR team make them sound like the Savior of our oceans.

EDIT: http://img210.imageshack.us/img210/5664/graphtk.jpg

I found the chart I was talking about!  You can't even see the conservation piece (between the green and red pieces).

From the source:
Roughly 0.065% of SeaWorlds annual revenue funds an entire years worth of conservation. To put that in perspective: Target gives 5% of their annual revenue to charity. That is 80 x more money than SeaWorld gives to conservation in the same amount of time.

 NMFS gets petitions like this on a routine basis, almost always from organizations that would profit directly from the delisting of a certain population.  I personally would support the delisting of any group (population or species) that does not need to be listed (i.e., shows an ability to adapt to new human-induced pressure and is at a self-sustaining population size), but I believe most cetaceans are a permanent fixture on the ESL for many reasons (including their slow growth rates, large habitat size, high trophic level, etc.).  Commenting on petitions such as these is definitely important, but I believe that even if the scientific data says the North Pacific population is discrete and thriving, the benefits of keeping them on the ELS would outweigh any possible benefit to the petitioning group. 




 This happened to me a couple weeks ago with a pack of Nature's Path Organic Knockoff Poptarts.  Now I'm lamenting the karma that could have been. :'(

 You're welcome!  I saw Blackfish the first day it came out in my city.  It was a pretty mild look into the life of Tilly, but I enjoyed it overall.  It's a great introduction into the darker side  of captivity.  I'd heard about or seen nearly everything in the movie before then since I've been interested in the topic for about as long as the director has and I think she covers a good amount of information in the 90 minutes she has to present it.  The only inaccuracy (possibly a lie, but I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt) is when the whale researcher says a wild whale has "never harmed a human."  In fact, there is one documented attack on a human (a surfer in California) in the 1970s that required [100 stitches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_whale_attacks_on_humans).  He survived, but I would consider that harming a human and I believe the researcher should have known about that attack.

The book [Death at SeaWorld by David Kirby](http://deathatseaworld.com/) paints a much more in depth portrait into Tilly's psyche.  The Cove is another good documentary into the captivity industry involving smaller cetaceans (mostly bottlenose dolphins).

SeaWorld is extremely good at PR and has been since the very beginning, so I don't think OP is a bad person for his or her viewpoint.  I understand your use of the word "brainwashed" in the context, but I try to believe that people who are fans of SeaWorld have put in the effort to weigh the pros and cons and just came to a different conclusion than I have.  Many of the points I stated before about possible benefits are adequate, but also have stronger counterpoints in my opinion.  It's an extremely complex and emotionally-driven issue, since we can't determine how marine mammals think or feel.  We also can't quantify the benefits attained from any suffering experienced by the captive animals.  The past 40 years have definitely opened a scientific window into the world of marine mammal biology, but I would argue animals owned by corporations are no longer useful for any scientific development.  There are labs around the world that study marine mammal physiology using captive animals that live at the labs, but places like SeaWorld seem to only publish/present information on animal husbandry and breeding, which is only beneficial for their interests of keeping animals captive and sustaining a breeding population for multiple generations, with only a marginal percentage of their profits going to conservation and research.

Overall, I personally would argue against keeping marine mammals in captivity and I have a set of reasons that are unquantifiable and definitely driven by emotions, but other people would argue for captivity for another set of reasons that are just as unquantifiable and driven by emotions.  This is a heavy topic, but it's important to try to remember where people on each side are coming from and to realize that strong opinions come from a love and respect for the animals and that everyone wants what they think is best overall. 




 Adventure Club made a mix that contained a mashup of those two songs.  I hadn't heard the Bruno Mars song and only heard the Goyte song a couple times before and thought it was just one song until I looked at the track list.

 I'm sort of late to the game on this post, but I'm bored so I searched "SeaWorld" on here to see what showed up.  Hopefully I can help out with your question.  I'll preface my answer my saying I spent a good portion of my childhood and early teens at SeaWorld (last time I went was maybe around '07 or '08), but as I've gotten older I've developed a pretty anticaptivity stance based on the information I've come across, particularly after the death of Dawn the trainer in 2010.  Also, I'm on mobile, so bare with me as I can't look back at either your or OP's comment, so I'll try to remember everything. 

I believe OP is referring to programs such as summer camps, visiting schools, school field trips, internships, etc. when (s)he is talking about education.  I took summer camps there every summer for about a decade, when were definitely fun as a kid, but the actual animal knowledge gained from the experience was probably equivalent to a BBC documentary.  The focus was more on how the workers take care of the animals.  Therefore, I would argue that, at least in my experience with the summer camps, it's more of a recruiting/propaganda tool (Note: I'm not insisting that this is a bad thing, I believe that if the animals are there, the trainers better be the best and brightest available).  Although, the mystique and celebrity status of being a SeaWorld trainer makes the jobs veey competitive, which means the company can give trainers low pay and terrible benefits because they know that for every 1 person that quits, 100 would be willing to take the job.  I guess what I'm saying is that yes, there is an educational aspect, but it's very minimal.  Oh, and the company feeds workers false info to tell patrons regarding the negative aspects of captivity.

Next point is "awareness" I think.  I'm sure that some people are unaware of these animals, but I don't think that SeaWorld is the only avenue for them to learn. In the Internet Age, we can learn a ton about all the animals at SeaWorld.  The only thing SeaWorld provides on this front is a hands-on or close-proximity experience.  These are awesome.  It's amazing to be that close to these mysterious creatures.  The only questions is whether or not you personally think it's worth it for the animals.  I don't, but others do and that's okay.  This is aa complex issue with many opinions. 

Conservation is often times tied in with awareness by procaptivity people, but how many people do you think change their lifestyle just because they went to SeaWorld?  I'd guess not very many.  Plus SeaWorld San Diegovhas gotten in trouble for dumping chemicals into Mission Bay on multiple occasions, so there's that too.

OP brought up rescuing and releasing animals.  The fact of the matter is they use this more as a way to get new animals more than anything.  They find hurt/isolated/nuisance animals, try to acclimate them to captivity, keep the ones that take to it well (even if healthy again), and release the ones that aren't good once those are healthy.  The issue here is the released animals are then used to being around people and are likely to end up in a vulnerable position again.  They don't release high profit animals such as whales, the notable exception being J.J. the juvenile gray whale, but that's because there is no tank large enough to hold an adult.  In fact, SeaWorld wanting nothing to do with the rescue effort at first, but after other groups agreed to foot the bill, they obliged to house it after others caught it.  Only a very small portion of profits go towards rescues, so I look at it as more of a PR move than anything.  Also, you are incorrect about SeaWorld rescuing orcas.  All of SeaWorld's wild orcas were caught by teams of boats and divers.  SeaWorld workers say they were rescued, so I don't blame you for not knowing that.  The only whale that might fall into the rescue category is Morgan, who was an orphan found in the Netherlands in 2011.  An aquarium there took her in and the law there says she had to be released when she was healthy, but they sold her to a park in the Canary Islands instead since that park has other orcas for Morgan to interact with.  After a long legal battle, in which the park presented evidence that Morgan was hard of hearing and couldn't be released, the court said they could keep her, but not profit off her.  Most people would take that to mean no shows.  Morgan still does shows.  Anyways,  before Morgan this Canary Islands park got 3 or 4 whales on a loan from SeaWorld.  I'm not sure about the contract wording, but SeaWorld has now laid claim on Morgan as theirs.  We'll have to see what happens on that front. 

Instead of looking at SeaWorld as a group of cruel people, I try to look at them as a business that uses animals as a commodity.  They try to maximize profits above all else.  It's in their interests to keep animals alive and performing, but happiness is not something they care about.  I understand everything they do from a business standpoint, but I do not think it's moral.

Sorry for the novel, but this is a complex issue and one that I care deeply about.  Hopefully it helps you get a grasp on it.  If you're interested in more info, feel free to pm me and I can try to get more in depth and set you up with links to do your own research.  




 That's very true.  It's highly unlikely that music at these events is loud enough to completely deafen the people or the animals.  However, concert speakers are huge and can register some extremely high dB.  Especially the kind that would be used in a large outdoor area such as a zoo.  Hopefully the speakers would be as far away from the animals as possible, but if not, exposure to loud, sustained noise can cause hearing sensitivity loss just the same as a person standing close to an extremely loud speaker.  These effects are even greater with low frequency bass sounds, which is prevalent in EDM music.  If it's not loud enough to cause any injury, it still has the potential to cause pain or discomfort.  I imagine it gets pretty stressful and annoying to the animals to have these events a couple times a year, even if they don't get injured as a result.  
























 This is a question that greatly interests me (specifically, nitrogen loading during dives)!  Hopefully I can give you an adequate answer, as I only recently started to dive into the appropriate literature. 

All vertebrates have a reflex known as the diving response which conserves oxygen stores but it is more developed in diving air-breathing vertebrates (whales, seals, turtles, penguins, etc.).  This reflex is manifested as peripheral vasoconstriction (reduced blood flow to muscles) and bradycardia (reduced heart-rate).  Also, deeper- and longer-diving species have an increased body mass, decreased relative lung size, increased blood volume, and increased myoglobin (oxygen-binding protein found in muscle tissue) concentration, suggesting these are dive-related adaptations.

 That might be a good way to go, thanks! 




 Thanks!  




 Thanks!  I've been considering going that route and I'm glad to hear it seems to be beneficial. 




 I'm interested in lifting, but haven't done so since I did it a few times for sports my freshman year of high school (7 years ago), so I have no idea how to even get into it (routine, technique, etc.).  Do you guys have any suggestions?  I've been going to the RPAC and doing cardio stuff 2-3 times a week for about a year, but I'd love to do something else! 




 Also, there are at least two distinct grey whale populations in the North Pacific.  They both feed around Alaska in the warmer months, but when it's gets colder, one group moves down to Baja and the other moves toward Japan to breed. Since this one (or two?) was found in Baja, I don't think it's mother ever went close enough to Fukushima to be affected by the radiation leak. 




 I saw an interview with one of the helicopter pilots a couple years ago in which he said it's against maritime law for aircraft to drop things onto ships.  I imagine that would apply to drones as well. 




 I've heard that 70% of the money SeaWorld makes comes directly from the captivity of orcas, so that would be an interesting question to look in to - whether or not they could afford their rescue and rehab programs without the orcas.  Even so, is the good that SeaWorld does outweighed by the problems associated with captivity?  Would people care more/less and provide more/less money to conservation if there was no SeaWorld?  It's hard to say either way. 




 Actually, [the United States hasn't whaled since 1927.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whaling_in_the_United_States)  There was a huge uproar from locals when SeaWorld caught orcas in 1976 in Puget Sound (note, 50 years after the end of industrial whaling), so much so that the [state of Washington made it illegal to capture whales in their waters.](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/whales/etc/cron.html)   However, I will give you that the capture of orcas in the 1960s and 1970s did change national public perception of orcas - prior to that, they were feared (much like great white sharks) and were even used as target practice by the navy.

Another thing is that these whales are not domesticated.  In fact, I would argue there are not enough captive whales to ever have domesticated population.  The wild whales that were caught were not caught because of their personalities, they were caught solely because they were the smallest.  Domestication takes many generations, much more than the 1-3 generation whales that are currently in captivity.  And the fact that orcas are much more intelligent than any domesticated animals, rivaling human cognition, now makes the prospect that much more difficult.

Also, SeaWorld has an orca in it's collection that was taken from the wild in 2010.  She is currently at a park in the Canary Islands called Loro Parque, but all the whales there are considered loans from SeaWorld.

Saying SeaWorld dedicates themselves to education, research, and conservation is also a stretch.  They provide a lot of misinformation or complete falsities about ocras, in particular (you can find videos on YouTube of the staff saying things to people that the people know are false).  They do have a research branch and do fund projects, and they also provide their orcas for research on general anatomy and physiology, but a majority of their research is based on animal husbandry.  They also participate in strandings and other animal rescues, but that's about the extent of their conservation efforts.  SeaWorld is a business, so they're dedicated to making money, which is perfectly acceptable to me and I have no issue with that.  They care about keeping the animals they have healthy, getting more animals (either through breeding or through animals that they rescue), and getting people in the door.  Most people go the SeaWorld for excitement, which is why you see more rides there than you do interactive climate models.

Now, there are a ton of issues associated with releasing the whales, which I [answer in detail here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/marinebiology/comments/1thxi6/marine_biologists_of_reddit_could_sea_worlds/ce8cq7s)  Another wrinkle I didn't mention before is that a majority of the whales have worn out teeth that have been drilled out and need to be flushed regularly to avoid infection - so that would also cause an issue with release.

I do think that people who go to SeaWorld enjoy the anthropomorphic relationship presented during the shows.  However, I don't think that people change their lifestyle habits in order to reduce their impact on wild orcas.  People go to SeaWorld to feel good, not really to think about the uncertain future of some of most beautiful and intelligent species on Earth.

There is no easy (or probably best) answer to where to go as a society in terms of captivity for large, intelligent animals, but I'm glad that we are having the discussion. 




 Very interesting and multifaceted question.  I will try to hit the major points of it and will use a comment I wrote about a similar question I answered about a week ago to broaden it.  I'm also going to try to correct some misconceptions you write, but please try not to take them with any hard feelings!

 there are two sides to every story

This is correct, and as an avid supporter of the movie Blackfish, I feel it is important to note that it is an activist film.  I've studied the captivity issue for about as long as the director of the movie has, but unfortunately some of the information is presented in a biased or false manner.  For example, the scientist that studies the whales around Puget Sound said that a wild orca whale has never harmed a person, but wikipedia [has a list of what could be considered attacks, including one on a surfer that was extremely severe.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_whale_attacks_on_humans)  Also the movie doesn't explain that, Tilly was caught with another young whale, and both were kept in a giant tank in a hangar-like building in Europe and trained there through punishment before he could be moved to Canada.  I believe I read this in the book, [Death at SeaWrold by David Kirby](http://deathatseaworld.com/), but I which the movie would have talked about this more because I believe this early trauma was just as important as that he received at Sealand of the Pacific.  It may direct some of the public hatred away from the captive parks themselves, but I think it would make the movie feel less biased.  Although I think the backlash the captive industry is receiving is justified, I had a sour taste in my mouth from these two instances in the film the first time I watched it.

If you are interested in the topic of captivity, I would suggest you look into Death at SeaWorld, as well as the documentary, [A Fall From Freedom](http://vimeo.com/40600148), and the Frontline special, [A Whale of a Business.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fZ2dMdtu8)

 He now sits in a seperated tank and is cordoned off from everyone else

According to SeaWorld, he was kept alone because he was afraid of the tanks that had the new safety floors installed, but they have been trying to acclimate him to them.  I don't know if this is true or not since I haven't been there in about a decade, but I hope the trainers wouldn't let him be isolated for something he did almost 4 years ago.

 starving the animals of food to perform so that they can be fed

They don't starve the animals at SeaWorld since they need the animals to be healthy.  They do something they call positive reinforcement.  Essentially, the whales do something the trainers like and the whales get something they like.  The whales get fed outside of shows (I've seen this myself), but it wouldn't surprise me (as stated in Blackfish) if the meals are cut before important shows to make the whales more likely to perform.  I've been at shows where one or two of the whales aren't interested in performing, so I know that the whales don't feel it's completely necessary for their survival that they go through with every single performance.  This is my own personal opinion, but I would equate the shows with a set of weights in a prison yard - it's mostly something to keep the whales somewhat occupied during their barren, under-stimulated existences.

 why can't we just end the captivity and performing of these wild animals? I understand that it is a huge revenue stream

You answered your own question.  SeaWorld is a huge business, which is why these animals are still performing.  If people didn't go to see cetaceans in captivity, the captive industry would grind to a halt.  However, this would lead to the discussion of what to do with the animals, which is actually very complicated.  I'd say that it would be impossible to release all of the captive killer whales (not to mention the other captive marine mammals) and expect them all to survive.  I think the whales that were born in the wild would have an easier time adjusting back to that kind of lifestyle than would the captive-born whales that had never experienced a natural environment. I'm sure you could train all of them to hunt though, at least enough to get by.  Also, the price would be astronomical.  Keiko was a challenge and he was 1 whale, I can't imagine funding and organize the release of the almost 30 orca owned by SeaWorld (or the 54 total in captivity worldwide).

What would be even more challenging would be to determine where to release captive-born whales (34 of the 54 worldwide). SeaWorld's wild whales came from 2 different parts of the world - the Pacific Northwest (U.S. and Canada) and the North Atlantic (Iceland). They have also recently been getting sperm from an orca named Kshamenk, who resides at Mundo Marino and was captured off the coast of Argentina. Orca have very distinct cultures, for example, in the Pacific Northwest, there are 4 distinct "cultures" - Northern Residents, Southern Residents, Transients, and Offshores - that rarely interact and never interbreed. These "cultures" each have their own unique forms of communication, known as dialects. The North Atlantic population is less studied than the Pacific Northwest population, but I assume there are also distinct "cultures" in that population.

Keiko was released in the general area that he was captured in and was seen traveling with other whales from time to time, but it never seemed that he was accepted into any pod. I have a feeling that other North Atlantic whales, such as Tilikum, would probably end up in a similar position if released, but it is hard to say since Keiko spent so much of his life in isolation. Springer, a Southern Resident whale in the Pacific Northwest who was orphaned and rehabilitated in a sea pen, was adopted by her aunt's pod, so it's possible that a whale like Lolita at the Miami Seaquarium could be taken in by a pod if she were released, since she was captured from a Southern Resident pod.
Back to the captive-born whales. Many of them are genetic mixtures of Pacific Northwest, North Atlantic, and now Southern Atlantic whales. This means that it's possible wild whales could reject them based on morphology alone. Not to mention how incestual the genetic lines are in the SeaWorld whales, which makes it difficult to decide how to define what a family group is amongst the captive whales and how to divide them between release locations.

I would be interested in finding out how the whales communicate at the parks now. If the captive-born ones seem to be using a dialect similar to any one particular group that was passed down to them by the older wild-caught whales, maybe they could be released in the area where that dialect originates. That's assuming that the whales haven't come up with their own crude captive (possibly even park-specific) dialect(s). If they did that, you could make the case of releasing them all together in one spot, but that probably wouldn't be the best idea since some of the captive whales seem to show high levels of aggression towards one another. Also, there probably aren't many places that have a local ecology that could handle such an influx of apex predators.
Plus, the released whales would probably act like Keiko and seek out human interaction, which would be especially bad for them if they were to congregate in a high-traffic, highly populated area.


 Why can't we just release them back into the wild and if people want to see them go on Whale Watching tours, visit a national park, or just go out to that animal's natural habitat and observe them being them, rather than performing some mundane trick for your enjoyment.

These are much better options in my opinion, but are not perfect.  Whale watching can be rather hit-or-miss when it comes to seeing the whales or dolphins you want to see, and you rarely (if ever) get as close to the animals as you do in captive facilities.  Captivity gives the public this sense of bonding with the animals, even though it's completely fabricated and unrealistic.  Visiting natural habitats also has it's problems.  For example, there is an issue with the amount of pollution in the Galapagos Islands (which are considered a nature reserve) from the sheer number of tourists that visit the area annually.  I'm hoping that as technology improves, we'll have things like simulators or maybe ROVs or something awesome that hasn't even been thought of yet that can bring more people the joys of the natural world around us without imposing the problems of more people on the wilderness.



But anyway, in terms of captivity, I think the best route for us to take is to focus on the young, recently captured whales, like Morgan from the Netherlands who was captured in 2010, Narnia from Russia who was captured in 2012, or the 7 whales captured in Russia in September and October of 2013.  If any whales were able to be successfully released, it would most likely be these whales.

Let me know if you're interested in more information on this subject, I'd be more than happy to either elaborate or provide you with some direction on where to look!  I'd apologize for the wall of text, but this topic is a passion of mine and I think it needs to be explained as thoroughly as possible! 




 Possibly.

I think the whales that were born in the wild would have an easier time adjusting back to that kind of lifestyle than would the captive-born whales that had never experienced a natural environment.  I'm sure you could train all of them to hunt though.

These "cultures" each have their own unique forms of communication, known as dialects.  The North Atlantic population is less studied than the Pacific Northwest population, but I assume there are also distinct "cultures" in that population.

Keiko (Free Willy) was released in the general area that he was captured in and was seen traveling with other whales from time to time, but it never seemed that he was accepted into any pod.  I have a feeling that other North Atlantic whales, such as Tilikum, would probably end up in a similar position if released, but it is hard to say since Keiko spent so much of his life in isolation.

So, if by survive you mean not die immediately of starvation then probably, but if you mean live like a normal wild whale then the answer is almost definitely not. 




 Very true.  I'm not sure how to find these financing figures, but it would be interesting to see how for-profit zoos and aqauriums compare to SeaWorld. 





























 Nice!  It goes to show that I should read an article instead of just skimming through it.  Thanks for letting me know! 




 While I agree with the sentiment, I just can't see this actually passing.  SW is (unfortunately) a HUGE money maker for southern California so I don't see the reps from that area allowing it to pass. 




 Hi Skrillex!

I wanted to thank you for introducing me to the dubstep genre.

Do you agree with those that say dubstep is a dying (if not already dead) genre?

I believe there are still some phenomenal dubstep producers creating amazing music, but it seems as though many people believe that the popularity of the genre will never again be close to what it was in 2011/2012. 




 I have what was described to me as a corn sensitivity, but is essentially an intolerance (intestinal cramping, IBS, other digestive discomforts).  I've been dealing with it for about 6 or 7 years now, and you definitely learn to pay attention to the ingredients in food.  The cool thing is that recently there has been a bump in cane (or beet) sugar popularity, at least in my region of the U.S.  You have to avoid things that you used to consume regularly, but, at least for me, there were great, albeit more expensive, alternatives available.  If anything, I feel more freed to try new things and diversify my diet than I do limited by not having (many) corn-derived products.

Good luck to you on your new edible adventure! 




 Don't herta yourself coming up with one. 




 I have a 2 foot tall brachiosaurus statue in my yard!  He's not as interesting as this guy, unfortunately.  We sometimes put a little mask on him for Halloween, but that's about it in terms of dressing up. 




 If you're looking for rap over a dubstep beat, one of my favorites is [Like This (feat. Virus Syndicate)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xishhKPQ9Nw feature=kp) by SKisM.  Flux Pavilion was who really got me hooked onto dubstep - [I Can't Stop is one of his most well known songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q9rewnLFYw) but he also does a song called [Do or Die](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRNqRuyFSXk) with rap from Childish Gambino.  I also recommend [Dodge   Fuski](https://soundcloud.com/dodgeandfuski).  I love [Zomboy](https://soundcloud.com/zomboy) as well.  If you're interested in a more melodic/chill kind of sound, Seven Lions also makes great melodic dubstep.  His remix of [Running to the Sea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFZREifFcEs) is one of my most favorite songs right now.

A majority of the dubstep artists I listen to are signed on to either on [Never Say Die Records](http://www.wewillneversaydie.com/mixes/) or [Disciple Recordings](http://www.disciplerecs.com/mixes/), both of which release free mixes made by their artists periodically.  I'd say my favorites at NSD are SKisM, Zomboy, and Eptic.  Disciple Recs is younger, so I only really know Dodge   Fuski (who used to be with NSD), but I'm really liking what Pegboard Nerds and Astronaut are putting out.  You should also check out the artists over at [OWSLA](http://owsla.com/artists/), which is where Skrillex and Seven Lions are
signed.  Kill Paris, Kill the Noise, and Porter Robinson are also great from OWSLA.

As far as trap goes, I don't listen to much, but I do like things by Brillz, LOUDPVCK, RL Grime, Buku, and Baauer.

Sorry this turned into a wall of text, but hopefully this will help you find something you like!
 














 I'm currently going through the grad school application process which involves emailing a huge number of professors about their labs and I'd say my response rate is about 50 percent.  It seems like a majority of the professors that I have interacted with in this process and also during my undergrad are more than happy to help students, especially ones that show an interest in what they work on! 




 If you strike out here, I'd suggest looking up research papers on a particular marine mammal-related topic you're interested in and emailing the authors.  It's likely many of them will be too busy and will decline or may miss your email altogether, but I'm sure you'd find someone willing to talk about his or her research!

Edit: autocorrect-induced errors 
























 First, you'll need a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW).  I'd suggest downloading [Reaper](http://www.reaper.fm/), which is a (basically) free software - it has a 60 day free trial, but still works exactly the same after the trial "ends."  I also have [FL Studio](http://www.image-line.com/flstudio/), but I use Reaper to manipulate audio files because I think it's the easier of the two to use for that.

After you have your DAW, find 2 (or more) songs you like!  It helps if they have similar BPM, but that's not a necessity.  A good rule of thumb I use is if they're within 10% of one another (I think I made one with a 128 BPM song and a 140 BPM song).

Download the songs you want to use (in Reaper, .wav files are generally easier to use than .mp3 files, so convert your songs with iTunes, a website, or some other means if you can).

Finally, open the files of the songs with your DAW and have fun!  Mashups are a great way to spend some spare time!!! 




 No problem!  Just wanted to help straighten things out for you if you had gotten confused.  Orcas are the largest oceanic dolphin species but, interestingly, they and the other blackfish (dolphins that are predominately black) have "whale" in their common name! 




 Are you saying since killer whales are toothed whales they're also dolphins?  If so, that's not true.  Sperm whales, beaked whales, and porpoises are all toothed whales and are not (oceanic) dolphins. 

If you're comparing killer whales to other toothed whales and saying that since killer whales are more closely related to oceanic dolphins than to other toothed whales, then you're correct.  




 Taxonomically, yes.  Whales are any species that belong to the order Cetacea and oceanic dolphins are any species that belong to the family Delphinidae (river dolphins encompass a few different families).  So from a taxonomic context, you'd be correct saying a killer whale is a whale, correct and more specific saying a killer whale is a dolphin, correct and most specific saying a killer whale is an oceanic dolphin, but wrong saying a killer whale is not a dolphin (or an oceanic dolphin). 

But this might not be the case in common nomenclature.  People tend to call small whales with a pronounced rostrum, "dolphins," which is a characterization that killer whales (and other "blackfish" - pilot whales, false killer whales, and pygmy killer whales) don't fit.  And there are also dolphins without pronounced beaks, such as the Risso's and Irrawaddy dolphins but they're smaller than .  River dolphins are not in the family Delphinidae, but are still called dolphins because of the large rostrums they have. Generally speaking, people call big cetaceans "whales," small cetaceans with conical teeth "dolphins," and small cetaceans with spade-shaped teeth "porpoises."  So from a common nomenclature context, you wouldn't be wrong calling a killer whale a whale since they're large relative to the other members of the family Delphinidae and the river dolphins and they don't have a pointy beak.

TL;DR: there's a difference between taxonomic and common nomenclature - in common nomenclature, many families are lumped together as "dolphins" and large oceanic dolphins are called "whales." 




 **E** 




 Sweatpants have been my go-to cold weather leg covering for years (to be fair though, I'm a college student).  They just feel better to me than jeans do!  I've also gone through some rapid weight fluctuations (down 30, down another 20, up 30, up another 30, down 30, etc.), so it's easier to have sweat pants with draw strings than cycle through a bunch of different sized jeans.  Also, they're making some nice looking sweats nowadays with pockets and normal pant legs (no more of the elastic-ringed bottoms)! 




 Sure thing!  And thanks for the advice!  I think I'm only going to get Massive now and if I decide I want more, I can always wait until the next sale. 




 Thanks!  I've heard positive things about massive and as long as it's as robust as I've heard, I may just stick with that (plus whatever comes with the DAW I decide to buy) for now.  This is definitely just a recreational activity for me so I think it might be best to go with the easier one for now. 




 Thanks!  I'm looking at producing as more of a hobby than anything so I want to keep my expenses down but still be able to make something that has a good quality.  From searching Reddit, it seems that synths go on sale rather frequently, so hopefully if you can't afford them now, you can afford them next time around!  




 That might be a good way to go!  I'm coming at this from a hobby point of view so I don't want to throw too much money into it, but I also want to have enough tools to set myself up to be successful in making something I enjoy.  




 Awesome, thanks!  I originally saw this link in r/FL_Studio and when I looked at the "Other Discussions" tab, there wasn't one for the post in this sub for some reason. 




 I've been interested in making music for a while and have played around with free DAW trials and free synths, but haven't actually bought any software yet.  Any suggestions on which of these to get?  I know Massive is good, but I don't know anything about the other synths. 












































 Velvetine - The Great Divide (Seven Lions Remix): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMmuxolcE6E

I have yet to hear a Seven Lions remix that I don't like better than the original! 




 Hi!  I'm a Master's student studying marine mammals so hopefully I can help you out a bit.

The first thing I would say is to figure out generally what you are interested in by reading as many papers as possible.   My senior year of undergrad I had no idea what I was interested in (other than doing SOMETHING with marine mammals) and going through the literature helped me narrow it down to a few different research interests.  You're going to be thinking about one project 24/7 for years so you need to make sure you like it (or at least not want to pull all your hair out over it)!

As you're going along and reading papers on topics you think are neat, you'll probably notice the same authors showing up again and again.  You should look up the CVs of these researchers and see where they are/if they take on graduate students.  To be honest, people will not care which grad school you went to - they will care about who you know and who you've worked with.  Marine mammals is such a competitive field and 90-100% of your success in it will come through your ability to network.

So, once you have a list of potential advisors, email them!  Ask what they are looking for in a student and tell them what you bring to the table (and it sounds like you have a lot to offer with the amount of research experience you have!).  If they have room in their lab for a new student, be sure to set up an interview either in person (preferably) or over Skype to talk about their university, ideas for projects, etc. while getting a feel for their personality.  You and your advisor are going to be working long, stressful hours together, so you need to make sure you are compatible and/or functional together. 

I ended up finding a PI who studies something that I think is absolutely fascinating (diving physiology), who has a fantastic network already, and that I get along well with, and although we're not at a "top-tier" university, I feel like the implications of the research I'm doing and the opportunities I've gotten through my advisor's connections are going to surpass any advantage I'd have had I just gone to a well-known marine biology program for the sake of getting a degree from a big name school.

I hope this helps and feel free to PM me if you have any more questions!  Good luck :) 




 It did, thanks for asking!  Ended up going with a place on my own, which I think was the right choice 




 Hey, I graduated from OSU this past spring with a BS in E E and am now in a Marine Bio Master's program!

My advice on where to start is to find and read recent papers on topics that interest you.  This will give you an idea of what you are really interested in and could get passionate about (remember, you're going to be thinking about a single topic 24/7 for at least the next 2 years while doing your thesis, so you need to be sure you like it).

Then you should look up the authors of papers that caught your attention and contact people than you could see yourself working with.  It's much more important to have an advisor you feel you can be successful with than to go to a renowned Marine Bio program.

Also, don't get discouraged by rejection!  I emailed between 30 and 40 professors, got a reply from maybe 10, and only interviewed with 3.  Lucky for me, one of those 3 was my top choice for an advisor. 

If you have any other questions or would just like to talk more about this more, feel free to PM me.

Go Bucks! 




 Hey, I'm a graduate student currently studying diving physiology in marine mammals!  My lab considers penguins "honorary mammals" since they are the only birds that perform these deep dives.

The dogma in marine mammal physiology for the last 70+ years was that marine mammals simply cannot get the bends, or decompression sickness (DCS) - that they must have adaptations that made it impossible, such as their ability to collapse their lungs, slow their heart rate, quickly ventilate, stop blood from going to their lungs, etc.  HOWEVER, in the past 10 years or so, the people I am working with have found evidence that it is in fact possible!

So, although the exact cause of "the bends" or decompression DCS is not known, there is (in my opinion) overwhelming evidence that nitrogen bubbles forming in the blood and body tissues are the culprit, or at least involved in the process.  As these animals dive, the air (oxygen, carbon dioxde, nitrogen) in their lungs is dissolved in the blood.  Nitrogen is an inert gas, meaning animals do not use it for metabolic processes.  Therefore, as it moves through the bloodstream and into the tissues, it is not used up and just stays there.  As the animals dive deeper and deeper, more and more of the air in the lungs can diffuse into the blood (deeper water = [greater pressure = more dissolved gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry's_law)).  When they begin to return to the surface, the pressure gets weaker, so the gas that was dissolved in the blood starts to come out of solution and form bubbles.

Now, there is evidence that this happens on every dive (including for human divers), so why don't they get DCS every single time they do it?!?  Most of the time, the bubbles are considered "silent bubbles" which cause absolutely no damage.  These bubbles are small and the animal is able to move them back to the lungs, then remove them when they ventilate at the surface.  Too many bubbles in the bloodstream can lead to blood hemorrhaging in organs and burst blood vessels (which is what we have found in stranded/bycatch marine mammals).  What makes DCS tricky is that we haven't been able to quantify how many bubbles are" too many" bubbles in marine mammals or humans, as it seems to vary by individual.  

I know of two hypotheses for what causes DCS in marine mammals, both of which have to do with naval sonar.  The first is that the sonar causes them to freak out and ascend too quickly, leading to too many bubbles for the lungs to handle.  The second is that the energy of the sonar wave causes pressure fluctuations inside the body of the animal, causing the nitrogen bubbles to more easily come out of solution.  However, there is very little data on DCS or the effects of sonar on marine mammals and we hope to be able to answer these questions in the next few years! 




 Hello!  I posted this in the TAMUCC subreddit, but it's much less active than this one so I figured I'd post here as well.

I'm going to be a grad student (single guy, 22 yrs old) starting at TAMUCC this fall and am in Corpus this weekend looking at apartments. I'm intrigued by the concept of places like Campus Quarters or Islander Village because I'm from another state and don't know anyone here (these places set you up with 2 or 3 roommates in furnished suites), but a majority of the reviews make them sound like hell holes. I also looked at a lot of nice 1 bedroom places on the south side, but I'm worried about becoming a hermit if I live by myself. Does anyone have any advice or suggestions?

Thanks!

 Apparently, there are some branches of the libertarian political philosophy ([Green](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_libertarianism) and [Geolibertarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geolibertarianism)) that are particularly concerned with the environment and natural resources.
