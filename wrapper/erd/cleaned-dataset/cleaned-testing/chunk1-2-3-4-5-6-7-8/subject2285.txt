 I watched the movie after reading Emma's praise about the story.But i was really disappointed with the movie.A total disaster and waste of time. 




 Nah.Diesel is not a sword guy.He's all muscle.Looking forward to it. 




 Good film.Unique and excellent screenplay.Jake and Tony did a great job. 
























 Mirror, Mirror and Snow White and the Huntsman 




 It is a bit underrated movie although i think it deserves much more than that.I liked the movie very much.Brad Pitt,Casey Affleck did a great job.The directing was very good too.The concept of narrating the story was great. 




 After watching Part-1 my ideas on crime movies were never the same again.And no other crime movie can compete with it either. 
























 Totally agree with you on that. 




 I didn't say she praised the movie.I said she praised the script.I read that she said it was a wonderful script and she just had to act in it.

 You're right. Ratatouille's screenplay is easily the best among the Pixar franchise. 




 I agree with you on that.Though it is not number 1 on the box office.But still it has a gross.And its going to increase as the both the number 1 and number 2 films are a bit old now. 




 Everyone forgot E.T:The Extra Terrestrial (1982)
I would also like to add
Driving Miss Daisy (1989)
Ordinary People (1980)
Rain Man (1988)
The Breakfast Club (1985)
National Lampoon's Vacation (1983)

 
























 Damn that was a good holiday. 




 My niece was born this year and she was named Elsa. 




 I wouldn't say its great.But its not that bad. 
























 'The Theory of Everything' was good too. 




 (and) Gravity(2013), Source Code(2011), Cloud Atlas(2012) 




 Great news.Loved the movie. I think its the best movie of Tim Burton. 
























 "Ohh... I am not gonna kill you .......I am just gonna hurt you..really..really bad!" 




 Incredible. Really looking forward to it. 




 I think Pierce Brosnan is the best bond ever. 
























 What? Shrek 2 was great. Really funny movie. 




 Its gonna be good...
