 Depends on how we would handle drug addiction as a health issue. If we handled it as a personal responsibly issue like cigarettes and alcohol, it would cost us a lot less, probably even generate income in tax revenue.

 Just pointing out that a little over half those suicides in the U.S. are also gun deaths, so saying that there are more suicides than gun deaths isn't exactly accurate. 




 A gun shot is thought to be the most common and effective way to commit suicide, and accounts for 53.7% of all suicides in the United States.

http://www.suicidemethods.net/suicide-methods/ 




 and yet in your past you did not have school shooting.

The earliest known U.S. school shooting was the Pontiac's Rebellion school massacre on July 26, 1764, where four men entered the schoolhouse near present-day Greencastle, Pennsylvania, shot and killed schoolmaster Enoch Brown, and killed nine or ten children (reports vary). Only three children survived.

 If your options are

a) Your child must quit school and work or they will not eat and will always be employed in a low paying job because they are uneducated and their children will also not go to school because they too must choose working over an education.

or

b) The community will pay for your child's food so that the child may remain in school, receiving an education which will allow them to make more money as an adult and not have to choose between having their children working or getting an education.

Would any parent say "No thank you, I would like my children to remain uneducated and poor"? 




  low illiteracy 

would mean that more people in those countries had received an education and could read, low *literacy* would mean fewer people could read. Is that what you meant? 




 Actually, the family is incentivized to produce educated children who will be more prosperous in adulthood and not need welfare, than children who work instead of becoming educated and will always be employed in low wage jobs.  




 Countries with low rates of literacy, have high rates of poverty. 




 Unless that family lives in in a county that provides public assistance, which was my point. 




 Compare [this map](http://www.glpinc.org/High_Literacy_Clusters/world_literacy_map_unhd_2007_2008.png), with [this one](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/Percentage_population_living_on_less_than_$2_per_day_2009.png).

Why would they if

If there is nothing to to gained, what's the point? 









 In the 12 months since the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., almost every state has enacted at least one new gun law, according to a database compiled by the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Nearly two-thirds of the new laws ease restrictions and expand the rights of gun owners. 

http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/12/10/us/state-gun-laws-enacted-in-the-year-since-newtown.html

If most of the new laws enacted were at the local level and "eased restrictions and expand the rights of gun owners" seems like NRA would have had more of a motive than the government. 




 My problem with this is motive, I don't see how the government gained anything in Sandy Hook. What right do you not have now, that you had just before Sandy Hook?

People who refuse to buy health insurance screw over the rest of us when they run up huge medical bills they can't pay by causing the hospitals to charge the rest of us higher prices to make up the difference which leaves insurers no choice but to raise our rates. I'll be glad to see them voluntarily paying higher taxes that they could have avoided by simply buying something that they needed to buy in the first place. They're no better than people who build their house in a floodplain and expect FEMA to bail them out every ten years.      




 Kinda doubt batmanEXPLOSION is an adult. 



















 This is my guess, after de Blasio "indicated his commitment to tackling the problem with a new approach" homeless people, from other places, moved to NY, figuring it would be easier to be homeless in NY.

 Martin OMalley Criticizes Hillary Clinton for Flip-Flopping

 Hillary Clinton Said to Hire Former Wall Street Cop as Campaign CFO

 Hillary Clinton's presidential announcement video is creepy 

 Gutfeld: Hillary's Campaign Rollout More Staged Than 'My Fair Lady'

 Doesn't seem  like /r/politics is trying to justify Hillary at all.

 We're gonna in up puttin' Nancy Reagan on the Twenty, I just know it. 




 It's been two year since Ted Nugent was supposed to be dead or in jail if Obama was reelected, so we at least know that making a prediction like that one or calling the President a subhuman mongrel, doesn't fit the criteria for who gets on the kill list.

 Meanwhile property taxes in Alabama are like 0.33%. 



















 OP didn't write the headline or the article, OP just posted on Reddit.  




 These kids are probably on some pedos radar by now, and no good will come of that either. 




 This was probably true in 1858 as well.

 I wouldn't be surprised. I live in a neighborhood with alot of hispanics and I've noticed one thing, no single parents.   




 I propose that we use his full birth-name, Rafael Eduardo Cruz, every time he is referred to from now on. You know, like in '08 whenever conservatives mentioned Obama, they said "Barack Hussein Obama". 




 I suppose the correct response would have been to issue a letter of marque and reprisal. 




 Saying that someone would be an excellent office holder if elected and saying that you endorse that candidate for that office is two different things.  




 I feel like we need another Truman or LBJ, so Hillary Clinton. 




 The threat of incarceration even though it's a non violent offence? 




 What President wouldn't say their former Secretary of State would be "excellent president"? It would be news worthy if he had said he didn't really think she was up to the job or something.   




 Would not paying the ticket count as a "nonviolent crime", would they get another ticket for that? 




 Nonpayment of child support is a victimless crime? 




 Ten lines in
"The government ought to leave non-violent offenders alone," said Paul. "If a guy is selling loose cigarettes and not paying the king's ransom in taxes, couldn't we give him a ticket instead of throwing him to the pavement?

Maybe you should read more than the first paragraph. This about more than drugs, he even mentions people being jailed for nonpayment of court ordered child support. 




 And selling untaxed cigarettes and not paying court costs and not paying student loans. 




 And what do we do if he doesn't pay the ticket worth billions? Write him one for trillions? That'll teach 'em. 




 "Even with child support, its a good example of how unintended consequences come about," Paul said.

Clearly he is talking about more than just drugs here. 




 Literally.  




 Look up Chain of Fools and Run Through the Jungle. 




 Y'all realize that the Banksters and corrupt politicians count as "non-violent offenders", right? 














 That one is sheer masterpiece of the form and fortunately it's can be found in high quality, making it a great one to introduce someone who might like horror or Sci-fi, but has never listened to OTR.  




 On the other hand, if the big timber companies had a big lay-off, it would cost a lot in unemployment checks, but only until they ran out. Sometimes protectionist policies cost us more in the long run than they save us in the short term.

 According to this, Mitt Romney still has a better shot than Elizabeth Warren? 




 I guess he figures that if all americans went to a tent revivals, found Jesus and became an evangelicals, we could just have a theocracy and wouldn't need a separation of church and state?    




 This woman has never even so much as served on a local school board or a city council, but thinks she is qualified to be leader of the free world? 




 With 150 bodies, 600 body parts would be 4 body parts per person. 




 So is the NYPost admitting that Google dictates what they print or admitting that they aren't news? 




 So you're asking how you can get deeper into an echo chamber   not have your ideological beliefs challenged by an outside narrative? 




 Ted Cruz may be trailing in something that kinda, sorta matters, but hes winning big in something that means jack-squat. 




 And he can tell his many pen-pals your address.  




 And it's not like they were even complicated bass lines. 









 People with "White collar jobs" don't usually get "welfare, Food Stamps and free health care".
 




 Double plus bad for Winston, it's Room 101 for him for not throwing that clip down the memory hole. 









 I don't support the Death Penalty, but there is no way that being shot in the head, at close range by a professional marksman is less humane than being a guinea pig.    




 Funny how there is no mention of how many of them are murderers or rapist, like percentages, just that some of them are. You could be considered a criminal alien just for speeding or driving without a licence.    














 You're paying your own way and not receiving a handout?  




 Several candidates are claiming that they'll dismantle Obamacare on day one if elected, for purely ideological reasons, despite the fact that it's lowering the deficit. I would call that relevant.    




 If what you say is true, then no one at WND, Townhall or American Thinker is a Conservative. 














 Jeff Beck does use anything but his thumb. 




 

From the actual poll

For each of the following pairs of statements, tell me which one
better describes your perfect candidate, even if neither is exactly right. 

The candidate shares your views on all major issues 51%

The candidate may not share all of your views on major issues, but
belongs to the party you prefer and has a good chance of winning 47%

No opinion 3%  




 And there we have it Ladies and Gentlemen, proof that the GOP really is racist. 









 Thus whites aren't at any significant threat from blacks who mostly live in different neighbourhoods and mostly self victimize one another?  

Which raises the question, why do you care what the percentage of crimes committed by blacks are, if it's mostly black on black crime?

Are you a black Democrat?   




 Betteridge's law of headlines is an adage that states: "Any headline that ends in a question mark can be answered by the word no."  The reason why journalists use that style of headline is that they know the story is probably bullshit, and dont actually have the sources and facts to back it up, but still want to run it.
