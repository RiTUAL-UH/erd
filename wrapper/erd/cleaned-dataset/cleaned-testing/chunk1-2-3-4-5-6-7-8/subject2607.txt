 My name is Anna Smith and I always get Anna Nicole Smith jokes. "Is your middle name Nicole???" No. It's not. 









 "In My Life" has been one of my favorite songs my whole life because I grew up on Beatles. Then my dad passed away when I was 13 and they played that at his funeral and it was the sweetest thing ever. Especially because he got me into The Beatles. It still makes me think of him to this day and that's why I still love the song so much. 




 My dad used to send me these for the few birthdays of mine that he spent in prison. They were all really cute, my favorite was a Super Mario Brothers one. The artwork was exactly the same too, I would think it was made by the same guy. 




 I didn't tell my dad he loved him a week before he OD'd and the last time I talked to him. That's the only time I didn't after a phone call. I was with my friends and thought I was too cool to talk to him. 









 In 8th grade I went all winter without wearing an actual winter coat once. I just wore hoodies. And I walked a mile and a half home from school everyday. AND I live in Michigan. 




 I'm like 3 minutes in to it right now. What am I watching. 




 My high school marching band is playing How Far We've Come for our halftime show and we came up with this really funny dance to it. Not really a question just though I would tell you. I LOVE your music. 




 Well yeah. Our reputation is crap too, I'm sure. :P 




 Yeah I live in Waterford if you know where that is so our reputation isn't much better 




 I live really close to Bloomfield Hills and you guys are known as being really stuck up and pretentious. Not that it's anything near as bad as what Mitt Romney is. Where I live is probably considered really ghetto and/or redneck so. 




 Heh. I get it. I'm gonna message you now. Yeah. 




 Little bit, little bit. This is why we can't have nice things. 




 I actually had a suspicion that you were MY friend Jimmy. But I wasn't sure.  http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/200/296/Waht%20a%20twist.jpg 




 I'm sorry bro *virtual hugs* That's gotta suck. We both kinda sound like we're in the same boat. This guy asked out a girl about 2 or 3 weeks ago and she dumped him after twelve hours and to my knowledge, he's still single. The fact that she dumped him so fast kinda made me smile. Karma, ya know? I'd be a lot less upset with him if he didn't completely cut me off after he promised he didn't want to hurt me but he had to do it because he felt he would have ended up hurting me by the time even worse if we had kept dating. Which sounded like bull to me. and we could be friends. Really, whenever I tried to make things right or talk to him he ignored me and recently deleted me off Facebook. He also kissed another girl near the end of our relationship because they were both going through hard times but he said it didn't mean anything and I didn't find out til about 2 days after our breakup. Sorry I didn't mean to turn that into a rant. But message me sometime dude.3 Feel better. 




 I like to put my iPod on shuffle, recline my seat a little bit, and lay there with my eyes closed and listen to my iPod for hours, or until I fall asleep. I make this rule for myself where I can't skip any songs and I have to listen really hard to the music that is playing. 




 Mr. Blue Sky - Electric Light Orchestra

Drive - Incubus

With a Little Help From My Friends - The Beatles 




 You sound like the coolest guy ever though omfg marry me right here, right now. 




 I wish I knew this going into my last relationship. Really. My SO and I broke up well over a month ago and I'm still so upset about it, and he already moved on. 




 Oh god... 




 I just saw him Wednesday near Detroit and it was great. He's touring with Christina Perri and she is great as well. They're both awesome live and have great stage presence. Jason is very friendly. You'll have a great time. Any questions just ask (: 




 I actually still braid my hair before bed in two braids so it looks kinda of crimped to be honest 




 Haha, I'll drop you a message sometime! :) 




 No. But we did go extremely far on multiple occasions. I'm not gonna say details but it's not much better .-. 




 Thanks! Every week I'm better than I was the week before. So I'm definitely feeling so much better than I did to begin with and I've moved on quite a bit. And yeah you shouldn't pressure anyone for sex. It just ruins things. Wait until you're ready. c: 




 Crappy music in general. I have a "Disney channel stars" station on my Pandora Radio that I listen to regularly... 




 One of my teachers had a big piece of wood shaped like a bass and painted really nicely and it said "Bathroom bass" on it, like "Bathroom Pass" I thought it was kinda cute 




 Yeah I know. I'm not proud. I know it's not an excuse but I was pressured. And the thing is he promised we'd still be friends and that he didn't want to hurt me. Yet he ignores all communication I try to make with him and deleted me off facebook the other day. ;-; 




 How physically far I went with my ex boyfriend. He was my first real relationship and I thought it would last but he dumped me out of he blue one day and moved on while I was still at home crying and listening to Taylor Swift. If I could go back to that day I would have stopped right when it started getting out of hand. 




 I have never liked a guy that wasn't a huge nerd. Really, like I could never date a guy that wasn't nerdy. I have a thing for glasses and curly hair too. And not the "hot nerd" the "nerd nerd" 




 This reminds me of a time me, my mom, and my grandmother were at Disney World. I was about 11 at the time and we were on one of the Disney busses and we were sitting across from two twin boys who were maybe about six or seven years old. They were being obnoxious and screaming and acting like idiots, and at the exact same time me and my grandmother went "SHHH!!!" The kids were dead silent the rest of the ride. 




 My school's marching band is doing How Far We've Come, Yesterday, and Thnks fr the mmrs for the half time show 




 Reversing roles for me. Trying to be friends with ex-BF. Not going well for me. 




 That's exactly what I said. He kissed another girl. They were both having rough times. It was an impulse. I can forgive him. But I'm never gonna forget what he did and how much it hurt me. 




 Wow. Thank you. Really. I'll definitely try that. I guess that's all I need. Some time away, just to act a little reckless. Again, thank you bro. Really helpful. c: 




 My favorite member is probably Paul, because he's extremely talented and I think he has an amazing personality. My favorite album is a hard one, but I have to say Rubber Soul. My favorite Song is In My Life because it brings back a lot of fond memories of my father who passed away last year. My favorite singer is John. I love the Beatles because their music is incredible and they had a huge impact on music history. The Beatles are who I turn to when there's no one else. They're just unbelievable. 




 Why? Just why? Who honestly thought this would be a good idea? 




 I actually really like the smell of skunk. I also love the smell of gasoline and smoke though, so people think I'm weird for that. 




 Thank you c: This is really nice and some of the best advice I've gotten. I have a best friend that has been there through the whole thing but I'm sure she's getting tired of hearing about it. Lol :P 




 I'm 14 years old and one month ago Saturday, my boyfriend (also 14) broke up with me. He said that he was under a lot of stress and was having family issues and that he didn't want to break up with me but he had to because he didn't want to end up hurting me. When he broke up with me, the both of us were just sobbing. Then fast forward about 3 days. I found out he kissed another girl who was raped recently while he was still with me. When I asked him about it, he said that I deserved to know the truth and he did but they were talking about what happened to her and they kissed without thinking, and he has no feelings for her and isn't dating her. I haven't tried talking to him since then and he hasn't tried talking to me, but today I broke and sent him a message on Facebook. It said "Hey, I know you're probably not really wanting to hear from me and idk if you're upset with me or anything but I've been kinda worried about you because of how you were last time we talked, and I just wanted to make sure you were okay. Are things going any better for you at all? /:" He didn't reply yet, but he hasn't been online and I just sent it about 5 hours ago. I was in tears for about the first week of our breakup, then the next two I was fine, and now I'm in pieces again. I saw a picture of him on facebook and legitimately started crying. This boy was my first kiss and my first real boyfriend. We went extremely far physically which is something I'm not proud of, but it's the past. We are going to different high schools this year as well, so I won't be able to see him during school either. I just miss him so much. I keep having dreams that I see him somewhere, and we make up, and everything is back to how it used to be. I just feel like I'm never going to get better. The only thing I want right now is to be able to see him and talk about things. I just need so much closure right now and I just want us to get back together and I want things to be how they used to be. I miss his smile, I miss cuddling with him while we listened to music, I miss Facetiming with him every single day for hours and hours. Reddit, how do I get over it? And should I keep trying to talk to him or should I back off? Thanks.

EDIT: Yeah. He didn't reply to my facebook message. It said that he saw it, but no reply. 




 DFW he says you can still be friends yet makes no effort to talk to you.  




 The reason my ex boyfriend kissed another girl during our relationship is because I was an OAG and even though he insists it wasn't my fault I will always know it was because I wouldn't give him space and assumed the whole relationship would be very long-term. 




 I actually love this. You have a pretty unique and cool sound. Keep it up. 




 Bill, I'm 14 years old and you are the reason I have so much passion for science. I want to major in physics some day. Thank you, you have made such a difference in my life. I probably never would have cared about science otherwise and never would have realized how cool it is. But my question is, what were you like as a teenager?

 I heard this song at the Apple store a while ago. I was trying the headphones on an iPod and this happened to be the song I chose. Been into it ever since. 




 This freaking song. Definitely my favorite on the album, kind of hard to listen to right now though because I just went through a rough breakup and he and I used to listen to this song together all the time. 




 I still read it as Jared until you pointed it out and was really creeped out as to why they would name it. 




 My username is relevant to this post. :'( 









 Oh my gosh, me too. I thought I was the only one. Mine don't sound nearly as strong as yours, but the word "fluffy" I'll think of a little retriever. For verbs I get a still image of someone doing the verb. For whatever reason, a lot of these images are cartoony and look a lot like clip-art. 




 Yes. But it depends on where I'm at and what's going on in my life. At the moment I gotta say it's Always Be My Baby (The David Cook version, I'm not a fan of Mariah Carey). I know that my boyfriend and I are more than likely going to end soon and I can't accept it. That song is describing my feelings down to every last word. 









 My cat was originally Mr. Kitty then we figured out it was a girl and it turned into Ms. Kitty and now it's just Kitty. :3 




 How is Qdoba actually pronounced? I know it's a dumb question but my mom and I were arguing about it. 




 I know that feel. My dog will run up and down the hallway and growl and bark at my grandfather's urn. And this is normally and extremely quiet dog. 









 I don't spend my 4th of July downstate but I'm in Waterford and I heard we have a pretty good fireworks show, but Lake Orion has a very nice one as well. If you're willing to travel I always go to one in East Tawas, it's about a 2 and a half hour drive. It's very nice, bright fireworks on Lake Huron. 




 I have glasses because I'm farsighted. I'm supposed to wear them all the time but I wear them occasionally during the evening while I'm reading or on the internet. I want contacts but I have to wait a little while to get the money. I just don't wear them all the time because I think they make me look extremely nerdy and I don't like them, so I know it's my fault. But my question is, how much worse can my vision get from not wearing them? Scare me into wearing them more often because I know I need to and would if I knew the risks of not wearing them.

 I actually like writing essays. Too bad I live in Michigan. I write essays in my spare time, come on Tigers. 




 Wow. This is gorgeous. I need to visit here sometime. 




 They can't be comprehended by the human mind. 




 "INTO THE DOME MOTHERFUCKER!"

Jesus Christ I have tears. 









 I actually should have called it Lake Huron, Ontario. I said Michigan because that's where I live and I'm used to it I guess. XD Sorry, broski 




 It is. I don't know why I put Michigan in the title. Probably because I live in Michigan. My bad, brethren. 









 I read "Found this baby" and I was instantly concerned. 





























 I'm considering getting a snake or a bearded dragon, but I have no idea where to start. I already have a cat and a small dog (who probably wouldn't care that much), and my cat will try to attack everything that moves. I'm surprised she hasn't gotten any of my fish yet, so my cat is a concern. I don't want to get anything that my cat could potentially harm. I'm sure I could find a weight or something to put on the cage, but I'd still worry. Anyhow, I live in a condo and I am gone for school everyday during the school year and my mom works. Our family also goes upstate a lot, sometimes for about a week at a time, so I would need something that would either be able to travel or that would be able to be alone for a few days. So I suppose my question is, what would be better for my situation: a snake or a bearded dragon? Also, if anyone recommends a snake, what kind? Any information at all would be appreciated, because I have no idea where to start. Thanks!3   




 Hell yeah3 




 I can't pick just one, but Knockin' on Heaven's door by Bob Dylan is in my top 3. It was played at my father's funeral, who was a huge Bob Dylan fan, and that makes it even sadder for me. 




 Thanks!

 This is why my mother refused to talk "baby talk" to me as a baby. I was also talking in full sentences substantially faster than most babies, whether or not that has anything to do with it. 




 I absolutely love McCrae and have a giant obsession/crush on him tbh. I actually got really jealous about he and Amanda and I realized I needed to take a step back and reevaluate the fact that I'm getting jealous about a man I will never meet and has no idea who I am. Oh my god. 




 God this is gorgeous. I love living in Michigan. I never want to leave. 




 Yeah at this point it should pretty much be underwater-ford 




 Waterford. Represent! 




 Just finished that book, my immediate thought as well 




 You're welcome(: 




 D'aww you're a cutie :3 




 Woo! Message me!(: 




 Hell yeah! 




 Trombone!3 




 You get me. 




 I have been playing guitar for about 3 years, since I was 12. I started trombone in October, and I've played euphonium/baritone since I was 11. I love music, I swear sometimes it's the thing that keeps me sane. 









 As weird as it sounds, I LOVE your eyebrows. 




 http://imgur.com/upsFs0L

The top one was from when I was two, circa 2000, and the other two are from now, 10th grade. I was a cutie :3 (btw excuse the no makeup but yeah) 




 Ouch. I take it you guys are competitive. We don't technically compete, except for at certain parades and invitationals. 




 Depending on how much we need to work on, usually 2-5 hours. Most of the time it's about 3. 5 hour practices only happen about once or twice a season. 




 True that. 




 Before camp it's at 10 am, after camp it's 1 pm, during the school year it's 6:30 pm 




 I still have school tomorrow :( my internal clock wakes me up at 6, then right when I can start sleeping in, marching band starts. The struggle. 




 That is a good point. I guess I'm just really bitter about them considering selling it. 




 If the city does end up selling that art, I'm going to be so pissed off you have no idea. We all know that if they were to end up getting the money from selling the paintings, then in five years they're going to end up exactly where they are now, unless drastic changes occur  within the city council. 




 You could actually almost put this on r/creepy 




 I love the acoustic version so damn much.

 This is it, thanks! 




 I'm late, but I got a rather amazing boyfriend ;3 




 I watched a movie on Netflix a while back, and I just thought about it today. I can't remember for the life of me what it was called. It was about a guy who was a high school teacher or coach or something (if I'm not mistaken) and he has a very sarcastic son. I can't remember why, but the son ends up killing himself and his dad starts going crazy, and I remember at the end he saw his son hanging in the hallway. Sorry for the convoluted description, that's all I remember of it. Thanks!  




 http://imgur.com/vOq5BSr I'm the one on the right, I promise my teeth aren't really that yellow, just the lighting ;-; 




 You're adorable awwh 




 Same problem. I haven't had mine since around November or December. No one seems concerned and say that it's normal. THAT IS NOT FUCKING NORMAL. 




 Well he's really mean in a funny way, and he said that I should STOP breathing. Like all together. XD 




 I'm in segment 1. In Michigan you can start it at 14 and 9 months. 









 Check this website: http://zenpencils.com/ It's very possible, because the art style and context sounds similar to these. 




 Oh my gosh. The other day my high school had a girls lacrosse game against a school in Detroit, we encountered so many girls like this. They pretty much beat us with their sticks too. 




 I do water then paste, and no water on top. Maybe I'm too stupid to brush my teeth but when I do it the other way, the toothpaste all globs off. 




 I'm from Michigan and I definitely suggest filming in Alpena, especially on Long Lake. Parts of the town are gorgeous. 




 And then that cover is the only one you can find at wherever you buy it from and you look like an asswagon carrying it around? Yeah. The Hobbit and The Perks of Being a Wallflower. 




 I still wear acid wash jeans. I love them. 




 It's Franklin Press, not worth a whole lot. Oh well. 




 Ah, that's mildly disappointing. I'll check when I get home tomorrow. 




 I'll check tomorrow when I get home. :) 




 Will do tomorrow 




 Oh my gosh. Will do tomorrow when I get home. 









 Yup .-. 




 And there's the time she referred to my cousin's year-old brother to her "boyfriend" for months 




 Not super exciting, but I was walking with my friend who had bright orange shoelaces, and Charquise stalks up behind us and screams "GIRL DEM SHOELACES ARE CUUUUTE!" and did this snapping thing with her hands and her posse high-fives her 




 It's like "Shar-queece" and she used to put liquid lip gloss on as eye shadow and tried way too hard with everything she did oh my god 




 OH MY GOD THIS IS CHARQUISE I AM CRYING HOW DO YOU KNOW HER. She dated my cousin and was talking about how much she hated white girls right in front of me and was like, "Oh gurl you black in my eyes" I have so many Charquise stories who are you oh my god 




 Agh, I don't think this was it, thank you though! 




 I don't remember what site it was on. I played it maybe 4 or 5 years ago and I still remember it for some reason and would love to play it again. If I remember correctly, you were a guy who was trying to stop these guys from robbing a bank. It was a really silly point and click adventure type game. I don't think the art was very good either, it was a bit ms paint-ish. I remember a gas station and the cashier was a hispanic woman I think. The town was a bit ghetto. I don't remember much about it at all. If anyone has any clue what it is, let me know please. 




 I'm pretty sure this is supposed to be making fun of Ketan Vora 




 Ahah, no he's my friend's younger brother 









 Just out of curiosity, is this guy's name Taylor? He reminds me a LOT of someone I know. 




 I've been listening to this album quite a bit. DAE find it kind of cool how the end of World at Large kind of spills into Float On? 




 There's a hill behind Durant High School in Waterford that's pretty good. I'm sure there are better but I sled there a lot. 
























 I've been trying to, and I think it's actually helping. 




 Wow thank you a+ you win 




 Hello, I need help figuring out how to become more social. I know that lots of people just aren't social and that's okay, but it sucks always feeling left out because I'm too scared to talk to anyone. I'm a 15 year old girl, and even from a young age I've never been able to talk to other kids. I have a few really close friends that I can talk to easily, but with everyone else, it's a lost cause. Sometimes when I really want to say something to someone that I don't know well, I'll count to 10 and say it, but it always comes out in awkward stutters. I think my problem is that people will think I'm weird or they don't like me. Online, I'm able to talk to you guys super easily, but if we were face-to-face it would be all kinds of awkward. I know that everyone thinks I'm really nerdy, because I'm in marching band and get really good grades. Even in marching band though, I can only talk to a select few people. I always feel left out from the group, and it kind of sucks, because everyone else is so close. Do you guys have any tips that could help me with my social awkwardness? Because I can't take it anymore. 




 Woo!

 I know, it just sucks feeling like the weird ugly friend 




 Yes, my best friend in the world is beautiful, lost about 75 pounds, always has guys all over her, has been in a relationship for almost 2 years, and is really good at making friends. I feel so inferior around her. 




 Thank you!

 Awh sure 3 pm me? :) 




 Just a rough break up 




 Jesus Christ  




 We don't really compete, we just do football games and invitationals and festival. We got a 1 at festival though so that's good 




 Euph in concert and marching band, and trombone in jazz  




 I'm Anna, and I need more friends. I like kittens, puppies, music, and sleeping. I play euphonium and trombone in band, and you should pm me c: 




 WOW WHO ARE YOU 




 Sounds fun :3 I'm Anna, I'm 15, from Michigan, a sophomore in high school, had a shitty day, and I enjoy marching band, cats, puppies, and not leaving the house all weekend. 




 You're in marching band so you're automatically perfect tbh 




 I want a watercolor tattoo. I think something abstract would be cool. I'd like it on my wrist, shoulder, or shoulder blade. 




 This made me cringe more than the actual post 




 They do, they're so loyal and I love the energy at the games. 




 Waterford resident  




 So do I. I joke about it too but it gets old when people constantly tell you about how much it sucks where you live when they've never even been there. 




 I messaged you 




 They're gorgeous but they have a lot of problems. The middle clave on mine is really sticky and gets jammed a lot and everyone in my section has at least one major issue with theirs. I'll message you though since I feel like we're spamming this post haha 




 Really? That's funny. How come you're jealous of our euphs? 




 OH MY GOD YOU GUYS ARE GREAT. We were at your invitational last month and you were fantastic and I'm so jealous. What do you play? 




 Yup! Are you in a Michigan band? 




 Band: Waterford Kettering Marching Captains

Instrument: Euphonium

Show Name: Music Royale

Repertoire: Bicycle Race by Queen, Hit the Road Jack by Ray Charles, King Kong by Jimmy Castor, Hall of the Mountain King

Unfortunately, as you can probably tell, we don't compete and we're a show band. We just go to invitationals, festivals, and play at parades and football games. We are a very good band though. Straight 1's at festival for the past three years, we got first place from 150 bands at the Mackinaw City memorial day parade, and we're going to be in the Detroit Thanksgiving Day Parade on national television. Last time we went there we got first. I wish we competed though tbh. 




 Well I don't blame him for getting mad at the professor if he was unprofessional when the question was asked. Of course the slurs weren't necessary but this honestly isn't that cringey 




 My boyfriend has one of these. The damn thing makes me so uncomfortable. 




 There were a bunch of teenage girls doing this exact same thing at the Jason Mraz concert I went to 




 My boyfriend has a body pillow of a female anime character (I have no idea which one) and damn that thing makes me uncomfortable.  




 He said "I'm glad the bitch is dead." 




 Shit like this kind of makes me ashamed to be a feminist 




 What the hell? 




 My best friend's sister is at Grand Valley State and was actually doing this last night... AND took Facebook pictures 




 I don't know why you're getting down voted... 




 Sometimes I hate my state. 




 Yup, that's it! Thank you! 









 Well I don't know what I expected. 




 Air bags are so dangerous. My mom is 4'11 and she would get so injured if the airbag came out. It makes me so worried. 




 Idek I actually really like that family 









 Wow that actually made me really sad. I've had a crush on McCrae since day 1 tbh 




 I honestly would love to see McCrae win veto. He could be such a strong player if it weren't for Amanda. 




 Agreed. 




 Did he really? He blocked me because he threatened suicide for like the 5th time, and I knew he was bluffing, so I messaged his aunt and he hates me now 




 OMG IS THIS ALEX PLEASE TELL ME IT IS I HAVE SO MANY STORIES ABOUT HIM 




 Oh my gosh I'm in Michigan too, and this year at the senior walk out in my school, and there was a group of like 5 kids all walking together in all camo, head to toe, and mumbling in fake southern accents. 




 Nah, just some parts. 




 ^ Same 




 That fact wasn't fun at all! 




 Who said the original quote?  




 I saw a kid do that in elementary school. He just got really bad whiplash. 




 So do I. Flint scares me tbh. 




 Wow that sounds like me in about 8th grade. Really that's creepy as hell, they even got the name, state, and "OMG CATSSS" right. Fuck. 




 Heaven forbid they aren't a Greek god! 




 As a large-ish girl who goes on Tumblr, this is true. Half the girls on there annoy me so much because they are so picky with guys, and when I say that I prefer chubby guys, some of my friends on tumblr act so confused. Because according to them, all kinds of guys are required to like all kinds of girls and have no say in it, but it's okay for them to talk about how gross bigger guys are. Some girls on there are so shallow, it's crazy. 




 Lua - Bright Eyes 




 I will definitely check it out. I know what you mean when you talk about things that speak to you. It sounds great, and like it would help me a lot. Thank you so much for the suggestion. 




 That made me happy to read, you sound wonderful. Of course you can feel free to PM me anytime you want. It would be great to have a friend to relate to in that way, because I don't have any of those. Thank you for reading about me, and feel free to PM me. 




 That's exactly how I've been trying to handle it. I've accepted the fact that I'm not over him, but I don't let my friends say bad things about him anymore. I just try not to think about it. He goes to the other high school in my district, so I only see him occasionally at marching band competitions and invitationals. He told my friend that he wanted to get back together with me, but I realized that he would hurt me like that again, so I just didn't talk to him. But I definitely have been moving on and thinking about other guys, and that has helped me. It was rough, but it is getting a lot better. Thank you. 




 I am a teenage girl who has been dealing with depression and anxiety for about a year and a half. Cutting and suicidal thoughts are things I had issues with for a long time. Before I tell my story, I want to say that finding this, and looking at some of the posts, made me feel less alone. Feeling alone is all too familiar to everyone on this subreddit, and it's amazing that a group of people who are feeling the same things and battling the same things can come together to discuss and guide each other. That's beautiful.

Now for the my story. As a young child, I never fit in. I was always the weird fat girl, and living in a wealthy town full of girls with entitlement issues  didn't help. My mother is very down to Earth, and since it was only her and I living together, we didn't have much money. We were by no means poor, but I didn't live in a fancy house in a nice subdivision, nor did I wear designer brand clothes like all the other kids. My parents divorced when I was two, and my dad was in and out of prison. With all of this being said, I spent most of my time alone and playing by myself when I was little. I had no siblings and no friends to play with. 

Then when I was 10 or 11, about to start middle school, my mother made a spur of the moment decision to move to a town about 10 or 20 miles outside the one we were living in. I was not excited. There were some bad areas of the town, and it intimidated me. My mom tried to assure me that I'd make lots of new friends and that everyone would be nicer. I didn't believe her, because I believed that kids were mean, and that's just how it was. I had no idea that there really were nice kids out there. I started middle school and everything was well, and I was amazed when I wasn't made fun of on the first day. I was very introverted, and didn't have any friends until about halfway through the school year, when I started taking to Jessie, a beautiful trumpet player in my band class who I though was extremely cool. I am still friends with her today, and I met most of my other friends though the people that Jessie knew in elementary school. 6th and 7th grade were good, and while I wasn't popular, and was still "the weird fat girl" in some people's eyes, I had a group of friends that I loved. I was content. 

Then the summer before 8th grade, my father passed away due to a prescription drug overdose. I tried to avoid it, and pretend that it never happened, which only fueled my mourning. My father wasn't perfect, and there were points where I would only see him two or three times a year, but he loved me. He adored me. In the letters he sent to my the rest of my family, he never shut up about me. The thing that hurt me the most is that the last the we talked was on the phone, and I didn't tell him I loved him. As with all deaths, I mourned and then gradually moved on with my life. When 8th grade started, all was well, and I still had the same group of friends.

About halfway through the year, I developed a crush on a close friend, Brandon. He also came from a broken home, with a dead mother, an abusive father, and being in his grandparents' custody with his older brother. I told him, and in early March we started dating. I loved this boy. He was my first boyfriend, first kiss, and first everything. Being the naive young kid I was, we had sex. Because hey, if he's willing to have sex with me, that must mean he really loves me right? Well as you would expect, he broke up with me shortly afterwards, after coming on a vacation with my family and I for my birthday. About a week after my birthday, he randomly became very distant and would only talk to me briefly once every few days, where we used to FaceTime for hours and hours every day. Then one day I sent him a message and asked what was wrong, and after a short argument, he called me on FaceTime. He said he had to break up with me to "protect me" and we were both sobbing. I didn't hear from him for over a year. 

In all honesty, I never really got over him. I still have dreams about him on a nightly basis, and I think he was the thing that really fueled my depression. For once in my life, I felt a mutual love with one of my peers, and then it was gone. I now realize the he used me, and he was very controlling, but I loved him.  I spent weeks and weeks crying over the breakup, but of course, I started getting over it slowly but surely. That was my first experience with cutting. I was sad, and mad at myself, so I grabbed the dull knife from the kitchen and sawed at my arm until there was a swollen cut, with blood oozing out. It felt good. The physical pain distracted me from the mental pain, and for those moments, it relieved my stress. 

Through freshman year, cutting was an issue. I continued to earn good grades and smile, but in marching band, a close-knit group of friends, I felt like an outsider. Jessie made new upperclassmen friends, and I was the awkward weird girl who wouldn't talk to anyone. It got really bad in the winter, and those are when the thoughts got more hostile and I felt more alone. I began more and more to sit in my room alone and listen to music, and avoid everyone around me. It was the same routine at this point: wake up, go to school or pretend I was sick, then lay and bed and sulk. I began becoming anorexic, not eating for a couple days at a time. I have since gotten better with eating, although the thought still rises occasionally. I was put on Zoloft when I was 14 as well as attended therapy, and it helped for a while, but now I am falling back into that pit of loneliness. We quit therapy a few months ago because it became too much money for my mom to handle.

Being a teenager, I like to tell myself this is a phase, or a mere hormone imbalance, but at this point I know it's not. Nothing seems beautiful, and I can find sadness and despondence in most everything. I can't shake the lonely, worthless feeling constantly plaguing me, and I needed to tell my story to people who would understand and point me in the right direction. I really feel less alone now, and I can relate to so many of you. Thank you for reading this, and I look forward to being a supportive part of this subreddit. 




 I bet! John Mayer is great. I saw Jason Mraz last summer, and that was fantastic as well. 




 Nah, he wasn't here that I know of. I'm in Michigan. Did you? 




 Yeah, that's what I was thinking. I was leaning towards getting a ball python. Thanks c: 




 I'll keep that in mind, thanks! 




 I love Harmony Korine so much. Maybe I'm just a pretentious asshole, but I absolutely loved Gummo. It was so unsettling, I loved it. 
























 At my high school last year a sophomore and his girlfriend had sex in the sound booth in the back of the auditorium during the middle of an orchestra concert 




 I'm a teenage girl, band nerd, animal lover. Sometimes I'm funny idk pm me if boys 




 You too! Good luck sista! 




 Cool cool, I do too but I doubt it'll happen too haha 




 I play trombone and euph, you?

 I realized how replaceable I am. Every one of my past boyfriends has gotten a new girlfriend within 2 weeks of breaking up with me or me breaking up with them. They'll act devastated and like it's the end of the world, but then just forget about me. And it's really ruining my self esteem, you know? 




 "You can go lay back down" to my dog who woke up to follow me around the house 




 And I like driving home with one headlight holla 




 I'm Anna, I'm from Michigan, and I'm in marching band and my school's robotics team. I need to meet new people so message me :3 my hobbies include talking about my pets behind their backs and sleeping 




 Low brass is obviously superior 




 Me too.. 




 My best friend's dad was an all star QB on the Michigan State football team. He got a master's in general math and a couple other maths and sciences. He is now working for a lawncare company and makes about 40k a year. 




 Ah /: And I'm in Michigan where the winters are really harsh. I just kinda want it short because it would be easier to handle and the back of my hair is pretty much fried beyond repair. 




 Lol, that's one of the best parts! 




 Oh my gosh. I am in LOVE with the first one you sent me, it's adorable (and would be so much easier to handle lol) Thanks dude! 




 I like that too, and I feel like it wouldn't look horrible if I got too lazy to straighten it lol 




 I'm getting a haircut in a couple hours, and I am going to have to get it short due to really burned hair in the back of my head, and I'll probably need it thinned out a bit. I kind of want shorter hair anyway because right now I'm getting bored with my plain haircut. I need to hear suggestions from you guys because I don't know how short or in what style or color I want. It will be difficult to decide because I have a round face which tends to not look super great with short hair. Here's a picture for reference: imgur.com/lLiTVM9 




 Hey I have that sweater 




 EVERY SINGLE DAY. 




 I've thought about this before. I would take a bus or a train to Chicago, and try to find a cheap apartment, and make a fake ID if I had to, and get a job wherever I could, and I could just live happily by myself.

 Now St. Claire is kicking our asses which sucks because we're the only band that did visuals so 




 Thank you! I just finished. It was rather hellish but ya know  




 My marching band will be in the Thanksgiving Day Parade in Detroit, and it would mean the world to us if we won first place. If you have a minute, please go on clickondetroit.com and vote for Waterford Kettering in the side bar for the battle of the bands. We worked really hard on visuals and it would be amazing if we won first place. Thank you so much 3 




 I tried this and kinda liked it tbh, it didn't sting for me... 




 Thanks dude 




 Oh my God, I'll be there. My poor penguin has been neglected for years.

 My jack russell terrier mix also has that, but she doesn't gain a whole lot of weight from it, she's just a bit chubby. She has more of the problem with shaking and always being thirsty.

 "Be a brave woman!" Lol easier said than done ;P But sometimes he sits with a couple other people and they simultaneously listen to music or read and I vaguely know one of them so I might just say one day that I didn't feel like sitting with my other friends and he's the only other person in my lunch that I really know. That sounds like a decent plan but omg I'm already stressing out  




 That's so bold but omg I love it. 




 thanks riley you're great xox 




 10/10 WOULD SMILE AT. Rly tho I really wanna sit by him at lunch but it'll take a lot of courage tbh 




 I'm very introverted too, and I really like that picture. I've seen it but I read it pretty often because it reminds me of a lot of things. But someday I', gonna force myself to work up the courage to do that. 




 is it wrong i'm tempted? 




 yes i like this 









 Not with that attitude! 




 That's true, I'll ask them about it next time I see them. 




 I didn't live just with him, I lived with him and my mom until I was 3, then I saw him a few times a year and talked to him on the phone a lot because he had legal issues, but then when I turned about 11, I saw him almost every day and was with him a lot of the time. He passed away two years ago right when I turned 13. So I don't know. I'd be nervous to talk to my psychiatrist about it because I don't want to sound like one of those melodramatic teenage girls that think they have bipolar disorder, even though they're just hormones. 




 I might, I have a follow up for them in a couple weeks. I used to have a therapist but I don't go anymore because it was so expensive and I hated going. And I'm not sure, it's possible, because my dad had really severe bipolar disorder. My mom is concerned that I do, but they usually don't diagnose teenagers with it. 




 Are those song lyrics? Because wow that was adorable. Can I message you? Cuz let's be friends. I feel like you're someone I could talk to. 




 That's actually really amazing tbh 




 That made me really happy... 




 Most of my friends have aspergers actually, so don't feel bad. People who have it are actually very interesting. But I'm already on antidepressants for other reasons and they don't help much with my social issues, they just make me feel happier in general, and when I take them I have more motivation. But unfortunately, I'm still just as awkward. But thank you. 




 I wish my school had more clubs, because I agree that it would help me a lot, I'm in band but there are so many people that it's a bit overwhelming, and I'd really like smaller groups or clubs. 




 That made me smile. 
























 Chemistry. I love chemistry to no end and our teacher's a lot of fun. Or band, I like band too because it's band. 




 [This](http://imgur.com/Wpt1g9J) always could make me crack up for some reason.

 Holy cow I love this picture. When I first glanced at the title, I thought it said "Detroit smuggles harder" and I rolled my eyes but then clicked on the picture and reread the title and I have one of my new favorite posts, I love this a lot 




 THIS IS THE FIRST THING ON THIS SUB TO MAKE ME VERBALLY SAY "AWW" IN A LONG TIME OH MY GOD I CAN'T HANDLE THIS 




 I LOVE this kind of pixel art. I wish more game developers that tried to do pixel art didn't do a horrible job at it. 




 Orange juice, I'd rather not feel like I'm drinking piss with a bunch of sugar in it 




 It's like, the love/hate relationship you have with your best friend. You jokingly tell them they're horrible and you hate them but you actually love them a lot. 




 Because we hate the same things and we can act like lesbians together. Also she's gross and horrible and I hate her but she's my best friend and I love her so much 




 "Sorry I love my family" oh my god 




 I was actually discussing with my friend whether or not that happened yet. I guess my question is answered. Oh jeez. 




 Not only do I hate the taste, I hate the feeling of being intoxicated. I was with 2 friends last summer and we decided to get drunk (it was my first time drinking, not theirs) and I HATED being drunk. I could just feel things spill out of my mouth and I cried and lost control of myself and it's one of the worst things I've ever felt. So, yeah. Never again. 




 July 3rd. Overshadowed by fireworks and hot dogs every year. Sigh. 




 Landlocked Blues - Bright Eyes 




 It's been ENDLESS Brand New and Bright Eyes and Bob Dylan lately. 




 "Goodnight. You have scary friends, for the record" 




 Mm, just stay up all day then you'll be able to sleep at like, 8 :D 




 Poison Oak by Bright Eyes. The entire song. Every single chord and lyric in that song can make me weep. Easily one of my top 5 favorites of all time. 




 My state championship robotics competition next weekend :) also I'm on spring break now so no school next week and sleeping until 2 pm 




 I'm sure it's pretty common. I've definitely done it a couple times. I know it's kind of a not super great thing to do, but we want you to realize you did something that upset us and we don't want to have to spell it out for you. It's kind of childish and unnecessary but I think most girls do it.  




 Oh yeah, I'm definitely working on it. A few weeks ago I was talking to my ex who I'm still on kinda good terms with, we were sort of talking about getting back together for a while. Then he was obviously upset at something and it was coming off as him being mad at me and I was trying so hard to pry it out of him and it ended up in a HUGE argument. So learned my lesson a bit there. 




 Yeah, honestly I need to get better at that. I ask people not to do that to me, but in a relationship if I can tell something is wrong it is so hard for me not to pry. I get worried it's about me, and I just don't like seeing my SO upset. So I will bug them and bug them and it actually drives a wedge in between friendships and stuff. I don't do it in a malicious or mean way, I'm just genuinely concerned and don't want my SO to be upset, but I just come on a little bit strong. 




 That's actually kind of condescending and would probably just make me more upset if I didn't want to talk. 




 The Promise - Reel Big Fish. One of my favorite covers of anything ever. It's right up with Iron and Wine's cover of Such Great Heights. 




 The beginning of that actually sounds so condescending tbb 




 I think I found one of my new favorite pictures. 




 Best of You - Foo Fighters 




 I know it's not something people can just "get over" because it's an actual personality trait. But I am really introverted and I feel like it holds me back a lot. Like, I'm in robotics and marching band and sometimes I feel so alone and like I'm an outcast, then I realize it's my own fault. I'm terrified to talk to people, and when I do it's incredibly awkward. I have friends that I can be myself around, but lately I've been pushing them all away. I never feel like hanging out or texting them. I just want to sit in my room alone and listen to music or read all the time, and I know that's not how I should be spending my time. I should be out having fun with my friends, but I just don't feel like it. I know I'll never be perfect at socializing and having friends, but I really need ways to stop the antisocial and extremely introverted tendencies I have. Does anyone have any advice? I'm so done with being alone all the time because I don't know how to socialize. 




 I'm a girl and about 5'5" and it's a pretty good height I think 




 annamarie225

I'm from michigan and i like dogs and self loathing and sleeping and robots and music.  









 Mostly B's. I lose so much motivation this time of year, and I usually hold myself to a really high standard and am usually a straight-A student. So I'm pretty down about that. 




 Oh I can't dance at ALL, but it was kind of fun when I was tripping over his feet and we laughed. Idk, that was one of my favorite parts tbh. P.S. It's okay I broke up with him 




 Brand New, Bon Iver, The Tallest Man on Earth, Neutral Milk Hotel, Bright Eyes, Bob Dylan, Panic at the Disco, Shigeto, Jason Mraz, and Paramore. I'm sure there are more that I'm forgetting, but that's a lot of them. 




 It depends on what she's into, but my (now ex) boyfriend wanted to take me to homecoming really badly this year but I was really opposed to it, as I hate big dances and large gatherings of hormone-filled teenagers in the same room. So we just agreed that we would go out for a nice dinner then go back to his house. He knew I always liked just cuddling on the couch watching a movie better than going out somewhere. Then when he drove me home from dinner he went in the house first and told me to wait a second and that he would text me when I could come in, because he had a surprise. Then when I came in there was this song playing that we always listened to together and he was wearing a nice suit and he just grabbed me and started dancing with me. It was super nice and made me feel like I wasn't missing out. If your girlfriend is into cheesy romantic stuff like that then she might like being surprised with her own little "mini-prom" from you. Really though, it takes the right kind of person to enjoy it. 




 I know this is said all the time, but I hate how when women sleep with lots of people, she's a slut. But when men sleep with lots of people, he's considered cool and his male peers think more highly of them a lot of the time. 




 Miley Cyrus, not gonna lie. 




 Ohh yeah, it was pretty bad. Me and a few other people on the team said it was because the wrong team was losing. But ah well, we ended up winning anyway, even though that was a pretty infuriating rematch, lol. By the way, we love 573 :3 3 




 That happened to us at Southfield! It's the worst feeling. 




 I can't even imagine that frustration, omg. 




 Did you end up replaying the match? 




 I wish I had a video of the lights coming loose. At the end of the day, the red alliance ended up winning, but at this point in finals we had one loss against a powerhouse alliance, and were pretty excited to have almost won, and I think the fact that we replayed it when there were 6 seconds left was a little bit unnecessary.  




 At the Waterford competition, during the second final match, [part of the LED strip came off of the high goal](http://www.flickr.com/photos/danielernst/13521802593/in/set-72157643084658745/) when the red alliance was ahead by a good 40 points, with **6 seconds** left on the clock. Understandably, they had to restart the match. Needless to say, we were all pretty mad. Has this happened anywhere else? 




 That actually looks a LOT like my ex boyfriend and I think it might be him... 




 I'm more of an algebra kinda gal 




 Sitting in geometry. Just took a test. Woo. 




 Jk I'm done being a freak now. What's up? 




 i am me. or am i you? who knows. maybe you aren't supposed to know. shhh. 




 ay what is u 




 That pretty much just made my day. 




 I didn't, I didn't watch the Grammys  




 Not gonna lie, I used to be on the bandwagon that she sucked, but I love her now to no end. 




 Really? That's one of my favorites on the album 




 annamarie225, 15/f

Books, marching band, movies, robotics, science, music 




 Oh he was terrified. It was fantastic. 




 And this all happened when he was in 8th grade and I was in 9th grade so he was telling all his friends that he was about to date a high schooler and thought he was hot shit oh my God. 




 My favorite is when my friend and I were sending each other creepy lyrics and I meant to send him "I SEE GOD IN BIRDS AND SATAN IN LONG WORDS" but I accidentally sent it to someone else with no context. 




 The one time they come to my state, it's $300. 




 This guy was also talking to me one time and he's like "I have a... you know what" and I legitimately didn't know, so he's like "Hold on" and printed out "BONER" on a sticker from his label maker. 




 There's this kid on my robotics team got the nickname Harry Pooter last year. That's not a typo. I don't know how he got it, but I don't like him so it doesn't matter. 




 I am. Trombone in jazz and euph in concert and marching :3 




 Well personally I'm against it. I had an ex who ended up in a coma and kept waking up for a few minutes at a time (it was bizarre, he was dead about 5 times). And every time he woke up, he said he wanted to die. He woke up for good, and he has some issues now but he's almost back to normal. When he was telling me about it, he said that if assisted suicide was an option, he would have jumped on it in a second just because he was in pain and was upset just at the time. He still has depression and isn't in the best state, but he isn't suicidal anymore. He said he's so glad that he didn't end up dying. Miracles like that happen. 




 Oh God is Funnyjunk still a thing? I thought it was a lot of fun when I was like 13 omfg 




 I was on Skype with this kid that liked me, and he was showing me this label maker he got and I'm like "Oh cool" and acted like I cared because he was really excited over this label maker. Then he called me back on Skype the next day and fucking everything in his room is covered in stickers of my name. Like, he must have printed out at least 250 stickers of my name. 




 Wounded Healer by Watsky 




 Try Watsky. My favorite from him is Wounded Healer. Too lazy to get a link 




 Well I was going to major in chemistry and minor in some kind of business or management. But chemistry is what I'm passionate about and my first business choice research or teaching. It's not like it's the only thing I'd learn. But I know what you mean, chemical engineering probably would be a better option. It's something I'll have to consider. 




 I'm currently a sophomore in high school, but if I play my cards right, I'll be able to graduate as a junior. I realized how much I needed to begin looking at colleges. I want to be a chemist for sure, so my mom told me that MTU is a good school for students studying the sciences, but I had it in my head that it was based mainly on engineering. MTU has been one of my top choices since I started researching colleges more, but my question is how much they focus on the sciences, mainly chemistry. Thank you! 




 Thank, I sure hope so! Lol 




 I'm a sophomore and just got my first college email. It was from Marquette university. It finally hot me I need to start actually thinking abut my future ;-; 
























 Saturday I think. Boys are frustrating and dumb. 




 Idk whenever I have guys over they always want to watch tv or a movie but like, is rather just sit there and talk to them. I'm sure it depends on the girl but she might just want to sit down and have a conversation with you. I'm a loser.

 June 13th 




 Gross one time I went to the movies with my best friend and her boyfriend because I'm a gigantic idiot and at one point I looked over and his hand was literally in her pants like calm down please this is public 




 Be prepared for "LET ME TRY OM YOIR GLASSES" and "LMAO HOW MANT FINGERS AM I HOLDING UP" and "WOW YOURE BLIND HAHAHA". Also from personal experience, "Thanks, I need them to see" isn't the way to respond when someone compliments your glasses. 




 The only other John Green book I've ever read was Looking for Alaska, and it's my favorite book of all time. DEFINITELY worth reading. TFiOS was such a disappointment after that book. 




 Yup, that sounds about right. It actually did make me cry at one point just because he's so innocent. Keep reading to the end, it's worth it. 




 Dark hair and eyes. I always seem to like either tall, funny, chubby, nerdy white guys or cute Hispanic boys with nice smiles and cute accents. 




 Milkweed by Jerry Spinelli for school. 8/10. Made me feel some type of way. 




 FINALLY someone agrees with me. I liked the book but I definitely don't think it deserves all the praise it got. 




 I thought so too XD And it's dejaentenduude.tumblr.com 




 Well I suppose, but I'd rather be closer to home. 




 I looove Weezer and Vampire Weekend 3 I'll go listen to the one you recommended, lol 




 From Brand New I'd try The Boy Who Blocked His Own Shot or Magazines. From Bon Iver, try Skinny Love or Creature Fear. Some other bands to try are Counting Crows or The Wallflowers if you haven't already listened to them. What are your recommendations? 




 That's hard. None of them showed up on shuffle, but probably Bon Iver or Brand New. 




 I very much like your music taste :D and thank you! 




 WAIT I FOLLOW YOU ON TUMBLR. You liked on of my selfies on there the other day. What.

 Deja Entendu - Brand New
Pure Heronie - Lorde
For Emma, Forever Ago - Bon Iver

Probably my top 3 favorites ever  




 One of my top 3 favorites. 




 http://dejaentenduude.tumblr.com is mine, but it has no rhyme or reason, it's just whatever I happen to feel like reblogging 




 - I don't care about how big your penis is, please don't mention it anymore because it's creepy

- I wish you could just be open with me and tell me if you don't like me because it's emotionally exhausting trying to read you

- I feel like you're replacing me after we've been best friends for the last 5 years 

For three different people. 




 That made me sad :( 




 The lack of being able to double tap to reply makes me cry 




 There's a guy who lives in my neighborhood with a bunch of reddit bumper stickers. Never actually talked to him. 




 Congrats on the medals to you guys too!(: 




 I think the paper planes are fun until matches start and people start giving speeches. I hope that the plane that landed by Dean wasn't actually aimed at him and was just unpredictably flying and happened to land by him (not that they should've been flown while he was talking anyway). But I think the planes can be fun if they're flown at the right times and aren't out of hand. But yeah, sucks to be whoever has to clean them all up. 




 That is awesome! I love all those teams. 51 is probably my favorite frc team besides my own and these teams all worked together extremely well 




 In the 33.3 percent. Fucking Detroit. 




 I'm sophomore in high school, that's my dream college oh my gosh  




 Reese's cups. Oh my god, do not let those things in my sight. 




 They're not super popular haha. But they're very eclectic, I love thence. 




 I originally wanted a cute short almost pixie-ish haircut but it's too hard to maintain since I have curly hair so now it's like shoulder length with a metric fuck ton of layers and straightened every day, parted to the side. I miss my long hair a lot tho. 




 Vices by Brand New. Ugh. Daisy in general was a bit of a flop imo. I still love it but it can't even compete with Dj Entendu or The Devil and God. 




 I wish I was less sensitive. Every little thing makes me upset. And I wish I was less of an open book and less trusting, because it has fucked me over in the past. Also I need to stop putting the feelings of others before my own feelings. Probably my biggest issue is my social anxiety though. I'd love to see a version of myself that isn't scared of social situations and that could talk to people my age without feeling awkward and walking away. 




 I had to end up learning gradually through internet, friends, vague things at school. I don't recall the exact age but yeah, my mother avoided the subject 




 YES. Wounded Healer is my favorite. 




 5: At college (REALLY hoping for Michigan tech or U of M) working on some kind of engineering degree
10: Steady job, steady income. Hopefully good friends and a good relationship.
20: Married with kids and a family, with an overall happy life, being able to continue an engineering career with good pay while doing something I love. 




 Spent it in St. Louis at the world champion robotics competition. Best time of my life. 




 I've literally NEVER heard of curving a quiz down. That's bullshitty. 




 I had zero interest in boys until fifth grade. Then it was a super tall redheaded boy with freckles and super green eyes. And he was really funny and could crack me up. Holy cow though my feelings were so strong at the time, probably because it was my first crush. But he's a douche now so lol oh well 




 ":c Feel better. Good night." To my ex boyfriend. Sigh. 




 Music and engineering. I like most sciences and stuff but damn I love engineering (especially that of the chemical and mechanical variety) 




 One time in 5th grade I had to go to the hospital because I got pencil lead stuck in my ear. That counts, right? 




 Bed: 12:00-2:00
Wake up: 5 on Tuesday/Thursday and 6:15 every other day

I'm not a smart person. 




 My team is from the Flint/Detroit area as well, so I know what you mean, lol. But I didn't even think about the Jr. FLL teams there. I already get nervous about the FRC and FTC teams, but at least we're all old enough to hold our ground, the FLL teams aren't. Aw. That's really scary. :( 




 I agree. I think the area as a whole is pretty sketchy. I read about a student on one team on here who got mugged outside the hotel. That could happen anywhere, but St. Louis really isn't the safest of all places in my opinion. 




 The build process on my team is very student-led. I think that the thing the mentors help with the most is designing the robot. While the mentors help on some things that they feel are dangerous for students to do, they try very hard to let us do the majority of the build. Usually when you have a question, the mentors will not give you a direct answer. They ask what you think the answer is and they walk you through the steps to get to the correct answer. I would rather have a robot that doesn't win a whole lot that is built all by students than have a robot that wins everything but was made by the mentors. I wouldn't feel like I could take as much credit since my team didn't actually build it, my mentors did. Granted, my team has 45 students and with that amount of people, we can work efficiently build a robot in 6 weeks. With smaller teams more mentor involvement is necessary in my opinion, because there are less people to give out their ideas and less people to work on the robot. I think that if the mentors did most of the work on the robot, it would almost be defeating the purpose of FIRST. 




 Good luck! We love the Thunder Chickens3 




 That's so unbelievably unsafe. Why is this not being reported or signal boosted? People shouldn't be paying 15 bucks for food poisoning and a coke. 




 What about if someone robs your house? By that logic, they should just be able to get away with it because "the law is bullshit" am I right? 




 We're in Galileo too, so good luck! I'll try to snag you a 3098 button if I get around to it (: 




 I'm from 3098 and LOVE your shirts. I don't really have anything to trade, but is there anywhere online where they are sold? 




 I have an ex boyfriend who is currently living across the country who I still try to help and support to no end and yet his friends still all hate me. He was just in the hospital, and his friends all gave up on him feeling better, and got mad at ME for staying positive and saying he would make it. Guess who got out of the hospital earlier this week? Him. While he was there, one of his friends told me "The reason he hasn't given up yet is because you don't want him to" After I tried telling him how much he was still needed and how he couldn't give up. The same thing happened in December. I broke up with him in a pretty bad way back in December and I have apologized sincerely, and I've even been TOLD that they all have forgiven me. Yet they still can't stand me and I've done nothing but try to help him and stay close friends with him. His friends are some of the most fantastic and protective and caring people I have ever talked to, and there have been times after we have broken up where I can joke with his friends and be extremely friendly, but that won't happen again anytime soon. The whole hospital situation really drew the "they really can't stand me" line, even though I supported every single one of them the best I could. We have stayed very close since we broke up, and I still love him. I don't think I could ever get back together with him though because I'm not very emotionally stable sometimes and don't trust myself with him. Additionally, our personality clashes have been really evident as of late. I'm an open book, and he hates talking about his feelings. I sometimes find It hard not to try to pry when I notice things are wrong. It caused a REALLY awful argument last month, and up until then we would still say I love you to one another, but we didn't think we were ready for an actual relationship again. As a couple, we never had those problems. If he ever offered a relationship again, I would tell him I would think about it, but as I think about it and am honest with myself, I realize how likely it is that I would actually get back together with him. Honestly, I still cry on a pretty regular basis when I realize how badly I fucked up by breaking up with him, and I was told a few weeks ago that he still kind of has feelings for another girl, and I felt really awful about that too. I'm not going to even try to talk to him for at least a couple of weeks. Things still need to cool down between me and his friends, and I think it's healthier for me to not try to talk to him. But god damn, do I love and miss him.

 That's awesome! :D 




 I feel you. 




 I already have my heart set on Michigan Tech.

I think I have a pretty good chance if getting in, considering my decent GPA (3.67), and the fact that I'm in my school's robotics program and am going to an engineering camp there this summer.  




 ... Smith. :( 




 This makes me sad. 




 Same thing happened to us at the Southfield district competition. A match got replayed for that reason after a powerhouse team lost a match, but other matches didn't get replayed when the same thing happened. 




 It was a lot of fun. Super excited for worlds.

 As lame as it is I honestly l o v e d the Jason Mraz concert I went to in 2012. 




 [This](http://imgur.com/jTV436X) Was once a normal looking and intact big bird doll, but I took this thing literally EVERYWHERE from the time I was a baby until I was about 6. It means a lot to me because it's the one thing that sums up my time as a little kid because he went everywhere that I went, and all the paint chips and limbs being halfway torn off have little stories. 
























 Mature. 




 In all honesty, I agree for the most part. I still don't use it because I know many people are still offended by it, and they have a right to be. A lot of people don't agree, and I think the n-word still has too much of a negative connotation to be used in a public setting like that, especially at school. 




 I definitely still think it's offensive and not appropriated but I realize that not everyone thinks that way. If you're going to use it, then it should be around friends that you know won't be offended, not a public place. I don't use it ever, but I'm trying to make my point that it's completely different in a public setting like that. I shouldn't even have said that it's  




 I think that it's okay to say around friends and people who you know will not be offended, but it's completely different once you display it in a public area like that. The banner reflected badly on the school and I personally think it should be common sense not to use a racial slur in a senior prank, especially one that is public like that. 




 Seriously? It's using the n-word and that word is offensive in any context. It doesn't matter if it's in a Drake song. It doesn't matter if they "didn't mean" it in a racially offensive way. It's a racial slur and it's not appropriate in any environment. 




 Too much. Always. In every context. 




 I wish my school offered IB.

*sigh* 




 I'm really digging the tie dye one 3 




 In all honesty as much as you guys are joking about it, I do think it was offensive and uncalled for.

EDIT: So I'm getting downvoted for thinking it's offensive to display the n-word in a public place. Uh, okay. 




 Swing Life Away is a GREAT song. 




 [This masterpiece captures every hardship and triumph I've faced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP3sffVKbYM) 




 I'm a sophomore. Hoping to go to Michigan Tech for chemical engineering. 




 I have the SAME problem then wake up with 5 minutes to get out the door. I set 2 different alarms, sleep through them most of the time, AND have my mom wake me up. Still doesn't work. What worked for me was putting in headphones so it blasts the alarm in my ears about 30 minutes before I actually have to be awake. It's horrible and unpleasant but it's the only way. 




 What do you consider a dealbreaker, physically? Is there any kind of personal trait that just makes you find a girl unattractive? 




 Funny and quiet and smart 




 If you're dumb, there's no chance. Even average intelligence is fine but I couldn't be with someone who was just dumb. Also I tend to fall for guys that are kinda cocky and have a big ego and I need to not

 Backseat Serenade - All Time Low 




 I woke up and found pizza on the counter 3 




 My mom. Had a borderline mentally abusive mother, and ended up dropping out of college because she couldn't afford it. Met her fair share of abusive guys before my dad. They had me then got divorced but still stayed best friends, even though he was in and out of jail, but then he passed away almost 3 years ago. So she had to raise me almost completely on her own since I was 2, and even though her life had all of these issues, she doesn't dwell on them and she devotes all her time and energy making sure we're happy and comfortable. She never gave up on me, and despite everything she's been through, she's a damn good mother, and I hope to be half the woman she is some day. 




 Tom Cruise 




 Got denied this big leadership thing at my school at my school I've been wanting since 8th grade :c 




 I'm really horribly introverted 

Buuut I'm also a good listener 




 The names Sean and Jose. Unf.

(Really any Hispanic name tbh but mostly Jose) 




 I started really young, probably about 8, but didn't actually "hit" until 13. 




 I think In My Life by The Beatles is super fun to play 




 That sometimes I just want to be alone and not talk to anyone for a while, and it's not because I'm sad or angry or depressed. I just  want alone time once in a while, and that's okay. 




 Pompeii could work

Dislike: I'm TOO caring and compassionate a lot of the time 




 Ay 




 Well one time my 8th grade English teacher told me I look like a cartoon character so  




 Me 




 I can't even remember. 




 I have an iPhone 5 because I'm an honorary white girl, and I like the phone and all but the battery doesn't even last 5 periods of the school day. I just spent 40 dollars replacing the battery and that didn't help either. Next phone will probably be a galaxy or something tho. 




 Sleeping, or the song Come On Eileen. That song specifically. 




 3.7, might go down to a 3.6 though after this semester. 




 But that's implied. It's the REASON for dress codes. A lot of schools don't enforce dress codes for boys like they do for girls. At mine, guys can have tank tops with the arm holes so big their nipples are showing, but a girl can't have a tank top with thin straps. As stated above, it is understandable if your ass or boobs are hanging out, but it's ridiculous to send girls home for things like thin straps or lots of thigh showing because it *distracts the poor boys* 




 That's not even remotely what the petition is saying. 




 I realized how toxic certain people in my life are, and it's like a weight off my shoulders :) Also, I got a 95 on my last chem test 




 I want to be a chemical engineer. I love chemistry and I love engineering so it combines my favorite things.  




 Week was awful

Weekend so far is good and I get to drive around 




 YES. Once you find something you love to do and decide "this is what what I want to do with my life," that's the best.

 I Don't Care - Fall Out Boy. Whoops 




 Been there. Worst feeling ever, I know. But I promise it goes away with time and eventually you'll see her like someone else's picture and not care at all. 




 I don't know why I find that so funny. I'm in class and saw that have been giggling to myself for about 30 seconds and everyone thinks mom an idiot 




 When I'm just waking up I'll hear my mom in the other room dropping something and just yelling SHIT or screaming my name to yell at me. My mom doesn't normally have an annoying voice, but when I'm just waking up her voice just irritates me more than anything. Like, it makes me irrationally mad. 




 Where did you get that picture of me?! 




 I'm thinking that my "seasonal depression" that I just stopped taking medication for might not be seasonal. 




 Good luck! That's awesome :) I hope you feel better by then! 




 What the hell. How does one write an 8 page essay on teen culture in the 60's? D: 




 About a 3. Got denied some leadership positions and had a sad night and rough morning. Meh. 




 I have... No idea what that is. 




 That essay looks painful. 




 Not only do I have chipmunk cheeks, but my front two teeth are slightly bigger than the other ones so I look like a literal chipmunk. But I still get mistaken for a lot older than I am so idk  




 I guess so :) thank you! I hope you have a good week too! 




 "Better start this essay!"
*opens Microsoft word and browses reddit for 5 hours* 




 When You Can't Sleep At Night - Of Mice and Men 




 No idea why not the marching band position, but for the other one its because I'm "too quiet" I guess. Even though the girl who has sat next to me in chemistry all year and has never said one word the entire time got accepted. So maybe my application just wasn't good, who knows. Oh well .-. 




 Same here. I think for me it's just that the last 8 months have been so draining and I feel so sick of this school year. I normally do really well and turn in all my homework but these next 5 weeks are going to be pretty awful. I know what you mean. 




 Marching band and this program that's basically like "upperclassmen get assigned a few freshman to make sure they don't majorly fuck up throughout the year". But it's okay because I came home and found Oreos in the pantry. 




 /r/marchingband
/r/frc
/r/wtf

Yup. 




 Basically me the past three weeks I feel your pain 




 I got denied two big leadership positions I've wanted since freshman year today after an already bad week. Not my day tbh 




 SERIOUSLY. It's almost physically painful. 




 My eyes are really cool, they're mostly light green with a tiny bit of brown in the middle and a tiny bit of blue on the outside. But my favorite eye color on other people is dark green or brown. I looove big brown eyes. 




 I draw the line when you bring your best friend and they're sitting next to you. Bonus points if the theater is crowded. 




 How close to her are you? Like how much have you hung out with her before? 




 They're 16. You'd think they'd know better. _ 




 Hell yeah I have. I'm close to the boyfriend's family so my friend and I were invited to his little brother's 12th birthday and we were all in the basement playing video games and I look over and they're sitting on the recliner with a blanket over their lower halves obviously going at it. I went home early.

 Going into my third year of Spanish. I love it, I'm planning on minoring in it in college. 




 I disagree with it. I'll sometimes make jokes about freshmen, but they're not serious. Honestly I try to help them out as much as I can, and be friends with them as much as I can, and make them feel accepted. It's hard being a freshman and I try to put myself in their shoes again. The most annoying thing is new sophomores making fun of freshmen. 




 About 1600 people, 9th to 12th grade. It's mostly either people who think they're redneck and southern or people who think they're ghetto, even though we live in the suburbs in Michigan. We just spent $2 million  that we don't have on a new football stadium for a team that won two games in three years. Our tests scores are in the 40th percentile in the state. Pretty below average. 




 Annamarie225/16/f

Golden retrievers and babies are the purest forms of good in the world. Also I like reading and knitting and music and robots. 

Plz. 




 Yes! Oh my gosh I'm dumb, you're psychic. Thank you! 




 This might be a stretch, but there's this classic rock song that I know the rhythm of the chorus to, but I can't remember the lyrics or the name. It's really heavy rock and the chorus sounds really loud. It's one of those songs that everyone knows and has heard, like when I heard it at a dance the other day everyone was singing along. I had thought the lyrics were "You.. give me aaaaall I need" but it doesn't look like those are it. Sorry this is so vague, but it's been bothering me to no end. Thanks if anyone has any ideas. 




 Summer - Calvin Harris
Shamelessly addicted. 




 Rounding to the hundredths place instead of the tenths place. Failed a test that I should have gotten 100 percent on. 




 I have a fear of bridges, and pretty much my advice is to just do it. Don't even think about it beforehand because you'll just psych yourself out. 




 Annamarie225/16/F/USA

I posted here yesterday but I only got like one person so ugh I need to procrastinate please message me ily 




 I'm not sure. I consider myself atheist but I read a lot about Buddhism and Buddhist teachings because I like the philosophy aspect of it. 




 Yeah that sounds like a bad time. Just find a public or not crazy private college that you're interested in. Do some research. 




 annamarie225/F/16/US

I'll talk about anything and I need to procrastinate on my book report halp 




 Annamarie225 16/F I'm willing to talk about whatever and I do marching band and frc and I probably like you a lot. 




 I've had that song on my phone for years and I still think it's incomprehensible gibberish. 




 PARAMORE AND FALL OUT BOY VIP TICKETS TUESDAY NIGHT 




 A dumb boy. 




 Samson - Regina Spektor (it reminds me of someone)
In My Life by The Beatles and Drops of Jupiter by Train both remind me of my dad.

 Mr. Widemouth and (don't yell at me) Candle Cove are my favorites 




 That sounds terrifying either way though! I'm so beyond lucky that's never happened to me, lol 




 Hey my birthday is tomorrow! Happy birthday! Let's celebrate having almost the same birthday together! 




 Sleep paralysis. It can cause some awful hallucinations. My friend gets it where aliens and other weird things pull up chairs next to her bed and stars at her.  




 Thank you. It helped writing it out. Have a nice day! 




 Read but not responded, and he's posted on reddit in that time frame. It's been about 5 days.  




 annamarie225  15/F

I'm from Michigan and I do marching band and frc and I'm tired and my birthday is in 2 days 




 Nope. We were perfectly fine, and we both went to bed because it was late, then the next morning he wouldn't talk to me. 




 Last night. I had a friend who I was talking to and cared about and shared a lot of really personal things with and now he's completely ignoring me and I don't know why. And I trusted him with all these things too. 




 Kik 




 My school has one except instead of being mean you  send in compliments about people and it anonymously posts them it's sweet actually  




 Vans and Converse  




 Boom Clap - Charli XCX. Oh my god it's so catchy. 




 THAT USED TO BE MY SONG IN LIKE 2009 THANK YOU SO MUCH I FORGOT ALL ABOUT IT 




 One thing I notice is that a lot of places and people on the internet really glorify mental illness and depression and self harm. Tumblr especially doesn't shut up about how your scars are beautiful and that mental illness is just this thing for misunderstood moody teenagers. Obviously we shouldn't be criticizing people who have mental illness or have self harmed, but we make it seem like this thing that makes you unique or different or misunderstood when in reality it's awful and doesn't make you feel special. I think that might contribute to it in teenagers especially. It's glorified. 




 I don't. I don't think most girls do.

 That's really cute actually aw 




 Taller than me (not that it's difficult since I'm 5'3"), funny, preferably dark hair and dark eyes but I'm not picky, smart, puts up with being forced to listen to my music, geeky, and maybe kinda chubby. I'm not picky though tbh I take what I can get 




 Hey, one B won't ruin your GPA. That sucks that the stuff on the test wasn't covered in class, that's infuriating. Good luck with all your other finals though. 




 Northern Michigan or nothern California or Seattle. I'd love to move to a South American country but I don't like the heat, so.  




 I think I'm the really shy girl with the weird glasses and 8 different hand sanitizers on her purse .__. 




 Our team is green and black, but we don't refer to it as green, I've only heard my team refer to it as "robot green" for some reason. The whole team is really obsessed with that shade of green for some reason, the lights on our robot were that same bright green and it got us the imagery award at Waterford this year. And we adopted the team name and logo from our school, since we wanted to be integrated within the school. So the captain head is the main logo on our shirts and we incorporated it into our rebound rumble robot, also getting us the imagery award.  




 Here is 3098's wrap-up video from worlds. The very beginning and very end make me kinda sad and nostalgic tbh

 I've been listening to Straight Up by Paula Abdul for a half an hour and you can't stop me. 




 Oh my god. I don't even know. It's a long story and he's really difficult to read but idk. He's frustrating and I have no clue where I am with him. 




 IT PISSED ME OFF SO BAD THAT THE STUPID BOARD GAME SHIT WAS NEVER UPDATED. 




 My friend wrote a really in-depth and long thing in my yearbook. It was super sweet, and at the end it was "If I were a guy, I'd date you" with a bunch of wink faces and idk that made me laugh. The whole thing just made me stupidly happy tbh 




 I once failed a geometry test because I rounded to the hundredths decimal place instead of tenths.

Plz 




 That's super cute, made my night a little happier! Congrats!! 




 I agree. That makes sense, and it's the first legitimately respectful comment I've gotten. Honestly, if I had realized that then I wouldn't have made the original comment. I didn't even think about that before. 




 Whoops, sorry I forgot that thinking that displaying racial slurs in a public place makes me "way too sensitive." My bad.
