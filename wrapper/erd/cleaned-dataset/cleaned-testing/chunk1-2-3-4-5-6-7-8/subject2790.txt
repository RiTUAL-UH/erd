 Was completing a History exam at uni last year. Had finished my first essay question and was taking a little rest before starting the next one.

I looked down and there's a fucking wasp crawling up my top! I had a silent freakout as any noise would have had me kicked out. I swiped the bastard off my top only for it to land on my leg. I then knocked it onto the floor and stomped the shit out of it.

My history tutor happened to walk past at this point and gave me the weirdest look. Really wanted to write an explanation on the exam paper. 




 Jean Grey.  




 "I know what you mean. We'll be all down from early evening so if you decide to pop down I'll see you there, you can give me goss from Blackpool lol"  




 Aged 3/4 I was out at a pub with my family for Sunday lunch. A larger gentleman came in and proceeded to use the fruit machine. His size must have offended me as I immediately turned to my mum and yelled* "MUMMY HE'S FAT!"

My poor mother had to apologise to the man in question and I happily went back to devouring my meal. 




 Vanity Fair - I studied it for my advanced higher dissertation and I struggled to read the book critically as I enjoyed it so much. I still count it as one of my favourites.  




 Philtrum - The space between your nose and lip where it curves. 
























 Some films or TV shows. I remember watching Juno a few years back and crying at the end; I don't even remember why. The worst part was I'd already been laughed at by my mum for crying at the end of Breakfast at Tiffanys (who leaves a cat out in the rain like that?). 




 Community.  




 Using a throwaway account for obvious reasons for the daily reminders now about payment but want to make sure we can all get along to Newcastle in one piece of paper and I have been together just over a year ago. 




 How have I never noticed that?? I really need to hit up IMDB more often.  




 My NSis and NMum do the same. They keep calling FH by his university nickname - he graduated in 2012. He's told them before he'd rather go by his actual name but "That's what he was introduced as so that's what he's getting called."  




 They're the worst, at least bees have a purpose. I actually passed that exam which was amazing considering the panic attack I had following Waspgate. 
























 A bright yellow puffer jacket. I loved my gran but sometimes she picked the most horrendous gifts.  




 [This was taken on Saturday, before a friends engagement party.](http://imgur.com/PBUDuVm)

 I can't pose but I'd just had my hair coloured and was showing it off. 




 Most offensive, it starts out ok but then turns into a cacophony of hours. 




 I know, that's why I wasn't sure whether or not to message them again. I don't want them to feel pressurised, it's the delivery service who would be at fault. It's my first time receiving a gift from out of the country and I wasn't 100% sure what the average delivery times were either.

Thanks for advising me about the username issue, I didn't know if I could change it. It sounds sad but I didn't want to lose my trophy haha. 









 Went to go see The Voices with a few friends. We all work in a pub, some bar, some kitchen. There's a scene where Ryan Reynolds puts Gemma Arterton's head in a fridge. I turned to my kitchen trained friend and said "What's he doing? Raw meat goes on the bottom shelf!" 

She broke down in laughter and I heard snickering from behind us. 
























 I almost drowned when I was 3/4 years old. Until then I loved swimming but it took 3 years for me to even get out of a kiddies pool after it and any attempt to take me for swimming lessons would result in me screaming the place down.

I've never properly learned how to swim, I can do basic strokes but not for long periods of time and can't tread water. I'm still wary in deep water, it freaks me out if I can't see the bottom. 




 The sound and feel of polystyrene rubbing together. It's the worst part of opening packaging. 




 Writing anything in pen. I'm not sure about anyone else but if I have to write for extended periods of time I end up with a massive stain on the side of my hand. 




 I curl up under my covers, plug my earphones into my phone, stick on Spotify and shut out the world. 




 Although I'm with you on supporting the mages (Meredith be crazy!) Orsino is not the nice kindly elf he appears to be. During All That Remains it becomes apparent that he has been at least assisting Quentin with his "research".  




 I second your opinion on Vivienne. On my first playthrough all I could think was "what a condescending, snobby cow." As such I missed a lot of her dialogue because I never took her with me.

After playing again and actually listening to her I realise just how hard she had to work to attain her position, and although her and my Quiz will never agree politically, I can still respect her opinion. 
























 I headcanon that as First Enchanter he's always been able to perform blood magic but never done so publicly because of the (justifiable) stigma around it. By enabling Quentin he had an outlet for these practices until he hit that point at the end of the game where he saw no way out. Not defending him though because it was really messed up, and further justifies everyone's concerns about mages. 




 Are you talking about the POP figures? Because looking at your link those are Fallout 3 figurines. 

Am I missing something? 




 This manager is still in charge of our TripAdvisor page, every reply is littered with errors like this. IMHO it makes us look really unprofessional but the higher ups don't care so she's left to it. 




 Your/You're 

One of the managers at my work was tasked with our advertising for Mother's Day (UK) and displayed signs all around the pub about "treating you're mum to a Mother's Day meal." I cringed so hard the two weeks they were up. I have a problem with this sort of thing. 




 Omg yes! I'm currently at uni and have just started bringing my laptop in to take notes as it is too awkward to write anything by hand. 




 Not had slap on the ass but something similar. I work as a waitress/barmaid and this particular night was on the bar. The pub was quite quiet at this point so I was chatting to some punters. Bear in mind I'm 25 and these guys were easily in their late 40's. 

So one of the guys asks to buy me a drink, I said no as I was working but if I saw him in the pub when I was off I'd remind him. I then promised "hand on heart" that this would happen, while placing my hand over my chest. He took this as an opportunity to lean over the bar and make a grab for my chest "just to check (I) even had a heart." I leapt back and laughed it off, told him he'd just have to take my word for it and went back to work. I told my manager later what had happened and he told me to let him know if anything like that happens again. 
























 Star wars. 




 Get ready for school. I was 5. 




 Chose his girlfriend over me. 




 Sounds exactly like her, if her stuff went walkabout and I was visiting FI then it would be an angry phone call demanding to know why I'd taken the item in question. Even though I knew my own innocence she would never believe it and tell me she "knew" I was lying. Looking back on it now she was probably projecting her own guilty conscience onto me. 




 My NSis used to take my stuff all time, when her and EBIL were first dating she would steal my straighteners and take them to his flat. Her reasoning for this was because I was unemployed and she wasn't, she needed them more for work. One time I was visiting my FI when we were still in a LDR, I'd left my suitcase by the front door and she went through it while I was sleeping and took the straighteners with her to work. I didn't find out until I got to his and phoned her. She decided that since we would "probably stay at his all weekend and play video games [I] didn't need them."

Another time she borrowed a cardigan for a night out with her work, for 4 weeks after this night out I asked for it back and was met with excuses of it being in the wash or lost in her bedroom (which was/is a disaster zone). One morning I got a phone call from her giggling away, evidently she'd lost my cardigan on that night out and decided I didn't need to know but wasn't she amazing for finding it? (It turned out a co worker had put it in his bag and had only just found it.) She couldn't understand why I was angry with her, even after she admitted she had had no intention of telling me the truth if it hadn't been found. 




 Who do I ask about getting one of those? It's never been mentioned at my university. I'll need to email some people in September. 
























 All cats were female and all dogs were male.  




 "Vanity Fair enough to be had on the consequences of convictions for football players and the make up artist did my trial based on my natural skin care products and services try the box below and we will be in the UK but I can try explain an issue here to view the locations of the posts prior to last night and had been okay with it I'll do it for a while to get the best way."

Apparently my phone creates essays. 




 I've had good and bad experiences with zero hours. A club I used to work at would let us pick our shifts a week in advance, the only caveat being that we had to work a Saturday night.

The pub I'm currently working in also operates zero hours and it can be hit or miss. Last week I earned over 200 for working 30hrs, next week I'm only working 17hrs so I'm looking at just under half that. It can be a struggle to budget, especially as I don't get student funding over summer.

Ideally zero hours shouldn't exist, but I can see why these contracts appeal to certain industries. 




 Not had it with pineapple but I can heartily recommend cheese and apple toast. That stuff is amazing. 




 Thanks! :) Sometimes it's really cathartic to actually get the words out of me rather than internalising my feelings. 




 With it being Father's Day yesterday and after reading the [following post](https://m.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3ao0qv/serious_fathers_who_abandoned_your_family_whyd/) on AskReddit and the stories of fathers fighting desperately to see their estranged children it made me think about my own relationship with my father. I realised that even though we've not spoken in over 18 months and will probably never have a normal relationship that there were questions that I still carry to this day.

Why did you drag my brother and sister into your leaving and make such a production of it? (He had them help carry his things into his mistress' car and left them with a letter to give to our mum)

Why did you make no effort to keep in contact with us, besides a passive aggressive status on MSN messenger?

Why, when I eventually reached out at age 18, did you have our entire relationship revolve around money? (He helped me out financially in my first year of university but after that would always bring up how much I would owe him when I graduated)

Why, despite hearing from EMum how sorry you are for hurting us all, is the only apology we've ever had a CD telling us to forgive you or 'get the fuck over it'? 

Thank you RBN for giving me the opportunity to work through my lingering issues and FLEAS and to my wonderful fianc and future in laws for giving me the love and support I so desperately needed.

Sorry that this post didn't really have a point but it was stuff I needed to say. 
























 You've written in all caps so it *must* be true.  




 No problem, I'm getting jealous at all the options you have in the US. In the UK only a humanist celebrant, registrar or priest can marry you as far as I know.

I found [a link](http://humanist-society.org) to the Humanist Society in America, hopefully there's a celebrant in your area which gives you another option. 




 As a fellow bride with a strained relationship with my father - he won't even be coming to the wedding - I can see where your concern is coming from and massive Internet hugs to you.

Would a possible compromise be, as someone else suggested I'm sure, having your DJ play a song dedicated to your FH and FMIL but have the dance floor open to everyone? This would allow them to have their dance to a song of their choosing without the implications of a spotlight dance. 




 UK here, we're hoping to have a humanist celebrant marry us. We have to become a member of the humanist society for 2 years prior to the wedding  (they offer a package for engaged couples). Humanist ceremonies are much more personal than a traditional registrar and as FH and I are both atheists and marrying in an observatory it felt fitting.

 A glorious piece of modern art featuring liquid shit in the toilet bowl, vomit on the floor and period blood smeared on the wall. The tampon belonging to said blood was lying on top of the sanitary bin.
