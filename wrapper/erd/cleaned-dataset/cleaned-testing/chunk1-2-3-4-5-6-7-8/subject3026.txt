 I'm guessing they call them drip tips because the hole is big enough to drip some juice down onto the wick?

well I am perfectly happy to unscrew at time I want to drip a flavor or w/e on top.

What I dont like is juice in the mouth.. and well as tanks empty we tend to tip up. i sometimes put a piece of q-tip in the end.. but that only works for a minute or two before it is saturated and started to make it hard to draw.

anyways all i see are drip tips.. any non drip tips out there? 


















































































































































































































































































 It shouldnt be so instant. Increase the slope by one degree and suddenly you have to walk.. it should gradually slow you down to a walking .. or slower.. speed.

 And seriously most of us would agree if you toned it down a bit. No one is saying OMG .. FINALLY.. I MEAN FUCKING FINALLY... WHOOOPI!!! HALLELUJAH OUR DAY HAS COME OUR DAY HAS COME.

But notice woopie said it, and then daiyuesen posted it, you bitched about it.. bohemianabe properly calls you out.. and then i am posting.. THATS CALLED GETTING A CONVERSATION STARTED.


we need MORE PEOPLE talking about this.. not less. Not sure why you seem to have a logical handicap when it comes to that fact.

Is whoopi the best person on the fucking planet to be talking about it? Do I wish this was the pope, warran or obama.. hey probably, but this is still a good thing.. and sill a good post. Sorry if you hate whoopi dude. SHE HAS A SHOW.. which i suspect you do not. She mentioned our issue, and she is getting more people to talk about it. I dare say, she probably did more with tha one comment than you ass has done the entire time it has been here.

Seriously do you know how a movement works? Hey if you want us to attack woopi.. like you just did and kick her out and ask her to stfu about student loans.. you seem to think that will help? no? a bit over the top? well reread your first comment dude. like I said I might agree, but you went way over the top.




 




 they are the mortal enemy of /r/meatballs a truly free meatball sub, open to everyone.. except the mods of /r/meatball.. fuck them. 




 yeah and there is good evidence it has to do with taking the lead out of our gas.

and for those who dont know the history of how fascists work in america, yall should look up the history of diethyl lead and the scientists who discovered it was bad for all of us.(the scientist who discovered diethyl lead was also the dude who unfortunately gave us CFCs as well.) you will recognize the methods of attack as well as many of the attackers.

how [lead causes americans crime epidemic](http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2013/01/03/how-lead-caused-americas-violent-crime-epidemic/)

[did removing lead cause drop in crime](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-27067615)

whats bad is we have known for 2000 years that ingestion of lead causes people to be more violent.

but when scientists said it was a bad idea to spew it in our air all to keep our cars from knocking...they were attacked as liberals who wanted big gov to control our lives and the dems only wanted to help catalytic converter donors and they were all on the dole just to hurt poor defenceless big oil. They got death threats.. while big oil/gas went to the heartland to get fake scientists to say it was all ok. A gas ceo dranked a glass of what he said was diethyl lead for the reporters.. it wasnt .. HE WOULD BE DEAD. 100%


and when we finally said ok the science is too much to deny.. we got to ban this shit.. we left in 2 exceptions. one for nascar.. cause no one breathes nascar air(which they just recently a couple years ago, stopped using lead) and we allow american companies to sell it abroad to this day.. cause no one shares any air. but the good thing is the PPM in our atomosphere has declined a ton. As of 2013 it is finally nearly completely banned due to other countries laws and not our own.. but there are still a few countries and things that use it.

of course, dont blame the corps and theri fake scientists.. WHICH THEY KNEW WERE FAKE.. AND THEY KNEW THEY WERE LYING.. ESPECIALLY THAT BASTARD WHO DRANK THE SHIT... dont blame them for the deaths and shit that occurred as they fought true science and the removal of lead from our gas.




 




 I'm really surprised at the angles the GOP have chosen on this. Really i would have chanted up and down, that there is a reason why we seal the records of minors.. that we as a society that minors havent developed enough to make proper choices, and so we have set up the judicial system to not ruin kids lives for life, due to mistakes they made as a children and yes this often includes very extreme unsupportable mistakes. 

and really thats something i could actually support. the kid might have been an evil, perverted little shit, but he was still a kid and our society says they are different, even in many cases of murder.


the right could have brought up brain science and how the brain isnt fully formed until arround age 25.. yeah they hate science.

but it seems like all the supporters are taking the religious avenue of defence/attack. 'god forgave him and so should we'.. well hallelujah , lets empty the prisons then.. there is a fuck ton of god in there. And doesnt this open cruz up to asking if he thinks it should be legal?

yeah some on the right have mentioned his age, but.. well the right havent been as good at chanting in unison on that. 




 hes only running to spread messages like this.. and the earning potential.

much like sanders, he doesnt have a chance to do much else.
(hey i love sanders but, reality and vegas says he has no chance)

the reason they run, is to drive the party.. much like sanders wants to start a more progressive discussion, cruz wants to start a bat shit insane, lets have a religious based government discussion.


at any rate the main reason cruz supports duggar, isnt because he is a christian, but because his family is uber powerful in the republican party. though his comments is supported by the bible and all that crap, this is more about politics.. if you noticed huckabee took the time to not only forgive dugger, but also mel gibson for his anti semitic rant long ago... and to attack the liberal media for making such a big deal about it.

its part of the efforts to radicalize the religious right wing, for political purposes. 




 you just using the opposite scale but saying the same thing. 









 and when your car breaks? or you break an arm, get sick. Can you be a single parent at min wage? Sorry sure many people get by for a time like that.. i sure as fuck did in college but please, your doing the exact opposite of what you accuse the article.. you are looking at one single bill and saying "look i can afford that" while ignoring the realities of the cost of actually life.. and thats not just monthly costs thats the unexpected as well.
 




 yeah.. but live? NOPE.

afford things like medical and broken cars.. and prepare for the future and save for college.. NO. You know the kind of crap the right keep saying the poor need to stop complaining and do.. NO they cant.. not at these prices.

barely eek out an existence and still need help, now and then.. sure, no problem. 




 it helps he is a republican.. and a politically powerful one.

if he was a dem, it wouldnt matter how christian he was.. for huck.
 




 This is capitalism, we should offer them an alternative... retool the show into an investigative realocumentary, looking into how many of the upper level and loudest "anti-whatever" people have this kind of dirt in their past.

I'd watch the fuck out of that.
 




 well in this case, you need one above the other. 









 I'm about to.. i'm not interested in max pop. I got my pop up to get all the buildings i wanted and now going to tear down and build the city with rural areas i want. 




 yeah i did this once. A youtube hint says you never have to upgrade your roads if you dont have intersections. I think they mostly fixed it, as have had roads complain but still no intersections is best. 




 but you know it only takes 60 votes to invoke cloture.. and last time he filibustered they got 72
 




 I would respond, but your choice of examples already made my case for me.

translated as "I would respond but cant, so I will just say something snarky.".. seriously this is what passes for debate skills for you right wingers. Yall always do this to. When you lose the debate you stick out your tongue and say NA UH!!!

DUDE the dems fought for women to get birthcontrol covered. MY EXAMPLE IS LEGIT.

your party praises and fights for the hobby lobby ruling and is against gay marriage. DEMS HAVENT JUST TALKED ABOUT IT.. they actually have legalized it all over the country

my example is legit.

The dems havetn just talked about healthcare reform they have reformed it.

SERIOUSLY You AND YOUR ILK.. say republicans who refuse to expand medicaid in their states, whcih will lead to 17000 deaths this year, are exactly the same as all the dems who did infact push for the medicaid expansion and expanded it in their own states?

**DONT BE A TARD ALL YOUR LIFE DUDE... I CAN BURY YOU WITH PROOF THEY ARNE THE SAME**

THE DEMS PASSED NET NEUTRALITY WHILE THE RIGHT ARE FIGHTING IT.. AND THIS TARD SAYS BOTH PARTIES ARE EXACTLY THE SAME. 




  If you had done any research using non Arab sources you'd know better. 

look little douchebag.. quit trying to assume. This is your biggest little flaw. "I AM RIGHT AnD YALL ARE WRONG AND IF YOU DONT ACCEPT MY OPINION, IT IS BECAUSE YOU ARE TOO STUPID TO RESEARCH OR ONLY RESEARCHED BIASED PLACES.. UNLIKE ME CAUSE I AM GREAT"

fuck off dude, you didnt even read my comment.

IT DOESNT FUCKING MATTER.

yeah the ottonman king when he wanted more ttaxes changed some laws on ownership which made the people in the area transfer deeds to one person in town and have him claim to be the land owner. SO FUCKING WHAT.

people live on that land.

I've lived in my apartment for a decade, does that mean I own it? How about if I kill my landlord?

SEE right back at you dude. I guess the israelis own the occupied territory they keep putting settlements on despite it is illegal under international law. NOT FROM ARAB SOURCES. NONE OF MY KNOWLEDGE IS.. actually most is from the encyclopedias and the bbc birth of israel which i am quite sure you will claim is biased case they disagree with you as well.

And yes, you are idiots. Sending generations of young men, women, and children to die to gain a unattainable goal.

LOL.. ok i am just going to stop feeding the troll or talking to the crazy person. Who is sending who were? what teh fuck are you on dude?

Dude you need some serious help. This isnt hyperbole or an attack, but you got some issues that need working out. The least of which is your sheer lack of the ability to debate without being a pompous ass.

 




 downvoting because it doesnt matter.

First the ottomans.. actually not totally true though yeah the king owned a fucking ton of the land, before we overthrew.. I guess that means it is OURS now. to do with what we want.. and the people who actually have lived on the land for generations.. WELL FUCK THEM.

dude, no we are downvoting due to your low effort reply, that since the INDIVIDUALS didnt own the land but their KING DID and we OVERTHREW HIM.. therefore they have no say.  Its horse shit. and give off your high horse when you assume only you know what the fuck you are talking about dude.

the only valid complain you have is "downvoteing without debating"

but when you say 'downvoting without researching" basically you are calling all of us idiots for not acception your point of view and the fact is some of us researched the shit and we still find your comment horseshit. So enjoy another downvote. Cause this comment is horseshit as well.

 




 yeah your sooooooooooooooooooooo right.

I cant stand how dems keep voting to make women buy seperate health insurance for things like birth control.

i Fucking hate how the dems refuse to try to raise the min wage.

I hate How the Dems wont let the gop expand medicaid for the poor.

Seriously dude, you can say they are both corrupt, but once your comment is way our in fucking crazy land dude. I can BURY YOU IN PROOOF if you want. Dont be a dolt.
 




 doesnt seem wise to me.

First off, though it doesnt say in the article, it suggests this comes about due to an anti tank missile hitting a bus, fired from gaza.

removing palestinian passengers not only doesnt alleviate this threat, but seems to me it would increase it. You have to assume they have to get people willing to shoot at these buses, knowing they carry fellow country men.. and well now the buses will only have israelis. seems from a security standpoint, a mixed bus would be much safer. I know some of past actions have freely taken palestinian lives as well is israeli but even with that knowledge it still would seem safer to have mixed buses.

and even if it is suicide bombings that could be alleviated with check points before boarding. IDk someone convince me why this is a good idea.
 




 WEll probably on point with making enemies isnt worth it.
 




 

generally speaking you want it on your fastest drive.  So generally speaking it is best to leave it alone and leave it on the SSD..

now some will complain about writes to SSDs  due to the page file and well, ssds last longer than anyone really thought. Its not an issue.

the only reason to not have it on the SSD is space. 
 




 so it still works.. just no display? you should be able to just plug it in via usb to a pc and browse for the googledrive..

it it is android it is in the android/com.googledrive folder

windows7/8

 c:/users/username/googledrive.

dont know apple offhand.
 




 for me it would be more fair to us tax payers, if insults were allowed, as long as they were grounded in fact. 




 well you would think they would fight this fine, as they would have the right if the law is unconstitutional.
 




 well you dont move it.. but you can set it to use a different drive.

there are arguments for not even using one. however you need to  have 800mb one on the c drive for memory dumps in crashes.. though most people dont use memory dumps for diags.. so you can get by with none.

anyways click windows key and R

type sysdm.cpl ,3 

in the system properties that pops up click performance..

then advanced.


click change under virtual memory.

uncheck automatically...


set it to the drives you want.
 




 The filibusters are great but.

1. they scheduled the renewal vote at this date, so that it is early enough from an election that they wont get in trouble.

2. the last vote had 72 yays, more than enough to bypass any filibuster or even a veto(which there is no threat)

3. since that 72 vote, the senate has become more conservative.(and if you dont get what I mean by that look at the last roll call for the patriot act.. it only passed because nearly every republican but rand voted for it. and he filibustered it last time as well.


so call me pessimistic... but i dont see much coming from this.

 




 . A 1983 Missouri law requires that women buy optional insurance for elective abortion coverage.

wow. I'd like to see if that is constitution, or an undo extra burden on womens rights. No other medical procedure do you require "extra insurance'.. basically the state is saying that a woman must expect prehand that she will have an abortion for what ever reasons. And pay extra for that 'right'


and yeha they damn well know most wont get the extra insurance, because most people who get abortions never ever expected to have to get one.


such fucking evil.
 




 shhhhh there is no war on women.

/s
 




 I dont see anything on the picts.

so it probably is a hardware issue.

doesnt have to be the monitor, could be the card, I am guessing both are installed into same card.



 




 well apparently you attack a christian by wishing them to have a happy holy days.

SOOooooOoOOoo yeah.


anyways at least here, the muslim community has seen an increase in random gun shots into the community.. so far no one has been hurt. 




 it really depends on the person.. i think the newest version has a pop up every 2 hours asking if you are still watching.(dont know I stayed on an older version.. cause it is better)

now work from my pc.. and having teh phones right next to me.. its a bit more than easy to keep them going.

it you cant be near the phones... well its still kinda worth it IMO, you'll prolly at least pay off the phones and you can reuse them for all kinds of things, get an odm meter and use one in the car as a smart meter.. well most new cars do this but for older these are awesome.. can use one as a back up cam.. or a bird feeder cam.. hook to an rc, and have a driving drone.

but yeah i am still buying phones myself..  




 well its mostly been in decline.. a few months ago it was $1 per day per phone(all passive).. and pretty consistent no matter where you lived. so 150 a month per 5 phones. Now you are pretty lucky to get $100, if an american.. (they get paid the most)

last month they had a good 2 whole weeks of shitty service.. many crashes, and lock ups. It really blew, i thought they were going out of business. but the past week has been decent as far as crashes go..except on perk quiz which has been locking up the past 2 days.

 




 it can vary wildly with perk, depending on a lot of things from where you live, to which version and which apps and how you run them.  For the most part you can get 40-80 cents a day per phone on perk.. you can get higher but then it becomes less passive.(or by cheating)

but like with perk swipe and perklive  tv combined with netflix or youtube shows.. you can manually increase your earnings rates up a bit.

yeah i know kinda vague but the answers are all over the chart in /r/perktv these days.. the range is a bit too high to give a proper average.
 
























 have a rather hipster friend, i'd like to help.

she has had failed experiences with various cig like vapes.

I'd like to get her something, low maintenance.. shes not going to build her own coils.

but i want something that gives her clouds and the power to quit.

i'm happy with my vamo/rba setup, and havent been here in ages to check the new tech.. So any advice would be greatly appreciated.

lets say $100 to spend/. 



















 my sales arent updating.. in a timely manor.

i make a new sale and it will show the old stuff.. sometimes several minutes before i can access the new stuff 




 even worse when it wants hammers, screws and chairs at the same time. 

but jesus its always like 20 screws.. sure they are made rather quick, but 20!?! arg, its the one thing I am ALWAYs short on when the boat arrives.

screw da screws.
 




 Anyone else experiencing this? is it temp? Would think if i was banned, i would stop getting points. But past 3 days, when ever i try to redeem, it gets canceled. No answer from MS as yet. 














 it seems to be multiple ads.

what I dont get, is all my phones will freeze around the same time but on different ads.. however the ones that happen to be on the same ad all freeze at the same spot.

I almost never ever get the "are you still watching"

everything locks up before then 





























 Its supposed to be a moderation button but we all know its a disagree button. Why not at least make them say why?  




 i want to be able to look at each ship.. like shipyard view and know when various components failed. Power levels and ammo levels through out the fight. So if i am always losing certain things its easier to see and armor more. or move it.

i want to see the damage caused by each weapon.. what was effective, whats useless. i want to mouse over the jammer and see it jammed 10 missiles that would have caused this much damage if they hit.. while the defensive flairs saved me this much damage.

right now is hard to tell even if the little ships that get blown away fast are worth even having.. or not.. sure they die but do they help?

ship creation is def the coolest part of the game, but could be way better if i had the data i needed to make much better ships. I would play more with the various upgrades, rather than just be mostly concerned with costs and weights.

the game has that computer aiming system, says its better than recruits.. how the hell can i tell.

is turning on rapid fire using up my ammo before it is effective?

i need data!! to become the ship builder of my dreams.
 









 I'm a bit bad at editing my comments, and am slow at it, and often see i already have upvotes after i save. and i figure people should know, so they can take back their upvote if they want.

i dont personally know of anyone completely altering their view to make a bad view it look popular after the fact. But i personally have accidentally left off a contraction.. used an are instead of an aren't which totally changes the comment.  none of those times had many upvotes/downvotes but it could happen. 














 I hear this advice, but when i look at Articles on tips and tricks.. they suggest at level 10.. 90% of the trade hq is expansion parts.

It doesnt work this way anymore. you can often see zero in the list. Most of the time its 2 or 3 out of the dozen or so they have listed.

its completely boring trying to not level up.. and expand under these conditions.(yeah i will try the second account thing latter)..

So basically my question is .. you guys at the higher level, when you go into the gthq, how much expansion material do you see amongst yoru donuts and what not? cause if it is 2-3 like us at level 10.. I'm going back to actually playing. 


































 I was having the most problems with the "if you like perk,.,," pop up but also had problems with perk quiz.

Getting rid of facebook solved both,. 




 If my phone goes to sleep.

or I am stuck on the bagel of doom...

I know what I will find.. if i wake up my phone or fix the bagel.

the STUPID MOTHERFUCKING IF YOU LIKE PERK APP POP UP.

is this the new "are you still watching" timer?

Fuck love how they delay it by microseconds to try to trick you into clicking.

Wouldnt be so bad though, if it didnt crash perk.. ALL THE FUCKING TIME.

I dont think I have ever got the pop up ad without it crashing perk first.
 
































































 I still clear cache regularly, run in safemode or at least airplane.. but i i sit it sitting on a donut, i just click desktop and back to perk. Loads instant every time. 






































































































































 oh look.. you move really really fucking slow.. not in much of any real danger but hey.. we are going to make you feel like you might be.

and cant the fucking dude take his medicine before an important mission? Hey i get the shit is rare, but its like "hey i am going up against the baddest mofo here, think i could have a dose"

game rocks otherwise the the fact i am "infected" has been pretty lame through out the game.  Its not like i needed any influence to do the shit.. i seem to want to save these people and they seem to only break it out a couple times in the game and seems like the only purpose is to annoy.
 

























































































 No i dont care how hard it was.. just how long. 

game gives us an open world and then locks us into that mission for  ages..(ok i suck a bit) but jesus.. from searching every floor of  the school, to the pit levels, to getting out of the pit.. to having seizures despite i stole some antacin early on in the game.. before destroying that batch i found.

hey i get main missions gonna be a bit long... but damn that one. 

maybe give us average mission times, in the quest area.. so we know "hey if you start this one.. its gonna be a while" 



















 Fuck sounded like an alarm concert last night.. with my 9 phones going off.

Love the zinger help on tmobile

click link "how to turn off amber alerts on your tmoble zinger"

get webpage 'that function is not available for that phone"

arggggggg


lol 












































 with the perk codes i seem to be getting a bit more than I am used to.

are their easier ways without buying?

I mainly use mine for the sweeps.. but see you can use in prize mob and perk quiz and dont know what else.

So how are yall spending the perk tokens? 

















































 idk maybe coincidence and they fixed things back at perk.. but none of my phones stick on the spinning donut.. all loading vids fast like they used to. 









 newest version seems to load videos way slow.. my phones are more likely to hang watching the donut.. or just fall asleep loading. Clearing data doesnt seem to change anything now,. And all the non google online stores of apk files seem to have updated.

i'd rather not mess with it, but i'm tired of watching donuts. 














 right now 343445 tickets left..

I dont forsee the drawing this year. 









 Love the game and know you can ignore it, but sometimes its just retarded.

trying to go 500 meters, see some of our guys in a skirmish, stop help, of course get attacked by an eagle as soon as i am done, but before i can loot the bodies, an ammo truck goes by, i let it pass but 2 seconds latter another ammo truck going the same way.. i destroy this one, loot a couple bodies and a chase the courier mission pops up.. i'm getting annoyed, decide to leave and suddenly the base behind me is under attack.(its normally not quite this bad but geez, let me catch my breath, reload.. something) 




 Took me a few too many times to learn this.

leaving banapur or the arena, jumping off a cliff "i believe i can fly"... nope splat. At least it didnt kill me... everytime.


why take it away.. what am i going to do with that? kill bhadra with my awesomeness?

and really why take the guns, they hide everyone they dont want you to kill and you lose karma for killing innocents. the arena is the only place that makes sense.. and actually IN the arena. cause all the audience seems to have a ton of weapons.(ok title is a lie, i dont get the gun thing either) 














 Some wont run without it.

but one of my zingers kept getting really hot and slow. I removed back cover and battery, and now it doesnt get hot at all and performance is keeping up for longer between data cache clears. TEMP DROP WAS 25c@!!!!!!! or about 50F

and I see someone selling the back covers and and batts for $8, and has sold 2 of his lot.

not sure if i will sell mine.. not using the back cover or batt atm, but i might want to repurpose the phone in the future.


(on the zingers, if plugged in and running, if you take out the batt, it will reboot but then be fine)

and PS I AM watching the ADs, these phones are attached to the computers at my work, set up so everyone can see the ads and we have a busy lobby
 



















 how do you perk 24 hours without waking up every to click the 'are you still watching " button

edit:

thanks for the help and info.

going to look into 

auto reboot phone app

and the run on start up apps

if that doesnt solve my issue, I'm going to get a monkey.

Not really a riddle per say, A girl i knew built this in minecraft, asks me if i "get the joke".

has to do with the framed shoes and pants.

the pants and shoes are enchanted, the pants are gold the shoes are leather.

Not that any of this info helps, but its all the info i knew at the time of the question.

I could well be this is some personal joke I am supposed to know and completely unsolvable by yall but at the moment I am baffled... so i decided to cheat and ask yall 
























 Basically asking for scientific guesstimates on what the sky would have looked like.

I figure our light cone radius should be shrunk by even more than 4 billion light years due to inflation. And I figure due to actual relative movement, some have moved out of view and will come back into view as we go back 4 billion years.

 I also get the milkyway was younger, I dont have much info on galactic development.. if baring mergers they quickly reach an average star level or slowly lose stars after an initial burst. And I dont know if we had a merger in that period or how many.

I'm guessing we would see a lot more stars with the naked eye. and with the galaxies closer, i guess they get bigger and brighter too. **Just how cool was the night sky 4 billion years ago.**

4-5 times as many stars? a lot brighter?  




 South Carolina here.

Basically that. Card blew up, was under warranty. Was told it couldn't be repaired and they didn't have an adequate replacement. I agreed to take money instead. They asked me a little bit later if I wanted to wait and see if they got in new batch of refurbs at the end of the month. I said no, I would rather just take the money. Doubled checked with them a few days later to see when money would arrive. They said 3 business days, accounting was cutting the check. I bought a used card of ebay expecting the check. 

In three business days, a videocard arrived at my house instead of the check I was expecting. I figured, they obtained a last minute replacement, and figured it might be their right to honor the original warranty agreement instead of the check as agreed to in emails. I was annoyed, but since I mine the BTC, i put the card to use. But not having the check, coupled with me buying a new card, this has me strapped a bit.(it also didn't add a lot of power as I replaced a card slightly worse than it, as I don't have the power supplies yet to run that many cards.. so not a lot of income gain)

 It's been a week. And suddenly i get a check in the mail from them.


I'd rather have the cash, and more than willing to send back the card... on their dime. If that is an option for me. However, I have already used it for a week.

whats my best options. And Can I go ahead and cash the check in the time being. 




 Basically that. I get a much much better hash rate with the bins from 1.1 for normal scrypt mining. I use the lantis bins and for my twin frozrs 7950 i go from 650 to 711.. steady no hw errors. Across a few cards thats a nice boost.

I'd like to see if I can get a similar boost with these drivers with the other algos.

But amd doesnt have them, all the usual areas and links for linux drivers have turned up empty and there are a quite a few searchers like myself with no luck.

SO does anyone know if that can be done, back up the driver and sdk off one distro and put on this one?  





























 I'm sure it has been asked and I see 1.3 is easily patched, i supposed i could figure out 1.52 but still would be nice to have 




 I get well over 300 with 1.5 bamt

about 250 with this one and nothing i do seems to fix. 


















































































































 didnt think of that.. but no.. [It was released today.](http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/fox/thepeanutsmovie/#share) (and yeah yall can watch here)

maybe they want it at certain places so they can count viewers.. idk.. still seems dumb.
 




 Why don't we see mammals where there are 100 females to 1 male?

there are some gator pops, that might be heading this way due to the way temps select their sex.. too high and they are mostly female and their are worries that due to global warming, the pops will die out because the cooler temps needed to make males will no longer be available.
 




 and placebos?

never had a coincidence happen either.

its not that simple and no i dont think the victims are bigger liars than the perps.

you do know a lot of faith healers, have people PRETEND to be sick and disabled. FRIENDS OF THEIRS IN FRAUD. Others see the supposed healing from a 'man of god' and are fooled. That is FRAUD and yeah it helps if the people watching are ignorant of science but that doesnt make them morons.


 




 and google does the site search.. used them instead of reddits for ages.

just do reddit.com  search query in google for a site search.. no longer need to tell google to do a site search anymore either 














 and..... its gone.

WTF would fox remove an advertisement for fox on copyright grounds.

 




 fraud aside that wasnt the question.

there have been trans that deny they were ever a man to get laid.

quit pretending that doesnt happen.

oh wait you didnt? well the articles title isnt about that.

the articles title on if we should still recognize her as black.. if we recognize a trans.. EVEN TRANS WHO LIE AND SAY THEY WERE ALWAYS A GIRL.

**I agree with you on fraud and she has no right to fight historical opression as an insider, just wish you could have actually debated the question asked and not the one you seemed to want to debate.**

the question is, should she been seen as black, just like trans who lie about ever being a boy.

Lets put it this way, ignore her, what if bruce said he wanted to be seen as a black woman. Thats what i find is an interesting question.. not the bullshit about fraud and deceit that we all agree was fraud and deceit. But that point seems impossible to debate with the current situation because it all twists back into her actions which has nothing to do with the question.

 




 eh..  we are first on other lists.

different people use different methodologies and even the article displays 2 of them.. but yes the US is not #1 in either measure displayed in the article. 




 depends on how you define it.. it isnt easy to measure as you can imagine.

on  [household final consumption expenditure per capita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_household_final_consumption_expenditure_per_capita)  which is the most used figures.

Also mind you those are two different scales.. the one you are quoting is resources and things like emissions, as the article states. the one the title is quoting is land area.

see UAE is #1 when it comes to how much land would each person need if they consumed as much as UAE.

but Kuiwait is #1 when it comes to total consumption, which includes co2 emissions.. as the article states.


the US  is 4.1 on one scale.. the same one with the title.

and  3.9 on the scale you are comparing.

you do beat UAE in one but not the one the title is talking about, but the second measure at the second half of the article.

 




 apparently misc is the only place that will allow this discussion.
 









 yeah it kinda broke the fantasy for me a bit. people are dying left and right... to friends. the entire place is at war. Jamie at least is portrayed at having a little bit of brains.  i dont mind the death, as much as how it was done. its almost like they didnt finish their "homework' and just quickly wrote the scene right before it was filmed. i would have been happier with a tiny blow dart as shes rowing away.. trained monkeys or something else.
 




 I am glad he at least has a helmet in case he needs it.
 




 That one was a bit overly obvious, i thought, for the show. And for no one to be suspicious. Everyone thought it was her that sent the necklace threat. She has the poison troop. She doesnt even want to drink with the lannisters.. And suddenly she has to give her a massive and firm kiss to the lips? and in the world of deceit they live in... idk if a crazy person who seems like they hate me and sent a threat that they might have me killed.. suddenly kisses me.. i'd be a bit wary. 




 and they are about to get sued and lose, after spending millions to defend a losing suit.

yes both sides do it.. and i would like to see a study about how much we spend on these stupid laws that are nothing more than an expensive ass tax payers ad for the asshole who passed them. I am quite sure he was told by intelligent advisors that this law would not survive a scotus challenge but was probably also told that this would be good for him politically, both passing the law and when the law is challenged and he can scream about activists courts.

like my state is pouring money in the gay marriage fight, despite half the US lost that same fight before us.

Jindal knew he was lying through his teeth about the purpose.

Jindal also knows it is totally unconstitutional.

 




 what about multiple accounts from same IP?

do any of yall use phones?
 




 in this the document would be similar to the classified version of U.S. intelligence about Iraq and its purported weapons of mass destruction. Before Congress voted to give George W. Bush authority to invade Iraq in 2002, no more than six senators and a handful of House members bothered to look at a 92-page assessment of the alleged weapons kept in two vaults on Capitol Hill  something we know not because its public information because someone leaked it to the Washington Post in 2004.

well that assessment was also missing dissenting data.

and it would be better to actually point out that this is how it has been since the 70s for every single solitary trade agreement. not sure why nearly the entire media pretends this is new. Not saying dont get outraged. Its outrageous. but the fact it is a secret from the people.. is the same as the last trade agreement. And the only reason why Obama needs a vote for fast track, is because that authority only recently expired.(and yes i know fast track has more to do with congress.).

This is outrageous, but it isnt new or that modern of a phenom, especially when it comes to trade.
 




 how much you earn per day if i can ask. 




 well i also liked how they defended themselves by saying barbara can have a green lawn too

Im a conservative, so this is strange, but I defend Barbra Streisands right to have a green lawn, said Yuhas

"we arent total dicks, i mean we dont mind if rich liberals have green lawns too"
 




 combofix doesnt do 8.1 :(

/r/TronScript  is a decent script for cleaning systems.
 




 The margins arent that razor thin all the time. In my experience, walmart dictates to you what they are going to pay. They are very difficult to deal with and if you dont like it they wont carry your product. You generally HAVE to sell cheaper to walmart than you would to local smaller competition. 




 so a sub mostly about the past.

sigh.


there has been a lacking of content in recent years.
 




 they might have a case then. and i meant to post that to the post above this one.. oh wul.

 The 21-year-old man, who has not been identified, had had his penis amputated three years ago to save his life after suffering gangrene from a botched circumcision. 

damn.. he decided for circumcision at 18? 









 Its generally not accepted at all, and if you see the people pushing the idea, you will find they are the same names that the denialist blogs promote and if you look they dont really have anything but conjecture behind their beliefs.


Like Anastasios Tsonis, says the current 'pause' in land surface temps is similar to one in the 70s, therefore we are entering a 50 year cooling phase.. despite that didnt happen in the 70s.

There is judith curry another famous denier, who simply says long term trends in ocean temps suggest we are heading to an ice age, without really expanding on that.

she also likes to promote the increase in area of sea ice, while totally ignoring the decrease in volume.  

now in the 70s when we had the famous newsweek article, actually most scientists at the time still believed in warming despite the media talking to the minority that didnt. But at  this time, most of the minority that didnt, werent denialist. See not only are we putting chems that cause warming, we are also putting up chems that cause cooling. And we werent as sure as now, at how all the pluses and minuses added up. But we still use the science of some of these people, because they gave us great data and research on the chems we are putting up that cool, like soot and SO2


 




 yeah you can brute force, but

but i remember thee 1st part of the password. 

sounds like pass might be long.. and while you can bruteforce only the part you dont know, probably easier to jog your memory.. it might take time and coming back to it. Try to remember everything about the day you passworded it.. All kinds of things form light connections to our memories, even a smell can bring it back.

had a file like op, took me a couple weeks to remember the pass, but just one day going through shit on my pc, it just popped in my head again. 




 well mind you the fast track vote rn is meaningless.. its a package deal with that thing that didnt pass.. .so people were free to vote for this or against, while planning to do the opposite when it is a real vote. This is sorta saying "if we get our way, this shit will pass, see look we will take a fake vote.. see it passed.. now give us our way" which pelosi wants highway funding.


some of fasttrack isnt wholly evil.. the parts that limit debate and time are, but congress shouldnt be allowed to amend.. it should be up or down vote.  They can vote to recommend.. but if you have 20 countries in diplomatic efforts, you cant have 20 legislative bodies, looking over the agreements and sending them back with minor changes that some minor portion of some 10,000 legislators want. Too many cooks and all that. They should be able to read it.. it should be public, they should be able to take all the time in the world to vote on it.. but up or down vote is the only way this shit can work.
 




 I do wonder if their is a son of sam out there being told to mow my lawn so i dont have to. There has to be the helpful insane.. no? 




 nothing says saint like an ostentatious display of wealth.
 




 i believe their algo takes that into account, when you downvote straight down someones profile.. the votes show up for you but not reddit. 




 fair enough, your correct, and my comment has been corrected. Thank you. 




 Well they [appear to be building nukes for the saudis...with the help of china](http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/world_news/Middle_East/article1557090.ece) and this isnt that new, its been going on for a [few years.](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-24823846)

and this on top of [starting the NK program and helping libya start theirs and iran in their renewed push](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/07/pakistani-generals-helped-sell-nuclear-secrets)

They pretty much are the nuclear black market.

I agree its mainly about keeping the government there, but its more about location than nukes. We might need to reassess the cost benefits of it all.
 




 if you look at things that were eventually released without the redacting, there doesnt seem to always be a lot of sense with redacting. Sometimes they just seem to do it to do it.

Here [is the martin luther king letter where the FBI urged him to kill himself](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/11/fbis-suicide-letter-dr-martin-luther-king-jr-and-dangers-unchecked-surveillance)

they cut out the worst of them calling him names, and cut out saying he doesnt actually believe in god, but then they say he is evil and urge him to kill himself without redacting.
 




 it would be hard to incorporate the language in the copyright code but something's have become so commonly linked into our history, that it really should automatically be open. It should be limited to things like this and happy birthday song.. but certain things just belong to all of us now.

Though i'm fairly sure you should be able to watch the speech in an educational context as the code stands now. 




 It might not be as significant as he states, but its a bit much to attack him with a "bullshit". A large part of the reasons people settled here was due to religion. Understanding things like why under god was put in our pledge. A def need a good understanding of religions in general to understand some of the strife around the world. I dont think it is as significant as some think, but he also just said 'basic understanding'  and well our history is replete with people using and abusing the bible, a basic knowledge of the book is most helpful in complete understanding of our history.(I'm an atheist but there is still a difference between use and abuse) 




 yeha i was going to expand into western versions, like the johnsons, and how people were also named after jobs like the smiths. i'd like to know how the actual transition period went, where we just stopped saying son of john, and just named them all johnson from then on, no matter the fathers actual name.


 




 thanks for the helpful correction. Many are not so helpful. I use the term a lot, and have been misspelling it for decades. LOL
 




 yeah i'm not even sure what he is countering.

'i dont think that will work and would be surprised if it did'

when i show him an example of it working. it could be culturally it wouldnt work here. but the facts are they take scummy people that are just as scummy as our scummy people and make them functioning members of society.  If we cant point to the cause, that is exceptional from america,then its idiotic to not try. 




 What works for Norway will likely not work here.

why? cause you said it wouldnt? Your comment might have validity if you said "just cause it works for norway doesnt mean it will work here"

but we cant know that unless we test these thigns right? SCIENCE, over EMOTION.

norway is a data point, they have better records than us, we need to get rid of the variables that DOES NOT CAUSE THIS. one fo the variables is their type of prison system.

I'd be surprised if it did.

And you probably shouldnt be involved in the science to see if it does. like it or not our system isnt working well. Their system is working better. Yes it could be culture, it could be a number of things, but only a moron wouldnt want to try it.


edit: [it does work in america.. we just dont do it wide spread, but the prisons that do have better rates than the prisons that dont.](http://static.nicic.gov/Library/023358.pdf)
 




 and you have validated my assumptions. Someone that corrects someone with a snarky dickhead comment, rather than anything of any use is probably a snarky dickhead who can be ignored. And looking at your comment history, i can see you offer pretty much nothing but dickheaddom to reddit. Congrats. You also forgot a comma.

and seriously look at his comment history, full of grammatical errors and you come here to be a dick to me.

Yeah, ok. Why don't you try reading a book about naval warfare and still think a "fleet" of Chinese pirate ships could even tackle a single Warship. I doubt it.

look at this mangel of a  sentence.

I guess you weren't

willing to take the mere seconds required to express their idea intelligently it is reasonable to ignore you

if you are going to be a massive dick about grammar, it helps to not have a comment history like yours, with crap like that. And all you do is attack people. You never offer any helpful corrections. You just scream everyone is ignorant but you while offering zero substance to back that up.



 




 tell me this. You got a mean dog and you want to make him a nice dog, which is better, treating the dog well or beating it? If you can understand that why cant you understand that treating people like scum, might produce scummier people when they get out?

in norway they have a program that has a much lower rate of recidivism than we do, and the place would make you puke. they are nice appartments and all the guards call the prisoners sir. They are treated like respectful members of society and the crazy thing, is it becomes habit and when they get out, they generally are respectful members of society.

they [have the lowest recidivism rate on the planet](http://www.businessinsider.com/why-norways-prison-system-is-so-successful-2014-12)

we on the other hand, make it hard for them to ever come back to society, many cant get housing or a job, cant vote or go to college. And then we pretend they are faulty humans when they turn back to crime.

maybe we should dispense with emotions, and look at the science and actually try to do something effective, rather than something that makes us feel good,. 




 sorry in casual convo, people tend to get casual, if you want me to type this comment up in report form, it will be much cleaner, and grammatically correct. If you have trouble understanding any sentence, please inquire, and I will make it more clear for you.

Have a great day

!!!;,...:?"'  extra punct, so you can put them where you want them


edit:

people who post comments like this shouldnt be such dicks about grammar.

Yeah, ok. Why don't you try reading a book about naval warfare and still think a "fleet" of Chinese pirate ships could even tackle a single Warship. I doubt it.


**douchebag who makes grammar mistakes through out his comment history is only attacking my grammar because he cant debate my point.** 




 Its a biblical survey done by a christian group that has the goal of putting more religion in society. The poll seems done ok, but the conclusions are going to be a bit wack.

They are trying to show we are a bunch of heathens who forgot our bible and we need it back in the schools.  




 they didnt have last names persay.. from biblical info would be Noah ben Lamech. Or Noah son of lamech.

its where the bin names come from, like bin laden. Osama bin laden really is translated osama son of laden.


its how last names developed in the region. When you were in small tribes there wasnt really a need.. so you were just such and suchs son or son of such and such. It wasnt til we got larger societies that their was an actual need for last names. And jesus would be jesus ben joseph, which he seems to be referred to in jewish texts 




 Its a poll from a religious org about the bible and christianity's influence on society, they are going to be a bit non scientific. Real scientists in this area, complain a lot about the sudo religious science, because they are so heavily biased when they do things that they cant look at things objectively.

however this thing reads very political.

like that second quote of yours, its a true false question.. the fact that its below 48% should be concerning to them, because random guessing should product that, it sorta suggests that no one knew. Otherwise the small amount that actually knew would push that bias over 50%

and til yall are the mosiac generation.
 




 yeah, you'd thing that, but after literally millions of surveys, we have a very good idea about the numbers and types of people who wont answer or do fake answers. Turns out the snarkers are a relatively stable percent of humanity. 




 If france is successful..which it wont be but if it is, someone will just make an 'forgotten links' search engine.


much like the undelete subreddit here.  




 er

jet fuel cant dank bush.
 




 It isnt, People cant read. Which is quite odd for /r/science.


and there's a low score on the so-called healthy food availability index.

..among other things

but [if you look, the reason they added the extra qualifiers](http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2012/01/24/aje.kwr445.full) is because NO just being 1/4mile or more from a supermarket isnt very meaningful.

 Counting supermarkets is logistically more feasible but relies on the potentially incorrect assumption that only supermarkets offer healthy foods and that the availability and quality of foods offered by supermarkets are invariant across neighborhoods (1214). I


and right now the science is young on how to accurately measure all this.

 




 this is /r/science correct? There seems to be an entire slew of people who cant read.

 researchers defined food deserts as areas where distance to a supermarket exceeds a quarter-mile; the median household income is at or below 185 percent of the federal poverty level; more than 30 percent of households lack a vehicle; **and there's a low score on the so-called healthy food availability index.**

SO NO, just being 1/4 mile from a supermarket doesnt count. The quality of your supermarket matters as well. The fact of 30% lacking vehicles is no big deal to us who bike ride and walk to the grocer but there is a slew of people, who have a high tendency to be impoverished that have a hard time with this, like the elderly.

i dont mean to be overly snarky, but i tend to try to be more exacting when commenting here... reread the article and such, to make sure what i say is supported. It keeps the value of this subreddit high.  




 they'd get more selling them on ebay 




 [he was tucking](https://vid.me/yOtY) 




 Sigh, wish i heard about this a while back.. i just bought two. one for me, and one for a friend.

Mine did the autofire thing before i even charged it the first time.

I sprayed down with electronics cleaner and got it to work again, after a more than thorough cleaning. hope helps some, i guess some juice might have gotten into it. but i really didnt have any real leaks, just the normal light film crap you sometimes get under the atomizer. hope this helps someone.. anyways you can get it at walmart in the auto section for about 5 dollars. 




 yes I would suspect that people who have a tendency to read articles on healthy diets would also show a similar drop. And i wouldnt expect the reading has much of a medical effect. 




 whats the story on the istick?
 




 you right to swing your arms ends at the tip of my nose.

and funny, i hear this all the time from you right wingers...... until you force single unwed mothers to post a list of their sexual partners in the paper in order to put her kid up for adoption.. cause jeb bush feels single mothers need public shamming.

yeah your all for privacy until it comes to poor people.. and automatic drug tests to get aid.. but god knows cant fucking drug test the bankers who are also getting welfare.

same people flipped the fuck out over Obamas under $250 anonymous donations, cry free speech over citizens united which allows unlimited anonymous donations, not just tiny 250 dollar chunks.

needless to say your pretty transparent.

and as for public shamming, there is a little lawsuit about what yall did to mann.

Also science is right or wrong, it doesnt give a flying fuck about your uneducated opinion.
 




 its highly unlikely that humanity will die out from agw. And really doesnt help to suggest that. Society will be greatly disrupted and dealing with climate change will be EXPONENTIALLY more expensive than mitigating it. but life will mostly go on.. there will be more conflicts and wars and year mostly poor people dying off. but with the wars and unrest a lot of the wealthy will die from agw causes.


but the world and mankind will go on.
 




 The GOP obviously.

A. only a moron would think the dems intended for federal exchanges to not get subsidies.

B. the supreme court wouldnt hear the case, had the GOP not brought it up. Its not proactive.

c. it would take one line to fix it and the gop wont.. they will insist on repealing the individual mandate. Which is basically repealing Obamacare.

Only a complete dumbass wouldnt blame the GOP on this clusterfuck. Had the GOP not acted, everyone would still get their subsidies. No matter what as the supreme court isnt proactive.

cause - effect

pretty fucking simple.. but i suspect you right wingers will cry

"show us one republican that voted for this mess"

lol  doesnt matter

yall sued to kill subsidies

yall are at fault


yall can blame the dems for aspects of the law people dont like.

the young dont like being forced on insurance. Small businesses hate the 1099 crap.

but if you think you will be able to blame the dems on yall killing the subsidies.. well I got a government closure and ted cruz for you to talk to. The dems didnt get blamed for that horse shit either.
 




 mildly cool you mean, separating all the things that can crash your entire browsing experience into separate processes so only the failing thing crashes rather than the entire browser and all tabs like in the olden days

[here read more on it.](http://www.howtogeek.com/124218/why-does-chrome-have-so-many-open-processes/)

it makes you safer somewhat from exploits as well.

 




 pure vg will be easier than a mix with pg. and if you look at some of the youtube reviews of the istick you will see others agree. Some people just are more sensitive to pg, especially at higher temps. You will see the same complaint as yours all across youtube. I felt the same.. i make my own juice, went to full vg, now i can 25wat no prob.. and often higher,. And i normally prefer a little pg for throat hit, until i started to higher watt and subohm.
 




 cheaper per month, which can be easier on the poor to own. 

However, that "cheaper' comes from the html title. ROI when new cars are cheaper than used ones. Which suggests he considered total cost of ownership.  But he doesnt go into it enough to say that directly. And the whole thing is based on a 1 year old used car. Which used to be the sweet spot for ROI. due to the massive drive off loss, which he suggests isnt quite there anymore due to cash for clunkers taking off so many used.

and he also makes the same comment as yours later,

If there's a general rule you can take away, it's a reminder of an old one: The real price of a purchase isn't just what's on the sticker. It's the full amount it's going to cost in actual cash flows over its lifetime.

 




 well this you see a lot at all levels of income. People dont plan for major downturns. I know often they can't. But even when they can, people just tend not to. your resteraunt is doing well, you kinda expect it to always do well.. lose a key chef, or a new interesting place moves in next store and and things slow down, you think it will pass, people are just interested in new but it stays slow and you find yourself in trouble. unfortunately then a lot of people turn to credit and get in real difficulty, it can be fairly cheap until you cant pay. 




 [when buying new is cheaper than buying used](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703921504576094264156257224) (wsj)

Edmunds.com, the auto-shopping website, now maintains an intriguing list of cars, SUVs and trucks where you could end up paying less per month for a brand-new model than if you bought a typical one-year-old used oneassuming you are buying the vehicle with a loan.

not only reliable but sometimes cheaper as well.

 




 it also costs a bit more to be poor. 

from transportation, to groceries, to laundry and financial services and credit.. and extremely expensive on time due to the same things above.  Having to ride the bus to do your laundry with its multiple stops, indirect routes and probably your stop leaves you walking still.. and then, having to sit there with your clothes.

I am not questioning your anecdote, i have known the same sorts myself, without a doubt it is one aspect of poverty. Just adding that poverty isnt the same as non poverty living.  and what some people might see as bad with money, isnt always. like shopping at the over priced convenience store because you cant make it to the grocery store.

 




 I agree with a lot of points.

Hear are some of my own. To many people seem to think freedom of speech means i have to listen to it or that it comes without condemnation. you are free to hate, and we are free to condemn you for it. Not that he meant it like that but when he said the thing about silencing people is denying your own right to hear.... well pretty sure the silencers, dont want to hear it anyways.. thats kinda the point.

his example on the guy denying the holocaust, i have no problem with people who deny all kinds of things. I dont think it should be banned. i'd rather know who they are. but in the same breath and to change to a less loaded subject, I dont think the time cube, or expanding earth theory should be taught in school.


its not silencing them to say they havent earned that soap box.
 




 I can agree and actually see some of myself in the article.

but one thing rubs at me a bit.. and though he had an awakening...

mainly because it seemed to me that liberals were exaggerating the case for global warming as a kind of secular Millenarianisman environmental apocalypse requiring drastic government action to save us from doomsday through countless regulations that would handcuff the economy and restrain capitalism, which I hold to be the greatest enemy of poverty. 

they never seem to explain why.. liberals want to do this. others might disagree with the regulations and things liberals want to do and have done.. and as a liberal i can say the same about conservatives, but neither has a goal of destroying the economy.

I always hear vague things about "control" and yes the government is infamous for passing and doing things that control us, but a carbon tax... equates to total control over society and the destruction of capitalism cause we feel like it?

(and on a side note, its kinda unfair that liberals get labeled the ones who want to regulate society, when conservatives want to regulate what you can put in your own body, who you can marry.. what poor people can eat.. talk about gun control? there is a town near me where YOU HAVE TO OWN A GUN.. its the law.. thats conservative government control.)

ugh.. ok dont want to get too political but it happens. he is right, there is also confirmation bias, and we all do it some. I try to stop myself but it happens. being a skeptic does help as we are more used to our 'feelings' being wrong.. time/space/sitting to close to the tv, the earth is spinning and yet we dont fly off... etc 




 it is cepr and this is based on good research but i do have a couple problems, or things that need more clarification. First it shows productivity in restaurants and grocery stores has been flat or down. Not exactly the bastions of automation.. and many people havent taken to self checkout yet.

also with the extreme amount of people needed assistance these days, you would expect that eating out, and buying hundreds of dollars in groceries is down. self checkouts or not. 

and our obesity growth actually stopped the past few years and went down for young kids, which would lead to a productivity stagnation in their examples.

also i wonder if they count the shift to online purchases, there are many grocery items people get from amazon now, in automated subscription services, this would lead to a decline in groccery productivity. If they dont count the non grocery stores online. Like I dont buy razor blades ever at the grocer anymore. Or batteries or a slew of items you get totally ripped off on if you buy there.

also the big problem with robots, is on the horizon, its easy to shift manual labor jobs or even force them to get skills to take skilled jobs, the problem is when robots start taking skilled jobs.

last the robots are taking some jobs. It might not be 'effecting' income disparity according to cepr. but capitalism has this supply and demand thing.. if there are far more jobs than applicants, the wages go up. Its econ 101, so if amazon wasnt putting so many robots in their warehouses, there would be more jobs needing fulfilling. now there can be other reasons why the data, comes out flat like it does.. or not showing a steady trend. Like as wages dont keep up with inflation, the rising productivity of robots isnt shown because of the declining buying power of the people. Or perhaps we are birthing people fast enough to make up with the declining jobs.

despite how it sounds, I dont totally discount what they say, i just would like an AMA with the dude who wrote it, because i have serious questions about his conclusions.


 




 goat in the water
 




 There is a physics prof vaper on youtube, that makes her own mods and crap. Shes pretty cool, she charges outside. i believe in an explosive safe container. 




 the quote is interesting considering it predates the changes to the pledge.
 




 with how much the right praised putin in attacks against obama, i thought he was going to be their presidential nominee.

Be wary of those who refuse any and all attempts at diplomacy. That believe all disputes must be fought with blood. that only increasingly hostile rhetoric will bring peace.. just like it does in bar fights.
 




 or do the opposite and post to /r/PrettyGirlsUglyFaces  




 How about we blame both congress and the executive(obama AND bush), since they are the ones who are supposed to have oversight over the admin and they passed many of the laws that the admins have been using for this power. And if they dont have the proper means to do PROPER oversight of the executive then that is a matter of discussion and a good time for it being election season.


I'm not sure why congress should be absolved when they keep passing these horseshit vague ass laws.. like the freedom act which isnt much different than the shit we had before. 




 look in autoruns.

also process explorer can help, you can pause the processes relaunching it. its not in tron but i have often used in infections to pause processes that protect each other by restarting when one or the other is killed. but its part of the sysnternals ms suite that autoruns came in.
 




 thanks, i didnt know the details that well, that is quite interesting. 




 Dunno about the UK. But in America, health codes and insurance. Someone might get sick and sue.

you dunno about america either.

If you go to a food bank, 90% of the food is unsold food from local groceries.

A LARGE PORTION IS PAST THE SELL BY DATE.

But we have been doing this for decades.

you get a fuck ton of stale bread and donuts, a fuck ton of lettuce and onions. and a fuck ton of cans of cream corn but that comes from people throwing that in the big cardboard box. whichs seems to be the only reason why they buy it. You get normal expired package food as well but a fuck ton of bread.


I dont think there are many legal issues for the stores.. and some tax write offs. but see they arent serving food, they are giving you prepackaged food. The food banks will warn people because so much of the food is after sale date(but there is leeway in the dates) to not eat it if it seems bad.

but yeah without the stores giving away the unsold food, many families ON FOOD STAMPS would go hungry. Food banks fill in the blanks for food stamps as well as help out families that just have a really bad month and we wouldnt survive without grocery stories. (used and volunteered at one for a long time)
 




 All but one of the these facilities is owned by for-profit entities, and by far the largest number of hospitals  20  are in Florida

of course the CEO had no clue, his corp was bilking the government for billions.

 I thought this was common knowledge.

happened to me 20 years ago, the price between insured care and uninsured was exponential.  I was told that the insurance companies make deals where i couldnt.
 




 well whats funny is the deniers demanded they be adjusted. you know heat islands and other problems.

then we do and they scream "LOOK YOU CHANGED THE DATA'

and remember the richard muller BEST study was to prove the data was bad. Instead it proved the opposite to muller.

It doesnt matter if you take adjusted data or not, the changes arent great enough to change the plot lines from showing mans influence.

it doesnt matter if you just take rural areas that havent changed in decades.. they all come out with graphs that are in great agreement with each other.

there is a reason why denialists have to argue from blogs and youtube videos.

 18650 lithium-ion batteries

totally blows away AA rechargables. I have never been happy with headsets and flash lights using normal AA rechargeable batts.. they just never last or produce a lot of power.  18650s are awesome. Last long time, plenty of power.. survives lots of recharges. 




 I do the happy dance when i dont get invited to those things.... maybe i shouldnt do it in front of them though. 




 It was made very clear that anything that could be considered as marketing to children will have severe repercussions to the industry as a whole. 

I'd like to see the science behind the idea of "marketing to children".  It seems to me that at the most common ages to pick up habits like smoking(which for many it was to look older), could actually increase its appeal.

from my experience, at puberty ages, there can be a blowback against "childish things".. and "i'm too old for that"...and the same people will return to the nostalgia of those childish things when they get a bit older but between 16-23 or so, they avoid em. they have this need to be seen as an adult. and it feels good to bypass your age range, like to be able to see an r rated movie under 18. Everyone is how old to i look, wanting to look older.. they like to talk about their age as "nearly...the next age up" where the older you get the opposite sets in.

So I really wonder, since most start smoking in puberty i wonder how much cartoon advertising actually effected them.. positively to buy things. I'd rather be a marlboro man than a stupid cartoon camel.(i dont mind regulations so much, as long as they are based on science and not emotions, a lot of things we feel are true..like time/space... time feels shared and it just isnt.) There is a possibility that teens could see cigs/vaping as a definition of being an adult. Especially when you  force advertising to abandon anything that could be perceived as childish.. the exact same thing kids in puberty are doing as well.
 




 sorry but it does. AGW is as much chemistry as it is physics.

From how we tell how much co2 comes from man.

to the long chain molecule break down of oils

to the various other chems we put in the sky and how they work.


to calculating past sun spots.. we look at CHEMICAL changes here on earth.

and sorry but someone with the crappiest science degree on the planet, is going to no more about science and how science works and the scientific method, and stats, and how stats work, and how experimenting works, and how peer review works, over someone who graduated in theology. or most other non science degrees.

yeah it doesnt matter as he probably hasnt done any work in the field of AGW and his degree is limited, but I think he can actually read technical papers and understand them and in that case, it isnt irrelavent at all.

 




 sorry but someone with a science degree.. any science degree is going to understand the scientific method, and that the entire science of global warming didnt come from al gore.

Chemistry.. tell me my friend, the ozone layer,  does it effect AGW? what is destroying the ozone layer? what kind of process do we call that?

Also CO2 is one of the culprits of climate change. Why? Who might know things like the spectrum absorption properties of carbon? Who might operate a gas chromatograph.

no I doubt that hsi chemistry degree from 60 years ago, has anything to do with global warming...

but you do know the SCIENCE of global warming started with swedish chemist [Svante Arrhenius](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svante_Arrhenius)

so sorry dude.

1. he is a scientists.

2. chemistry is vital in climate science.

3. all scientists are going to understand how science works and that it isnt a dart game that we all just vote on at the end of the year.



 




 I was once in an arcade, friend of mine about 8 feet away tossed me a quarter, i missed, and it flew right into the slot of the game i was trying to play. Sorry no picts 




 yeah but the good news, the multi billionaire koch brothers who put a full page ad calling for the food stamp cuts while simultaneously lobbying for more benefits under the farming bill, can take home a little more this year. I was really starting to worry about them after not getting their keystone pipeline.  /s
 




 Thats what encouraged this posting. Seems like he comes out all the time now.. and its worse because he's wrong. I bet like me you thought the game had updated and added a new factory, only to find out he is a lying bastard.
 




 perktv live/ perk swipe the best.. non passive.

pop quiz the best passive.
 




 a warning for what?

can we see a copy?

sorry to demand proof but there is a lot of BS constantly in the beermoney networks. people used to say you would get banned from bing if you cashed out from the same ip as you searched. In the nfo here, it said to not just watch app trailers or you might get banned. both total horseshit. So can i see the warning about perk pop quiz when you were totally within the terms of the TOS? (unless they changed it.. yes you can have 5 phones and run passively.. it would take 3 lines of code to prevent it) 




 can we see a copy of the email for ban reasons?

i find it more than hard to believe they would ban people for using their app within the terms of the TOS. Passively, so fucking what.. if they didnt want to allow people to do just that, all they need is a next button between questions.  crap even perktv they have "are you still watching".. nah if they wanted to stop passive behavior they could, there is zero reason to just ban people to do it. Crap have an 'are you still playing" every few hours.

So I am highly skeptical at these claims.


 




 cant they set a flag after you have upgraded factories that yes you know that you can upgrade them. and whats bad is all my factories are nano.. but my population is right at 150k.. so when it goes up or down, that dude comes out and says i can upgrade when i cant.

and yes I know I am low on simoleons and yes i know i can upgrade residences to earn more. 




 the left wing side of religion tends to be more accepting. They often(though not necessarily in this popes case) think you are still going to hell, its just not their business in stopping you. the right is the opposite, which is why athiests tend to be worst than muslims to them. 




 waiting til asked is fine.. the point to the ID is the 1099 law, that once they pay you over 600, they have to send you a 1099 and one to the irs. for taxes.

 




 yeah i have a trickle charger for the car i was going to see what it could do in full sun with cell charging. 




 every year 




 or like hedge fund managers who make an insane amount of money, simply hedging and taking percentages of others. They arent adding very much value to society even for those they work for, compared to compensation and they tend to pay the same tax rate as someone making 80k a year.. and sometimes less.

paulson who bet against the housing market right at teh crash, made 5 billion dollars, the most of anyone for 2008, he paid 15 percent on that.. where most ceos pay higher percent making less than 1/10 he did.
 




 your point about him not spending money, somehow making the dollar more valuable simply isnt true. We dont just minus him off the m2 data.
 




 at least a warning. Most large parking lots, especially healthcare areas.. like his ticket was from, where its kinda critical for people to get in in a hurry and less critical for them to get out in a hurry, they tend to have 'head in parking only'.  I wouldnt be surprised if that is common for all healthcare areas and not just here. 




 btw christians are chopping peoples parts off in africa, its just not as wildly reported. But Uganda, CAR, congo and other nations where people are often chopped up for being muslim or gay. 




 the opencandy sucks.

anime? eh, i'm going to have to disagree. I dont care how it dresses, just how it does the job. And sorry but in the past 35 years of computing, i have seen all kinds of retarded names and retarded designs..IDC as long as it gets the job done.

 




 NOPE AND NOPE and dont listen to the guy about flagging..

 using their software as intended will not get your banned.

I dont care how mania you are about it.

there is no scrutiny if you are following the rules.. dont care how big the redeams, or how fast, as long as it is possible under the rules.

Make sure they have your ID for tax reasons otherwise one day a reward will hang and wait for you to do just that.

ALLL THAT BEING SAID... its a good rule of thumb for all beermoney to cash out as quickly as possible.  Due to bannings, and project failures.. or hacks. But with that being said, i always cash out at 50 on perk wallet.
 




 You phones cost about  25 cents a year each.

 well it wasnt so much the method of communication as for the idiot with the camera. if the method of communication was compromised, we wouldnt declare it. to make them move and hope they get into a trap. Think enigma.. why didnt we just tell the germans 'hey we cracked your code" and hope they move to a different form of communication.

i do think the other asset on the ground is plausable though unlikely, it would be a major gift, if they happened to post a picture at the same time.

i think it more likely the fact that this is a rare occurrence made the info not very valuable. And making the enemy look incompetent, is more valuable. Someone wanting to join the big battle against america, might think twice that isis is their answer. 




 sarcasm.. yeah poe says you need a /s and he didnt include a /s
 




 making the enemy look like idiots can be more valuable.. and there probably hasnt been a rash of these, nor a rash to look forward to, so protecting this info isnt such a big deal. It would be different if every time they set up base they all took selfies. we wouldnt hear about that. 




 ALL religions have formed arround fictional chars.

unless you got a god in your pocket you can share with the crowd.

the point was the teacher... the prophet.. was real. or claimed to have been.. not someone in some far off heaven.

I still agree with you, that you dont need any reality to get people to follow.. NONE ZIP.. but the claim, isnt about the gods its about the teacher.(though it gets conflated with christanity as the teacher is a god)

 




 i beggining to think we are arguing different points..(and I am in your camp but i think i figured what they are saying)

 formed around and from him

I'm guessing they are saying jesus didnt have to be real.. because paul invented the religion.

not that it wasnt based on jesus and his teachings.

however I dont think that matters, since OP, was claiming "jesus is claimed to be real because people wont follow non existent teachers"(though muhammad tried just that.. it just didnt work out too well for him).. to me it doesnt matter if paul invented him or not.. paul is saying HE WAS A REAL PERSON.


with respect to OPs comment, not sure how people could form a religion that comes from jesus if he was imaginary. I mean jesus couldnt imagine himself into reality. meaning if it started with jesus... over paul well then of course jesus would be a real person. he started the religion. Since it DID start with paul, jesus still can be real or imagined.. but paul claimed he was real. So not sure what they are going on about, even if its not on the same ideas that we are going on about.


 




 but the christ in christianity...., lets put it this way, whose teachings did paul promote?
 




 No politician does anything 'for the good of the people.'

most, i would agree with you, but when you say NO.. then you are just in bullshit land. DO you think politicians arent people? Believe it or not some do do things for the people. Sorry dude but it is true. Yeah I am a pessimist too..and yeah corps have too much power, but you are going overboard.


This could be as simple Dems jumping off the teleco/cable train onto the tech train... but my guess is that it is probably worse than that.

dont be shy, expand.. what is YOUR GUESS.

and did you miss the two dems on the FCC split with weever and this was passed because the 2 republicans voted with weever. 3-2 AGAINST THE DEMS.

So please expand on how this is the dems jumping off teleco/cable and onto tech. when the dems opposed this and how this is "probably worse"


No politician does anything 'for the good of the people.'

yeah quoted twice, Strom thurmond(r) and I am very much a dem, actually personally helped me out after i got ran over by a drunk driver he got zero publicity. I saved over 80k but yeah. NO POLITICIAN EVER DID ANYTHING FOR ANYONE EVER FOR ANY ALTRUISTIC REASONS.

sorry dude they are shit, but they arent satan.

 




 no thats the opposite of what dude is doing.

I'm not here to suck Obamas dick, but nor am I hear to burn him at the stake for being worse than dick chenney. Its not complex.
 




 depends on the phone.. not all do that. 




 atm the opposite is more true, however wheeler has made it easier for competition to enter areas, so hopefully this will change. 




 actually yes, thanks obama, for appointing wheeler who turned out to not be satan and actually is doing great things for all of us. including this. See Mywifefoundmymain

 




 yeah i had similar experiences.

I emailed them once to get an idea of their user base for a debate here, and they sent me a trouble shooting form letter.

I sent another letter making fun, and got another unrelated form letter.

our CS might even be automated.
 




 well he had someone else in the car as well, so i would say no.. sounds like they are talking to someone else on the phone maybe.. but then say something assertively, followed by something else frantically. .. I'm guessing they got distracted by something. 




 not surprising with nations actually starting to talk about prosecuting deniers that know what the fuck they are doing.

we went after tobacco ceos under the rico act for constantly and knowingly lying about their own research findings into nicotine and addiction and cancer. Many of these mega corps went to the same one stop buy-a-fact-scientists heartland institute, who has never found a science it wont deny for a dollar.

I will say this, this subreddit and well all of /r/beermoney  has a long history of inventing reasons people got banned. I dont doubt there have been mistake and unfair bans and perhaps this is the cause of some of the crockery but there has definately been some crockery. heck they used to say you would get banned if you only watched funny commercials or only teh app trailers.

I seriously dont think they will ban people for using their apps, any way you can use their apps, without using other programs, and going beyond device limits. Meaning click what ever button, watch what ever video.. as long as you arent cheating through automation, or more devices, it would not only be retarded for them to care, it would be hard to design an accurate system, of banning people relaly cheating versus kids losing their phones behind theri beds while playing perk pop quiz and crap.

they arent going to ban you for using theri apps, 

5 phones per app, give them your id, no automation, no commercial skipping, upgrade when upgrades come(not an iron rule but a good one to follow) and you should be good. 




 yeah they are. And really its kinda a fact of life in business like this. Their CS on our side of the wall is going to suck balls. What do they care when such a small percentage of people they pay to.. have a problem.. they dont. CS on the advertisers side, is going to be stellar.  They will be able to ask about anything, dealing with ads.. sizes, codecs.. do they know how to convert into a form perk does like.. etc.. they are the perk income side.. our side is going to get a cursory glance and a form letter reply. Yeah they need us, but not individually.

 




 if you dont know the reference, it comes from france not backing us in the Iraqi war, and our congress making fun of france by renaming certain foods, like french fries to freedom fries.
 




 well not exactly the same since he is coming out as gay, not telling the audience to BE GAY.


if your dude said "hey guess what, turns out I love jesus" it would be more similar.

there is no gay agenda to make everyone gay.

and while I still think his speech wasnt appropriate, I dont think it is similar.

 




 and he should lose his diploma and rank.

The walmart daught just lost her diploma for cheating. 




 why it is true.. i would rather not have an establishment dem.
I also wonder about the iran/contra/bush/clinton links. The drug planes came out of arkansas.

But the media's portrayal of dems with issues against hilary.. its not as real as it sounds. AND I HAVE ISSUES WITH HILARY.


the [fact is her polling is pretty steady about  60%](http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-national-democratic-primary)

and if you [go back and look at 2008]9http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationwide_opinion_polling_for_the_Democratic_Party_2008_presidential_candidates)

Obama simply didnt have the same level of favorability in the dem party as Hilary is right now.
 














 on nice, that will work. 




 everyones been there. and it can all be hard to keep up with all.

you can get a cheap video card, i'd look for one with a hdmi out, but if just digital or vga you cna get a converter plug for a couple dollars.

you can also return the motherboard and opt for one with onboard video.. the former is better because you can upgrade the videocard when you have more money.

but yeah people here love pcs and combos, so post your ideas and you will get help and told what your missing before you buy.
 




 well since the mobo doesnt have onboard video.. did you get a video card as well?


you dont have anything to convert the hdmi into atm.

and in future, you can just post build plans here before purchase to make sure it will work for ya. 




 petitions are pretty much useless. If it is making them money, and not making them lose money(advertiser boycotts), its going to stay on the air.

and I dont mind these people exist, I just find it odd, that the land of freedom, cooking for 200+ years, has produced a society that doesnt smirk at these folks.

change the channel, like i do(before cord cutting anyways) when i see the 700 club on. Its kinda easy. Way easier than it used to be, you dont even have to get up anymore.

isnt that kinda the point? if it doesnt directly affect you, stfu and get on with your life.

i think just about every television preacher is a pure scam artist(hey some believe.. i can call him an idiot, not a scammer.) I'm offended but i would never demand they be taken off the air.. just off the learning channel :P (shows like it and channels like it)
 




 if the charger meets the specs it should work.

I'm betting the notebook has failed.

Did it run when you got it? and just now needs a charge?

if so the charger socket in the notebook is probably damaged. of caused by walking off with notebook while it is plugged in.

I have never had a universal charger not work, as long as all the specs are right, including the adaptor... but i do run into fucked up charging ports all the time.

If this is the case, then head on to youtube, search your model or google a dissembling manual. often you can see the damage on the power plug.. normally a connection has been broke.. pretty simple.., or a cap near by


 




 thats hola and thats a bit different. (fixed [link for the non mobile](http://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/37mmug/psa_stop_using_hola_vpn/))

Hola actually uses your computer and your bandwidth.

yeah they sell your data too. 

fsecure is also a very reputable antivirus corp/security corp.

their goal here, is for you to continue to use VPN after your 3 months is up, and pay them money for the privilege.

its not the same as hola and not the same as perm free VPNs and it is fsecure.. they fucking rock and have  since 1988. 

 




 I'm not.  This model isnt really that new. Its actually been tried and failed for the better part of 2 decades.

the problem is the kind of people you pay to watch ads arent the best kind of people to advertise to. Now thats not to say they dont spend money, but there are better targets than us beermoney folks.

I love to see them get bigger and better and last but its not quite the gold mine suggested.

BUT I DO AGREE WITH THE VOLUNTARY THING.. there was at least one game posted on reddit the other day, that had you watch an ad for several seconds of some power in the game. I found that to be rather unique. And I agree on phones being where the advertising is at.. just not that perk is more desirable or viable than tv, magazines.. etc.. yet..  of course I dont know what they charge and obviously they ARE GROWING.(that fact doesnt discount my previous comments, lots of pay to watch ad things grew in the late 90s, early 2000s only to die not long later)

your probably not going to see much difference from changing the wifi wavelength.. 2ghz.. yeah it can hold more data but real world says not a lot of speed difference.


5ghz doesnt play well with 2gz

wifi can be seen as an art form to get it all done well and playing well.

I suggest you repost to /r/techsupport  for better help than /r/perktv 

You dont need all that bandwidth and can save money by lowering it.

if you want to max out phones bandwidth.. which you DONT NEED as people have said.. you can get a rj45 adaptor that plugs into your phones OTG port.. and you can plug the phone WIRED into your router.. then phone will get as much speed as pc.

I just havent found a good use decorative or not for my ear hair.
 




 I think some of that anthropogenic stuff is more than damaging to science. By far most of the quantum crockery out there has to deal with that unfortunate term. "observe" when interact with is much better. And i bet most who understand the term, first heard it like everyone else, especially if they found out about it young. That the universe 'changed' simply because human eyes were looking at it.... or a gods. Like I have heard, things only happen on other planets cause god's eyes sees things and quantum theory says reality doesnt exist without eyes to see. And people with the most elementary knowledge of it all.. might at least know that unusual claims about "observation" in science and so the crock story sounds truish.

you change from observation to interacts with anything and suddenly the crocks dont have it so easy. they will still be there but science wont be helping them, just due to unfortunate terminology. (and evolution reporting is way worse, you'd think every species had yearly meetings to decide how to evolve and with a lot of thought, the giant stink plant decided to smell like bad meat to attract flies which it knew liked the smell of bad meat.. and the plant doesnt even have a sense of smell.. or a brain.. but it decided)

i know we are human and its natural to anthropomorphize and sometimes good to help people understand things, but often it can be more than misleading. 




 hmm maybe it is only after a few articles, like many. It def comes up and grays out the text.. try 3 articles i bet thats all it is. 




 it is gallup who did the survey.. and sorry its just as scientific as every poll out there. We have a good understanding of the people who wont take surveys. 

And you know this is the same bullshit certain elements of the population use to refute all polls, despite they are well proven scientifically.


Samples are weighted to correct for unequal selection probability, nonresponse, and double coverage of landline and cell users in the two sampling frames. They are also weighted to match the national demographics of gender, age, race, Hispanic ethnicity, education, region, population density, and phone status (cellphone only/landline only/both, and cellphone mostly). Demographic weighting targets are based on the most recent Current Population Survey figures for the aged 18 and older U.S. population.

see thats why you see that crap at the end. they also have quotas for region and select based on the persons whose birthday was last in the house so they dont always get the most common phone users.

sorry dude, yeah i dont like it either, but that poll is accurate. And pray tell how else would you like us to judge? just ask you?

 it shouldnt, there is actually an option in ublock to leave the spot where the ad was, but by default that isnt enabled. By default it should work just like adblock just with more options in the options.

and less overhead.

 for the 'you got to have an id to get cold medicine crowd', you'd think this would sell. But at last i suspect the same people will say making them have insurance is pure evil and against the second amendment when it says "A well REGULATED Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed." 




 red herring, no where in the article do they claim insurance caused teh decline of accidents by itself.

and they tend to listen to neither, which is when government steps in and  tell them to add things like seat belts.. which people prefer not to wear, but the seat laws have actually saved us all money because there is a socialized cost to accidents.

at any rate, while I totally agree, insurance is not the sole cause for the decline in accidents while our roads have gotten busier and busier.. but do you contend that it doesnt help?

 




 why wouldnt this be allowed? its not an exploit? I dont think we have to check every app we download.. just things like frep.

partially because they get elected to office and scream evolution is just a theory and people see these high level people who dont believe and think thats just fine and dandy.

(yeah 50% believe in evolution, which a majority of those believing in god guided evolution, which is like saying you belive the mouse found the cheese but god gave him directions through the maze.. ie science doesnt actually exist..it doesnt work if you have an outside element that can violate the laws of the universe at will) 




 It also doesnt include their fav.. fines and fees. That also go up way faster than inflation.. and often disguises the true increase in costs. When I went to college one year not only did all the fines and fees go up and we added a new few.. but they shortened the max time on meter parking to make sure we all got more tickets.
 




 not so many R's up there.

Have to wonder why rand always wears one.

Yeah yeah yeah money, elections.. but bernie doesnt wear the D.. so why does rand wear the R?
 




 I think you know when the title says climate change it means AGW.

and I am sure they do as well when polled.


you see a very similar comment in /r/climateskeptics who get tired of being called deniers.. "we believe in climate change, just that man has nothing to do with it".. and they are just trying to befuddle the debate.

and looking at your comments on cap and trade and gore, makes me more than wary about your comment. and while I dont want this comment to branch off into politics, you do know we successfully cap and traded so2 and that al gore didnt invent it and wasnt the driving force behind pushing the idea.

 




 yeah but this isnt baylor, this is the [college of faith, which isnt even a school, its a church.](http://www.sbnation.com/longform/2015/2/18/8039515/college-of-faith-profile).. the ONLY POINT, is to inject religion into sports. Thats their point of existing.. is to evangelicalism in sports. SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.. while i would totally agree and defend you 99% of the time, this isnt one of those times. 




 because you didnt learn.

What baffles me is you want us to say you learned biology when you didnt.


so what if you outperformed.. and you are still conflating the idea that your education had something to do with that and not your status.

The point is your friends who all out performed people at public school.. probably would have out performed them getting a proper education AT a public school.

the fact yall harp on this idea, without looking at what the science says is the cause, shows yall need more science education.

its the same shit that right wingers do when they look at crime reports for minorities. Yeah the science is true, problem is yalls interpretation.  Which proves you need more work in science.

and op said science diploma, not hs diploma and yeah it doesnt exist, but yeah if a college asked, it should be stated that you did NOT in fact learn the basics of biology. I dont care how bad that makes you feel. you didnt learn it. You fail. You dont get an A. Self esteem be damned. you didnt learn the subject. PERIOD.

 




 so you should get a diploma with zero knowledge of math, as long as you major in phys ed in college.

sorry your still wrong./

Besides a HS diploma from a christian school is actually probably a lot better than one from a shit inner city school where they just push students through.

and proving it time and time again, with yalls fake shit science.

here is some fake shit science right back at you.

I went to a private school.. as long as your parents paid, you got a B. Parents donated, you got an A.. I transferred to one of those POS 'inner city" schools and found out I actually had to do my homework and earn my grade. Does my one experience say anything about the true state of education? No? Nore does your horse shit unsupported science that wants to pretend the reasons why private schools do better has something to do with them and not other common factors.. like income 




 we have a basic skills test that if you fail, you dont graduate.

it doesnt matter if you PASSED every biology test. If you fail the final you dont graduate.

and yeah that includes specifics.

and colleges double check that shit when you apply. and will force you to relearn science if you dont know science.
 




 he didnt say HS diploma

and we mainly dont need to pass evolution basic skills test due to the rabid right wingers.

because evolution is basic to  a fuck ton of science, not just evolution.  




 first he didnt say HS diploma.. he said SCIENCE.

second you are wrong.

if you were taught, fucked up math all your life. 1 +2 = 4.. we should just pass you and say you knew math cause it wasnt your fault? We dont give out diplomas just to make you feel good. its supposed to represent what you know.

and its not a huge bad thing, you just should have to take HS science again in college. MUCH LIKE PEOPLE WHO ARE BAD AT MATH HAVE TO TAKE HS MATH IN COLLEGE ALL THE FUCKING TIME.

as for the bullshit about intelligence, this is one of the reasons YOU NEED A REFRESHER ON SCIENCE. See you are ignoring all the other variables that also tend to come with home schooling. Like ECONOMIC STATUS. yeah kids that can eat well can study well. And kids whose parents can afford them things like chemistry sets, encyclopedias and nice computers, well they tend to do better as well. Your problem is your taking a single stat, and putting a cause to it, which is NOT SCIENTIFICALLY BACKED AT ALL.

and even if you do "come out more intelligent".. it doesnt fucking matter. If you dont know math, you dont know math, we shouldnt say YOU DO.. and if you dont know science you dont know science, we shouldnt say you do. I DONT GIVE A FUCK HOW KNOWLEDGEABLE you are in other areas.

**YOU FAIL AT SCIENCE, YOU SHOULD HAVE TO RETAKE REMEDIAL SCIENCE.**

it has nothing to do with being mean.. it doesnt matter it wasnt your fault. SORRY But thats the facts. Saying you know a subject or dont, has fucking shit to do with being mean to you.

 




 thanks and quality post.

reminds about code, gives  answer and shows the link 




 we just gutted our mental health funding.. got to pay for those losing gay marriage and abortion lawsuits.
 




 yeah part of the reduction is husband sending car back home after he gets to work.. but i think it will be much much higher. There will be less influence to take that first plunge, and so less influence to be addicted to owning your own vehicle. And without a driver, you gain privacy.. you can talk about the dirty crap your friends are into without worry.. you can listen to your own music as loud as you want. People love to buy kids cars for college, it makes you feel good, and that your child doesnt have to depend.. and wont be stuck.. BUT I WOULD FEEL SAFER with the robot cars. My kid wont drunk drive.. he will be safe. Why buy him a car? I'm getting him an uber robot cab card...

no maintenance, no insurance and you can get the car you need when you need, or pickup truck or suv, or w/e

lowes,and walmart will deliver, amazon will be dropping toilet paper off by drones.


and in major cities your going to see a 5 minute max cab time with robot cars... its not going to be a couple times a day.. its going to be when you want it... it will be there. Heck and it will be smart and start to just come before you even call it. It knows you like to go out on fridays at 8.. so it will have a car close at 8.


 




 idk, its odd, maybe credit card reform, its harder for under 21 to get one and they def want one.. maybe they just more used to problems with the under 21. There was a lot of this at myrtle.
 




 thats actually what his 'fleet' looks like. If you notice at teh start there are at least 2 of those vans with the exact same shitty spray paint job... i'm guessing the creepy dangerous ice cream van was the look he was going for. or looking at his route they might have been going for the "please dont rob the ice cream dude, look at how broke we are" look.

 




 they are starving the beast in the states as well.

my town cut mosquito control and cut funding to mental health right when they are struggling as it is. but we sure can always find money to throw at losing social problems. 




 Look i support the dudes that defend us.. and that get shot at so I dont have to. I even support the dudes that go to our wars of aggression, its not their fault.. but i have a huge problem with making them into special saints.

why is this soldier better than a 20 year old who works soup kitchens? I'm not thinking he would get a state wide appology

it shouldnt matter if you are rich or poor, a soldier or a hood rat. It is dangerous concept to think some people in society should be risen above the rules for everyone else. And yeah that includes me.. 


that said, if we feel our kids are old enough to go to war, there really isnt anything they arent old enough to do.

 









 it looks like they banned at least one dude for staying on 2.3

well he might have rolled back. He claimed the only other  suspicious app was a perk point tracker. Just an FYI for those who try to nickle and dime theri way to higher income. 




 me i changed my passes.

you can also disable auto updates in he playstore. 




 to keep working 




 I prefer [brain games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRo8TytvIDw)

Its actually based on science and not ideology.

 




 yeah thats the problem with bullshit, the well is infinite. You see the same in creationism, where as soon as you prove how one thing evolved, they simply shift the bar. not attacking you because they is the first thought that most should have on this debunking. 




 It does 'work', based on slight involuntary movements.. it can feel creepy, and people swear by it. to prove they are wrong blindfold the people playing. suddenly teh 'spirits' cant see. 




 and people say stopping one drop from a tub is meaningless.. 1 since drop isnt even an oz, and a tub is 50 gallons or more. Stopping a single drop is completely useless and meaningless.. right? drop after drop can over flow a tub, stopping drop after drop can prevent this.

Let me guess you dont believe in it anyways. Right? or you do believe man is the cause but man cant do anything about it. Am I correct? or pray tell, what is yoru solutions besides drill baby drill? all we hear from right wingers is what is the wrong ideas, and the only ideas they offer of theri own, is increasing the us of carbon and cutting taxes for the richest of us. Thats it. nothing ever else but complaints.
 




 and beeno for cows will be invented. 




 what a crap article.

You can guess the coming spin from Team Hillary: U.S. military exports have been booming under Obama for years, and not just to Clinton Foundation donors. Theres an Obama arms bazaar going on, said one arms-control expert back in 2011. The next year, Obama set a record for weapons shipments to the Middle East. The year after that, after Hillary had left State, he relaxed military export controls further by shifting some of States duties to approve weapons deals over to the Commerce Department, which could be more flexible in approving sales to nations with dubious human-rights records. After adjusting for inflation, wrote arms-control wonk William Hartung last month, the volume of major deals concluded by the Obama administration in its first five years exceeds the amount approved by the Bush administration in its full eight years in office by nearly $30 billion. 


'you can hear hilary now, muttering the truth about how this has gone on before and after her"

well yeah.. thats what I would do when someone makes a  horse shit accusation

also there is a bit of trouble discussing teh volume of arms sales .. when talking in DOLLARS, 10 years after another comparison. Unless those dollars are adjusted for inflation, its a horse shit comparison.. just like "larges budget ever'  thats shits going to happen, in a country with an ever growing economy, and growing population.

anyways horse shit article.

plenty to dislike about hilary, still the entire right wing field is like hilary on steroids... but you have to wonder why the right love to live in bullshit land, rather than find legitimate problems.
 




 they are a well dedicated and very loud army and far more organized than the GOP.. which i know is hard to believe but it is true. They are just a much smaller group. but part of you downvote problem is reddit started off as a libertarian homeland before the /r/politics "shifted left"(no where but the US would /r/politics be considered left but hey thats where most of us are, so i accept the claim)

but yeah we both will be downvoted to hell.. even my comments pointing out that the email problem isnt a hilary problem but a government one.. Or my comment showing that 60% of dems voted against the patriot act. you would think that private loving libertarians would acknowledge and praise that.. and maybe do what i do and then point out why you dont like their policies like i do with libertarians but no they just downvote and deny.
 




 I like his stance on privacy and war.... which are both liberal ideals(sorry just look at voting history)

but he always wears an R?  Its dems alll over hte country legalizing, fighting the GOP the whole way. it is dems who dont want boots on the ground, fighting the gop the whole way.. AND IT WAS DEMS WHO HAVE BEEN FIGHTING THE PATRIOT ACT.. AND AGAINST OBAMAS REQUEST TO RENEW IT.. and fighting the gop the entire way

and yet this guy wears an R on his sleave

its almost like he doesnt care about all those things he runs on.

its almost like his main cares are low taxes and low regulation which are the forte of the GOP.

but he always runs on pot, anti war, and anti spying WHICH IS THE LIBERAL ARM OF LIBERTARIANS.
 




 actually the MAJORITY of dems voted against extending the patriot act UNDER OBAMA.

how [can yall love privacy and not know that 60% of dems voted against renewing it under Obama and it only passed because 60% of right wingers voted for it.]9http://politics.nytimes.com/congress/votes/112/house/1/376)

infact you seem to believe the OPPOSITE OF REALITY.
 




 really? really? and this guy got this main upvotes? disappointed in this sub. One it shows how hyper libertarian biased yall are, despite there is a dem fighting for privacy rights.

Nothing hilary did was unusual or against the law.

the federal records act was never properly updated for modern times.

The people in government are ALLOWED to use theri own servers.

the people in government only have to back up government business.

THE PEOPLE IN GOVERNMENT WITH THE EMAIL ARE THE SOLE ARBITRATORS ON WHAT IS GOVERNMENT BUSINESS.

it is why the irs was missing emails, [but is is also why bush and chenney, who ran their email through RNC headquarters was also missing his emails.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_White_House_email_controversy)

and why bill clinton and gore were missing emails.

it has to do with a fucked up law.. and absolutely nothing at all to do with hilary or left or right.


Seriously drop the hyper bias your ruining the point to this subreddit. Want to be political go to /r/libertarian /r/conservatives /r/progressives or /r/politics 


keep that shit out of here or fuck this place

now notice.. i pointed out from BOTH SIDES.

And[ if you want a clue about the real problem.. read this](http://www.zdnet.com/article/irs-scandal-ludicrous-claims-about-missing-government-emails-been-there-done-that/)

because only knowing the REAL PROBLEM.. can you effect change.. pretending the problem is with one single indivual who if they dont get in gov then the problem isnt there.. is just plain ignorant and yall upvoted the fuck out of ignorance.

yeah the place is fucked but the law is what needs changing. 


**YOU NEED TO KNOW REALITY TO CHANGE IT AND THE REALITY IS IT IS THE LAW, NOT HILARY.**

but I am quite sure the ignos will downvote this bipartisan proof that this is a fact. And show how totally worthless this subreddit is, if it is just going to be a campaign headquarters for rand and ignore all the other people who arent rand who are also fighting for privacy.


 




 [BoOOoOoo](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/65/f3/5c/65f35c1d022f81091b532a7a181cc97e.jpg) 




 my crappy zingers which i have been using for a longer period.. dont have any burn. Dont know why the moto-s do, but they are also refurbs so they might be pretty old.

and it is a great idea to run these phones dimmed and with as little else running... I had been but when i upgraded to loli i didnt put them dim again.
 




 these were the befrugals.. got them for only  $5 and with referals, I was basically paid to keep the phones. They are nice as hell. Never crash on quiz, very skippy.. but of course the burn problem.
 




 well on the 2 of mine that have it reboots do nothing.

1 that is really bad, i left off for days. it gets a bit warmer than the rest.. dont know if that could make the burn in last longer. But nope that didnt work for me. And if you look at the links in my other comments you will see that doesnt work for a lot of people.. hence the apps.

but thats for the advice, turning it off and on again.. its almost like the first rule of IT.  :P


 




 Tried a few burn in apps. Burn fix seems good as you can take a picture of what burned you and invert it and use that as part of the fix..

but easier seems to be to invert the colors in android settings and just running the app that burned you.


also, turning down brightness and contrast will help the burn.. and battery life.
 




 nope they do.

there are plenty of screen burn fix apps.

i can see the panda and a list of answers to the quiz and the spinning circle.

[other people claim the same as me](http://www.reddit.com/r/MotoG/comments/2d3b7q/motog_screen_burn/).. and other people claim the same as you.

but nope this is pretty strong burn.

and the fact is, no matter what anyone says, AMOLED does burn.. [here is a video of screen burn on an AMOLED.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-h98u1DzuS8)


and [here is a picture of the burn in.. i got rid of the panda mostly using an inverted panda.. going to invert the question list and spinning donut to get rid of the rest.](http://i.imgur.com/xSSY9OG.jpg)

so this is proof positive that what people hear about amoled, is full of shit. It is MUCH HARDER TO BURN but the fucker does burn :P


and [more on AMOLED burn in.. seems to be the samsung version is causing th most issues.](http://www.recovery-android.com/screen-burn-in-of-your-android-smartphone-fixed.html)

 




 I guess you know you perk too much when you can see the panda on dark scenes in movies and apps. My moto gs starting to develop burn from the perk quiz. 









 they had to the gap was too big when they took out the two women. 














 not easily.. I mean you could set up different account for each.. or run one at a time.

or use network monitors and monitor the video gets.

you coudl set them all to say funny videos.. as simultaneously as possible and then monitor bandwidth.. after an hour you should be able to tell which ones are a bit slower.

but basically your asking someone to build a system which hasnt been built yet.. so there are no options just ideas that havent been realized yet.
 
























 socialism is a big mean scary word that most americans have no clue what it means.

we as a country are mostly functionally retarded. WE got people on medicare(gov provided healthcare) protesting the idea of socialized healthcare.. its like what teh fuck do you think medicare is.. they dont fuckin know, all they know is socialism sounds similar to communism so it must be the same and evil. heck 40% of us think man lived with dinosaurs.. how the fuck we got to the moon is anyone guess.
 




 yeh no different than the one last year...
and the thing is.. THEY SUCK.. even on the special surface.. the lack of friction just ruins your abilities to really do anything.  you would need little jets in it, to help with tricks and movements and yeah that seems odd since they want their wheels to roll as smooth as possible but you need friction for the cool shit.
 




 I cant speak for others.. and am white, but i didnt like it at the statehouse. I have zero problem with people buying it.. displaying it.. what ever. You cant make people like you, the point is to not make it institutionalized by government.

and part of the point is WHY the state put it up.. it wasnt for history it was for bigotry, i dont think the dukes did it for bigotry, it really is and was prevalent around the south and not everyone was bigots that used it.. it the intentions.

There is also a black dude here who calls himself the black confederate. i dont know him, or his intentions.. but have seen him a few times. heis car has all kinds of little confederate crap all over it.. little confederate flag door locks and crap.

 




 I do find it so amusingly ironic that this little bigotshit wanted to start a race war and instead is going to end up doing something for black people the naacp hasnt been able to accomplish in decades of trying.. and they even did economic boycotts that did cost my state millions.. no one gave a fuck.

Not that he deserves any praise for all this, it is just more than delightfully ironic.
 




 wake me up when the klan flies a robert e lee.. manikin or something 




 hmm i was sure fake but now not so sure

[here are more picts and an article.](http://www.dezeen.com/2014/06/01/mirage-house-kois-associated-architects-rooftop-pool/).. and there is a home under the pool, behind that outdoor deck under the pool is a door.


[here is the guys who allegedly built it and they have some other unique designs and those are definitely real.](http://www.koisarchitecture.com/) (warning website sucks)

so to all the people who say fake... you might want to double check 




 ~~like the invisible skylight lighting up the couch under the pool.. yeah they could have a super bright light they leave on all day..~~

eh.. looked at builders site.. marking this plausible.

[here is the guys who allegedly built it](http://www.koisarchitecture.com/).. they also did build some very real and verifiable things.

it does include a floor plan.

[here is an article on the house with more picts](http://www.dezeen.com/2014/06/01/mirage-house-kois-associated-architects-rooftop-pool/)

and it was [picted up by other archi sites](http://www.designboom.com/architecture/kois-associated-architects-mirage-residence-aegean-06-02-2014/)

idk a lot looks like cgi but some picts dont, and while they say imagined, they say its on the north side of the island.. there are no good recent google earth views.. so idk.

edit: yeah that is just [designs by the firm on a house they are commissioned to build](http://www.luisaworld.com/a-pool-with-a-view/#more-8855)

but i do wonder how they are going to get to teh pool.

 




 anyone have any ban emails we can check out?

I'm not doubting and such but here we have an extreme problem with BS. Once again.. not doubting.. but you hear all the time in like the perk subs and bing subs of people all following the rules and getting banned and it causes all kinds of outrage and people freaking out but then you look and well none of it is true.. they were cheating but it ends up creating all kind of crockery where you see on here "if you bing make sure you cash in from a different ip than you search from"

as if that wouldnt actually set off a flag cause  normal people wouldn't do that.

or in perk its 'dont watch just the app trailers or get banned'

or 'dont play the perk quiz in lightning mode or get banned'

and well you see more bs about the ways to get banned than actual helpful info.

and yeah i know they can be vague, as they dont give a fuck about us.. but any kind of communication on the subject would be helpful.
 




 its crazy we have to create a fake religion to show the religious how stupid they are.. (and sorry but most satanists are fakers)..  but i think we need to flood the south with new religions.. give the people some choices, and give state houses dozens and dozens of fights over displays until they say they have to stop all religious because they cant have that many displays.

but one important thing, we got to learn from the religious(and sorry but its mainly the religious right) and get insanely upset at even the slightest thing that we can even slightly twist into an attack against us. Spell satanist with a low case S.. you are oppressing me. But we got to get really upset all the way to the sole.. (not a mispellin) like they fake they do to get their way.

you know how they are.

 dumbass "gays are evil pedophile bastards and should be put to death"

me "man thats a bit harsh, didnt jesus say love thy neighbor and shit"

dumbass "why are you oppressing my freedom of speech with personal attacks.. i cant even talk about my faith anymore without you hateful people attacking me." 




 Your question reminds me of a convo i had with a very right wing christian on reddit.

he tells me that many of his friends think the new pope is satan. That kinda shocked me to hear. Obama ok.. or chenney or someone else but the pope? Basically hes been saying the worlds got to worry about the poor more.(ok i get some things he has said are anti-right wing.. but then again anything not pro right wing is anti right wing).

you might disagree with him but you know he sneaks out at night, and washes the poor feet, and shit like that that jesus used to do. he seems like an ok dude.

dude came back that satan would fool the world by being a good dude... just like the pope.(which basically they have their bases covered cause he can be anything from insanely evil, to a really good dude)

But to make a long ramble have a point...

Even if some christians might think what they are doing is good and noble, they might still think they are actual satanists... er worship some dude called satan cause being good is exactly one of those dirty rotten things satan might do. 




 sounds like a constitutional scholar.

/s

edit: actually  the title isnt quite correct

If the couple does not want to have a religious wedding then they are free to simply file an affidavit attesting that they are married, Courser said. They can do this without ever having to have a ceremony.

A lot of states are mostly like this.. even the ones that are already legal. No one forces the priests and if you cant find one you get a notary or some witnesses and sign an affidavit...IF YOU ACTUALLY WANT A CEREMONY.. and you send this in and get your license. IF YOU DONT WANT A CEREMONY.. you can just go down to the county offices where you get the licenses and get married by a justice of the peace. This is the part he wants to change. Its still retarded and probably not legal.. but its not quite how the title makes it out to be, cause 90% of it is how it is already.. the only part is the removal of the justice of the peace for people who dont want a ceremony with friends.. people who do .. do an affidavit.. thats kinda the point of the affidavit over the justice of the peace. And i actually married some friends legally in SC being a notary. it wasnt a same sex wedding but it was a legal wedding.(its easy to keep judges out of weddings, hard out of divorses)  




 sorry its late.. gotcha you see the icon but it says disconnected.

really starting to sound like hardware failure. it can happen without having other problems on the pc, kinda rare but yeah it can happen, you can look arround the pci port you installed the card in for any damage to the board.

it really sounds like you hit all the bases from the software standpoint.
 




 ok, this might not be you, a lot of people dont see this at all.. but some of us have a reaction like you.

I used a vamo forever and 12 mg like you.. its comparable to your spinner in power. No problems, never a problem.  i got a istick50 and kangertank.. and exact same as you. it killed me. now someone else on youtube had this problem but cant find the link.. looked for someone else.. he was just a random reviewer.. it was the pg.

i switched to 100% vg, and i can vape 18mg at 30 watts(i was making someone else some juice when i went as high as 18) no problems.


its weird cause i heard of people sensitive to pg, but it never bugged me at the lower watts and higher ohms.. i can do 20% but at 50 it kills me.

but yeah also if you didnt prep the coil with liquid before you hit.. and sometimes when its flooded it can be kinda harsh. 




 in device manager, make sure 'show hidden devices" is checked under view.

and did you just try reinstalling the realtek drivers from their site? 




 my sennheiser's are the same way, except they actually hide the metal in a sheath(beats might too but from the pictures in the tear down it doesnt look that way) and sennheiser ARE quality.. so.. who wrote this shit. 




 yeah your both right wtfoosball and oldstinkfinger.

if you click [through to the actual tear down the first pict, shows it plainly](http://i.imgur.com/edjJbiQ.jpg)

both the hinge and the slide. They arent even hidden from the user it doesnt look like. Beats do suck, but this isnt why.


sennheisers have the same parts..  




 spontaneous dancing' is illegal in Sweden, and owners of bars, clubs and pubs without a special dancing license face fines if their patrons decide to take to the floor.

In March this year, politicians voted in the Riksdag to lift the bizarre ban - but it failed to pass, and Swedes still need government permission if they fancy a dance.


whoa what the fuck swedes
 




 so how does this bode for open source world? they dont exactly have to be reversed engineered. i know clamav isnt that popular but there are a lot of open source security tools.

also isnt a lot of this done by the private markets and  then sold to the nsa, i seem to recall that one browser challenge where that group that cracked all three, didnt accept the winnings because they would have to say how and they make more money selling that info to governments. 




 wait.. did they remove it?

[abortion is illegal under any and all circumstances in chili](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_in_Chile)

I dont see where it is legal even after 3900 weeks.

(and no i am not anti abortion.. just for clarity.. just a sardonic joke)
 




 I agree with you in principle but  when citizens united got ruled, its hard to deny that the amount of money spent on politics in the us went up dramatically. And while it might not be due to the same issues, its also hard to deny how far right the right went when it came to corps.(though most of this is probably due to the left moving right, making the right move further to distinguish itself) 




 i got a wheel from daniel.
 




 well i didnt doubt the facts were true. It just is more helpful if they actually adjust the dollars if they are talking about rising costs.

I don't recall any game changing medical technologies between these two timezones.

really? did you click? it goes from 1960 to 2014

MRIs were invented in the 70s// increases in cancer research, fuck we got better eye surgury and bionic limbs... that can be controled by the brain.. and kids that can hear who were deaf all theri lives.


our life expectancy in [1960 was 66 years for men 73 for women.](http://demog.berkeley.edu/~andrew/1918/figure2.html)

[today our life expenacy is 76 years for men, 81 for womn](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/10/08/us-life-expectancy-hits-record-high/16874039/)

thats an added decade in the most medically expensive time frames.

In summary: US healthcare is expensive due to predatory insurance.

dont disagree.. but there are caveats you cant ignore. IF we mislead on the other side of the spectrum we are doing just as wrong as those that pretend the insurance markets are doing us right. meaning while most of the increase can be attributed to predatory insurance, not 100% can be.

There weren't any monumental technological innovations between the two numbers It's, at best, the same as always.

but if we are looking at the same graphs you cant be more wrong on that point.. cause mine starts in 1960 and is very different than today.




fixed a link. 




 well thats why i made the point of heating it up..

but hey.. everyone in this thread says metals dont cause cancer so go ahead and downvote all teh proof they do.

and chromium can cause cancer if it was dissolved. as the first study shows. thats why i suggested a solvent in his mouth.

so while the doctor said it was possible.. he would have to take a fuck ton of heat to the mouth and have his pick vaporized or dissolved.

you also ignored the nickel part.. still its the same as the hexavalent chromium as far as cancer is concerned.. vaporized or dissolved.


no where was i suggesting holding a pick in your mouth with a magnet caused cancer'

 




 you're in cordcutters what do you care if cable tv goes up?
 




 i would love to hear how he came up with his theory. Did it have a crazy path, or did he just choose the picks and magnets right off and added a little em in there for extra measures.
 




 well if they were [chromium or nickel](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9498900) .. they could cause cancer, though its a bit hard unless you heat them up a lot. (not a doc but know those are known to cause cancer with workers who make shit out of them and there have been picks made of chromium though kinda rare) maybe a solvent in his mouth.. lol. [But there are also worries for us e-vapors as our kanthal often spews a bit of chromium and nickel. Though there hasnt been definitive proof yet.](http://www.medicaldaily.com/e-cigarettes-emit-levels-nickel-and-chromium-4-times-higher-tobacco-smoke-300704)

i kinda figured it was the tortoise shell he was going to talk about.. friend of mine used to jam.. i set him up with picks with strike anywhere match head crap glued to it and a matching sandpaper on his guitar so when he played solo it looked like he played so fast his pick caught on fire.. but anyways that smoke is pretty nasty.

edit added some sourcing.. this is skeptic after all.

edit, i guess some people missed the heating and solvent part.. i did include sources, for skeptics yall seemed to miss that too. I wasnt justifying him.. just that metals can cause cancer in certain conditions. if your going to downvote, at least tell me which words you think are false.. to vap chromium you need heat.. to disolve it you need a solvent, the link shows it causes cancer. we are hear to learn, not saying I am write, but yall havent proven me wrong by saying "it needs to be vaporized" sure and that takes a lot of heat. which is in my comment already.

 




 yeah you can.. and [there are a few vertical rebuilds.](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=kanger+occ+vertical)

for the burn, a couple things yo can do. get a tiny safety pin and put holes very gently in the side of the cotton, or use a higher pg mix which thins out the joose. also dont let juice get below the coil head. this [guy does a good video on various subtank fixes, including the dry hits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JwHQ9OYwVw)

and [you can get new heads a little over a dollar a piece at fasttech](https://www.fasttech.com/search?occ).. for generics,  $2 for authentics. 




 I'll do one more. I hate the stupid bigoted flag. i dont think it should fly at the sc statehouse. its not even historically accurate for sc.

I have zero problems with people buying that flag, flying it at their own home, while dressing in a klan uniform and burning a cross(depending on fire laws)

i have zero problem with walmart selling it if they wanted to.

edit:so yall disagree? what part? that i called the flag bigoted? it wasnt used in sc besides by the klan and to protest the civil rights era, sc used the palmetto. or do you just disagree that bigots should be able to buy it? Just downvoting and not explaining yourself besides against reddiquette is pretty low effort in debates.

 




 At first i was going to dismiss this out of hand.. as there seems to be little relation and i have been through many loses and i have never been stimulated by the loss.

however, when you win, you often go otu to celb.. if you arent already out watching the game. when you lose you go home.. or stay there. So i can actually see their conclusions as a scientifically valid guess.(i am not sure they accounts for all variables like perhaps a well known uab college girl had some pron post up or maybe she broke up with half the people at UAB.. eitherway that would probably increase views) 




 two points i made in a different sub.. with this post.

1. you can partially blame documentaries that call ostriches living dinosaurs.. and that fish i forget the name of atm.

2. 1/3 of the country does not believe in evolution at all even "god guided evolution"  but do believe that dinosaurs existed and some believe in the time scales.. they 'simply' dont believe in evolution, so humans had to exist at the same time.

this isnt a justification, just a look at the areas we need to work on.

but really i would like to see a fuck ton of work on how we do science documentaries. IF you say living fossil or living dinosaur you best let them know you dont actually mean an actual live dinosaur, just that this creature resembles its ancestors a lot.

also get rid of all the anthropomorphism when talking evolution.. you are making things worse. No animal plans evolution and yet EVERY SINGLE SOLITARY Documentary suggests they do. the corpse plant didnt decide to smell like rotten meat.. the corpse plant doesnt even fucking know or have any way to know what rotten meat even smells like. If there was any planning.. it was done by the fucking flies.


no fucking animal said, hey them low leaves are all getting eaten.. wouldnt it be better if we had long ass necks to eat the ones on top? no the ones with short fucking necks died out quicker than they could breed and the ones with the long necks didnt so rthe fucking necks got longer.. no fucking planning. Its hard to really blame the religious when it comes to the shit state of our evolution reporting.. we make it sound like an intelligence is behind it.. just a scientific one.. that sounds a lot like what the religious claim and its not anywhere near the accurate.

the only time an animal 'decides' its evolution is through sex display but even then, their isnt a lot of deciding going on, on the evolution side.. you know we might like big tits and tits got bigger but we didnt decide to make women have bigger tits.. ok mans a bad example cause we can do that now.  but the point is there is no conscious decision to evolve. God or not.

 500,000 years? eh.. pretty much do everything we do here on the planet earth rn now would be good enough.

edit: take it back, I'm not quite sure that would be enough, the pressure is way low and i dont know enough about all we add to the atomosphere. 




 yes unplug it so it boots to windows over the usb stick 




 name the boner killer/.

next week, the friends of these 13-14 year olds who have trouble getting condoms of their own but seem to invent new ones... are going to invent the prank version that changes color when it contacts any pussy. Ahhh good times good times

 




 "It has nothing to do with the flag, nothing at all," he said.

well except the flag wasnt ever used in SC except by the klan and to fight civil rights  100 years after the civil war.. it is solely a symbol of bigotry.. unlike the african american monument.

Plus the man sorta admits his bigotry.. its one thing to not support the removal of the flag but the fact that he wants to remove an african american monument as payback for removing his, shows he is overly bigoted. when both sane black people and sane white people want it taken down.


"My great, great, great grandfather and ancestors fought in this war for this state," he said.

and lost. Yall keep forgetting that part. YALL ROSE UP AGAINST THESE UNITED STATES THAT YALL CLAIM TO LOVE SO MUCH... AND FUCKING LOST. and it wasnt put up on the aniversity of the civil war. It wasnt put up to honor the civil war. It isnt even accurate to sc's position in the civil war. It was put up to fight segregation and the people who put it up said it was due to the north wanting to force desegregation despite god always intended the races to be separate.


there are people here who emigrated from germany after the war.. should we fly nazi flags for them?


You heritage freaks dont have a leg to stand on.. it wasnt put up to honor heritage and if we wanted to honor heritage we would have used the SC confederate flag over the virgina one. It was put up for bigotry.

PS challie chapin had a tooth brush mustache, but wear one today, and people are going to assume you are a nazi. Is that fair?  probably not but like it or not, people are that offended because the last person to use it was a raving bigot. Same with that stupid ass flag. Douche bag knows damn well why it was put up.

and even.. lets just say this asshole is dumb enough to believe it is soley heritage and states rights.. this assholes rose up agains teh US, killing many us citizens and lost.(many in texas fought for the mexican side.. of that war.. should they get to put up the mexican flag over government buildings in theri town? FUCK NO.. THEY LOST). you can argue if it is right or wrong we still have that land today, but you cant argue it isnt part of the US. Same with teh south, lose the flag of the enemy.
 




 well while i dont doubt it is still true.. for a bunch of reasons. that stat is meaningless unless adjusted for inflation.

hey i could be missing it but i dont see anywhere it says it is listed in constant dollars.

But also healthcare gets more expensive as we learn new methods of keeping you alive for longer and will go up regardless of inflation.
As well as the fact we live longer. 




  That being said people are really hard for robots to work on. They move quickly and are all unique.

not as big of a problem as you think anymore. WE have robots now that are learning to be smart enough to deal with totally unique, never seen before situations.. like the differences in humans or the differences in folding random clothes tossed in a box.
 




 I'm not sure if this is totally true. Well maybe from a data standpoint but darwinian evolution says giraffes where had longer necks survived because they had more access to food.. etc.. where id says god decided he wanted some long ass necked animals.

the main difference to me.. scientifically is one is semi predictable, the other isnt.

i know that on small landmasses animals tend to be smaller.. where in id, you got to guess that god wanted some cute smaller versions of certain animals and decided to place them on islands. 

or the all female lizards that clone themselves.. darwinian evolution says they will most likely have problems and that its not a good evolutionary strategy to live as clones.. god guided says nah, if god wants to the lizard to survive it will.. doesnt matter its evolutionary state.
 




 I dont have the data on hand, but yeah this phenom is well studied and if i remember correctly the percent of snarks seems to be rather steady. But it is a well known problem and if you look at certain gallup survey type polls(not so much on do you approve of such and such job), and read their little disclaimer on the bottom they specifically mention things like this. And that the poll is adjusted accordingly.

sometimes as simple as asking the same questions over with different wording, as snarks often forget what they said to the last one 20 questions ago.

also, you cant really blame them to much.  Documentaries often call birds, especially ones like the ostriches as living dinosaurs. [Though i highly suspect it has more to do with our beliefs in evolution where 1/3 fully reject the idea, most believe in god guided evolution, where only 15% believe in darwinian evolution.](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/08/060810-evolution.html).. see they might accept creatures die out just not that new ones are created, "therefore man must have existed in small pockets with dinosaurs".. 




 the [difference between sun and shade in teh vaccuum of space is about 275 degrees ](http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/nasas-spacesuits-allow-astronauts-to-work-in-an-extremely-tough-environment/2011/09/12/gIQA37SsfK_story.html)

this is with no steps, this is front and back of the suit.
 




 someone more artistic than me needs to redo the reddit logo for this sub to have that haircut. 




 unfortunately just looking at the username.. i suspect not.

And i will take this time to mention that this is a systemic and wholly republican problem. And part of the divisive issues at hand.

They talk about real americans.. versus..

they are patriots .. versus..

they need to take back this country... versus...

and dems generally dont do that. We dont question peoples patriotism, besides we think patriotism is stupid. we believe in right versus wrong, not blindly supporting government actions which seems to go away as soon as their is a dem president. And we definitely dont pretend even the craziest of republicans arent "real americans" Thats not to say we can hurl some bombshells. I do al the time.. but its a bit different with the GOP as they do seem to see anyone not GOP as "not a real american".. "not a patriot" and someone "we need to take out country back" from.
 




 get what you say but when they didnt have voting rights its kinda meaningless.

yes considering blacks less of a person for purposes of representation cause the southern states to have less power.. but how about considering them 3/4th a person as far as representation but then no vote.. well in that case you are really giving the slave holders more power, per person they owned. because the slave owner was the only one with the vote.. so each white slave owner in teh south, had more power than each individual white non slave owner in the north.
 




 or i didnt have any trouble so no one else should have.

(and really everyone over 50 you can say fuck off with this..[in 1978 a summer job at min wage could pay for a year of tuition](http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/national/politifact-the-meme-about-the-summer-of-78-and-college-tuition/2192477) they dont even know what a hill looks like much less walk up one both ways. And raising min to $10 isnt the same because some things like college rose faster than inflation)
 




 well i take some exception. While he literally wouldnt care after the fact of his death, before death, i might have some cares about my body being used after my dead to further some of these bullshit things.  Like i am an organ donor.. i will be dead and wont give a fuck at that time.. but while i am alive i think of good things being done with my discarded parts and it would disturb me to think bad things were done.. yeah its just a baptism, but it still supports and furthers their nonsense even if it wasnt my choice. 




 it is bizarre  even for the religious right, to see them trying to claim they are actually the victim.  Silence or indifference would have been a ton better than claiming.. no really it wasnt anti black it was anti christian.

thats like saying hitlers goal was to rid germany of germans.

its hard to see anyone willing with a straight face to go on the press and say these things and yet we seem to have a line of them.

i guess over the past decade or so they have learned they can say pretty much anything with impunity in the media.
 




 they [having issues atm](http://status.perk.com/)

working on it i guess. 




 [perk status](http://status.perk.com/)

dont tell you shit but

normally when shits kinda fucking retarded it will say shits ok.

right now it says shits not ok, thats why things re extra fucking retarded right now.
 




 and the multi tier justice system still exists.
 




 sorry but if wearing underwear.. even without moving it to the side, you can actually have your anus penetrated.. underwear stretches a bit.. its not an iron shield.
 




 it can be automated... something this huge would take a lot of cpu to do it, but it can be automated fairly easily. 




 after the political winds changed.  

Sorry but shes a raving opportunist.

She first tried to say we wont ever be able to explain why he did this despite his own words.

when directly asked about the flag she said the people of sc had this discussion already and i suspect we will have the discussion again... nothing about it being bad.. matter of fact she did the politician thing of avoiding giving her view on it.

it wasnt until it became an issue to have the opposite view did she come out to ask for it to be removed.

Still I will take what I can get.  Its good she is calling for it to be removed even though she is only doing so for political reasons. And sorry but thats a fact. She was leading the charge in the right winger denial machine until teh GOP started taking heat for pretending it wasnt to do with racism.
 




 luckily some of the worst of them are dying off. not wishing ill will or celebrating their deaths, just the inevitable march of the human race.

but since i am dissing my state, theres a lot of good hearted kindness down here as well. my aunt moved to a small town here and i swear pretty much the entire town stopped by over the first 3 days welcoming her there and dropping off food gifts from their farms.
 




 I'll tell my one story that bugged me. Working in a resteraunt this young man came in, rather timid looking, for some lunch. There wasnt a lot going on so i talked to him a bit. He was from a small town in nowhere sc and had never been out of it before, but he had managed to get a scholarship to usc, was put on a bus and sent to columbia and he was kinda overwhelmed by the entire place and being their alone. To him columbia was a huge intimidating city. Well some of my bosses friends came in and they were sitting at the bar and started to crack racist jokes plenty loud enough for that kid to hear. And he actually cried. I paid for his meal felt bad as fuck for the kid. and as typical my boss and his friends would always claim to not be racist in the least. my boss would normally "no one can call me a racist i hirer a bunch of them" and things like that.. sigh.

the bigot has since passed on. idk about his friends.

and if you dont know about columbias infamous racist, [maurice bessinger, its an interesting story. man gave up millions just to keep being a public asshole.](http://www.charlestoncitypaper.com/HaireoftheDog/archives/2014/02/24/maurice-bessinger-bbq-baron-and-unrepentant-racist-dies)

he's also passed on, different bigot though from the first story.
 




 well see, its not even [historically accurate to the war.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flags_of_the_Confederate_States_of_America)

the only flags the actual confederacy used liked it, was a white banner with the modern confederate flag, similar to where we put our stars.(and yeah people thought it looked too much like a surrender flag, but they said fuck it and used it anyways)

it was the flag of northern virginia regiment and tennessee regiment.

it you look the SC confederate flag, is quite different.. the palmetto confederate flag. The only time the flag in that form came into popularity was when it was adopted by bigot groups. Thats its history in sc. Not the war.. in the war we used the [palmetto confederate flag](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/South_Carolina_Sovereignty-Secession_Flag.svg/440px-South_Carolina_Sovereignty-Secession_Flag.svg.png)(besides it is based on the confedderate flag it is probably the coolest one). If it was about heritage and not hate, why didnt they use that one?

now I am not saying it hasnt evolved some to mean something to some people who arent bigots. but its based on a bastardization of history.

 




 well thats not necessarily a bad thing, that was about the stupidest stache you can grow. 




 sounds like before, since they nabbed him in his truck in line to get into the event. Which makes me wonder if he will get out with a truck still full of trash. I dont really see them doing the work for him..so i suspect so. 




 that had to be a fun roller coaster for him.

"ooo cool a new miley interview"

"hey, dude with the record... omg shes talking about me!!!!!"

"FUCK"
 




 because they didnt read either.
 




 Though your comment is probably a legitimate compliment, this is the net, so i cant be sure. However I am quite sure he was being purposefully ironic, since the only uncommon word he used was the one he used to describe _leftist. And yes it is quite humerous. 
 




 Hes been spotted at a craft brewers conference, with several laptops going at once, processing multiple beer labels simultaneously. Ive never seen anyone working as hard as him, said Scott Newman-Bale, who works with Shorts Brewing Company.

idk, sounds like they found a real aspey. 




 i need to see the other side 




 i am am not sure she can say there is no tipping point..eventually you can actually get enough where it is a chore to try to spend it.. not sure how you could say that more would make you happier when you cant spend what you have.


but yeah anyways the first study never claimed that it stopped at 75 but that that was the peak of happiness gains in changes of income. that after 75k each 10k more is less changing than under 75k
 




 i agree but unfortunately i dont see it coming down this time. The legislators have already said they wont be able to take it up til december.. when many people are more concerned with holidays than politics. and due to the agreement last time.. it will take a 2/3rd majority to get it down.


nah that things staying up. By december they wont have the political will.
 




 really? 

honest question, would you find it unusual to read a story about a holocaust survivor burning his neighbors nazi flag? i mean would you think the jewish guy was mentally unstable and not of the norm of society for doing such an act?


i recall fox news getting upset at a mexican flag flying over a post office in a mostly spanish town in the us.. despite that town used to be part of mexico and it was part of their heritage(personally i agreed with fox.. it had no place flying over the post office)

and [then is this lady who stole the mexican flag from a e mexican grocery  because this is america not mexico](http://www.rawstory.com/2015/02/muslim-hating-mexican-flag-stealer-delivers-bizarre-anti-tyranny-prayer-to-the-tenn-senate/)

so i suspect people can and do get upset at symbolism especially if they think it is designed to offend them.

it might just be a flag to you, but perhaps it offends some a bit more when its presented by the government.
 




 wow there is a concerted efforts by america conservatives to discredit and downplay the pronouncements of this pope despite he follows up with action every time. Heck one guy below says the pope is the antichrist because he does good things and thats just what the antichrist would do to deceive us.   he'd much rather have a pope hate and gays and muslims and say wealth is a god given blessing and poverty is god hating you.
  




 they cover commercial sellers at gun shows. Please stop with the NRA talking points bullshit.

[Generally, gun control advocates want to extend background check requirements to private sellers at gun shows. Gun rights advocates say there is no loophole, and believe any federal law requiring background checks for sales of secondary market firearms between private citizens, whether at gun shows or not, would exceed the government's authority, be a prelude to gun registration, and endanger gun owners' Second Amendment rights.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_show_loophole)

HEY WE CAN HAVE THIS DEBATE, but if you want to act like a dumb ass while claiming I dont know what the fuck I am talking about then their is no fucking point.

there is a gun show here.. I can go there and buy a gun with zero background check as long as the seller is a private citizen. However i cant buy a bottle of liquor from my neighbor as a minor. ITS A LOOPHOLE.. AND YES I DO KNOW WHAT THE FUCK I AM TALKING ABOUT.


here is a [FUCKING MAP of the places that allow you to buy without a background check from private sellers at gun shows](http://www.governing.com/gov-data/safety-justice/gun-show-firearms-bankground-checks-state-laws-map.html)

YOU SIR ARE A SHILL OR IGNORANT.. take your pick. .i come with sources.
 




 ahh so jesus was an antichrist.. got it.

i mean he did good things.

obviously the only way to not be the antichrist is to not give a fuck about the poor. and be as greedy as fuck.

seriously dude, you are covering the entire human spectrum with your antichrist comment. he can be pure good and then turn evil.. thats what satan does. LOL

you friends are still idiots dude.

he sounds more like jesus,, than ted cruz does.. sorry dude but its true.

 




 did he make the sword or buy investments in the sword manufacturer?? well you cant read either,.

sure good at coppying quotes from the bible, why cant you copy the quote from the title of this submission?

**you know how easy it would have been for him to include weapon owners in his quote?**

strange he didnt huh,.
 




 old testament doesnt count.. well until we say it does and then it does and when we dont want it to count it doesnt counts again. magic. 




 he said investors and manufactures, not soldiers or owners.. but hey.. its ok if you cant read.
 




 so rand paul cant denouce war because the us has made a lot of wars.

got it.

also didnt know germany was still so nazi and anti jew.. cause obviously nothing ever changes.
 




 no one said you couldnt own them.

but apparently yall cant read.
 




 anti christ? for cleaning the church of pedos, saying to help the poor, and saying we should make war less? Yall have a strange view of christianity.

and funny yall all seem to kbnow what jesus said, but yall never seem to be able to actually read WHAT TEH FUCKING POPE SAID.

he didnt say you cant own a gun.

and seriously anyone who says he is the anti christ is no christian.. they might disagree with teh dude, but come the fuck on.. he said help the poor, and has brougth pedos to court, cleanign up the church.. he has slapped down teh super rich bishops.. hes actually doing shit to help people.

people who say he is the anti christ sound like some evil ass motherfuckers.
 




 well except he is actually putting his money where his mouth is.
people keep screaming pr when he opens his mouth and then he goes and does something like set up a pedo court and start sending high level preists and those who hid them to the court.

its a bit more than PR.. is a progressive pope.
 




 what weapon war?

but yes christians in the past and today are hypocrits.. wahts the point? do you disagree with his pronouncement? 




 no they are not.. that was an internet lie.

beretta is solely family owned, and believe it or not people buy enough guns they have never needed investors. fucking crazy i know.
 




 and he didnt say dont own a gun. Some of you conservatives have a hard time reading.

did you make that sword? did you help the sword maker find money to open his shop? no? he wasnt talking to you.

NO WHERE DID HE SAY YOU CANT OWN A GUN.

if he did he would say "who manufacture weapons or invest in weapons industries AND GUN OWNERS are hypocrites if they call themselves Christian"

nice failure with the bible verse.. maybe if it had something to do with what he actually said.
 




 you have a source that it was illegal by the catholic church for catholics to not invest into weapons manufacturers before this? this is the first i am hearing about this and I really would like to read it.


either way, you do know the church still says shit like "gay marriage is bad" I'm quite sure most of the religious know how the church feels.. so why do they still repeat it? 




 Why? Ok so you are going to comflate the pedo thing with the gun thing?

or are you talking about reparations for a war before most peoples births?

sorry but I disagree. This pope speaks, people like you come every single time and say bullshit and every single time he proves yall wrong by actually doing something about what he said he was going to.

I guess you mean the catholic church needs to return the shit it got from the musollini during wwii.. or he is a hypocrite. cause musollini used guns?

if rand paul is elected president, can he no longer complain about war? I mean america has a bit of a history with war? maybe we need to give recompense to every nation we ever .... um freed against theri will.. before we let rand denounce war.. cause you know america has a history.

I agree with you, we need the debate about the ILL GOTTEN GAINS of the church. 10000% you are fucking correct.

But him being a hypocrit until he fixes everything we perceive wrong with the church before he is allowed to speak? nah thats just crazy talk.


 




 he did.

he even has made drastic changes to the church to stop that.

I dont get why so many of yall are ignorant about this.

It was like a year of posts on reddit.

1. [he admitted the church had pedos at the highest level.](http://www.religionnews.com/2014/07/14/pope-francis-raises-eyebrows-saying-pedophile-priests-include-bishops-cardinals/)

2. [he is trying to end celebecy DUE TO PEDOS.. he thinks it will help.](http://www.catholic.org/news/hf/faith/story.php?id=59123)

3. [he set up a special court to bust the church pedos](http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/06/10/pope-creates-tribunal-to-hear-cases-bishops-who-fail-to-protect-kids-from/) and THOSE WHO HIDE THEM. says [ZERO TOLERANCE IS THE ONLY WAY FORWARD.](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/pope-francis-calls-u-s-churches-stupid-article-1.1295178)


the church is full of pedos and YES THIS POPE.. that yall keep trying to find gotchas to.. is actually and IN REALITY.. trying to fix that. This was pretty much his day one shit dude. It was realy his first pronouncements as pope. It what got people talking about him in the first place.
 




 we could ask, but i suspect it would depend on the situation.

and then their is the whole render onto caeser thing.. where he might realize that they dont have much of a choice and that the government cant force you into sin.
 




 you mean the fake berreta story? cause you know it was fake? they dont have holdings into berreta.
 
but so far this pope has put his money where his mouth is.. people said the same thing when he came out and admitted the church was chock full of pedophiles at the Highest level. People on reddit said .. yeah sure thats good and all(it was a fucking amazing first step fucking admitting it) but where is the action.... and then he set up a court to start trying them fuckers and restructured the church to stop shipping them off to the infamous pedo churches and such.

believe it or not this pope seems to be the real deal. I still dont agree with everything about him, but i like what he is trying to do and he is ACTUALLY TRYING TO DO IT. its not just feeding people what they want to hear.

and I'm a total atheist, so i have no pro catholic bias here.


 




 This is our problems with right wingers like yourself.

WE say.. "hey it might be a good idea if those background checks also cover gun shows.. seems like a huge hole to us"

you come back "LIBERALS WANT TO TAKE MY GUNS AWAY"

no one said that.

The pope didnt ask you to get rid of your gun.

did you make it yourself? NOPE.. he wasnt talking to you.

do you sell guns? NOPE he wasnt talking to you.

do you invest in the makers of guns? nope he wasnt talking to you.. and no just buyign a gun isnt an investment into the makers not by how he is using the term.
 




 you hunt deer with a hand gun?


then you shouldn't be called a "hypocrite" no matter what religion you go by.

I dont make the rules for catholics, and he doesnt make the rules for all christians BUT HE DOES MAKE THE RULES FOR CATHOLICS.. so if you happen to be one, I suggest you either accept it or become something else.  Its hypocritical in his eyes for catholics. TO INVEST IN MANUFACTORS OR BE A MANUFACTURER of guns. Which neither you claim to be. so Even if you are a catholic, it sounds like you are ok.

you should read what he says and not claim he says something else. 

**Absolutely no where did he said you cant own a gun as a catholic.**
 




 nope.. total horseshit.

its a totally family owned business.

They really have never needed investors.
 




 well except them rich liberals.. raised min wage, gave us the consumer financial protection agency and while it isnt single payer, they gave us much needed health reform which the right is dead set against and slowly but surely liberals have been forcing state governments to stop arresting its citizens for smoking a dead plant.

and liberals a little bit less gun hoe about sending boobs on the ground to fight stupid wars.

but other than that your right, they are exactly the same.

PS a third party is idiotic, until we fix the very thing that causes them to not be function. see DUVERGERS LAW and the problem with first past the post voting. Oh we might successfully vote in a new liberal party or a new conservative party and in 4 years it will look like the old one. See duverger.
 




 sorry that was found out to be complete horseshit.

[bereta is soly family owned by the beretta family..](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Beretta) wikipedia

you will notice you wont find your info anywhere besides non mainstream sites, they all use the same source, which no longer exists.


i dont doubt there is shit in their investments we can attack.. this isnt one. 




 not more than catholics. But yeah we like the new pope, hes better than the old pope. but you do know the republicans would be quoting him to high heaven if he said wealth is a sign of blessing from god, or that muslims must be stopped from getting a nuke.


edit; downvote but no debate.. you dont think catholics follow this pope as much as reddit? or do you disagree that republicans would have less of a problem with him if he spewed republican talking points?
 




 Romney was probably [the only republican calling for it to be removed back in 2012](http://www.mediaite.com/online/mitt-romney-denounced-flying-of-confederate-flag-while-gingrich-defends-it/). i give him extra points, despite being an obama voter, because he took this stand in the face of his party and their was no shootings going on at the time.

its something the GOP get asked about every election. its just not as big of news outside of sc. 




 bulls dont get asked before we take their semen..

cows dont get asked before we artificially inseminate them.

I get one is done from a clinical mindset and one is sexual mindset.

but what if the farmer enjoys it? How do we word the law?
 




 well thats what the article suggests.. that all she did was get on her knees 




 Well people arent all the same, have the same views or cultures. And frankly, even you have admitted you cant successfully argue why it is wrong, though you blame a lack of coffee. The people you are talking to.. they dont think its right, they just demand a coherent argument on why it is wrong to justify the laws. laws shouldnt be made on feelings. 




 before he died for your burger... he had a different life.

and the second part.. [putting it in another cow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yvXowLh-Pg)

the cow did more than just die for your burger.

and for an unrelated bonus.

fear factor .. [the donkey semen episode.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zk6KiP7iQgo)




 




 no he related it to something that would be considered a sexual act under other contexts.

he also missed that prized bulls tend to get hand jacked off to see off the seman..  The question posed to you, is what is the difference and can you make a legal description of the difference between a girl jacking off a dog, and a farmer jacking off a cow.

its a fair question

 




 can you jack off a horse?

perhaps it isnt coffee thats failing you?

and no one said it was right, just that perhaps it shouldnt be illegal. The two concepts arent synonymous. I dont think it is RIGHT what Westboro baptist is doing, but i dont think it should be illegal.

see?
 




 while that might happen in those cultures, it didnt happen in this one as the state of the media was in decline long before the net became popular.
 




 idk, [does that turret only shoot defensive bullets?](http://boingboing.net/2008/09/02/south-carolina-sheri.html)

I know i know i will look so foolish when the russians invade columbia sc.
 




 yeah thats the point.. there were restrictions added.

But try to close the private show loophole or reinstate the assault weapons ban and they pretend you are hitler. 




 I'm glad i am not the only one.. i used to think i must have really strangely shaped ears. now I just think their is a conspiracy and everyone else glues theirs in.

I finally got some with different size ear things.. i thought FINALLY.. but naw they all fall out, unless i am totally motionless and in the vacuum of space.

did the rest of yall evolve like little ear fingers to hold onto them things? I mean i read on questionable sites that people actually jog wearing earbuds. This is totally implausible.

I may try some of your ideas, but i'm not really sure yall all dont work for the secret anti-headphone consortium, trying to ruin peoples experience with headphones by flooding the markets with these earbud things and giving everyone a bad experience making them go back to stand alone speakers.

 




 I'm not sure "fool" is the perfect word here. Luxury doesnt have to mean quality, it can simply mean something others cant afford. Case in point, the people who bought that $1000 iphone app which put a crystal on the display. No one was fooled. No one thought it was coded by stephen hawkings. No one thought eh crystal graphic was designed by banksey... so why did people buy it? because most people couldnt afford it.

fooling people is when they say those special hdmi cables play audio better and crap. Those people are being lied to.

 




 its a lot easier when you are in slow motion like that. 




  Have we had a conversation to know why people respect this icon enough to have it displayed so prominently?

we can but they wouldnt like it. It has exactly zero history with SC besides the klan and put up for opposition in civil rights era. 

might have a point if we used the sc confederate flag and put it up like say 200 years after fort sumter.. but no.. it was put up to protest integration. It was 100% put up there for racist reasons. Anyone who invokes heritage is lying.


here is the wiki on the confederate flags of america.. notice there is no THE CONFEDERATE flag...and not once did the confederacy actually have that as a flag. 2 regiments had that particular flag as the flag.. yes it was part of the design of the confederate flag.. but it wasnt the flag. So historically they arent even being accurate.


bigotly, they are. 




 you sure get riled for someone with no opinion.. who dont care if it stay or go. You say it will have no effect and yet people here are obviously offended by it. So you should have no problem... that is if you really dont care either way. I sure  wouldnt. And normally when i dont care either way..  i dont even say anything because.. i dont care.

I'm sorry if you can grasp that state sponsored racism my effect society. But hey symbols have zero power so lets put the nazi flag up in jewish areas all over the world.. they cant be offended cause its just a symbol

**PS when the bigots lost SA.. they took down the flag.** 




 so you would be ok with a region of germany putting up the nazi flag after a group of jews moves in for "history and heritage"


got it.

this from the same groups of people who actually punch salvation army volunteers for saying happy holidays to them

how is it yall seem to get offended at the smallest things like people wishing you well, but cant seem to understand that people can be offended by a flag that has been used by bigots and hate groups for 100 yearss?
 




  No group of white people thinks its okay to go into a troubled northern black community and try to convince them that maybe they're doing something wrong to produce a generation of kids who idolize the thug life.


really? turn on fox, tell me how many times they mention the thug life in chicago a day.


like Christians have done with the WBC

they really havent.. not from a christian perspective.. most of the protestors have come from people like the hells angels.


 




 I asked my Dad (history buff) why they keep the flag on capital grounds. He summarizes and tells me that's it's a reminder of our past. That we once held a belief and fought for it. And blood was shed to defend our lifestyle.

your dad, needs to work on his history.

First that flag was never a flag of the confederacy.. it was the flag of only two regiments one in va and one in tenn. 

now the [palmetto confederate flag does have some history in SC but we didnt use that one.. we used the one that was NEVER ADOPTED BY THE CONFEDERACY.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flags_of_the_Confederate_States_of_America)

now yes most flags of the confederacy did incorporate the design into their flags but IT IS NOT A FLAG OF THE CONFEDERACY.

So it was mainly used by 2 regiments.. and nothing big of famous about them. IT got wide spread use by the klan and other hate groups after the civil war. THATS THE ONLY HISTORY SC HAS WITH THAT FLAG.

it wasnt part of the confederacy.

Now.. when did we embrace this history? When the federal government told the south they had to desegregate in the 1950s.. and the south decided to threaten civil war by putting that flag up all over the south.. 

It wasnt put up for history or heritage.

it was put up for bigotry.

SC has no history or heritage with that flag

the confederacy doesnt really have a history with that flag.. it is a small part of the design

the only places that do besides va and tenn is the klan.

So i respectfully ask your dad to rebuff his history.


it is was about heritage we would have had the palmetto confederate flag out there, but it wasnt, its about bigotry, which is why it was put up during the civil rights era and also why we couldnt make mlk a holiday without making confederate day a holiday, as if the two things have anything to do with each other besides race.



 




 freaken amazing all the terrain that walls goes over.. and this was all built without massive trucks hauling all that material to people. 




 wow he is correct.

but perhaps it isnt 'screw you over and limit"

but good knowledge of their equipment and once you reach about 20 devices people would start having problems.

And the problem with this, is people often blame the wrong thing. Like if theri phone is dropping net.. they might say "this google internet is complete shit.. web sites keep timing out"

when it isnt the net, they just have overloaded the cheap router google gives out with theri fiber.

so they arent trying to be dicks, they are sorta trying to be like apple. They are protecting users from themselves.

ahh from google.. yeah this sounds like what it is.

The Network Box supports a maximum of 16 wireless devices. As the number of connected devices approaches 16, however, performance degrades dramatically.

after 16 the router is probably complete shit.. like some people experience here in perk with 15 phones. 




 most crashes, freezes seem to be server side.

with the ups and downs of perk, its kinda impossible to make proclamations or find things like this without real scientific testing and not "i feel" or "yesterday my phones crashed and today they didnt"

not picking but its too variable.. you need to do longer tests. And your hypothesis is missing a why this might work.

i suspect there were other reasons for your successes.

not trying to be a jerk or come down on you, but the entire /r/beermoney network is full of BS and sudo science and well it gets tiring weeding through the snake oils to find reality.(not that random fixes is as bad as ..dont watch app videos only.. or you will get banned.. always redeam your bing from a different ip than you searched.. and other totally 100% bs things that actually make it in the faqs and crap) 




 at most it should help bootspeed.

thats it. 




 well i wonder if that part has more to do with people who have an entire farm and never touch the computers.. versus most of us who do this on our own computer.. not sure if you have to actually interact with the site.

bear with me.. see if it was for ALL OF US.. to make it really not passive.. all they need is a 'are you still watching" pop up. Its kinda easy. The fact they are going to do this by behaviors suggests they arent trying to stop all of us, just the mega abusers. I could be wrong but thats how i read it.
 




 well not sure about that.. most beermoney things start off a bit loose on the rules and with high payouts.. they have to get a critical mass of users as quick as possible so they can charge big bucks for ads.

every single one will slowly tighten the rules and slowly reduce payouts to a point where they hope to balance concerns of advertisers and keeping users. 




 certain areas  isnt the same word as certainty.. but I suspect you knew that but didnt want to respond to the guys actual comment. WEll that or you arent familiar enough with english to comment on the topic.

anyways certain areas are having a bad time in LA right now

[Los Angeles Will Literally Take Your Car Away If You Don't Drive It Every Three Days](http://la.curbed.com/archives/2015/03/los_angeles_72_hour_parking_towing.php)

maybe OP knows some of these people.

And you know different people do different things and go different places at different times and might have a different experience than you.. CRAZY I KNOW.

but like it or not, people do get towed in LA and you cant say OP doesnt know people who have been towed once a year.

[Bill to Protect Motorists From Predatory Towing Clears House](http://articles.latimes.com/2005/mar/10/local/me-predatory10)

AND THAT I AM CERTAIN. 

and please take the time to read the comments to the articles i linked, these are LA residents that disagree with you. no they arent calling you a liar, they just have a different experience with being towed than you do.
 




 well this is the net.. so.. askign why people lie is a bit silly.

And no one accused you of lying.

I simply asked a question.

as for "i suspect you dont live in these areas" (You know it can be different for someone who lives in an area versus someone that visits?)

I mean I suspect you dont live in the areas you say are known to be hard to park in. You didnt claim to, so you cant claim i am calling you a liar. tell me, have you lived in every single district in LA? So some you havent lived in huh? The people there might have a different experience than you?
 




 once a year might be a bit high.. but you scoff a bit much as if he just said the earth was only 6000 years old. And then you even admit there are certain areas that are incredibly difficult to park.. i suspect you dont actually live in these areas.
 




 You left off some key info.

whats your PSU.
 




 he doesnt have to point at israel. States with regs have less murders than those with weak regs. And have lower suicide rates.

[Conn did major regs recently closing the gun show loophole and others and saw murder rate drop by 40%.. ](http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/12/us/gun-law-homicide-drop/)



Missouri  did the opposite.. [they got rid of background checks for guns... and saw a 25% increase in murders](http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2013/02/13/1589161/study-gun-homicides-increased-25-percent-after-missouri-background-check-laws-repeal/)

and to the bigots, no Conn did not ship its blacks to missouri.

and yes crime stats show blacks commit more crimes.. and while whites kill more whites than blacks kill whites, blacks lead the stats per capita.. and when you compare income levels. BLACKS STILL LEAD.. wow.. must mean blacks are predispositioned to violence huh? we got rid of ALL THE VARIABLES.. didnt we? well except racism and telling someone they are shit and less of a human for their entire lives might actually increase crime rates. When similar people are doing similar things but the cops all jump on the black guy.. well hes going to grow up thinking hes damned if he does and damned if he doesnt.. and this might cause the disparity in numbers. SO please dont link me that totally misused stats.

and if you still dont get it.. [watch the clark experiment. Sorry this kids are going to grow up thinking black people are inferior and thats going to cause an increase in crime.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkpUyB2xgTM) when you are taught at that young age that you are ugly, and bad... well try doing the same with a dog and see what type of dog you get when your done.



 




 dylann they let you post from jail? wow man. Times change.
 




 u from LA? what part? same to huicho.. 

edit: just a question, dude was attacking OP as if Op didnt know what he was talking about. LA is a big place. I have had my car towed there. I was just inquiring to see if their might be differences due to where they live.. Never heard of that reddit? 




 ahh the man with all the answers. We have been looking for you.
So how many and how often?

one  a day? one an hour? What will keep me from getting banned, and what is your position at the earnhoney empire?

Sorry dude, while you may be right, being snarky when you dont actually know for sure and have zero sources to share, isnt the brightest of ideas.

 




 it really goes hard against intuition. They really should train this more to people when they first get a DL. The first instinct is to hit the brakes, the second is to hit them harder.
 




 Its a little known fact that teh guy who invented scissors did so to get a pair of scissors out of the packaging. 




 well hopefully they will learn how stupidly offensive it is and how it was never the actual flag of the confederacy and only gained real popularity after the klan and other bigot groups started to use it and then was put up all over the south during the civil rights era.

its only true history, besides being on the dukes of hazards is bigotry. well that and it was the regiment flag of virgina and tenn.. the SC flag was the palmetto confederate flag which would have been more appropriate even though i still disagree with that one.

 really?

you know they are still in major use today right?

Go to your local hospital.. you will find pagers.

doctors are the main people who use them to this day.


(partially due to records laws they would rather them not use smart phones and such and since the page tech is there.. thats what they use)


[why do doctors still use pagers](http://rockhealth.com/2013/07/why-doctors-still-use-pagers/)

Case in point: physicians still carry pagers.  One recent estimate cites 90%+ of hospitals still use pagers.

..

Transmission of critical or emergency messages must be reliable, yet cellular and wifi networks can be disabled due to catastrophes, natural disasters or even technical problems (looking at you, Blackberry*).

they work on radio.. which is a bit more robust than cellular as far as natural disasters go.

and

Data breaches put patient information at risk. For example, 90% of US hospitals experienced a data breach in 2012 and 75% of hospitals are not sufficiently securing devices with patient data. Dealing with these HIPAA violations is very expensive.


and their batts last forever.

 the only solution

well there, you just stepped in it. Sorry anyone who says there is only one solution to just about anything is wrong.

one notice the article is about america and yet a lot of democracies dont have the same problem. INTERESTING.

so i guess we are a special species of human with such unique genes that we are predisposed to this nature where other people in other countries arent?

WE can culturally push back against the anti intellectual ravings of the right. How they spit out that being educated it elitist. Where they have a high school drop out edit the world of a doctorate to tone down the warnings on AGW.. and really we got to do something about the anti science folks who keep gettign americans killed by screaming "liberals only want lead out of gas to help catalyitic converter donors.. its not bad for you".. "liberals just want to control people, cigs arent addictive and tobacco doesn't cause cancer"... "there is no way cfcs could cause the ozone hole, tis a natural thing and man doesnt have that power".. "so2 isnt a problem and cap and trade of it will destroy all of society"(if you look when we did cap and trade so2, not only was it cheaper than the most optimistic view but more effective as well)

sorry man, but their is no ONLY Solution.. we can pull back from this VERY MODERN anti intellectualism from the right, without going to a scientific oligarchy. (they werent always like this, nor as fascist, just go back to nixons day.. its the birchers and the radically religious that took over the party since then.. that is the problem.. they need anti intellectualism because neither sides ideas are supported by science)
 




 Just say what it is.. the right wing is radicalizing.. mainly as a means of staying alive as some of their ideas fall out of favor.

its the same reason they went after the bigot vote in the first place. Progressives are populous, its why they dont have to play these games. Where the right has to win votes.

 one thing to keep in mind.

every single last one of these is going to have the crappiest CS on the planet.... for us. See we cost money. Yeah we make money.. but money goes from their hands to ours. They dont want to help you. The person running this doesnt know shit. Just the basics and a couple things he/she can read on the computer

on the other side, they are going to have theri best and brightest people. You want to give them money for an ad... send them an email, you might get a human calling you back, ready to answer all your questions. They will know absolutely everything about the service. CS will be stellar.

It doesnt mean they are going out of business when they seem totally retarded dealing with.. people they pay. Its quite standard. Because their most retarded employees are assigned to this side of cs.
 




 and not a single solitary republican vote.

REMIND ME WHY RAND PAUL IS A REPUBLICAN? but always runs on the liberal side of libertarian? legal drugs, no boots on the ground all over the planet, no spying against the TPP

and yet he lives with the party that is wholly anti legalization, will put boots on the ground at the slightest whim.. went against the dems and supported obama in both the patriot act and the TPP.

its almost like he only cares about right winger libertarianism or uber republicanism.... low taxes, and less regulations.


Just remember people the small gov conservatives, want you to go to jail for doing something recreationally to yourself that has never been shown to kill a single human.
 




 dude you can smoke up in your own home.. they can smell the shit from your front porch and cant get a warrant to come in now.

YEAH NOTHINGS CHANGED FOLKS.


the articles a bit click baity

but as long as you arent in public YOU CAN POSSESS IT.

and even if they can SMELL IT.. they cant break into your home now.

IT is also only a ticketable offense, if you smoke in public.
 




 well thats kinda the point.. if you decide "hey they loosening up lets go to the park where all the families are and smoke out at the picnic tables".. and have a big bag sitting on the table. He can come by and take it.


its also still illegal, so they can still use the same probable causes they have always used. I SMELT IT AND DIDNT DEALT IT.
 




 you can really tell the youngin.... er less experienced comments in this thread.

OMG the cops are going to steal weed now.

REALLY? WOW.. whats next they going to steal your money? 




 so you would rather go to jail when the cop finds your weed. HMMMMM

are you serious.

Before: cop smells weed, finds weed, busts everyone in the car. The guy busted will probably lose his job, if he is a visitor, he can stay in jail for months before trial because they dont know you well enough to let you out. And you can lose college scholarships and grants.

now: cop smells weed, finds weed, takes weed, yall continue on to your concert you were heading to.

you say it sucks worse now.

MMMMMMMMM ok
 




 sorta,... only.. ONLY because it can be confiscated.
you wont get a ticket.. which in most decriminalized  areas thats what it means it went from a criminal offense to a civil one.

 




 are you talking of perktv?

totaly hope this helps 




 sure it is a real thing, but dont think he was fueled at all by governmetn sponsored bigotry drapped in a lie called heritage?

come the fuck on they put it up in response to the civil rights movement.

it was a THINLY VEILED THREAT

much like when right wingers showed up with guns to heathcare debates wearing shirts about watering the tree of liberty when the healthcare debates included no measures to limit the second. IT WAS A THINLY VEILED THREAT. Its impossible to deny, when you know the history of the flag at our statehouse. It was put up for purely 1000% bigoted reasons and nothign to do with history. 

AND EVEN, if you buy the lie it has to do with history, it is the ENEMY FLAG TO THE US. It has no business flying. How would you like mexican flags flying in certain texas towns? Oh wait they do and right wingers flipped.. as they should. Its not mexico, its america, no matter what it used to be. WEll this isnt the confederacy, its south carolina of THESE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

 




 hes side stepping the issue because he wants the debate to be about something else. Both these guys damn well know why that flag is there.. why we didnt get mlk day until we got confederate day. They know it is the flag of the enemy and no other nation would let them fly it. And they know they put it up not due to heritage but due to hate. They know this, they just would rather talk about something else.
 




 the flag of our enemy.

do you think german towns shoudl still fly the nazi flag for heritage sake?

how about east germany still flying russian flags?

 




 here is the witchdoctor aisle... 


and whats bad, that would still probably be more effective than the homeopath aisle.
 




 yeah it will work but looks like you are using up all your sata ports. 
if you have an sata dvd/cd burner w/e then you will be short one.

wouldnt get those drives though.

you can get a twice as large, just as good(but faster due to size) ssd for about the same price.

and you can get a good 3tb hdd, for about the same price as that 2tb

 comcasts sells your data as well.

google in my book gets a slight bonus about comcast in that you can SEE all the data they collect on you... and delete. Something comcast doesnt offer yet.

the court misruled and bet the anon will win out.

in order for something to be defamatory, a court must fine that a REASONABLE PERSON would assume it is true.

this is the net.. if a reasonable person still ASSUMES a sourceless anonymous comment is true, there is a problem with that reasonable person.

 




   I honestly think this practice should be illegal, but I can understand it to a point.

nah you were right on the first half.

this is one of the many flaws with the "freemarket". Yeah you cant have 100 cable companies, phone companies laying cable.. so you need regulations that say the infrastructure and boxes and things have to be open to competition at a FAIR and reasonable rate.

Much like they already are required to do with over the air.
 




 and verizon telling customers they have zero plans to ever bring it to them...

nah sorry doesnt fly.

also they are blaming unions..

seems like verizon has a lot of excuses on why they cant do it.

 




 actually NYC does.

they are nearly their own country.
 




 by far most people who practice abstinence dont do so willingly.
 









 Yeah we get it, some white dude killed a bunch of black dudes, so we got to dilute that by bringing up stats and suspect interpretations of them.

Want a stronger correlation than race? sex. Men are EXPONENTIALLY more likely to be violent than women. WHy isnt that talked about as much as race. I mean if you want to pigeon hole the killers into neat little boxes for discussion by far the one, most fit in, is the MALE box.


problems with some interpretations and suggestions.

asians are more likely to have immigrated from far far way.. even if it was the parents or grandparents.. this suggests they had some economic or job opportunities. And looking at the h1b1, and how many come from asia versus africa, this seems true. SEEMS.

Where blacks are more likely descendants of slaves.

little different starting points in this race huh?

also as for race beating out poverty. So the author kinda suggests that race is the deciding factor. This is a bit low effort. There is differences in poverty and impoverished living. LIke the same poor black, versus poor white guy, the black guy is [MORE LIKELY TO GET SHOT WHILE UNARMED](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/01/black-americans-killed-by-police-analysis), in dealing with cops. Both criminals.. both interacting with cops with blacks more likely to get shot. Now you can say but they are also more likely to give trouble.. but since both those concepts feed on each other.. blacks getting shot might make them more afraid to get caught and more likely to fight getting caught.. etc

then while both can be poor their can be differences in opportunity to not be poor.

and there can be differences in how you are treated as a poor person.. which is definitely on display with the police.

just saying you cant dismiss poverty as the overriding factor just because the correlation isnt as strong, when you ignore other aspects of life that can actually raise that correlation. Meaning poverty combined with racial treatment might correlate even higher than simple race.


 nice graphs though.




 




 sorry thats just a bullshit stat cause every race is like that.. its promoted that way to try to dillute the very real issue.

Another stat you cant sweep under the rug so easily.. blacks 

[Black Americans are more than twice as likely to be unarmed when killed during encounters with police as white people](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/01/black-americans-killed-by-police-analysis)

hey but if we want to pigeon hole the MOST killers.. Race isnt best, sex is.. MOST KILLERS ARE MEN.

[we can also divide it up in different ways](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2012/12/14/nine-facts-about-guns-and-mass-shootings-in-the-united-states/)

the south is the most violent region in the US, most murders are southern.

Places with gun restrictions have less homicides than places that dont.


**Anyways while your stat is correct, it is misleading at the very least, when you fail to note it is the same for white people.**

and is mostly used by bigots to justify those in power and authority killing unarmed black people, because black people dont protest murderers as if that is the same.
(PS white people treat their perceived authority failures the same way as blacks and treat their criminals the same way as blacks.. they protest the former and just cry about the later) 




 hate the title..anyways

 But it also makes sense that the name would be Googled before it was tweeted; news organizations that had the name in-hand would want to do initial searches to validate the likelihood of his being the shooter before releasing the name publicly.

basically reporters getting the info from the cops immediately went to google. So before it was even reported.. google trends had his name trending.


kinda cool if you could harness this power and report things before they are actually reported.(ok i just broke my brain writing that sentence.) 









 Heritage? horseshit.. so was slavery.

If it was only heritage, the right wouldnt have held martin luther day hostage  until we make a confederate day.. what does a black mans birthday have to do with the heritage of the civil war? unless you just want to show your a bunch of bigots?

No other nation would let the losing aggressors, keep their battle flag flying in theri country, even incorporating it as part of their flag

I think right wingers could grasp if, if areas in germany adopted the nazi flag and complained it isnt bigotry, its heritage.

but some how they are completely oblivious to the hate the confederate flag brings(they arent oblivious at all, just like the southern strategy, they damn well know they are telling black people to fuck off)
 




 from /r/build a pc? thats odd.. not sure what i could have said here. 




 they are some sick fucks.

he extraordinarily referred it as a hate crime, because it was a white guy at a black church.

it is extraordinary as south carolina doesnt have hate crime laws.. cause we dont believe in them.. and please ignore the terrorists aspect of targeting a specific group.

But, Doocy continued, Bishop Jackson made a great point about the hostility towards Christians, suggesting that the attack had a religious instead of racial motivation.

well besides the comment about raping our women and taking over.. which proves it was about race... he wasnt wearing anti christian patches on his clothes.. he was wearing white supremecist crap.

The main reason they want to claim he is anti christian is they want to paint this as a problem with the left. When the right are riling up these insane people. WE have fox news day in and day out, telling the craziest and most unstable people in our country, that their insane beliefs are reality.

That obama is not a legit president.

that black people do want all your money and feel entitled to it.

and they are stealing elections through the lack of voter ID

and the only real racism today is anti white racism.


and so on and so on and so on.


it fuels the insane.

like one congressman put it.. it doesnt matter how you meant it, what matters is how the least stable person in my district takes it.

The right need to stop peddling fear and hate.

its what drives these people.
 




 I agree partially.

The pope is not saying YOU HAVE TO pass legislation.. and his report is directed at the people

the pope also isnt directly attacking any groups by name.

And thats what gets me, shouldnt the pope, wrong or right, be able to announce how he feels on global warming? legislation or not?

I have a feeling that bush would be agreeing with and maybe even touting anyone denying AGW. Does it matter if he is a pope(as far as opinion goes), or a grocery bagger.. hes allowed to have his opinion.

it strikes me as a bit hypocritical for them to say "i'm not a scientists but I dont believe in global warming and btw the pope isnt a scientists and he needs to shut the fuck up"
 




 and then they try to make religious based laws.

and bush is going to be asked every time about his comments to a catholic group about how he lead by his faith.. and actually passed legislation DUE TO HIS FAITH.


the right is in a conundrum, they NEED to attack the pope, and yet they also need to attack dems as secular and anti christian in order to rile up the evangelicals.(yeah they dont give a fuck about a pope but a lot of the republican base does)

what i really want to see the pope do is respond to the catholics attacking him and remind them of the churches teachings on the pope and maybe even threaten to excommunicate people like Bush its not UP TO BUSH to dictate what the church considers important.

(PS as far as economic policy.. bush might want to check out the stories of sodom, also when jesus threw the merchants out of the temples and the story about rendering unto caesar... NAH the church actually SINCE THE START OF CHRISTIANITY, has weighed in on economic matters and taxes)

 well considering pakistan has been sharing all its knows with everyone that can pay...

they also have allegedly built a nuke for the saudis, that is waiting on delivery. Which they did with the help of china.
 




 Well they are bullshit consumerism holidays.

Love my mom, and will honor the stupid holiday which comes days after her birthday where i honor her as well.. and I show my appreciation on xmas as well.


basically its nothing more than "buy shit day"

and soon enough we will have shoe giving day.. and give it 20 years and peopel will just think it was always tradition.
 




 so you can search out killings in other countries so that proves obama wrong. HUH.

This is the problem with republican science.

it snowed somewhere therefore global warming isnt real.


Looking at actual stats.. we have one of the [worst records for mass killings](http://www.statista.com/statistics/248845/number-of-victims-of-mass-shootings-in-western-democratic-countries/)

this isnt cherry picking a cold day and saying global warming isnt happening.

this is looking at stats.. and mass killings are more common in the US than other modern western nations.


SORRY DUDE. ITS TRUE.


 [15 of the 25 worst mass shootings in the last 50 years took place in the United States.](http://thefederalist.com/2015/06/18/actually-president-obama-mass-killings-arent-uncommon-in-other-countries/)

More than half.. and our country is 5% of the fucking planet. ASIA beats out the americas.. but individual countries, there is no competition, 
**WE ARE SO FUCKING ABOVE #2 THAT THEY CANT EVEN SEE US ANYMORE.**

It take only takes some rudimentary research to discover that rampage killers, acts of terror (as the Charleston shooting most certainly is), school attacks, spree killers are not unique to the United States.

and it only takes a very rudimentary search to show Obama was correct.


HEY DUDE.. how about stop with the knee jerk reactions to disagree with every word Obama says, cause yall just look dumb, when yall cherry pick data like that and call it science. IT ISNT.
 




 If you ask perk if your device is ok to use CS will probably say

"I'm sorry you are having problems with perk, Please try the following.

1. clear your cache.

2. reboot your phone.

3 try uninstalling the app and reinstalling."

Which of course doesnt answer your question.

Ok which phone does your android say it is?

Fairly sure that if they did answer your actual question the answer would be no.


 




 wot am i looking at?
 




 I'm more than against the crap we do around the world, but if any country on the planet needs regime change, there can be little argument on NK. Yeah i know nukes makes it untenable but damn that place is fucked up. 




 Riots generally happen to real or perceived miscarriages of justice and not to crimes no matter how heinous. And no matter the races involved.


not saying it couldnt and doesnt happen from these things, but in general, it tends to be when authority fails the community.(or is perceived to have)

prolly not the best people to copy for your business card
 




 hey everyone does that. Its the first thought of everyone who sees a poll and thinks of the population size... "NO WAY". You think of how diverse the country is and they only talk to 1060.. (most polls arround this many). I was the same way, until i took stats class and saw the math. The real key to it all.. is the random selection, it has to be as truly random as possible to make it work. because obviously if they only polled men in the south.. the numbers would be different.
 




 hes taking away a lot of teeth from them. But yeah i dont think there will be an inquisition. There could be some excommunications, depending on how badly some catholics treat the planet.

 




 This is the problem with republicans.

See its how all things liberal, every idea obama ever had, even when he adopts right winger ideas, is evil.

all because Obama said supported it.

I hated bush, but he did great things for aids in africa.. yeah he fucked up a bit with the abstinence crap.. but not all of it was abstinence and he literally helped reduce the aids rate. Now he is a republican, who does all he can to make sure our kids dont have access to condoms and birth control.. So how the fuck can I support him on his aids efforts in africa? BECAUSE I DONT FUCKING DISAGREE WITH EVERYTHING SOMEONE SAYS JUST CAUSE THEY ARE THE OPPOSITE IDEOLOGY. And almost no one do i agree with every word they say, even if they are the same ideology.

REPUBLICANS NEED TO LEARN THAT.

are their things I think are backwards as hell about this pope.. yep.

But he has made a fuck ton of progress in areas that I dont think are backwards as hell.

How to I justify supporting him in these areas?

**CAUSE I CAN FUCKING THINK FOR MYSELF.** 




 actually you are wrong.. but what ever.

He has done a shit ton.

I know yall wish he hasnt.

But he has.

he changed the way they move priests arround, pretty much shutting down the pedo underground railway..and set up a court system to punush them.. and oh yeah ACTUALLY ADMITED THE CHURCH IS FULL OF PEDOPHILES ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP.

but hey.. hes done nothing.. right? all talk .. right?
 




 he told the church to quit harping on birth control.
soooooo

fox news is also anti birthcontrol and regularly promotes the idea and cheered the hobby lobby ruling.. sooooo.

 




 WEll yeah, he cant change world policy, he isnt king of the planet.
But he can AND HAS changed church policy.
I wonder why so many of yall failed to notice.
SPECIFICALLY in these areas yall are attacking him in.
 




 and helped people justify their hate and oppression.
this one will actually get more people to change their tune.
it isnt the fact that they believe that most of us give a fuck about.
fuck all kinds of people believe all kinds of crazy shit.
I dont give a flying fuck my neighbor thinks ouji boards work.

But if my neighbor got political power and started to say all policy has to come from the ouji board, well then we have a problem.

the problem with the religious isnt their beliefs, it is that they want to impose those beliefs on us.
 




 and they are wrong.

He told the church to quit obsessing on contraceptives.

made all kinds of changes to prevent the moving of pedophile priests.

and set up a tribunal to punish them and those that protected them.

And yes you can mention someones good qualities and ideas while disagreeing with others. Like I like rand pauls anti spy shit.. I dont like pretty much the rest of rand paul. I think republicans have this idea that if you disagree with a single issue that someone takes, you have to disagree with every word. 

**Either way they were wrong about the pope in this case.. so while everyone else did it.. HE ISNT.**
 




 WEll he announced they had a pedophile problem which included the upper levels of the church. and [started a tribunal to punish them and the people who protected them](https://cognoscenti.wbur.org/2015/06/16/tribunal-pope-francis-rich-barlow)

and yess he is against contraceptives, but in his climate change report coming out, he said [catholics need to harp less on abortion, gay marriage and CONTRACEPTION.](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/20/world/europe/pope-bluntly-faults-churchs-focus-on-gays-and-abortion.html?pagewanted=all)

care to rethink your comment?

 




 their margin of error is at 0.5% with that sample size.. thats pretty close to reality.
 




 Sigh. No you are not wrong, but your comment suggests you dont understand statistics. it is counterintuitive but all you need is a sample size of 1067, for a margin of error of 3% with a 95% confidence level. Its not quite this but you can read this as your 95% sure you are within 3% of reality.

and total population size DOES NOT MATTER.. we can do the same in china... yes if something is rarer than 1 in 1000  you might not pick it up.. but as long as it is a sizeable percent you are. 

Really the science of stats is sound, and while it sounds counterintuitive, AS LONG AS THE SELECTION PROCESS IS RANDOM.. and the questions arent biased, you got yourself a good poll.


btw the margin of error for this poll would be about +/-0.5% so its right on the money so to speak. 




 The Trump campaign says it used the song legally  through a licensing deal with ASCAP, the musicians' copyright group. But as Rolling Stone notes, ASCAP's rules are different for using music in a political message; they require a campaign to reach out to the song's owners.

unfortunately, [he still violated rights.](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/06/17/415158962/neil-young-is-displeased-that-donald-trump-was-rockin-in-the-free-world)  see muscians tend to be kinda sensitive about this, so .. its in the contract. 




 whats funny is this song was actually written as a protest of republicanism, specifically a protest of h.w bush.
 




 whats bad is his base is so absolutist these days, that he actually has to say things like that after doing the right thing. 




 i wonder if att could package its grandfathered unlimited users into a sub company and then let that company go under. not advocating, just wondering what shenanigans they can get into 




 yup.

half on 2.40

half on 2.4.1

2.4 doesnt seem to crash as much but thats just a few data points and not enough to say that.

if you 2.30 guys are crashing.. i'm thinking it is perk and not the app 




 um they already have drones.

they have already showed it working.

and they are lobbying to change the laws and working with nasa to update the air traffic control system.

sorry man... you dont go through this trouble at the alpha stage.

**these things will be in flight this year if amazon has its way.**

mind you... like the google cars.. it will be in one single city to start... and then it will spread.. but this isnt bar nap ideas, this is something pretty much finished, now we need a real world city tests.

 




 you can get a similar effect from looking at objects through an index card with only a small opening allowing light through

I have done that to find my glasses that got knocked off bed side table by my cat using your index finger.. wrap it up like it would be in a fist and look through the little hole.(keep other fingers flat.. like an ok sign but shrink the o as small as it will go)

its very cool, how i can read things,  that are impossible to see without my glasses, even with some mega squints going on. 




 they sure are spending a fuck ton on this PR stunt, it would almost be better to just get an ad. They are fighting regulations and lobbying congress and working with nasa to set up a better air traffic control that could handle drones. For a practical joke, they are going the extra mile.

also you may be right, this might never work very well.. its not like tons of money have been put behind things that havent before.. segway. Either way it looks like they are serious.

and they dont have to all be 5 miles from a hub, they could rent spaces on towers and buildings for quick charge and battery swaps.. drop off the dead in the charger, pick up the new and continue 




 well i question if that happened or was an excuse.

and what they recorked it?

I think the story will change a little when we find out more/. 




 thats one of the funniest parts I think. Ostensibly, the dad is trying to entertain the kid, but the look on the kids face suggests that he has been through/survived this before and is not amused. 




 the problem is people dont understand the scale is exponential.
 
























 prolly more for world politics than world news. its only loosely based on an event.. the explosion, and more based on politics.

 i bet you can find similar quotes from similar people at the same time slavery was ended. 




 every notice the difference between the staff at costco versus walmart? why do you think that is? think they like cherry pick the best of the lower levels of employment? or could it be that you get a better service because the employees care more because they can feed their family on the wages paid without having to get food stamps as well?

how does it go with you guys.... "you get what you paid for" and sir you just paid for some cheap ass service.
 




 well really, most people's complaints with CS, is when they try to leave.

well besides "Yeah, there is an outage in your area, we are working to fix it as soon as possible"

thats about it for cs.
 




 there used to be this store near me, called blockbuster... they had similar views.

its really kinda crazy, they had all the power and resources to kick ass, except the power to change.

 dint [know this info, thanks](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/05/white-house-sides-with-oracle-tells-supreme-court-apis-are-copyrightable/) 




 Do consenting adults have a right to contract with other consenting adults? Supporters of the Supreme Courts decision argue yes but they argue no when it comes to economic liberties, like contracts regarding wages.

nope, even marriage has rules. Like multiple.. and divorces and ages and so on. I cant marry a child, like you cant hire one to work the mines, rand. Both have regs, yes marriage just lost one.. no gays. it still has a ton. Example fail.

I acknowledge the right to contract in all economic and personal spheres, but that doesnt mean there isnt a danger that a government that involves itself in every nook and cranny of our lives wont now enforce definitions that conflict with sincerely felt religious convictions of others.?

and when it effects others THEY SHOULD.

why does the right get this when it comes to muslims? and banning sharia law all over the south, like that was a pressing problem?

Some have argued that the Supreme Courts ruling will now involve the police power of the state in churches, church schools, church hospitals.

yeah cause teh rulling ordered preists to do gay marriages.

No one is saying shit to them, or shit to religious schools. HOSPITALS? YEAH FUCK OFF DUDE.. thats different. AND THE GOVERNMETN SHOULD TELL THE RELIGIOUS TO FUCK OFF.. its in the public sphere.. their schools and churches are not.

more fail from rand.

he also ignores his love of contracts doesnt work if they get invalidated at state lines.

but what ever.. keep digging rand, you never had a chance anyways, and you choose to step in a pile of shit, as you make dumb ass excuses about the free market thats just going to remind people your stepping into civil rights shit, when you claimed that the free market would have cured being bigots to blacks, without forcing businesses to actually serve them.. please ignore poverty makes it hard to "vote with your feet"

rand you just convinced me you are a bigger dumb ass than i ever gave you credit for and the only reasons you are speaking is you want to help protect the bigots. Considering the white supremecist support you and your father enjoyed, it might be just best if you shut teh fuck up and stick to tax cuts and deregulation, cause thats the only shit you really care about.
 




 ever have a divorce? 




 So walmart was set up.

Big fucking deal

and its the same BULLSHIT they did the last time with the anti gay cake.

The problem isnt the religious refusing to write gay and lesbian crap on cakes.. the problem was they refused to sell a cake at all. But the text on it.. that is  covered by freedom of speech and you cant make a cake maker write words they find offensive. BUT THEY HAVE TO MAKE THE CAKE.

so yeah a gay black man baker, has to make cakes for the klan/gop/w/e but they dont have to write the words on the cake.

this is more right winger retardation, just a rerun of the anti gay cake... they are allowed to do an isis cake and not a confedderate one, but both people have to get a cake.
 




 well part of the answer is there is no one republican party. its actually a coalition of conservative groups. There is the more economic conservatives and libertarian conservatives, who tend to yell the most to keep out of peoples lives. They are joined with the authoritarian and war like conservatives... How are more into spying and keeping the country safe and dont think people have the right to privacy and tend to like a lot of laws that put people in jail and are also joined with social conservatives, who do want government interference in social issues, like abortion and gay marriage and yoga pants and drugs and ...

there is no one republican party, so you are hearing the small gov chants of one section of the party, and the calls for  abortion laws from another section.

dems have similar coalitions, there is no one real dem party

they have to do this, rather than become multiple liberal and multiple conservative parties due to first past the post voting.
 




 this is my biggest problem with it. More than all the other crap people freak over.

it isnt national security.

Its a massive trade agreement.

Treaties are the highest law of the land akin to amendments.

the people have the right to know what our government is doing.

we are a republic, sure, cause the people can be idiots but mainly to protect minority rigths.. but also cause people would vote for services and vote against the taxes to pay for them and shit,. BUT  we have the right to be informed, and the right to lobby our reps on how they should vote and that if they dont vote our way, there could be consequences. It doesnt matter if we are actually in the wrong. 

and if we cna see some of the more crazy healthcare and budget ideas.. why the fuck cant we see this? that scares me more too.

like rand paul proposes flat tax.. thats insane, would explode the deficit, we would need massive cuts and would shift the burden to the lower classes...and now I know about it, i can tell my rep hell fucking no. or for the right, the proposals to legalize those brought here as children.. who have not commited any crime since.. yall have the rigth to say "hey vote fuckign no"

but with the tpp, they arent telling us shit.

1. news of the stupid doesnt require it be current.

2. it is becoming election season and as such this info is relevant to today.

 probably just protesting the entire week. 




 what gets me, these people would like a dont_burn_the_us_flag in protest amendment, but then fly the flag of  the enemy of the union in protest every time they get.

 his investments in carbon also dont have an effect on its use. Demand and government regulation does. and the "you could do more" game is always a loser.

but everyone on the planet could sell every oil related stock they have and it wouldnt effect our use of gas. Investing in the energy sector isnt the same as venture capital into a new project. Losing investments would never kill big oil, they already make a little of their own money. 




 true.

But i do rank people like that in my mind.

People who believed in it before the ruling people who accept it after the ruling the people still fighting and crying about it.

pandering is better than digging in your heals. i'm a dem but i will say this comment is better than some of the others i have heard from the right on this issue.
 




 yep, heard it for years and thats about as much as you get. "he seems like it". But i would add, its more than not been married, he hasnt been known to really date either. i'm not trying to tilt the favor towards "he's gay".. but obviously if he had a different lady on his shoulder every week the "not married" wouldnt suggest gay in some peoples minds.

I couldnt care much less if he is or isnt. If he is and wants to come out, i hope he can some day. but i dont really consider him being fancy or single, means hes gay.. 




 What Googles doing, in these cases, is using its deep pockets in the interest of broader social ends, with seemingly little concern for short-term returns.

maybe short term, but lets not forget what google is, its an advertising and media company. Having a better infrastructure for silly cat videos is good for google. more and more people substitute youtube for tv. They might have good social intentions as well, but this sentence makes it sound like they are being selfless, and thats not true. 




 I think you mean as far as the line speed goes. FIOS and all and your mostly correct about that. but patent issues do always slow everything down a little.. but wasnt a huge deal with fios. but even if your idea is unique you got to do patent searches. But its been minor in bandwidth, and bringing high speeds to the people.

but the rest.. nah patents have been a big thorn in technology. There was a massive battle to build up patent portfolios when all the lawsuits started to happen. the big fears for small time developers is that they dont have the same access to a massive patent nuke of their own to protect them from lawsuits. Its definitely an issue. Slightly less today as some patent trolls were shut down by some various rulings, but yeah they were fucking up shit for a while

and then their are other countries fucking shit up.. like the iphone5 was patented by a clone maker in china before apple patented it...costing them a ton of money they might rather spend on research.


 




 well thats why governments tend to be the pioneers into the high risk unknowns and commercial interests come in afterwards and bring it to the people.  Gov explores, maps the wilds, puts up roads and commercial interests build the homes and businesses around it.

same with net, and space. unfortunately with net, they decided to stop branching out.. and luckily google though help with the government, stepped into some markets to inject competition.(sigh living near a google city, just an hour drive north they get 5 times my speed for the same price i pay)
 




 yeah its a bit odd given the context. She might have bigger identity fears though.. however the problem isnt women covering up, its the lack of choice. If she wants to wear her face thing, thats a triumph of freedom as long as she can take it off if she wants as well.
 




 not that hard actually but reddit might complain.

there are 'reddit clones" and i mean of the data.. sorta. I believe they just use the reddit api.. i used to have a rainlender desktop where i pulled in all the posts from my fav subreddits to be my desktop backgound. they were clickable and all that. could either go to the link or the comments.

but the point is, they could pull in through the feed the reddit posts.. though reddit probably would have a legit complaint over that, especially using their own software to do it. but voat could pull in just the posts and leave separate an area for us to comment.

and here are a couple reddit feed pages. and yeah i know not the same as cloning reddit. but the point is there are ideas they could possibly work on though legality might be issues.

[redditjs](https://redditjs.com/) (this one just kinda mods the interface, click grid and crap on top.. its cool)

and [aggreddit](http://aggreddit.com/?r=reddit.com+pics+politics+WTF+funny+programming+science+technology) (this one you set up the reddits with the link. like this one http://aggreddit.com/?r=reddit.com+pics+politics+WTF+funny+programming+science+technology)

and [redddit in real time](http://erqqvg.com/)

there are a few others.
 




 a small suggestion, since you seem passionately involved. I am going to assume for not, that you have a better idea of the contents of the TPP than say the generally public, since its been mostly kept a secret. And yeah there have been leaks and such. But you might want to pretend that people dont know anything at about it, each and every time you complain about being deleted or banned.

Like 

I hope they're not in college yet, because the TPP will cripple students.

wow sounds scary.. how is a trade agreement going to do that? honest. I dont know. I heard some on the copyright and some on the laws, i question, but most people i know dont know a damn thing.

These days, i hear more about the battle between yall and /r/polices and /r/news than i do the actual contents of the agreement. And thats not really good for your movement.

and yeah i know those are the places you would like to educate people and so part of that is hampering you on getting out your message... which is why you should be detailed in your complaints about deletes. Some of us dont know enough about it.

right now i am against it from what i heard, but yall go off on a lot of stuff, thats just not common knowledge yet and yall should work at making it so.

for me my biggest problem with the thing is being kept in the dark, this isnt war, this isnt national security, this is a trade agreement we have the right to know and lobby our reps to do what we think is right, even if it isnt. Even if our country loses power.. if we decide as a country we dont want to go in that direction, we shouldnt.(and unfortunately, i actually accept that on ideas that i would like to see passed.. its the american way, good or bad) 




 not only that, its a horse shit claim.

I can easily show how after connecticut closed the gun show loophole and put some restrictions on guns, saw a drop in murders by 40% over a ten year period. Now some of that is with the decline in murders us wide, but theirs was a bigger drop.

i can also show were missouri recently to show how anti left they were, got rid of some background checks and saw a 23% increase in murders.

most liberals.. just want to see the gun show loopholes which makes it totally easy for criminals to by pass background checks and get guns to get closed to make the law we put on the books back when reagan was shot, to actuallty be effective. Increasing background checks it not "letting only the criminals get guns". If you arent a criminal you can pass a  background check.

(and before someone says anything private sale loophole what ever you want to call it, but dont insult anyones intelligence by saying it dont exist.)

only a tiny minority of liberals want to go the english route of no guns.

What he is doing is as wrong as claiming all republicans think womens bodies shut down in rape so any women who get pregnant while being raped must have wanted it.

obviously only a small subset of extremist republicans feel that way.

well its the same but on the left with "gonna ban all guns"

 




 Its not really deceptive as long as you know they are measuring it by the country.

it is odd since the title of the link, is a bit deceptive to the 'left" of agw science... while the graphics sorta can appear deceptive towards the right. since it looks like "hey agw is no big deal here and fuck africa".. I get that. But its more about resolution. Posted without the text explaining that, then yeah.. its very deceptive, but otherwise its a difference of resolution.

I have to assume due to the title choosen for the article, that they were not trying to be deceptively denialist. Otherwise it would be "agw is not as big of a deal as you think.. look what countries will do ok"


and probably the most important line from the entire article.

 In other words, the best-ranked countries are only as great as they seem compared against the countries that arent performing so well.

its going to fuck us bad.. in costs.. for sure.. evacuate miami? lol easier to type but we are a wealthy nation and will do better, as far as direct climate effects than others. There is other worries about how the world will react  as climate change gets worse and we might have more to worry about from the war/terrorism front... then some countries
 




 /r/tronscript  might be some help 




 I think aol spent more on advertising than anything else. you could hardly get out of your driveway due to all the discarded discs.
 




 op here.. thanks.. post removed. 




 eh at least its posted here and not somewhere serious.

interesting read and some of it is probably true. but on issues like this, its a huge warning sign for you to use the views of a single person from that group.... and one that has been transplanted out of the area for a good bit of theri lives.


not saying they are wrong, but there has been a few black people who think taking down the confederate flag was wrong and harmed black people, by being petty over heritage and reinforcing the angry black man... not my thoughts in the least, but you can easily see and article "black man says keep the flag up, black people dont care'

and well you are missing the story.

OK back to the claim


Reading the click throughs are better at understanding this claim, then the article link, and i can see the concept as possible. However

if i say jews control all the money.. like some bigots like to do.. its still anti semetic, even if i wouldnt mind if it was me to control all teh money. So just cause i aspire to become that which i condemn, doesnt make it not bigotry always.

and last.. you do know its kinda bigoted to say all south koreas wishes they were money grubbing and careless about others? Even if you find one that pines to be attacked on those ideas. and you cant debunk a scientific conclusion with "i feel this is so" the scientific conclusion which COULD BE WRONG. that sk is bigoted because of the view they have.. to debunk this you got to show that SKn also hold the views that eventually they want to have these traits as well.. which means another study and not.. i met this dude who was like this and so all south koreans are like this.





 




 it is, but in america it is nearly impossible to have any civilized debate on the prison issue because one side refuses to and justifies everything by "that dude was evil".. doesnt matter if there is a better more effective way.. doesnt matter what science says.

shit look at all the people pissed the fuck off about how much it costs to keep someone in jail for life, 

A. ignoring it costs more to kill them.

and big for me.

B. these same people dont trust the government to do a god damn thing right, but when it kills its own people they are holy perfect.

so good luck talking about the conditions of solitary or how other countries do it.. or how our crime isnt worse than say frances, and yet per capita we put about 10 times as many people in jail.

we have a problem in this society and just trying to do smart things with the laws will get you labeled as a murder defender, or callous or w.e.. fuck even defence attorneys get attacked just for doing their job.
 




  On the other hand he has every incentive to sell prison employees out just to be a dick.

nope the exact opposite dude.

he has every incentive on the planet to not say shit.

how are you going to get more help to escape in the future.. if you rat out the guards?

nah.. he wouldnt say shit.


 




 well now I am confused.

You can keep wifi on the router for people with wifi.. and just disable it on the computer.

family can still use it.

unless you are trying to use your computer as a router? and want people to connect to your computer via wifi and go through your computer and out its ethernet? that can be done, but easier to just disable wifi on the computer and leave wifi on the router for family.


When I turn it off, the computer uses ethernet, but when it's on, wifi is used.

at least we know it isnt hardware.
 




 holycrap.. and this is the dailymail?

Just how the title.. not surprised they reported it but normally the title wouldnt have been so ..non attacking.

 




 running an iphone5 24/7 for an entire year is 41 cents. less than 4 cents a month. If your phone is crappier than an iphone5.. this number will most likely be lower.

ipads are less than $2 for 24/7 .. full year.


now laptops and tablets can get a bit more, seeing about $8 a year.. depending on models.

netbooks are going to tend to use less.

[for most of us, elect shouldnt even be a thought.](http://blog.opower.com/2012/09/how-much-does-it-cost-to-charge-an-iphone-5-a-thought-provokingly-modest-0-41year/)

i mean if your making less than 8 dollars a year in beer money.. 9in order for a laptop to be profitable) you might try something else.


 




 you really have all the info you need at hand, you are just asking for someone to tell you what to do. Its up to you man.

basically your going to hear two things.. i hacked and made a more money and didnt get caught.. versus i hacked and got banned, losing all ability to earn this easy beer money.

its classic risk reward... with unfortunately a random unknown.. you getting caught.

so is it worth it to you, the extra money you get per month 'hacking'. knowing you can get ip banned and lose the ability to work with perk, to keep doing it.

basically and this is a bit over the top.. but its the same idea, basically you are saying "i rob stores for extra money, i read in the paper that people get busted for this shit.. should i still rob stores" ok punishments are worse and rewards are greater... but its the same idea.
 




 like all others.

you get a link.

give link to friend.

friend clicks on link

friend signs up for perk

when friend redeems first reward..(read.. ACTUALLY uses the service.. they have to do this because its easy to automate sign ups.. and they want real people with real phones, actually perking)

you get your points.
 




 well you remember them pranksters? that tend to go to massive global business forums?

who made the proposal of letting the poor eat shit.. basically they claimed to have come up with a method of extracting nutrients from shit and turning it into hamburgers we could sell to the worlds poor.

the [yes men](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZP_nNemsNT8) 




 so by priority you mean the metrics?

hmm.. if you did metrics should have worked.

You can always disable the wifi adaptor in device manger or in the  change adaptor settings(probably best here)

if that kills your net.. and a reboot dont clear it up.. you probably have a problem with the ethernet.. since you bought a new router, i would check the cables first.
 




 why? its a good question? it helps further show how their true ideology is hate and bigotry and has shit to do with religion.  No i am sure they THINK they are religious, but basically they warped religion into a perfectly fitting body wrap around themselves. Thats not religion, thats clinically insane narcissism. They are basically saying they are the perfect example of what god wants to see in a human being, even if the bible says shit about the crap they do. because that doesnt count, the only things in the bible that count are shit other people do that he doesnt like.


it doesnt matter all the rest, any of it. lying stealing, killing, working on sundays, multiple marriages.. none of it for themselves, but for other people...

they are cherry picking bigots who want to shove theri own personal version of their religion down our throats while ignoring all the crap theri bible says about shit they do that they ignore. and the biggest is probably bearing false witness.

And last tell me this, if they are so fucking pious, so fucking religious the get pissed when someone doesnt say marry christmas. So fucking religious we got to tip toe arround offended them like they have some crazy person....why the fuck dont they threaten to set themselves on fire because the state lets people work on sundays in non emergency jobs? that shit was written in stone, i would think their god would think it was important.

nah they are bigots and liars.. and trump is helping people see that. 




 I get what you are saying the 10th.. right? The problem with that idea, is that constitution, is the constitution has a lot of other crap in it. Like how to AMEND the constitution and who gets finally say on what is constitution.(which you can override with an amendment)

Now.. this amendment process, honors the people like you who since the beginning of this country have screamed states rights. ITs actually honors the 10th amendment. Why? because amendments have to be ratified by 3/4ths of the states  level legislators AS well as pass the federal senate and house..

So the states, Under the protection of the 10th amendment agreed to the equal protection clause in the 14th amendment. This is where the fed doesnt get any powers not delegated to it. WEll the states gave the fed the power over "equal protection". The supreme court who decides what they meant, says its their jurisdiction and its their power to actually decide if its their jurisdiction via the constitution.

your tenth amendment rights were protected under both rulings. You have the right to over rule EITHER.. EITHER.. we can make black people slaves again.. NO SHIT.(well besides black people might not like that idea much) but it would take an amendment to the constitution. and 3/4th of the states to give the power back to the states. Now it is actually possible for scotus to find a new amendment unconstitutional but that is an untested legal theory as to what would actually happen in that case.


but yeah, just make an amendment saying states have the sole power to define marriage, and get 3/4s of the countries statehouse to agree.

 




 well they werent wholly wrong, he did say some very questionable things at the start, that made it seem like he was going to rule very much in the telecoms favor. 

I was only pointing out the flip.
 




 Sorry the title misrepresents the study a bit too much.

1/3 of the largest reservoirs are being used faster than they can recover. they are over stressed.

that is not the same as 1/3 being depleted as in gone.
 




 maybe.. especially in states that already legalized. the i got mine, dont give a shit about you and probably cry states rights.. yeah my state did it.. move here if you dont like yours.

and ... well there are probably some gays that like the excuse that its illegal in that it keeps their relationship open. Ok thats a bit petty but there are heteros that dont want to get married but are under constant pressure to do so.. see canadian storage wars.  WEll i bet she(the girl who keeps saying no on csw) might like the easier excuse,"i would marry you but its illegal" Its a bit more than petty to say its a bad decision because you have cold feet.. but its plausible. Some republican gay who has been using it as an excuse to his partner for ages, now has none. 




 he votes how alito votes. 




 1 of them joined the left. so  one is kinda mainstream.
it was 5  to 4 with all the left joining kennedy.
 




 i wasnt talking religion, just people who kill themselves to protest something. [And that most are a form of protest against a powerful oppressive government](http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/a-terrible-act-of-reason-when-did-self-immolation-become-the-paramount-form-of-protest)

and while more prevalent in the east, the west, has seen a ton as well. but christians did it in rome, and russia, and various christians have done it but not for christian causes and at least one to protest war in the us.
 




 and thats good.. fast track isnt inherently  bad.. some of the rules they added to it is bad. Fast track is the way it actually has always been. 

You should not be able to amend the treaty and send it back.

you should be able to make recommendations and demands that the president secure, before negotiations. But you give treaties up or down votes. Thats because there are too many legislators involved in too many countries. WE would never have gotten any multi country treaty passed without fast track.

it simply says no amendments and the treaty gets a vote on the floor.

the secrecy and contents suck balls, but fast tracks the way its got to be.. in all big treaties.. maybe between two . or three countries.. but even then we are talking 2000 reps each with political goals and agendas.. much bigger than that, its wholly impossible.


edit; ok we can debate a bit on the "this treaty gets a vote" because it removes the ability to filibuster, which to me isnt as bad as adding amendments and can be killed with enough votes. But the rest of fast track is a good thing. (and yeah filibusters have been more than abused just to pass minor things, but something like this, i say filibuster is fair game)

 




 remember when reddit wanted to tar and feather wheeler? pepperidge farm remembers.
 




 actually this is typical.

the haters who scream they will do this never do.. its the ones who have a powerful feeling of sacrifice for others, in the face of some oppressing force... like tibet, china

haters tend not to. And you can kinda see why, their lives tend to be governed by fear.
 




 "true conservative"?

sorry but i disagree, you can have conservative religious. and you can have conservative authoritarians.

your brand of true conservative, which sounds pretty libertarian preaches less government intrusion.

unfortunately your brand of conservatism, is only a small part of the republican party which represents you.

Not attacking, same with progressives, we can have authoritarian progressives, and religious progressives, and non religious progressives. states rights progressives. but unfortunately for us, while we tend to have more social conservative progressives, we dont have as many economic and legislative progressives as many of us would like.

i am surprised there isnt more infighting in the gop because their coalition has so many opposite views.

but basically the gop is economic conservatives, mixed with authoritarian and religious conservatives.

 




 allah is the arabic word for god. Or "THE GOD OF ABRAHAM".. yeah that abraham.. same dude.

they are both abrahamic religions. Allah = yahweh = god

Same god, different language. Period.

Now muslisms came after christians and much like mormons today, they tend to not see them as following the same faith. but islam is just judaism and the torah + christianity and the bible + the quran and muhammad.

much like mormons are judaism + christianity, + the book of mormon and joe smith.

they are just additions to the existing religion. Same god, all 3.

now as a matter of faith, you can claim its a bastardization of the abrahamic religion.. but like it or not, they claim to worship the exact same dude.




 




 all religions are.

and sorry if you think the muslims are the only ones acting bat shit crazying and killing non believers you havetn been to christian africa, it just doesnt make the news as much for us, because it isnt very strategic.

the muslims were actually very enlightened when the christians pushed us in the dark ages. They lead the word for intellectual advancement and protected a lot of knowledge from destruction. They had a resurgence of right wing, lets go back to the past, science is afront to god, type folks, that put islam into its own sort of dark ages, part of that was helped by the west when we went down to the middle east and fucked the place all up which helped the more militant right winger muslims to rise a few dozen times in history, but part of it was islam itself. But it is no different that christianity as far as "outdatedness".. and there are many muslim nations that are quite progressive, especially in asia. you are just looking at the right winger version when you see the violence and offense and religious control over every day life.. much like our right would like to do in the us.
 




 2 people attacked by shark off the coast of SC.

right? left? inbetween?

There can be non political news, but I do agree that most is.
 




 nope.. it suggests that it does IN FACT reduce how much insurance companies have to pay out for claims.

its not the same as what you are suggesting which they do do for other things... let me put it this way.

jenny the drinker slips on wet floor, hurts back, sues for workmans comp, passes drug test gets 50k

tommy stoner, slips at the exact same time, on the exact same floor, but get drug tested. The insurance companies will claim it was the drugs that influenced his fall so they dont have to pay him 50k

it has nothing to do with drug tests working.

it has to do with using drug tests to get out of paying.

if you want to say they work at saving insurance companies and the businesses that hirer them, money, then yeah.. they work for that, but they are sold for productivity reasons.
 




 well thats generally what happens when you make less work injury claims.
 




 well I will if he only uses blogs and youtubes to make his case.

I don't share your faith in government and large institutions.

big business kinda disagrees, its government who are the pioneers, after they access the situation, the commercial markets move in. See commercial markets dont like entering areas where the risk is highly unpredictable, the government is less hampered and as such, thats why they were the first in near earth orbit, but now its time for the commercial enterprises to take advantage of the info the government provided so they can successfully fulfill market needs. (and yeah i saw the neil degrasse talk) 




  We don't have a realistic method to produce that much bacteria

i think the point is it would feed and breed on mars.. bacteria dont really need us to produce a ton, it would just take a lot longer for the colonies to grow.

but i suspect we would send relatively little.. and yeah maybe someone can debunk this idea and say "yeah but it would tkae 2 million years to reach critical levels" idk.. but i know that shit breeds fast.
 




 NZ finds Black Cocks hard to swallow

lol media.

Not quite the same but in south carolina with the gamecocks.. everything is cocks. girls all wear pants with cocks on the butt.

our horse cocks won the equestrian national championships.

our lady cocks kicked ass in basketball.

heck even our disc cocks  kicked some butt this year tossin the frisbees.

three wet cocks are going to the national diving competition.

running cocks, sandy cocks.. and so on... we are a bit childish but idc.

edit: my bad the volleyball team is the sandy cocks.. fixed 




 interesting, i had always heard prescott bush was part of that.
came from the bbc. Now i dont see any credible links.. just ones on sites like prison planet.. its still claimed in a single bbc radio program and can find it no where else.. cant even seem to find their sources.

anyone have any credible info, before i file this under my 'unproven conspiracy, dont use' box in my mind? 




 nope. We do get you have a hate for the man, so your view is horribly colored.

Let me hazard an easy guess, but i suspect you dont happen to be an obama supporter? that you probably agree more with the right of the aisle? is this a fair assessment? not saying you are a republican, just not left? and let me guess fdr mae the depression worse?
 




 it wouldnt matter if it was when he sucked hitlers dick.

the comment is about a president giving an eloquent fuck you to his detractors. the guy posting it doesnt even say he is a supporter. 

it doesnt have to do with politics as much as kick ass fuck you'n

and yeah a lot of the left was fucked up and bigoted as fuck before the civil rights era.. tell me do we have to discount all of history and say absolutely and none of it was good until say after the  race riots of the 60s? fuck back then republicans were the anti bigots.. now the head of the republican party in the house(not the speaker but the lead of the party) was a speaker at a white supremacist group which he claims was a different meeting held at the same time and place with the same people but on different subjects.

anyways lets get back to beautiful fuck yous.

like i said the GOP used to be the anti bigots.. maybe you can find a famous GOPr like lincoln or something telling the bigots off eloquently. I'll upvote that shit. Or fuck, idk, it could be bush jr, who i hate, if you find a good speech, and i agree it was a good fuck you.. Up votes are heading your way 




 and they never stopped hating him 




 more [info for those who want to know what he is talking about](http://www.politico.com/story/2014/04/joe-biden-gay-marriage-white-house-response-105744.html)

Vice President Joe Biden really did get ahead of President Barack Obama on accepting gay marriage in 2012  and the White House really wasnt happy about it, despite the two leaders many attempts to claim otherwise.
..

Thats the story laid out in Jo Beckers new book, Forcing the Spring, which documents the past few years of successful efforts to expand the legalization of gay marriage, according to an advance copy obtained by POLITICO.

biden might still get some credit historically. Obama def will get the most as he was president, but the gay community will probably learn of and know of bidens contributions in future studies.

 




 yeah, in my area it bugs me a bit, due to recession we cut back.. no more mosquito spraying.. but we sure as fuck put up christmas decorations every year.. and yeah we own them and probably dont have to replace too much but it takes a fuck ton of workers to put that shit up all over town and take down.
 




 i'm sure teh gov has some gels for various reasons, including entertainment. you will find them on military bases in the clubs and such. he might have gotten his own, but its not like the gov doesnt have them. 




 some  dude in bathrobe with a beard loves trucks... its hilarious how much reverence they give to an impossible image. Even if you think his skin wasnt that dark, his facial  features  as displayed are decidedly from north of those parts from which he was said to reside.
 




 It also doesnt matter that much.

there are rich people that lobby for higher taxes and yet still pay the rate it is today.

you can complain about the communication laws, trying to oppen the system up more, while being part of it.. like tmobile did some with tower sharing


you can claim walmart is killing the place without doubling your employees pay and trying to compete with your much smaller buying power.

its not necessarily hypocritical.. and yeah it is a bit different if it is a advocacy group but like people mentioned, it goes up to 15 quickly.

and you can be a smoker and advocate stricker laws, the big hypocrisy happens when you dont let people know you are a smoker as well and instead get caught
 




 is ti wrong? or cruel? I mean if you get the woman to stop destroying the thing further.. is that a bad thing? in court they are going to list the cost of repair. I dont think she would have listened if he said.. hey stop doing that. but she might listen if he said something stupid.
 




 yeah i dont doubt the idea between federal power and states rights has been a long fought over idea. But really with anyone saying that, point them to the confederate constitution. It gives itself supremecy over the confederate states. STRONG FED... that lost only the power to ban slavery.

They actually edited the lines above and below the supremacy clause in the us constitution but left the actual supremacy clause in theirs.

how can it be about states rights, when their own constitution set up the exact same fed as the US constitution, sans the right to ban slavery.

and here is the thing..  [banning slavery didnt start the war. Banning expanding slavery into the new territories into the west did.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War) No one told the south they couldnt have slaves.. but that the slave trade couldnt expand out west. 

even when lincoln did his [emancipation proclamation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emancipation_Proclamation) which was after the war had started. ALL it actually did ws change the federal legal status of slaves. SO that if a slave escaped a slave holder state, he would not be forced by the courts to be returned as property. and due to quirks in presidential rights during war time... he could only apply the proclamation to states in active rebellion.. so only a few were actually freed by lincolns actions.. the rest were freed near the end of the war with an actual amendment process which you cant compain federal power, since it requires 3/4ths of the state houses to agree

 it did not apply to those in the four slave states that were not in rebellion (Kentucky, Maryland, Delaware, and Missouri
 




 You know, I could respect her praise if she admitted she made a mistake and has grown on the subject like many other American.

so you dont think she is doing better than the GOP in the fact that she isnt trying to make an amendment overturning the ruling.

No where did i claim she meant it.. just that she accepts it.

You can at least grasp that right? The GOP are continuing the war, she put down the pitchfork. She can still believe what she believes, but sorry I WILL SAY IT IS A GOOD THING, when someone puts down teh pitch fork.. even for bullshit.. non real reasons. The fact is she is no longer dressed in the enemies uniform shooting at us. Why she isnt I dont give a fuck.. the fact she isnt is good.

But i do appreciate your response. Unlike the rest.

I am no fucking hilary fan.. i wonder about the clinton bush reagan connections especially when it comes to the CIA and drugs.. You do know the cia planes that did the iran contra drug smuggling used arkansas airports while bill was gov..


**But i am going to say, I am 10000000% correct, that someone not attacking us is better than someone attacking us. And I dare anyone to prove me wrong.**
 




 yeah ISIS is a bastion of gay rights.. that should have given someone a clue.. that maybe.. just maybe, they might need to look closer.

Like if you saw a black rights march, will 90% black people and suddenly some come by, carrying a confederate flag.. it might give pause, but if you see no one in the march.. upset in the least.. well you might need to look closer at that flag.

PS occupy wallstreet loves to fly the 'corporate america" flag for similar reasons. A quick view might seem 'hey they are celebrating america. when a closer view says 'no they are, upset at how corporatist america has become.

much like the dildo isis flag and they made it because isis says the same shit you hear american republican say on a daily basis when it comes to gays.
 




 not really sure where to post politics r/politics doesnt approve of.

and like it or not this does have to do with politics.
 









 i dont doubt really.. its not really a complex symbol..i'm sure it has been accidentally drawn in the past by people just making random shapes. 




 yeah thats part of my point. This is being spammed everywhere because the GOP think they can make points by pointing out that she was against gay marriage just like them.

but she changed .. at least her rhetoric, they did not.


i know her stance, my point of being vague was to apply it to all people left or right who you can find with a video denouncing gay marriage back in the past. How they felt in the past is less important than if they accept it now.

hey in my state, many of the politicians who now support bringing the flag down, supported the flag. Call me crazy, but I am going to give them a little praise, even though they are opposite ideology, for growing with the times, and condemn louder the people who dont.

You just cant expect a huge societal change like this and just condemn everyone who was ever against it til the end of time, even if they accept it now.

more downvotes and no debate, I see my detractors have no abilities to defend themselves 




 Clinton charity took up to $10 MILLION donation from African church which called homosexuals 'devils' - despite Hillary's support for gay marriage

her charity accepted money from an anti gay church. a charity she set up but doesnt run and so what? should charities do a background check on everyone who ever donates and give back any money that comes from questionable sources?

do you think a black family wouldnt appreciate food at a food bank given by the klan? and how does that say "we support this group" by taking their charitable contributions.

you might have a point if it was to the campaign.. but this is charity.. they take what they can get and they dont care if you are hitler, the money helps people. no charity would ever return money from an anti what ever.. its not the same as a political donation where you have the fears of like mindedness.
 




 fair enough, but i have lived from nyc to sc, been from cali to texas to washington.. and I have heard the term double park about a million times and have never heard it used for anything besides talking about someone taking up two spaces. Even in NYC. but i have also not been to an area where they are doing this 'double parking"(wiki def)

I guess its the difference between colloquial language and the proper defs.

but honestly i think most american redditors would agree, that the main way they have heard and used the term is for someone taking up two spaces.

thanks for the info that, didnt know the proper def. 




 [Hillary Clinton Praises Gay Marriage Decision and Hounds GOP](http://time.com/3938898/hillary-clinton-gay-marriage/)

[GOP presidential hopefuls deride gay marriage ruling, but differ on what to do about it](http://www.startribune.com/court-decisions-highlight-political-challenges-facing-gop/310250271/)

vote me into the ground if you want, but if you cant admit their is a difference between her response to the ruling and  the rights, you have a problem, not me. And not sure how you missed my first comment was about after the ruling, since i specifically mentioned people whining about it.. and not about her feeling prior. As for the date, that was the date of the video.

thats what my comment was about.. if she would accept the ruling and grow.. or attack the ruling like the right.

LIKE IT OR NOT SHE FUCKING PRAISED THE FUCKING RULING.

she is showing growth.

But hey why recognize that and praise someone for taking the first steps.. and instead pretend she is like the neanderthals talking about making an amendment to over turn it. Yeah thats a great way to advance the cause.


edit: hey downvoter.. dont want to debate? so your saying we should attack the people formerly against gay marriage who accept the ruling today, as much as the people fighting ot overturn it.. and you think that is helpful? I see they can downvote but not debate the issue, which suggests to me they dont have the capacity to support their position and are just downvoting out of spite.

 




 well you do know that the satanic bible was based on her writings, so says the author. Said satanism was basically randianism wrapped up in ceremony. not that it matters much but it is amusing considering the party that most embrasses her is highly christian.
 




 yeah she was against gay marriage when the majority of the country was. So was Obama. The real point, is do they grow and change with the times, like some have, or do they do like others and scream and yell about how its an affront to society?

[Hillary Clinton Praises Gay Marriage Decision and Hounds GOP](http://time.com/3938898/hillary-clinton-gay-marriage/)

downvoters say she never changed. Yeah this speach sounds just like the one in 2004. the point is people who ACCEPT IT and grow versus people who fight it.
 




 For me it doesnt matter really what it meant during the civil war. Its how it was used since. And it was mainly used by the klan before it was put up everywhere protesting desegregation.


and heres the thing, the swastika, used to be a sanskrit symbol meaning "well being".. people dont take kindly to it today, no matter how well being you think you are. Its not what it used to mean, its what it means today.

he could be 100% correct, it should still come down.

(side note, awful used to mean something that filled you with awe(like a general or king), try using it as a compliment today.. shit changes) 




 I moved to the south in HS a long long time ago. And that was one culture shock for me. At least where i lived in the north, there wasnt a lot of thought about the civil war.. it just was this war a long time ago. And we didnt really think of the divide. but when i came south, it was a bigger deal. not that thats all they talked about, but it was more important and they also saw themselves as more of a separate part of the us..not separated but a unique entity.. Than we did up north. To me living up north it was just geographic, but down south is the south.  and yeah i was taught it was all about states rights and questions of federal power. and many slaves fought for the south. and it was a strain between the industrialized north and the farming south that had been brewing since before we were even a country.. going back to the original disagreements when setting up the constitution over federal versus states power.

 




 it isnt that cut and dry and they are only trying to expand an existing service started by reagan. The phone program. TV is also considered a right which is why the government gave out the digital antenna to anyone who asked for one.

a lot of social services is moving online and that saves us money. As well as education and job services. and this isnt for everyone just the extreme poor and most of them will only get money off to buy internet.

one of the selling points giving them phones was they could get jobs. Now most of that, even the crap you find from the state offices, is all online and want online submissions.

but seriously if you say that, you dont have kids. You cant have a kid get educated today, without the net. half their lessons are online crap.

which is why so many schools give all students laptops.

welcome to the future.


 




 and they are talking about expanding the government subsidized phone service started by reagan, to include information access. So people have to tools to better themselves while working a min wage job when they cant afford to go to college. 

they arent talking about net for all.. or even most of us and even then, most of the people who do get it, will only get money off their bill.

its not quite how people are putting it like everyone in the us will get free net. its expanding a telecommunications program that already exists to include data.

you can still disagree but its only for people way below the poverty line and believe it or not more and more social service are being done online and that saves us money, but the poor have to find a kinkos or somewhere to email or fax the forms.


 




 actually you're wrong. telephone access is a basic human right according to our law. his comments were made to the idea of expanding that right to include internet.

They are talking about expanding the phone subsidy program for the poor, to include information access. what people stupidly call obamaphones.. as it started under reagan.

and since we are in ... cordcutters, tv is also a right, which is why the gov gave out all them free digital antennas cause so many of our people still get tv over the airwaves.. cause they cant afford cable.


 




 I'm actually surprised roberts been so vocal and so stupid in most his comments. I'm surprised that i actually agree with alito.. yes people will and have compared it to mixed marriages. CONGRATS for figuring that out. It didnt take the ruling though for us to figure that out.

and yes people who disagree with it will be labeled bigots by society.. which is the choice of society. Nothing forbids you from being a bigot. and to go back to his previous analogy, at one time it wasnt considered bigotry to think of black people as lesser people, our society as a majority accepted it. And times changed and now we call those hold outs to ancient ways, bigots. now in my opinion they always were but the point is it is society that actually decides if that label is appropriate. and... that doesnt take a ruling either.. cause we have been calling them ignorant bigots long before scotus said a word. but he is correct, they will have to put up with the growing reality that society see them as bigots.

 




 you kind of have to..  "sacrifices in vain" and such. like darkeox say, its why he got shot.

 




 the only moving part is the fan, so its the fan.

is there a danger of damage? sure.. it needs to keep the caps cool. It really depends on the psu, some handle wider temp ranges, but its summer and if gaming you will be taxing it.. and if its making noise air flow is probably compromised.

it wont explode.. but it might die.. i'm not even going to say the probability is high(short term).. but if you leave it like that for a long time, yeah.

make sure it is the psu fan and make sure nothing got sucked up in there thats just making noise by the fan hitting it.

you can probably think of it as noisy cv joints, or a squealing brakes.. sure you can drive but if you do a lot and tax it hard they can fail. and more so the cheaper they are.
 




 just cause [i wanted to verify some info..here is the response.](http://blogs.columbian.com/all-politics-is-local/case-closed-on-madores-silly-park-job/).

you can see in the pict, just to the left of that space is the turn for going to the other side. They say cars keep getting clipped.


though i kinda question the reasoning.. [since he used to just double park](http://blogs.columbian.com/all-politics-is-local/madores-park-job-is-meme-of-the-day/)

but to be fair, that is a shit spot to park.

and anyways it is plausible enough looking at that first pict, that i will put away my tar and feathers for now.(and uber dem here. so no not being biased)

 




 its not quite the same.. But i get your gist, people will drink diet drinks while consuming far too many calories and think the diet drink is helping. however this is just random observations.

[I figure the downvotes are due to it being inconclusive on why their is a positive correlation between drinking diet soda and waist size gain in older adults.](http://www.science20.com/news_articles/diet_soda_frequency_linked_to_waist_size_increases-154618)

I believe they arent sure if its has something to do with the alternative sugars and their digestibility, or does the ingestion of diet coke change eating habits.

er from a different link

In the new study, the researchers said that it is not clear exactly why drinking diet soda may be linked to an increase in waist circumference. But it may have something to do with the sweeteners used in diet soda, and the way they may affect food-intake regulation, Fowler said.


 




 I think there is probably at least some of that. Where people think that means dieting.

But i bet some of it is just from,  at least i am doing something. Not that they feel it is actually dieting.  It gives people some feel good about themselves when they arent actually really doing much at all. "i may not be exercising but at least i eat a fitness bar now and then, sure its not enough but its better than not doing anything"

its more about a small excuse to not feel as bad about not exercising.

and of course this is all just conjecture but I see some of myself in that in other subjects (too skinny for the diet concerns) but where i do just enough to feel better about not doing all of what i should. and you use it to help you excuse doing things you used to. "Damn i am running late for work and dont want to take the morning jog(hard), but i will eat this fitness bar at least"...(easy) and eventually the hard stuff gets less while you never miss that easy chocolatey bar.


 




 a little off but basically it.

The people.. told the legislators that they couldnt do it anymore.

they said the government must hire someone else.

This was done by referendum. These are little questions you can vote for at voting time. Like should we switch to this commision to draw districts, yes or no. Now this question is automatically added by the people, if enough people sign petitions to get them added.

the legislators who had the power removed from them, by the people. They didnt have any part of the referendum process, that was put on the ballots by the people and voted on by the people. The legislators simply lost the power to set the lines and were ordered to hire this commission to do it.

they are suing to get back the power, saying the US constitution says the job is the various state legislators(depending on how you read it) and cant be changed by vote by the people, without an amendment process. They are saying the referendum vote cant be binding in this case due to federal supremecy


 




  Each representative in Congress is basically there to speak for a limited number of people

it used to be much more limited. in 1800. each representative averaged 30k constituents. now it is 700k per rep. Of course had we kept the same numbers we would need a much bigger house, as it would have to hold 10,000 reps and their aids.

 




 well you are commenting in a thread where arizona is trying to change the method of gerrymandering... now they definitely arent selecting the condorcet method or anything close, but the fact is they are TRYING TO CHANGE IT. California did manage to change theirs.

i dont think we can dismiss that one day we can change it..

ok so they arent changing very far though.. i mean its light years from condorcet and not that far from normal.. but small changes can eventually lead to dramatic ones.


 




 well it does, after gerrymandering an area, what you tend to get is far more conservative/liberal people. the next census, it is these people who get to set the lines. yeah, sometimes the people can overcome even gerrymandering, but it tends to need the help of someone getting caught with their pants down.. otherwise it just gets reinforced more and more. And thats why we get people who can say the most idiotic shit you have ever heard and not lose their next election. they have the right team flag on their sleeve.
 




 yeah he does great videos explaining the problems, solutions and effects. most people dont think of the process, they just dont like the results. i bet most americans havent even considered the idea that their might be different ways of voting than first past the post.

and first past the post is kinda the default way voting starts and as such kinda feels like the way it should be, until you look at the flaws.
 




 thats what he is saying.. but one caveat.

but I absolutely assure you, Congress has the power to change the constitution.

Not without  ratification from 3/4th the states(their congresses and gov).. so no the federal congress cant do it alone.
 




 wow. it would never be ratified today. 




 well is it the old style rba without the big holes on the side?

people are drilling them out.
 




 OReillys statement is particularly surprising coming from a senior FCC official, given that the FCCs mandate is, among other things, to "encourage the deployment on a reasonable and timely basis of advanced telecommunications capability to all Americans, according to the Telecommunications Act of 1996.

not really.

republicans put anti union people on the labor board.

they put young earthers and global warming denialist in charge of science.

and they made a man who said the un should be raised to the ground, as our lead diplomat to the institution.

its kinda their MO.

 where is the demands for answers from the usual privacy advocates we have in gov? they seem strangely silent on this one.

 lol how does that work. Its a bot. it isnt partisan. it simply looked at op link and turns from a crappy mobile to one we can ready. It doesnt even know what the link is of. It could be praising israel. it could be praising you. All it does is take a mobile link and make the non mobile version which is helpful.

To vote it down is just retarded partisan politics. Its a thing.. it doesnt have an opinion.


 




 for nothing but educational access it is ridiculous to not provide the net to the poor.


screw getting the jobs and everything else.. the right always scream that the poor who work 60-80 hours a week at min wage barely feeding their family, just need to better themselves. Its not always possible or afford for them to go to college, but just maybe some of them, instead of staying in a dead end job that needs welfare assistance, might learn programming and help the us economically.
 




 pretty cool thanks. 




 One leaves on a spaceship at .99% of the speed of light and flies around for awhile. When he returns he finds he is much younger than his brother.

and if that first guy leaves at the 99% of the speed of light.. from the earth.. travels for a year, the second guy, left on earth, builds a better space craft.. this one goes 99.99% the speed of light.. and he sets off in search of his brother.

when they meet.. who is younger now?
 




 it banned selfie sticks because people refused to obey the rules on the rides.

the first ban was saftey concerns, the second ban was idiot concerns.

 I was kinda shocked with how the state responded.  I get they would protect the taxi drivers but.. well idk, even if you think the taxi drivers were right, cowtowing to them and attacking uber right after so many taxi drivers were seen dropping cinder blocks on random cars they thought were uber.. well that just kinda invites politics through rioting and violence.
 




 wow how did you even intepret that that way.?

the coins had the graven image of caesar.
the reason they were asking jesus about paying taxes, is they were trying to trick him. See they figured he would say it was wrong, due to religious law. 

IT CONFLICTED WITH THE LAW OF GOD.

Jesus said, render unto ceaser, meaning the state cant make a sinner out of you, even though the graven image is a front to christianity.


and its not the only time they say that. They actually do say you should follow government because government was created by god.


romans 13

Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God. 2 Consequently, whoever rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves

its a bit clear. but he clears it up more. So what happens if they are an anti christian dick?

Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority? Then do what is right and you will be commended.

you still follow the law, but you also lead by good example and god will help.

but incase it isnt entirely clear.. he goes on.. romans 14

This is also why you pay taxes, for the authorities are Gods servants, who give their full time to governing. 7 Give to everyone what you owe them: If you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then respect; if honor, then honor.

if they tell you to respect and honor gay marriage you have to.
 




 Spending bill would also require religious experts to review recommendations for reproductive technique.

sigh. And what exactly is a religious expert? can you be one when everyone seems to choose what to believe? i know this is /r/science, but these same people dont put any effort behind keeping people from working on sundays compared to what they did to fight gay marriage.. well i have to question anyone who calls themselves an 'expert'.  the verses dealing with gay sex, was something 'god' told someone, where the not working on sunday thing, he wrote in stone... which is actually where we get the phrase, "written in stone" as a sign of permanence. 
 




 WOT?!?

1. lets see that gallup poll. I am interested in seeing it. Not sure the point. Are states banning reality tv? or are you saying the private markets are giving us reality tv when no one wants to watch it?

2. again what is the point? OP's own link shows in 2010.. most people were AGAINST gay marriage. But the scotus ruling did not occur in 2010. it occured in 2015 when MOST PEOPLE ARE FOR IT. are you just claiming that peoples views change over time? Sure i agree, peoples views do change. Not sure what any of that has to do with OPs chart or even the idea the title is trying to convey. please clarify for me.
 




 to be fair, your poll is a measurement of the US, they are talking about individual states, who often passed the bigoted anti gay shit by referendum.


edit; I aint going to claim they are talking about individual states,, cause well politics. I assume they are talking about individual states. 




 i do wonder, why the left doesnt do what the right would have done in this situation... "the supreme court once again slaps down".. obama.. "for his overreaching unamerican policies".. denying americans their god given rights. "this is a good day for america when the supreme court tells the left once again that what they are doing is wrong and illegal"

(yeah the parts out of quotes are just parts the GOP wouldnt say.. this comment is based on the bizzaro world where the GOP supports gay rights, but still respond to things in classic GOP fashion) 




 uganda.. though it might be a  bit dark for them there if you catch my drift. 




 I agree try the removal tool, though its probably best to do a clean install of windows, that will make it feel as new as possible and get rid of all the minor problems than can develop over time.

but why do you want to get rid of eset? I havent used them in a while but in my experience its a good AV with low overhead and low annoyance. 




 Asked directly whether no Palestinian state would be created under his leadership, the prime minister answered: Indeed"

you cant ignore what he said before the election and then expect us to take for golden the shit he said after the election after attacked by the entire planet for the shit he said before the election. You also seem to skip the part about overwhelming the arab vote.. i wonder why.. maybe cause net didnt clarify that bigoted crap huh?

[Netanyahu apologises for warning about Arabs voting in election](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/23/netanyahu-apologises-arabs-israel-warning-voting-election)

we get it... you and net are doing the american southern strategy. YOU scream nigger nigger nigger, and when someone calls you on it you say you were misquoted and what you really wanted to talk about was bussing and charter schools. Same thing the right does. they try to scare right wingers that the minority vote is going to overwhelm theirs. same thing bigot net did.




 Oslo was dead long before then.

so just ignore the mans actually words from his own lips.. and just claim he wants peace. GOT IT.


Sure, some people in Israel and Israel's government have no interest in diplomacy. So? I'm happy to say that, I'm perfectly comfortable with facts.

amazing you admit it.. thats a good first step.

Some Israeli settlers act like terrorists. The majority of them, and the majority of Israelis, do not support attacks on civilians.

this too.

This is false and unrelated

no it isnt, you are attacking me for things I never said. hense strawman.

how the fuck can it be unrelated when we are having this convo right now.. and you are purposefully misrepresenting what i said?


Do you mean 1948?

[nope. I meant 1967](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-Day_War).. you do know the history of the area right? what the whole question about borders is? Most people today accept the 1948 ones.. its the 1967 ones that are the trouble,. Yeah i said 1968 over 1967 but it is more than remarkable you had no clue what i was talking about.
 




 they do it everywhere.

there is actually fertilizer lawn paint. you paint your lawn green and the ferts help it become green ..with proper watering.. later. [here is some grass paint, not sure if this is the one with ferts](http://www.lawnlift.com/products.asp?cc=)

its done a lot in certain communities where...browning grass or even new lawns are kinda frowned upon.. people even do it to sod.. when its just a little to light green from transport. and also used for spot hiding.. like dog urine spots which can really burn brown in the hot dry seasons. 




 NO. Not at all.

not even close.

but they are getting tighter on restrictions.

Now who to believe.. me? or itonlygetsworse. hmmm.. if there was only some way to tell.

[Rich Californians balk at limits: Were not all equal when it comes to water](http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/rich-californians-youll-have-to-pry-the-hoses-from-our-cold-dead-hands/2015/06/13/fac6f998-0e39-11e5-9726-49d6fa26a8c6_story.html)

oh wait there is.
 




 while i get the question, not sure the point.

the rebates weren't a win fall. this isnt a money many opportunity.. well unless you own a succulent store. The rebates cover PART of the costs.. to encourage people to do it.

the main reasons people do it, is maintenance.. its easier and you dont have to worry about the various restrictions on water usage that come now and then. Who cares if you can remember if you can water your lawn on wed, or thurs? you dont have to water your lawn at all.

so whats the point about putting an old lawn back in? if you just want to spend money on a meaningless exercise... maybe but otherwise there isnt any reason to do this.(yeah you might not like the low water plants, but why put them in in the first place? the rebate only gets you some of your expenditures back)



 




 did you see the post the other day on water? [one comment amused me.](http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/rich-californians-youll-have-to-pry-the-hoses-from-our-cold-dead-hands/2015/06/13/fac6f998-0e39-11e5-9726-49d6fa26a8c6_story.html)

 imo, more olivia newton john than madonnas 




  No, it isn't. It's what Abbas admitted he would do back in 2009:

[Israel's PM Netanyahu: No Palestinian state on my watch](http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/16/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-palestinian-state/) he alo demanded right winger israelis overwelm the arab vote, which is pure bigotry. he was using fear like you right wingers always do.

derp much dude? i never said hamas was all the open arms people.. of cause you are talking about the other wing of palistine in your links.. but w/e I SAID THEY WERENT THE SOLE CAUSE.. as you pretend they are.

[Netanyahu admits on video he deceived US to destroy Oslo accord](http://www.thenational.ae/news/world/middle-east/netanyahu-admits-on-video-he-deceived-us-to-destroy-oslo-accord)

lets do an experiment in bias and bigotry and we will see who is the full of shit one.

1. many in palistines leadership have zero interest in peace.

2. hamas military wing is a terrorist org that attacks innocent people

3. the palestinians and arabs helped start this when they went to war in 1968

Now let see you at least admit, that some people in israel and in their leadership have no interest in diplomacy.. you wont explode i promise.

admit that some israelis, especially the settlers act like terrorists.

can you admit any of that? nope. Sorry dude you are ignorant of the situation. I never denied palestine's shit stunk.. i denied that israelis shit smells like roses 100% of the time.

you are attacking strawmen.

 




 well except there are catholics there already and yes this is about letting them build more churches and do more catholic things there.

and if it is so useless why the hell did the right get so fucking upset leading up to this, and so fucking upset when it happened?


i find it interesting the right are all screaming.. the pope needs to stay out of it.. this isnt his business.

and then when it happens and goes against yalls demands "it doesnt matter, it is all meaningless"
 




 peace is impossible with an iraeli leadership that says they refuse to try to achieve peace.

you have no legs to stand on after nets election comments. You dont.

he didnt say "IF they renounce"

he said they would NEVER have a state.

#1 is just horseshit.. not only do they want palistine to agree to disputed borders israel claims before they will come to the table of diplomacy.. but they want israel.. the democracy, to be recognized as a permanent and solely jewish state. And well thats horseshit as well.

really, i think we should just take it away from both groups.. yeah you can live there but the entire area should become a world heritage site for abrahamic religions. And let them all come and live there. Jews, muslims christians. Dont mater and just let the UN run the place.. they created it anyways.

 




 so we demand they vote.. they vote for the wrong people and we take our ball and scream we aint gonna play anymore.
 




 I dont care if he quotes from a bubble gum wrapper as long as it is sourced.. which is better than the dude he is responding to.

you do see them blue underlined words in the blog. Click them. If they go to another blog, you have a point, if they go to legit media.. you dont.
 




  The Middle East/African voting bloc routinely gangs up on them for political/religious/fuck America's client state reasons.

because you say so right?

much like the right says the media is all liberal and they unfairly attack republicans when they point out that NO womens bodies dont have an off switch in case of rape.

Israel is anything but perfect, but they're far and away the best country in the region concerning human rights. 

when they arent runing over americans with bulldozers, kicking palestinians out of their own pools so settlers can use them instead of shooting at farmers harvesting their crops.. and denying gaza access to such dangerous items as biscuits and chocolates.

i dont deny that areas in the region dont have worse trouble.

But here is another rub.. you do realize what your comment is basically saying? its what cops hear all the fucking time.

"WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU BUSTING ME WHEN THERE ARE MURDERERS OUT THERE"

um cause you broke the law. saying their are worse people out their is no justification for breaking the law. It was the same thing the american right said about bush's torture program. "well in iran they do worse" 

so what. It doesnt make it right.  saying theri are worse people doesnt give you the high ground.



 




  The UN report was commissioned by the UNHRC, a body that has condemned Israel more than every other country in the world combined. That is not an unbiased investigation.

yep when ruled against, always claim bias.


I hear criminals who are arrested a lot.. they like to do that to. A dude down the street was arrested 4 times for meth. i havent been arrested once. I dont do meth. I guess the cops are biased against him. duh.


You may be interested in an extensive report [4] detailing how the UN relies on solely Palestinian amateur accounts, and fails to properly investigate.

LOL and israel controls entry into palistine for them to investigate.

LOL

**dude you still lose when you pretend everything is palistine when the leader of israel said they would not have a state on his watch.
**

it doesnt matter how wrong palestine is.. doesnt matter how many rockets. or the un lies. Or the gaza attack. Your dude said he has no interest in diplomacy and you want to put all the blame on palestine.
 




 "before coming to the negotiating table, we demand you give up key parts of the negotiation"

right wingers version of diplomancy.. its called I DONT FUCKING WANT TO DO IT SO I WILL PRETEND I DO.

it was the same with iran.. they demand iran end the nuclear program before we come to the table to discuss the nuclear program.

its solely designed to make it look like your willing to talk when you arent.

also recognizing israel.. they demand that innocuous thing all the time. why do they give a fuck? because it isnt innocuous. In order to recognize a state, you got to recognize the borders.. and they want palistine to give up claim to east jereselum before coming to the table.

**and taaravakin after the election, you really dont have a leg to stand on to claim high ground.**

The bigot fuck net, showed his bigot ass on tv. You cant scream that israelis much counter the israeli arab vote or scream that palestine will never be a state on his watch and then try to claim you are the reasonable one, and its all palestine who wont come to the table.

seriously dude, how the fuck do you think you could? ignoring the left right aspect.. seriously how the fuck do you think you can blame everything on hamas and palistine in the face of the comments of net during the last election? That just baffles me. i can understand bias and your feelings but to be willing to open your mouth in the face of a reality that plainly denies what you are saying, is quite interesting. Do you want to claim the sun is purple? 




 not really, just some biased person trying to dillute it.



The Vatican has agreed to a new treaty with Palestinian representatives that refers to them as the State of Palestine, which the Associated Press is reporting as formal recognition of Palestine as a state. A Vatican spokesman told AP, "Yes, it's a recognition that the state exists."
The Vatican recognized Palestine as a state after a 2012 UN vote, but this is the first official agreement the Vatican has concluded that recognizes "the state of Palestine." 

saying "hey we think you are a state" is all and great in 2012.. putting it down on paper is saying .. WE MEAN IT.


and [for something meaningless.. they were immediately attacked for it.]
(http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/vatican-recognizes-state-palestine-new-treaty-n358286)

**thats right folks.. the left are making a huge deal about absolutely nothing just for political and media purposes... and right wingers like the one above, also totally feel it is nothing.**  

/s

sorry dude, if republicans can attack the pope for dare recognizing palistinian statehood with this treaty, we can cheer it.

edit: dederped a link
 




 It will only convince the Palestinian leadership that they need not unify and reform, or negotiate, as Netanyahu has offered to do and Abbas has refused.

thats why the downvotes dude.. thats a bit more than simplistic.

net was on record in his election for saying they would never ever get a state.

and now you want to pretend that it is israel that is all open to compromise but them dirty palistinians are standing in the way of theri own statehood.

and well thats a horse shit view of the situation. Yes many in hamas dont want negotiations. they gained power and maintain power through conflict with the israels.. MUCH LIKE LIKUD,, who derives its power from the conflict with the palestinians.

I didnt downvote you.. but i would have upvoted you without that stupid line based on ignorance.

 




 yea and that was the fears at the time.. But you know some line in the sand type folks.. said fuck you this is our flag.

though in hindsight it is fitting.
 




 eh i am discussing both.. i would like to hear about the ignorance and bigotry that designed these other flags so i can judge if it is similar. But i remain skeptical without examples. I will never TIL from a sourceless comment.
 




 No one is denying that.

but people being racist, doesnt all of a sudden equate that they designed their flags for racist reasons. Some of us need a bit more proof. and if you know european history.. then share. 


give me one single flag that was created for racist reasons. I WANT TO LEARN.
 




 ok educate me, I like flags but not really an aficionado and well this is the net, and people just saying things that are sorta vague.. well give me some examples man. not doubting you, not educated enough on the various flags to actually deny your claim. So cure my ignorance.

like one example i for the longest time was misinformed that the black in the jamaican flag represented black people, but if you look the original meaning was hardship. I was misinformed by someone who claimed to know. And rather than google every flag in europe and africa, if you could give me examples so i can verify you arent like my friend, and i can make a better decision on why they made their flags the way they did.

I mean if you do find a flag where the white represented "the people" in a mostly homogenous nation of white people, i dont think that really counts in the same way. They didnt make the flag for whites.. its just their nation didnt have black people in it when the flag was made.
 




 i dont see it.

We will put massive pressure on them. and do you think the nsa doesnt have a dossier on her? private info they could use to pressure? i am slightly hopeful cause france told us to fuck off over iraq but that was quite some time ago and the beast has only grown since then/.
 




 Horseshit. I dont know if you were educated in the south, or just falling for some spun ass nonsense.

Yes it came back in the civil rights era.. but even back in the civil war it was pure racism.

here

[Heres the Racist Meaning Of the Confederate Flag, In the Words of the Man Who Designed It](http://mic.com/articles/121082/here-s-the-racist-meaning-of-the-confederate-flag-in-the-words-of-the-man-who-designed-it)

transcribed from the picture.

it would soon rank among the proudest ensigns of the nations and be hailed by the civilized world as THE WHITE MAN'S FLAG.

IT was always bigoted.

it also represented the confederacy.. which we will ignore was the enemy. The confederacy constitution in the preamble said it was all about slavery.. and that white people have the inalienable right to own blacks.


and you can read quotes from the [confederate leaders at the start of the war](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/06/what-this-cruel-war-was-over/396482/)

your falling for the same horseshit, this bigoed asshol is spewing. Sorry but its a total aberration of history to claim this flag had anything at all to do with anything but bigotry. **From the flag creator, to the constitution ot their leaders, they all admit it it was all about bigotry. not sure why so many cant today.**

 




 semantics.
 




 While i wish he would. Seems like a good idea and all, you cant pick a good guy and then just complain hes not doing enough. because you can always find more things he could do.

should he invest in these companies, maybe not, but not going to become a gates hater over it. And his investing doesnt really change anything, its demand and governments are the only thing that can.. its not like the oil companies will go out of business cause gates sold their stock. Really everyone could, and it might hurt some ceos a little, but mostly all it would do is decrease the price/earnings ratio.. make the stock look more attractive.

 




 [unchecky is a godsend.. ](http://unchecky.com/) 




 this is unfathomable. 




 Bristol Palin later became a paid spokeswoman advocating abstinence 

well..

[Non-Profit Pays Bristol Palin $262,500, Donates Only $35,000 to Charity](http://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2011/04/06/non-profit-pays-bristol-palin-262500-donates-only-35000-to-charity/)

but i guess abstinese education doesnt cost a lot.

 




 she does more than preach.. [she got paid nearly 300k to work at a non profit designed to prevent teen pregnancies.](http://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2011/04/06/non-profit-pays-bristol-palin-262500-donates-only-35000-to-charity/) (they only spent 35k on preventing pregnacies. lol but to be fair, it doesnt cost much to say 'dont fuck')

anyone can say you shouldnt smoke and then be caught smoking, but to run an smoking group, and get caught, well thats a bigger story. 




 point out ones hypocrisy and showing that the ideas they present for others, failed themselves, is not shaming her.

see if it was the Obamas girls, some words like "trash" would come up, there would be a huge deal if she wasnt married, because you know black people are like that. etc

hypocracy like ignorance is curable, who you are isnt. now maybe there is media out there calling her trash.. i dont know i dont watch a lot fo the tv news, so if there is, i appologize but.. i'm just calling her a hypocrite. She could otherwise be a fine, nice young lady. 




 idk, in election season when we still have the same types out their promoting this crap, its still a good example for why its a bad idea. It really wouldnt matter that it was the palins.. or the obamas to be honest.. republican, dem i dont care. Not the point. She and her family promoted abstinence. She also LEAD a teen pregnancy prevention non profit.  Just like anti gay guys turning out to be gay... I'm not so sure I agree with you on the burying, as fox wouldnt bury it if it wasnt a republican. People like to read about that kind of stark hypocrisy and most of the time the media gives it to us.  




 why not post at /r/legaladvice 
there probably is some tax advice subreddit.. idk

but heres what i know.

the $600 requirement isnt directed at you the payee. The $600 requirement is directed at them, the payor.

IF they pay any individual over $600 they are required to send you and the irs a 1099.  That is a requirement directed at the people who pay you. But it is to help them catch a lot of people that have been going under the radar.. people who get paid small chump change.

now here is the part your not going to like. Thats just the reporting requirements of the people who pay you. YOU are supposed to file taxes anyways. Even on just that $300. No really, your supposed to list it as income.

but like paying sales tax for catalogues, almost no one actually files the taxes unless they get a 1099 or earn over $600 from one company. and almost no one gets in trouble. The thing is they dont file a 1099 on you until you get over 600.. so... the irs doesnt really know you made 300. Could you get in trouble, sure, and your mom could get in trouble for not paying sales tax on all her catalogue purchases like no one has ever done ever but are supposed to do. But most likely you wont.(if you did it a fuck ton, maybe.. like split it up in 500 dollar chunks between 100 companies.. well it might become noticeable) and really the irs is too broke to go after little fish rn. the right punished them for the irsgate nonsense and cut their budget a lot and obamacare added a fuck ton more work for them. so they kinda up to theri necks right now.

not a lawyer, or an accountant, or work for the irs, take this for what you will, but I attest it is mostly true. :)
 




 enhanced interrogation sounds much nicer. 




 I kinda think he was being humorous, kinda saying they are just taking the long trip to designing a desktop pc.

but yeah i do think people wouldnt mind a station they could plug in the laptop at home for more gaming..  




 The proposed bill is aimed at cracking down on the visual blight that occurs when vehicle owners store cars that dont work on their property.

how about address the problem? Just make sure they dont let cars fall apart on the streets. There should be zero reason you cant put a non working car under a car cover, or maintain it by washing a non working car or even a working car, while you get on your feet until you can afford insurance and legally drive. the problem isnt a lack of plates. the problem is letting cars get covered in crud and look like shit. 

when they do this, i question the motive, because it would be easy to target the actual problem rather than throw out a broad net and make everyone park face forward in theri drive ways and have plates seen from the streets to make sure theri car isnt visual blight? how the fuck does a plate not make it a visual blight? can i put a plate on a car and let it sit there with flat tires, covered in crude and concert fliers? thats what they are saying? they cant tell the visual blight cars without a plate..er what? if you cant tell you cant argue its a visual blight.

 




 there is no obamacare.. there is exchanges for the market place to compete for people on the individual market all in one place.. and some subsidies and crap. This is republicans counting on their base not knowing wtf Obamacare is.

they are trying to say it is so distasteful to get insurance this way that teh supreme court justices would refuse or something. Yeah it would end up costing them more than the free insurance they are provided.. but its just fucking insurance. There is no special obama to it. Its the same insurance you get at work.. just at work its cheaper because it is bought in bulk. this is a way to bring the costs down on the individual market.


anyways its a bit hilarious petty to try to punish scotus for a ruling they didnt like. Can you imagine if Obama tried to punish scotus  for ruling against his recess appointments or his abortion center buffer zone? I think he would already be under impeachment.
 




 [not real](http://m.snopes.com/texas-woman-pregnant-by-pig/)


and come on who would report it to the media? her hyper religious parents? 




 well except it IS working. 




 no 20% healthcare costs isnt a positive, but it is in a positive direction compared to the 35% we were starting to see.

i swear some people do all they can to not admit things like that. we are mostly all in agreement on single payer. Most of us think obamacare isnt that great.. but its better than what we had.

 




 the jobless young people will get subsidies or medicare.. the ones with jobs will have to pay.
 




 and now your just being a dick. the concept that everyone should have perfect prose, when not everyone is english or grammatically oriented and considering the various idiocies of the language is a bit extreme. So I must assume you are just being a prick. Good on you. you right short worthless comments that are perfectly punctuated.  I wonder how you are at calculous.

this place is casual in nature and the comments are disposable. No one is going to read this tomorrow. And just like when i make mock devices of something i want to build. I dont make it perfect. I make it good enough to work. I find people like you just want to hijack the convo and make it about grammar rather than discussing the content of the comment someone made. Its a bit low effort.
 




 I have a feeling you happen to be a libertarian/right winger version of an atheist? Most people didnt seem to actually have that much trouble understanding the concepts, that i was trying to convey.  While admittedly it isnt the cleanest prose, it is hardly as incoherent as your post. I suspect, your disagreement has more to do with politics than punctuation.
 




 i did miss use some punctuation, but I'm not trying to be published, just talking with like minded friends. I'd definitely clean my work up for commercial or educational purposes, but i tend to not proof read or care as much when its idle conversation. Not that its a valid excuse to write so poorly, but it is what it is.
 




 true but you got to give it to her for keeping her eye on the ball. she had a razor focus, and yeah in slow mo, but as a crappy golfer myself, i'm easily distracted by anything but the ball.
 




 they could afford to do both, often it has to do more with regulatory ideas.. and google wants to be able to reach everyone.. while fiber is great, there is a reason why they want free wifi...and NYC is a bit of a hotbed of tourism.. tourist walking around town.. needing info...on where to go. Google is mainly an advertising company. Tourists are some of the best cut of the consumer meat.  




 she wasnt wrong.. you people dont get it.

When conservatives fail and become pregnant it is called being human.. and has nothing to do with the abstinence.

when liberals do, its due to their crappy ideology that encourages teens to get pregnant as soon and as often as possible with as many species as possible.

(and yeah this is about religion, but its the right winger version that tries to force the ideas on others, where the left winger version might believe that it is wrong but believe in leading by example over leading by legislation)

**edit:** and to forgive the right a little in this concept, people in general tend to do this-- just this current subject is more conservative.But we tend to judge ourselves by our intentions,while we judge others by their actions. When i cut you off, its an accident, i was a little off today.. sorry. When you cut me off its cause your a fucking idiot who doesnt know how to fucking drive and prolly got his dl in a box of cracker jacks anyways.(eh atheism isnt the politics of left versus right and wanted to pull back a little)
 




 Both... well now looks like just one. 
Warm waters tend to bleach corals, while acidification makes it harder to get the carbon to make theri structures.

This article however is stating that some species will do ok, and so it will adjust, but some will die out. and its mainly investigating why some corals can rapidly adapt to temps while other species cant.

unlike the title, the study isnt saying that.. it says they can and are and will be adapting to a warmer ocean. Not to global warming itself, since that includes not only warming but the acidification.(which i believe would also happen with natural warming but much latter due to co2 feedback from warmth.. whereas with  AGW we put the co2 into the air already)

Now i guess someone might say.. well wait, if they say some corals evolved from warmer times and other corals that evolved from those corals have an easier time evolving with the heat than those who didnt have such a past. Shouldnt they have the same with acid.. since i say it will get acidic anyways. And while i am not in this field.. I would have to say no this doesnt prove that. While it might prove the corals have mechanism for quickly dealing with quickly rising temps, it doesnt show it has the mechanism to survive with quickly rising acidity even if its ancestors survived in a more acidic environment..  




 well its more than 'cant stand the heat'

and most of the argument is actually that its better AND CHEAPER to mitigate some of the problems now, than wait until later when its much more expensive and harder to do.

almost no one says humans will die out.

and had we started sooner, like in the 2000s with the plans on the tables back then, we would have been able to mitigate the effects even more.. the longer we wait, the more we will have to "just deal with"
 




 ok on the first sentence, bah on the second.

thats just click bait bs.

had 911 been successful the deaths would have been much higher.. but one plane crashed in a field and another the terrorists never made it on.

and judging how many would die on success is a bit of an art than science.  you can make some guesses, but they are only really educated guesses.
 




 kinda unfortunately reddit doesnt allow editing titles even to self posts. I get some of the dangers but you could easily implement some tracking of changes like wiki where people can click and see past titles and such and make up their own minds if shenanigans is going on or if the changes were legit.

there have been a couple posts of mine, that made it to teh front of reddit, where comment information changed what the title should say.. and my title was suddenly misleading IMO and i couldnt do anything about it.. and since so many people dont click through or read the comments, .. i was doing damage that i couldnt stop.

i am glad these days they have at least let mods add a little flair to titles so they can say "debunked".. or "mirror in comments".."not real, viral ad" but they really should let us to fix titles... hey send a message to everyone who voted that the title was changed to let them change theri vote.. fine, but they should let us fix titles.

 




 yeah, having messed with markup over the years, while this might not be aesthetically pleasing compared to some more graphic articles. Its extremely pleasing in the medium it was done in. 




 yeah  good point but i bet it is still pretty similar. your just going to know more about those industries if you live there.  Your going to have relatives and friends in them. And your more likely to hear info, that you might not hear from other sources. And the local consumable media tends to be biased towards the local industries. yoru going to get a more positive view. 




 my grands house still has the old ones inside.. for a few storage areas. I developed a thing for big ass old keys for a short time as a kid.
 




 YOu still cant seem to grasp the point.

tell me is theri a difference between what a klan uniform is designed for, and what a bed sheet is designed for? think anyone was raped on a bed sheet? well bigotry and rape are both wrong but ONE IS DESIGNED FOR THE PURPOSE OF BIGOTRY.. the other wasnt designed for rape.. it was just used that way.

same with your examples. You fail because the conservative flag was designed for bigotry.. read their constitution as well as the words of the dude who created it who put it on an all white background because it was the white mans flag.

and it was put up all over the south SPECIFICALLY for bigotry reasons to protest desegregation.

YES THE AMERICAN FLAG HAS BEEN ABUSED.. just like a rape happening on a bed sheet. But the american flag wasnt designed to promote abuse, nation building or anything else. 

THE CONFEDERATE FLAG WAS DESIGNED TO PROMOTE BIGOTRY.

not sure why yall dont get the different between use and abuse.


maybe i should try the right winger verision.

And electric chair purpose is to kill people.

thats not always true with guns., especially things like shot guns which were explicitly designed for hunting. But people do kill people with shot guns. That is abusing the guns purpose.  The chair on the other hand HAS THE SOLE PURPOSE of killing people.

its the same difference between the american flag, which was designed to be the flag of this nation, versus the confederate flag which was designed to be the flag of the white man.. in the designers own words.
 




 yeah and he wrote about how much the golds gym ideology helped promote his madness.

derp much dude?
 




 MOTHER FUCKER.

the civil war was fought over slavery.. its in theri constitution

Motehr fucker.. the flag was put up only to protest civil rights by threatening a new civil war.. it wasnt put up to celebrate any heritage or history.

the american flag... while it has been abused all over.. wasnt designed to be bigoted. And the pyramids while built by egyptions werent designed solely to spit in the face of the jews.

the confederate flag was. Thats why yall put it up during civil rights, and not at some special civil war holiday.

besides its the fucking enemy of the us.

you do realize many fucking germans have nazis as relatives? you dont think it would be condemened by the planet for parts of germany to start to display that flag all over their governments for "heritage" reasons

DONT BE A JACKASS MOTHERFUCKER.

we can debate the issue without either side being jackassses MOTHERFUCKER.


 




 yeah i actually think its a bit retarded what apple did.

but the flag was addopted by the klan to attack blacks with.

it was never historically part of SC besides for the klan.

until the civil rights era when right wingers threatened a new civil war.. and raised the northern virgina regiments flag all over the south.

most people dont have a problem with the flag.. the problem is when the governments promote it. and even if you scream heritage which is pretty ignorant since it wasnt put up to celebrate teh civil war but to fight civil rights, its the flag of the enemy of the US. and right wingers got upset and legit so, when a small spanish town had the mexican flag flying over the post office. This is america. but see historically that small spanish town.. USED TO BE MEXICO.. they have heritage as well. Doesnt matter This is america. They can fly the flag at their homes but leave the government out of it.

right wingers seem to grasp that in all things until the government promotes theri ideas and then they all play dumb.


well just like the mexican flag doesnt belong flying over any gov building in mexico the losing confederate flag has zero business flying over gov buildings in the US. The gov should be as generic as it comes when it comes to promoting of ideas. 

you dont need a fucking christmas display at the state house.. what fucking purpose does that serve besides telling non christians that this is a christian biased state?

we shouldnt have speciality plates for your car.. people cant afford a fucking bumper sticker?


shit from the gov should be cold generic and limited to the state flag and the us flag.

you can celebrate heritage and ideas at home. 




 so making less than min wage, is hard to keep up motivation.. who knew.(yeah i know many of us just use it as a way to get money you dont feel bad about blowing and have other income.. still point stands.. below min wage as far as the buying power it affords is not very motivating once you have already eaten)

and to ramble on, it doesnt even have to be about money.. you can see it some in games and things. scbuildit is an ok game on the android. They have these things called expansion items which let you expand your territory, they are semi rare in finding. but after so many clicks on average you will get one. well they just updated the game, adding a different expansion area and 3 more expansion parts.. the gist of it all is that it now takes more clicks to expand the game than it did before... basically they cut my imaginary game salary i got for the labor i did in click bubbles. and well i am not motivated to play anymore.




yeah everyone goes through it.  




 yeah annoying af 




 you are actually going to link teh american shitter to help this dude understand? fuck might as well linked what teh council of conservative citizens thinks on it.(for teh canadian the american shitter simply exists to attack the left in all things, doesnt matter what it is, a right winger could shoot another right winger in the face and it would be the lefts fault.. they complain fox was attacked when fox tried to claim it wasnt about race.. it ws about christians and was due to obama and affirmative action.. they deserved attack.)

could you get a more partisan hyper right winger source?

teh flag wasnt in use in most of the south.. it was the battle flag of the northern virginia regiment of the confederacy. IT WAS HOWEVER adopted by hyper bigot groups like the klan.. and until teh civil rights era, thats pretty much the only people who used it. 



but really dont read that american shitter article.. you will just get more misinformed..AND YEAH I WOULD SAY THE SAME IF IT WAS AN ARTICLE FROM THE BLACK PANTHERS.

you simply wont get any sort of a view of reality from people as partisan as the american shitter or the black panthers.


edit: ok i guess your trying to show how the right are being.. it wasnt totally clear by your link title.

teh [confederate flag is basically an extension of the rights bigoted southern strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_strategy) designed specifically to foster distrust betweeen the the races in order to attract the bigot vote, who fled the dem party when the dems adopted civil rights. and its the main reason for the wink wink nudge nudge.. no it isnt about racism
 




 but there are still problems with that concept.


for a more cogent example than the ones we have used. Some of the more people based and vague laws.. like indecency. If you look back at how a person in the 1700 might interpret indecency laws... well women today still wouldnt be allowed show above their ankles 




 so that means no free speech on computers because no one in the 1700s would have interpret it to include these type devices. ...

ok some might take exception with my example but the problem with his view is that society progresses. People in teh 1700 might not think free speech applies to hustler but then again they didnt have a concept of magazine and porn of that nature.

thats not to say certain laws dont actually NEED to be fixed to adjust with the times, but some we just shouldnt have to.. just because the medium changes.

you can say i am reading too much into how he does things but there are concepts that it just doesnt seem to make sense to say 'how would someone from 300 years ago interpret this' 




 they actually used to look like that.. which is why the graphic stuck around... sorta like the save button in word programs often looks like a diskette.


and [phones dont look like this](http://4vector.com/i/free-vector-phone-clip-art_110132_Phone_clip_art_hight.png)

but of course a plain white square on a black background might not say phone to people these days so prolly best we kept the old model graphic. :)
 




 its pretty cool.. but i wonder why this hasnt been done sooner. 

People doing bitcoin have been making theri cards external for a long time now with risers. i get it isnt quite the same but it also isnt quite that far away from it all.
 




 from the link click through in the article just cause i liked it.

In the mid-1980s, after consulting with Drucker, furniture maker Herman Miller (MLHR) agreed that its CEO's pay would be restricted to 20 times the average of all its employees. "The subtle part of this limit was the message to the CEO: If you want to get more pay, you need to do it by raising the average pay" of everyone at the company.

thats teem work. everyone from the janitor to the ceo working on the same goals. And i bet all feel valued like part of a company rather than a worthless product to be dropped on a whim. 




 they should fight for basic income over fighting for jobs. 




 one of the problems that society is facing and will get worse, is the jobs are going to disappear. Its the evolutionary direction of technology.. its kinda the point. We invent things to do the things we dont like to do for us. To free up time to do other things.  We dont have to wash our own clothes by hand which takes forever and is hard and sucks.. we throw it in a big white box, push a button and go do something else.

The luddites were before their time for sure, when technology came for the unskilled jobs, besides new unskilled jobs were created, people could better themselves as some like to cry. But there was a growth in need for skilled labor. Well now they are coming for the skilled jobs, and theres not going to be anywhere for humans to better ourselves into.. there is skilled or unskilled.. there isnt another rung.

at that point the only people with wealth, are those that own the means of production and all the robots.

there will probably be reforms we dont like that are needed as we implement BI.. but eventually there wont be a lot of choice, unless we just want to watch a lot of society die off.and yeah thats a bit off.. but it is the eventual course technology takes us.(and sorry but soon enough computers will even be better programmers than us, so saying everyone will just have jobs making the robots, well robots will take those jobs too eventually)

and yeah, i'm just an insane redditor.. lots of people make excuses and babble about shit that just has no bearing on reality. but luckily i aint the only one that says this.

[Bill Gates thinks super machines could eventually become smarter than humans and take our jobs](http://www.businessinsider.com/bill-gates-artificial-intelligence-2015-3) (who wouldnt be the type of person to make up luddite conspiracy stories cause they are stuck in a dead end min wage job) 




 well after arguing with one of them anti gov types on why the government NEEDs to do min wage(under current system).. who uses similar verbiage.... I have to say i do agree with you, and him, but only if their was a BI already. 

I very much disagree without it, as you can see the effects of not having one in our history and in other countries right now, as our corps like walmart try to go back to paying people in corporate script or walmart bucks that could only be spent at the company store .. in mexico. Its the same games of desperation the robber barons did in the past. The reason the magic doesnt work, is people NEED TO EAT... its sign the contract or starve.. you can say there are others.. but the point is eventually YOU HAVE to sign one.. or starve or turn to crime. With a BI this opens the freedom for the magic of the markets to actually be realized. being able to eat people can sign the contracts based on the value of their labor hours and not the value of not starving to death.(which you can imagine.. is quite low.. I mean if someone was literally starving in front of you, you could probably get a fuck ton of labor for a sandwich)


**tl;dr** the contractional freedoms thing doesnt work without BI, cause the guy hiring can wait longer for an employee than the hirees can wait for food.
 




 not really.

i mean there are arguments against gravity too but the thing is their are things called experiments and we got 50 states of them, many had min wages before the fed government. They didnt add them for no fucking reason. They added them because we already tried it your way.

you can also see it being abused by american companies in mexico where they pay peopl ethey way you folks want.. in walmart script.. where the employees couldnt spend their pay anywhere but the company store.

you can see the problems in china to where people have to deal with the conditions we fought to get out of. Working fo 25 cents an hour, locked in a factory with no ac and many work place accidents.

this shit didnt come because some leftie had a wet dream

it came because people were suffering from trying its yalls way

the world wasnt invented with min wage

we tried it your way for years

I dont know why yall dont understand that

we tried your way

IT FAILED

bad

PS states with a higher "price floor" did better than those who didnt.

thats calls a failure of hypothesis.

[States That Raised Minimum Wage See Faster Job Growth, Report Says](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2014/07/19/332879409/states-that-raised-minimum-wage-see-faster-job-growth-report-says)
 




 well this is a horse shit view.
you same people say some of the problems with college is not everyone can go.

like it or not people do work for life with families at min wage, despite you right wingers pretending this isnt true.


and for less than they did in 1968 despite american is twice as rich per capita and adjusted for inflation.. people like you demand they work for less than they did in 1968.

and yeah we get why right wingers spread these bullshit memes. Its because most people who do work min wage for life, raising familys working 80 hours a week as people like you call them lazy and tell them they need to go back to school and better themselves while working 80 hours a week and raising a family and cry if they ask for help. Sorry dude the reality is people do and have always worked for min wage as a living. and saying "just better yourself" is some ignorant fox news watching mother fucking shit on the state of america today.
