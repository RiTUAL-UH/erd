 I thought that possibly too, but if OP's baby was screaming because of the entity, then I don't think I'd rule it a nice one. 




 It's always interesting to meet a fellow empath. I've been sensitive to pretty much all energies. I know it can get overwhelming too, so let me be the first to say I believe you! I've dealt with several supernatural entities over the years, and I really do think they mess with us just because we can notice them easier than other people. It's scary to know something's in your house that can move things and touch you, especially when you may be the only one who notices. I hope the entities you've encountered haven't been too oppressive over the years, they can really drain you. 
























 It sounds like you guys may have an entity in your house. It can be attached to the house, land, or one of you. I agree with alot of the other posters about trying a night or two away from home. If it follows you, then its not the house. Might I suggest those shake-battery flashlights. If power fails, kinetic energy will likely prevail at least. Here's a question for Shauna: Have you ever dabbled in the supernatural? Playing with Ouija boards or trying to talk to spirits in graveyards, or the like? Sometimes it can cause something to pay attention to you. I know OP said he had toyed with one before. They have been known to bring about bad entities, and it may not show itself right away either. Sorry if it doesnt ease your worries any, but I'm trying to throw up any possibilites at this point. 




 oh wow! I've never thought of using quartz for grounding. I know it can hold energy though. I usually use my bare feet on the ground for grounding. I do get the whole feeling a spirit but not communicating with it thing. I am sensitive to the energy they emit, but the stronger ones can make contact with me, most often when I'm half asleep... (normally just their voice, but sometimes they will show themselves) which is why I sleep cocooned in my blanket for the most part. I pick up on people's moods so easy, though it doesnt really work unless I'm on the phone or in person. I have walls in place to block most of it, but its really hard to tune it out if I make eye contact, which is why I very rarely do. Makes job interviews difficult, but otherwise it's bearable. The only odd upside I've found is I'll get a song in my head, instantly turn on the radio, and there it is :) 
























 It sounds like a possession and exorcism 




 two words: restraining order. Tell the cops she has threatened you and your family. You may not have to even go into details, especially if you tell them you're scared for the lives of your loved ones. I'd definitely tell the cops about the note being in the house! 
























 two words... don't blink! seriously creepy though! 




 That is crazy freaky! It sounds like this guy might know something you don't. The question is why would he say leave? Have you ever messed with ouija boards or the like? Maybe ventured into any creepy abandoned buildings? 
























 When I had my son they had to go HUNT DOWN the doctor... an hour after my epi wore off and the nurse couldn't do anything. That sorry bald man was in the breakroom! I spent an extra hour in labor for him to eat pizza and watch tv. Whats up with these sorry doctors nowadays? honestly, OP you have all rights to be in the room with your wife. Kick his ass if he steps outta line the slightest bit! 




 Oh wow. Your writing style is amazing OP! Being from the south too (GA) I appreciate your beautiful imagery. There's nothing quite like the south. I'm sorry you had to witness that. I really do hope you can come to peace with it yourself (I know that's going to take some time). I'd like to think she found peace before that final plunge. I was almost taken by the currents at Myrtle Beach when I was 13 during a youth trip with the church. I was dragged a mile down the shoreline, and luckily I caught a break in the current (like how between two there's a calm spot?) and was able to get back to shore. I wasn't in too far, but I was just out of touching range and apparently not a strong enough swimmer for those currents. They only had yellow flags out that day. I'd hate to think what may have happened if I'd ventured out there during red flags. There were no lifeguards posted. 
























 Thank you for posting this OP! I thought I was the only one who believed all the 'gods' are one being that has been interpreted differently by different cultures. I also agree with the thought of moving to another dimension in energy form. Wasn't it Einstein that said energy cannot be created or destroyed, it only changes form? This has made my day :) 




 This sounds like it could be SP, but that doesn't explain the weird coincidences you've encountered. I'm starting to think you may be astral projecting, which would explain the boy seeing an 'angel', but not sure about the woman in the hospital. I've never heard of changing how you look during AP but I guess anything's possible. I agree with the sleep study idea. You are basically videoed as you sleep in a bed in a study room (they're quite comfy btw). I've never undergone one, but my mom works with a company that does. 
























 aw, man! That reminds me of some Stephen King mess. Glad you're ok OP! At least they wont be hurting any more people!  





























 Sounds like you, dear have caught the attention of a demon. Thats gonna be a headache to resolve, but not impossible. You need someone who's spiritually strong to help you get rid of it. 




 I'd definitely put as much space between it and you as possible. Who knows what they were planning down there!
