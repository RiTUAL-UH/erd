 Thanks for the feedback, i try to come up with new ideas :) 




 Its ok was a small experiment 










































































 Hope you were'nt too creeped out   




 Thank you. Yeah it becomes very sudden.. 












































 so. In many movies or tv shows (Buffy comes to mind) vampires lose their souls upon turning. A take i dont really like. That would make turning into a vampire totaly...meaningless.. Since you would just wake up after death in heaven/hell/whatever while your body walks around still on earth! Just a thought...lol.. 




 Good question!  












































 Heck yeah! This was a great video! 



















 Im kind of experimenting, hence the warning. Lol.  




 Now i remember! Played that long ago lol 




 Yeah it does kind off :)
