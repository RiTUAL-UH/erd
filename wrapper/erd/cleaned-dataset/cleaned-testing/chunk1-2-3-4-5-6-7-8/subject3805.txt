 I've never really thought about that, but that's very possible. I will try bringing it up to them, hopefully they take me seriously  




 That a good idea, I just want to go see someone I trust. I'm trying to work up the courage to, last night I had a horrible night and I hope she will take me seriously 




 Internet hugs to you too, I'm glad someone's on my side! 




 Thank you for the advice, good luck to you too. I tried talking to the school counselor once after my mom and I had this big fight over nothing (she threatened to leave the family) and that was around the time I started getting overworked about things. She was okay to talk to, but its hard for me to open up to people and I couldn't find the strength to to her. I hope you find help too!  




 Thanks, I will try that!   
























 It does help me but not when my friends think I'm a shitty person for doing it 




 I know, I should, it does relieve anxiety when I have it, but I have anxiety since the people I know just think its a bad thing 




 the method is great - and so easy to use once you get the hang of it!! 




 Yes, before it would get very bunched up and hard to work with, thanks for this tip! 




 This helped SO much. Great visual!!!! 




 Thanks! I'm going to do this!

 Thats a great idea but do you think a rug could be made with 200 yds? 




 A little while ago i purchased 2 skeins of Loops  Threads T-shirt yarn in some natural colors and I have no idea what I want to make with it! It is bulky yarn, I was thinking a simple hat but wanted to know if anyone had any ideas if they've used this yarn before or have seen some great ideas. All i can find is loosely knit cowls and hats and dont like the very loose look. Ravelry only has a few projects, and most of them are crochet. Any and all ideas are welcome! Thanks :) 




 I never even thought about this - it would make life so much easier. Thanks! That will give me a clearer idea of how the gusset is progressing as well 




 Thank you! You're right, the thumb looked a bit iffy to me but i didn't take that into consideration. Ill knit it out, and if turns out wrong, try formatting my pattern better. 




 Thank you for the reply! I apologize for the wall of text, i see its way too long and not going to attract anyone, but you did give me some very useful information about gussets. Thank you. Just one question - it wont look disproportional if theres say 70 stitches on the body of the glove and 60 (at least) after the gusset? It seems strange to me but i guess I'll go with the flow and how im interpreting this pattern. Thanks, and I'll remember to try to keep to a more simplistic style of explanation next time. :) 




 I need some fellow knitters' awesome advice and help please - I started knitting the Sweet Life mittens I found on Ravelry a little while ago. Having never done a gusset in my life before (I've only been knitting scarves and hats), I'm having trouble trying to decode this pattern. Here is the original pattern for the left hand gusset that the author wrote (keep in mind the patterned part is only on the top, there is ribbing underneath, and I'm knitting in the round):

Left Mitt Gusset
Knit in pattern to last 2 K sts, move marker to this spot. Increase two sts between the final 2 sts
by picking up the stitch below and knitting into the front and back of that stitch. Knit in pattern for two rounds. At the third round continue pattern, Slip marker. Kfb the next stitch, knit across gusset and kfb the last stitch in the round. You will continue in this manner, increasing 2 sts every third round, until you have 12sts in your gusset. Knit one round in pattern. At the end of the round remove the gusset sts to waste yarn. In the space left by the gusset sts, CO 6 sts. Knit 2 rounds in pattern. On the third round K2tog after Marker and again for the last two sts in round. Continue in this manner decreasing 2 stitches every third row until you are back to the original (36, 48) stitch count. Knit in pattern until 7.5 inches long.

So I have attempted to write this in an easier form for myself, row by row. Here is the majority of my attempt:

left gusset pattern written out:
1: repeat #2, last two knit stitches in pattern, move marker HERE. increase between next two stitches 2 stitches by m1 and kfb that stitch
2: repeat #3
3: repeat #4, after marker slip kfb next stitch, knit across gusset, kfb last stitch in round
4: repeat #5
5: repeat #6
6: repeat #7, after marker slip kfb next stitch, knit across gusset, kfb last stitch in round

8: repeat #9
9: repeat #10, after marker slip kfb next stitch, knit across gusset, kfb last stitch in round
10: repeat #11

26: repeat #2
27: repeat #3
28: repeat #4 after marker slip kfb next stitch, knit across gusset, kfb last stitch in round
29: repeat #5
30: repeat #6
31: repeat #7 after marker slip kfb next stitch, knit across gusset, kfb last stitch in round
32: repeat #8, slip gusset sts on waste yarn and cast on 6 sts in empty space
33: repeat #9
34: repeat #10
35: repeat #11, after marker slip, k2tog, k2tog last 2 stitches in round
36: repeat #12
37: repeat #1
38: repeat #2, after marker slip, k2tog, k2tog last 2 stitches in round
39: repeat #3
40: repeat #4
41: repeat #5, after marker slip, k2tog, k2tog last 2 stitches in round
42: repeat #6
43: repeat #7
44: repeat #8, after marker slip, k2tog, k2tog last 2 stitches in round
45: repeat #9
46: repeat #10
47: repeat #11, after marker slip, k2tog, k2tog last 2 stitches in round
48: repeat #12
49: repeat #1
50: repeat #2, after marker slip, k2tog, k2tog last 2 stitches in round

I have no idea if I'm doing this right. If any of you more experienced knitters could help me out on this, I would greatly appreciate your expertise! Also if you spot anything else in my "redone" pattern that looks a little wrong, feel free to let me know. It just seems like the whole gusset and actual body of the mitten would be so unproportional (lol is that a word even?)
