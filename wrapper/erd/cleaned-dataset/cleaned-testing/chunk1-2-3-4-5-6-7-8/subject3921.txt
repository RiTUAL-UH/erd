 I have study hall and I have nothing to play. 




 How'd you, Rob, and Charlie meet? How close are you guys? 




 I mean I think they would play really similar. It's not like they would have to change the whole way he played. But after they sorted out all the copyright issues then I think it would work. I don't expect it to happen I just think it would be cool and really fun. 




 I think this would be so cool being a huge god of war fan. I think it wouldn't be too difficult since they both have the same kind of weapons, just change the look. I don't know what others would think.  Just an idea.  




 Alright man I'll take into consideration what you said and I'll definitely apply it next time I play. Thanks a lot dude 




 This is awesome. Thanks dude and what do you think is the better matchup for Marth and Squirtle? R.O.B. or Sonic? 




 I main R.O.B. and Sonic and I need to figure out how to beat my friends mains. (Squirtle/Marth) 




 Self confidence man, self confidence  




 Haha what was her reaction? 




 Just curious to hear these. 




 My parents are divorced and are still friends, my mom recently started dating a black man (my family is all whites), my dad was over looking for a key to a car. Keep in mind my dad has NEVER made a vulgar joke around me. While talking about the key to the car she says,
"Yeah, it's big and black."

and so my dad says,

"Yeah, that's two things that are big and black." You can clearly see how butthurt my mom is.

Five minutes later he comes up to me and says "Daddy's clever, right?" and high fived me. I've never laughed so hard.  




 Dad: "Oh did you hear about that celebrity that stabbed her husband? It was Reese something..."

Me: "Witherspoon?"

Dad: "No, with her knife." 





























 I also have the newest one. Into the nexus. Is that okay if I do that? 




 Alright then, and I have the R C collection for ps3 that features Ratchet and Clank, Ratchet and Clank: Going Commando, and Ratchet and Clank: Up your arsenal. I no longer own a ps3. 




 Yes very much so!! I'm so sorry I didn't reply! Message me! 




 Thank you!!!! Someone not judgmental. Appreciate it. :) 




 Which ones do you have? Also have the newest one. Into the Nexus. I'd have to take another look but I'll keep you updated my man! 




 Like what? 




 I sold my ps3 but miss Ratchet and Clank too much. Thank you. 




 I watched first season and a little of second and not a lot caught my attention. Does it get a lot better? 




 I'm a new Chronos and I don't think that the build I'm using now is too good. Any long time Chronos players got a good build? 




 I fool you not sir, this was one of the smallest amazing thing I've ever seen. 









 I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit to post on. If it isn't give me the right one please but anyway. In January my family and I had discovered my sister had developed a nasty addiction to heroin and prescription pills. We sent her to rehab and she had gone for 4 months and she had just gotten out last week. The day she got out she relapsed, she started using cocaine. She had confessed to my parents and I. We had no clue what to do, so we started taking part in IOP (intensive out patient). She goes 3 times a week and gets tested, she has been passing but even so my parents have been super anxious, my parents are divorced. My dad does not show too much emotion but he does eat a lot of sugar and he has diabetes which is clearly not good for his health. My mom who I live with predominately has been pushing a lot of home renovations on herself and I. She said to me today "I rearrange furniture in my own house cause it is the only thing that I can control." I can't get it out of my head, it is just something that I thought was so deep. She does everything around the house and pushes way too much work on herself. My sister is in Vineland and then off to Woodbury if anyone knows where that is. I'm so anxious and so are my parents. Anything we can do you guys think we can do to calm our nerves? Thank you. 




 Damn I want that now 




 This is what's up. The name is awesome too.  




 I love Apollo he is hands down favorite character in game. There's just one thing he lacks. Skins. Anyone got some cool Apollo skin ideas? 
























 How about depending how much shipping is I'll pay it. I live in the New England area.  




 Another game I have you may be interested in is Transformers: the first Cybertron one. The case is a little messed up but the game itself works perfectly.  




 Nothing that may interest you. Cut really short on ps3 games ever since I sold it. Would you mind just coming to an agreement for just the collection? I apologize. 




 Do you like quality of game? And can I see your pictures? Plus another game I have NBA 2K13 if that means anything.  




 http://imgur.com/a/ijSxW here is the collection. I think into the nexus is currently in my friends possession if it cannot be found I'll list some other games that may peak your interest.  




 Yeah I have a character for each position that I'm decent at but I'm just really good at those guys. Thank you. 




 Hey guys, I'm about to start ranked play and was just wondering who gets banned. I play Odin which concerns me a little, but also play a lot of Apollo and Mercury. Thanks guys. 




 Classy response.  




 Okay thank you, man. For being understanding. I'll do it as soon as I can! 




 May I do it tomorrow? I'm off my computer and unfortunately cannot send the pictures from my phone. Does that sound okay? 




 I'm going to take the pictures of into the nexus right now.  




 It won't let me post it on gameswap. It says it only allows text posts. Is there another way I can successfully send you the picture?  




 I can't send the pictures through the comment but I will post them on gameswap and just go to my account to see them. Sorry for the inconvenience.

 




 Both really really nice. Will send pictures right now. Let me get them and send the pictures. May I ask you do the same? 




 Yes sir. 4 games total. 





























 They DID mention a new one coming down the line soon enough. It may not make you feel awesome but who cares? For me I'm repping my favorite smite team and youngbae is my favorite Apollo player he got me to play Apollo again after I stopped. So I'm damn well buying the skin and you don't have to I just thing that it's just a nice little change up. You don't HAVE to like it. You also don't HAVE to get the skin. 




 Maybe it doesn't fit your appeal. As a legendary Apollo I think it looks nice and may wait for gem drop BUT with the free gems you can win this weekend you may only have to pay for 400. I think it looks nice. 




 Confirmed! 




 Successful trade with MuseTheGreat. Ratchet and Clank: Going Commando, Ratchet and Clank: Up your Arsenal, and Ratchet: Deadlocked. Great guy! 




 League of Legends has it, Dota 2 has it, what about Smite? I know some may think that it could be a disadvantage; but I disagree. I mean, if you and another friend of yours want to join a ranked game and duo or just play together so you don't feel totally alone. Also, everybody else can do it as well. So pretty much everyone can get an advantage if they chose to play with someone. For me, it is more of just a comfort thing of knowing your friend is in the same game with you. Plus, you may work well with your friend if you two were to duo. It just discourages me because about 5 of my close friends all play smite and we constantly do premades, sieges, arenas, and assaults. Occasionally if someone isn't on we will play conquest. What do you guys think?  




 I was ranging from about 1990-now. 




 Really cannot agree more.  









 Did it 




 They all look really really good, and sadly, no. I will continue looking but the offer for the paid shipping is still up if its inconvenient for you. 




 Actually closer to Philadelphia. I guess I'm not too familiar with the map and regions haha.  




 Just someone with a funny design like Ymir, Kumba, Ne Zha, Bakasura, etc. 




 That's fine. I was aiming about ten or below. We'll discuss the shipping and stuff tomorrow but may I see the pictures? 





























 You, I like you. 




 Me and a few friends got into a conversation about weird middle names. We wanted to see a few! 




 No, I'm an Anus Explorer. It's not very official, it's kind of a getting paid under the table type job, you know? 




 Your username is shockingly relevant to my profession.  




 Requiem for a Dream. 




 Fuck, this was so beautiful. I love their relationship and the worst things always happened To Jesse. Thanks for showing me this...bitch. 









 These guys are awesome! Definitely the new favorite. Thanks so much dude its such a hassle finding a new band.  




 This is helpful, thanks very much. You kind of said everything I couldn't express myself. 




 I'm 15, and I really want to work at a produce stand/farm. My dad used to be a farmer and has connections to try to get me a job. If anyone has any experience working at a farm at a young age can you tell me what it is like? Is it worth it? 









 Your lack of legitimacy in your answer in attempts to be funny is very pathetic.  




 Chronos is the man but I will agree a fed enemy chronos makes you wanna punch a wall. 




 Wow, really surprised no one said Loki! I despise him and would pick him in a heartbeat, but I feel you guys. 


































 Also I think in his three he should say, "Have at you!" 














 Yeah probably, I think the month December should just be called "Deck." 




 He will do this thing where he gets you all worked up over something so when he said "HOLY FUCKING SHOTE" it indicated that something major had happened and it worked me up.  




 December, actually still not done yet.  









 Gravity bongs can be rough, dude. Great story haha glad you got out of it okay, man! 




 I think what did it was he was very tired he took a nap and he told us to wake him up when we were going out so that probably was what did it.  




 Last night, me and my friends were all at at one friends house. We were going to smoke when it got darker and his dad went to sleep. His dad finally crashed right around 3:30 maybe 3. When the time came me and four other people had left to walk about a half a mile down the street to go to the woods where this was an old barn. I had smoked there before so I was familiar and had known it was a safe but two of the three had not. At every single sound they would say "What the fuck was that? We need to get the fuck out of here." Me and the other friend would say "Relax its just the sound of the earth." We had really good weed and we had done about two bowls and the three of us were really stoned. Unfortunately, we had a friend who usually was fine to smoke with but this time out of nowhere he started wobbling very subtle. I had noticed but didn't think anything of it, but then he started to turn ghostly white and I started to get a little worried. He then started wobbling like crazy and just in a faint whisper he said "catch me". He fell and hit the back of his head on the solid ground and he just blacked out and were all screaming his name hoping for him to get up because we knew if he had passed out we would have to tell our friends dad and possibly go to the hospital. Fortunately, he had awoken within the next thirty seconds and we had one friend hold his hand and walked home and we had gotten back to his friends house and played super smash bros after our blackout friend had fallen asleep for the night. Although we had gotten away unscathed it truly was one of the scariest moments of my life. 




 That's a lot better! 




 Instead of him carrying around a harp he would carry around a banjo. He would have overalls and a straw hat. For his one instead of harp music it'd be a strum of a banjo. Also his mesmerize would just be like a yodel. Also instead of a chariot it'd be a lawnmower or tractor and when he would land he would say "YEE-HAW!"
  




 Pretty much. 




 Fantastic, but can't reveal much about the project. Sort of classified. 
























 What movie to watch: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, The Town, Gangs of New York, or A Clockwork Orange. 

Thanks guys. 




 Solobek. 




 Birdman. 




 Django Unchained, I hated myself for waiting so long but wow. That movie was absolutely superb and made me one thousand times more excited for Tarantino's "The Hateful Eight".   




 That's ambitious.  




 Hm. Worded it wrong. Know the girl, don't know the guy that interfered. 









 Paul Blart: Mall Cop 









 Enfeebling curse and greater sprint. 




 As a final item yes, it is imperative to late game and will help you out tremendously in team fights with your ult. 




 My build goes: 

Warrior Tabi
Executioner
Hide of the Urchin 
Witchblade 
Runeforged Hammer 
Qin Sais 

I think this is the perfect balance of defense, damage, and attack speed. It is important to have attack speed on Vamana because if you buy a creeping curse you can just simply obliterate your enemies. Then hide of the urchin corresponds with Vamana's passive so well, and Runeforged converts protection to damage which adds on to that. Hope this helped.
 




 I am all about jump parties in smite where people jump up and down before minions spawn, it is just so fun and makes the game more fun. Nothing makes me more mad then when people are jumping and some asshole comes in gun's a blazing and initiates a fight, leading to betrayal and hatred. Please, respect the jump party...do not be THAT guy. 


































 Pulp Fiction. 




 American History X 




 Pulp Fiction: "Bring out the gimp" 




 Additional question: Have any of you seen "The Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea"? If so, is that worth a watch? 




 Thanks! Never considered The Abyss, love James Cameron though. Will definitely add to the list! 




 Excluding Jaws, I have not seen or heard of any good underwater thrillers. Do you guys know of any? (Documentaries about the ocean are welcome). 




 I love him in Horrible Bosses, along with the rest of the trio. He is a very loveable guy and can't imagine hating him in any role. 




 "If this doesn't work out for you, you fuck off back to your studio palace and dive back into that cultural genocide you guys are perpetrating. You know, a douche bag is born every minute, that was P.T. Barnum's premise when he invented the circus, and nothing much has changed, and you guys know that if you crank out any toxic piece of crap, people will line up and pay to see it, but long after your gone, I'm gonna be on that stage, earning my living, bearing my soul, wrestling with real complex human emotions!" -Mike Shiner(Edward Norton), Birdman (or the unexpected virtue of ignorance) 




 Don't believe I could conjure up a top 10, but my top 5 would be:

1. Guardians of the Galaxy
2. The Dark Knight 
3. Iron Man
4. The Avengers 
5. Captain America: The Winter Soldier 




 Forrest Gump, no doubt. He is one of my favorite movie characters of all time and seems like the guy who'd be with you through thick and thin.  




 I agree, Rogen has sort of cornered himself in comedy. I would love to see him become like Jonah Hill and show off some dramatic acting chops. Obviously they saw something to cast him in the movie, I have great faith. My guess he will be much better than Gad, but I'm pretty sure they were just shooting for look-alikes. 




 Landed on Gangs,and I am very much a movie enthusiast. I absolutely adore and appreciate great acting and creative direction, loved Gangs. 




 Oh don't worry I watched the first five minutes with my great aunt Dot. Had to turn it off immediately and was not really feeling it, landed on Gangs. Absolutely loved it. 




 Thank you, I was strongly considering Clockwork. I appreciate the input. 




 I have not.
