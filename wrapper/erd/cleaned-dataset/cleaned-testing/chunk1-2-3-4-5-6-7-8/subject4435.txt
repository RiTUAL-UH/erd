 She hasn't been exsanguinated nor given Digitalis. Hopefully she'll be alright and this has nothing to do with the Eve's. 




 I'd certainly read more!  




 That's awful. I'm so sorry you had to go through that. Thanks for sharing with us, OP, and I hope things have changed for the better for you. 




 Tell your brother the truth. Tell him about the picture, the woman in the kitchen, remind him of the heavy breathing. All of it. It isn't fair for him to think he's crazy when you know the truth. 




 Thanks for clarifying that.

Can I ask though, now that it's done, have you got any clarity as to why you did it? 
 




 Is the mark in the same place your wife's cancer started? Did she lose her hair during treatment? 




 You ok OP?

 My mom does that too. 

She'd dump out my cup of freshly made tea and put the cup in the sink, then complain about how many dishes I've left, or take all my shower stuff out of the basket I have in there, and replace it with hers, then act oblivious when I ask where my stuff is. The best though is when she takes a bag of my laundry to wash with hers when I'm busy, and then SWEARS she can't find any of the items that were in that bag. Which I then find in her room. My whole life has been spent looking for my stuff she refuses to admit she moved/lost. 




 Was she.... your sister? What?  




 Nosleep = crack. Even when I want to stop, I can't. 




 I'm sad this was removed!

But on a better note, I won this game this morning! Had a hair elastic in my hand while sitting in bed, don't remember setting it down, found it underneath my pillow! 

Edit: Did you change the clock on my stove? I reset it after a power outage and the next day it was 11 minutes off.
Second edit: 3:49 am. Have lost my cellphone 3 times now, twice found in bed, once in bathroom. Bunch of Chrome tabs I don't remember opening. I promise to never notice you again. 




 North Wales Hospital right? I've read about it. Are you alright?
Did you get into the burned out bits or just the stuff where they were trying to convert it to apartments? (Stupid plan, eh?)  




 Upvoted cause my black lab named Abigail and I are seriously curious about this. 




 I... don't think so. I feel like an idiot having done this but all the randomly capitalized words ends up being: ssmrtwdmhwhhttiiattttoatfohotujoto. Which I think is nonsense. 




 What? 




 This is seriously my favorite thing on the internet. 




 Just a suggestion, please format the conversations a bit better. I want to read it but I can't follow the huge block of text. :) 




 I think something is up but I can't place exactly what it is, it's just a feeling plus Steph being M.I.A. The dog I have no explanation for. It's only when we put Jake in his room though. Not any other time.  




 No worries friend. I've got a grown man snoring on one side of me, Jake is asleep on the other side with every blanket on the bed on top of him, and the dog is on my feet. I've had to read my replies 3 or 4 times to check for typos, EVERY time. I think we may go stay at my dad's for a bit. He lives out of the city in a pretty quiet spot (thankfully with wifi.) I've got a few days off coming soon and Win has some vacation time still.  




 Hey folks. I wasn't sure where to post this but figured here was a good start. 

Suffice it to say, my son is 7 going on 8 and he has been through a traumatic event. Could this be causing him to regress in certain aspects but not others?

We practiced extended breastfeeding and he weaned at around 3.5, with the odd nightmare or stomach bug bringing him back to wanting to nurse up until about 5. He's an articulate kid so he understands why I'm  not allowing it now and he can communicate his desire although not necessarily his reasons. 

I'm just wondering if any other EBF mom out there has dealt with something similar, and what you'd suggest I do in this situation. 
Thanks in advance. 




 Ah okay I get where you were going with that. But no, poor guy just seems to have shit luck. I had one miscarriage before Jake, his next girlfriend had one and left him shortly after, and Steph's had two previous to this pregnancy.  




 Something IS off. 
I wish I could put my finger on it so I could describe how it feels here or all of /nosleep could just be here for a day to feel it. 

Like Win even brings Jake to see me when I'm working because it's this tight chest can't focus kind of desperation and general wrongness. Left over anxiety maybe? 


As for Win being involved... He has the kindest and gentlest soul I've ever met. He loves Jake and I so much and he is such a genuinely good man. I trust him as much as I trust myself. I can say with certainty that he isn't involved. His only flaw here may have been withdrawing from Steph the way he did, to be with Jake and I. 




 Not much but a small update added. 




 Tiny update added. 




 Op deleted their account, what do we do now? 




 Update us again soon Op! Stay safe. 




 If I went into my mom's room upset about knocking in the middle of the night, she'd tell me it was gas and yell at me for waking her up. Stuff like this is like 90% of the reason I got a dog.  




 Your writing is beautiful OP. I'll be checking for updates! 




 Oh. My. God. I was picturing Animal from the Muppets the whole time I was reading. Lol. 




 I was picturing Animal from The Muppets. 




 I haven't got much reason to suspect her but I feel the same way. What if A: She was involved or B: Something happened to her. But at the same time, she told Win she was pregnant and then he moved in with me cause our kid was missing. I would be peeved too. Either way though Win is trying to get in touch with her family to see if they know where she is. I'll update this post when/if I know more.

 Hey nosleepers! Sorry this has taken so long. A lot of things have happened.

Jake, Win, and myself, are home and healthy and safe. We had a few cops hanging around for a while but it's all finished now.


The security guard from the hospital? He took Jake. He left the box of things for us to find. He came into our home while we were gone and took those things back after a set amount of time. I only got to keep the key card because I had Jake's keys with me when he came here. He did the same to the families of every woman we found in that room, only they came alone. I would have ended up as his next victim had I not brought Win with me.

He would take the child, keeping them alive and well, dragging them around with him as he planted clues, and then he would sedate them when the mother got close enough to find them in the room. If the mother came alone, he would sedate her, kill the child, and move on to the next victim. He was looking for someone to win his game. I guess he was looking for me.

According to the police, his home was full of pictures of me. Some taken from my Facebook page, some he took himself from short distances while I was out or working, dating back to the time I was volunteering at the hospital. It seems I was his end target. He had deemed me smart enough to win.

The hospital has been shut down now, the guard is being held in a secure wing at the forensic hospital, and my life is going back to normal.  No one has heard from Steph, her things are gone from the apartment she shared with Win, her phone is disconnected, and were moving on. Win, Jake, and I, are going to be a family like we should have been. None of us can stand being apart. As Im typing this, Win is sitting on one side of me, Jake is asleep with his head on my shoulder, and the dog is asleep on him.

Everything is going to be okay. I just wish we could find Steph.


Update: (I know I said this was final.)
___________________________________________________________________________________________

I just wanted to let everyone know Jake is doing great being home with us. He doesn't even really seem freaked out about what happened. He says he knew we'd find him, just like I knew he was okay. I swear this kid and I have some sort of telepathic link. #momproblems. Win hardly leaves our side. We've decided to keep Jake out of school for a bit until things calm down so I'm down to part time hours at work and I'm homeschooling him. All three of us sleep in my bed every night with the dog. We tried putting Jake in his own room last night but no one could sleep and the dog wouldn't stop freaking out so we brought him back in with us and everything was fine

On the Steph front, there hasn't really been much. Win has been in touch with her parents but they haven't heard from her since Jake went missing. Her phone rings straight to voicemail. I thought I saw her walking by across the street from my work the other day. I was out smoking on the front stoop at sunset, which is of course the least conducive time visibility wise, but I would have sworn it was her. I yelled her name a few times but she didn't look up. I guess it wasn't her.

Win has thrown himself into being Jake's dad and being here for me. I know he's still shaken from Jake being missing and I know he's terrified something's happened to Steph and the baby. A lot of the pregnancies Win creates seem to end in miscarriage. There are just a lot more questions than answers right now.

I'll keep updating this post until I run out of space.

 




 I'm Canadian! Born and raised. 




 No idea! The redditors don't like me. :(
I added the second update to the third one and the final one will be up in a few days!

 Sorry for losing you with this one. The update has been located and added to this one to make reading it easier. The post keeps getting taken down. 




 I had a hard time getting that one to stay up so I added it to this one. 




 Stay safe OP. Bottled water for a while and be mindful of what you eat. Keep us updated! 




 First Update: 

After spending nearly half the day yesterday between the ear drum shattering roar of Wins straight-piped Integra, and telling people over and over about my missing child and begging them to put up his missing posters, Im exhausted but somehow still too wired for sleep. We didn't find anything new. The map is missing. I swear I had it in my wallet and now it's gone. I'm sure I set it down somewhere and forgot it.
As with most missing posters, a phone number, mine to be specific, is on the bottom of the poster we've been putting up, asking people to call us if they have any information. I've had a few prank calls, a few well-wishers, and way too many false sightings. But tonight I had a different kind of call. Tonight a man who said he was a security guard at the mental hospital left me a message telling me he could help me. My phone didn't ring, but somehow between checking it at Tim Hortons and checking it again about 15 minutes later at home, Id had a call.
Now, this hospital is nearly abandoned. I mean there might be 50 patients left, all long term residents with nowhere else to go, no doctors on staff, nurses and CCAs take care of the daily work and a Doc visits once a week. I used to volunteer there a few years ago, reading books to patients. I dont remember this particular security guard but I was only there for a few hours a week so thats not all that strange is it? Anyway his message said to give him a call at 5am when hes on break so thats what Im going to do.
On the way home earlier I had thought the radio was talking about missing kids in town but after frantically fumbling at the volume knob and nearly knocking the car into neutral, it turns out theres a fourth woman gone missing. The newest one, Catie Millier, is an old school friend and her son is about Jakes age. Sad. I hope they find her. The last one turned up dead in New Brunswick.
I got up at 4:45 so I could be awake to call the guard at 5. I was sitting downstairs at the kitchen table drinking tea and smoking when Win, looking rather disheveled, stumbled in and sat across from me. I dialed the guards number and put the phone on speaker so we could both hear. His name is Tim, and from what I gather he remembers me from the days I volunteered there. He asked if we had found anything Jake might have left behnd, like clues or anything, which I thought was a bit odd. We told him that yes, we had found a few things but were having a hard time making sense of them. It wasn't until he asked what Jake had left behind that I really got concerned. I guess you could say my "spidey senses" were tingling. I really just wanted to end the conversation there because I wasn't sure how this man though he could help us, of ir he had just wanted to snoop, or if he knew something he wasn't saying. Win got mad though and started cursing at this guy. I shushed him and leaned closer to the phone. Tim had gone silent and in the background over the hiss of the line, I could hear a loud speaker. Code White. All staff report to central desk. Patient Miller armed and considered dangerous. The line abruptly went dead and we were left stunned in the deafening silence of the kitchen. Patient Miller. Its an awfully big coincidence that she just went missing and I heard her last name during that phone call. I wonder
Win has decided were going there tomorrow (today now I guess. We haven't slept.) Sunday is the day all the family members visit so we're hoping to blend into the small crowd. Hopefully security lets us in with no trouble but if not, I still have my pass card and hopefully my alarm code is still the same. We need to find out whats happening there.
I still haven't figured out how to add pictures but since the map is missing anyway I guess it doesn't matter. I've asked around a bit and the key is almost certainly for a pad lock. No one knows what the pass card is for but it seems like a logo has been filed off somehow. Almost in the size and shape of the logo on my pass card for the hospital.
My dog has been barking out my bedroom window for about an hour now. She stops for a few minutes at a time but keeps growling. We've gone outside and looked around but don't see anything. The house is locked up tight and we're all safe and sound in here.
I'll update more as soon as I can. We're going to check out the hospital after work.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Second Update:


We got into the hospital. 


My pass card still worked and my alarm code was the same. We got in no problem. We searched around for a while and couldn't find any staff and all of the patients were locked in their rooms for the night. I wanted to explore but needed someone to watch my back so Win set up shop in the empty security booth to keep watch over the cameras. Before I set out I grabbed a flashlight from the desk and called him on my cellphone so we could keep in constant contact. 


The hospital itself seemed exactly the way I left it, except deserted. Only one of four wards was currently in use and housed all of the current residents. Charts were stacked neatly, chairs were pushed in, it seemed like everyone had just left for the night. None of the patient rooms had names on them, just numbers, so there were no answers about Catie Miller from that. I figured Id keep looking and come back to check out the charts later. I checked every room, jiggling the door handle and shining the flashlight in the small windows to see which rooms had patients. This whole time I had Win in my ear asking questions and letting me know I was alone. The hallway I was in seemed to go on forever. The way the hospital is set up is the main hub, with a corridor running off of each of the four sides. Three of them were shut with large steel doors, chained and padlocked. 


I kept walking down the hallway I was in, expecting to hit a dead end, but instead I ran into a pair of steel doors just like the ones closing off the other wards. Only these ones were propped open with door stops. Behind them lay a few more feet of corridor, and what looked like a pair of elevator doors. I looked for buttons but couldn't find any, so I pulled the flat head screwdriver out of the bag slung across my shoulder and pried the damn doors open. 


The walls in this corridor were disgusting. They were brown and damp looking with veins of black running from floor to ceiling. The lights were dim and flickering and the smell was unbelievable. Win let me know I had gone past the last camera and I was walking blind. I told him to head my way since the ward was empty and it seemed safer now for us to be together. I walked back out of this weird hallway and waited by the elevator type doors until he arrived. I hadn't realized how anxious I was until he came into view but I practically flying-squirreled him out of excitement to see him. 


Together we walked back into the hallway and started looking around. There were bits of paper on the floor here and there and we could hear a steady hum, barely audible over our own breathing. Following the hum led us around a corner to a set of sliding doors like youd imagine for a quarantine section. My pass card wouldn't work but the card from Jake's keys opened them. We weren't prepared for what we found behind them. It looked like the morgue. A row of steel tables ran the length of the room and our breath could be seen in the air. 


On the tables lay a row of women, seemingly naked, and covered from chest to knees by a neatly folded sheet. The closest to the door was a very familiar face. It was Catie. I walked cautiously over to her and checked her pulse, which thankfully she still had. That was when I noticed each woman was connected to an IV. Whoever put them here was keeping them sedated and alive. For what?


We checked each womans pulse, and each was colder than the last, her heart beating a little bit slower, but every last one was still alive. Win went over to check the rows of doors for body storage and in each of the 9 drawers there was a child, male and female, around the same age, none of them with a pulse. One child for each woman in the room. Turning away from the gruesome sight I realized there was one table left, the figure on it covered entirely by a sheet. The IV was still running so we pulled down the sheet and I hit the floor. My son, my Jake, laying on that metal table in that room with all those women. And that was when I realized it. 

All of the women on that table looked like me. Dark hair, dark eyes, short, thick around the middle. We had similar features, seemed to be around the same age.


Jake was alive. He still had a pulse. Win dialed 911 while I held Jakes hand and sobbed into his sweater. All of the children in the drawers were naked but he was still fully clothed, wearing that sweater. It was mine when I got pregnant and he had claimed it a few years ago. It was still huge on him but the kid loved it because it had my name on the sleeve.

 
Win says it was only about 15 minutes but it seemed like a week before the police and paramedics showed up. Teams and teams of them. The coroner arrived shortly after but we didnt get to speak with him as Jake had been given something to wake him up and he was starting to come around. We left in the ambulance with him and were currently at the hospital. Jake is frail and thin and the poor kid is so pale but hes happy to see us and hes eating jello and we have officers outside the room keeping us safe.  Win just came back in from giving his statement and now its my turn. Ill update as soon as I can.
 




 I agree with the salt. Do the doorways and windows, and maybe a circle around your bed. 

Have you thought of doing what it says? Just... going up north? I'm sure us nosleep-ers would have your back! 




 Could you take a sample of the water to have it tested independently? Do you have a meal hall on campus, could it be food poisoning? Does your roommate have any chronic health issues? It could be a virus attacking those who are susceptible?
Edit: Could it be lead poisoning? The article says the building was built is the 20's. 




 http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2gcei5/jake_update/
Just a little update and some strange goings-on. I'll add more as soon as there is more. Thanks for your well wishes. 




 I'll add photos as soon as I figure out how. I feel like we're missing something obvious. I think the key is for a padlock but there isn't a lock in the entire house. I'm back to work this weekend but will update as often as possible. 




 No one at the school seems to remember him leaving. Everyone's response is the same. "His dad picked him up for a doctor's appointment. Expect him home later this evening." It's almost like it's scripted, like they have no other information on it. The police have no where to turn. There are no leads, no evidence, Jake's just... gone. Disappeared. I haven't figured out the stuff in the box yet but we're trying. He's such a smart kid, I know he left us something, I feel like I'm missing it. I'll update as soon as I know more. 




 Original was taken down as an intro. Adding the update here. Hopefully it stays up.

I suppose I should start this off by giving you a little bit of background so that things Ill mention further into my story will make sense. Here goes.

My name is Sarah, Im 23, and my 7 year old sons name is Jake, Yes that means I had him at 16. I was raised by a mechanic and a seamstress so resourceful and scrappy are second nature along with being just a little bit wild, hence being a teen mom.

I had never really put much thought into sharing my story but recently my cousin Diane mentioned r/nosleep  and after lurking here for a while I thought you all might be able to offer some advice or at least some support. Let me cut to the chase. My son has been missing for about 2 months. 2 weeks ago, they called off the search.

I work as a nanny and when Im at work, Jake hangs out with my mom. We all live together in a townhouse with a handful of cats and a dog who thinks shes a cat. We have a good and calm life and aside from scaring the shit out of myself on a regular basis with gore and horror, nothing eventful happens. I work, Mom works, Jake goes to school. Hes one of the smartest kids I've ever met. He loves to read and draw and he can make music with just about anything. His bedroom is right next to mine.

I hadn't seen Mom or Jake for about 2 days, which sounds terrible but because I work night shifts, Mom works days, and Jake is in school, we can pass like three ships in the night for a few days at a time. I got in around 8:30am, crawled into bed with my dog, and passed out like it was a normal day, but let me tell you, it wasn't. I woke up startled and uncomfortably sweaty around 4:30pm to my dog barking frantically at my bedroom door, hopping up and down trying to get out to see my Mom who was in the bathroom across the hall. I let her out and followed her, rubbing sleep from my eyes, and adjusting my shirt so that nothing was hanging out. (Im a rough sleeper.) Mom opened the bathroom door to greet us and I could tell something wasn't right. She explained to me that when she had gone to pick Jake up from school, she was informed that his father had picked him up for a doctors appointment at around noon and that we should expect him to be dropped off to us later in the evening.  That wasn't all that strange, Win picks Jake up all the time, but usually he tells us first, and Jake didn't have a doctors appointment. Mom had tried calling Win from the car but had no luck so after I tried a few times, I gave his fiance Steph a call.

Steph: Hey Sarah, how are things? Hows Jake?
Me:  Hey Steph, thats why Im calling. Jakes school told us that Win picked him up this afternoon. Its totally cool if he did, god knows the kid could use an afternoon off, its just that he didn't tell me so Im worried.
Steph: Sarah I dont really want to be the one to say this, but Win and I have been home together all day. I was sick this morning and he called off work so we could just hang out. Im going to explain to him whats going on and well be right over okay?
Me: Okay Steph. Dont let him drive. The last thing we need is you guys getting hurt.

By this time I had started to panic a little. Mom was watching me, still standing in the bathroom doorway, and I slid down the hallway wall into a seated position. I waved my hands at her and stared blankly and thankfully the poor woman understood I needed a cigarette.  She sat down across from we and we just sat there staring blankly til the dog ran down the stairs to greet Steph and Win.
They yelled Hey! while trudging up the stairs, the dog trying her best to herd them. Shes a half-assed Border Collie. Steph sat down with us and Win stepped over mom and I in the hallway and opened Jakes bedroom door. It looked exactly as it had 2 days before when I tucked him in. The bed was rumpled, books under and on top of the covers, a precarious pile of even more books with a water glass on top stacked beside the bed. His window was open a crack, which seemed strange, but I couldn't really place why. I got up and followed Win in, putting my arm around his back and feeling comforted when he wrapped his arm around my shoulders in response. Together we rifled through all of Jakes books, flipped pages and lifting dust jackets, finding nothing. A final scan of the room showed one lone book sitting atop his dresser, nearly falling of the edge. It wasn't really a book but one of those magnetic boxes that look just like a book. Inside was a set of keys, what looked like a map obviously drawn by Jake, and a framed photo of Win, Jake, and I. 

We called the police. I had a feeling we were making a mistake, involving them wouldn't end well, but everyone else insisted so I gave in. Two officers came and checked out the house, gave Jakes room a once over, (at least my family let me hide the book-box just in case they wanted to take it,) and before they left I asked them to dust and fingerprint the window frame and sill. They treated me like I was crazy, because were on the second floor, but they did it because mom and I swore the window had been closed. The cops left to talk to a few people at Jakes school and file the report for us and that was the most action they ever took. A month and a half and no leads later, after questioning and accusing everyone I hold dear, including myself, multiple times, the search was called off and the case was deemed cold.

Win and Steph had been living with us by then, alternating sleeping on the couch and on an air mattress in my room with me. Steph's sick was actually morning sickness that was very nearly killing her, and the history between Win and I was beginning to cause some tension. The day the case was declared cold, Steph walked out on Win and seldom returns his calls. He started sleeping in my bed. Nothing happened. We didnt even cuddle. But being apart made us both anxious so we were sticking together. We still are. 

This is way too long and wordy for one post. I just wanted to give background. I'll add more tomorrow.
___________________________________________________________________________________________

[UPDATE]

Win and I havent left each others sides. We do everything together. Last night we drank some wine and had a look at Jakes map again. It seems like to starts at our house, and takes us to the mental hospital by the community college campus, in sort of a 7 year old round about fashion. I dont know if he was confused, trying to confuse us, or trying to confuse whoever was watching him draw it. I can only tell because he used the same symbols Ive been teaching him since he started school. # is always home. I used to draw it on city maps and in his school agendas so he would always know that if he was lost, that was home. The ferry terminal, ~ (waves,) the school, ^ (dunce caps, he doesnt get this one but it makes me laugh,) and the two hospitals nearly across from one another, + (EMERG) and +  (Mental Hospital.) The map seems like its meant to go on but he was stopped short of finishing it. The keys are his, but with two additions. The first is a tiny brass key like youd use for a padlock, the second is one of those little keychain cards, like a store loyalty program, only its completely white with only the scan strip on the back. Ill admit we were a few sheets to the wind when we discovered what the map meant. Perhaps thats why it came to me so easily, who knows. After a particularly energetic round of the bed-spins, I was trying to steady myself, sitting against the footboard toying with the framed photo of Jake, Win, and I, flipping it over and over in my hands to distract myself. As I turned it back and forth I began to notice that the frame and the back were not entirely attached anymore. As if someone had separated the front metal frame from the velvet covered cardboard backing. Win had been rolling back and forth across the bed for a while but when he saw me slip my thumbnail into the space between the frame and the back he sat bolt upright. He leaned over and peered into the space as I used my nails to pry the gap apart. I expected to find nothing and boy was I shocked when I noticed the piece of paper wedged in there. We pulled it out and unfolded it and in Jakes carefully practiced, uneven lettering, it said I am Taken. Mom Hide. We mulled that over for a while and came up with nothing, eventually passing out on top of the covers, fully clothed. So this morning Im sitting here writing this, nursing a horrendous wine hangover, and attempting to eat the greasy fried egg Win swears will fix it. Were going out today to put up some posters and talk to some people. SOMEONE must know where my child is and Im gonna find them. Ill update when we get home if theres any information. 
























 We're still here and the account is still active.
Probably not for long.
I wish he had listened. Next time one of these is posted I'll make sure to take screen caps. 




 See? Thank you. Tell this guy to listen!  




 Jesus Jumpin'. If your dumb ass gets killed because you didn't listen to the one person who knows what's coming, then I 110% support evolutionary theory 'cause that shit will be a prime example of survival of the fittest. 




 Shit. Okay. Eventually she's going to threaten you if you don't keep typing. She won't speak to you she'll just be reading over your shoulder. Warren called her Mel but I guess maybe he misheard her. Either way you need to get the hell out of there now. 




 Sure looks like it.  




 Yeah THAT'S what you should get from that... Warren was her date last night. She made him make the same post and the general consensus says she killed him, posted a few comments, and then deleted the account. 




 Okay dude seriously. Get out of where you are. Her name is Mel or something right? She's reading over your shoulder, right? Our questions, everything you type? Get a move on. Get out. Or you're going to end up like Warren. 




 I've only seen one more, but they're real! You didn't imagine them. 




 http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2jhj7r/hi_my_name_is_warren_ask_me_anything/ Deleted now but it was an identical post. Last night. His name was Warren.  




 Ask her about Warren and get your affairs in order. Don't drink the beer. 




 No... she chose to be an ex when the new shiny girl-toy was more interesting than her fiancee (me) was...
Loon calls are also creepy as hell. I've heard some odd stuff I couldn't place especially when I lived in the woods. Owls sound like a woman being murdered.  




 Has there been any news? 




 I can't find it! I can't for the life of me remember what it was called. Something about someone working late and there being an odd customer or something and then she ends up in the walk in fridge/freezer and then the thing woman whatever took her cellphone and made another post I think. 




 Well it's raining and I have a cold of some sort but otherwise I'm great. And yourself? 




 wat? 




 Ugh. I smoke out my bedroom window at night so I don't have to go outside and now I'm too creeped out. 




 I assumed the handprints were relevant.  




 I second the fox theory. I seriously woke up in the middle of the night and made my ex go out with a flashlight because it sounded exactly like a screaming newborn and I couldn't rationalize the noise. I was also terrified (thanks nosleep.) It was a fox standing in the middle of the road in front of my house making the noise.  




 Hey people who know about doppelgangers! Is it odd for your doppelganger to do things you do, including dating your significant other's doppelganger? I dated a woman for a few years after my son's father and I broke up and we would hear at least twice a week that we had just been wherever we were, or someone had seen us around town while we were actually on vacation, etc. 




 She's probably gonna kill you. Like that one who ate the girl in the freezer and posted from her cellphone. Nosleep Butler, any help there? 




 Where would you suggest we don't dig at? 




 The flower smell makes me think possession. Any family curses or deals with demons we should know about? 




 Read the sidebar, punk. 




 Says one comment but see no comment? Confused.
Don't answer or answer with "City Morgue, you whack'em we pack'em" or something equally silly. Could also call your phone provider from a different line and see if there's something up on their end. 




 I totally agree with the things with emotional significance keeping you safe. When I was a kid a lot of strange stuff happened to/around me. My parents got me a dog after my grandfather asked who I was playing with, while I was playing alone in the yard. They won't admit that's why they got her, of course. But I had her for 18 years and when she passed away we had her cremated so she could continue to keep me safe. My room (where her ashes are) is still the safest one in the house. 




 The anniversary could easily be a stresser for him, causing him to act out of character especially since he wouldn't know exactly what to do with his feelings. Hopefully the doctor's visit shed some light on what's happening. Stay safe OP, and stay strong for your brother. Please keep us updated. 




 OP if your brother has a regular doctor, I'd contact them and have him seen asap. Something may have scared him and he can't deal with it properly or something. My only experience with autism is my 4 year old nephew so the traits may manifest differently with age, but I know when Evvy is confused or can't process something, he acts VERY strange and sometimes creepy. 




 Removed cause it's an intro now that I've come back to comment. Update us Op? 




 I need to know how this turned out! It just.. died off. 




 Hey OP! Update? 




 Me too! What was that about? 




 Am I the only one calling bullshit on the parents reason for moving? They're looking for/running from something. And the date nights are suspicious. And the protecting you and someone yelling "wrong one" right before your parents came in your room, OP. I'm betting your parents know who took your brother and why. 




 Read this as "Call the poop!" I shouldn't be on here when I'm that tired. 




 Parent to parent, I'm sorry you're dealing with this. I think you may be eating your daughter in the casserole. You should check out/have the cops check out your neighbors. 




 Dude. Don't hurt /nosleep. Those of us who hang out here take it seriously and we're not hurting anyone else on Reddit by lurking on our own sub. If you don't like it, don't read it. Simple as. 

As for your hacker, I'd suggest forgetting your quest to make a bunch of people who deal with demons and stalkers and ghosts, hate you, and you should be pretty safe. 




 Do the missing letters here and there mean anything?
Edit: Too much nosleep. Disregard the question. 




 Read the title, started singing Barrett's Privateers. "I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier, the last of Barrett's Privateers!!" 




 Thanks for clarifying! 




 I'd call you a cunt but you don't have the warmth or the depth. Bugger off and leave us with our psychopathy in peace. :) 




 Take it to your neighbor like he said and wash your hands of the situation! 




 Maybe yes but maybe no. Don't put too much pressure on her to tell you the truth right now, as that may push her further away, if you know what I mean. But also if you feel you need to know, and she's behaving differently, then I'd suggest continuing to ask her gently. 




 Yes please! Tell us all the things! 




 Or there was a bike gang of monsters who interrupted them? 




 I need to know more! What has happened since? 




 I'm excited for this to be continued! I have a bunch of those closets in my house. The only one that has a handle on the inside is the one in my bedroom. 




 So wait. We think Gabe did something awful to her? 




 But Johnny and shotguns! I second the southern accent. 




 Why removed?! 
























 You doin' ok OP? Any news for us? 




 How can we help? 




 You could just add it to this one to avoid the post ban. I had to do that a couple times when I posted about my son. 




 Maybe you're just an asshole? 




 I... I think you're dead. I don't know how you're posting on nosleep but the crying, the being ignored like you're not there, etc. Were you in any kind of accident or did anything strange happen? Any missing time?  




 Yeah... I know we're supposed to believe this stuff but... 




 Creepy but won't scar you for life. Promise. 




 It is SO not your fault. Accidents happen. You didn't do anything wrong. Also, I'm sorry you're having a hard time with your transition. It's this awful cycle where being in the wrong body makes you depressed and being depressed makes you unsuitable for T and surgery, which makes you more depressed, etc. I hope you hang in there OP. Feel free to PM me if you wanna talk. I have a little experience. Not in the dead guy department but in the trans department. 




 What did it say?! Why isn't she feeling well? 




 Don't jump OP. You're safe now. 




 I had this theory but I haven't been able to figure it out myself. Op's username spelled on the keyboard of a phone could spell KNOCK with an extra letter. Op sent me : 42764440. I don't know if I'm patient enough to figure out what all the numbers could mean but maybe if it's a group effort?
Edit - for this cipher to work, the 1's don't mean anything.  




 Is it possible you watched something that happened in the past play out again? What is the history of the building? 




 Kaskistentie, Finland? 




 I'm seriously gonna need to watch Preppers. Everyone keeps talking about it.  




 Your username. 




 Stop panicking. You're going to be okay you just have to stay calm and be logical. Make a list of things you need: food, water, etc. Then make a list of ways to get those things. You're alone there so what about taking what you need and keeping track of it so you can repay it? That would ease your conscience. Better yet if the store computer systems are working, scan your items, go through the process on screen, and print yourself a receipt. As for fuel for your car, there are tanks underground in the parking lot of most gas stations. They're covered by manhole covers which you can lift and drop a bucket into the tank to get fuel. It's easier than siphoning. 

Edit: PM me if you need someone to talk to/more advice. I'm always here.

Edit 2: Go to a camping or sports store or even some hardware type of place and get a wind up flashlight with electrical outlets on it. You can wind the handle to charge your phone in case of loss of electricity. This is a must and needs to be done asap so you can keep in contact. 




 If you can get to a gas station, you can lift the covers and drop a bucket into the underground tanks. They all have access covers so they can do dips to check the level in the holding tank. Usually on a far side of the parking lot without a lot of parking spaces around it. It's easier than siphoning but be careful of sparks or any source of ignition. 




 Keep in touch with the meatball guy and hang tough. It's gonna be okay. Find something to eat, try not to drink too much alcohol. Post a link to this story in the comments of the other one so we can keep of track of both.  




 Writing was good but I'm left very confused. 




 I thought I was the only one who still said stay frosty. 




 Upvote for relevant username/comment. Hand with claws, [TALON]company91 suggests other side of story. I read too much. Sorry. Still upvoting though because I talk too much. 




 I've eaten four gaviscon foam tab thingies in the last hour because of my incredible heartburn. Why the hell did I read this? 




 Please keep us updated with anything new OP! I don't think you're in any danger right now though. 




 Burn it. Burn it asap. Then salt the ashes. 




 Any news on your situation? If you're experiencing something similar you should post it/keep us updated so we can try to help. 




 Any news on your situation? 




 We only have to believe OP's stuff. Not random commenters with obviously fake stuff! 




 I wish. I can't wait much longer. 




 Chill out. They just meant that a lot of us just skim the "New" page and read the titles that stand out to us. That's all. No one is ignoring you and it's not that we don't care about your wife's welfare. We do. We just don't all see posts all the time. There's an online database of medical professionals who are lifestyle-friendly. Check out fetlife.com groups. Someone can ALWAYS help. Maybe you both should talk to someone. Good luck. I hope everything turns out okay. 




 What about telling us in some sort of coded message? Nosleepers are awesome at codes. Or even giving us the name of a piece of your art we could google to find your name and then go from there? Something not direct, something that may not work, ya know? I think anything is worth a shot at this point. Good luck OP. Stay safe. 




 So no mold then? :( 




 Oh. My. God. I haven't seen gibberish like that since the mold! And the title... ROT 13. No way.  




 Thank you! I knew there was something there! 




 In this vein I've also heard that sterling silver can help ward things off. Sterling jewelry is usually quite inexpensive and readily available. I can't speak to it's efficacy though, it's just something I've heard. 




 I actually agree with you 100%. My son is 7 and even for being really smart and witty, the kid just can not lie to me. He has said things a few times that I've had a hard time believing but he's almost always right about whatever it was. 

OP, I believe your daughter. Don't push about the mug. Ask her if her friends took the pictures, how she met them, when she sees them, etc. Maybe also don't leave the younger daughter alone with her for a little while, just in case. Not because she'll hurt her but because the friends might. 




 In fear of having weird stuff start happening to me, I'm too interested to not help.
The numbers. Has anyone looked at their cell phone lately? 5 (JKL) 6 (MNO) 1 is blank so a space I assume, and 2 (ABC).
Can anyone make a word or three words I guess out of those letters? Even if it's just a sound or something?

Edit: More thoughts.
The number is an OCLC number in the worldcat.org library system. It's for a mircofilm. I'm gonna include a link just in case Cymon and Iphigenia is somehow relevant. http://www.worldcat.org/title/cymon-and-iphigenia-painted-by-sir-frederick-leighton-the-story-of-the-picture-illustrated/oclc/561621561 




 I literally have no idea how to help you. But you really need to see a doctor about your sore. Please update us again soon. 




 Anything new in the last few hours? 




 Agreed! 




 Leopard print bandaid FTW! I thought I was paranoid too. 




 Yeah. I assumed they were drinking. The last guy talked about beer a fair bit in his comments. 




 Keep posting them here just make one account and get all your dates to post from the same one, in the same post. That way it looks like a "saga" and the mods don't delete it for not being a story. 

I like rules. They keep me from being dead. Unlike Eldon. And Warren. 




 I suggest if you have a message you'd like passed on to family or friends, you post it as a comment here and then shut down the account before she can.  




 Yeah. You're done for. Let us know if you make it out alive, but I have my doubts. 




 Oh my god. Men are idiots. 
We're not paranoid, we're trying to save you. 
You can get laid any time if you get out of there but you won't be fucking much if you're dead! 




 It's only been 46 minutes.... 




 Why wait? Why not just listen to us and get out of there? You're probably not even Eldon anymore. The winky face in the last post meant it was Mal posting. 




 I think I sped it up by trying to warn him. 
























 Can I just have your number in general? 




 There's a new one happening right now but it just... doesn't sound right. The tone is off I guess. I can't explain it. 




 Goodness. 




 Wooooowwwww. 




 Hang in there. I'm sure someone will find you. 




 Format please. Text block is really hard to read. I had a hard time with it with my own post but if you hit enter twice at the end of a paragraph you'll get the space you need.
Edit: Made it through. Put a salt circle around your bed and your son's rock and play. Update us asap please. :) 




 I had to read that a couple times to figure out what really happened. Holy shit. 




 Dude. Did you kill your wife or something...? Or are you just a big bully? 




 What's a shadowban? 




 I will take you at your word OP. What is your motivation for killing? You don't sound at all deranged or like you are having psychiatric problems. 




 Yeah we already established Clayton is immune. This doesn't have the normal tone of the mold stories to it. I wonder... Also if you kill/let someone else kill Clayton, you're screwed. And who is Rachel? 




 Which one?! I'm in Nova Scotia and it's awfully nice to see a fellow Canuck on here. 




 This advice is probably gonna get me all kinds of flack BUT when my insomnia got to the point I couldn't function and I was seeing stuff, I started smoking a joint before bed every night, taking a sleeping pill with a cup of tea, and listening to really quiet classical music til I fell asleep. I eventually weaned myself off the routine but I still struggle with getting to sleep. I hope you can beat this OP. 




 That would be terrifying. I'm really glad you made it home safe and sound.  




 I had no idea where this was going. Nice writing style OP.  




 I would have done worse than kick him. I get angry in traffic when people are acting stupid and I have my dog in the car.... I'm really glad both you and Belle are okay. Dogs may not be "worth more" than people but I can promise you I'd save my dog before I'd save a person. 




 Anyone crack the code? 




 This is fantastic. Can you tell us more about Iggy, like what you've been up ti with him since, and if Roy is doing well? Dean Koontz often writes abut dogs and I must say the humor and descriptions here really reminded me of him. 




 I've seen this posted and read this like 3 times now.  




 Mold mold mold. You can't fix it. Get your sister and your dog and RUN. 




 Any news OP? 




 My dad was a trucker. He did long-haul all through my childhood. I have the utmost respect for what you do. Please be damned careful in this town. 




 I got so excited I teared up.  




 OH MY GOD IT'S THE MOLD I COULD CRY!!!!!!!! 




 I don't think I've ever smoked up at 4:20pm or am. It was always at like lunch time during school, or 11 or 12 at night right before bed. 

OP, I've heard that if someone you know calls your name, you should wait until they do it a second time, because the first is the devil or something trying to get your attention.  As for the doorbell, I've had it happen a few times. Always when I'm distracted, and there's other noise happening. Never had an explanation for it though. 




 Was that a typo in the story? We're compiling a list of the mistakes to see if they mean anything. 




 Nothing creepy ever happens in Nova Scotia. All the creepy stuff is elsewhere. :( 




 I haven't figured out if they're important yet. Can you let me know what the typos you've found are? We're trying to make a list to see if it means anything. 




 I may have but don't remember. Is there something I should know/read for reference? 




 Porkchop I need to know more!!!!! 




 IT MIGHT BE THE MOLD DON'T ASK QUESTIONS JUST IN CASE HE GOES AWAY! 




 You can also spell anal. 




 Amazing work! Thank you so much for doing all of this.  




 In Death Agreement - Severity, it says "widow" instead of "window" and in Mr Poe of Newark, "crank" is suddenly spelled "crack." (That last one is an easy typo to make though and may not necessarily be one.) 




 You're welcome. I hope everything is alright after last night. Keep us updated and stay safe. 




 Yes! There seems to be one word or letter in each one! If you figure out what it says, can you reply here? I'm curious if it's just my own mind messing with me. 




 It could just be me. It's habit to look for messages. It's just that they're so well written any mistake seems deliberate, you know? In Back In The Alley there's a place where it says "of" but it should say "some." Also in that one, 6th paragraph, there's the word "bar" but the "a" is missing. If you come up with anything else, can you let me know?

 Motel sounds like a great plan, especially if the lights are out at home. You should be able to get bundled sage at any local occult shop but I'm not sure where else. You could try googling or searching Facebook for a local group that could help you. Wiccan groups, paranormal investigators, etc.  




 Have you found any pattern in the typos in each post? The stories are so well written something about the typos and mistaken words makes me feel like they're deliberate. 




 Salt circle around your bed, anywhere there's cracks, in doorways and windows, burn sage and waft the smoke all around your house. Start wearing a piece of sterling silver on your person. Update soon please. 




 Someone more patient than me needs to go through all these stories and see if the odd out of place words and typos are a message. They're too well written, the screw ups seem deliberate. 




 Has anyone else noticed the random typos? After reading the mold stories I'm like trained to see mistakes as hidden messages. This one says "of" instead of what I assume would be "some," and another one had an "are" in a place it didn't belong. 




 More please! I wanna know! 




 Awesome story OP. Your writing style is really engaging and easy to read. I've often heard that staring at your reflection too long will cause you to see things you don't want to see.  




 There's more? 




 I'm sorry OP. That happened to me a long time ago. PM me if you ever need to talk. 




 Hey OP any news? You doing alright? 
























 I actually might give this a shot. Sleep doesn't come easy here. 




 This isn't how nosleep works. The rules are in the sidebar.  




 Y'all okay? 




 This is why I have a dog. She barks at everything and sure sometimes that gets annoying but I'm secure knowing nothing will ever get to me without her letting me know first. 




 Hey R4R! I'm short and often grouchy and easily creeped out, and I need friends! Maybe more than friends? But mostly just friends. Anyone local? Male or female. I like working on cars, beer, bacon, boobs, baking, books, nail polish, knitting, and my dog.  




 "Chortle" made me chortle. 




 Update soon! 




 Spill the beans OP! We can probably help you but only if we have the full story. 




 Your mom may just be sticking around to keep an eye on you and the house. How long until you turn 18? I'd move in there ASAP if I were you. Just keep an eye out for anything out of the ordinary that feels threatening. 




 I really enjoy your writing. If you have more experiences, you should post them. How is your wife doing now? 




 No one ever looks for those girls. 
Queen street, Toronto? 




 Holy crap. This must be terrifying for you. 




 Best comment ever.  




 And um... "suicided?" I picture this being written in crayon by that mean kid who picks on everyone else, and his older brother let him on nosleep to scare the shit out of him. 




 It's the ring.  




 In the fall I had a feeling my ex's (who I'm still VERY weirdly close with) girlfriend was pregnant. Sure enough he told me she was. I looked at my mum that day and said "He's not gonna be a dad." I had no idea what I meant at the time but I had this feeling that something bad was going to happen. About 6 weeks later he told me she had had a miscarriage. 

Also ever since I had surgery in December I seem to be seeing things in corners and blurry places here and there and the odd shadow with no cause. Something about being put under I think. 




 Anyone else read this, hoping for the mold? 




 Same here actually. My grandad's family used to just KNOW stuff and in the last few months I've found myself KNOWING things I have no possible way of knowing. We're also prone to seeing people in places they aren't. I basically got a dog for the express purpose of letting me know when the people I see are real. 




 Happy birthday! :) You are brave and brilliant and loved. 




 Seconded. Also the reason I don't put my dog outside unsupervised. 




 I expect I'll have a baby on Friday the 13th. Hopefully the Calusari aren't hanging around. No patience for grouchy old Romanian men. 




 I'm working really hard on convincing myself they're not. I was waiting outside the recovery room for a friend after major surgery this week and kept seeing people/whatever in the hallway out of the corner of my right eye. There was no one there. It was bad. At home I'm mostly just seeing blurry spots/shadows and my cats are wild all the time. My therapy dog can't be bothered with it though I've noticed she sleeps a lot closer to me at night now. 




 Holy. Shit. Coat hanger.  




 How to freak out someone who had surgery a while ago and since sees blurry things in corners: THIS. Keep us updated OP. 




 CALL THE COPS! No one ever thinks to call the cops. 




 Thank you, captain obvious. Also, fork off.  




 Boy that was helpful. 




 This was incredible. Props OP. I don' think I blinked the whole time I was reading. 




 Business idea: open Etsy shop selling different shapes/sizes/styles of tinfoil hats. Split profits? 




 Have you ever learned more about your parents? Tell us more! 




 Death, bro. Death. 




 MORE!!! 




 Commenting before reading because was 100% listening to Jar of Hearts while scrolling /nosleep new stories. Creepy. 




 Your girlfriend's name isn't Steph is it? 




 I find passing out is almost involuntary for me after a big adrenaline rush, if that explains the sleeping at all. 




 I might never sleep again... 




 Take the cat. 




 I think they were asking if the safe contents were pictures of mob-guy's hits. I can't be positive though obviously. 




 Fantastic! So long as he's healthy, protein is protein. 




 Be careful not to overfeed poor Baxter. Too much meat can upset his stomach. ;) 




 I second the bruise thing. I have one on the top of my foot and one on the  side of my forearm and NO idea where they came from. I blame them all on the guy I hang out with but I don't think they've ever actually been his fault, they just appear. 




 Any news? How is he doing? 




 Are you in Nova Scotia? You described yourself and one of your friends EXACTLY like my best friend and his girlfriend. Her name is even Rachel and she's a ginger. 




 Mine too! 




 Hey OP. I'm a nanny and I've had a lot of strange experiences. One thing I've learned is if you want people to believe you, you need to take videos or pictures and hand them over to someone who can be objective. You could consider wall mounted baby monitors or a camcorder on a tripod, or even a cell phone video. You could also try a line of salt or brick dust at your doorway to see if she can cross it, and I would get in touch with the priest as soon as you can. Something else to consider, for someone who may be a bit more open minded, you could try contacting your local paranormal society. It seems most places have them and they can usually be contacted via facebook or a local shop. Good luck and keep us updated.  




 I swear when I was in emerg for my gall bladder, I was a little high on pain meds and saw a bubble and FREAKED OUT til the nurse explained it to me. It's a pretty widely held belief! 




 I may be. Or I may not. It all depends on your response. 




 It's... The Strangest Load I Ever Pulled. I think? Or something like that. It just sounds wrong to me. 
























 Kuru, yes? Human prion disease. Only read about half so far but needed to comment before I forgot.
Edit: X-files junkie. Prone to diagnosing everyone with Kuru and other random stuff.
Sorry about your dad, OP. 




 Take that bottle of ink you gathered to a police man okay? Tell him where you found it and that daddy is uspet about it and that Maisey is gone away. He'll have special stuff to get it out of the carpet with. 




 Can you elaborate a bit? 




 Seconded. 




 Did you get your shirt back? :( 




 Too bad the're not selling condoms, common sense, and rehab. 




 Yeah that. 




 So accurate. Half the guys I went to school with are out West now. 




 Dude. Cops and some friends. Get out there and investigate during daylight. Your missing friend is connected to that house. Please update us with what you find. 




 Nova Scotia here. Wonder how long it'll take the drug to reach us. Probably the summer when all the boys come home to visit.  




 Drugs containing a lot of sulphur can turn your blood green/blueish.  




 It's alright. Just struck me funny. I have the most boring innocuous birthday ever so something scary happening on that day is... strange to say the least. 




 Be safe. Ask a nurse if they have a charger you can borrow. Oddly enough I had great luck with that when I was in hospital.  How did you end up there? 




 Upsetting that you woke up there on my birthday.  




 Talk to her! Maybe she knows whats going on! 




 Update please. 




 Did you put her there? 




 Dude. My suggestion is wrap yourself in garbage bags and duct tape and burn that mofo!
Ps. Sorry about Vern. :( 




 Whatever it is, give it the fuck back! 




 Hopefully the cover cleaner is alright. The sterling silver is just a wive's tale my grandmere used to tell me but I've seen it mentioned in my research, as a way to protect yourself. So it has to be worth a shot. 




 This is removed but was it connected to the infected town? 




 Nosleep is here. Talk to us. We can help. 




 Man... 
I have an odd relationship with one of my exes. We love one another and we're really close with a weird bond no one can understand. Anyway. In October I was talking to my Mum about said ex and saying I thought his girlfriend might be pregnant. So I had asked him about it and he was surprised as they had just found out but yes, she was pregnant. I knew the moment I got that text message from him that he "wasn't going to be a dad." So I told my mum and although we didn't know what I meant, we figured it was important to remember I had said it. He texted me on Christmas day to tell me she was having a miscarriage. I fully understand the guilt and I wish I could explain where those feelings come from. I haven't been able to look him in the eye since, for feeling like I caused her to lose the baby. 




 Do some research and post a story letting us know what you find! 




 Next time just drive on your flat. A destroyed rim is better than a dead you. I'm super glad you're okay, just know that you CAN drive on your rim. 




 Are you dead? Did you die in childbirth? 




 Yeah I was just about to lean out the window and have a smoke... thanks for helping me cut back OP. 




 Technically until all of the "remnants" are expelled, you are still pregnant. Also there's that whole baby dies in utero but you have to keep carrying it until labor can be induced thing.  




 Holy.... sh!t. 




 Jerk. 
But also... this was really good.  




 SO what is it then, that makes it so you can't feel pain in your dreams? And how are you getting the wee cuts? I feel like I've missed something and that bothers me 'cause I'm covered in the damn things all the time. I just chalk it up to sharing a bed with a grouchy black cat and a 30lb border collie with no concept of personal space. But it still bothers me. 




 I am never ever ever ever ever going to play laser tag ever as long as I live. 




 Light bulb shaped, with cat eyes. So... alien?
The questions I have... You must have twice as many. 




 Keep us updated. I wish I had the answers. Tell her to wear or carry a piece of sterling silver on her when she's working. 




 Well that's strange. Keep us updated, yeah?  




 No problem. I'm basically the stain master around here. I can get anything out of anything. ;) 




 Am a Ma'am. :) 




 This. 
There's some really good ones on here tonight! 




 Friggin' amazing. 




 Peroxide is great for blood stains. Corn starch for anything oily. Maybe consider getting a van or having a room in a house that you can cover in plastic and keep clean.  




 A: Against /nosleep rules.
B: What are you doing here in the first place?
C: You're a jerk. Get off our sub. 




 Put a salt circle around your bed. Keep us updated. 




 Try editing it. This seems to happen a lot lately. 




 Burn the doll. 




 Well okay then I'm totally down for a visit. :) 




 Have you ever been on /nosleep before? 




 I'd love to come visit but not if I'm gonna end up in the cistern. 




 Holy crap. 
























 Doing it now. 5:25am and counting. 




 It's like Scully's implant!  




 I'm not even fully a ginger, but man do I ever know the sun's true nature. 




 I just spent WAY too long googling lorazepam and irritable bowel. I'd be interested to see if it actually helps. 




 Why is there not more?!?!?!? My cousin sent me the link and I read the whole thing in 2 hours. PLEASE tell us what has gone on since! 




 1 - Creepy
2 - Bugs
3 - Places to hide
4 - Bears
5 - X-Files
6 - The Hills Have Eyes
7 - Wrong Turn
8 - Blair Witch Project
9 - half the stories on Nosleep
Basically just repeat those til you get to #374.  




 Yes sorry if I came off as a jerk. I was actually responding to them but must have clicked the wrong "reply." And I was talking about this sub. Nosleep is like my big dysfunctional family. 




 I'd have the police check around next door. Those sounds could easily be a burglary or squatter. Or wax Henry come to hang out with live Henry. 




 Dude. Follow the rules of GTFO. 




 Hey OP update soon okay? Hospitals don't usually end well for the folks on here. Can you give us any more info/details on the woman? It seems like this might have happened elsewhere, if there's someone going around taking out the doppelgangers. 




 We don't NEED proof here. That's not how it works.  




 Was it your last summer there because of the "murders?" Did you ever want to go back? If your dad has any stories you should post them! 




 Police. Call the police. Tell them you left your door open during a walk and now there's strange noises and your dog is acting like there's someone else in the house. It's better to have them think you're nuts, and know they didn't find anything, than it is to risk something happening to you and your animals. 




 Reason #374 why I don't go near the woods. EVER.
Hope you're doing okay, OP. Where were you bleeding from? Do you have any bites or anything? 




 With weapons and a guarantee of hand holding, I would join a large group expedition to check things out. 




 Also strange: living a (mostly) normal life and then realizing at 23 that sometimes you know stuff before it happens and that you have all your life but never anything serious. Til now. 




 I've always wanted to try DMT but having never done more than smoke a little weed and REALLY enjoy dilaudid, I've been chicken shit. This basically solidified for me that I'll never try it.
Be careful if you go back though. 




 I vote ingratiating yourself to them and learning the trade. If you can't beat'em, join'em! 




 That's actually how it feels in my head most of the time. Eat well, stay hydrated, advil helps the throb and lorazepam slows things down a bit. Trust me. I'm a part-time nanny and on contract with the petroleum board. You can handle this. 




 I wasn't so much saying you were BEING rude, as I was saying that being rude here is a very efficient way of screwing yourself out of an answer. I'm in Canada so maybe the rules are a bit different. I had an uncle who left the RCMP to become a PI. I hang out with car guys so I have had a plentiful helping of what cops are "really like" despite my healthy respect for the profession. Is there really no one on the force you could talk to? I mean even in passing just be like "hey remember that asshole kid who did that thing with the dogs? He just bought a leash and some machetes." I mean if all else fails you could go the vigilante route. 




 That's not how nosleep works bro. 




 I don't think I would have accepted Dean's explanation of his odd behavior when you went over there. Keep an eye on things and be suspicious of everything for a while. Remember how scared he made you? 




 Seconded. 




 Nosleep is a great place to ask for help but if you're going to be rude to the people here you're more likely to get downvoted to hell than actually helped. 
Otherwise, unless you're off the force for being mentally unfit or otherwise a danger to the public, maybe it's time to ditch WalMart and start a private detective business? So you can keep an eye on things and earn a bit of credibility with the police again so when things do catch your eye, you actually have somewhere to go with it. 




 Honey... you didn't go to the zoo. Can you go on a walk and find a policeman? Tell him about going to the zoo. He'll help make sure you have lots to eat. 




 God should probably reconsider saying stuff like that... it freaks people out. 




 Update us ASAP OP. How is Willow? 
Get her out of the house either with the police or her mum, get some friends round to help you gather up your stuff, get the cash, and get the hell away from there.  




 No it was perfect. Just what I needed. But I'd love to know more. 




 Take some time and get your thoughts together and then it's lawsuit time. 




 I did actually start crying at the part where you said if you've ever lost a dog, they're there. Some odd stuff has gone on tonight with my old dog's ashes and my new dog suddenly staring at the urn and wanting to lick it. You should maybe stop helping people get there early but thank you, because tonight what I really needed was to know that she's having fun and she gets to be a puppy again. 




 Are you... are you repeating the day? Or dead...? 




 Could you elaborate a bit on what you said about seeing what Darryl has become since coming back? 




 Talk to a counselor at school about the rain and how you've been feeling because of it. 




 As a nanny... this is terrifying.  




 Yeah dude they start filming this summer and FOX has signed them both on for a 6 episode run! With all the original writers and stuff too. 




 Someone please link this guy to glitch in the matrix. 




 Just a heads up this is probably going to get taken down as an "intro." 




 Just touch the garlic. You don't have to eat it. Stay safe! 




 Any tiny puncture marks anywhere on her OP? Needle sized up to about the size of a canine tooth? Keep her hydrated. Maybe also let us know your reaction to garlic in your next update. 




 Stay away from my animals or you won't have to worry about what you might become, unless you have particular worries about being worm food. 




 I know it's hard to imagine but... maybe you can feel her because of the connection children have to ghosts. And maybe that's why your husband moved her away, because she's interacting with you and it scares him. If what happened to you was painful that could be why thinking about it and trying to figure out what happened hurts you.  




 So true. We produce a never-ending supply of disposable workers who when they leave there come home and lead productive lives with their wives and.... fuck that who am I kidding. They come home addicted to drugs, living on welfare because being there teaches them ZERO marketable skills, and generally torturing an already struggling area. And you, my friend, are the first person I've spoken to who knows that's what's happening as well as I do. 




 I think probably burning her body and then mixing the ashes with some salt and spreading them around a place she liked. Maybe a good scrub down of the house as well, replace some flooring, new paint, breathe some new life into your place. It can do wonders for clarity and peace of mind. I'd also probably get a new bed, if money allowed for it.  




 Amazing.
Edit: Amazing rescue and beautifully captured imagery. I have very few memories that are that clear. Props OP. Glad you're safe. 




 You and Tom find the cadaver he was snacking on. There must be some security cameras down there. Contact campus police or whoever and ask them to look at the footage as something strange was going on when you walked in. I think people donate their bodies to the lab right? But there's a lot of legal stuff. The authorities are likely to take it seriously if you think tampering of any sort is happening. If campus police won't listen I suggest going to the Dean and involving regular police. Until then, keep the deadbolt in place and pee somewhere else. 




 I'm so sorry. Have you tried Ebay or something to find another? /3 




 It comes from eating human flesh in general. It's a prion processing disorder. You can also have similar symptoms from eating only one meat for an extended period. Things build up in your system over time. Colloquial knowledge tends to mix up Kuru and CreutzfeldtJakob disease. That could be where the misunderstanding came from. 




 Totally what made me think of it. PS. X-files is back for 6 episodes! 
























 I'll check it out but when I looked at the AL Finder map there were only 6 people in my area. :( 




 Wherever that is, I need to go there. This community sucks. 




 IT'S SO SMALL. There's like 25 of us here and like 85% are exes and then another 10% is friends with one or the other half of the exes, and then the other 5% is apparently invisible. 




 Not here! That's why I'm asking about other people's communities! Here anyone you think might be butch is gender queer or trans. Which is TOTALLY fine. But butch women seem to be curiously absent! Leading me to wonder if it's just here, or if it's everywhere! 




 Pardon?
I guess the simplest explanation is:
Women who dress in a masculine fashion, and don't feel a need to identify as anything except women who dress in a masculine fashion. 




 It's... Well it's a difficult explanation really. Because it's one of those silly sub-types of labels. BUT. To me it's truly butch, not androgynous. Not trans. Manners, cockiness, knowing how to treat a lady. I fully expect to catch heat for this but it's women who enjoy being women but also dress like men and don't feel the need to be anything BUT a woman who dresses masculine. 

That was the worst explanation ever. I'm sorry. 




 Hey all!
I have a question!
Do "old school butch" women still exist? Where I live (Atlantic Canada) it seems like "true butch" just got totally obliterated before I was even a baby gay.
What are your communities like? Does "old school butch" mean anything to you? All opinions welcome! Show me what you know! :) 




 What is ftfy? 




 Court can call it whatever they want, but it's still rape.  




 Lol. Read a book. 




 Also I'd like to add that spontaneity is a factor, as well as potential intoxication. Those things, being drunk, high swept up in a moment, they can cloud your judgement. You may realize once you're in a situation that you're not comfortable. You should then be able to say that no, you're not comfortable, and that the situation needs to end. 

If we equate what you've said to a different crime perhaps you will see where you went wrong. On a first date, should I inform the person that I'm having tea with that I wouldn't be comfortable being murdered in any way, and that abduction is not something I'm into?  




 What's unrealistic is to state your sexual boundaries before you've even spent time with a person and gauged sexual chemistry and interest. I shouldn't have to start every first date with "I need to have protected sex." Because clearly I'm not going to have sex with all of those people. No does actually mean no, even though that phrase has been used to much it has almost no meaning now. I should be able to decide at any point during a sexual encounter that what's happening is not okay with me, and have that encounter end or change pace. I shouldn't be forced to complete an act I'm not comfortable with simply because I did not state when I met this person, that I was uncomfortable with something. 




 I probably wouldn't physically push anyone. Girls like that... they won't necessarily let it stop at that and the next thing you're in jail for "beating her up." 




 Please do!  




 I knew there was logic behind my irrational fear of amusement parks. 




 Everyone should have a Mrs. Ara.

 Is your dog okay?  




 I seriously would not let her out of my sight. Nothing has ever happened to my girl but in the city I live in, bad things happen to small dogs A LOT. She goes out on a leash AND we have a fence with a gate that makes a ton of noise. Call me paranoid if you want.
Do you have any enemies you can think of, OP? Do your parents? 




 I'm sorry the comments section is full of a bunch of jokes. Not sure what happened there. What did it feel like, grabbing your hand? Another hand? Smooth? Scales? Etc. Did you guys find somewhere else to sleep? What did your husband have to say? 




 Holy shit dude. It already happened once? Talk to your parents again, see if you can get someone to watch her during the day. I dog sit, but I'm betting you're too far away for me to help you. 




 He's a dickhole!! Or an assdick. 




 It got removed cause it was too short. Maybe add it here instead? 
I hope your pup is okay. I know I would go pretty batty if anyone tried to hurt my girl. 




 I know right? Nothing since the nose bleed except more heartburn but seriously waking up and reading this scared the bejesus out out of me. 




 Smash it. Burn the pieces. Mix whatever's left and all the ashes with a whole bunch of salt, put it all in a jar, and leave it in a church. 




 Any thoughts on what she was/is? Your description made me think Fae, dark Fae clearly. Let us know if you've got any information on her! 




 They're Fae. And you've pissed them off. Leave small bowls of offerings, honey, milk, sweets, etc, near the circle. While you're there tell them who you are, why you're there, and apologize for disturbing them. Tell them you mean them no harm. And keep us updated!
Edit: My family always said to ward off Fae you should carry a piece of iron on you and place it above your doorways as well. We use horseshoes above the doors. The Fae can't stand iron. Nor can they stand salt so putting a line of salt at your exterior doorways should keep you safe when you're indoors. 




 Deathly heartburn and random nausea last night, bloody nose this morning. Well fuck. Am I gonna die? 




 Fucking furbies. I "accidentally" left mine behind when we moved house a few years ago. Hope whoever moved in had a great time with the little bastard. 




 That's basically why I don't pick up in bars. Ya never know what you're taking home. 




 I love bikers. Y'all are so tough but if a toddler hands you a plastic phone you're damn sure gonna answer it. I hope those of you left make it out alright. Keep us updated. 




 It's gone anyway but disbelief doesn't belong here. Everything is true on Nosleep.

 But people are just so much more terrible... and they inspire so much more grief.  




 You're a fucking lunatic. If your idea of fun is killing an animal, I hope someone gets the same joy out of killing you. Kill people. They are inherently bad and they deserve it. Animals have done nothing wrong. 




 Welcome, friend. It happens to the best of us. 




 Honey I think you might have died. Maybe you're in someone else's body, maybe you're not. But you need to do some research. Google the car accident. See if you died. If you look hard enough you should be able to find death certificates. Maybe listen to the guy on the phone, too. 




 So many babies here. So many.  




 You're not supposed to break character. That's the whole point of the sub. Everything here is true. 




 That isn't how things work here. 




 Maybe just stop killing her... Tell someone when you see her. A doctor or a police officer. Anyone who knows what happened in the past. 




 Okay so. I'm sorry for what happened but this may be the wrong Sub... 




 Tell us what happened next! Did you confront your parents? What happened to Margaret?! 




 Salt!! In all the doorways and in a circle around your bed. Also, lazy arse, start shoveling. I've been shorter than the snow banks for weeks here and haven't put the shovel down yet. If you're still alive, give us an update! 




 First of all, the part where her blood was green was actually a story she had told from a previous time. Not actually a part of the events of OP's account. Secondly, it takes an extraordinarily large and long-term addiction to the drugs to produce the green blood reaction. For example, mixing heroin and oxycontin for an extended period will sometimes produce it. However, everyone's body chemistry is different and not everyone will have the same reaction. AND you just broke the rules of this sub. No disbelief. 




 Really? 




 Thanks. I've started doing that too. Not eating when I know I'll be out all day. Quitting smoking made it so unbearable that I didn't leave my house for 2 weeks and basically just decided to keep smoking so I could walk my dog without incident. I haven't sorted out what triggers it yet, I seem to just be on a 3 day rotation of can't stop/can't go. Maybe I'll give the walk in clinic a shout and see what they can do for me! Thanks! 




 That would just be magical. No more gallbladder = spanking new case of ibs. Still haven't mastered that whole being far away from a toilet thing yet. I would literally try anything to help. Even some of the questionable Nosleep style remedies. 




 Both I guess but mostly your sister.
