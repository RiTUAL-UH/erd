 I know canon was the same, but I think it's too implausible that Quirrell happened to come across V just when Tom was about to come to Hogwarts, with exactly enough time for him to get a job. 




 Why is Voldemort known to be Tom Riddle? There seems to be no good reason for him associating them, so why isn't his Voldemort persona anonymous?   



















 The situation between H and Q looks like classic Parfit's Hitchhiker. They each have no reason to cooperate afterwards, but have reason to believe that they will.

So who thinks this is all a leadup to a discourse on how to solve the problem in full generality? 



















 I see a bunch of tumblr posts (see https://www.tumblr.com/tagged/inappropriate-audition-songs) which follow the format of 

Hi Ill be auditioning for the role of X and Ill be singing Y by Z.

What's going on? 














 1. Hypothesis: "Harry" is a trigger that brings back his memories when said by Quirrell, which is why he never said it before.

2. Snape taught at Hogwarts for 7 years. Harry is 11, and was 1 when his parents died. Snape only came to Hogwarts 3 years after Voldemort disappeared, which is 3 years later than in canon. See http://www.hp-lexicon.org/timelines/timeline_snape.html, which sources this from canon. This is probably significant.

3. I'd like to mention my last theories thread, which didn't get much attention because it was posted right before the new chapter. https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2w0xiz/last_crazy_thread_before_it_updates_spoilers_102/

4. I think Snape is being controlled by Quirrell also, as I don't expect Sprout to be powerful enough to have downed him. Remember, everyone found it *plausible* that Snape had actually downed Quirrell in Diagon Alley, so Snape must be pretty powerful. 



















 Here, in no particular order, are all my crazy theories/questions that I wanted to get out before the update, from my notes. Assume spoilers all:

1. Why didn't Lucius know that Harry wasn't getting his mail? He should have at least asked Draco to tell him if Harry got anything or something.
2. There's precedent for Harry's thoughts being hidden; Harry's plan to have Draco rule wasn't mentioned until he said it in the meeting (assuming it was true).
3. Why did H C talk to Zabini and then immediately obliviate him? Seems wasted.
4. Why didn't they try to test Lucius to see if he was telling the truth about the Mark?

His own Death Eaters did not know it until afterward, hence the false Mark I bear; though since I did not truly consent, it does not bind me.

Surely someone had a test that would tell whether the Mark bound him? Since they thought that the Mark sealed the lips of the bearers about itself, why didn't they demand that Lucuis tell them how the Mark worked, and test the response? This seems much simpler than Harry's thing with the actual mark.

* 5. Why is the prank when Harry learns about time-turners in his style? Presumably Harry would still cooperate with the prank regardless of whether it matched his style, so what does that tell us about how Time works?
* 6. Why didn't Lucius know at the trial that Harry could cast a patronus? He gave Draco Veritaserum, right?
* 7. Mcgonagall seems to have a *lot* of killing intent. Why?
* 8. Snape is a Legilimens, which implies he's a perfect Occlumens as well. Why did Voldemort think he could trust the prophecy that he took out of his mind?

I omitted a few that I couldn't figure out they meant. Need to take clearer notes to make time-travel communication easier ... 








































































































 The first time I read through HPMOR (until chapter 101), I really didn't think Quirrell was Voldemort and behind both the Hermione plots. The main reason for that was because Dumbledore had a lot of evidence pointing towards him, and I kept on switching back and forth between thinking Dumbledore did one or both of them to Quirrell or some other perp. (What's mentioned in Harry's conversation with Lucius seems to pin it down, as well as some other things throughout the book.)

Then I saw that [Meta Spoiler](#s "EY had confirmed QQ=V in a retracted Author's note, which confused me. I now think it's almost impossible for that not to be true in at least some sense, or for QQ to not be behind both the duel and troll.")

However, all the evidence that points to Dumbledore is still there, and I don't want to blame *all* of that on Quirrell setting things up.

So my hypothesis is that Q and D are in this together, where "this" is some plan involving getting Harry to fulfill both of their wants.

Evidence in favor of this:

1. Dumbledore accepts Q apparently without needing to know who he is
2. Dumbledore doesn't grow suspicious of Q at any point in the year
3. There are pieces of evidence pointing to both D and Q for the same plots
4. Dumbledore let Harry off too easy for the prison breakout
5. Dumbledore plays along with the plot to get Hermione sent to Azkaban

Pieces of evidence against:

1. Dumbledore lost a lot in the war against V, including his brother (perhaps it's not really him/taken over by Horcrux, or brother's death was staged)
2. Dumbledore appears moral (perhaps he still believes in the greater good/ is trying to achieve immortality despite what he told Harry)

I'm willing to bet for this at 10:90% odds (I'll put up 1 to your 9). Any takers or alternate offers?

Edit: archived at https://archive.today/cZlqY for the bets.

Got this email with the subject line "[ATTENTION SENIORS] If you have $20, this explosive cryptocurrency could change your life"

https://imgur.com/a/F6E7L

So, of course, I immediately clicked on the link, curious which alt coin they were pushing.
The link was to http://pro.wallstreetdaily.com/TAOREWARDSUSPRC/LTAOR209/?h=true, and the long text explanation of what was being sold is at http://pro.wallstreetdaily.com/TAOREWARDSUSPRC/LTAOR209/Full?h=true

Some hilarious excerpts

The value of Bitcoins in circulation has now topped $1.5 billion  more than twice the market cap of Apple.
No wonder major companies like Dell, Amazon, and Target, all accept Bitcoin as payment.

Hahahahahahahaha.

Someone must have done the math too quickly, and thought that Apple's market cap was 700 *million* instead of billion.

And apparently Amazon and Target now accept bitcoins. Wonder if they got that from Gaw? That would also fit with the "get in for under $20" hahahaha.

Before I reveal this opportunity in detail, please allow me to **formerly** introduce myself.

Wait, does that mean you already introduced yourself?

No wonder Americas elite are using it too, including Jerry Seinfeld, Robert DeNiro, and Britney Spears. Its rumored that Denzel Washington used this currency to pay for a $30 million private jet.

Yeah, you can say anything in an article and that will make it have been "rumored". This probably can't be topped.

Even President Obama flashed it to the world while purchasing his lunch.

I take that back.

However, Ive discovered an amazing loophole in Americas rewards-points system.

And you chose to share it with all of us, of course. Wonder what that implies about its viability?

The report reveals the company actively mining Americas top rewards points systems...

Ooh! Mining!

I peg the value of your first opportunity at upwards of $56,700.

... and I'll sell it to you for only $9.99. Aren't I nice?

On page 109 Chris reveals how a morning stop to his local 7-Eleven made him a fortune. Since Chris is an avid Snapple drinker, one day, he noticed the stores shelf spaaaaaace for Snapple products had shrunk from two full refrigerators to less than half of one.
He immediately took action, executing his incredibly simple information arbitrage strategy.
The very next week, Snapple announced that its inventory of unsold products had sharply risen, negatively impacting the companys profits.
Chris tripled his investment in a few days.

... is there anything I could even say to this? My guess is that he is either flat out lying, or invested in hundreds of companies and only reports the profitable ones.

Chris reveals how a friends unassuming Facebook post scored him a quick 50% gainer. The post simply said, Oh my! Chuggington?!!! I think my kids have died and gone to heaven!
Within days of observing the post, Chris perfectly executed his information arbitrage strategy and invested ahead of Chuggington becoming a smash hit among children. 

How can I get him to follow me so I can pump everything I own to this very rich person?

Below are a few of the fantastic letters I received from readers last week...

This is in almost every scam pitch I've ever seen.



Final thoughts: I am really disappointed. If you're going to write a scam pitch, at least make sure all the irrelevant facts in it are true. Also, this is dated from October, so why did I only get an email this week? Someone's slacking off.

(The company referred to is http://investor.points.com/, and obviously Robert Williams owns a large number of shares in it.)

 I know that the code says for coins not to be mined eventually. However, bitcon is likely to be hard forked many times by then, and miners are the ones who decide what happens, so why won't they just decide to continue making coins? They won't have the same commitment to keeping the protocol as us 100 years back, and would do whatever is best for them. Assuming bitcoin is still around then, what factors will affect whether coins stop being mined like scheduled?

The same question goes for every halving. What incentive will miners have to play along? 




 I think we're over due for a crazy theories thread, so here! My own list will hopefully get typed up on the 27th if I get around to it.

 In the conversation Harry had with Mcgonagall in Diagon Alloy, we learn that he isn't superstitious:

Um Harry said. He took a deep breath. Thered been some muggings in our neighborhood, and my mother asked me to return a pan shed borrowed to a neighbor two streets away, and I said I didnt want to because I might get mugged, and she said, Harry, dont say things like that! Like thinking about it would make it happen, so if I didnt talk about it, I would be safe. I tried to explain why I wasnt reassured, and she made me carry over the pan anyway. I was too young to know how statistically unlikely it was for a mugger to target me, but I was old enough to know that not-thinking about something doesnt stop it from happening, so I was really scared.

So it is surprising that on at least two other occasions, in Chapter 21 and 38, he does things which are blatantly superstitious. 

And Harry was sitting in the cavern level of his trunk, slid shut and locked so no one could get in, a blanket pulled over his head, waiting for the week to be over.
10:01.
10:02.
10:03, but just to be sure
10:04 and the first week was done.
Harry breathed a sigh of relief, and gingerly pulled the blanket off of his head.

and:

He didnt sit at the same nearby table hed sat down at with Draco, the first time hed prepared to board this train. That seemed like tempting history to repeat itself.

I'm *very* wary of suggesting this, but as it happened twice, maybe it's significant? Could someone have messed with his mind enough to change how he thought about fate? We know from the first chapter that magic caused Harry to believe that it existed without proper evidence (or at least that's how I read it, as confirming that intuitions exist in HPMOR). But Harry still hadn't updated by the time of the Diagon Alley talk, for some reason. 









 death, taxes, and people who can't count. 









 If partial transfiguration is just "enforcing a relation between separate past and future realities, instead of changing anything over time", then why can't it be used for arbitrary time-travel? Enforce a relationship between the me of "whatever now means" and the me of "now shifted to the past/future"? 


































 Harrys own voice said, then, sounding strange in present-Harrys ears, He has a surprisingly good explanation.

Why did Harry say that? Obviously, the direct cause of that statement was that Future!Harry remembered hearing it while he was Present!Harry. However, this doesn't explain the real cause. We know from elsewhere in HPMOR that time seems to do that kind of stuff when there would otherwise be a paradox. So this sentence implies that, had Harry not known of a good explanation coming, something would have happened that would cause him to try to change time. What was that? What would have happened had he not been told that, that was drastic enough to cause Time Itself to twist? Remember, Harry knows Not To Mess With Time, so it would have to be **really really important** for him to try doing something.

(I'd also like to point out that, since he heard the explanation while anticipating a good one, he is automatically subject to confirmation bias, meaning he would notice less if it wasn't good, without any Harry ever deciding it was good by "himself".) 




 I've read a little bit about this "net neutrality" thingy and I don't really get why it is a good thing.

As I understand it, we (the protesters) want the FCC or whoever to keep *more* regulations. That's the first red flag. I haven't seen any explanation of why the free market wouldn't work in this case.

Second, if your ISP started slowing down smaller websites, what would you do? Well, what if there was another ISP that wanted your business, and they offered equal speeds for all websites? You know what would happen? Three guesses:

* Everyone switches to ISP #2
* Everyone switches to ISP #2
* Everyone switches to ISP #2

That's called a free market. Do you know why Sprint still offers unlimited data for smartphones after all the other US carriers started limiting the amounts? Because there's a market for it. There are people who would switch away from Sprint to whoever offered a better service.

If all these people who signed, called, emailed, and otherwise joined the campaign, instead signed a petition that they would switch away from any ISP that doesn't give all website the same bandwidth, wouldn't that create significant incentives to ISPs to maintain the status quo? And companies that might pay for faster speeds will get less people to reach with them, so the prices will go down, and the ISP will not be gaining that much, so they'll switch back to neutrality soon.

I'm willing to change my view if someone can explain what I'm missing. I'm trying to understand, and don't get it. So why does the free market fail in this instance, and why is the government needed to step in? 




 Well in chapter 9:

Though Harry had been right to consult a Ravenclaw prefect first. The young woman hadn't even looked up from her reading or identified Harry, just jabbed a wand in Neville's direction and muttered something. After which Neville had acquired a dazed expression and wandered off to the fifth carriage from the front and the fourth compartment on the left, which indeed had contained his toad.

So there's a prefect (possibly Penelope Clearwater, possibly not) who knows some mind control methods, hanging around Hogwarts and Harry. I don't think a simple charm could have done that, it seems like it would need Legilimency to get the information and Confundus, Legilimency, or Imperious to get Neville to go there. I don't see any way around the Legilimency requirement, which is "incredibly rare", and thus suspicious. Is there any other method that could have been done with standard magic, or should we be *very* suspicious of unnamed prefect?

(I suppose it could have been done by hiding the toad in a known location beforehand, then sending Neville there with a standard Confundus, but it doesn't seem like she was setting it up, and she wouldn't know that she would be approached [or she could have Confunded Harry and Neville to approach her specifically, but we're getting complexity penalties at this point.]) 




 I don't know if this theory has been proposed before, but what if

The curse on the Defence job works like the Comed-tea? That is, only wizards who are going to get caught doing a fireable offense during the next year get unexplained urges to work at Hogwarts? That might explain Quirrell's stated reason for working at Hogwarts, if he is not QuirrellMort.

Are there other plausible hypothesis for how the curse works?

It appears that only documents are included, based on filenames extensions. It also appears that many documents not in txt format were converted to txt. They were then published twice, once in original format and a second time in txt format. Not all documents, for some reason. So the true amount of documents published now is a little over a half of 30,000.

The following formats are in the list:

* xlsx
* pdf
* txt
* docx

This suggests both that Wikileaks published only "document files", not all files (and horrible reporting by those who don't have a clue), and that they only took from the 01, 02, 05, and bonus filesets.

I'll confirm when I have more time whether any documents from the other sets appear in wikileaks list, as the naming *could* just be a quirk.

Edit: nvm, it's up. https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/120/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality 









 As you know, there has been a lot of speculation that we are still in the DATA EXPUNGED. There are a couple of variations on this theme, but they all agree that REDACTED and that it really *was* REDACTED. On my recent reread, I noted all the parts in the text which appeared to support the claim that DATA EXPUNGED, and am collecting them here. There's also a section on WoG confirmations which can be REDACTED.

First, we get this right in the beginning:

Ad-free mirror of the text;

clearly implying that the entire text is inside a mirror (see document 297-T-REDACTED for further elaboration on this).

Second, we see in the intro what appears to be an obvious DATA EXPUNGED:

 This is a rationalist story;

Rationalist comes from ancient Latin from mirror. In fact, if you search google for Rationalist mirror, [hpmor comes up](https://archive.today/KzShE). But this might not be conclusive, because of REDACTED and REDACTED.

Third, we get in Chapter 6 the following

There was an abstracted look on her face (almost exactly the same look that had appeared on Harry's own face while experimenting on the pouch, if Harry had only seen himself in a mirror to realise that).

This is obviously foreshadowing DATA EXPUNGED and DATA EXPUNGED, as well as providing strong evidence that people are stuck in a mirror and can't see through it.


Fourth, there is the widely talked about DATA EXPUNGED from Chapter 6

As his hand touched the back door's handle, he heard a last whisper from behind him.

"Hermione Granger."

"What?" Harry said, his hand still on the door.

"Look for a first-year girl named Hermione Granger on the train to Hogwarts."

"Who is she?"

There was no answer, and when Harry turned around, Professor McGonagall was gone.

This strongly implies that Professor REDACTED was left out of the DATA EXPUNGED, for reasons too obvious to detail.

Further on, we observe (Chapter 10)

I am in essence a sort of mirror with which to trap children

possibly the most explicit confession in-story to date, with the possible exception of DATA EXPUNGED

Then we get to 27

The Weasley twins had tested their new monocles on the "forbidden" third-floor corridor, making a quick trip to the magic mirror, but when they tried to go back, they'd realized they were stuck forever.

Moving on, Chapter 37:

"Yes!" said Dumbledore. "My own great foe was Grindelwald, and him I understood very well indeed. Grindelwald was my dark mirror, the man I could so easily have been, had I given in to the temptation to believe that I was free of the mirror, and therefore sure of my observations.

This is starting to give some clues that the mirror is connected to Grindelwald. I looked through REDACTED to find more clues, and sure enough DATA EXPUNGED:

 I am Grindelwald. I am also the mirror, and have been so all along. I am also [Millicent Bulstrode](https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2f7csv/whats_the_craziest_theory_you_can_come_up_with/ck6mynp). Indeed, I am even DATA EXPUNGED. You are also.

So we know where it came from.

Next, let's look at chapter 54

Thirty seconds later Harry was the proud new owner of a curved mirror, and quickly walked into it (which confused his mind for a bit, before he got distracted by whatever he wanted).

And

The mirror lay alive and vibrant in his hand.

And

his mirror was perfect

This confirms that it infected Harry early on, but in case you're uncertain see 63:

 Harry had been infected by the mirror for as long as he could remember

Now, one thing we *haven't* confirmed is whether Hermione is in the REDACTED. Chapter 72:

Hermione reached into her robes, and drew out a little rod with a mirror on the end of it and an eyepiece. The mirror quickly took over her body and mind, leaving her in eternel bliss.

Plus this bit of REDACTED from 77:

Hermione hadn't tried walking past a mirror yet, she wasn't sure she wanted to.

Plus a little later in 84 we get confirmation that the mirror is responsible for Hermione dying:

The mirror cut off abruptly.

Susan, 73:

For an instant, she glowed in a strange mirror-color, like a reflection of herself, until the mirror swallowed her whole

Tracey, 74:

Well, I'm pretty sure I did," said Tracey, sounding briefly uncertain before she rallied. "I mean, I looked at myself in a mirror and I look paler and can make my wishes come true now, and I can always feel darkness surrounding me, and I was a conduit for his dread powers and everything...

Pansy, 74:

After Pansy drew out a mirror and looked at herself, she turned even paler.

Now we know where it came from, who it infected, DATA EXPUNGED and REDACTED, but who has it now? Let's look at 82:

Terrible and stern stood the ancient wizard, like he was carven from stone; beard woven of thread like iron, half-moon glasses like mirrors, and the pupils behind as sharp and unyielding as black diamond.

So there *was* a pair of glasses that [wasn't just that](https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2x4lxu/im_way_better_at_having_bad_ideas_than_good_ones/), after all.

Now, there's also a piece of evidence suggesting that DATA EXPUNGED, as well as proving that the REDACTED can hold multiple people at once (84):

The mirror transmitted a sound of muffled laughter in the background, sounding like it was coming from more than one person.

Let's skip to 100:

The mirror was in Draco's hand, and it remained lifeless as his finger mechanically tapped at the surface, over and over.

This is definite foreshadowing of the mirror breaking at some future point, which is consistent with information gotten from REDACTED.

WORDS OF GOD

There are a couple of statements from the author of reality, REDACTED, which provide support for this theory.

1. [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2xxybs/chapter_116/cp4fzlj?context=3) THEY'RE IN THE MIRROR

2. [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2xxybs/chapter_116/cp4hnx1?context=3) You're inside the mirror
3. [here](http://hpmor.com/notes/119/) yes they are still inside the Mirror of DATA EXPUNGED.

(Note: this last one is proof that even the events up to 119 are still part of REDACTED.)


Note: this was inspired by https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2w3z8p/its_been_in_front_of_us_all_along_spoilers_all/, and also by SCP. This is also a first draft, if you have any suggestions on how to make this flow better I'm open. I'm not too good at structuring long things like this.

18 minutes and counting! 
























 ... or just patent it then sue. It's a lot easier.

 First of all: I've seen parts of this out there already. I came up with this mostly on my own, trying to be original, but there's obviously not *too* much to work with, and I had already seen some attempts.

So. Harry has been told that the first thing done to him is Stunning. The obvious step here, is:

Partially transfigure himself. Harry transfigures two layers of the skin around his entire body. The outer layer is transfigured into dead skin (or something the same color), so he still looks normal. The inner layer is transfigured into a substance which blocks (preferably absorbs) at least the stunning spell.

Two tiny layers of skin coming off should be perfectly safe (have not gotten an answer from a doctor here, so don't try this at home).

He delays while talking to V as long as possible. When he's done, they "stun" him. He falls down, and makes sure his wand is pointed towards his time-turner.

He should have at least a few minutes before they begin chopping off his limbs, during which their guard will be down. He uses this to transfigure his skin into a line of *something* (will elaborate) towards his time-turner. This substance is designed to look like the surrounding air, so it is effectively invisible. Once it is in contact with the time-turner, Harry is able to transfigure the time-turner, then untransfigure it to right beside him. It is still hidden by the camouflage transfiguration. He then gets the time-turner into his hands, and twists it.

As soon as he is in the past, he sends a message to Moody, Bones, and Dumbledore, and tries to leave.

Anyway, if there are any ideas here anyone feels are new, feel free to take them and use them in your own answer. 














 ... the update notices (i.e. "the next update will be") are still there. Has /u/EliezerYudkowsky  gotten lazy or does that mean anything?

 Is it before Harry got the message? Surely summoning all the Death Eaters would notify Dumbledore, and he'd send someone to pick up Harry like by Azkaban. This didn't happen, so something I believe must be false.

Even if it's after, someone would go back in time, or know that they couldn't.

Also, where is this? Are we at the graveyard, or a "real" one assuming the one dosed was fake, or somewhere else? 




 ... that current!Harry is missing some memories, and that was masterminded by the good guys (either himself or Dumbledore). Additionally, this is causing him to act in a way that appears non-optimal, but is necessary for reasons that will be explained. (Possibly because he needs to believe some things to say them in Parseltongue.)

  Did they not completely fabricate the murder for hire charge which was enough to get him the negative media attention before the charges were dropped?

No. One out of 6 hits was set up by the agents, although it wasn't fabricated; Ulbricht did order them. The other 5 are not known to be by the corrupt agents.

How do you calculate *more* criminal activity? 









  If I can still affect it after you've already collapsed the measurement, that would seem problematic, especially if "you" and "I" refer to things the size of people.

But "I" and "You" can't communicate with each other. As far as I'm concerned, you haven't collapsed yet and are in a superposition.

You raise a good point that this may set a lower bound on how large superpositions can grow before they collapse; of course in non-Copenhagen interpretations this is irrelevant. I don't think this experiment proved it in anything near the size of a person, though.

I think defining "observer" is still an outstanding problem, but I'm just a layman. Do you know of any decent not-too-technical descriptions available about the progress of figuring out "what causes the collapse" so to speak?

I'm also a laymen, but try https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/9857/what-is-an-observer-in-quantum-mechanics and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_(quantum_physics). 









  Then goodbye causality

Why?

And who is this "you" of which you speak?

This can be any observer, does not require consciousness.

That is the hard problem of the Copenhagen interpretation.

You'll note I worded my comment to not require Copenhagen ... 




  You started talking about free market motivation of black markets and his philosophy and now you are just parsing words just to make a point .

I disagreed with what you said above, and said so.

If you have anything else to add please do so in the form of a logical discussion.

I think you are incorrect in your claim above that he "knew it was wrong", and I'd like you to either retract that statement or defend it. 









  It's a distinction without a difference in this case. So he knew he was doing something illegal, ergo he got caught and is going to jail.

No argument here.

I really don't understand what you are arguing at this point.

Your claim that he "knew he was doing something wrong", which I think is not supported.

I get it, he's is your hero

 I also take full responsibility and apologize for misrepresenting survey incentives and funding in LaCour and Green (2014).  In fact, I received a grant offer from the Williams Institute, but never accepted the funds,the LA GLBT received funding from the Evelyn and Walter Haas Jr.  Fund., and the Ford Foundation grant did not exist. 




 But how do you prevent abuse? Can I convince the server that road X has 1000 cars on it if I want to keep people away, for example?

 If you didn't see the measurement, it hasn't collapsed/decohered relative to you. So you can still affect it. 




 How do you go from "he knew and participated in illegal activity" to "he knew he was doing something wrong"?

Many people don't identify morality with law, maybe Ross is one of them. 




 Ross opened a market with very few restrictions on what could be sold. He's said many times that he did this for philosophical reasons.

You claimed that he must have thought it was wrong, but haven't explained why.

Many people have defended him and think he did nothing wrong; why is it impossible that he also thought so? 




 His lawyer claimed in sentencing that it may have been role-play, because apparently people don't always mean things they say online.

Also, one of the six hits was faked by the corrupt agents. 




 Yeah but why would J be friends with him in the first place before making sure he wasn't a purple?

 That "exploit" was for poorly made apps that didn't verify receipts. Locking down content already on a user's device is not such a great idea anyway.

MITMs with user consent are not a security problem, except insofar as users are stupid. 




 Huge impact upwards, yes. If Apple loses money in the market by dumping for less than the buy price, that money goes to the other people in the market and supports a higher price. 




 You said he must have thought it was wrong, but why couldn't he have thought free markets are right? 




 That's an issue with the law, not the trial. 




 You can't destroy a market without holding coins, at least not directly. Buying then selling has little effect. Shorting could have a greater effect, but only insofar as Apple has the ability to short, and there are probably limits.

Declaring debate over is a very bad sign. 




 That was the same complaint parent had rephrased. Many hodlers wouldn't sell except at exorbitant prices, I don't know how many coins are like that, but I'd expect a significant amount of coins to go unsold if Apple stepped in. 




 Maybe that's because they didn't have much of a case. There were also a bunch of tactical mistakes made by the defense.

Do you think all trials with guilty verdicts are shams? 




 They couldn't get all (some have been burned, Satoshi's, etc), but likely can get an 80% majority if they were willing to use all their money on it. 




 You seem to think somebody can't actually believe in free markets enough to break the law, why is that? I'm not following your logic here. 




 What parts of the trial were shammy? 




 When was a plea offered? 




 It wasn't always clear, tobacco companies lied for years about it. There's a reason they paid billions to lawsuits.

 That's irrelevant to my view, which is strictly consequentialist and therefore doesn't care about blame.

 I looked at the context, and referenced it above.

He's clearly talking about a one-time increase, if you look at the code at the beginning of the thread. There's absolutely nothing that implies multiple increases, as you claimed above, and have not shown. 














  The point is that "auto increases over time" is equivalent to what Satoshi meant by "phase it in."
 Both of which refer to making the change non-abrupt -- with ample warning, ample lead time, etc.

No. Auto increases mean that no hard forks would be necessary in the future, the block size would increase whenever it's needed. What Satoshi wrote was just a single one-time increase. 




 The part you claimed above to be from Satoshi was the "auto increases over time", which wasn't in that post.

 No. First of all, the 20MB blocks would only be valid on top of all the blocks from now to the fork date.

You'd need 50% to do this. 




 Phased in, in context, means that clients that upgrade aren't immediately incompatible with older clients until a specific point is reached.

In other words, don't switch to bigger blocks until a delay. 




 Huh? Satoshi's proposal was just increasing to a new hard limit.

Tell me cops/FBI aren't sometimes untrustworthy, crooked, and famously fraternal, that media doesn't get it wrong like when they posted a front page picture of a high school athlete and his track coach under a screaming headline labeling them the Boston bombers.

Nothing I've said implies that the media don't get things wrong; I feel strongly the opposite of that view.

Give me a reason why lawyers, judges, cops themselves, constitutional rights organizations, and your mom last night say the smartest, safest action to take when you're in trouble with cops is never talk to cops.

There are several reasons, but this is irrelevant; the silence here was in an interview to the media, not to the police.

I don't hate cops (for reference, I full on hate you), but I won't put my trust in them to act in my interest.

 This is mentioned as a potential problem on the weaknesses page on the bitcoin wiki, and also links to a page on getting around the timestamp issue.

Go tell whoever wrote that they have no idea what they're talking about. 




 It's not going to be noticeable over the short term. There are sometimes hour-long gaps between blocks. One or two blocks generated at a slower rate won't set off anything.

I'm not the first to mention this vuln of only connecting to one node, I've seen devs saying similar. 




 The judge ruled otherwise. If Ross had claimed an interest in it, they might have needed to justify, but as it was Ross had the burden of proof and failed to meet it. 




 They don't have to justify it, contrary to your claim. The fact that they did is irrelevant.

My point then was whether they need to know the search is legal. 




 You said
 And they have to justify their authority to do so.

I saw what you said about third parties, I was bringing out a different point then. 




 Do you not understand the scenario I've been describing? I start with block X, generating blocks, then send them to you when I'm ready. The timestamps are after X.

You keep on adding new checks which nobody ever checks, and would be trivial to exploit if implemented in code. 




 You claim that they need to justify their authority to search, however it would seem the burden of proof is on the defendant that the search was illegal. 




 They might not, as I said, I'm unaware of case law dealing with that specific question.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Search

has

The Supreme Court has held that the Fourth Amendment does not apply to information that is voluntarily given to third parties.

but it's not clear whether the police need to *know* that it was given at the time of search. The government's argument would say no, because Ulbricht had no expectation of privacy for the server due to its violating ToS, so he can't throw evidence out.

http://www.wired.com/2014/10/feds-silk-road-hack-legal/ also says it might not be true that the Feds can search foreign property. 




 I generate them in advance, and only send them to you when you connect. 




 Yes, but they didn't search every server, only the server SR was on. 




  In order to mine blocks after X you have to have hashing power equal to the total hashing power of the bitcoin network at block X.

No, because you have more time. If you have 1%, then you can mine 1 block in 100*10 minutes on average.

Plus you have to continue to do this without falling significantly behind for an average of 1008 blocks (to next difficulty change).

I only need to do this for 1 or 2 blocks, however many confirms you'll require. 




 I'm giving you all the blocks up to X, plus two that I mined. This should be clear from my post. 




 Huh? Mine is exactly 98 blocks shorter than the real one.

Also, would you notice? 




  All I need to start is a copy of the genesis block hash -- any chain you give me can be verified to be the correct one from this genesis block.

Nope. I start a chain from block X, mine two blocks on it. Send it to you. This chain is X+2 blocks long.

The real chain has X + 100 confirms in the meantime. You don't see it, because you only connected to me.

You have the wrong chain. 




  Your argument is a straw man.

I wanted you to clarify what you meant, thanks.

From your original post it seemed like you think there's a duty to break laws not affecting you. 




 Or, don't enter a regulated market. Plenty of people have made quick money in non-regulated markets (e.g. Flappy Bird). 




 1. Do you think the law against possession of child p is unjust?
2. If the answer to 1 is yes, do you have any, and if not, how is that consistent with what you said above? 




  But to know that it violated the party's ToS, they'd have to have some reasonable suspicion (or whatever the nomenclature is).

They had freaking reasonable suspicion, it said on the site it sold drugs! (Technically they didn't know it was a third party until after they found it, so it may have been legal, but they couldn't have known until afterwards. So it would have been illegal (possibly) if it had been on his own server in the US. Whether that's valid is an interesting question, but I don't know if there's precedent.) 




 There are so many unjust laws out there. Why should I do the research it takes to break them? I bet you haven't broken every unjust law, either. 




 Parent was implying a pardon is wrong if he didn't break the law. 




 They didn't admit it until the trial.

I've seen a theory that Dratel didn't want to admit it until he had to, because that would reduce public support for Ross, which was paying his bills. 




 Actually no. The government claimed that they found the server legally. Ross challenged that, but refused to claim a personal interest in the server, so that was never ruled on. So as far as we know, it's possible it would have been ruled legal anyway.

(I think the government's argument was at least partially plausible; basically that it was outside the US, and handed over to a third party in violation of said party's ToS, and therefore didn't have 4th amendment rights.) 




 The murder for hire stuff was also on his computer, thus not editable by the agents who were corrupt. 




 The second of the ones I quoted, or

sabotage bitcoin by excluding clients and nodes

Sorry I was unclear.

I agree that if limits are set too high, then one small miner can do this. My system would allow anyone to bid for the blocksize, so it will be chosen by those who most want it, as in the Coase theorem. 




 You badly underestimate fools. 




 This started because someone said that you only needed to connect to them if you trust them, and you said trust is not required

I don't have to trust you -- the proof of work gives me trust. :)

You're right that if you connect to one good node then you'll end up with the right chain, but if you connect to only one node that isn't trustworthy, you have no guarantee that you'll be on the right chain. You can verify the chain, but you don't know if there's a bigger one out there. 




  If you have access to the internet, you could get access to a list of nodes.
 I'd imagine future clients will check for validity by comparing the responses from multiple nodes.

That doesn't help, unless you manually choose some nodes, and abort if you don't get a response from some of them. 




  and also the risk of a rogue miner using oversize blocks to knock competitors off the market, or sabotage bitcoin by excluding clients and nodes

The first of these is irrelevant to my system. The second can only be done by multiple miners colluding, in fact it requires 51%. 




 It doesn't really matter if you can iterate. 




 `x--` 




 It acts exactly like a function
of **it's** argument.

As someone who knows grammar, rekt. 




 But if you only connect to one node, then how do you know they don't have any hashpower? Your claim of no-trust needed is wrong. 




  And 5 minutes later someone adds a couple of blocks that includes the transaction mrEvil wanted to leave out. So you'd have to keep making a chain of only your blocks till the end of time to avoid that.

You only need to reject blocks with the transaction you wanted to exclude.

Which makes everyone else on the planet sooner or later stop using your chain, since its not distributed anymore and people will use the other 49%'s fork.

So you're saying a hardfork to stop this one chain. Everyone needs to upgrade, and anyone who didn't upgrade stays on my chain.

Also, in the time it takes, the attacker already successfully double-spent.

And this can be repeated, blocking any blocks that build on a competing fork, for as long as attacker has power. That builds an incentive to follow this attacker's proposed rules. 




  But the point is that standardization is not a "market". (Most things aren't.) There are no buyers and sellers, there is no item that gets traded and has a price.

It's not a perfect analogy to a market with fungible goods, but arguably markets don't need fungible goods (to take an example from the link above, selling dedications.) The buyer is anyone who burns, the seller is implicitly the entire bitcoin community, which gains because the float goes down. The item being traded is blocksize, with it automatically going to the highest bidder.

The purpose of a maximum block size limit (like the maximum size limit for internet packets) is to make it possible for each player to ensure before hand that he has enough resources to play his role. If the maximum block size is 1 MB, the admin of a site that needs to store 10000 blocks in memory knows that 20 GB of RAM will be more than enough. If the maximum block size is 20 MB, he had better get 200 GB, or program a more complicated solution with disk swaps or multiple servers. Now, what should he do if the maximum block size is computed from the traffic?

This may be a valid point, but note that "serious" proposals have been made with varying blocksizes as well. So some core devs don't seem to think that's a problem. 




  Having 51% allows no such thing, unless you are willing to compete with the rest of the network until the end of time, essentially forking it. Hoping that everyone will choose your more restrictive fork.

Your "restrictive" fork is longer than the other one, and is completely valid, therefore nodes will accept it. 














 Agreed, but it makes the above claim a lot less valid.

And there's still a chain of custody. 




 Roohparvar says the sleeves are thin enough to fit inside almost every battery compartment imaginable 




  A free market is not "anything can be sold". It is a market where there is no artificial barrier to the entry of new suppliers, suppliers can set the price of their product as they please, and customers can freely choose among suppliers.

That's not the meaning I was referencing. I'm talking about the idea that [If you may do it for free, you may do it for money.](http://bleedingheartlibertarians.com/2015/02/book-dedication-for-sale/) My (only partly in jest) claim was that the blocksize debate was not being conducted that way.

There's also the claim that the free market always works better than a non-free market.

Setting a common standard for products that have to interoperate -- like lamp and lamp sockets, power plugs and sockets, internet packet formats, character set encodings -- is not something that "free markets" are good at.

[citation needed]

(actually, since this is /r/bitcoin, even a citation won't be believed)

Whenever two computer systems have to share a database or exchange information, it is necessary to have a fixed maxmum size for items and messages.

This would still have a maximum size, just recalculated every so often, in a deterministic way. 




 But none of the "corrupt" agents had that access.

Do some research on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_of_custody 




 Are you saying you disagree? 









  OTOH Gavin has a point saying that a median always excludes the vote of the hash power minority.

I must have missed that. Link? 




 Buying paintings doesn't change the system. (And the money goes to others, who then spend it back into the economy. Not wasted.) 




  Having the most money means you can change the system to make sure you keep being the person with the most money sounds like a good idea to you?

Whoever controls 51% of mining can already control what is mined. The only thing about the system that could be changed under this plan is the blocksize. 




  Well, how about doing as Gavin proposed then, having the growing blocksize limit, BUT also making a very reasonable default adaptive soft limit, like 1.5x average since last 2016 blocks?

I've proposed this as well. You should use the median, not the mean, as someone pointed out.

I think more needs to be done on incentives, but that seems right.

Of course, [I prefer my own idea](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3863vw/a_brandnew_idea_for_resolving_the_blocksize_debate/) :) 




 There is no such thing as "almost surely guaranteed" in statistics.

Maybe I'm not the one who needs to study statistics more.
6 block in a row at some point.

But not starting from an arbitrary point. If I fork the blockchain starting from block X, 51% means I'll eventually be longer than the mainchain, while .01% means I most likely won't.

I can try forking anew whenever a new block is found, but that won't let me double-spend something from block X+1. 




 You've got an almost surely guarantee, or probability of 1, over unbounded time. 




 The logs on his computer couldn't be changed by someone with SR access. The journal, etc. 




 What do you think his appeal can be based on? 




 No. There's a petition site at whitehouse.gov, but change.org has no guarantee. 




 I think almost everyone will agree that he broke the law at this point. 




 The judge threw it out because he refused to claim a privacy interest in the server, which could not be used against him in court. 




 1. Make this on the whitehouse.gov website, if at all

 It's not only bandwidth, it's the UTXO set, which may grow a lot faster with larger blocks. 




 Just curious what you would consider a free market "anything can be sold" solution to this.

Or would actually using a burn address be enough? 




 But they need to waste it, not just give it to politicians. 




 FWIW, most of the sites I've used accepted a number other than 6.

And 51% is guaranteed in the long run. 




 It seems to be a definitional dispute over whether hardfork means network split or code change from a previously consistent state, and as the previous code was itself inconsistent, some aren't considering it a hardfok. Or maybe it's whether there's a protocol change or not?  




 So first of all, not everyone has a list of nodes like you do, and less nodes means less security for those.

Are you manually checking that you got valid responses from at least one known node, by the way?

Second, if everyone does like you, that puts the cost on those nodes even higher, leading to a disincentive for node to publicise their addresses. 




 That's a soft fork, I think. 




 Blocksize is sort of controlled like you say, but only if miners make a conscious decision. It's not as good a guarantee as the one against 50% attacks. 




 Your first point is very minor (no pun intended).

And a small miner must still verify a large block in order to mine on top of it; if they assume that others will be mining on it, they want to as well, but if it's large then they may not be able to store the blockchain anymore, or not have enough bandwidth for incremental changes. 




 6 is irrelevant to the attack.

And if you have less than 50%, you aren't guaranteed to suceed. 




 I've seen it said that bitcoin has never had a true hardfork; is that not true?

Edit: also, they seemed to be referring to when the limit was first introduced. 




 I'm on an i7, but I think it's in the 3s in GHz. Didn't time anything more than 5. 




 One of the agents (DEA agent Carl Mark Force) was the lead undercover agent in the case against Ulbricht, and had high-level access to administrative functions of the Silk Road, including the ability to manipulate logs, chats, private messages, posts, account information and bank accounts. 

And that somehow caused chat messages to appear on Ross's computer how exactly? 









 I like mine better. That one is both serious and unfree. They unfairly award more power to those with more money, without requiring them to pay it. That's not free markety at all! 




 There were no relevant hard-forks AFAIK, although there were some edge cases. 




 That was a soft fork. 




  Most scenarios predict that the winning fork is very quickly decided by market or other forces.

The last hard-fork caused by a bug took longer than "very quickly". 




 I'm thinking a new vote each retarget. However, if there's no opposition, then it takes very little to maintain/adjust. If there's opposition, then you need to outspend them.

(Perhaps there could be scripts as opposed to simply numbers, which would allow more freedom.)

The beauty of my idea is that it changes all future hard-forks to soft-forks; all miners just refuse to mine on ones with a bad vote, and nodes will **never** have to think about it again.  




 It worked for me, taking under a second for each result. 

for i in {1..5}; do echo xprv9wTYmMFdV23N21MM6dLNavSQV7Sj7meSPXx6AV5eTdqqGLjycVjb115Ec5LgRAXscPZgy5G4jQ9csyyZLN3PZLxoM1h3BoPuEJzsgeypdKj | bip32gen -i xprv -f - -o addr -F - $i; done

took 2 seconds to complete.

Try that, and if it works, then something's wrong with whatever key/code you copied. 




  How is the "huge block" problem any different than the 51% problem?

If you have less than 51%, you can't do a 51% attack (at least not with a certain chance of success). But any miner can start making huge blocks. 




 The problem is that some nodes will be hurt, and don't have the option to make these tradeoffs. 




  It would be great to have commitment that the core-devs and other stakeholders would abide by such a vote.

I was thinking that would be enforced by code. 




 And it's all done in the blockchain! 




 Just because it's hard doesn't mean we should make it even harder. There are real tradeoffs here, which you didn't acknowledge at all in your post. 




  We have full nodes surplus now, too many people are running full nodes. 

That is not true. The number of nodes has been dropping, and some core devs are concerned that it's going to be too low. 




 Disclaimer: this may or may not be serious; take it as you wish. If you do take it seriously, don't dismiss it as ridiculous. Conversely, if you think it's ridiculous, then it's probably satire.

As I'm sure you all know, there's been a debate recently over the blocksize. This is beginning to feel like politics. Bitcoin was made in order to subvert politics, so this is unfortunate.

The optimal solution for any problem whatsoever is a free market. This is proven by the [Coase theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coase_theorem), as any good anarchist knows.

The reason this hasn't solved the blocksize problem is that it's not a free market. Shocking, right?

**My proposal**

Make the blocksize a free market. Specifically, designate one address the "blocksize voting address", and disable spending any outputs to it. People can send any amount of bitcoin to this address, which effectively "burns" it. In such a transaction, also include an OP_RETURN with a number, which is your vote for the blocksize in bytes. These are averaged out every difficulty retarget, weighted by how much money was voted for them, and that is the new blocksize.

(I've tentatively selected an address for this: 1SizeQWexshCicTnfPmYESiAymjHyBXKX.)

Note that miners can reject transactions that have blocksize votes they don't want, so 51% of miners can easily collude to block voters they don't like. However, those voters can in turn make the fees to the miners high enough, which perfectly aligns incentives (ah, the magic words).

I had some buzzwords to put here, but I forgot, so pretend there was more things that you like about bitcoin here. 




  Then bitcoin must have been really big, really important. 

Or someone just spammed a lot.

Besides, nodes don't make money. 




  How can I verify that the child addresses are connected to the master key?

You can also print out the private keys by changing `addr` to `wif` and check that those generate those addresses. I'm not sure how else you want to verify.

 And what kind of wallet do I need to spend the bitcoins sent to these child addresses?

Any wallet that allows adding private keys. I don't have any wallet recommendations. Is the code good? 




  It suggests that my equipment is not catching up, and i'm not suitable to run a full node while other people and business can (they are forwarding it).

And when it costs a million dollars to run a full node due to large storage/ bandwidth requirements what will you do? 




 You spelled the fictional character wrong. 




 You aren't blocked, ergo the West is good. 




  then i have to accept that - that's what people want.

and then your node crashes because the block is too big.

Your claim that it only affects you if you want it to is false. 




 You can set your own soft limit and stop forward blocks bigger than that.

If you reject all blocks above a certain size, and others don't, you are breaking consensus.

You can't stay on the network without accepting everything other blocks do. 




  Not if I connect to specific nodes I trust along with other random nodes on the network.

They can also be targeted, though. And a situation where you need to distrust almost all nodes you don't know or aren't public isn't ideal, to say the least. 




 * Download https://github.com/jmcorgan/bip32utils `git clone https://github.com/jmcorgan/bip32utils`
* Run `cd bip32utils`
* Run `sudo python setup.py install`
* Run `for i in {1..1000000}; do echo xprvyourkeyhere | bip32gen -i xprv -f - -o addr -F - $i; done`

Tested in ubuntu and bash.

If you need the private keys, just change `addr` above to `wif`.

Changetip will be fine. 




 virwox.com, if you have a Paypal Mastercard you can use circle.com or coin.mx 




 But these all sound to me like issues that affect some, but not others. So it seems to me like it ought to be a configurable setting.

I can't opt out from the network if I run a full node. 




  Are you confusing nodes with miners? Having control of half of all nodes isn't some sort of magical number that'll allow you to do whatever you like. All it takes is one node to distribute a longer chain and it'll be accepted by all other legitimate nodes.

But you don't connect to all nodes. You only connect to some subset, and if I control half of all nodes you're likely to only connect to mine.

If I'm connected to several nodes that I trust, the likelihood that someone is going to compromise all of those nodes simply to double-spend against me seems lower than my chance at winning the lottery having never bought a ticket.

If running a node costs a lot, then you may not *know* people that run one. I personally probably know exactly 0 people who run nodes. 




 So if I'm responsible for $15 million of damage I don't owe any explanation, but if it's half a billion I do? 




 https://archive.is/LOBq3 




 Shouldn't you be in jail? 




 $15 million 




 If I've got any significant hashpower, I can convince you that I've sent you bitcoin with many confirms no matter where you start from.

I can also convince you that the chain is much smaller than it is without doing any work. 




 Sony getting hacked caused lots of damage, it was evaluated in the millions. 




 If you only visit a single node? Nope. 




 And if the network was reduced to only a handful of nodes, I imagine all of them would have public addresses. If you can connect to each of them, query for the same information, and get the same answer, is there any reason not to trust that answer?

It means that an attacker only needs to compromise a couple of nodes. It's less centralization.

Also, imagine there are 20,000 nodes. To be half the node network, you'd need 20,000 nodes of your own, and would need a lot of IP addresses.

But if there are only 25 nodes, then anyone can make another 25 nodes and be half the network. They can make 100 nodes with unique IPs, and be the vast majority.

Is this the only danger to worry about? That you might not have the longest chain? What issues could result of this?

It means someone could double spend. I send you chain X with a payment from me to you, so now you think you've been paid. The real chain Y already spent that payment somewhere else.

There's also a standard double-spend attack with preventing you from seeing the double-spend, but that only matters if you accept zero-confs. Even so, less nodes makes it easier to block.

Also, lower nodes means easier to censor, and harder to get cheap anonymity. 




 something reasonable such as 21 mb

If only everyone agreed that was reasonable ... 




 How many transactions do you do a day, how much do you pay in fees, and which currency would you switch to? You haven't provided enough info to be meaningful. 




 If you run your own node, then you have the full security of bitcoin as long as at least one node you connect to is honest. You can only be "fooled" into accepting a shorter chain if nobody that has the longer one can communicate with you. Also, if the fake chain is a lot shorter than the correct one, it will likely have very long gaps in between blocks, or the latest block will be far in the past, increasing suspicion.

If there are few nodes, then it's easier for someone to ensure that you connect only to them. 




 Nice try, Chinese. 




 http://lesswrong.com/lw/f1/beware_trivial_inconveniences/

The Great Firewall of China. A massive system of centralized censorship purging the Chinese version of the Internet of all potentially subversive content. Generally agreed to be a great technical achievement and political success even by the vast majority of people who find it morally abhorrent.

I spent a few days in China. I got around it at the Internet cafe by using a free online proxy. Actual Chinese people have dozens of ways of getting around it with a minimum of technical knowledge or just the ability to read some instructions.

The Chinese government isn't losing any sleep over this (although they also don't lose any sleep over murdering political dissidents, so maybe they're just very sound sleepers). Their theory is that by making it a little inconvenient and time-consuming to view subversive sites, they will discourage casual exploration. No one will bother to circumvent it unless they already seriously distrust the Chinese government and are specifically looking for foreign websites, and these people probably know what the foreign websites are going to say anyway.

 You shouldn't be reusing addresses [anyway](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Address_reuse).

You could just send away any coins on that address first before doing this.

(Also, the fact that you have other unspent transactions in the same address will make the procedure described above more complicated.) 




 You said it's a few dollars for a test.

But if you don't trust it, first generate the list of transactions using only your public address. Then, save the html file, go offline, generate the actual transaction, and save that. Then you can test it on blockchain.info before uploading it. That way, your private key is never entered while you're online.

You can't do it completely online because it needs to pull your transaction history. (By the way, I confirmed that transactions still pending are included on the list, so you can double spend with it.) 




 If you want to test it again I'll "help" you ... 




 Well, I knew immediately that the only hope to recover the funds is that a legit mining pool that has a policy for returning funds in such circumstances and that I can contact, mines the transaction.

You could also have quickly made another transaction and hoped the second went through (not very likely though). 




 404 




 User wallets won't let you double spend in general. You'll need to create the transaction manually, then broadcast it.

Assuming you have the private key:

1. Go to https://brainwallet.org/#tx

2. Paste in the private key

3. Put in the destination address

4. Put in the amount you want to send. This should be less than the total, to include a fee.

5. Copy the raw transaction, go to https://blockchain.info/pushtx, and paste.

 No no, you misunderstood. OP wants *more* threads, not less.

(I think the number of threads should dynamically increase with the number of people not paying attention; this makes an incentive for people to read them so that more aren't created.) 




 The increase of the block size should be dynamically adjust and it will be a benefit for both the normal user(faster confirmation speed)

No, that only applies if the blocks are full. 




 I'd recommend doing this with any site; I've been burned too many times by even so-called highly regarded sites.

Put it this way: have you ever seen an article from any mainstream source on something you knew a lot about, and found it completely accurate? I haven't, and many people have said the same. 




 What was stupid about what they did?

(In case you weren't aware, it was an app that stored private keys on the user's device, and had a problematic way to generate entropy. If you call anyone using the app stupid for not going through every line of source code themselves, including all of Android's source code, which was part of the bug, then you're setting a very high barrier which I highly doubt even you use. Or have you read the entire code of any wallet you use, plus any operating system it runs on?)

 Failures of Evidential Decision Theory, part 1. 
























 Your post only makes sense if the exchange doesn't have a full reserve. 




 Off-chain transactions do not imply fractional reserve. You can have full reserves and transact off chain. 




 If they had the cash, why wouldn't they be holding btc anyways? 




 If an exchange is doing that, we've got larger problems, and withdrawing in bulk will cause another MtGox, which is empirically bad for bitcoin price. 




 I don't see why you'd reject old version blocks after a hard fork.

Does the code Gavin published do that? 




 It doesn't matter if its blocks aren't accepted by the 90% chain, as long as the 90% chain's blocks are accepted by the 10% chain. 




  My point is not whether we want to do it or rather it is good, that is a whole other discussion. My point is that if the above-mentioned payment processors, with their infrastructure backing them, collude to do it, they can force it regardless of what the miners want.

If they were to completely fork bitcoin in a non-backward compatible way, and 50% of the miners wanted to stop it, they could just collude to attack the fork, with a standard 51% attack.

You can't do this without the miners. 




 That's actually the worst way to fork. If we don't have 50%, we don't want to switch. We also don't want to force miners to mine larger blocks. You could get around that by specifying some non-backwards compatible protocol change, but I don't see a strong reason for that (I haven't thought a lot about it, though.)

(And seriously, a hard fork isn't enough, you also want to break compatibility with smaller blocks?) 




 It has the nicest user interface that I've seen. I only use it for checking balances and tracing coins, wouldn't trust my money though. 




 The 10% chain would actually be shorter and not accepted. 




  If the exchanges agree among themselves, though, on going one fork and not the other, the mining pools can mine all they want, but whatever they mined/voided will be worthless.

That's only if the forks aren't compatible. As long as the 20MB nodes still accept 1MB blocks , and more than 50% of miners stay on the 1MB fork, there *is* no other fork.

The 1MB fork would win on both forks.

The claim "whatever they mined/voided will be worthless" is just wrong, unless the other fork is longer, which only happens if 50% of miners switch. 




 He could have only 20% of the miners go with him, the rest will follow in a few hours. It doesn't matter what the other devs think, the original chain will be relegated to back-alley-shady-altcoin status in no time.

If less than 50% of miners switch, there's no "longer" chain to switch to. The one with only 1MB or smaller blocks will always be longer. It will not become worthless.

There's a reason it's said that you need 51% to uphold a fork. 




 If less than 50% of miners switch, then the longer chain is the one with shorter blocks, and even exchanges that switched still support that.

I don't see any incentive for miners to switch just because all exchanges did.

Am I missing something? 




 Maya: 0. 




 I believe Google Wallet allows sending any amount, although to cash out you need at least $1. You could just transfer some from a bank and back if you really need the pennies, though. 




  Do you get paid to write such things? How does one talk about Snowden without talking about the NSA?

You're using my criticism of Snowden to imply that I approve of the NSA. That's wrong, and if you can't see why, we shouldn't talk about the NSA altogether.

You are using the same tactics as government shills by focusing on specifics part of the programs while avoiding talking about the parts that affect Americans.

I'm sure government shills also use English, that doesn't mean I'm one because I use English. Logical fallacy, again.

And of course it's against others countries laws for the US to spy on every country, the UN called the US out on that matter. To argue otherwise is intellectually dishonest.

Talk about intellectual dishonesty; the example you linked isn't about spying on other countries' citizens, it's about spying on protected international missions! That's illegal under international law (and therefore under US law as well, due to [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_Clause).)

Is that really a serious question?

Yes. You'd do well to take every point I make here seriously.

Do you really believe that any country would willingly allow foreign nationals to spy on them?

What a country allows and what is legal are two different things.

 In France for example they have "Loi Macron" that forbids such thing

As far as I can see this Loi Macron is something passed recently, within the last few months, for example http://www.thelocal.fr/20150410/france-gifted-but-lazy-loafing-pierre-gattaz and http://www.afrizap.com/en/france/. So it seems irrelevant, unless I'm missing something.

 there are other laws but I don't know them on top of my head and frankly this is a silly exercise .

I don't think it is. I think the question of whether the activities are illegal in other countries isn't that relevant to whether Snowden did the right thing by exposing them, but I also think some of them were legal, and if you know otherwise I'd like to hear your sources. 

For one source that says it is largely legal, see https://theconversation.com/i-spy-you-spy-we-all-spy-but-is-it-legal-20540.

I see your point, but when one starts with the insult before the argument, one looks silly, especially when the following argument is based on half-truths.

I don't think my argument was based on half truths.

Yet we learnt that Germany was aware, the chancellor appeared angry so its population would not get even more upset. One should not listen to what officials say, but what they actually do, and we know that the German spy agency helped the NSA.

That doesn't claim that the Germans knew the US was spying on *them*. They helped the US spy on other targets.

I highly doubt the Merkel knew that the US was tapping her cell phone, and your source does not claim that.

It's not a maybe, it's a clear yes, and the same is true of Americans.

For Americans, I have to decide if the good that was done by revealing the abuses outweighs the problematic parts of what he leaked. This is a very real tradeoff that is not solved by pointing to the parts that he leaked that *were* illegal programs. 




  I mean the collective value.

I still don't get what your argument is against my use of market cap. Explain what you mean by collective value, and why that has anything to do with my statement.

You may be arguing definitions. I'm arguing against what you are implying and against your method of argument in general. You have not actually elaborated on why your application of market capitalization to bitcoin is of any substance.

Someone above said something along the lines of "if bitcoin ever achieves any significant value, it will be easily attacked". The context was clearly saying that it's not being attacked right now because it's not worth enough.

So I responded by asking how it could be viewed as having no value now to attack, if the market cap is over 1 billion. Obviously an attack wouldn't pull out the whole market cap, but a successful exploit against bitcoin would probably be worth at least 1% of the market cap, which is still significant. There's also the point that as the price rises, the amount spent on mining also rises, which raises the cost for mining attacks.

I don't think that argument could be reasonably mistaken for the argument "bitcoin has a high market cap, therefore bitcoin=good", which I agree is ridiculous.

What the hell do you think a market cap of a volatile asset that crashes like a rocket pointing the wrong way if anyone actually tries to move some volume and has nothing to back it means, other than "this number is impressive".

It means that some portion of it is up for the taking should anyone have a real attack on bitcoin. Obviously you couldn't get the entire market cap, but some portion can be gotten. 




 I know what each word means separately, I don't get what you meant above by using both together.

Nope, that's the appeal to authority. Just because BoA does it doesn't mean it's right (unless foreclosing on the wrong house is right). They probably aren't misusing it as badly as you are in this case but the point stands.

You seem to misunderstand appeal to authority, and why it's a logical fallacy. We're not arguing over a factual matter, but a definitional matter. When arguing definitions, how it's used by people is a relevant form of evidence. You have yet to say what you'd consider evidence, or give any sources at all for your claim.

See http://skepdic.com/authorty.html, which lists the conditions that an appeal to authority is a fallacy.

I know you were trying to impress people. Stop pretending like you didn't throw "bitcoin" and "over a billion dollars" to make it seem important.

Well, if you can read my mind, why don't you comment on the brilliant rebuttal I'm thinking of right now?

Or more seriously, you *can't* read my mind, and apparently can't correctly infer people's intentions from their writing. The mention above was to disprove a claim. I have different things I mention when I want to impress people, but this sub is not where I try impressing people. 




 Some searching on collective value shows up only moral terms, not financial ones; could you link a definition?

Anyway, above I was told that market cap does not apply to bitcoin. Pointing out that people working in finance use the term should have been sufficient to disprove that.

 Your criticism seems to be different, and you seem to think I was trying to impress people, which is incorrect. 




 I was using it to rebut the claim that it hasn't achieved any real value.

Why do you think I'm misusing it? Nobody has supported that claim.

And how else should I respond to a claim that I'm using a word wrong, if not by showing that other people use the word that way? Again, what would be acceptable proof to you? 




 Well yeah, if you have access to the machine when the password is put in. Or if you hibernate without encryption. 




 /r/ilerminaty 




 You could just read the article, you know. He mentions a figure that he thinks is the maximum market cap, and uses the term market cap. 




 If the fact that someone from BOA is using it is not enough to show that I'm not foolish for using it as well, then what would? 




 I pointed out that the head of global rates and currency research at BOA applied the term market cap to bitcoin, and they presumably know what the term means.

 I don't actually see this link elsewhere in /new, and the article is only 2 hours old. 









  With all transactions ending up in the blockchain, the only way to guarantee anonymity would be both purchasing and selling your bitcoins outside of any system which requires identification.

Actually, you can mix your coins after you get them, and end up with anonymous coins. 




 I'm pretty sure it is.

A quick search turns up [this](https://tbtc.blockr.io/trivia/block), can't be bothered to find a more official source now. 




 A block can't have no transactions in it, that may be the source of your confusion. 




 If you're using a computer they provide, and an operating system they provide, and there's malware on it, then yes.

If you use your own OS (say, Live Linux USB), or your own laptop, then they can't see what you're doing on Tor, or any good VPN.

They can see you're connecting to them, but not where you go.

There are ways to block that as well; see Tor bridges. 




  Do you have any idea how common it is for companies to install custom certs to track their users?

No idea. Any large company that cares will do it, it's easy if they set the computer up. 




  Can they raise the issue of how the server was found and the fruit of the poisoned tree?

They already raised it and the judge pointed out the problem with the request. I doubt that could go through on as a basis for appeal.

How about Ross' experts being blocked from testimony and that the journal and screenshots could have been total fabrication?

They'd have to show why the judge was wrong in denying the testimony (for being filed too late.)

You can't just repeat old arguments in an appeal, you need new ones.

For the "faked screenshots", they'd need to argue against the agents that testified for its credibility, which is different from the corrupt agents.

Again, doubt an appeal has much basis unless there are new arguments.
Finally, do the indicted federal agents' crimes play a part in this appeal?

As nothing connected to them was brought up in the trial, again, unlikely.

  Or, maybe it is not up to the person defending all the relevant experiments done by all serious scientists ever, to have to replicate whatever ridiculous setup ginned up by a guy on youtube.

 The first link says

The subject was later popularized in a famous 1962 article in the journal Nature, which described an experiment in which all other forces to the system were removed by filling a 6 ft (1.8 m) tank with 300 U.S. gal (1,100 L) of water and allowing it to settle for 24 hours (to allow any movement due to filling the tank to die away), in a room where the temperature had stabilized. 

The second one is talking only about sinks and toilets as far as I can tell.

  PRISM collects all internet communications from US citizens, this is a clear breach of the The Fourth Amendment of the US constitution and the Bill of Rights which guarantees privacy and prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures.
 Your comparison of a US citizen calling Google and demanding their data of other countries makes no sense, you're just trying to whitewash what the NSA did.

I did no whitewashing. We're talking about Snowden now, not the NSA. It's a logical fallacy to say that because I think Snowden did some wrong things, that I think the NSA is right in what *they* did. I don't.

Now, whether it's a "clear breach" is debatable, legal experts have said otherwise, but that's not the point here. I'm talking about PRISM spying on other countries' citizens. You said it would be against other countries' laws, which I denied. So I asked you to list which law it would break, and you didn't answer.

An ad hominem is when you attack someone's character rather than their argument, there is no place for such place for such puerile attack if one wants to be taken seriously.

You've made some personal attacks on me yourself, but no matter.

The ad hominem fallacy is when you say "that guy is stupid, therefore he is wrong". When you say "that guy is wrong, for reasons X, Y, and Z, therefore he is stupid", that's not ad hominem.

See http://laurencetennant.com/bonds/adhominem.html

So your issue with Snowden is the fact that he let foreign states know about the capabilities of the US? But we know that these states (like Germany, France, Britain, etc..) knew about the program, they were part of it. So it was no surprise to these governments, in effect Snowden didn't disclose anything other foreign agencies didn't already, what he did was to let citizens know about the abuse of power by our Governments, and for that he should be thanked.

First of all, not all states knew about US spying on them. Germany in particular got very upset with the US for spying on them; if you're conspiracy minded you could dismiss that as fake anger, but I doubt it.

what he did was to let citizens know about the abuse of power by our Governments, and for that he should be thanked.

If you're a non-us citizen, then maybe. And I do think leaking any of the illegal programs (under US law/constitution) is fine, and I'll thank him for that. The problem is those documents he leaked, that did not describe anything illegal. I don't see how the fact that other countries may have known about them makes it any better.

Again, if someone were to publically reveal a weapon that your government had been developing against other countries, would you thank them? If no, then Snowden deserves no praise from Americans for the programs involving spying on other countries that he revealed. 




 Thanks for that. 




  The largest mining pool posted on the bitcoin developers mailing list the other day and said 20MB blocks were more than they could handle.

First of all, let's [link to the actual post](http://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/mailman/message/34157036/)

That says it's more than they can handle now, they want to to increase smoothly. Right now there's no need for such big blocks, but developers are worried about the future, and supporting more.

Anyway, I was talking here about what would happen if 20MB blocks were common, that's not going to happen for a while.

Greg Maxwell has said that most of the ghash hashrate drop off after the 51% scare was CEX moving their hashrate to other pools to hide it. This apparently happened after a meeting with all the big mining players, and is likely being done by other large operations specifically to make it appear that everything is fine.

This is a larger concern. I'm not sure if he said "most", though, what I recall is that "some" was hidden. 




 It is negligable to toilets, kiddy pools and sinks.

That source doesn't mention that at all. 




  The Bitcoin "market cap" is a bullshit metric that is there to make you feel a bit better (or not), it is not a market cap.

I may be stupid, but I could probably become their "head of global rates and currencies research", because apparently that doesn't require knowing what market cap means. 




 Could you elaborate on that?

 If you had even a single result that contradicted theirs while being as controlled as theirs was then you'd disprove their experiment as not being strong enough. Surely there's a 50% chance of that if you're right?

And what about the MIT paper they cited and claimed it shows that the effect can be detected? 




 Just remember, in an alternate universe there's someone who saved two kids today.

There's also someone who posted "TIFU by not wearing contacts and letting two kids get killed by a car".

Multiverses are fun. 




 At the risk of sounding childish: could you try doing it and making your own video?

I'm somewhat sympathetic to the idea that criticism of something should be within an order of magnitude of the original in rigor or higher. If someone makes a video of an experiment, the rebuttal should feel like it took a similar amount of effort.

  No it isn't, there is no country in the world that allows spying by foreign nationals, none.

What crime would a US citizen be committing by calling up google and demanding their data on other countries, as in PRISM? What country says that is illegal for someone to do?

What crime is being committed by passive collection of data that goes through internet cables?

This opinion piece is quite bias, the author starts his essay with a ad hominem which shows his lack of argumentation

Ad hominem is when you don't include arguments, they did include them. I in fact quoted one.

I would consider them a defector, but we all know that the spying on all Americans is illegal and go against the Constitution, that the government was able to extend the law to fit their needs is not surprising, but it doesn't make its actions any more legal, at least constitutionally.

Again, my problem is with his exposure of spying on other countries, which is certainly legal under US law, if not those countries laws.

I'm amazed that people like you defend the spying on Americans.

Don't be, because I didn't defend that. 




  just plain stupid.

Goldman Sachs does not employ stupid people. 




  Even more importantly, because the only response variable was flow direction, and if there's an equal chance systemic bias leads to either flow directions, there's a fully 25% chance that this result does NOT support the Coriolis hypothesis.

That's only *if* there was a systemic bias on both sides. You need to multiply the chance of having a systemic bias in the first place. 




 https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#decodescript says you can use bitcoind to do it.
 




 Your sarcasm detector is broken. 




 So what's the difference between what they did and the MIT claim, or is MIT wrong? 




  Lol please. Calling bitcoin a currency while saying it has a 3 billion dollar market cap is laughable at best.

I didn't call it a currency. You were the one who said "any popularity or value", which it clearly does possess. There's enough incentive to attack it.

In fact your claims are nothing more than bullshit which can easily be debunked by comparing bitcoins value with number of nodes. As bitcoin gained value mining centralized, and the number of nodes decreased. This isn't "something I've said a couple of times". This is exactly what happened from 2013 to 2015.

There are other factors, in particular the ability to use bitcoin without running a node, pools coming into existence (and solo mining not being practical), ASICs coming out which made mining something you needed a new device for. All of those are one-time events, that wouldn't effect what would happen if the price rose even higher. If you'd like to do a more careful analysis that controls for those factors somehow, I'd love to see it. But as it is, what you're saying only shows correlation where we have several other confounders that may be the cause.

Yes yes, that will be fixed in the future. Like every other gaping bitcoin problem.

This is code already in github, which will be released after testing. See https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/f9ec3f0fadb11ee9889af977e16915f5d6e01944 




 But that doesn't matter, the points he makes and the math he shows are sound regardless of that the person calls themselves.

I can't judge whether the math is right.

They got results despite the math.

That's not what they say. They cite a paper that did the same experiment, which they claim goes through the math and shows it is possible. Again, I can't evaluate their math either, but they aren't saying it should be impossible but we did it anyway. 




  Currently bitcoin is partially decentralized. Bitcoin is such an obscure libertarian play toy that it's decentralized enough to remain secure. If it ever gained any popularity or value, the current decentralization would not be enough to stop it from being attacked.

How can you call something with a market cap of over 1 billion as not gaining value?

If there was enough motivation all you would have to do is convince 3 people in the world and you have control of the majority of the hashing power.

I've said this as well a couple of times. I do think that if bitcoin went significantly up in value, there would be substantially more nodes, and mining would decentralize more.

Also, those 3 people (and in reality, it's 3 companies, which hopefully have multiple people that would need to be compromised) would gain a lot quickly, but would then lose a lot of mining power as miners switched to a different pool. I also think that if the price goes up, miners will have more incentive to switch to smaller pools, because of the very same incentive for attackers.

Do the math, 20mb blocks = 1 TB of dice game spam added to the bloat chain every year. How many people are going to purchase multiple TBs of disk space and give up all of their bandwidth to run a node?

There have been proposals. Note that pruning will allow for the vast majority of the blockchain to be discarded. 




  This subreddit was created to mine Comedy Gold, and to laugh at you.

The sub was created before I owned any bitcoin or knew anything about them, so you're endorsing retrocausality.

(The above argument has about the same epistemological quality as your own.)

We don't even need to say anything to convince reality that Butts are done for.

If you don't want to engage with the other side's argument, that's your right, just don't pretend you're interested in doing so.

 They become more and more irrelevant every day.

What metric are you using irrelevant as a proxy for?

We never seek to convince you or anyone else, only to amplify the already-substantial laugh yield.

What can I say that would make you laugh? 




  That was basically done in the original post (the one with the math and theory) and the response it got is basically "try it yourself"

He doesn't claim to be a physicist.

Never let the ideal textbook calculations or simulations get in the way of empirical data. I test for a living. I learned this my first week on the job 13 years ago.

Which is just.... terrible.

I agree. OTOH, they also mentioned a paper that agreed with them on the math, so either one paper is wrong, or misinterpreted, neither of which I have the expertise to judge. 




 Because the other paper didn't seem to be addressing the exact same question, and it seemed to be the commenter who was interpreting it. 




 I can't evaluate his claims, but he does cite a paper and claim he replicated it. His results by himself might not be enough, but if the experiment was already done, I'd give him the benefit of the doubt.

OTOH, the other side has a paper as well. Maybe we should ask a physicist. 




  3 mining pools control 50% of the hash rate. If that's not centralized I don't know what is.

If that's the case, then your claim above that increasing the blocksize to 20MB and it being full would destroy centralization is false. Either it's currently decentralized in whatever sense you're talking about, or it isn't, but not both at the same time.

I honestly don't know why bitcoiners come here and try to wage some holy war trying to debate us. We don't care about your ponzi scheme, and you sure as hell aren't going to convince us that you are right. 

If you just want to laugh without caring if you're right or not, be my guest. The sidebar said this tries not to be an echo chamber, but I guess there's only so much you can do.

How can you say you don't care when this entire subreddit was set up to talk about bitcoin?

When you guys come here, all you do is get your panties in a twist, spout off some talking points, and then walk away with your head held high because you just "won".

How is that description any different than what you're doing? 




  Of course not, but it's illegal under US laws for other countries to spy on the US and vice versa, hence spying is illegal.

It's more complicated than that. Hacking would be illegal, but simply grabbing data from cables, or intercepting it when it comes into the US might not be.

What programs are you referring to?

http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/edward-snowden-is-no-hero

These were legally authorized programs; in the case of Verizon Businesss phone records, Snowden certainly knew this, because he leaked the very court order that approved the continuation of the project. So he wasnt blowing the whistle on anything illegal; he was exposing something that failed to meet his own standards of propriety. 

[Here's another list](http://www.forwardprogressives.com/let-me-show-why-edward-snowden-traitor-not-patriot/)


If someone would reveal that the CIA is spying on other countries, would you consider them a hero, if it was completely legal under US law? Or would you consider them a defector? 




 Both sides quoted papers. Your "actual scientist" reference is ridiculous, as well as the "verifiable". Both cited "actual scientists", and the experiment is also verifiable. 




  Miners went from hundreds to dozens to 8

[citation needed]

It could be you're talking about mining pools, but that doesn't mean the mining itself is centralized, and they could easily move to a different pool.

nodes went from 20,000 down to 5800

Which qualities are lost by a descent from 20000 to 5800? How much further would be required for another loss of qualities?

I think most of that was right after SPV was released and you didn't have to run a full node to use bitcoin.

 You said something about doing Bayesian statistics wrong, you never did any calculations. You complained about moving goalposts when my argument is the same as I started with. When you make those kind of accusations, it's on you to support them. 




  lol then your number is 10% not 1, stop moving the goalposts.

What's your complaint? I laid out clearly what each of my numbers meant.

Right, only on ones where someone can afford to bribe them with a lot of money like this one

There's little motive here for bribery, it's either suicide or accident. Doesn't change my priors.

You still don't seem to be understanding how the statistics work in this scenario: both the cops and family members are faced with a single case

They are. You aren't explaining very well how I'm getting the statistics wrong. I laid out a calculation, what's wrong with it?

You aren't addressing my point. 




 "More crooked cops" would be true, because 1/10 would be crooked. My point is that even a crooked cop doesn't lie on every case, and once you take that into account, the proportion of crooked cops lying on any given case should be lower than the equivalent by family members. 




 Use ublock 




 The prior on the cop lying in this instance would be 1%, and the family member would be 4%.

I had a typo above, sorry, you have a point.

My original comment still seems correct. Even if you believe the proportion of cops who would lie on some cases is higher than the proportion of family members who would lie, the proportion of cops who actually lie on a given case is lower than those who would lie on some case, but a family member has a much greater incentive to lie. After all, they're involved in the case.

 




 http://hashingit.com/analysis/33-7-transactions-per-second

says the same, and it's from 2014. 




  A perfectly full 20mb block of transactions would net bitcoin a grand total of 56 transactions per second and it would lose most of its decentralized qualities.

Why? I know decentralization would go down, but I don't think it would be by that much. 









 Why not?

Making up some numbers, if the chance a cop is crooked is 1 in 10, the chance a crooked cop lies on any given case is 1 in 10, and the chance a random victim family member is crooked and lying is 1 in 25, then the family member has a 4 times lower prior of telling the truth than the cop does.

Edit: meant to say higher prior of lying.

Edit: They auctioned 130,000, I think: just an extra $150 on average from each is enough to cover that.

Further edit: they seized much less than 700,000, apparently only 174,000 or so. The question is whether Ross still has access to the rest.

 




  of course spying is illegal but everyone does it

It's not illegal under US laws to spy on other countries. That's what the entire CIA is there for, basically.

It may be illegal under the other countries' laws, but someone revealing that one government is breaking the laws of a different government is generally called a traitor.

the biggest issue which Snowden uncovered was the scale of the spying, and the fact that the US spies on everyone including its own people which is a sign of authoritarian tendencies especially since it was done in secret and most likely against the US Consititution

If all he'd done was reveal illegal spying, I wouldn't have a problem. He revealed many programs that were completely legal, yet classified, and many programs that were against other countries, also legal under US law.

 Sort of, although that can be obscured as well, using Coinjoin. That basically means that multiple users all send in a merged transaction, so there's no way to tell which one owns which. There's code to do that at https://github.com/chris-belcher/joinmarket

But what I was describing is different. Basically, you send bitcoin to a site that has a large "pool" of bitcoin, and they send different ones back to another address you own. So only that site knows which coins were which. If they delete logs (like they claim to), then nobody can tell even after the fact. There's one at https://bitmixer.io/index.html

 Reminded me of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb_-a9I_fto 




 reproduce the content

That's arguably questionable, if you take that to mean "copy it to our own servers". Google's webcache [was ruled fair use](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2006/01/google-cache-ruled-fair-use), but I can see arguments that this would be different; the guidelines mentioned in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_v._Google,_Inc.#Fair_use don't all apply.

That said, reading through that page does make one think it would be legal, as the blog post says:

 After all, having an RSS feed in the first place is an implict opt-in to that sort of thing. But trying to dictate terms on top of that while telling me that I automatically agree to them unless I opt out is unacceptable, even if the terms themselves are relatively benign.  




 On his part, or on Apple's part? 




 The problem isn't with the terms, it's that Apple *assumes you agree if you don't say anything*! I'm sure the blog author agrees Apple can demand anything they want in exchange for listing. But considering someone to have agreed to terms when they're silent is silly, and will never hold up in court.

You're basically agreeing to take responsibility for your own content.

Apple is *assuming* you agree, and in order to disabuse them of this notion you must do an action. That's what's unacceptable. 




 Apple doesn't have to be responsible, but they have no right to demand the original author defend them. The original author made no guarantee to Apple.

It'd be the same as trying to sue your RSS reader of choice for something from my blog that you read and didn't like.

An RSS reader that runs on device is different, because the developer doesn't store it.

A better analogy would be if Google would index my site without my agreement (with an "opt-out" clause), then sues me because they got a takedown notice.

If the argument is that Apple shouldn't be responsible for the content, that's *their* job to make that argument in court, not mine.

Again, it's fine to put whatever you want in your terms and require people to agree if they want to use your service, but you have no right to demand people agree with your terms in general, and assume they agree unless they opt-out. 




  He is attacking Apple for being transparent. That is ridiculous.

He's attacking them for assuming he agrees to whatever they want if he doesn't opt-out.

The terms state

 If we receive a legal claim about your RSS content, we will tell you so that you can resolve the issue, including indemnifying Apple if Apple is included in the claim.

Do you know what indemnify means, and why someone might not want to agree to it?

They give you a "Letter of Guarantee" signed by their address, so if they ever scam anyone there would be cryptographic proof. So as long as nobody produces a Letter of Guarantee that hasn't been fulfilled, they probably aren't scamming anyone.

(As I understand it, the letter basically says "if btc is sent to addressX by timeY, we will send Z% to addressX2 by timeY2, with limits such and such". So you can see in the blockchain if it's been fulfilled or not.)

 I'm not disputing that right now spam can dos the network.  My claim is that there are viable solutions to that. If blocksize isn't limited, but almost everyone needs to pay around the actual costs, then spammers are just paying for miners and nodes to get larger hard drives.

I'm not claiming you can make spammers happy, just that you can make anyone we care about happy. 




 The spammer can't win, but why can't the miners and nodes win, and the legit user pay a nominal fee? That subset is all the designers should care about, and they are not zero sum.

  That's the reason I haven't had to bother to look at the proposals, just as I wouldn't bother to read your interesting exercise on how to square the circle or solve the traveling salesman problem in polynomial time.

The difference is that for squaring the circle, there are mathematical proofs that it's impossible, and for P=NP, most experts believe otherwise, and there's a [whole lot of people claiming proofs](https://www.win.tue.nl/~gwoegi/P-versus-NP.htm). (That page also links to http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~oded/p-vs-np.html which says why he won't check such claimed solutions.)

This "problem" of DoS that you mention has neither rigorous mathematical proof of its impossibility, nor a consensus among academic experts of the same. It's therefore incorrect for you to make the comparison.

Now, as for the actual problems you've brought up:

The government would pay to enlarge the mined block up to its limit. That's what a DoS is. The limit can be "variable" but it can't be infinite, as otherwise mempools will fill up on nodes everywhere in the network.

Nobody's talking about making it infinite (which is impossible to do without computers capable of relaying infinitely large blocks.) THere's been talk of dynamically increasing limits based on averages of past blocks, which would only be able to grow at a fixed rate even if spam was introduced.

Aligning the incentives so that miners profit when spammers engage in spamming has nothing to do with the incentives for people just trying to pay someone using Bitcoin.

That's right; currently, the incentives aren't sufficiently aligned. The miners' incentives are aligned the right way, as in they won't be forced into doing something they don't want. What we need is some kind of incentive for nodes that sufficiently rewards them for their costs. If that was implemented, then spamming would just increase funding for the costs it creates, thus being a wash.

It isn't only a 2-party problem no matter how much you try to simplify it, and not everyone can have their interests aligned to when some of the interests are diametrically opposed.

Can you prove this mathematically? Which people are in a zero-sum situation (which I'm assuming is what you mean by "diametrically opposed")? Anyone wanting Bitcoin to survive automatically has a shared interest with anyone else who also does, so the only possible zero-sum seems to be enemies of Bitcoin versus non-enemies. This part of your argument isn't so clear.

  a 10$ kiddy pool setup done in a few minutes can be used to demonstrate the effect.

Don't see the claim that it take only a few minutes. 




  Look, I said the effect it negligible and plays no role when it comes to "toilets, kiddy pools and sinks".

Yes, and so far you have yet to source the pools part.

Now you want to talk about pools? Do I have to find a source that says the effect does not matter to green kiddy pools after that?

The original claim was **only** about pools. There's been no goalposts moved, despite what you seem to be implying.

You don't have to learn physics, just to be able to understand the wikipedia article on the coriolis force enough to know that the size and duration of the system are what matter here. Educating yourself on the strength of the coriolis force does not require more of you than to look it up!

And the size is larger, so your sources are worthless for the question here. 














 SPV nodes have no way for example to detect if a node fraudulently reports the receipt of bitcoins to the SPV nodes wallet that dont exist in the fully-verified block chain.

That's actually stupidly easy to check; download all the headers, verify those, and download the block that transaction is supposed to be in.

I think the real problem is the reverse: that they could withhold transactions, and without scanning the whole blockchain you wouldn't know about these missing transactions.

E. A change would be irreversible - Changing the block size limit requires a hard fork and if the larger block size were to be abused, changing it back may not be possible due to changes in who would still be mining without coersion from outside organizations. 

Changing it back would require just 51% of miners and nothing else. It's easier than changing it in the first place, which requires nodes to upgrade. 




  Elevier charges too much. Most publishers do.

That seems like even less of a legal argument. 




 You seem extremely convinced of your position, despite being unwilling to look at the proposals that would solve the problem. Why is that?

Finding ways to easily filter out spam if someone should choose to pursue DoS is a governance problem, but as soon as you have guys like Gavin deciding which people (or bots) are and are not allowed to get their transaction into the blockchain, you've just added government into Bitcoin.

Miners will individually decide which transactions they allow. If they're fine with a transaction, then it can hardly be called spam, can it? If some government wants to pay for the miners' costs, that just lowers the price for the rest of us.

The important things that need to be done (and are starting to be addressed with technical proposals) are aligning the incentives better, so that the same people who'd be paid by spammers are the ones the cost falls under, for example. Do you think that's impossible, and if so, why?

Ironically the actual banking systems in use in the world are decentralized in execution in a way that Bitcoin is not. I can deposit money in a local bank without having to have the transaction wait a turn in line on a global transaction clearing scheme before the local bank could treat that deposit as an asset.

If your bank trusts you, you could use something like Ripple or Lightning network to deposit bitcoins there instantly. Or if they trust your exchange, they can greenaddress their addresses and deposit instantly also. 




 You seem to both lack enough imagination to solve the problem and are unwilling to read the proposals.

If you could actually point to an analysis that showed that the network was vulnerable to Dos and that none of the proposed solutions are viable, that would be a different story. 

centralized blockchain 

Wat? 




 Yes, yes, we know about hindsight bias. 




 That's completely irrelevant. 




  It won't be. If it is it will just be the target of DoS attacks, which is why the initial blocksize limit was instituted in the first place! You do know that Bitcoin wasn't born with a 1MB blocksize limit, right?

There have been proposals. You can go read them.

Yes, I know it didn't start with a 1MB limit. The cost for spamming was also much less when bitcoin was worth less.

Are you being deliberately obtuse now?

No. I was trying to explain my earlier comment on how your argument seemed circular. I get how you responded to that, but I disagreed, as above.

This isn't a difficult concept and it's not something you should pawn off on the Great Developers running their Tons of Simulations. You should strive to understand what is going on yourself instead of just leaving things in the hands of people smarter than you.

The concepts we're talking about now are much more difficult than you give them credit for. I've done a lot of reading, there are dozens of different technical proposals at this point.

If you can't imagine a variable blocksize that isn't vulnerable to Dos, maybe you should read some of those proposals. 




 What kinds of fees are we talking about?

 But when **transaction** fees go up

I know we're talking about transaction fees, I mean numerically how high.

Yes, if usage increases then fees have to go up. Even Bitcoin isn't immune to supply and demand, and remember that you're the one assuming the 20MB blocks are already filled up. If the number of transactions you can fit in a block is fixed, and more people want to push transactions into the blockchain, the price of each transaction must go up until there is equilibrium between transaction demand and transaction supply again.

If the blocks are completely full, then sort of. But what if the max blocksize is variable, and expands if more transactions show up? (And yes, it's more complicated than that, which is why there are developers running tons of simulations to try and figure out what's best to do.)

Fees go up - less tumblers used - tx volume goes down (since non-bot volume can't increase to match what computers could put on the blockchain).

Why do the fees go up in the first place? And remember, these fees are starting at 1/20th of the current fees, assuming 20MB blocks. 




  I'm not saying that no one is paying for the privilege. Criminals pay hefty fees to launder money in fiat, after all. But when transaction fees go up as you have the moon-rocketing masses on their way to Satoshi's Comet, fewer people will use tumblers and transaction volume will then go back down. 

What kinds of fees are we talking about? If usage increases, the fees don't go up over today's implied fees in the subsidy (again, assuming constant price+hashrate), they go down.

What you're describing as inevitable doesn't seem so to me, because there's so many things you're handwaving (fees go up - less tumblrs used - fees go up? Circular?) 




 No such thing as bad publicity. 




 But how are those any less legitimate than others? Tumblrs perform a service, and get paid for it, and so on.

But look yourself, pegged against a stable reference point you can see that transaction volume has been flat... for months.

I'm not sure USD value is a good peg, because often a transaction is for much less than the amount actually transferred. If an exchange has a hot wallet around a constant size of btc, then USD value will fluctuate regardless of actual transfer size. 




  since most transactions are artificially constructed anyways.

As opposed to? Seriously, I'm not sure what you mean. Almost every transaction is created by a computer, yes. But I doubt most transactions are made not for the purpose of transferring money. There's been some stress tests (and spam) recently, but I don't think that accounts for a majority? 




 I think the phrasing in OP was poor.

20MB blocks isn't going to magically fix that.

Well yeah, but 20MB blocks plus increase in transaction volume will, and the whole point in 20MB blocks is because people expect transaction volume to increase. 




  But that's analogous to asking "why do I have to pay my barber to move those scissors around my head (when I can do it myself)?" or "why do I have to pay my employees to push keys on a keyboard (when I can do it myself)?".

Possibly; but that doesn't make the complaint wrong. I complain about Windows charging for upgrades, and use mostly Linux myself, where I get completely free upgrades. (And I do like that Windows 10 will be freeish for some time.)

Is my complaint that Windows costs somehow wrong?

Perhaps he's simply demanding that people give him free stuff.

Or stating that he's going to use the free stuff from other vendors. 




 How is it not a feature? 




 If there aren't more transactions, then there can't be 20MB blocks (well, barring much larger transactions).

each 20 MB block has the same number of transactions per block as is happening today

That's impossible (again, barring huge transactions, but those are likely to represent multiple "real" transactions ala Coinjoin). 




 Well yeah (although with some of recent stress tests they were), but a main reason given to raise the blocksize is that blocks are expected to fill up with greater adoption.

I feel your post is a bit disingenuous. It implies that the cost would be the same regardless of volume, esp. that part about how larger blocks wouldn't fix it. What would be more accurate is that *if* the price stayed the same *and* volume stayed the same, then the cost would remain the same.

I think you should clarify that your calculations are assuming transaction volume doesn't increase. 




 Yeah, 20MB blocks isn't going to magically fix that. 

Could you elaborate on that? Assuming hashrate and price remain constant, increasing blocksize by 20X would cause the price per transaction to go down by roughly 20X as well. 




 I'm not sure if you can call that foreshadowing; it was a blatant riddle. 














 Hey, just read my comment again and the replies to it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/396irq/lpt_how_to_remove_get_windows_10_icon_permanently/cs1owl9). 




 I already answered that in the other thread. 




 They are in a sense, but then those aren't hard to pick through, it says right in the title of the update. Besides, you can just allow all "important ones", which pretty much is only security updates. 




 Nobody's asking you to buy it, it's free. 




 As an American, I'm not sure what this is about but you're so wrong. 




 Um, bitlocker was around in Win7 as well? 




 So why not switch back to the beta? 




 Copy the game files, run DOSBox. 




 I don't know where you got that 99% figure.

A lot of updates are just security updates, meaning you'll never actually notice any differences. The rest are usually for obscure programs or edge cases, like other languages.

I'd say that less than 5% of updates are even noticeable. 




 So sex with a poor prostitute is rape? 




 Hate to be THAT guy (actually I love it), but that should read "my friend and I". 




 Yes, but how many people would they have working on this? And how well do those people knw bitcoin? And if you generate new addresses, you need to communicate them whenever someone asks, while a single address (or even many static ones) could be shared among followers.

Note that some ransomware bitcoin demanders reused addresses, when that's a much larger problem. 




 It's rather common for fundraising to just list an address for donations. Otherwise you need to generate a new address on demand, which requires running a server and custom code. 




 Not flipping a switch is because of electricity. 




 But How Can Blocks Be Full If Spam Isn't Real

 Unless some are reusing addresses, likely for fundraising. 




 If you write a detailed and convincing blog post with good data, you should be able to get it picked up. If you can pay you can make an actual press release as well. 




 Let me get this straight: you think it's possible that it is used for terrorism, but if so that fact should be hidden? 




 Sounds like I've got some fun times ahead. That seems like a good start, thanks. 




  OP obviously means "Why do I have to pay a fee to you, if I use the pre-built binaries or source code without modifications".

Is that not how other people took it? 




 How about instead of whining on reddit about it, you do some research and write a report on exactly how much is being raised compared to total volume and other methods of funding, then send that to the relevant people (press release, etc)? 




 Can you use Multibit HD without paying the fee? If not, that counts as being unable to turn it off without stopping to use the program.

I'm also not sure if the wallet seed is compatible with other wallets. 




 It would take exactly the same time for mine vs Multibit HD. Besides, for some it will be a matter of principle. 




 I'm assuming Multibit's build process is well-documented; if not, should be fun to play with and figure it out. 




 Their funding model is legit. The complaining is legit as well.

Including a "feature" that most users will not want and not allowing it to be turned off (except by forking) is not user-friendly.

It's similar to the uTorrent Bitcoin mining problem in that regard. 




 Article makes some big conclusions with out really providing any evidence to support them

Welcome to the media. 




 The (forked) source would also be available, and people could build it themselves. I mean, the same question can be asked for any binary of open source code.

I'm thinking of something akin to Iceweasel, which changes almost nothing about the original code but the name. 




 I think I'll just host the binaries on Github. 




 Anyone interested in a fork that just removes this, and I guess changes the name and removes any communication with Multibit servers? 




 iirc there was testimony that the wallet was found on his computer.

He also agreed that the coins found on his computer were his, when he agreed to the government auctioning them off. 




 I know some people have done it, definitely for earlier versions of OSX. Haven't kept up with recent developments. 




 I suggest you enlighten *yourself* by reading the transcript of the trial, which introduced evidence for him ordering them.

The best his defense could do was claim he didn't mean them. No explanation for all the bitcoins paid from his wallet, though. 




 I don't know.

You're supposed to have the source code. It depends on how it's implemented; if you get some kind of certificate that signs the app, then you probably could sign an app even without the source. If you build it, then upload to Apple to sign, the question is how they know who actually built it. 




 That's a much weaker claim than OP. Of course, as both nodes and miners need to upgrade, if all nodes upgrade then only (51% of) miners will need to. 




 As a tumblr user with like 10 blogs and a couple hundred followers, your number is wrong. There are normal people on tumblr who aren't trolling. 




 There was a post on that recently on the frontpage of Hacker News, try searching for virtualbox there in the last month and see. If I wasn't on mobile I'd do it myself. 




 That exploit is long fixed, only works on old IOS versions. 




 Use Virtualbox/VMware. 




 It takes one guy an hour to change the fork so it only allows 1MB blocks that are compatible with all nodes. If 50% do not want larger blocks, they can upgrade to this fork.

All miners mining 1MB blocks will get orphaned automatically, so there's actually a strong inventive not to mine those.

I don't think you've thought through the incentives here. A miner upgrading to the new 1MB fork is just like a miner staying on the same software if the fork is backwards compatable. 




 Looks like you'll be able to install custom apps with only an Apple ID now, no dev membership required. 




 Hold my press, I'm 

linky? 




 51% of miners could easily upgrade to the new version, then enforce 1MB blocks, which would be the same as preventing the fork. 




 There don't seem to be any new points in that; are we concluding our debate, then? 




 The world finished, never to start again. 




 I'm just imagining the guy processing that refund. That's probably a guaranteed audit, right? 




 Chances are the kind of person who can game the lottery is keeping track anyway. 




 How much do you have to spend before being considered professional? Since $9 million isn't enough, clearly. 




 They usually deduct the taxes before giving you the money, so you would file for a $4 million refund? 




 You will this thread 




 If you spend $9 million on winning $10 million, do you pay taxes on $10 million or $1 million? 




 Also, it's not the banks that are suing. 




 Check out GiveDirectly. 




 You don't mess with 50% of mining power. 




 If I mine using the old (current) software, will nodes that upgraded accept that block? If yes, then this "softfork + hardfork" looks exactly the same as "nofork", so in what sense did the network fork at all? 




 They send it to the exchanges; since their chain is longer, the exchanges are on their chain.

Miners with 51% can enforce a minimum blocksize among many other things. 




 I don't think it's the same people who agreed that are suing, though. 




 Because he clearly didn't read past the title, or he'd know they aren't asking for a loan? 




 Somehow it feels like you didn't read the article  




 Again, if an exchange is doing that we have larger problems.

Let's start over: in your view, is there anything a company can do legally that wouldn't be right? 




  But if I offer you a deal and you think it's a fair deal, why am I the piece of shit?

But they *don't* think it's a fair deal. That's why many are refusing.

Three months is a long time to go unpaid, and it is unfair to ask anyone to work for nothing.

 And *didn't make a deal* with others, whose music will not be on Apple Music. 




  There's no problem with the trial thing.

Yes, I acknowledged the legality.

To be clear, is it your claim that you should never complain about something a company does as long as it's legal?  




 Your claim seems to be that anyone in business can do whatever they want. Sure, nobody's claiming that Apple acted illegally here (well, [maybe not](http://www.computerworld.com/article/2933342/technology-law-regulation/apple-and-music-labels-illegally-conspired-antitrust-probe-seeks-answers-itbwcw.html), but that's not this discussion). The claim is that Apple isn't acting properly, and artists are upset.

If an artist doesn't like their contract, they should go solo.

That's what Taylor did, and that's what a lot of artists who agree with her will do.

 No, someone who might pay for a song now won't for the next 3 months.

And again, if Apple thinks that won't happen, let *them* take the risk, not push it onto the artists. 




  The risk is that no record company will sign in with Apple.

No, the risk being discussed here is that people sign up for the trial, but don't continue afterwards, and artists lose sales they would have had otherwise. If Apple pays during the trial, then Apple's taking that risk, while now Apple's insisting that artists take that risk on themselves. 




 In the pouc, of course. 




 If Apple believes that, let them cover the loss for the first 3 months. Apple wants all the potential without any of the risk.

 Any miner is free to mine RBF, so unless you connect to all miners, you can't guarantee detection anyway. 




 https://www.mail-archive.com/bitcoin-development@lists.sourceforge.net/msg08439.html

Having said that... honestly, zeroconf is pretty broken already. Only
with pretty heroic measures like connecting to a significant fraction of
the Bitcoin network at once, as well as connecting to getblocktemplate
supporting miners to figure out what transactions are being mined, are
services having any hope of avoiding getting ripped off. For the average
user their wallets do a terrible job of showing whether or not an
unconfirmed transaction will go through. For example, Schildbach's
Bitcoin wallet for Android has no code at all to detect double-spends
until they get mined, and I've been able to trick it into showing
completely invalid transactions. In fact, currently Bitcoin XT will
relay invalid transactions that are doublepsends, and Schildbach's
wallet displays them as valid, unconfirmed, payments. **It's really no
surprise to me that nearly no-one in the Bitcoin ecosystem accepts
unconfirmed transactions without some kind of protection that doesn't
rely on first-seen-safe mempool behavior.** 




 Yes, and links to a model of how that works, in which this snitch location sending-back is fine. 




 I did.

There's nothing about that model that would mean this couldn't work, and you aren't explaining why you think it would. 




  in the model proposed in HPMOR, there are no multiple "loops." There is only a single self consistent reality. 

If that was the case, how could any timeline ever be consistent? Sending stuff back creates things that weren't there the first time around.

There aren't multiple loops in reality, but whatever creates reality must compute more than one loop.

It makes no difference if the variables he is solving for are the password to a safe or x,y,z,t coordinates. it's the same thing.

There isn't proof of impossibility inside HPMOR, and there's strong reasons to believe your model is incorrect, which you haven't addressed. 
























 What about Native Americans? 




 He did grant some refunds back in the day, as I understand. They were called "staking payments". 




 Can you imagine Josh sticking around for over a year still making payments though? 









  You can sue for anything but a law can only change through an act of legislator. It stays on the books even if it has no effect.

I guess I misunderstood how that works.

So laws that have been invalidated stay on the books?

Edit: just looked this up, yeah, that's right. Wouldn't it still be relevant, just like it would be relevant if you found that a bunch of states still outlawed all abortions, though? 




  based on what?

Because you aren't brute forcing. On the "first" loop, he sends back a location+time. On the "second" loop, he goes to that location at that time. Let's say he fails, because somehow his actions caused it to move; the next loop he's even closer, and eventually is right by it.

According to you, no time travel loops should ever be consistent, because you'll always create small perturbations. My point is that those are smoothed out. 




  Police are taught Garner. It is the standard.

Thanks, that's what I wanted to know.

It could stay on the books, but it wouldn't have any effect.

Could someone then sue to strike the law from the books?

And is this story analogous to finding that a state had an abortion ban on the books? 




 he is trying to determine the correct values for a set of variables (x,y,z position and time) with the intention to send back the correct solution only if it's found. It is exactly the same.

Again, he does not need to test every value until getting the right ones; the "loop" probably ends within two rounds if not less.

This is very different from Harry's brute force factoring algorithm.

 it happens to dumbledore in addition to harry, where attempts to use time turners to get more information result in them just writing notes to themselves not to bother.

Dumbledore wants the note and looks for it; he definitely didn't precommit to not write such a note.

Harry's a bit more complicated, but he did in fact write the note, it was in his handwriting. He definitely wasn't in a state of mind where he would never write such a note. There's even been theories that he played a prank on himself with that note (these are a bit complicated, though).

I see no reason why this couldn't be the same.

Specifically, because the info he was passing back isn't supposed to be difficult to get. There are far fewer loops required for it to become consistent, which makes any "complexity reducer" less likely to kick in. 




  You aren't understanding correctly. Garner v. Tennessee is law of the land and no law can be contrary to it.

That's what I thought. What am I missing? In particular, what are police taught in such a state?

Also, assuming these statutes were around when the Garner case was decided, why didn't that ruling automatically strike down those laws? 




  You are brute forcing a solution with multiple iterations, which is what got us "DO NOT MESS WITH TIME."

It's not brute force, just resolving perturbations. This happens elsewhere in HPMOR as well, and is well-established as possible. 




  It's mostly intellectual wanking

Welcome to /r/Futurology  




 It's technically possible for him not to catch it, but not in a way that maintains a consistent timeline.

If he tries to catch it at that time and it moves, for example, then he will need to send back a different message than the one he received, which makes that timeline inconsistent. 




 you used terminology that is causal.

It's sort of casual in the sense that it represents a deterministic universe model (neglecting QM). Some explanations will need to refer to the entire state of the universe, perhaps.

if it's not causal (which eliezer actually explicitly states in the link you posted), can you reformulate your assertion without causal language?

The (maybe)-possible worlds where Harry doesn't catch it are inconsistent, because in those worlds Harry sends back the info, but if he gets the info in the past, he does catch it. So there is no consistent world where he doesn't catch it, therefore he catches it.

I've also not seen an answer to the idea that he just sends back a message that cedric caught the snitch, or no message. these could be self-consistent realities.

He precommitted to send back a message with the location and time of the catching regardless of what happened, so those are not possible-worlds. 




 Yes, but some of these state laws are direct contradictions of the Garner ruling, if I'm understanding correctly. 









 That doesn't help me understand. What are police actually taught? 




 The trolley dilemma has a rational solution. The trolley dilemma is removed as soon as sentiment is removed from it.

You have yet to support this. I'd like to hear your resolution of the is-ought problem.

My claim is that selfishness isn't rational is from the perspective that selfishness may achieve your short term goals, but from a long term perspective it is a losing strategy.

In that case, you agree selfishness (as I use it) is rational, you just misunderstand what is meant by selfishness. Of course you also optimise long-term.

That said, even short-term selfishness can be rational; if someone only cares about the short-term, who are you to doubt their preferences?

We have not established a set of goals here... lets say the goal is to minimize your personal odds of harm.

That's definitely a selfish goals, let's take it for now.

 While having self-driving cars protect their owner seems like the choice that achieves that, the opposite is true. Assume the programming comes from the manufacturer and every car gets the same programming (because for something like this that will simply be true). Now, the odds of this situation coming up in your lifetime are incredibly small, but the odds of you being the driver in this situation are even smaller, but orders of magnitude. Therefore when taken on a lifetime basis the choice that causes the least loss of life is also the choice that is least likely to kill you personally.

However, as long as cars are user modifiable, each person still has an incentive to change their own car. It's a large PD.


There's also a larger problem with your philosophy; if you were in the car making the decision real-time (this may not be practical, but it's a thought experiment), would you choose suicide to save other people? If the answer is no, then why should you accept a car that makes that same choice for you?

Your answer is probably going to be that you benefit from everyone else doing so as well. But it's not rational to cooperate in every PD, and this scenario lacks the qualities that enable cooperation. 




  it implies causality between different universes.

No, it doesn't.

It's rather simple to lay out a consistent model here; that you can't see one is just evidence that you haven't thought enough about it.

See http://lesswrong.com/lw/fok/causal_universes/, and his comment [there](http://lesswrong.com/lw/fok/causal_universes/7wum) for some more links.

We'll see if you have any problems with the logical system defined there. 




 It's not evidence of *police* discrimination, or of discrimination now. 




  Is there a site on the internet where people actually discuss opposing points of view in an intelligent way?

There are many, you just need to look. It depends on what you want to discuss. Even many subs can have those kinds of discussions, mainly the smaller ones.

There's been a site started recently with that explicit goal you might want to check out: http://www.omnilibrium.com/ 




 Which drafter had a time machine? 




 Are police taught based on this case, or based on their local statute, which explicitly says otherwise?

For that matter, shouldn't local statutes that are contradicted by the Supreme Court be automatically struck down? 




  how so? he found the solution because he had the information.

Regardless of who wins, Harry will know when and where it was caught.

So are you suggesting it's possible he could send back the message "Cedric finds the snitch"?

No, the person who caught it isn't part of the message. In that case, he'd send back just the location and time, just like if he had caught it. However, that makes the cases where he doesn't catch it inconsistent, so it doesn't happen.

I don't need to be, because time turners are impossible, and the rules are not defined, even within the world.

The rules aren't rigorously defined, but there are enough bounds mentioned to extend the idea to certain other scenarios such as this one.

it's 100% conjecture about something that does not and cannot possibly exist.

You'll need to defend this idea; while I'd agree that in our world it's likely that time travel is impossible, the further claim that it cannot exist in any world seems hard to defend. I doubt you could even prove it's impossible given the laws of physics we know; as far as I know there is no consensus among physicists that wormholes cannot exist.

Do you deny that there are mathematically consistent models of time-travel, some of which make HPMOR consistent?

Once you're dismissing models because they aren't real, why read any fiction? Definitely fantasy, which isn't possible, but even other books are not true, and in the sense you seem to use the term, not possible. 




 That's really not that hard to mask. For one, what happens when you set up OB through Tor? It fails somehow, or blocks Tor IPs? 




 Are you trying to get fee free sales or many sales?

eBay charges a high fee, but they also provide a lot of exposure. What makes you think OB will do the same?

Plus, craigslist does have international sites. 




  I'm pretty sure the human brain isn't very good at understanding these "mechanics", if they can be called that at all.

You aren't inside my head, and that's quite presumptuous. If you claimed to understand yourself and thought my ideas contradicted the True Understanding, then you might have a point, but to claim it's not understandable at all because you don't understand is wrong.

HPMOR doesn't actually define the rules of time turners very explicitly, since they are impossible.

It's not defined explicitly; I've speculated at length in this sub on what those mechanics are given the things we do know. If you're interestested I can dig up the links.

As to why I think this specific case is implausible even within the loosely defined terms of the world, it is basically the same as the math search problem; actually, it's worse. The math problem had discrete solutions and a clear algorithm to solve it. If you treat the snitch as a set of variables (position, time, velocity), and let go of the intuition that this "seems normal" from a human perspective, you can see the "snitch finding algorithm" should run into the same problem as the math puzzle. It is attempting to brute force a search via temporal iterations.

There's a big difference; the math algorithm is designed as a brute force algorithm. The snitch isn't.

The equivalent in math would be "check if the numbers are the correct factors, if yes, send them back, if not, find the actual factors by asking whoever multiplied them or using a calculator, then send those numbers back". That only requires one "loop", and in my model it works.

In this case as well, he's not brute-forcing the search space, he's finding out the solution at the end of the loop through non-time-related methods, then sending that back, perfectly consistent with other time travel examples in HPMOR.

if you need to think about it intuitively, consider that the case where harry DOESN'T get the snitch first is more probable, so he doesn't bother sending back a message at all.

Harry resolves to send back the position of the Snitch regardless of who gets it. That makes your example inconsistent.

The time turner should optimize for path of least resistance

It's more complicated than that, and HPMOR doesn't actually say what we're optimising for, so there's some ambiguity there. 









 As promised:

1. We're talking about modifying your own car, not others. You have a point that it's similar to a PD, although it's not a perfect analogy, because there will be people who are never on the other side, who only drive. It's a lot more complicated than PD, more like many repeated half-PDs with different people.
2. I addressed this in the other reply.
3. Your claim is that selfishness is not rational, and your justification seems to be that it hurts other people. You then try to say it hurts yourself also, but then it wouldn't be true selfishness. Could you define rational in whatever sense you're using it that makes selfishness irrational?
4. Goals are not "objective", that's meaningless. Please explain what you mean. 




  that idiot will be busted in 24 hrs or less.

How so? Has OB had some technical breakthrough that allows for forced deanonymization on a decentralized platform? If not, how can you prevent people from selling whatever they want?   




 If the company was called TS1 at the time instead of Pixar, yes. 




 That actually doesn't address my point at all. You can sell on craigslist and accept bitcoin with no fees, so openbazaar isn't helping you as far as I can see if you were going to sell on ebay. 




 I've thought about time travel a lot, including specifically in HPMOR.

Why wouldn't this work given the HPMOR mechanics? 




 Funding a company that makes a single product can reasonably be called funding that product. 




 I'll try to address your other points later, but as for 2, how do you get around the is-ought problem and assert specific ethical injunctions? 




 1. It seems pretty clear that using a car that was exactly like the standard autonomous car but optimises for the owners' health in such situations is better for that owner. How is that irrational?
2. Do you feel either side of the trolley dilemma is irrational, and if so, why?
3. Your last point seems to imply that selfishness is what causes the problem; however, selfishness is a preference, and can't be irrational by itself unless you're using a nonstandard definition.
4. What part of the arguments here do you consider unobjective? 




 Have you been reading the prequels? 




 For one; when WMDs are sold anonymously online, will we be better off? 




 If AI don't specifically like us, they won't need these technologies to destroy us.

That doesn't make the other points invalid though. 




 There were six listed in the government's sentencing submission. That's just the ones they could prove likely came from SR (one was discovered dead with their browser open to SR, and a tracking number within belonging to a drug package nearby). 




 The claims in there of safety are speculation, not data based. Read it yourself please. 




 The government introduced evidence of six deaths. 




 When you have VCs funding these noncompanies, it can get confusing. 




 That's not a fair analogy; the benefit from internet communication is orders of magnitudes greater than the potential loss from terrorist use. It's nonobvious to say the least that the same is true of decentralized marketplaces. We all know that illicit sales will be a significant portion of what takes place, far more than the portion of internet communication that is illicit. 




 So 

Is anything written there untrue?

i do think that any AI worthy of being a threat won't need Openbazaar to be dangerous, but the other points seem valid if true. 




 Leonard! Stephen Hawking said something that I didn't understand! 




 If you read the actual articles, they say it affects anyone without solar panels, such as the poor and people in apartments. They also mention that those are disproportionately minorities, but it's not the main point.  




 The argument seems to be that the money given for solar panels is more than what the utility makes from the energy, and so they must raise prices for those without panels, who end up paying more than they should.

 Point out to your friends that even though individual votes may not matter, posting on social media may convince many people not to vote, which will matter more.

So they should stfu online. 




  I also don't think the question is valid.

From your next part it sounds like you think the answer is simple. But that doesn't imply the question is invalid.

Always minimize loss of life.  If you have to choose one life over another choose the one with least property damage. If both are equal in all respects (probably will never happen) choose the driver.

That implies killing the least number of people if possible, which is one possible answer. However, note that the driver might not like this, and might not want such a car.

There are ethical problems with designing features that only hurt the owner.

It's definitely not as simple as you make it out to be, there's also the many people who don't think we should kill one person in the trolley problem and so on. 




 It assumes a level of knowledge that isn't practically possible. If I was designing a system I would design it to minimize harm as well as it could, with no life having priority over any other

How is that possible? If it comes to such a situation as described, what does it actually do?

Or are you claiming that design decisions will never need to take into account these kinds of situations? Isn't it better to decide them now rather than depend on some system that you feel shouldn't be answering these questions anyway?

That is, unless you think a autonomous car will somehow never have enough data to decide that it's in a situation with tradeoffs, anyone designing a car needs to decide which tradeoff to take.

It's also been posted at least three times already this week.

That is wrong.

http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/indemnify

To compensate for loss or damage; to provide security for financial reimbursement to an individual in case of a specified loss incurred by the person. 




 That's not what indemnify means, or at least not the only meaning. 




  Indemnity is already true from a legal standpoint for search engine/aggregators (Google News for example)

Source? Where was someone found liable to Google to pay legal expenses?

This guy seems to be under the mistaken impression that Apple is granting themselves further protections under the law than what already exists.

It's pretty clear that the terms aren't legally enforceable because he didn't agree to them; Apple pretty much implies that they are taking them as agreed to.

I mean, how do you read

When your RSS content is included in News, here are the terms that will apply:

, knowing that they are including your content by default, and not interpret that as Apple claiming something they shouldn't be? Terms are generally understood as creating new legal obligations. 




 The question is whether to prioritize your own life over others. 




  Do you think we will have a worldwide nuclear war in the next 20 years?

Unwilling to say. There are strong reasons to think either way, and I don't feel qualified to speculate.

This does bring up the discussion of international political economy response to a country developing stuff other countries dont like  which meets your second question. Typically this is met with sanctions then war.

That only works if the other countries are more powerful. If one country develops robots first, I doubt the world is competent enough to ban them worldwide. 




 That's a false dictotomy; you can have too little control to stop but enough to choose between options. 




  To make the jump from where we are to the robot replacement ignores hundreds of thousands of steps that provide feedback and allow for course correction or organized activism to affect the outcome that, if the system of political economy is working, (whether or not it is working to my or your satisfaction currently is not relevant) should stop it from happening.

How can you stop that? Would you support a ban on robots?

Give details, please.

To take your third point specifically, when enough people are affected they will do something about it. Conflict is as much a part of economics as money or anything else. It is a way people respond to the distribution of scarce resources.

That has historically failed far too many times for me to feel safe.

The problem with the current state of income inequality is that, save the very poorest people, most people have a standard of living that was unimaginable even 30 years ago. 

Define "most people". If you mean 50% of humans on this planet, that is *not* obvious, and needs to be argued for.

People (I am talking about in the US here) are not changing things because for the vast majority of them, life aint really that bad.

Agreed, although I think the majority is less than vast.

Switch over to your example  and lets just say we are half way to your extreme example where people are being replace at a relatively high rate and unable to find gainful employment  the picture changes at that point and the people organize to get their interests and needs heard and met.

And how do these 50% of humans, say, who can't do anything better than robots, "organize to get their needs met"? Who has an incentive to meet their needs?

I like [this quote](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/)

Once a robot can do everything an IQ 80 human can do, only better and cheaper, there will be no reason to employ IQ 80 humans. Once a robot can do everything an IQ 120 human can do, only better and cheaper, there will be no reason to employ IQ 120 humans. Once a robot can do everything an IQ 180 human can do, only better and cheaper, there will be no reason to employ humans at all, in the vanishingly unlikely scenario that there are any left by that point.

How exactly will people mobilize to prevent that? 




  The company that is building and programing robots in the near term I would imagine. Or are you talking robots buildin robots?

Well, yes. If a robot can do anything you can, there's no reason the company still hires you as opposed to a robot.

Theoretically, the leisure class will have arrived (if the human race was rational) and people would be involved in the production and programming

But we've stipulated that robots are better than humans; why have a human produce and program when a robot can do it more efficiently?

or just share in the resources our new robot overlords provided and chillax.

HAHAHAHAHAHAHA. Excuse me, have you seen what happens to actual modern day societies when there are extra resources? They don't end up trickling down too much. If we can't solve poverty for people nowdays, what makes you think we'll succeed when humans are superfluous?

 In reality  because most people dont like to share - most likely wars and unrest on an unimaginable scale until a new normal is established due to the economic disparity between the haves and have-nots.

It looks you like you do get it; so why your argument above that this is natural (and implicitly safe)? 




 The fact that the people lobbying are in the zinc industry doesn't mean the only argument for keeping the penny is that it saves jobs.

Even if there were strong arguments unrelated to saving jobs, you'd still expect the ones to care about it most would be the ones who make money from it. 




 When I can buy a robot that can do literally everything you can do but for less, who is going to hire you?

Previous "industrial progress" didn't completely replace humans because they couldn't do some things humans could.

General AI would be able to. 














 There seems to be some sort of entitlement that users in here can dictate exactly what services provide them.

The other extreme is not allowing any user complaints. Your logic would say that no one can ever complain about anything a company did, with the possible exception of actually illegal actions.

 I think some people need a refresher, that if an organization is providing a service, and you do not follow the rules, there is a good chance they will not serve you.

Which rules? Their terms do not mention any restrictions on email.

If you would prefer to work by your own rules, you are free to create your own platform.

Would you say the same to someone complaining about Paypal's policies? Obviously nobody is forcing me to use circle, but why is complaining illegitimate?

Would you say the same to someone complaining about Coinbase closing accounts that donated to Gwern?

I would imagine there is a reason behind this, perhaps overlapping from the promotions when they were handing out free Bitcoin for accounts.

I've been ID verified and got no bonus, so that doesn't apply.

If you don't want to, I don't really see a reasonable explanation why Circles policies should adjust for your individual case...

If they want to disallow some emails, they should at least tell me on signup, or make the policy change public. 




 Some of us have seen way too many poorly done studies to trust like that.

When over half of studies fail to replicate, that's not an unreasonable attitude to have towards a single study. When there are multiple studies, meta-studies, etc, then we can put a bit more trust. 




 It's never *easy* to shift someone's beliefs, especially parents. 




 He explicitly says he's fine with that part; it's indemnifying Apple he's got a problem with.

 Circle verifies ID, there's no reason they should have a problem with the email. 




 Thanks.

So cards without cashout to cash I can ignore?

 




 And that takes how long? And to do this for each site you want to sign up for?

There are legitimate reasons I use opayq, and switching to gmail would take so much longer. 




 So, 24 times as long as opayq.

Plus you need to check it, whereas opayq forwards all emails to your main. 




 I don't plan to travel at all, I'm only interested in churning for cash.

Does that mean I can completely disregard all miles/hotels/airlines cards, or are those sometimes useful even for non-travelers? 




 blur is easier.

How long does it take to open a gmail account? Compared to 5 seconds for a new opayq email. 
























 Wouldn't the same logic say to not give income tax breaks to religious people, because they might spend it on religious things? 




 Just because you don't want the money doesn't mean other schools don't, or that it shouldn't be offered. Presumably you could just refuse it even if it was offered.

I'm sure a lot of private schools *do* want the money.

And seriously, "Taking state money makes you accountable to the state and all of its standards and curriculum and bureaucracy etc"? As far as I know, schools need to be accredited anyway, regardless of if they take funds. (Although that might be different for different states, not sure about that.) 




  This is less to help poor kids go to a private school and more about destroying public schools and giving well off people a discount on their private school fees.

Why doesn't this help poor people, though? Nobody's saying you should need to be rich to get the vouchers, are they? 




 So what about funding only the non-religious aspects of private schools? What's the problem with that? 




 If they're providing a service the government already provides, and people using them saves the government money, it doesn't seem unreasonable for them to get government funding.

I mean, for my state I've seen numbers that the government would save a whole lot of money just offering vouchers for less than public school costs the government. 




 When someone's in the vault legitimately, there's a goblin right next to them, though. The lock is presumably for those who get in unofficially.  




 That could just mean that he could legally prevent him from getting into his vault. But once he's in there legally, he can take whatever he wants. Don't let people into your vault if you don't want them taking stuff.

  You need exactly one random number per spin (or you can use a single random number to seed a PRNG if you need a few more, but you don't ever really need very many for this sort of game). So, what you do is have a counter that you are incrementing very quickly (on a modern processor, billions of times a second) and then simply use whatever's in the counter when the user spins. It is impossible for the user to predict or control the counter since it's going so much faster than human reaction time.

If you do that, your effective entropy is however many times you can increment in a human's reaction time\*. [This source](https://www.ethicalhacker.net/features/book-reviews/mitnick-the-art-of-intrusion-ch-1-hacking-the-casinos-for-a-million-bucks) puts the time for a skilled person at five milliseconds. Assuming 1 billion possibilities per second, and a human capable of hitting a target within five milliseconds, the number of possibilities is 5 million, or around 22 bits of entropy. There are 311,875,200 possibilities for 5 cards out of 52 in order, so knowing that is certainly enough to determine what the seed is. Even with a slightly lower reaction time, you could still do it. Slot machines may have less bits leakage, though.

\*reaction time isn't really the right word here, you're aiming the first few times just to know what time you pressed it, and the time when you actually press something you may want to press it at a specific time. 




 From the top comment at [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9797918):

I don't think he did much wrong here. It doesn't appear that he actually broke in to your computers, he just submitted lots of bets.
**If you're going to run a casino (whose entire business model is based on exploiting weaknesses of others for profit), don't be surprised if people try to exploit your weaknesses for profit.**

Can't say I disagree. 




 The statement I took issue with was

 Not sure if it uses entropy at all.

in the context of someone using the lack of entropy to beat the program. My statement right before that was:

If you are generating it locally, there might be a limit on how much entropy is available, which would mean you could get a lot of data and then analyse it to get the algorithm.

So the way I used entropy there was including anything that could be analysed, which includes pre-programmed "entropy".

Given that I introduced the word into the discussion, did in fact use the standard definition, and the reply used the same word but using a different definition (according to you), I don't see what's wrong with my pointing out above that their statement makes no sense with the words it used. If they want to clarify, they can do so. 




  When people speak of introducing "entropy" into a program they pretty much never mean accessing pseudo-randomness that was present in the system in it's initial state. They mean getting hardware-based entropy in real-time.

Well they should specify if they are using a non-standard definition. Preselected entropy has its own problems (in particular it may be leaked), but that doesn't mean it doesn't count as entropy. 




 (I'm assuming every number is a bit, for simplicity.)

It will still take you N/M completely unpredictable interactions to start getting information you can make sense of.

That is equivalent to saying that your system uses at least N bits of entropy (perhaps minus a small constant). If your system uses less, say Y, then after observing YN bits, I can already start predicting. It might take a handful of more bits just to confirm, but your statement can't be true unless you come pretty close to N bits of entropy. 




  When he says "unpredictable one from the next" he is probably referring to unpredictability for the end user given the information exposed to them, not completely unpredictable knowing everything there is to know about the system state. You don't need any entropy for the former whereas you certainly need entropy for the latter.

The information exposed to them is exactly however many bits they're willing to pay for. If we assume each play gives you 4 or so bits, then 100 plays gives you 400 and won't cost too much, and if you don't have at least 400 bits of entropy to work with, those 400 bits will probably yield useful info.

If you have *no* entropy, then anyone playing a couple games can already analyse it. See my sibling comment for a bunch of examples of this. 




  Not aware of any incidents in the company's history of anyone being able to predict the outcome of a game in the wild.

 It's not doing any sort of cryptography, it just needs results which are unpredictable one from the next.

Uh, that requires entropy. In fact, if it's completely unpredictable, it's got to have as much entropy as the number of bits used.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory):

**Entropy is a measure of unpredictability of information content.** 




  Well, it uses a random number generator, and when you press 'spin' it has a x% chance of picking the low reelband and a y% chance of picking the high reelband, where x and y are chosen so that overall the payout is, say, 83% (or whatever).

I pretty much figured that from what you said previously.

There's no way to predict what the random number generator will decide. Some jurisdictions require an externally-approved generator, some even require the random numbers to come from an external server. But there is no way to predict what a slot machine is going to give you without nefarious and probably illegal means.

I've seen too many stories about profits from reverse-engineering RNGs to assume that there isn't a way. If you are generating it locally, there might be a limit on how much entropy is available, which would mean you could get a lot of data and then analyse it to get the algorithm. 




 No - it's decided after you pay, for each spin (rather than across all spins for one session).

What information goes into this decision? It's generating some random bits *somehow* to decide which reel to use; is there any way to predict that? 




 Is there any way to tell which one was chosen before betting (or choosing how much to bet)?

  I have a high IQ. It's a fact. But it is just a number. I did not say that I am a highly accomplished individual. Insisting on evidence of intelligence though accomplishment is like telling someone who is 7'2" that he is not tall because he doesn't play for the NBA.

Which test did you get that number from? Is it a well-validated test? Or just some random test online that spits out meaningless numbers?

The SAT measures achievement, so you can get a very high score by studying. An IQ test measures aptitude.

 Most people that think they're really smart are not. I'd expect some evidence (Ivy League degree, founded large company, invented something complicated, etc) first. Considering you admit you aren't making that much compared to your less gifted husband, maybe you should reconsider why you think you're so smart.

For the record, .5 top IQ isn't even that smart. I got a 1600 Math/Reading SAT, which corresponds to around 1/1000, or top .1%.

Anyway, chess is mostly practice, at least at higher levels. Chess masters don't do better on non-chess related problems, it's just that spending 30,000 hours on anything while not being a complete idiot (say bottom 25-50% IQ or so) makes you pretty good.

 How was slavery being made illegal in the South before the secession? 




 If the North weren't trying to free the Southern slaves, why would the South secede to stop that from happening?  




 Saving the Union meant getting the South to stop the sucession; had they done so, there would be no need for war.

The South seceded because they *thought* Lincoln was going to free the slaves, among other reasons. That doesn't make it the main issue in the war if the North was fighting for a different reason.

I guess my main problem is with people who think the North was fighting in order to free the slaves, or that slavery was the sole reason for the South. 




 Never ever buy anything on a credit card if you aren't sure you'll be able to pay it by the next statement. If you need to borrow money, don't do it with credit cards. There are better ways.

Pay every bill as soon as you get it, and set up autopay for as many as possible. 




 They left because (among other things) they *thought* Lincoln would free the slaves. Whether that was correct (i.e. would Lincoln have done anything like that had they not seceded) is debatable. If the Emancipation Proclamation had been before the succession, you would be right. 




 That wasn't what I meant, sorry. I see how it could be misunderstood.

My point is that since only one side was fighting for slaves (or thought they were), the war was not "mainly" about slaves. Nothing about who was right. 




 How is that not an offer, though? He basically said "if the only way to get you to stop is by letting you have slaves, then I will". If the Southern states' main reason was ensuring they could have slaves, they should have taken him up on that.

And my second point remains. The North fought to prevent the South from seceding, *not* to free the slaves. 




 Your claim seems to imply that the reason the North fought was to free the slaves. Got any sources for that? 




 There are two sides to the war; the Northern side's reason for going to war was not to free the slaves. 




 Then why did the states fight even after they were offered to keep those rights? Or for that matter, why did Lincoln offer that if the main purpose of the war was to free the slaves? 




 They seceded well before any of those rights were taken away, though. 




 I didn't say it wasn't a large part. Read my comment more carefully. And I don't fly any flags, that's just irrelevant. 




 Well if you know some history you'd be one of those people too. 

Edit: my claim is that it wasn't completely, or (arguably) mostly, about slavery. IIRC Lincoln was ready to let the south keep their slaves at one point if it would stop the war. 

It was definitely part of it, though, just not a large a part as many might think. 




 \* insert stupid comment here\* 




 Think of one of your hobbies, one you put a lot of time into; say, at least 5-10 hours a week you spend reading the latest news about it, thinking about it, commenting online about it, etc.

Now, you've been doing that for years. I know absolutely nothing about it. How long would it take me to learn enough that I know more than you?  




  but it would be pretty messed up for a company to provide a service and completely misrepresent the costs.

Welcome to the business world. 




 Could it be that you were paying that to the company, and also paying 2% or so to the issuers? And maybe someone along the way misunderstood and thought the small fee was all there was? Because I really don't think any small business can pay that little based on what I know. 




 Those are Interchange Plus Pricing, which is on top of the credit card fees to the issuer. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interchange_Plus

There is no way you're paying less than a percent total.

For comparison, paypal and square take 2.7%, amazon local register takes 2.5%. These are viewed as competitive rates. 




  In the old system you were still subsidizing old/sick people.

Please source this. Why would any insurance do that, which seems to be strictly suboptimal for them, if they weren't being forced?

Why would the law need to force the insurance companies to do that if they were doing it anyway? 




 Yes, I pay less, but not enough less. I'm paying more because of this law to subsidize old/sick people, when I shouldn't be, and you're trying to pass it off as "standard insurance practice", when it isn't. 




  and the whole thing hinges on the premise that young people...can and should subsidize the healthcare of baby boomers

From http://abcnews.go.com/Business/top-reasons-young-adults-sign-affordable-care-act/story?id=22690267:

Prior to the ACA, older and/or unhealthy adults could be charged more than five times what young, healthy adults were for health insurance premiums. The ACA limits this "age-rating" ratio to threethat is, older or unhealthy individuals can be charged only up to three times what the young and healthy pay.

So if I'm a fifth as risky as a high-risk person, I still need to pay a third of what they pay, which means I'm overpaying. The ACA outlawed charging based on risk for more than a 1:3 ratio. Yes, that was invented by the ACA. 




 Except generally the people at higher risk pay more. You should pay the same amount as anyone else with the same expected cost, and those should balance out for the insurance company; but if I'm low risk, why should I pay more because insurance companies aren't allowed to charge more to high-risk people? They can only charge the highest risk people at most 3 times of the lowest risk people, regardless of how large the difference in risk may be. 




 Sigh ...

I went through it again and copied the text.

In this particular city, you have two options: you can take the local train, which is cheap, or you can take the express train, which is more expensive but which will save you a full hour of travel time. (Suppose your plans aren't time-sensitive, **and that you don't have anything fun to do on the train  you'll just be waiting in your seat throughout the ride, and there isn't really anything to see outside the window.**) 




  Also unless I skim-read over the top of it, the train scenario didn't give any concrete numbers for exactly how much time it saves, so drawing any conclusion about the consistency of our valuation of time seems suspect.

Pretty sure it specified *exactly* 1 hour. 




  I would be willing to spend more money on using the do-it-fast machine than on the express train because I can do other things on the slower train (e.g. play video games) whereas if I have a task that must be done on the weekend it is something that would require my attention and prevent multitasking.

It specified that you can't do anything fun on the train. Careful reading -2! 




 I got rationalist and 86.84%, not too bad.

I do wish it broke down what the "correct" answer should be where I lost points ... 




 And did he pass them on? Yes. 




 She was against gay marriage, for the Iraq war, for the Patriot act. 




 If she'd done that, she'd still be a billionaire. 




 Well, if it succeeds, would the devs switch? 




 Isn't your argument completely symmetrical? Gavin won't be a dev anymore on the main code if he goes ahead with the fork. 




 Did *not* expect this one to be a bot too. 




  The reality is of course it is ultimately there will be a vote by miners. The most work chain will always win and the miners will prove they are more powerful than the subreddit, the developers, full node operators, merchants and the exchanges combined. None of the other groups will ever be able to challenge the most work chain, in my view.

It's more complicated than that; even if 95% of miners change, since this is a hard-fork, no exchanges or nodes can be forced onto the new chain. If 95% of miners *don't* change, they can stop the fork assuming it's backwards-compatible with old blocks, but not in reverse. 




 I agree with you; I just wanted to point out that parent's claim of "90% support one side" can be twisted both ways. 




 The question is whether you're talking about the 90% of devs who didn't like Gavin's proposal, or the 90% of bitcoin users who did.

 Great way to get shut down. 




 That was not obvious at all. 




 When did the Pharisees say there was no resurrection? It sounds like you're talking about resurrection in general; but that's well documented in the Old Testament. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resurrection#Judaism_and_Samaritanism 

Also, it's only a theory, and my source says right after that Ibn Ezra rejects it. 




  Probably

 There's one theory that he actually killed him, and he was resurrected.

http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0001_0_00627.html

Ibn Ezra (commentary on Gen. 22:19) also quotes an opinion that Abraham actually did kill Isaac (hence there is no reference to Isaac returning home with his father), and he was later resurrected from the dead.  




 Stop shouting or I'll no longer be willing to have conversations with you. 




 You mention not being allowed to make loans; I'm interested in shorting fully collateralized (against fiat), which wouldn't require any loans. Is there a chance of that? 




 Are there plans to offer shorting?

 I'm not so interested in those, because there's a $250 limit, they charge shipping, and don't accept Amex.
