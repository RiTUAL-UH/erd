 That is the first time I've heard of that sensation! It does sound more enjoyable than the spins, though. 




 Who is your favorite marvel villian? Why is he or she your favorite? 




 My first time getting high was amazing because I was in a secure, fun environment that contained good friends and plenty of visual and audial stimuli. 




 Have you ever experienced an 11? I appreciated the picture!
 
























 This community is one of my favorite subreddit groups [9] 




 This place is in Bozeman, but I do love Missoula! 




 I wish! I'm actually on a bridge. I'll upload a pic of the bridge when I'm done with class.
Edit: [this is the bridge](http://imgur.com/BDH0Ya7)
 




 I thank you! 
























 I would not recommend smoking in the dorms; the way the smell travels in a dorm and the risk of getting caught or tattled on by an RA, shitty roommate, or custodian could not only get you in trouble but also make you super paranoid. This warning being said, though, making stoner buddies is an awesome, easy process that helps with developing a new core of friends, and this process is much easier to do in a dorm because such a living area offers floor activities such as pillow fights, folf games, etc. and encourages residents to be comfortable with the people around them. Also, smoking off campus encourages you to go find cool outdoor spots, which beat out indoor spots any day of the week in my mind. The most important thing to remember, though, is that academics should take precedence when you're at college; you don't necessarily need to cut down on your habits, but be sure to tackle your school work before you toke. You're now having to pay for your education; make the most of it!  




 Nice! How would i do that? 




 To me, magnanimous has a kind of rugged beauty like that of a handsome mountain man or grizzled soldier. 




 Man, I am super envious that you have the option to smoke at a coast area. I went to Oregon when I was younger and thought the state's coast's gray color and slight chill were charming and unique. 
























 Thanks! I will probably shave in a few days. I don't really enjoy the feel of facial hair. I respect people who can grow a good mustache or beard, though.

 I'll take a hit for you tonight, OP!

 Jesus, I understand if people weren't interested, but how can anyone - man, woman, child, lizard person, whoever - think that that kind of rudeness is acceptable? 




 I appreciate your politeness and helpfulness! 




 I apologize if this post didn't follow or didn't belong in this subreddit. I am not entirely sure where to put this. 




 Oh, wow, thank for telling me that! 
























 Aww, thanks! 




 Thank you! 




 Damn, number 19 should be out breaking hearts, not fighting wars. 




 I appreciate your enthusiasm and support, but I think you should be careful about making broad, sweeping statements about either gender. Both genders have experienced hardship and unfairness. And while the individuals in our situations were acting rudely, they do not portray the definitive character of their gender; they were simply being jerks. 
























 I read your title in Captain Price's voice. 




 The cat and the fat sack? 




 I enjoy twin stick shooters such as Super Stardust HD. 




 I'm high and feel as if I'm seeing 3D for the first time in my life. 
























 That technique works wonders in r/news and r/worldnews as well.  




 To be fair, I've known plenty of guys who have made a tinder account for the same reason. But I do agree that their are some super shitty people on those apps. Congrats on finding your SO by the way! 




 I think that viewing this situation in an empathetic manner is key. We should be empathetic for op who is a person who happens to be a guy; it's unfortunate that he was labeled as a rapist/sexual predator/etc. simply because he was walking in the same direction as a person who is a woman was walking. We should also be empathetic for the person who is a woman, however, because her feeling threatened by such a little thing is also unfortunate. While I am in no way condoning her being rude afterwards - wrongly accusing someone as being something as heinous as a sexual predator is not something that should just be brushed off and ignored because such a title carries significant social and legal repercussions for the person receiving the title - the fact that we live in a world where such caution needs to be taken shows that a problem of how we as a society handle sexual assault - both in terms of the treatment of the victims of the crime and the people who are wrongfully accused of committing or planning to commit such inhuman acts - does exist. In my perfect world, people who are women would not have to always feel fearful of being the victims of rape/sexual assualt/etc and people who are men would not have to live in fear of having their benign actions being viewed as lecherous motives.  




 Damn, I didn't know that you could smoke WITH bubblers! Are they good at cornering?
