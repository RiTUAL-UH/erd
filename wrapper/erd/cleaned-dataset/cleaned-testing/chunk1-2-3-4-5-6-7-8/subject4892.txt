 I can't imagine a worse possible team for a WR with "great raw skills, but a lot of learning and developing left to do." 




 I remember reading somewhere that square planned out IX, X and XI all at the same time. The idea was that IX was kindof a final tribute to the old days, X was like the "This is the direction Final fantasy is now heading in" and XI was their stab at the newly developing MMO market. Their goal was essentially to cover all the bases.

 I really doubt Cam Newton and (to a lesser extent) Andy Dalton are going to make huge jumps this year, just because they both played so well as rookies last year. But how about the other three quarterbacks drafted in the top-12?

Christian Ponder and Blaine Gabbert had miserably bad QB ratings, but they also were throwing to some of the worst receiving corps in the league, and behind some of the worst offensive lines. Jake Locker, obviously barely played at all. Do you think any of these guys will end up in the "pretty good" group of quarterbacks this year? 




 Yes yes yes yes yes to all of this, also:

 In another sub? Sure. But not in truereddit. That's kinda the reason this place exists. 




 24 upvotes? Glad to know this subreddit has gone completely to shit. 




 Looking for Legal Advice?
This subreddit is for discussing developments in the law and jurisprudence. While posts may OCCASIONALLY seek advice about law school or careers, this is not a forum for soliciting or giving legal advice. 




 To be fair, despite what most armchair critics will say, the tax code NEEDS to be as complex as it is (for the most part), because taxation is a complex subject. The florida criminal code? Not quite so much.

  How is a dog sniff not a search? Because there's no reasonable expectation of privacy under that circumstance? Just because society/the Supremes have determined that the fruit of that police action is admissible - regardless of the reason - its still a search.

I saw you say that you're a criminal defense attorney, and I'm just a 2L fresh out of crim pro, so I certainly give deference to your opinion, but...

When we're talking about 4th amendment jurisprudence, the question of what a "search" is for this specific body of law involves an intrusion by a state actor upon a reasonable expectation of privacy. For the aforementioned reasons, there is no reasonable expectation of privacy that is being intruded, thus it is not a search.

Something closer to your hearsay example would be something like a *hot pursuit* exception. In that case it IS a search, but it's still "reasonable" and thus constitutional, but it is a search regardless.  




 It really isn't. When you wiretap you are listening in on a phone call, if it's done in a telephone booth or a home, then the courts have long recognized that there is a privacy interest that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable. Because it intrudes upon that interest, it is now a search.

It's not a matter of what they use to intrude, it's a matter of what they're intruding upon. A dog sniff intrudes upon NOTHING except the fact that there are or aren't drugs in a suitcase. Nothing else about the inside of that suitcase is revealed. Protecting drug possession is not a legitimate interest. Therefore, it is not a search. A wiretap intrudes upon every conversation made over the tapped phone. The intrusion is much much greater because they're intruding upon all conversations made from private places. The courts have never had issue with whether or not there was a reasonable expectation of privacy in making phone calls. 

You should actually read *Katz* and *Place* and the the distinction will seem much more clear. 




 No, that is wrong. Look at [Katz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katz_v._United_States) and its progeny, there are factors that go into whether there is a reasonable expectation of privacy. Your second sentence doesn't even make sense because we're not questioning whether the search is "legal," we're questioning whether or not there is a search at all. 

A person needs a legitimate interest to have a reasonable expectation of privacy. In less eloquent terms: not having all of your belongings rummaged through by policemen is a legitimate privacy interest. 

The only piece of your privacy a dog sniff invades is to the fact that you are carrying drugs or not. The privacy of everything else about that bag is not intruded upon in any way. Because there is no legitimate  interest in drugs, and because the "sniff" does not intrude into the privacy of your briefcase in any other way, then it is not a search.

 ITT: redditors don't understand taxes 




 The court has absolutely not done this. See [Ciraolo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_v._Ciraolo) where they confirmed flyovers where constitutional under the "plain view" doctrine on the theory that passengers flying overhead in a plane could see your backyard. There are a multiplicity of other examples where technology is permissible.  




 Tried posting in there. Got downvoted anyways :/ 




 I understand the trail you're going down, but I don't think it's the proper analysis to be asking. The standard enunciated in *Katz* is whether or not the privacy expectation is one that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable. 

Plain view has long held the standard of "no privacy expectation" because that a ridiculous limit on police powers (think; license plates, hair color etc.). This court hits a weird string with technology because now the police are gathering MOUNTAINS of data that, in pieces, would fall under the plain view exception. The policy the majority is pushing (That was originally stated, as dicta, in Kyllo) that the reasonable expectation is going to shrink as technology expands. But this feels like a stretch of the ruling Kyllo, because the logic isn't quite on point.

I really like this policy, but I don't like it as applied to GPS tracking devices, because this isn't question a question of a deeper intrusion into someone's privacy, but rather a much broader intrusion. And ultimately I don't think this summation of publicly discoverable information should rise to the reasonable expectation standard when taken as a whole.

Again, it's a minority opinion, and I definitely understand why most people disagree with me, but I don't think it's open and shut in either direction by any means. 




 No, the 4th amendment is a limit on the powers of government action, this has nothing to do with private citizens. 




 This is a constitutional limit placed on government powers... it's not like any agencies are just *exempt* from this. 




 I'll be in the deep minority here and kinda disagree with this one. 

Sotomayor notes that there is a privacy interest in the sum of ones public movements; which wouldn't be so if there was simply a tail on him for 28 days, and the Kyllo argument feels unconvincing because they're not gaining any insight (his location) through technology that isn't public at any given time (i.e. the infrared heat patterns of a home). It seems like a matter of police efficiency rather than a deeper invasion, and I just don't love the jurisprudence.

That said, having the court actually rule in favor of expanding the 4th amendment is a breath of fresh air, and I do like the policy they're keeping in mind with regards to technology and expanding police power in investigation, so I won't complain. 




 Okay.

 I'm a Christian and I'm studying tax law, so I may know a thing or two about tax exempt entities. These pastors are not acting in affiliation with their churches, but as private individuals with their own right to free speech. There are no legitimate grounds for revoking their exempt status. 




 There honestly is nothing even remotely true about that sentence.

 Maybe too late to be noticed but: debt incurred does not count against income, only interest accrued against you on the debt does. So worst case scenario if you're at 100k debt at 8% and none of it is subsidized you're looking at  -8k. 




 Wat. Dwight for the 10-11 season had *at least* a moderately more extensive set of offensive weapons to use. Did you not notice how his ppg went from 18.3 to 22.9 last year?

 What is that I don't even 




 Chicken sandwich, no pickles, +tomato, then manually apply one pack of chick fila sauce. Ask for an arnold palmer to drink. I worked there for 3 years and that was my favorite item.

Runner up meal: buy the tenders, ask for bbq and ranch, dip the tenders in both packets one at a time. Glorious.

One that was only open to employees: the maraschino cherries came in giant buckets and were in a cherry juice that was substantively grenadine. Chick fila goes heavy on the syrup for their soft drinks, so the soda fountain sprite + cherry juice made the best shirley temples I've ever had. 

Another thing I did (that isn't available to the public), was take the caramel packets that come with the catering fruit trays, and mix in a medium fruit cup thoroughly so it was like a candy soup. 

Okay, that was actually kindof gross. But it was awesome. 




  "When I was going to law school, and I sold my (Chevrolet) Corvair to make first-semester tuition and books for $330, a sizeable portion of the faculty had tenure."

 Meh, I feel like the only way we keep peace with r/atheism is to not give them anything to be mad about. In recent history this sub has turned a lot more to "poking fun," and I don't think it's inherently bad, but I'd rather keep the tension as low as possible.

 We've just about been "terrifyingly close [...] to complete totalitarian fascism" since the end of the reconstruction era.

The police force has been empirically much more professionalized ever since the Burger court's jurisprudence for criminal procedure and the Miranda warning waiver regime.

I'm really sorry about your friend, it's incredibly shitty what happened, but CowboyDan is right to point out that it's really not anything new in the broader sense of government power.

 Reddit, I'm reposting this from the John Paulson loophole thread because I missed the boat aready

I'm not going to comment on whether or not this type of loophole should be closed, but I think understanding the system a little better could be help put into perspective why he's only paying 15% in taxes:

There are generally two main ways for the government to tax. 1. As personal income- we all understand that there are marginal rates etc. 2. Through a corporate double taxation- this means that the corporation will be taxed on its net income. But remember, corporations are merely a collection of people, the stockholders. So AFTER the corporation is taxed once, the government puts a 15% tax on the distribution of that money to it's owners.

for instance, hypothetically if the corporate rate is 35% and the capitol gains rate is 15%, that means for every dollar a corporation earns only 1(1 - .35)(1 - .15), or 55 cents actually makes it to the owner, so people who make money through corporations would be effectively taxed at 45%

REMEMBER THOUGH, employees (you guys) salaries are deducted from pretax net income, so the money the corporation makes that ends up in your pockets will only be taxed once, at most for 35%.

SO, when a man like John Paulson makes his income, it comes out of the AFTER TAX Net Income of the company, because his earnings are benchmarked by the after tax profits of the corporation, not the PRETAX Net Income of the company like most employees.

It may seem like John Paulson is scamming the government out of money he should be paying in taxes because of a loophole. But remember that the money that he made has already been taxed once at the corporate rate, so the amount of money in taxes that he's paying on his income is NOT the total % that the government has taxed.

That is all.
 
























 Haters downvote. But PJIII will rise. 




 I love Barnes. But Curry, Thompson, and Lee are all solid scoring options already. I just can't see him having a big enough role to win ROY. 




 The bobcats have such a lack of scorers in place right now though. I could see him going 15/6/5 on 41% shooting and making a serious run at ROY. I think that'd be his best case scenario. 




 I think one pertinent detail people aren't mentioning: they're giving him a statue because Joe Pa has been the coach at Penn State for 45 years and has won more college football games than any coach in Division 1 history. The man is an absolute legend in his own right.  




 It's not. But it's not replacing commercial breaks, it's in addition to them. 




 It's really difficult to get an idea how good his game is going to translate to the NBA. 90% of those highlights were the result of hilariously bad defenses that he'll never see (unless he's playing Andre Blatche) here. He definitely has unquestionable athleticism, but I think he's going to have some growing pains while he starts to figure out how NBA centers work, and I expect him to have a *much* better 2nd half of his rookie season than first. 




 1. Yes

2. A company whose owner gives money to groups that take an anti-gay rights stance =/= corporate discrimination. 




 Crim pro is easily the most "that's some serious bullshit" class of the 22 I've taken so far. Some of the analysis the justices use is so far removed from reality it's hilarious. 




 Overall not a talented scorer by any stretch, extremely poor free throw shooter, passing skills prowess is inflated (via his assist numbers) because he plays with the big-3 as opposed to, say, Deron's situation in NJ last year.

I don't necessarily agree with those arguments. But those are usually what's brought up.

 The thing about law school: with a couple specific exceptions, nothing you learn is really that difficult. But the pure volume of material you learn, as well as the nature of law school exams make it incredibly rigorous and testing. So it's still hard, but it's not exactly going to ever stretch the bounds of your cognitive faculties. 




 Not really, no. Starting with the market crash in 2008, the legal hiring market didn't see a downturn; it saw a complete structural collapse.

 Egregious Texas trolling. We all know it's top-14. 




 It's funny that, as a Magic fan who has slowly given up on Dwight being a part of our team's future, i've had the exact opposite reaction progression. 




 What on God's green earth just happened? 




 And even then, I think the Wolves are the first team to replace anyone who falls out. And even if two teams fall out, suggesting Curry, Bogut, and Davis Lee are going to stay healthy is an extraordinary suspension of belief. 




 *In 1992*

1. Magic was already retired, and was becoming a serious defensive liability for the Lakers leading up to that point. Chris Paul today is probably the best defensive point guard in the NBA, and overall he's absolutely better than 1992 Magic

2. Scotty Pippen v. Kevin Durant  is impossible to say conclusively in either direction. Durant is plausibly the best pure scorer in the NBA right now, but Scotty Pippen was much better defensively.

3. Larry Bird's back was going out by '92, he was a significantly worse player that year than Westbrook was this year. 

4. I wouldn't call Stockton a better player than Deron; Stockton's legacy comes more from his insane durability and his incredible passing skills, but outside of that he was very one dimensional. Deron is a much better defender (read: average) and is a much more capable scorer as well.

Edit: after going back and looking at Stockton, I'm definitely wrong about him, so nevermind on point 4. 




 That doesn't even make any sense. 




 1. Ryan Anderson is not small... he has the same height/wingspan as Kevin Love.

2. His defensive rebound numbers were low because Dwight is a defensive rebound vacuum.

3. He had 3.7 offensive rebounds a game last year, 5th most in the entire NBA.

4. Why are you talking about Ibaka? They're very differently built players. 




 LOL at CP3 going back to the Hornets. 




 Ummm, you know the Heat *just* won the championship, right?

 A view that correlates with a party's base is not the same thing as an ideological tenet of the party. 




 Yep. Howard has had *no* character problems his first six years (unless you count "being too happy" a character problem). Every negative thing he's done has revolved around his crappy situation with the Orlando Magic management; and I don't entirely blame him, even though he could have handled it much much better. His actual locker room attitude is a non-issue.

 Hey. This guy is against America! Downvote him! 




 I would definitely make two part movie of final fantasy VII. The first one would end right after [game spoiler alert] Aerith's death. I'd probably have to cut out certain events, like most of the more minuscule parts of the journey through the midgar sectors, probably Yuffie/Wutai altogether, and the Cloudless hunts for the huge materia.

Peter Jackson would direct it, because the Lord Of The Rings style of epic is the only way this film could be pulled off. Jeremy Renner would be cast as cloud, Kristen Stewart would be Aerith, Chris Hemsworth as Sephiroth, Carey Mulligan as Tifa, Colin Farrell would be Vincent Valentine, Bryan Cranston as professor Hojo, Brendan Gleeson as the voice of Cait Sith (he's supposed to have an accent), John Hamm as the voice of Red XII, Terry Crews as Barret Wallace, and Bruce Willis as Cid Highwind.

The movie would definitely have 5-6 incredibly surreal Kubrickian long-shots, including the destruction of sector 7, the journey down the northern crater, the flashbacks to nibelhelm and Cloud/Tifa's descent into the lifestream.

This will never happen though :(

 Quick refresher in terms of beliefs: Presbyterians generally believe in reformed theology, which is largely based in [these five points](http://calvinistcorner.com/tulip), that were established above and beyond Luthor's theological break from Catholicism, whereas Methodists, whose theology comes from the reflections of John Wesley (who founded Methodism more as a way of life, trying to be "methodical" about living holy) rejected those views and embraced [Arminianism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arminianism) which is essentially an exact opposite stance all five points previously mentioned. That's how those two differ, anyways.

It's legit guys. 




 That's awesome. Was there a guide of some kind you used to get there? 




 It's not an exemption, just a separate taxable rate. 




 I live in Atlanta. Here it is not. 




 Ugh. This exact moment has prevented me from my lifelong goal of a lvl 1 Excalibur II walkthrough. I hate you (with adulation). 




 Yep. Florida is a great state. And I'd imagine that, controlled for socioeconomic factors, it's about as intelligent as most of the rest of the country (I hold reservations for the Northeast and the West). It's just a great target to knock on. 




 They don't think it be that bad. But it do. 




 Check your sidebar. 




 No, seriously, what the fuck reddit. You've been bitching nonstop since this site was creating about how our due process rights are eroding, how the death penalty is simply wrong (regardless of the level of doubt). And now that people are killing endangered animals instead of humans *you're completely okay with it.*

Shitty hypocrisy is shitty. 




 Prelaw doesn't qualify you for shit either. You need 3 years of law school after that before you're able to take the bar, and you can go to law school from any undergrad degree, so it's not comparable to premed.
 




   I really don't know where to turn to or what even to search.

Getting recommendations for a lawyer would be a great place to start 









 For me personally, I enjoyed the simplicity. I think a lot of times when videogames try and put a complex moral framework around a villain they often fail and it's usually a criticism of the game. FFVI didn't even try; they just went for pure, simple, evil. It's a breath of fresh air.

Not only is abnormal for a villain to be so straight-forwardly evil, but he actually succeeds too. He destroys the world of balance. Those two factors make for a very unique and wonderful villain. 




 What? I was attacking his vague use of "legal loopholes," not the numbers themselves.

He also said "over the past 10 years." So your graph is completely worthless, because the highest marginal rate has been at 35% for 10 years now. 




 The capital gains tax rate isn't a loophole. 




 Not really though. 




 8% geometric return is a complete fantasy land.  




 Just briefly looked up his post history. One of the most curious posting styles I've ever seen in my life. 




 Weird, I've been told i'm "stand offish" and "the guy who doesn't like anybody" 




 At stanford though? 




 Yep. Ignoring is the greatest weapon. 




  Now, as a white male, I feel as if I'm attacked by a black man, I can't defend myself as I'll get screwed legally even in the right.

Calling paranoid parrot. 




 Reading comprehension. We're talking about consistency amongst manuscripts; not the occurrence of the events themselves. 




 Wait... what??? Fair game???? Are you kidding me? 




  This admission that the NT is 0.05% wrong

That wasn't what was stated in the chart; it's claiming that we can only verify, through proper scientific means, as to 99.5% of it. Not that it's only 99.5% accurate. 




 Most of the time, if it's just the post-exam attitude, the person is look at a B. 




 FF9-  :( 




 I honestly wonder about that exchange in retrospect. If Beasly had stayed he couldn't *possibly* have been worse than miller was... right? 




 I don't think he did. 




 Probably just a joke, because it's impossible to have civil discourse over Ron Paul on reddit, generally speaking. 




 I stopped after that fucking eye on day 12, I have to study tonight, does somebody want to tell me if there are anymore creepy images? 




 written*

come on man! 




 IIRC they were 41-41 the year before Thibs/Boozer came. So yeah, I find that hard to call them "contenders." 




 To be fair, the bulls weren't a contending team when he was coaching them. 




 This isn't a logical fallacy of anecdotal evidence dude. When someone makes a claim "all people can float" you only need one data point of "nonfloater" to prove it wrong. 

If the statement was "most people can float" then that's a whole different story. 




 You can disagree, but there are absolutely people out there who simply cannot float, no matter how proper their floating technique is. I'm one of them. 




 per the sidebar: **this is not a forum for soliciting or giving legal advice.** 




 Yeah, because who is Nixon anyways?? 




 ...really? 




  Are you fucking serious? He said the legislation would legalize child pornography. This is as absurd as saying the forth amendment legalizes hiding evidence from cops.

lolwut? 




 That's so cute. 
























 Based on your "corporations are people" and "taxing the church" comment; I think you've got a bit of learning to do yourself before you start lashing out at other people. 




 I'm confused now. What else do German men wear? 




 Let's not forget second best rebounder. 




 Kevin Love *killed* amare and dirk last season, 




 Just enter two line-breaks instead of one to create a new line :) 




 1. **Annie Hall - Woody Allen - 1977**: The greatest comedy ever made, was masterfully composed by its nonlinear storytelling, and the disappointing and undramatic ending hit harder because it made the movie feel so much more grounded in reality despite its hyper-exaggerated quirkiness. Also, just plain goddamn hilarious.

2. **The Godfather parts I and II - Francis Ford Coppola - 1972, 74**: The greatest story ever told in American cinema. While the writing, acting, cinematography, are all near-perfect; the biggest mark is the elegance with which Michael Corleon's transformation is shown. No mafia film since has gone by without avoiding the shadow of this movie's legacy.

3. **North By Northwest - Hitchcock - 1959**: it feels like it was the precursor to the Bond films, but with Hitchcock quality direction. It is the both the essential action movie, and the essential mistaken identity movie.

4. **Barry Lyndon - Kubrick - 1975**: Almost every single scene takes on an otherworldly characteristic with the incredibly beautiful shots of the European countryside. 

5. **Once Upon A Time In The West - Sergio Leone - 1968**: This was the ultimate spaghetti western director at the height of his power. In my (unpopular) opinion, it has both a superior soundtrack and a more mature story than The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly.

6. **There Will Be Blood - P.T. Anderson - 2007**: a performance for the ages by DDL, masterful direction by Anderson, ripe with symbolism and analytically dense. It's a modern day wet dream for movie lovers.

7. **2001: A Space Odyssey - Kubrick - 1968**: I could talk about this movie for hours. It has so many thematic layers hidden behind an extraordinary depiction of space and a brilliantly anthropomorphized robot antagonist. 

8. **Apocalypse Now - Coppola - 1979**: One of the most deep and fascinating explorations of human psychology through the medium of a war, conveyed through an Odyssey-esque journey.

9. **Lawrence Of Arabia - David Lean - 1962**: This is the definitive hollywood epic. The grandiosity is complemented by such a stark contrast in the humane and relatable personal struggle. This is what a 'blockbuster' should be.

10. **Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf? - Mike Nichols - 1966**: there's something sharp and gripping and poignant about the dialogue in this movie. It rips into your soul and surfaces again for air over and over again for 2 hours.

And I really, really, really wanted to put Fargo, Manhattan, It happened one night, and the LOTR trilogy. Ten just isn't enough :( 




 Fuck my life. 

Even if Orlando was going for full on tank-and-rebuild; we could have and should have done a hell of a lot better than Mo Harkless as our young talent acquisition; and we should have found a way to acquire better draft picks than 2017-lottery-protected first rounders. Orlando unequivocally loses huge, no matter which way you look at it. 

Our lineup going into this season looks something like Jameer-Affalo/Redick-Hedo-Big Baby-Gustavo Ayon; with Vucavic, Harkless, Nicholson, and whatever point guard we sign coming off the bench. It's going to be a depressing stretch of 18-28 win seasons for the magic going forward. 




 You are everything that's wrong with America. 




 I'm actually mad at the absurd lack of young talent we're getting for dwight. I really wanted the Rockets to be involved in this trade :/ 




 ...That's not really how cancer works though. 




 Ha ha. You are so inflammatory and masterful with your trolling. It must feel really great. 




 Kareem would like a word with your word with johnydoom. 




 Holy hell. Australia played them tough as nails for 34 minutes and then **BAM!** 




 Is there a box score of this game somewhere that doesn't suck like NBC's? 




 Some very dubious calls going in America's favor -_- 




 I guess the olympic spirit got the best of him. 




 If we're not at our best, it's going to be even worse for you guys when you lose to us :p 




 Greg Reid, now this... *COME ON*

I have this heartbreaking feeling we're going to anomalously be ravaged by injuries/off the field issues for the second season in a row, finish something like 10-3, be ranked in the high-teens, and considered a huge disappointment again.




Okay. So that's probably a bit panicky. I'm just ready for the season to start.  




 I just thought it was a funny general example, because Florida might be the most apocalyptic legal market in the nation right now. 11 law schools + none of them having much/any interstate reach = *nobody* who goes to law school in Florida is reasonable safe the way a lot of "good regional placement" state schools are. 




 You haven't seen Florida's employment stats I'm guessing. The best way to get a job in Florida is to go to a really high ranked school and have contacts and connections in Florida. 




 And be honest. 




 Wait. Which continent are you talking about? 




 Loving the troll flair. 




 That article was awful. 




 It seems like the genuine coolness of the TED empire started declining almost completely in sync with its widespread growth in popularity. It's sad to see TEDx talks that are sometimes legitimately awful; and it's now even more sad to see, as the author put it 'that TED is no longer a responsible curator of ideas worth spreading."' 




 Tax. Not even a competition. 




 Some combination of 

1. Something you're interested in doing, given the very high likelihood of deciding not to go to law school

2. Something that will allow you to maintain the highest gpa possible. Think 3.9-4.0

Depending on your interests, you might be forced to pick one of the two. But if you want to go to law school, having an absurdly high GPA is *enormously* helpful. 

 




 Nope. There's only one way in which "tiers" is used when talking about a law school, and that's in reference to its national ranking. And John Marshall is a tier-4, for what it's worth. 




 tl;dr- if people *tried* harder to get jobs, then more jobs will magically appear. 




 Let A connote "eating a butterfinger" and B represent "you are thirsty." the first part of the statement is simplified to "if A, then B" and the only other logical statement we can create from that is the contrapositive "If not B, then not A" which would expand to "If you are not thirsty, then you did not eat a butterfinger."

So your friend's statement rephased: "if B, then A" does not logically follow from "If A, then B"; is sound logic and he should be congratulated. 




 "Hitherto there has been no thought I have been afraid of; if I should run across such a thought, I hope that I have at least the sincerity to say, 'I am afraid of this thought, it stirs up something else in me, and therefore I will not think it.' If in this I do wrong, the punishment will not fail to follow." 

(Kierkegaard)
 




 Wait.... really? 




 Why are there SO MANY FOULS this game?? 




 The Nigerian defense was so painfully bad... they would have had to start rigging their own shots to miss if they had wanted their fg% to drop below 50%. 




 This title/message is so confusing. WHICH ONE ARE WE SUPPOSED TO RESPOND TO? 




 Some of my favorites right now: Barry Lyndon, Lawrence of Arabia, Once Upon A Time In The West, North by Northwest, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, Apocalypse Now. 

I know what you mean about just doing it to check items off a list, I definitely think there are a handful of films I just watched and moved on from, and are probably already due for a rewatching. But I think having that list there was the best way to just start plunging into cinema from scratch. 









 Aw man, I love the Yuffie sidequest. 




 that scene bugged me, because every time his ex did something to get hotter her hotness axis didn't increase, her crazy axis decreased. 




 At first I thought the author was just saying "you should find more tactful and creative ways of saying these things." But some of his commentary is just really poor and wrong (see: 2, 7). For 4 and 5 he's just contradicting himself by saying that you *should* say them, but don't do it right away. Well, duh.  




 I can understand that. But I think the point is for the rest of the congregation to know to reach out to them. I was visiting a church that did this; and several people came up to talk to me and help get acquainted. It was nice. 




  If he had any decent offensive threats at the 4 and 5

You say that like Carlos Boozer isn't a decent offensive threat? I mean, I understand why the Bulls hate him; but the demonizing is kindof hilarious sometimes. 




 **That's even worse** 




 He's come even farther since Angels in the Outfield. 




 Ew. 




 I've worked there. They don't.  




 If it's any consolation, I hate you on the inside as well. 




 Meh; I think that there are too many good power forwards in the west: Love, Dirk, Aldridge, the manimal, Blake Griffin, Demarcus Cousins, Pau.

Combined with the fact that Anderson went from being the Magic's second scoring option to now having to share the ball with The Brow, Austin Rivers, Eric Gordon, and company. I'd be legitimately shocked if Anderson makes an all-star team while in NO. 




 Eh. Most lists I've ever seen have Kareem above Bird. 




  Just try "hey, how are you" then. Ladies are often interested in the mysterious.

This is actually a terrible idea. Women almost never reply to thoughtless messages, because most of the time they just assume the guy is mass messaging, or under the rationale of "he didn't put in any time for me, so why should I for him?"

The key is to keep it a couple sentences long, ask conversation-starting questions about things she put on her profile, and don't sound stupid. 




 It also gives you a LOT less leeway if you're trying to differentiate between an A- (which is usually 90-92) and A (which is 93+). 




 RYAN ANDERSON COME ON PEOPLE. 




 Ryan Anderson has a much bright future already than Gallinari. 




 At least we still have ~~A great young PF in Ryan Anderson~~  
~~And awesome head coach~~  
~~A ton of cap space to work with~~  
~~Daniel Orton coming along nicely~~  
Hedo Turkoglu! 




 I'm actually pretty positive it was meant in jest, and people upvoting origibanality didn't quite get that, or are willfully ignoring it. 




 Lost in a world of condescending intellectualism through middle school, aficionado of the inner workings of their thought processes by 16. My guess is that now he's about to start his freshman year of college, and spent the summer rigorously outlining his magnum opus "the psychology of man." 




 *redoubles stalking efforts*
 




 Eh, that's not universal. I know a good handful of guys who ended up dating (and subsequently marrying) girls they were good friends with first. 




 Ummm no. The revenue of single stores can come close to 4 million dollars a year. That second number is completely wrong. 




 If by "large portion" you mean like .001% 




 Correct, it's served on a lightly toasted and lightly buttered hamburger bun with pickles. 




 But why make a list of something; and then put a player on that list for criteria completely unrelated to that list?

Not to mention, it's not even a safe assumption. To project he's going to have a better career than someone like Isiah Thomas or Allen Iverson is just *far* from being very likely. 




 How can someone realize that Malone was a 2x MVP, one of which was over '97 Michael Jordan? Not to mention he's second all-time behind Kareem in career points, enjoying one of the longest stretches of quality play *ever*, and still ranking him behind Kevin McHale?

We're talking an 11 time all-nba first teamer vs. 0 time all-nba any teamer.

This is frustrating. 




 This is a list that already has Kevin Durant at #25. I'm not putting much stock into it. 




 Why would your order a spicey chicken sandwich at the original one? They have HAMBURGERS AND FRIED OKRA there. 




 Chick fila's are very likely the most profitable franchises of all fast food in the southeast. A "decent" franchise can see 11k-12k in revenue on a good day. Choosing to franchise a chick fila could have very well been a financial decision, and there was probably no reason to expect boycotts in the near future. 




 Replace dinner table with middle school cafeteria.  




 I don't see too much of a problem with the military acting on a policy of "would be beneficial" rather than "need." Especially since the state of modern warfare is almost completely preventative.  




 No. But Chopin was bad ass. 




 We both share a birthday with Chopin and Justin Bieber. Yeah! 




 TIL I am dyslexic.  




 I feel bad for not knowing if you're being serious. Like maybe there's some paid bible study service somewhere that I've never heard of or something. 




 Rest assured, I am very afraid of how hard you are going to take it on me. 




 Building muscle in conjunction with some cardio, what football players do, is probably more healthy than distance running is. 




 Yep. Also, as a distance runner, the injury stockpile can be incredibly high (in the same realm as football) as well.  




 Yep, also football is so incredibly king in America, I don't think it'll come close to losing that status in the next 40-50 years. 




 wouldn't those be the same option though? 




 Yep. the word "kobe" on a menu means literally nothing about the meat. 




 I think he'll be a fantasy basketball steal this year. 




 Iwasjoking. 




 that's more statisticsy than sciencey; and you don't fuck with statistical validity. 




 Ugh, this subreddit is kindof a mess. 




 No way. Malone was absolutely better than Barkley. They had comparably good peaks, and Malone's absurd longevity gives him a huge edge. 




 Yep, Dwight is still significantly better offensively. 




 Better players =/= bigger roles *or* better stats. 




 I feel like citing to PER will get you mass-downvoted in r/nba. Especially if you mention rondo is ranked 21st among point guards in PER. 




 Make it 7' and I'm in. 




 Nah, most people could get a solid understanding of the relevant (to them) tax code by reading an hour a day for 2-3 months.

It's not like the only way to learn it is to read the freaking code itself either, there are supplements that break it down quite nicely for you. 




 Except recognition on investment income is, in most cases, easily deferred, so your second to last paragraph is pragmatically moot. 




 FWIW, accountants, lawyers, and bankers can all go up to 85-90 hours a week in the "big-4, biglaw, BBB" arena (not often, but not uncommon). 

Lawyers in that field *start* at 160k out of law school in big markets (NYC, DC, some Chicago firms), accountants start 60-90k but have a turtle climb to a much much higher ceiling. I don't know what the starting salary is for big-market banking, but they have by far the highest ceiling of all.  




 This is actually false! For tax purposes your income is only reduced by the amount that interest accrues on those loans. So technically you're making about -850ish a year. 




 teenage parenthood.  




 I've taken about 30 LSAT exams, and I can only remember that being the case once or twice. 




 That's nonsensical though. If you do something, you're still by definition trying to do it first, regardless of your level of confidence. 

When someone says "I'm not going to be able to pick up that rock," "I'll try to pick up that rock," and "I'm going to pick up that rock," they're still going to try to pick up that rock in all three scenarios. The middle one is just a neutral statement of fact without a predictive assertion.  




 You can have R v Dudley and Stephens... Enjoy it. 




 If you be the awesome SO I will definitely marry you.

Note: I will be a *slightly-above-average* SO. 




 Ugh. 




 IIRC there were eyewitness reports of the other team feeding him the ball at the end of the game to get to 100. 




 1. Yeah... that really diminished the coolness, knowing off the top of my head that one of these was definitively wrong.

2. 3 personal jurisdiction. 




 2. Can you cite a source then? Do you see how the second sentence doesn't logically validate the first?

5. If you're making an argument against the death penalty, it seems fair to have complaints that are narrowly tailored against the death penalty; and not broad problems with the entire justice system.

7. Spread out across the nation? That's really not much at all, and that amount would likely be doing nothing right now other than easing municipal and state budget crises to a very small degree. 

-still upvoted you though because discussion is good. 




 Magic had already been retired for a full year when he was on the Dream Team. Bird's back was going out and he was a year away from retiring as well. Either way, that shouldn't shock you for rebounds because  Charles Barkley was a considerably better rebounder than any of the three, which makes sense because he was a power forward and they were a shooting guard, point guard, and small forward respectively. 

Points/steals is still legitimately surprising, but not entirely when you consider that all-star teams tend to lead to historically wonky results; especially with such a high random chance of variation (from such a small set of games). Take for instance the [box score](http://www.usabasketball.com/misc/12_mnt_exh_05_box.pdf) of the latest game between USA and Spain. Carmelo led the team in points despite the fact that he was 6th in the league in [points-per-game](http://espn.go.com/nba/statistics/player/_/stat/scoring-per-game/sort/avgPoints/year/2012/seasontype/2) and all five players in front of him were also on the roster.  




 Your second point doesn't logically follow- It's very possible that it is a deterrent, and is preventing an even *higher* rate of murder. States could 

Your fifth point seems moot because that's true for minorities across just about all non-white collar crimes. So it will only naturally extend.

Your seventh point is just kind of silly because the number of executions multiplied by the difference in cost between a life sentence and a death penalty is negligible compared to just about any program that could create real societal change.  




 I think as a big man being drafted #1 overall, you're kindof inherently expected to be a good rebounder and at least a decent defender. 




 ehhhhh. I think you'd be stupid to say he doesn't even have an argument for top-10 all time, but I don't think he's "easily" top-10. For instance, you could very well make a convincing (or at least, a respectable) argument that 1. Jordan 2. Kareem 3. Wilt 4. Russell 5. Magic 6. Bird 7. Shaq 8. Tim Duncan 9. Oscar Robinson 10. Hakeem 11. Lebron James 12. Karl Malone are better than him on the all time list right now.

I do think he's a top-10 all time player, but you can't deny there's a certain subjectivity to it; and Kobe could definitely be excluded from that top 10 amongst the wiggle room. I could see him being anywhere from 7th to 13th. 




 Not as much, but that statistic about Bowden is wrong as presented. 




 Only in division 1 though. 




 Does that really count as an infographic? 
























 "not that bad" is still probably not going to win more than 20-23 games; which is actually really bad. 




 1. A hornbook could set you back another 150 bucks. Any sort of E E will set you back ~50. If he's including other things that weren't included (law in a flash- flash cards) that's another 40-50. 

2. New books here are around 180; I think 150 is an underestimate. Granted, I still think 9,000 is really stretching it. I'm probably spent 2500 as a 1L, 1500 as a 2L, and will spend about 800 as a 3L. If I had gotten every textbook + recommended hornbook + E E + some nutshell + law in a flash for all classes in which they were recommended, I think I could have broken 9k.

3. American books are much prettier than their Australian counterparts. 




 x_x sorry about this thread then. 









 For some reason, all the thrift stores I've been to here in my city are all extremely poor quality, I've lost faith in local thrift shopping. 




 laughs at you for using 'relevancy'

feels like an idiot after discovering relevancy is a word. 




 I'm looking to accumulate ~4 Fair Isle sweaters that are 'fashionably ridiculous' for this fall; but it's hard to track down a decent variety. Does anyone have any suggestions? Or any absurd ones they've recently come across? 




 I'm wondering this too. 




 Then we blow like... four. 




 I feel like dark shades of blue usually work best with light/medium grey. So a light grey v-neck sweater, nice blue jeans and some leather shoes. Or maybe a grey blazer with a white button down underneath. 




 Excellent. Thanks a ton. I found [these](http://www.florsheim.com/shop/style/18150-03.html) on florsheim, but they look too shiny. Is there any specific type of material I should be looking for in a shoe that is basically signifies it doesn't have a formal-shoe level of shine to it? 




 Inspiration is this- http://i.imgur.com/rh8IW.jpg

I've found these- http://shop.nordstrom.com/S/allen-edmonds-clifton-oxford/2892042?origin=category contextualcategoryid=0 fashionColor=WALNUT resultback=0 but on a student living budget, it's *really* difficult to justify the price. Does anyone know where I can find something very close in looks for around 150-200? Or maybe know of a good place to buy used Allen Edmonds?

I especially enjoy the walnut color and the simplicity of the toe. Unlike the 'strand' oxfords. 




 I think it was the "streets of new york" part that made everyone think he was asking for it, rather than "what kind of shoes would work with this suit". 




 At least you *can* beat bad teams. 




 That's.. ummm... overaggressive, don't you think? 




 Medium. 




 Definitely extra slim. I'm 6'3 150 and extra slim is still a little baggy on me, but that's the skinniest they have. If you get a small it'll be about 1.5 inches too short on the sleeves. 




 6'3 150 checking in. Life is not fun. 




 Ours is pretty easy to justify-

1. We were going to have an awesome 2nd week game with West Virginia... then they bailed.
2. Florida, obviously our yearly rival game
3. USF was also *supposed* to be at least a decent-level FBS opponent
4. Murray State- every team is allowed 1 cupcake 




 Hey buddy, relax. If we're better than the three teams ahead of us, it'll show up as the season progresses. No need to pitch a fit about only being ranked 4th in the 4th week of the season. 




 Wait, what? Wake is 3-1 with a win over UNC, no less. Boston College is the 'lol' team of our division. 




 Errr, that sounds nice, but it's more just that those specific games were historically significant. For instance [the choke at doak](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choke_at_Doak). 




 Depends on the occasion. For a business/professional/interview event, both of them are too informal and will look bad with a suit. For a less formal occasion; you might have some leeway, but you'd have to post pictures of the suit, and I get the feeling they probably won't.  




 Agree with you on the first paragraph. Still think it looks sophomoric and ugly on OP. 




 FSU returned a lot more starters than Clemson did though. 




 You're violating the spirit of the thread bro. 




 Or. Maybe he's just a dumb troll. 




 Typically when you join a society, there will be networking events with accountants there from all the firms (big 4, GT, BDO etc.) This is nice because building a repertoire with recruiters and accountants can only ever help you. 

At worst, you're going to have a better looking resume by joining a society, and by going to these events you'll get insights and advice that will make you a better interviewee. Ask them what they want in an intern/hire- then convey those traits back to them during your interview with the firm.

At best, your relationships will directly affect whether you get an interview or not; and you could even have already established a professional friendship with the guy who interviews you or one of your callback partners.

You *really* want, when your resume is being reviewed, to have the recruiter (or whoever) to look at your application and say "240drift is a sociable and easy to talk to person who asks intelligent questions and seems to enjoy this profession" instead of "I have no clue who this is, despite appearing on his campus multiple times, so we'll just have to screen him solely on the merits of this piece of paper." The odds of you getting an internship/callback/offer with the former is SIGNIFICANTLY higher than the latter, when you have a bare-bones resume and only your gpa working for you. Remember that your gpa is a part of your resume, not the whole thing. Why risk something as monumentally important as post-graduation employment by only having a partially good resume?

Would I really have THAT much trouble finding a good job after I graduate if all I have are my grades?

Think about it like if you were considering asking a girl to be your girlfriend, where GPA=looks. You have a certain threshold, and the more attractive she is than that threshold the more you want her. But you're going to be committed to a serious relationship, if she has absolutely no personality, no mental stability, and when making the choice to pursue her you don't know anything about her past and if she has any baggage, you'll probably want to stay away in spite of her good looks; afterall, you have your pick of girls, so you can take one that's not quite as cute but has a solid 9-5 job and you know is fun to be around. Just like an accounting firm- your gpa will make you attractive to them because you're probably above their threshold; but with *no* extracurriculars and no volunteer work working for you, and no idea who you are outside of this piece of paper you've sent in to be reviewed- they're going to be a lot more hesitant to consider you for this relationship, and probably settle for someone else.

I know the abstract idea of networking gets pounded into the heads of college students; and it's either scares them, or they decide in their infinite wisdom that it's not worth it. But in the world of job efficacy, this is the lowest hanging fruit out there.

tl;dr- Join your schools accounting society, put on a button down shirt, paste a smile on your face, and meet people. You'd be foolish not to, it makes a huge difference. 




 To be fair; the code of federal securities law is, in my opinion, considerably more difficult than the tax code. And the SEC administering is considerably less efficacious than the IRS. So when the general sentiment is that people hate the current code; I can understand strong feelings against sec. reg. 




 Ever heard of a dude named Steve Spurrier? 




 I'm 6'2 155 pounds, and almost all dress shirts I try on fit my frame but are too short in the torso and sleeves, or are long enough on the measurements but hang off of me like a parachute. 

I know BrooksBrothers has a decent extra-slim fit line, because my only three good dress shoots are from there. But I'm looking for some other lines of shirts that fit slim for the extra-lanky of us. I couldn't find anything in the sidebar or the (awful) search function.

Does anyone have any shirt lines that are good for us toothpicks?

Edit: and to go a step further, I'm especially looking for a light blue button down, but any general brand suggestions would be great. 




 You sound childish. 




 1) I only mentioned that because you said creaming 2 FCS schools doesn't tell you anything, you failed to mention we also creamed an FBS opponent that was 2-0, including a win against an ACC rival. Oregon, Oklahoma, West Virginia, all have considerably more shaky bodies of work right now.

2) I never said the transitive property doesn't exist. Good teams have bad games and lose by small margins to vastly inferior teams. VT got soundly worked, and clearly lost in the trenches to a team that, going into this game, had two pathetic losses. Having VT still ranked right now is just absurd. 




 How? between the 6 opponents of our two teams, Wake has been by far the strongest, and we just absolutely crushed; whereas oregon is giving up 24 points a game to Tennessee Tech, Arkansas State, and Fresno state.

And another: we've outscored Oregon so far this year too. 




 To be fair. FSU isn't the team spotting 34 points to FCS schools 




 How did you have FSU ranked 22nd preseason?? 




 1. Wake Forest could probably tell you a little bit

2. You failed to mention in there that they lost to a team that got whooped by Youngstown State. You have enough information to know that other teams have lost to much better quality opponents then freaking 1-2 pittsburgh.  




 Wat. We beat a conference opponent, a 2-0 conference opponent, who had another win against another conference opponent UNC. We beat them 52-0. We out-gained them in yardage 612 to 126. We held the 'quarterback of  week 2 in the ACC' to 8/22 for 82 passing yards. We held them to 1.2 yards per rush, and that includes a 34 yard run 2 minutes into the game.

52-0 dude. 




 I hate to leach off the main question- but I'm way too poor for the near future to afford boots like these. Does anyone know where I can find something that looks very similar but less? Or is this just the expected price to pay for a pair of boots.

Edit: I should clarify that I'm in love with that color scheme of the leather/soul/laces specifically; moreso than the exact shape of the boot. 




 Yep. Overall the suit looks very sloppy. I'll add that it's noticeably more tight around the stomach than it is where the vents are, making the whole lower half of the suit curve weird. 

Combined with the fact that it's a three button suit... eh, I wouldn't wear it. 




 FSU-UF

1. One of the best rivalries in the nation

2. Ee went through four humiliating years of getting trounced by them, and then once we got our act together they just completely lost their offense and we've trounced them right back. This year I think is the first time we get a really sweet game between the two teams in close to a decade.

3. The gators could plausibly be the last great stand preventing us from going to the NCG, which would exponentially increase the stakes of the game, and could make or break both of our seasons.

 This is exactly what I'm thinking too. Clemson's D doesn't look so great, I think FSU can put up a lot on them. But then Clemson has so many goddamn frightening offensive weapons, there's no way we're keeping the score low, nation's best defense or not. 

But now I feel like a homerdouche and a jinxer by picking my team to win by 24 over a top-ten ranked opponent, so I'm not sure.  




 I love you. 




 Those light brown shoes behind the row of cordovans. Can you tell me where you got those, and/or if they're online somewhere? 




 To be fair. FSU *hammered* an AQ team that's looking to be decent this season. 




 I will never for the life of me understand why that wasn't a complete pass. 




 I remember hearing that a lot about a year ago too :( 




 Right, everyone knows we're going to be playing Oklahoma; the key piece to our 2011 vengeance tour. 




 Living in Georgia now for two years; and frequent Alabama- Tallahassee is worse than both by a non-negligent amount. 




 No way. Yuffie has the best date scene, because it's so awkward between them.

Yuffie fo life. 




 Depends on what school you're at. 




 This is much much more truthful than the comment you were responding to, thank you. 




 So were the two clauses immediately preceding it.

*cough* spotting bowling green two legitimate touchdowns *cough* 




 It might just be the lighting, but those shoes look too shiny to match that outfit. Pre-distressed jeans look bad, go for a darker color. Shave. Overall not bad though. 




  T-shirts (and probably all upper wear) fitting is 95% in the shoulders.

Sadly, this varies. As a lanky 6'2 150 pound male, I'm constantly running into either a) having a shirt fit perfectly in the cut and the shoulders, only to find that it's way too short in the torso, often ending at the very top of the belt *or* b) having the shirt fit in the shoulders and be long enough, only to hang off my body like I'm wearing a camping tent. 




 I've actually been looking for a reasonably priced blazer like that for a while now... so if anyone has any suggestions, I'd be all ears. 




 Ponder isn't looking very accurate. Does not feel good man :/ 




 Holy hell they did it!!!! 




 Might want to switch to something harder soon.

 Three in one game! His career is **over**. 




 Can you be a little bit more specific- what prep books did you use for which sections? Were they sufficient? Where were they lacking? 




 I'm in grad school and I'd like to get my CPA for a tertiary purpose, and I qualify to sit for my state's exam. I'm a very proficient self-studier, but I'm on a student's budget which means that I can't afford Becker's full review course. Ever something like Yaeger which is $1800 is a huge financial strain to me.
I saw that Wiley's review is absurdly cheap (150 for the whole thing), but given the price, I'm extremely skeptical of its quality as a good comprehensive review course.
Do you think it's reasonably doable, given that I put in the necessary time, to pass the four sections with this book alone? If not, would anybody want to recommend some of the next-cheapest alternatives? Thanks in advance for your help. 




 I'm in law school-

1. Corporate law, or any transaction field of law is very difficult to get into with the way the legal market is right now. I'd say over 50+% of all 3rd year students are struggling to find *anything* at graduation, must less a job in a transaction field. This is exacerbated for areas like corporate because the majority of corporate legal work is done at "biglaw" firms, which are the highest paying and most prestigious places to go after law school. 

2. Because of that, and because of the esoteric highering model of biglaw firms going after the best schools, while shunning lower ranked schools (see [here](http://www.law.com/jsp/nlj/PubArticleNLJ.jsp?id=1202483173162 LAW_SCHOOLS_REPORT) for a ranking of the top-50 schools by biglaw hiring rate), I would argue that you'd be wasting an enormous amount of time and money by going to law school unless you attend one near the top.

3. Fortunately or unfortunately, law school admissions is very very heavily dependent on your "numbers" (that is, your GPA and your LSAT score). See for instance- http://gulc.lawschoolnumbers.com/stats. The graphs will give you an idea first of how closely correlated numbers are with admissions, and second what kind of stats you'll need to be competitive at the harder schools. You can also start seeing things like how Northwestern loves a high LSAT + work experience while UVA loves gpa.

4. My advice would be to talk to people in the profession about what the profession is like; get general knowledge and try and educate yourself as to whether or not you want to be a corporate lawyer. If you decide you do, take the LSAT, and study for it like *crazy*. The LSAT is a very learnable test, and spending tons of time working through the [powerscore bibles](http://www.amazon.com/PowerScore-LSAT-Logic-Games-Bible/dp/0980178207) (which, unlike what you'll find with the CPA, is actually the universal consensus credited study guide) and taking 25-30 practice tests (they publish actual old exams for pretty cheap) you can go from being awful to doing quite well. Granted, this alone is going to take 2-3 hours of study a day for about 4 months; but you'd be a fool not to put in the time because a single LSAT point can be the difference between admission and waitlist/rejection from the school you want to get into.

All in all, it's a long and arduous journey, so best of luck to you. 




 As someone who's generally very shy and introverted; this is a huge fear of mine. Would love to hear feedback. 




 Hell, I'd take Jameer Nelson, Jose Calderon, Lin, Jennings, Jarrett Jack, Rodney Stucky, Tyreke Evans, Darron Collison, Dragic, and Kemba Walker over Chalmers too. 




 I would disagree with your disagreement of yourself. You gave some specific examples of some of the types of problems that pervade poor and minority ethnicities in America.

I think it's just important for people to understand that, while obviously this is not true for everyone within any disadvantaged ethnicity, and while people definitely are able to overcome those disadvantages, there should be *nothing* controversial about suggesting that when you have these debilitating factors occurring at a much higher rate, you're going to have issues like crime, STD transmission, and poverty rising at a higher rate.

It's also important for people to not ignore or be ignorant to the lack of culture that we established, and the intensity of the systematic discrimination for black people specifically that disallowed them to just "overcome" these disadvantages like other ethnicities have (asian populations in california etc.) 




 False. The Beatles were considerably more influential. 




 This for some reason makes me think of two guys work in finance. One tells the other to "run to biglaw." As though either are a reasonably easily achievable option for someone to just run to. 




 Not to mentioned, that idea is only about about 6 minutes worth of show. 




 I'm not annoyed by them, it's just an 'aww that's cute' sentiment. I still remember [making memes](http://i.imgur.com/5ddfY.jpg) as a 1L. 




 1. How are you going to do this when the professor assigns "pages 43-87" in the reading? 




 Here come the 1L memes. 




 ESPN's Sports Science is one of the more stupid things that has ever existed. 




 Yep, pushes the movie to be being too long in length, and the french plantation just doesn't fit with the rest of movie. I'm glad it was left out. 




 I agree, and I upvoted for that excellent response. I was just merely explaining his PER. 




 Sounds like a British person came up with that quote to make us think they did anything.  




A^M^E^RICA!!!!!!

Edit: Joke people. I was joking. I know British intelligence played a huge part in WWII 




 Affalo may score close to 20ppg, just because the Magic are starving for a scoring option. But to be masochistic about this season- he still had a below average PER, and taken in concert with the fact that when he was on the floor last year the Nuggets allowed 106.11 points per 100 possessions, and when he was on the bench they allowed 103.6; which makes me think he's not that great of a defender in spite of his reputation.

Aside from that, I think the Bobcats are hard to say because nobody has any clue how good of a player MKG is going to be next year, we have no bearing on him in the NBA. The Sun's Gortat is probably the single most underrated center in the league; he fits the position of a classic big man extremely well in decent blocking, great rebounding, and a very respectable set of post moves. I think he's one of the top-5 centers in the league.

So I think the Magic have a good chance of winning this competition. 




 I'd put Jefferson and Monroe above both Hibbert and Lopez. 




 First let me say that I love Rondo, and he's much much better than his PER; but it goes deeper than just him being a distributing PG. I'm going to focus on the negative aspects of his game, but I'll say up front that I love him and still think he's one of the 3-4 best pg's in the league regardless.

So. Rondo has a low shooting rate, sure, but that's for two good reasons. The first is that he's always had great scoring options around him, the big 3. That's a definite reason his PER is lower but is not a detriment to his ability as a player.

The second, and very damning reason, is that he's not a good scorer.  His true shooting percentage is *terrible* for a point guard. Rondo has the lowest TS% percentage of all 30 point guards who are above the league average (15) in PER. Amongst those 30, and excluding John Lucas who played less than 15mpg, the next lowest is John Wall who is still a considerable .019 above him. And the fourth worst of those 30, Tyreke Evans, shot  .029 above him, which is quite a wide chasm.

His fg%, while not awful, is still below average, and that's taking into account the fact that he can't stretch the floor with threes, and his mid-range game is still very weak. It's even less pretty considering how little comparative defensive attention he gets because, as mentioned above, he has such a wealth of scoring options around him. If he were to carry a greater offensive onus for his team, it would probably be even lower. Even worse than that, his free throw shooting is *horrendous*. Below 60% last season. That ranks him 116th out of 119 players last season who shot enough free throws for a statistically qualifying sample. The next lowest point guard, Devin Harris, shot 15% better than him from the line.

His inability to score hurts triply so 1. Because coaches will smartly not put him in an offensive scheme to be used as a scoring option, because he's so inefficient 2. TS% is directly taken into account for PER 3. scoring is the strongest way to affect your PER.

So while Rondo is the perfect example of the ways in which PER can be "broken", the reasons his PER are low do represent legitimate and serious shortcomings to him as a player. I think the general sentiment is that they are way overblown as a numerical representation of his shortcomings, and I tend to agree with that. 




  talk to a lawyer

There it is. 




 and rebounds, which I don't think many people quantify as an offensive statistic. 




 Aaaaaand his posts are gone. 




 Could be worse. 




 When do the results come out? 




 Yep. Our franchise doesn't suck at all. Even during that down period after shaq in the early 2000's we could have very easily established an awesome team with Tmac, Grant Hill, Horace Grant, Darrell Armstrong, and an emerging Mike Miller. But injuries ravaged us.

Also franchises that suck don't go on 4 year stretches of averaging 55.5 wins a season. 




 We made the finals a little while ago :(. Not bad for a city with like 12 people in it. 




 Orlando- 3rd richest owner in the league. Proven to be willing to spend that money for his team.

**WE WILL NOT STAY DOWN LONG** 




 That just about exactly how Magic fans felt about Dwight back in '08 




 FBI jobs requiring a JD are hyper competitive. FBI jobs not requiring a JD render law school worthless. 




 I'd like to see it tried. But this sub might be too immature; and the nature of basketball- that it inherently creates more argument- might mean they all turn into shitshows. I can see really posts getting downvotes by team homers, simply because the post is trying to show both sides of the coin.

Also, I think the format should be a little different. Unlike the more random nature of football, it's usually pretty easy to narrow down who the 4-5 contenders are at the beginning of the year and almost always be right. 




 Awwwww Yissssss

Just kidding though. It always sucks to see players decommit. 




 I think a great way to start researching would be [here, on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org) 




 "Hey reddit, do this thing for me"

downvote. 




 Why are you posting this here? This has nothing to do with being reformed? Why are you posting this anywhere? I'm sure a quick google search would lead you to YEC websites that attempt to give explanations.

 I once said CP3 was definitely better than Rondo and ended up at -4. This sub is weird like that. 




 Oh look. Spain with their prissy little acting schtick again. Adding so much to this game. 




 The foul-call rate is too damn high. 




 Ibaka playing? Did Spain's head coach read the Bill Simmons article yesterday? 




 JESSE EISENBERG SIGHTING 




 Sure it can. Lou Williams was a hell of a lot more efficient at scoring and getting to the line than Nick Young is; that's still a downgrade. 
























 Has a team (other than us) ever been ranked 6th in both human polls and unranked in two computer polls this late in the season? Ridiculous. 




 How has Clemson underperformed? they're 9-1 and their only loss was to us. But VT, yeah, no argument there. 




 INORITE? 




 Has a team (other than us) ever been ranked 6th in both human polls and unranked in two computer polls this late in the season? Ridiculous. 




 *2-2, against the #4 team in the nation. Nice try though.

 EJ may have underthrown both bombs so far, but to be fair, he was in the process of being tackled during both throws.

 Highest rated kicker in this years class. I don't see it happening. It's okay though, we have another awesome kicker waiting in the wings. 




 When was Varajao ever selected as an all-star while he was on the team with Lebron? 




 That last outfit; do you have any idea where the parts are from? I love it to death. 




 Yep. Sexual assault =/= assault. Not to mention a lot of jurisdictions have blended the two torts together anyways so assault could have been a valid here absent the sexual nature of the offense; even though the whole point is moot because it's all American law and they're not in America. Not to mention we're all talking in colloquial definitions and not strict legal ones anyways. 




 1984 at number one made me skeptical, Lord Of the rings at #2 made me very skeptical, then I saw the hunger games and stopped taking it seriously. Then I realized 50 shades of grey was ranked above Madam Bovary and I stopped considering it a list.

 All of this plus one little thing- that knot looks bad because it's so small. Try going for a full windsor. 




 I'd just like to point out right now that our 7 man rotation currently comprises four shooting guards and three power forwards. 




 Hrmmm. You win this one. 




 That's one of the least specific majors you can possibly get. 




 Notice how I didn't compare them to FSU in any way, shape, or form? 




 Still. They've played 3 teams this season with winning records, and lost all 3 of those games. 




 Me too. But I still understand what a joke is. 




 I love Pale Fire, and I think that's amazing. I'm honestly shocked Lolita isn't higher up in this thread though. 




 As an FSU grad who grew up in Orlando, this man would bring more happiness to me than you can imagine. 




 Excellent. Thank you.

 Meh. The Vegas over/under on their season after Harden is like 35 wins. They're up with Minnesota/Dallas on that "punchers chance for the 8th seed" level right now. 




 And even if it's acceptable, it looks bad. 




 You learned this from Mad Men. Be honest. 




 Who's projecting us to lose to Florida again? 




 To be fair. That sounds like one of the most logical reasons possible for a man to want to commit suicide.

"I'm going to spend the rest of my life in prison *and* my family is going to die poor *or* I can commit suicide and they'll at least be well provided for. 




 I basically pulled all the probabilities out of my ass. 




 Do you know that, with Jonas Jerebko, Monroe, and Villanueva, he'll get 30 minutes a game? Something rookies *rarely* get, especially ones that are as raw as he is. 




 *classic* ACC style football. 




 I just did a rough calculation of our BCS title game chances. Assuming  
1) Alabama wins out, including UGA in the SECCG (%75)  
2) We win out (~60%)  
3) no team behind us is going to jump us  
4) KSU, ND, and Oregon need two losses for us to jump them.  
5) we pass USCe after our win over florida + ACC championship game

There is like a 10% chance KSU gets at least two losses and a 15% chance Oregon gets at least two losses. There's about a 12.5% chance that ND loses two more times.

If we assume (incorrectly) that all of these are independent probabilities, that puts our title chances at .75 x .6 x .1 x .15 x .125 = .085% and that's being very optimistic


:( 




 Heh, I didn't say it. I'll be rooting for you guys, the enemy of my enemy is my bro.  




 This is one of those "it's so far fetched you shouldn't even feel offended" scenarios. 




 Sagarin's overall rankings are made up of two formulas. ELO_Chess only takes into account who you've beaten and who you've lost to without regard to by how much. Then Predictor, which only takes into account margin of victory and completely disregards whether you've won or lost. The two are averaged out somehow, and comes up with his ranking, which is still a bit quirky, but pretty good for a computer. 

The BCS decided to only use the ELO_CHESS portion of his formula for their computer ranking. I don't know the reason, I think the idea *might* be to correct for the amount of human bias pollsters can put into their rankings or something. It's a very weird decision though, IMO. 




 I know, I was playing along. 




 Or Kansas State winning out. 




 Be honest though, how far down the list did you really look? 




 And when you beat South Carolina and we beat UF that will eliminate a bunch more :D 




 It should also be noted that computers completely disregard MOV (I think, if they do, then it is to a negligible amount). So for instance, Texas moved up on you guys this week, because Kansas is rated higher generally in computer polls than Colorado is. 




 Computers don't GAF about margin of victory though. 




 The fact that they are still only using Sagarin's ELO_CHESS computer has been, and always will be, goddamn retarded. 

His rankings in *Week 9* when computers are supposed to actually start making sense.

1. KSU  
2. Notre Dame  
3. Florida  
4. LSU
5. Oklahoma  
6. UGA
7. Alabama  
8. Oregon  
9. South Carolina  
10. TTU  
11. Oregon State  
12. Stanford  
13. WVU  
14. Arizona  
15. TAMU  
16. Texas
17. Washington   
18. USC
19. Nebraska
20. Iowa State  
21. Miss. State.  
22. Oklahoma State
23. Michigan  
24. Louisville  
25. UCLA  

With Florida State, Clemson, Boise State, and Louisiana Tech unranked.  




 South Carolina in 8th is hilarious. Other than that, no real complaints. 




 Dude, bleacherreport. That simulation has us behind UF in both human polls, but we're in front of them in both human polls. 




 TBH I am confused to. I don't think anyone knows for sure exactly what happened (i.e. Dwight may have said he would refuse to resign with the Rockets which was a condition of their offer, maybe our front office hated the idea of having Brooks Lopez's max contract on the books and making us better enough to hurt our rebuilding draft chances). Ultimately I am confuse as well. 




 Uhh, we resigned Jameer because we needed a starting PG, and with JRich and Dwight gone we're not worried about cap space, and they're both still serviceable players. There is nothing wrong with letting them both play out there contracts while we start acquiring young talent. 




 Then... why are you posting this in the coaches poll thread? 




 Wait. Where are you seeing these BCS rankings? 




 Right. Bounces = fumbles lost v. fumbles recovered. 




 We are the tattoos worth it? 




 Rob Hennigan wasn't involved in the trade, it was executed by the Magic's CEO/President. Also, lol at linking to the bleacherreport as proof of anything ever. 




 Nobody seems to be mentioning it, but this isn't surprising at all, nor does it mean the Thunder are losing him. It's part of the negotiation and the Thunder are probably going to up the salary + other incentives that don't count against the cap (i.e. bonuses for making all-star team, making the finals, winning 6th man again etc.), which is exactly what they did for Ibaka. 




 and they would all suck from the comparative lack of activity. 




 gyro? 




 Jeff Driskel??

He's averaging 132 passing yards and 1.14 touchdowns a game. 




 I think he's surprised they're still so high. 




 Typing this from a phone so forgive the errors and brevity-

I love this film because there's a perspective here that a lot of people seemed to miss: I see this story as told *through the lense* of the main character, a 9 year okd boy scout.

Think about the characters. The girl's parents are lawyers, so what do they do lying in bed? They talk about boring adult lawyer things. Edward Norton is shown as having an immensly crisp routine as scoutmaster, because a young boyscout would see his scoutmaster as being comparatively a robot. Notice how resourveful he is when they're travelling through the woods? He likes to see himself as a person caoable of surviving in the woods, and her as some silly girl who doesn't now how to pack or prepare for real wilderness. Notice how 'social services' is represented by a cold, mean old lady? That's exactly the kind of personification a 9 year old would have of a social services worker. Notice how innocuous the afair was represented? It's because that's what having affair is to him.

I see this not as an objective story with a caraciturized cast, but as a story told through the imaginative mind of a young boy.

 I'm struggling because on one hand this really isn't the spirit of truereddit; but that was a goddamn excellent relevant lyric. 




 This article was, as a whole, quite sloppy. The comparisons to Venice  were very weak as well.  




 Just out of curiosity, why? He's an incredibly talented "game managing" quarterback for a conservative play-calling offense. He's not a Geno Smith hand-cannon by any means, but he's a very solid decision maker. 




 Ha, okay. I guess you clearly have a well-painted picture of how good FSU is in your head already so I won't argue with you anymore. See you Nov. 24th. 




 Sure.

We're 6-1 with our only loss coming by one point on the road to a team who's 4-2 right now. We've beaten a team that's currently ranked (13th USA, 14th AP).

We have the 6th best scoring offense in the nation, (you can point to the fact that we've played two AA teams this year, but I'd rebut by saying one of them ended with 20 minutes left so it someone mitigates stat-inflating). We're ranked 12th in the nation in total offense (23rd passing, 16th rushing; so incredibly well balanced). Also our quarterback is currently ranked 4th in the nation in passing efficiency. 

We have the 4th best total scoring defense in the nation, allowing 11.6points/game. We're ranked 3rd in the nation in total defense; including being 5th overall in rushing defense and 3rd in passing efficiency defense. 

Our strength of schedule isn't great, sure, but it's not awful either. I'd say collectively that's a resume of a top-25 team at least. 




 Yeah; because ignoring margin of victory is **so** logical. And "we were supposed to be really good" is clearly the only argument Clemson and FSU have for being ranked in the top-25. 




 Both ACC teams received perfect .000% in the computer polls. I fucking hate the computer polls. 




 Yeah, I was looking at the AP, ah well. 




 FUCK. 




 I wanted us to move up though :( 




 NERLENS NOEL aka Dwight 2.0 aka Shaq 3.0

 That's *really* stretching 'stacked' territory. We have the quantity, we're lacking in actual quality. 




 No way on earth Magic get to 35 wins this year. 




 I've just started studying for the REG portion of the CPA, my first section. I've never filled out a tax form before, I don't know how to use excel very well, and I the Wiley book I'm reading from doesn't give me much help in the way of how to perform a search SIM.

What are the best ways to prepare for the REG exam in these areas? 




 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71wCKbjU8Q 




 Just out of curiosity, does anyone know generally how often callbacks lead to offers with the big-4? Or maybe any sort of literature on the subject itself? 




 Isn't it still going to be used to determine the who goes to the playoff? Or am I way wrong here. 




 Yep. Would not recommend pulling the trigger on anything like these. 




 1. Your one loss is no longer to a top-3 team

2. It took really really late in the game to pull away from GT; a very bad GT. 




 Except he completely missed Final Fantasy IV, VI, IX and X; all of which are considered to be 'classics' 




 Nice sloooow starts, all around. 




 no! 




 Clemson, come on! You are our one claim to legitimacy right now. You **CANNOT** lose this game. 




 Given the hours and pay of the legal profession, especially for younger lawyers (and excluding biglaw about the pay part), you really have to love it or it will eat you. 




 At the high school level... 

1) there are so many things so absurdly more important than Wickard for a government class; to spend 3% of the entire school year on it is a horrendous misappropriation of time

2) like you said, I doubt it's even on the radar for the AP U.S. history exam

3) Inasmuch as a high schooler who's just now learning about the governent is concerned; there is probably about 10-15 minutes worth of good substantive teaching that they could understand about it. 




 There's a very good argument that Miranda rights are prophylactic anyways. 




 Spending a week on Wickard in high school would make his class one of the worst AP high school classes in existence. 




 But then he would only win it like 40% of the time, which gives brings the expected payout of his scheme over time down to $200 per trial; which means that in the long run he only makes like 200 bucks doing this. 




 fffffffuuuuuuuu 




 I have a couple of interviews coming up this week with the big 4, and I really don't have much of an idea how to research pertinent information on a firm. I'm specifically interviewing for tax positions, and so I'd like to be able to bring up relevant facts and/or recent accomplishments.

Can someone point me in the right direction? 




 Awesome. Thanks! 




 Just about all the scores are messed up. It says FSU is 3-0 when they're 5-0. 




 Is that an ESPN manufactured controversy I hear brewing? 




 Is he the same guy that made a post consisting of nothing all his shoes and shoe-cleaning equipment, and announced that today he was going to be cleaning his giant collection of nice shoes?

If yes, all I have to say is this guy is way too proud of his curious life priorities. 




 Somewhat related- but one of the things that MFA seems lacking the most is good taste in ties. 




 That was fun while it lasted :/ 




 The name Jacksonville State gives me nightmares. Those were dark times. 




 Our lack of ability to play shut-down defense right now is really annoying. 




  I'm going to start wearing a mink fedora  

Oh god.
 I have to start dressing like an adult  

You're off on the wrong foot then
 my goal is to be as sharp as possible  

The really really wrong foot
 while never having anyone look at me thinking "what's going on with that guy's outfit?"  

Troll confirmed
 
























 Yeah, FSU fans have experience with OK fans who are able to travel to an away game in Tallahassee; so typically the older, wealthier, and more hospitable fans.

I went to that game and every OK fan was awesome and really nice. 




 Yep, with UVA and Michigan being really close behind them. 




 Nah, it's even worse if you just started working out because you can't really push yourself *that* hard the first month. 20 pounds your first two months is straight up impossible, and he's probably greatly exaggerating. 




 I would say Rondo is, most generously, the 7th best point guard in the league.  
His TS% is awful, because he can't make free throws or shoot with any real range, and that's not only a huge liability in the late game, but it puts him altogether in the bottom quartile of all point guards in the league in scoring ability.  
His off the ball defense is not good (it's not awful, but it's not a redeeming quality for him), and he often makes plays that are more likely to get him an assist than will actually help his team.

CP3, Rose, Westbrook, Irving, Curry, and Parker are unequivocally better than he is right now. I would say he's in a tier with Jrue Holiday, Rubio, and John Wall (might not be better than him yet, but will probably be eventually); and Deron Williams and Steve Nash (might not be better than him anymore, but definitely was in recent history).

I think 8th-10th is just right for him.
 




 I upvoted you- but could you add an explanation? Opinions are always better when you have a corresponding justification. 




 Let's have a thread where people don't downvote things because they disagree with them. I want to hear people's thoughts and thought processes that seem to go against the grain of the general consensus.

 Similar to you- the reformed/arminian debate was a semi-hot topic of discussion in my ministry my sophomore year of college. I (unwittingly) led the arminian side of the debate, arguing that it was incompatible with free will.   
Someone finally asked me if I knew the scriptural inspiration for reformed theology, I admitted I didn't. They  challenged me to read "What Is Reformed Theology?" by R.C. Sproul, and so I did. I did a complete 180 over the course of the two days that I read that book; and a week later I read it a second time. Haven't looked back since.  




 Title says it all- I need a pair and I'm looking to do so on a pretty tight budget. 




 If you're on TLS- reading arrow's/scribe's guides probably have a much much much better correlation with law school success than LSAT score, haha. Either way, good luck to you.  




 The other thing I've thought about is attending a school where I am over-qualified should help with academic success. Especially with a curve. I understand a lot of it is effort and hustle, but competing against people with a 155 LSAT is way different than a 165 LSAT. Not to make the test everything, but I think its safe to say in general a higher LSAT usually means smarter. Am I wrong to think that I would have a better shot at success at the lower ranked school?  

Yes. You're completely wrong. The correlation between success in LS and LSAT score is weak enough that if you're within 5-6 points of the median then you have no real advantage the rest of the field at finishing near the top of your class.  

A good rule of thumb: don't go to a school where you're not comfortable with the idea of being median. 




 Confirmed: I am not good enough at words to write sports articles either.  




 Wait, what am I missing?

 I've decided to start dedicating serious time to learning how to program with literally no background knowledge of any kind coming in save for some introductory research I've done. I'm a blank slate, and I'm especially interested in website development.

My two questions are:   
1. Starting from absolute scratch, what all do I need to learn to get to the point where I can be good enough to be comfortable designing websites for other people e.g. HTML, JavaScript? (that's not my main goal, but I think this is a good litmus test for proficiency).  
2. In what order should I be learning them? 




 Also, lol at Nowitzki and Dwight being 'might'. 




 Just out of curiosity- would you consider Yaeger a good review course? 




 Links to brands? 




 GA 




 Not for my state, there's only a flat accounting and business credit hour requirement. I'm in law school and have taken a lot of tax classes which count for the accounting credit requirement, I have four FAR classes from undergrad, so I feel comfortable with those, but auditing slipped through the cracks. 




 I'm doing a non-traditional route to the CPA exam, being a finance major instead of accounting. I meet the education requirements to take the test, but I've never taken an auditing class before. 

Is the auditing section learnable to pass with a good review/prep materials alone? Will it be *significantly* more difficult? Would you advise any sort of supplementary material to get a more grounded education first?

Thanks for your help in advance. 




 I actually love and would buy that hoodie with the classic paintings on it. Any idea where it's sold? 




 Thing here same to say exactly the came. 




 And Rashard was great for the 07-08/08-09 season. 




 If by "liberal arts hipster" you mean "anyone who has never learned how confidence intervals in statistical hypothesis tests work," then yeah. And no, he's not right, even in a technical sense. 




 "How often?"

"Everyone" 




 As much as we need a new backcourt, I'd much rather have Noel's defense to compensate for Vuc and Nicholson who are both lacking in that area. 

I also think I'm in the minority for not loving Smart. 




 7.5pts 5.6rbs in 25mpg in February- probably on par with what the Cavs thought he could do as a rookie. I wouldn't be disappointed.  




 Yep. The most exciting thing to me is that Mo has shown that he has the athleticism and the mind to be *very* good on defense. He can eat up space like crazy and will be a menace on the perimeter in the next 2-3 years. Right now the Magic are playing terribly on defense; Nicholson is doing okay by rookie standards (still lost at times, but as he learns the game better he should get to 'respectable' territory), however Vuc is concerning - outside of his rebound-hawking abilities he's in the bottom tier of the league in defending post moves and contesting shots at the rim. But even with that in mind, both of them have shown very polished offensive games for young players, and our 3+ year future looks bright. 




 There really isn't another reasonable answer to this question. 




 I don't actually know, but if I had to guess, it'd be because if Harden won MVP it would be on land and not on water :P 




 There is no chance on God's green earth Harden wins MVP this year. 




 Lame. Do you know why? 




 Nope. Fiduciary relationships are strictly between the management and the corporation. 




 What do you think would be the best deals for the Magic? Post your hypotheticals here.

 after fiddling around for a little bit, I came up with this: 

http://espn.go.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=b3obtzr  
And not included- Minnesota would give us their first round pick.

Minnesota isn't in a rebuilding phase- so I think they'd be okay letting go of Ridnour, now that Rubio is back and they still have Shved and JJB; and Derrick Williams who is not thriving in their system but could still develop into a pretty solid player. This would be a looking-to-next-season move for them with a healthy Love/Pek/Smith trio making a killer frontcourt for Rubio to dish to.

The Hawks are largely looking to get rid of Smith somehow. JJ fills an immediate need created by the season ending injury of Lou Williams, and they would have the ability to pick which one they wanted during the summer- either letting JJ go for the cap space they crave to sign a maxFA, or resigning him and trading away Lou; and would also get a backcourt player with a ton of upside for much cheaper, and an expiring contract in McRoberts to free up cap space.

Most importantly- for us: we would get a quality guard to make up playing time; partially over the awful Ish, and partially for the hole in our rotation JJ leaves; the rest of would be filled in by Korver who gives us the outside shooting JJ had for us. Korver and Aflallo would compliment each other well as wings, and McRoberts was in the dog house anyways so losing him is not a big deal. Our team would only be slightly worse off as a result of this trade, which is okay considering our focus is on draft position at this point anyways.  
Most attractively- we would get Minnesota's draft pick. Currently they're 8th in the lottery, which is high enough to make losing JJ really worth it. Granted, they do currently owe their 1st round draft pick to Phoenix, but it's top-13 protected, and they would have to pass where Portland is right now (3.5 games behind), so assuming we traded for the remainder of those draft rights it'd be a safe bet we get it.  
We'd have patched together a replacement lineup without JJ so as not to be *completely* awful in the backcourt; and we'd have our top-10 pick we were looking to get for him.  




 Nah, they were acting without an apparent conflict of interest; so the burden of proof to even make it past summary judgment is incredibly high. The elements are a pretty complex. See-

http://www.pli.edu/product_files/booksamples/595_sample7.pdf
 




  his has to be fucking illegal

You'd have to know a *LOT* more of the facts than what we have - but this sounds like could possibly be a breach of fiduciary duty (duty of loyalty, duty of care, bad faith etc.); in which case the minority owners could bring a derivative suit, or the new owners could sue under a direct suit.

/lawschool 




 What's hilarious how ridiculously everyone is over-reacting too. Is he a mentally weak partial-headcase who whines and needs a confident coach to keep in check? Sure.  
Will he, if he has a good year next year by his standards, be one of the three-to-five most valuable players in league, and capable of being the 2nd best or co-best player on a championship team? Absolutely.  
People seem to remember recently how much of a pain he's been on the Lakers, but forget that he was an MVP runner up two years ago with a serious argument to win it; or how he led a team to the finals over the 66 win Cavs with Hedo Turkoglu and Rashard Lewis as options 2a and 2b, and Rafer Alston running the offense. Fans who say they're honestly not interested in signing him are downright crazy. 




 Fab Melo will be the steal of the draft  
Whoever drafts MKG will make the playoffs in the 2012-2013 season  
Austin Rivers will make 6th man of the year at least once in his career  
Jared Sullinger will fail as a pro  
Jeremy Lamb will have the best NBA career  
Charlotte will draft Andre Drummond  
Barnes will win ROY  
Anthony Davis will need time to develop

Those were some of the most shockingly bad predictions I've ever seen. 




 Let's go improving our lottery odds!! 




 Yeah! 




 Yep; looking at their professional careers (i.e. not Maravich's college stats) Wade has already had both a longer career (in terms of total number of games), a higher peak (2006 finals; 2009 in general), and overall statistical superiority in a time where stats aren't nearly as easy to come by (Maravich played half his career pre-merger, and in an era where you were getting an extra 15-20 plays a game).

It's no contest IMO. 




 Eh, I like the spirit of the idea, but I think a Volcker Rule with more teeth and fewer exceptions would be more on point to begin with the modern banking market; considering Glass-Steagall, even when it wasn't repealed, was being whittled down to a formality by complex bank structures up into the 90's.  




 I like the way you think. 




 Damn. Good point. Then replace Georgia with "some other SEC team". 




 Jameis Winston, our stud rookie QB in the wings, throws up RGIII type numbers. We return just about our entire WR, and OL, and 2/3rds of our rock-solid running game. Losing James Coley at OC wasn't a big deal because Jimbo ran the offense anyways. Collectively we break the offensive records we were setting last year, and have one of the best offenses the nation.

Defensively: despite losing three DE's and a CB who will go in the first 2 rounds of the draft, our crazy depth shines. Young guns Mario Edwards, Goldman, Jernigan, and Newberry rise up- we maintain one of the best defensive lines in the nation; and we already return all of our elite-level secondary from last year except Xavier Rhodes- whose spot sensational freshman Ronald Darby fills seamlessly. Despite losing our defensive coordinator and all-around mastermind Mark Stoops to Kentucky, Jeremy Pruitt brings the Alabama grit with him and our defense remains one of the best in the nation.

With one of the three or four best defenses in the nation, and one of the top offenses in the nation we have the talent to contend for a national title - and our coach Jimbo overcomes the coaching hump he hasn't been able to get over before - where we actually win all the games we're supposed to win. 

After an 8-0 start capped off by a road win at Clemson, who was at that point undefeated and ranked 6th, we are vaulted to top-3 in the rankings. Heading into the final game of the season an undefeated FSU embarrasses #2 ranked (and undefeated) Florida to make the perfect regular season. Then it's just a matter of crushing a respectable 9-3 VT team in the ACC championship and we're off to the national championship.

In the NC game, we upset #1 ranked Georgia and get our ultimate revenge on Mark Richt for screwing us in the 2000 NCG and claim our re-emergent ascendancy to being one of the elite programs in college football for years to come. 




 What emulator do you have for a PS2? I've looked and haven't found any good ones. 




 Also, Lillard is currently one of the worst defensive players in the league, and Billups in his prime was one of the best perimeter defenders at PG in the league. That's something you really can't ignore when comparing the two.  




 Orlando Magic in 2008 = no one ever? 




 Let's not forget what league we're talking about. 




 Fuck the Bobcats!


*the rivalry lives on* 




 Well we'd have to trade him this year because he's going to be a FA when the season ends and he simply signs with another team. If you meant trade him this year for a lottery pick next year... IIRC there are rules against trading unprotected first rounders for future years, but I could be wrong about that. 




 They're public, but I've never considered them a 'state university'.  




 Yep; I'm 6'2 150. I'm also a distance runner, so it's unlikely to change, no matter how much I eat (and I do eat- a LOT). 




 Yep.

Based on what Nicholson has done as a rookie, and what Vuc is doing now as a sophomore, I'm quite happy with them being the frontcourt of our future provided they both get better defensively. Vuc needs to get smarter about where to be to clog the paint, put on some more weight so he can bang better down low, and get better at defending against bigs in the post; Nicholson just makes a ton of rookie mistakes- which makes sense because he's a rookie).   
They're both playing well beyond their age offensively, and they could very well be 3 years away from being the best defensive rebound hawking duo in the league.

Mo Harkless is scared out of his mind to shoot, and is bad about deferring to other players. The bright side is that he's showing some very solid flashes of defensive prowess, he can straight up cover space and make things difficult on the perimeter. Best case scenario I could see him have Iguodala-level defense as a SF. He's also the fourth youngest player in the NBA, and he missed all of summer league and the preseason injured, so he might be the least-experienced player in the NBA right now. I don't know if he'll develop into a long-term starter, but I'd like to see him get a year or two before we make a decision. Adding to that- I really don't see Shabazz being worth a top-3 pick. Maybe if Turk was still our starting SF it would be worth the risk- but I'd rather not use the pick here with Mo's potential already waiting on the depth chart.

For those reasons, I think our biggest need is going to be a guard. I don't think there's a point guard worth drafting with our pick, which is likely to be top-3. I'm really low on Smart, he has a lot of intangibles that people love, but shoot-first point guards who can't shoot very well scare me. Too much bust potential there.

We *could* go for another big, and try and develop a killer rotation. Noel would bring some great (much needed) defense in the paint, but unless we luck into the top pick (or possibly the second) we probably won't have a chance to get him. Anthony Bennett could be great- but the fact that he's even smaller than Nicholson scares me, and their skillset seems superfluous.

McLemore is not only the best choice here by deduction of what we need the most, but he's probably right with (or slightly above) Noel for 'most star potential' of any player this draft. And what we really need from this draft is a star. I think we're going to trade JJ before the deadline, and DeQuan Jones is *not* a long term solution at SG. 

My pie-in-the-sky dream scenario looks something like this: we trade JJ and somehow get a top-10 pick out of it. We then draft McLemore and Michael Carter-Williams... Fast forward four years... Vuc, who is already one of the best rebounders in the league, gets his defensive act together, and comes close to replacing the Dwight-shaped-hole in our team. Nicholson has the skillset to be a middle-class man's Lamarcus Aldridge, or heck, he might just be the next Lamarcus Aldridge. Mo *could* become a better-rebounding-worse-passing Iguodala, though right now this is the biggest leap of player development faith I'm making. McLemore could seriously be the next Ray Allen; and becomes our de facto high-end-elite-team-leader that you need to win a championship. Michael Carter-Williams is a true pass-first point guard (which is great because he'll be playing with 3.5 very offensively talented other starters as previously mentioned), and has the size and athleticism to be a menace on both ends of the floor; think Jose Calderon meets Rajon Rondo.

If our five starters are elite - elite - very good - very good - pretty good; then we have a team with a bona fide shot at a championship again. Remember, we made the finals against a 66 win Lebron team with Rashard Lewis, Hedo Turkoglu, Courtney Lee, and Rafer Alston as 4/5's of our starting lineup.

Odds of this happening? Astronomically small. But a fan can dream. 




 You must have missed the "/skip" at the end of my post. 




 Lebron James:  
1. Isn't in the top-3 in the NBA in any major statistical category  
2. Is averaging his 2nd lowest FTA season of his career, and second lowest FT% of his career  
3. 2nd lowest apg since 2007  
4. Only .3 more than his lowest ppg since his rookie season  
5. Shooting a measly 42.1%*  
6. career low FGA

Clearly the dude is falling off the bandwagon. /skip

*only includes 3pt attempts 




 Ha, I was also an FSU grad, so I try to remember the worst in Gators. 

Also- depending on how we define the south- UVA, and UNC are all much better state schools. 




 Vandy or Duke I'm guessing... although I've met UF grads who like to refer to themselves that way. Don't ask me why. 




 2018, I can feel it coming. 




 Number of players to average 20ppg for a season:  
00-01: 27  
01-02: 26  
03-04: 22  
04-05: 26  
05-06: 28  
06-07: 26  
07-08: 31  
08-09: 27  
09-10: 19  
10-11: 21  
11-12: 15  
12-13: 11 at this point in the season, and that number *could* be below 10 before the season ends. 

Do you think this is just a statistical anomaly?  




 On the flipside though- we overpaid Rashard by having Otis Smith (being the GM he was) bid against himself, and he was averaging 22.4/6.6 when we signed him. VC was averaging 20/5/5 when we signed him. The fact that both those guys regressed terribly while on our team is more a reflection of bad luck than it is our inability to grab tier-1 FA's. 

I think you're underestimating our ability to sign non-mvp-contending all-star FA's and here's why: good players will gravitate towards winning championships more than anything else. e.g. Brooklyn may be more tantalizing than Orlando to D-Will, no question, but it's not nearly as tantalizing as the opportunity to be the floor general for a championship team.  




 We're definitely not going to lure Kevin Durant anytime soon- but remember, in the last couple of years we've managed to grab Rashard Lewis, Vince Carter, and even before that Tracy McGrady and Grant Hill. Those were all big names coming to Orlando. I think if we can get to a 50-52 win season with a group of young guys, we could lure someone in the caliber of Deron Williams i.e. someone good enough to be 2nd fiddle on a championship team. 




 I agree that patience is definitely a virtue now, which is why I don't think we should be signing anyone to a max contract until 2016. Just like in 2004-2006 we drafted Dwight, Jameer, JJ, and Fran (lol) first, and let them develop before we went for Turk and Lewis. I think that cycle of drafting good talent, letting them develop, and then once they're good enough that we're not going to be seriously building from the draft anymore- start signing the rest of the pieces we need through FA to get us up into championship territory. 

I honestly don't love afflalo, and I'd be okay if we traded him at some point. I think between the three guys I mentioned above can be 3 pieces of a championship team. If we can draft three more in the next two years (here's hoping to get a good draft pick for JJ), and then sign two more down the road (an x-factor to get us into contender territory, like Rashard was) then we can have everything in place for a championship window 2018-2020. 




 Excluding the first episode. What episode do you think is at its wittiest, delivering the impeccable and hilarious humor that makes the show so great? 




 Like any other team, the Magic have one goal right now- to build a championship team. I can see us being able to attract a high-end player through FA, but despite the Devose ownership groups deep pockets were never going to be the Lakers; and like most teams were going to need to have a best-case-scenario play out i.e. nailing our next two drafts and having the guys on our team really develop well. But first, an inventory: we thought we were going to be barren this year, and while are pretty bad, we have a lot more hope than I think anyone thought going into this season. I have barely seen Kyle OQuinn play, and I dont think Etwaun Moore is going to become anything special, so Ill focus on the three players I think we can best build around.

Vucevic has been a revelation, since January when he started getting used to his minutes and role with the team- hes averaged 14.4 points, 13 rebounds, and 1.3 blocks in 33mpg and 52.4%fg. All this, and hes only 22 and a sophomore in the league. Right now hes a little light, and plays like it on defense  he doesnt have the spatial awareness or lateral speed yet to be a real paint clogger like Marc Gasol or Dwight, and hes not spectacular at defending post-up bigs yet. But hes got plenty of time to learn and get more comfortable with Vaughns defensive schemes. 

Then we have Andrew Nicholson. His minutes have been frustratingly prohibited so far this year- but in what time hes had he has been phenomenal. He has a very mature finish around the rim, and doesnt look nearly as lost as most rookies on defense. Hes 23 already- but in the next couple of years I see him becoming a Lamarcus Aldridge light. 

The player we know the least about of these three is Moe Harkless. Unlike Vuc and Nicholson, hes already shown some great flashes of being a great defender. Hes only a rookie, but he has a lot of intelligence about help defense; and I think as he gets older (hes only 19) he can become a lock-down perimeter defender and a great rebounder. On the other hand- his jumpshot is pretty bad (and his TS% of .500 is showing it). He looks like he can become Andre Iguodala but with worse passing and better rebounding. 

The takeaway? I think these three guys can be the 3rd, 4th, and 5th best players on a championship team in 4 to 5 years when they start hitting their prime. But we still need a high end elite player who can be one of the 10 best players in the league, and someone who can lead us to a championship. We also probably need one more elite player and two more good role-players to come off the bench and give us depth. The roleplayers Im not worried about- we can sign them, or hopefully use our 2014-and-beyond draft picks to develop them (especially 2014, when I think well have a pick in the 10-13 range). 

Getting those two pieces is, obviously, going to be the hardest part of putting a 2017/2018 championship team together. Jameer is great, I love him, but hes going to be 35 by then. JJ I dont expect to survive this season with the Magic. So with our likely top-3 pick in this years draft were going to want to get a backcourt player, and were going to need that player to become elite. I think the person should be McLemore. I dont see Muhammad becoming more than just a good scorer. I f we happen to land the #1 overall- I *could* see us going after Noel and having a killer frontcourt rotation with Nicholson coming off the bench. But I think McLemore has the potential to be Ray Allen, or possibly better. Then its just a matter of luring in one great free agent (Rondo 2016?) Getting our team to fit together, and letting them develop until theyre ready to make a run at the championship.
This is probably all oversimplified, and just one possible route that could happen. What do you guys think, generally, about where this team can go from here? What do you think our ideal future should look like?

 And it wasn't really a great one either. Kindof a fluff piece.

 I'm *kinda* happy about this. It's always a shame to see a player go down, and I didn't dislike Davis at all despite his poor shot selection and undewhelming defense - but It's been infuriating seeing Nicholson get so little playing time, and I'm really hoping this forces Vaughn to integrate him  more. I also would really like to see us get into the top-3 in the draft for one of McLemore or Muhammed, so the tanking aspect of this injury could be nice.

I've found that I like certain aspects of the full look; things I can take away and mix/match with my own style, in which case both the cheap and the expensive listings can both be helpful depending on how specific a thing I'm looking for.

 We're in the exact same asset-collecting stage as you, we don't want to give those up, and we're very high on Elfrid as our starting PG. 




 That's a little bit nuts. Bill Russell was unequivocally the greatest defender in NBA history, has 5 times as many MVP's as Hakeem, and was the undisputed best player on TEN championship teams (I would argue Havliceck was the best player during their '68 and '69 title runs). 




 Sure.  

For Moses - he has a couple factors working for him. He had incredible longevity in his career, he was an all-time great scoring center, and beyond that he was one of the greatest rebounders ever, and beyond that he was THE greatest offensive rebounding center ever; he led the NBA in offensive rebounding 8 times and had a 7 year stretch where he averaged over 6 offensive rebounds a game. I won't get into the statistics of it, but that level of offensive rebounding created an extraodinary offensive advantage for his teams purely by increasing their # of possessions. Very few players in NBA history have ever offered this kind of advantage.  
Secondly, he was the undisputed best player in the NBA from 1978-1983, unseating a late-prime Kareem, besting future teammate Dr. J, and preceding and delaying the Magic/Bird Rivalry as the best players in the NBA. It should be noted that during this time he won 3 MVP's, whereas Kobe only ever won 1 - and it's fair to point out that Kobe's era of MVP competition was much weaker than Malone's. This is probably one of Kobe's biggest knocks as well.   
Finally, Malone was the indisputable leader of the one team that managed to win a championship RIGHT in the middle of the Lakers/Celtics dynasty era of the 80's. He did so by SWEEPING the showtime lakers with Dr. J already in hard decline (he averaged 18/7/3 on 45% in the playoffs that year). I think MM has a very strong argument over Kobe.  

Second, Jerry West - West had the misfortune of playing for the Lakers in his prime against the greatest team dynasty ever assembled. Simply being on a team that MADE it to the finals 10 times in 13 years is an incredible accomplishment. Knowing he didn't ever win an MVP either makes this position a little dubious, but then knowing he was the MVP runner up 5 times makes it a little less dubious, considering his prime coincided with the Wilt/Russell/Oscar primes. West is also the NBA logo - which I deserves a couple points in my book for the sheer iconography :). Some actual numberical arguments for west: he leads kobe in career PPG, RPG, APG, and FG%. Obviously those comparisons don't hold a lot of water when adjusting for the pace of 60's games; but I'll offer two statistical counter-arguments. First, Wests game was severely hurt by the nonexistence of the three point line because West was an *incredible* shooter; in fact just looking at his FG% in the context of his era (FG% was pathetically low in the 60's) alongside arguments that we've all heard in critique of Kobe - I would say there's an argument to be made that West was a better shooter than Kobe was given the evolution of the game in their comparative careers. Second, west consistently averaged many more assists than Kobe in an era where assists were significantly harder to get credit for, which offsets to a good degree the increased # of possessions per game in the 60's.

I'll say finally that I think Kobe's career has been greatly greatly enhanced by factors outside of how good he was as a player. He was always going to be good enough to be the best player on a championship team, sure. But pairing up with prime Shaq and then having Pau-Odom-Bynum as your supporting cast when the East sent relatively weak teams both years, all while having the greatest coach in NBA history coaching your team, were strokes of absolutely incredible luck for him. He did lead his team to two championships, and he is a historically good shooter, and for that I think he definitely deserves a spot in the "God Tier" of NBA players along with about 15 other guys, but I think when you look at how truly good of a player he is I don't see him stacking up favorably purely from the circumstances of his career. When people talk about his drive and will to succeed and be the best, I think it's a great narrative and absolutely true - but ruthless competitiveness is a means and not an end. When we measure players we measure how good they were, not how they got there, so I'm not convinced that's a valid argument to move him up the pantheon.  




 I think the "potential" factor is pretty warranted though. He not have any attitude/mentality issues like cousins, or potentially limiting weaknesses he isn't already rapidly addressing like Kyrie *despite* being on a bad team.

Edit: I'll happily defend any one of those players over Kobe. 




 Furthermore, the Magic pick must convey by 2019 and is set for 2 years after their pick is conveyed to Philly - meaning that the Lakers would have to finish in the top-5 in the next three consecutive lotteries for the Magic pick to become two consecutive 2nd rounders.

It absolutely will convey.

 Heh, according to [this](http://www.runnersworld.com/weight-loss/how-many-calories-are-you-really-burning?page=single); I'm wrong about the calories issue.

But regardless, you *really* should cover less total distance and start actually running. 




 1) calories burned  is roughly equal to distance covered; there is a difference between running and walking but it's negligible. at 5 miles a day you're probably burning closer to 600 or 700 calories.

2) The only real and significant way to improve your ability to run is to run. I can promise you right now that if you ran an aggregate of 10-15 minutes, 4 times a week, you will not come even close to tiring yourself out. You are worlds away from overtraining my friend. Injuries *can* happen, but that's always going to be a risk, so don't fret it.

3) If your goal is to eventually run a 5k, you should stop covering so much distance every day, and start running. Developing your cardio and slow-twitch fiber muscles are your two most important objectives, and neither are going to helped much by walking.

4) If you have a side goal of losing weight, you should do it in the kitchen.

 And Patrick Ewing 




 But to be more fair, he also averaged 48 minutes a game and 40fga per game that season, in an era where teams took on average 30-50% more fga per game than they do today. 




 It's weird to think that if brandon jennings was 2 months younger or had scored one more point he would be on this list. 




  but even then, he's above and beyond those two guys.

Stockton was all-nba first team twice, Nash was the league MVP twice.  
I think there's an argument for both of them, but to suggest it's not even that close is ridiculous. 




 Where did your double-doubles stat come from? [This](http://www.examiner.com/article/players-with-the-most-double-doubles-nba-history) says otherwise. 




 Roy Hibbert has never-

* Had a full NBA month where he averaged over 10 rebounds a game
* Scored 13ppg over the course of a season
* shot 50% over the course of a season
* Been much better at scoring than league average from really any area of the floor, per his [hoopdata](http://www.hoopdata.com/player.aspx?name=Roy%20Hibbert) 

And he's 26, only a year younger than Dwight Howard. I realize that last year he was playing injured for the first half of the season, but until he has at least a full season under his belt of seriously improved play, I think the aforementioned points cast some strong doubts about his potential to be the best big man in the league. 




 How about this then: Roy Hibbert has never played a full regular season month of NBA basketball in which he averaged 10 rebounds a game. 




 Tyson's Corner, you sweet mischievous devil. 




 I'm glad you put a ton of effort into this post, it's refreshing to see an opinion backed by supporting arguments but... I still completely disagree, If we're comparing pre-back injury Dwight to Marc Gasol, then Dwight is still easily the better center.  
    
You acknowledged that Dwight was significantly better at rebounding, but you seem to disregard to some degree just how much that matters for how good they are as overall players. Look, for instance, at [this graph](http://skepticalsports.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Top1000_11343_image001.png) showing how Dwight compares to some of the all time rebounding greats. Being such a tremendous vacuum for defensive rebounding is an *incredible* advantage that Dwight offers that Marc doesn't even meet league-par for (Marc Gasol was 84th last year in defensive rebounding rate, with Zach Randolph 20th).

Even outside of rebounding, I think your on/off the court defensive rating is specious because you're comparing two completely different teams with completely different rotations. Nobody since prime Ben Wallace (who was on par or ahead of Magic-Dwight) has even come close to being the shot-altering, game-plan changing, one-man wrecking crew Dwight was from 2009 to 2012.

On offense- I think you're spot on about Marc's versatility being an advantage, but I think your "floor spacing is everything" argument doesn't hold water. The Rockets are in theory (as the Magic were in practice) aren't going to be held back in any regard by having only one true big on the floor, their emphasis on three point shooting comports with that limitation perfectly.  
Finally, unless I missed it, you completely omitted the impact Howard had as the head-and-shoulders-above-the-league best pick-and-roll center in the NBA offensively. Howard's athleticism on getting to the basket was the single biggest reason (among many others) the magic had the 2nd best offensive efficiency in the league in 2010. 




 Because that's 5 extra years of schooling and anywhere from 200k-450k of student loans. 




 Really, he's just mad we're not catering to 1946. 




 TBD about MKG; he isn't 20 yet, so it's not fair to entirely judge, but he hasn't shown anything between last season and summer league that he was supposed to have coming into the league.  




 AbeeEEeeEEeeeEEEeeed 




 Nah, Walton's prime was comparable to maybe any center in league history, including shaq's; it was just so absurdly short and he didn't use it to win a ring - and so it's been forgotten with time.   




 In re. point 3: Let's not forget that taxing the entire value of the transaction as opposed to the recognizable income on the transaction is almost an offensively stupid idea to anyone who understands how our tax code works (i.e. not r/politics) and would never make it into actual law; though even if it did it would get quickly struck down.  




 .5% 




 To be fair, Jameer didn't help them get to the finals. He was injured. Dwight did work with a backcourt of Courtney Lee (as a rookie), a much lesser developed JJ Redick, and Rafer Alston.  




 Right now I have it at:  
1. Thunder  
2. Rockets  
3. Clippers  
4. Spurs  
5. Warriors  
6. Nuggets  
7. Grizzlies  
8. T-Wolves/Pelicans (total crapshoot depending on injuries and fit) 




 Anyone 6'6 or higher is going to give him trouble, but there are plenty of SG's in the league of comparable height that he can (and usually does) defend just fine. 




 What the fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu 




 SVG said that Dwight was the mot coachable player he's ever coached, and if he had the chance he would do it again in a heartbeat.  




 Yep. Nash winning in '05 was one of the greatest travesties in NBA MVP history. *Anyone* who would argue he deserved it over the four great bigs (Shaq, Duncan, Nowitzki, Garnett) of 05 is insane. 

 




 A  C  F 




 A team in a garbage position is not the same thing as a garbage team. 




 To be fair- that was largely a product of his low usage rate. He was drafted into a team with four good scoring options in place already, and was asked to play a limited role.  




 false. 




 Jrue Holiday, Anthony Davis, Eric Gordon, and Ryan Anderson give them four *solid* scoring options. With Vasquez' passing ability off the bench, they're a good role player signing or two away from being a ~45 win fringe WC playoff team. 

If they don't trade any of the aforementioned 5 for the next two years they're all on contract, all of their players are in their young-to-mid 20's and will likely keep developing from here. I could see them getting up around 50 wins in 2014/2015 with the nucleus they have now. 




 Yeah! Tobias Harris averaged17/8.5/1.5blk at 20 years old, and Vucevic went 13/12 in his 2nd year in the league. Throw in Moe Harkless who is a very solid perimeter defender in the making, Nicholson with a polished offensive game, and Oladipo in the mix; we have a pretty sweet core going forward. 




 Block party in New Orleans.

Love it. 




 Anthony Davis was pretty solid offensively this past year. 




 I like Nicholson :(

But yeah, I totally agree. 




 Also- we're a bit crowded as well. Nicholson had a very nice rookie year at PF; and Tobias Harris will also probably spend most of the time there with Moe Harkless looking like a staple of our future core. We really don't have the minutes to spare unless we want to take them from Nicholson, which IMO would be a terrible idea considering how offensively refined he is already.  




 Yes.  

Oh... fans?  

No.  









 Also:  
Kemba Walker  
Ty Lawson  
Tyreke Evans (if that's really his position)  
Jrue Holiday  
Eric Bledsoe  
Damian Lillard  
Brandon Jennings  
Ricky Rubio  
Steve Nash  
Goran Dragic  
Jarett Jack  
and Greivis Vasquez

Chalmers is really nowhere close to the top-10.
 




 Meh, they also signed Carlos Boozer who, despite underperforming, still made them much better.   
They also signed Thibs as their coach in place of Vinny Del Negro- which meant going from having the worst coach in the league to one of the three best.  
They also signed Kyle Korver, and got Taj Gibson- both were integral role players to the team's success in 2011.

So it's not nearly as simple as you're making it out to be.  




 Okay 




 That doesn't make any sense. 




 OLIDAPOOOOOOOO 




 This is great! I have a solid understanding of reformed theology, heidegger, and Calvin; but not so much modern theology or Schleiermacher, but I will definitely look into those subjects as I plan my attack for this treatise. 

I mentioned in another post that I'll probably be going through the [study edition](http://www.amazon.com/Church-Dogmatics-Vol-1-1-Sections/dp/0567202909/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8 qid=1371540976 sr=8-2 keywords=karl+barth+church+dogmatics) because I don't think I have the theological (or multi-lingual) background to get a good understanding of this treatise when read straight-on.  




 This insight is wonderful and incredible cool. Thank you for writing it. 




 I haven't read any Barth before. How valuable would you say having read something by him before is, as opposed to diving straight in? And what other work would you recommend? 




 Because the [Study Editions](http://www.amazon.com/Church-Dogmatics-Vol-1-1-Sections/dp/0567202909/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8 qid=1371540976 sr=8-2 keywords=karl+barth+church+dogmatics) offer a much more palatable way of reading through Barth's work. From what I've heard this treatise is dense enough that I'd like to take the path of least resistance to minimize any discouragement.  




 I'm heavily contemplating doing a multi-year read through this work, and am equally excited and daunted by the idea of its length and expense (the study books I'm ordering are about 10,000 pages in length and $1,000 total).

Has anyone here ever worked through all or a part of this work, and would they have any insight or recommendations about it?

I'm not sure what that means.

And, I really appreciate the encouragement. 




 This is my first time learning any programming language ever, so this is a very very beginner question. I'm using a textbook that has told me to do a couple of things I already can't figure in getting started. I'm using windows 8.

I don't know how to change a directory on cmd, or how to make a subdirectory. I have no clue what I am doing and it's already incredibly frustrating.

**Edit**: After having searched around for an hour, I can change the directory using cd C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_21, but then I'm getting access denied when I try and set up a subdirectory.  
I've put in a path in environment variables as C:\jdk1.7.0\bin, but that path is not being recognized by cmd? Somebody please help? 




 Fellow JD here, just graduated. So far from what I can tell, it's been more difficult to find a job simply because law schools largely don't have any connections or contacts with CPA firms.  




 Eh. Dwight was quite clearly the best center in the league for at least a four year stretch, and he spent most of this season recuperating from back surgery. Tim Duncan is a power forward. Roy Hibbert is dominating a team right now that doesn't even use real centers; remember he averaged 11.8/8.3 on 45% shooting this year. Marc can do everything well as a center, which makes him amazingly valuable, but the handful of things Dwight does (or rather, did preceding this season,) he does miles better than Marc Gasol.

Let's not get too carried away with short term memory.

 He actually did an amazing job of containing Dwight when the Hawks beat the Magic two years ago in the first round. He's very good at defensive rotations and in several other ways that don't reflect on the stat sheet.  




 I don't mean to sound rude, but implicit possession is like literally the first thing you learn in an informal logic class. They really, truly, are not different at all. 




 No. Stating something is "ridiculous" is, by nature, a matter of opinion. So the "I think" is implicit when you say "it is ridiculous" because we now know that's what you're thinking. They are the same statement. 




 Those two things are literally exactly the same.  




 I've always loved the intensity of Job 38:

Where were you when I laid the earths foundation?  
    Tell me, if you understand.  
Who marked off its dimensions? Surely you know!  
    Who stretched a measuring line across it?  
On what were its footings set,  
    or who laid its cornerstone  
while the morning stars sang together  
    and all the angels shouted for joy?"

Do any verses draw a deep, solemn inspiration the same way for you? 




 If not for him taking his Rhodes scholarship he probably would have been somewhere 3rd-4th round pick; I think things could have worked for him in either direction but he kinda made his bed by taking that year in Oxford. 

Either way, he's an outstanding individual and I'm only happy for him

e.g. If someone puts a lot of thought into an opinion, we should not be downvoting them regardless of what that opinion is; but if their justifications are so weak and exegetically wrong, and their deductive reasoning so horrifically bad, that it arguably *doesn't* even add to the conversation, could that merit a downvote in spite of the effort put into the post? 




 That's nothing like saying the Bulls are just as good without derrick rose; look at their respective records when the pg's are playing and when they're out. 

I've been consistently saying that Rondo is not near the elite point guard everyone in /r/nba thinks he is. The guy definitely has a way of sometimes completely taking over a game... but if he's never going to use it in the regular season, and can only get there 15% of the time in the playoffs, then how much can you really ascribe that characteristic to him as a player? 




 Sorry forgot to mention that this list wasn't exhaustive- it only includes the ~30 highest career points leaders in NBA history. 




 Lebron and Kobe both completed their 8th 2000 point season recently. Durant is the only other player to do so this season, however Melo and Harden might join them before the season ends.   
First of all, I realize that 2000 is an arbitrary number, and this stat isn't too indicative of anything we didn't already know. But it's still interesting to look back and see it as a rough metric for consistency in a player's career: how many times a player averaged 25 points a game for 80 games a season (or a rough equivalent).   That is to say- it could be a rough look at a combination of how long a player was able to score at a high level without injury.   
Of course things like the lockout, game pace, the 3pt line and the evolution of defenses hurt various players through various periods, so I don't think this is dispositive of anything, just an interesting stat to look at. 

Here's an all-time list:

Karl Malone- 12  
MJ- 11 (was 29 when he got his 8th)  
Kareem Abdul jabbar- 9   
Kobe- 8  
Lebron- 8  
Dominique Wilkins- 8  
Alex English- 8  
Wilt- 7 (including a 4000 point season)  
Oscar Robertson- 7    
Dirk- 5  
Allen Iverson- 5 (and a 1989)  
Jerry West- 5  
Larry Bird- 4  
Shaq- 4  
Elvin Hayes- 4  
David Robinson- 4  
Hakeem- 4 (and a 1995 season)  
Moses Malone- 4  
Vince Carter- 3  
Kevin Durant 3  
Patrick Ewing- 2  
John Havlicek- 2  
Tim Duncan- 1  
Reggie Miller- 1  
KG never had one  
Ray Allen never had one  

Edit: I should probably point out that this isn't an exhaustive list of everyone whose ever had one. But everyone who is currently ahead of LBJ in all-time points is included on this list.  




 Honestly, if in 3 months Lebron has a 4th MVP (very likely), another ring (reasonably likely), and another finals MVP (almost guaranteed assuming they win); I'd take his lifetime body of work over Kobe's. 

Those are big ifs though.  




 1. People knock on it all the time. It would be, by far, the lowest fg% of any player in most all-time top-10 lists, with the exception of Bill Russell whose offense makes up 0% of his basketball legacy.  
2. Dwyane Wade, Michael Jordan (emphasis here), Magic Johnson, Jerry West, Oscar Robertson, Julius Erving, Steve Nash, Walt Frazier; and even in the present day Chris Paul, Tony Parker, and Stephen Curry all have much better FG% and TS% than Kobe  
3. Taking into consideration the number of terrible shots he's taken should rightfully work against his legacy, it shouldn't be a factor we control for when defining it. 




 PG: Penny Hardaway  
SG: T-Mac  
SF: Grant Hill  
PF: D12  
C: Shaq  

Not bad for being the 5th-newest franchise in the nba 




 You are awesome. Thanks. 




 Yes, this is it. Thanks! Would you be able to recommend any better analogies? It's a lot easier to communicate conceptually with them. 




 I saw in /r/Christianity a little while back an infographic explaining the trinity. It had a list of good and bad analogies and why they were good and bad. I've spent a while searching through this sub for it but I can't seem to find it anywhere; would anyone happen to know what I'm talking about or have the picture saved somewhere? 




 Dammit, I loved that record.  




 Welcome to /r/nba; where the subscribers are mostly white and the jokes are even whiter 




 Any Magic fan who is okay with us letting go of Vucevic is an idiot. I've also not encountered one among the dozen Magic bros I chat with. 




 No, sorry, I'm a CPA; so generally in an unrelated field.  




 With Thompson, Kyrie, and Waiters- you're one more good draft pick away from having tons of potential; and then one Lebron james signing away from being a real contender. 




 Okay :( 




 No dude, you gotta just understand that PLaSMaN knows your God is imaginary /s 









 You could say the idea of downvoting us is *irresistible*. 
























 Cool. 









 You *really* think Missouri is an Arkansas   Bama/MSU win away from being ranked in the top 4? The team that lost 34-0 to the only currently ranked team they've played this year? 




 As a counterpoint, Florida State is most definitely where they are purely because of their margin of victory. 




 I mean... Muschamp's 3 prior years at UF they've had the #10 (small class), #4, and #2 recruiting class. Being "not a great coach" is still pretty important. 




 Okay :( 




  I also previously predicted that since Minnesota was the first ranked team to lose and not move down a single spot

Utah was ranked 17th in the week 10 poll, lost, and still ranked 17th in the week 11 poll. Minnesota was not first. 




 Ok that's fair. Sorry, my heart rate is basically just set at 140BPM for the rest of the season. 




 If you think for one second the UCLA deserves, or that the committee is going to be in front of FSU, you're nuts. 




 Right now, we could probably use some of their linebackers. 




 Well we had 5 turnovers giving you several short yardage TD's and an offense that couldn't control an alarm clock.  




 Greenbow Alabama was filmed in Savannah, GA. Let the hate continue. 




 Well we'd be the other exception then because we have a better history than Florida. 




 Top 4 anyways. Depending on how you view Osborne, Wilkinson, Hayes, Joe Pa, and Bear. 




 I actually honestly don't. It's extremely hard to go 10-0* against bowl-eligible P5 teams. Especially when 6 of them have a bye or an FCS opponent the week before they play you.

*Depending on if Virginia beats VT next weekend 




 Yep, Florida State has 14, Texas has 9, but USC has never had more than 7, which was during the pete carroll era. 




 yea but 




 No way. If Oregon is the only school in front of you that loses you're still sitting on the outside. 




 Going by the BCS rankings for the BCS era. 




 and #3 vs. #127

EDIT SORRY WRONG POLL:

#1 vs. #127 




 But really though, I counted 5 drops that went straight through the hands of our recievers, including one in the endzone. We were getting murdered by drops, and to suggest that the rain helps with that isn't exactly a far reach. 




 In 2007, Kansas was ranked #2 behind 10-1 LSU. At the time Kansas did not have a single win over a currently ranked opponent. LSU had wins over then ranked #8 Virginia Tech, #12 Florida, and #23 South Carolina.

And for bizarre coincidence: Oregon could easily end up with its best three wins being #8 UCLA, #12 Michigan State, and #23 Utah; with FSU having no wins ranked in the top 20 on tuesday. 




 To be fair, both of those actions constitute a pretty awful job of regrouping. 




 Nah, we stay three this week, then drop to #6 or 7 next week with a loss to UF, then climb back up to #4 with a win over GT. 




 Fans get chaos. FSU gets to play in New Orleans. We all win. 




 It only has one eyebrow. 




 Florida State.

UF Zook's us for our final regular season game, meanwhile GT beats UGA, and Ole Miss wins the eggs bowl knocking Mississippi State out. Baylor loses to KSU, and Ohio State loses to Wisconsin the in the B1G championship game. FSU proceeds to knock out #13 ranked GT in the ACCCG and climbs back up into 4th, with TCU being the 3rd seed. 




 I mean - he probably definitely should have been ejected going by the rulebook. But any given college football game has dozens and dozens of actions where the referee crew varies from the rule book (see: the rulebook definition of holding), so I'm fine with the referee crew deciding that in this case his shove wasn't worthy of an ejection. 




 That ref shoving thread is an absolute bloodbath for nole flairs. 




 I don't think the FSU fans on the sub is that much of a difference. For starters, we have a quarterback that is absolutely hated by the sub (see [comments like this](http://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/2jny8u/post_game_thread_2_fsu_defeats_5_notre_dame_3127/cldgba4),) so right away the people we want to succeed are getting run through the mud by the masses. Additionally, there are a *lot* of people here who think we don't even deserve to be in the playoffs because of the way we played; something FSU fans disagree with. Those two factors working in concert have given rise to a back-and-forth of persecution complex and actual persecution between the FSU fans and everyone else.  

I think at the end of the day you have to decide the value of "quality wins", or how you look doing it, versus the fact that *you are simply winning.* We can all agree that in marshall's case the former clearly outweighs the latter, and in Oregon's case the latter outweighs the former. FSU is a pretty tricky middle ground though, because they've faced a decent but not too difficult overall schedule and have won unconvincingly, but the loss column is still the best in the country. Deciding which one is actually more valuable is a pretty impossible task. 

I side with FSU fans obviously, in thinking that even when we have a down game (or 6) and are dealing with injuries (11 starters missing time so far this season), managing to end up with the win anyways for 11 straight games is still an immensely value trait to have; and it's something no other P5 has been able to do. I definitely don't think we're the best team in the country, but I do think we're the hardest to beat. 

I think writing FSU off as lucky is extremely unfair. Nobody thought Auburn didn't deserve to be in the championship game because of that miraculous touchdown against Georgia, or the kick-6. I don't see why we shouldn't get the same benefit of the doubt. 




 Charles Kelly isn't terrible, but he's no Jeremy Pruitt and definitely no Mark Stoops. 




 Don't worry, we're like 2-0 this year when leading at halftime. 




 That's the Florida State first half we all know and love. 




 I think an important distinction to make is that Purdue hasn't won 5 national championships the last 30 years. 




 Fun fact: no player on an opposing team has had the game high rebounding total outright yet this season. Between Harris and Vuc we're 12-0 with two ties. 




 A little, yeah :/ 




 Congrats on proving that two of the 20 greatest players of all time could only barely carry bad teams to low playoff seeds. This for sure proves Kevin Love isn't one of the 20 greatest players of all time.

Great detective work indeed.

 




 Yep. Florida State actually has fewer overall games because 12 of their wins from 06/07 were vacated. 




 Fun little tidbit: As of this past weekend, there is almost a three-way tie for the most wins of the last 25 years. School records for 1990 to present are:

Nebraska: 238-78-1  
Florida:   237-77-1  
Florida State: 237-67-1

There are a lot of scenarios that could play out for the title. For instance, the UF/FSU game will probably decide who takes the lead between the two Florida teams. If Florida State makes it to, and wins, the national championship they could win outright; unless Nebraska makes it to, and wins, the the B1G and their bowl game. Nebraska has a tough final two games, and if they lose out Florida could take the lead by upsetting FSU. 




 Are you telling me an OJ Mayo/Dion Waiters backcourt wouldn't make you drool? /s 




 I don't think people quite realize, it's not that Marshall isn't a P5 school, it's that they have possibly the weakest schedule in the *entire* fbs division. Their four best wins would would seriously hurt any school in the top 15 as an OOC schedule. 




 Additionally, in future years if there are 4 1-loss schools with resumes like Oregon/Bama, which is not at all unlikely, it could very well mean leaving an undefeated team out of the playoffs. 




 FSU being ranked #1 would mean playing in NOLA which is way way more advantageous than a Rose Bowl game against Oregon. 




 I mean... maybe. As far as potential quality wins left on the schedule, a win over Ole Miss will probably look better than any of TCU's remaining wins, and whoever OSU ends up playing in the B1G championship game. Considering Miss St already has ground on both of them in the eyes of the committee it'll come down to what value a conference championship actually holds, but if I had to, I would definitely take MSU over both of those teams. 




 If that happened I don't think too many people would disagree that those two teams deserved to be in the final. 




 To be honest, I want Miss St. to beat Ole Miss and pass us... playing in New Orleans as the 4th seed would be way way better for us.

Or, Bama/Oregon losing would work too. 




 I mean, Bobby Bowden went 18 straight years without losing more than 4 games. 




 I don't know what Florida State has to do with a comparison between MSU and TCU. 




 It's hard to believe you guys should jump last week's #1 team in the country who suffered a road loss against this weeks #2 team in the country after you beat Kansas by 4 points. 




 Nope. Missouri will very likely climb back in as an 8-2 team.  the B1G will hold pat with 4. 




 I think it's highly unlikely. Even if one of Miss St./Alabama lose in the regular season and you defeat the other in SECCG, there's still  
- Oregon  
- FSU  
- TCU  
- Baylor  
- Ohio State

You'll probably have more impressive wins than most of them by the end of the year, but you also have two very bad losses. You probably need 2 of them to lose to be in. If both Bama/MSU win out and you defeat Bama, then MSU would still probably go over you guys as well. 




 I mean, we're 2 wins behind the winningest school of the last quarter-century (Nebraska, 238 to 236), and averaged 10.3 wins per season under Jimbo before Jameis came along, it's not exactly like we're a flash-in-the-pan success team. 




 I think us being ahead of TCU, with a much stronger remaining schedule AND a championship game against a presumably ranked team means that there's about 0% chance we fall out of the top 4 by going undefeated. If ASU jumped us it would be at the expense of beating Oregon, and I think there's basically no chance of tOSU or Baylor climbing ahead of us either.

Ironically enough, I would actually love to see Alabama beat Miss St., and Oregon win out, and us take the #4 seed over the #2/3 seed, because we'd fair much better in NOLA 5 hours away from Tally than at the Rose bowl. Or just taking the #1 seed would work too. 




 Yes, this. And for real life implications - if Bama beats MSU, I wouldn't be shocked for FSU to move to #4. If we continue to get close wins against our opponents, whose to say a TCU that dominates their remaining games with 1 loss against an 11-1 Baylor by 3 points doesn't jump them either? 




 Really? Not your quarterback? 




 Prostyle offense? Check  

Elite program looking for next years quarterback? Check

One more way to tell Urban Meyer to suck it? Check 




 A quick review of Alabama's wins against ranked opponents:

1. One overtime win against #20 LSU 




 Florida State hasn't had a losing record, at all, since 1977. 




 Fun facts: assuming we both win tomorrow, the totals since 1990 will be:

Nebraska: 238
UF: 237
FSU: 236

However you've also played 10 more games than we have, if you rank by win % we're 2nd among P5 teams at .771 and you guys are 3rd at .760; behind OSU at .774 




 We had a total of 2 bowl wins in school history before Bobby Bowden took over as head coach. We're currently ranked 113th all-time in total games played.

We are a very young program. 




 The Magic rookies Elfrid Peyton and Aaron Gordon will have 2 of the 4 best rookie seasons. 




 I know I know, I just have a chip on my shoulder as a huge Dipo fan the way Giannis was the rookie who came out of last year with seemingly all the hype. I take sick pleasure in belittling his accomplishments. 




 Fun fact: Aaron Gordon just surpassed Giannis' career high, at 9 months younger and with 77 fewer NBA games. 




 What are the 16 programs? 




 FSU was also the preseason #1 in 1993 when they won it all. Historically we've gone #1, #4, and #1 when ranked #1 in the preseason polls. 




 Kyrie Irving's 2nd career game without an assist.

The 6 total assists by the Cavs this game was a lower than any game by a team these for the past two seasons.

Damn. 




 He was really good at halftme adjustments last year too (see: Auburn), it was just never apparent because our starters were usually out halfway through the third quarter. 




 Honestly I would say he's simply gotten better as a coach during his tenure. We probably had the talent to go 12-2 his first two years as coach, and a team that should have gone 13-1 in 2012 (no way we were beating you guys the way EJ played), but his ridiculous conservativism held us back big time offensively; he's shown some really smart playcalling ability these past two years and he's definitely a huge reason we're 22-0 these past two seasons. 




 No, arguing halftime scores when talking about crushing opponents over a full game is never valid. 




 49-17 final score though. 




 Minnesota's last three games are against Iowa (6-2), Wisconsin, Ohio State, and Nebraska. There's a good chance they finish 7-5 or worse and are not really considered a needle-moving quality OOC win.

I hear you though, I think you guys are the better team for sure and are much more likely to make it, I was just responding to the post above that you guys aren't 100% safe as a Big12 playoff invite even if you win out. 




 I mean if Baylor wins out, they'll have a comparable schedule of good wins (one more better win, against you guys, once worse loss, against WVU), and I would imagine having the conference championship would be the tiebreaker in the committee's eyes. 




 Huh, I was misinformed. Thanks. 




 What did he say? 




 If Baylor wins out (including wins against Oklahoma, Okie St., and Kansas St.) they'll win the conference, and very likely could jump TCU. 




 This is actually incorrect, we vacated the win, but we did not vacate the appearance. So even going technically by ncaa standards we still have 33 consecutive appearances. 




 Definitely you guys; the UF alum network in the state of Florida is way more powerful than FSU's. 




 Standard scoring, need 1 starter:  
Lamar Miller v. SD  
Justin Forsett v. Ptt  
McKinnson v. Wash 




 What conference did you lose to again? 




 If* 




 Don't forget Clemson! 




 In no particular order, I think it will be:

1. Oregon - Survives Stanford, cruises through the final three games, and with a healthier O-line beats whichever Arizona team makes it to the Pac-12 championship game.

2. Kansas State - despite all three remaining tests being on the road, being the one elite big-12 team with very good defense allows them to win out.

3. Notre Dame - I think not falling very far after the loss to FSU benefits this teams greatly, and they make it by winning out. 

4. Georgia - For the SEC West, I'm predicting Auburn to lose to UGA but beat Alabama and Ole Miss; Alabama to beat Miss. State and LSU but lose to Auburn; Ole Miss to lose to both Miss. State and Auburn. That leaves Miss St. (who otherwise wins out) the SECw champion at 11-1 and all other teams with at least 2 losses. I think Georgia will beat Miss St. in the SEC championship game and is the only SEC team to make it because no other SEC team ends the season with only 1 loss. (Yes, I realize predicting that many games is ridiculous)

I think Florida State's shady offensive line and lack of run game will collapse against one of the best defenses in the nation this Thursday, and they lose to Louisville and are out of the playoff picture. I'm also predicting Ohio State to win out and beat Michigan State, but with a weak SoS and a bad loss, they end up being one of the one-loss teams on the outside looking in. 









 Seriously arguing Davis had a better defensive year than any of Dwight's from 2008-2012 using blocks, steals, and fouls as his substantiation is basically the definition of being a box score expert. 




 The thing with Tobias is that he's way more of a wildcard than Vuc. We, for the most part, know Vuc's floor as a player. Tobias varies between looking like a career backup worth $4m a year, and a career 19/8/3 guy worth max or near-max. I honestly don't even know what I would extend him for; 4/40 maybe? I can definitely see why he's going to be a bit more polarizing in extension talks. 




 I actually don't think they would. FSU has no ranked teams left on the schedule, so I don't see them getting a win that will launch them back into it. I expect at least one sec west school to finish with one loss and not win the division; and/or Georgia to be in if they win the SEC. Assuming FSU loses, two spots for SEC schools is a very likely scenario. 

With two spots left, I think Notre Dame, Oregon, Baylor, Kansas State, Michigan State, and *maybe* Ohio State would all pass them if those teams run the table, and I think the odds of 5/6 of them lose another game would be pretty slim. 




 Nope. That article's source is just another person speculating. Still no word as to whether he will or not yet.  




 Don't be a dick. 




 Well there are four teams in the SEC West better than the best team in the Pac 12 South so.... 




 I just mean Bobby v. Tom Osborne, sorry, vague language. 




 All I meant was that there's a very good argument that he's better than Tom Osborne, haha sorry; I don't think he's the greatest football coach ever. 




 I mean, objectively there's a very very good argument that he is. 




 Yep, if you do tax high net wealth individuals you may be 35-40hrs 40 weeks a year, but the month leading up to April 15th, and the two weeks leading up to Sept 15th and Oct 15th it's not unusual to go north of 90. It's very specific to your group (and even firm) within the profession. 




 That's the point of emphasis of his post. 




 It also matters that their two best players are still young and not in their prime yet. 




 Are we just ignoring Oladipo now? 




 Stop. 




 Why does the PAC 12 continuously do this to itself. 




 You realize that's very possible... right? 




 Yes. This is how rankings work. Everybody doesn't get to be in the top-25. 




 Oregon struggled worse than we did against arguably a worse team than we had, so even in spite of their win it's not like they don't have question marks. 




 Basically guarantees he **have** to run the table, but at the same time makes running the table a heck of a lot easier. 




 It's alright. The ACC only needs one ranked team anyways. 




 curious, how do you measure "moisture" as a percentage? 




 Ahhh crap, okay: Justin Forsett, TY Hilton or Terrance West at flex?? 




 In the last 30 years Florida State football is #1 in the nation (outright or tied) in the following categories:  
winning percentage overall  
winning percentage vs major conference teams  
winning percentage vs top 25 teams  
winning percentage vs final top 25 teams  
winning percentage vs final top 10 teams  
wins by double digits  
blowouts (20+ point wins)  
bowl appearances  
bowl victories  
Top 25 finishes  
Top 10 finishes  
Top 5 finishes  
wins vs bowl teams  
wins vs 10-win teams  
wins vs the SEC Champion  
wins vs the (eventual) National Champion  
total wins  
Heisman winners  

Florida State also has, by far the longest streak of top-5 AP finishes (14) and top-4 AP finishes (13). The second longest streak was Pete Carrol's USC at 7 for both.

Extending it out a little bit, Florida state is also reaching the all-time bowl appearance streak, currently at 32, and only behind Nebraska 35 (1969-2003) and Michigan 33 (1975-2007)
