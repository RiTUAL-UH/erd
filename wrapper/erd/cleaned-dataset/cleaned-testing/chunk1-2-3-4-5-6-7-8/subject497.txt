 Thank you. It happened little over a month ago. It took me some time to bring myself to write about it. 

I've told a few people I'm close to. Most seemed sympathetic (or at least didn't verbalized their skepticism).  




 Hi R/Nosleep. I havn't been able to sleep for a while. 

Sometimes I stay up late. I love my wife, so much. So so much. But, sometimes I stay up late. My wife goes to bed, and I stay up. Redditing or playing video games, or watching T.V... 

I'd fallen asleep on the couch as I often do, and I awoke to my wife standing over me, crying, shaking me awake. I asked her what was wrong, but for a while she didn't speak. She just hugged me and sobbed. I stroked her hair and comforted her. 

I wondered if she might have had a dream that I died or something, or if maybe she'd received a text with some tragic news. Finally when she calmed down a little she said "Let's just sit together for a while." 

"Do you want to tell me what happened?" I asked. She seemed to think about it, and decide against it. "No. I just want to spend some time with you, for a little while." 

"I'm tired." I said, stretching. "Let's get in bed." "No!" she almost seemed to shout. "No. I don't want to go in the bedroom right now." I was concerned, but my wife could be a tad eccentric, sometimes even charmingly child like. Maybe going back in there would remind her of a nightmare she'd had?

We wound up sitting on the couch chatting. About anything and everything under the sun (except for what had upset her). We played portal. 

She made coffee, and we snacked on some left overs. We laughed, we reminisced about the early days of our relationship. Before we knew it, it was 7:00am. "I'm too tired, sweetheart, and I'm sure you are too. Let's get some rest so we don't waste our entire Saturday."

"No! We can't! Please!" She cried. "Why!?" I asked "What's the matter?" 

"We just can't go in there. Please. If we go in, it'll be over." She said, her eyes welling up with tears.

"What!? What's in the bedroom?" (I was really confused. Had she accidentally broken some heirloom, and she was afraid I'd be upset with her?) 

There was a long silenced as she fought back sobs. Then finally...

"My body is in there! I'm dead, Prakash. I saw my dead body, lying on the bed. Once you see it, it'll be over." 

This was a bit much. Obviously she'd had some nightmare, that she'd believed was real. 

"Oh, sweetheart, no. No...it was just a bad dream. Everything is ok." I hugged her as she sobbed. "Look, you're just sleep deprived. You'll feel better when you wake up. I promise."

She nodded somberly, then walked silently, with me to the bedroom. I gestured to the empty bed, completely devoid of bodies. 

"See there? It was a dream. Lay here with me." I flopped onto the bed playfully and then propped myself up on my elbow, to chat until we slept. She laid down next to me and closed her eyes. 

"So, what had you dreamt?" I asked. She didn't answer. "Diane?" I asked. "Did you really fall asleep that quickly?" I laughed.  

I shook her, and she was stiff. I noticed her lips were a little blue around the edges. Next I noticed she wasn't breathing. 

Of course I panicked. 

Of course I called 911. 

She was only 27 years old. An aneurysm in her sleep. The coroner said she'd been dead for five or six hours before I "found her body".  

I miss her so so much. I hope my promise is kept - where ever she is now, where ever she woke up, I hope she feels better.

 I saw her walk *through* a glass window, once. Like, just kind of *phased* through the window above my bed, as though it was open. 

I think she can pass through anything light can pass through. If you have wooden shutters, try locking them, or otherwise obscuring points of entry for light.  




 Holy shit. I'd definitely try to stay on Matt's good side, if I were you. 




 That is terrifying, do you have someone else you can stay with for a while? Dogs are a great alarm system and source of protection, please get one!  
























 I am very *very* thankful for that. I was something of a borderline-skeptic before. If I wasn't *so sure* that she still existed in this universe somewhere I think I would be in a much worse state of mind right now. I really needed those last few hours together, and I think she knew that. 
 




 Thank you for your kind words. It's a slight relief to share the weight of it with people who will listen without judgement.  




 Thank you. 

The doctors said she had an aneurysm, and the coroner listed it as "natural causes", which to me, just seems so baffling for someone her age. 

She didn't smoke and she wasn't over weight. She did have just slightly high blood pressure which runs in her family, but she took good care of herself and ate a good diet. 

She hadn't complained of any symptoms leading up to it so I don't know if she felt them or not. 

Since she was asleep when it happened, I personally really don't think she would have felt any pain or anything like that.  




 Please do. I'm happy for you and your wife, it's a comforting reminder that joy and love still exist out there, even if *I* am sort of on pause for a bit. 

Please, forget trivial disagreements, realize the value in every moment and make as many pleasant memories together as you can.  




 Thank you. I know maybe it sounds cliche, but writing about it has been a little therapeutic.  
























 Haha, that's sweet. I'm happy for you guys, treasure each other.  




 Thank you for your kind words.  




 I know it's easier said than done, but enjoying your time together is a million times better than worrying. Diane loved Portal. She would sing the songs from both. The graphics in Portal 2 gave her motion sickness, sometimes, though.   




 Thank you. I used to be cynical about such things but there's no way I could have survived this if Diane hadn't assured me that she's still out there somewhere. She knew that. 

I know she has to be a very pure soul in order to pull something like that off, so wherever she is now, must be a good place. She deserves that more than anyone I've ever met.  




 Thank you, and I do feel very fortunate for our last few hours together. I attribute that entirely to Diane being a very pure soul.  
























 My deepest, sincerest condolences. 

I hope you can see the experience as a gift.

I truly, truly do. I think it was a gift bestowed on Diane, because she's way more deserving of it than me. I'm very thankful for every single moment she spent in my life.  




 Thank you very much.  




 Thank you, sincerely. I feel like sharing it lifts a small portion of the burden off of me. Sometimes I feel guilty that I was given an opportunity that people more deserving than me long for. 

I can only guess that it was either: actually a blessing bestowed on Diane (as she deserved a granted wish more than anyone I know), or that I *needed* an experience like that more than most, due to my own spiritual weakness. 




 Thank you. I think I will. Eventually.  




 Thank you for your kind words. I'm grateful that my experience can be meaningful to others.   
























 At first I did. I really really did. I sobbed for hours just thinking "why did I go in". I spent days on the couch wishing I could see her standing over me. 

But ultimately, I don't think I can regret going in. 

I know that Diane must have been a very pure soul to achieve something like that, almost pure enough to attain Moksha (in Hinduism, it's freedom from rebirth. An extremely perfect state. Its *way* better than rebirth, but it's hard for we who aren't very spiritually advanced yet to grasp). 

I can't help that I wish I could see her again. But I also fear that her attachment to me could hinder her on her journey.

I'm sure that when she departed, she took birth in much better circumstances than in our house, worrying about me. 
 




 Thank you. I'm sorry for your loss, and I also sometimes feel guilty that Diane and I got to, essentially, say goodbye when most people don't. 

I don't think it's a matter of you being unlucky, though. I don't think this was given to me because I deserved it, but maybe because I *needed* it due to my spiritual immaturity and weakness. I do know that Diane deserved a chance to say goodbye though.  




 That's so very sad, I can't even stand to picture my wife in that situation. I wish that coupled had gotten the last moments together Diane and I had. When I first learned learned her death was caused by an aneurysm, it seemed like something that must be incredibly rare. But now when I tell people about it, it feels like everybody knows of someone who's died this way.  




 Really? I wasn't on here back then, can you link to it? I would be interested in reading about similar situations.   




 Thank you.  
























 I just searched through it myself, after reading your comment, and now feel a bit dumb. I remember thinking my tooth-fairy remark was funny as shit at the time (I was slightly drunk). 

It prompted a discussion between me and Diane, because I hadn't grown up with the whole tooth-fairy thing, and wanted to find out if she had believed in it.  




 Thank you, I would say that sharing it with others does reduce the burden. 

I don't want to try astral projection or anything like that, because I want Diane to go on to her next life and experience all the happiness she deserves. To be honest, I pray that she doesn't even remember me. I don't want her attachment to me to hinder her journey.  




 She was decent. She enjoyed solving the tests, but to be honest I think she liked the story lines more. Sometimes she got frustrated and watch walk-throughs. She also liked to watch me play.  




 I used to. But, I know she had to leave eventually. Her attachment to me shouldn't hinder her on her journey, and I want he to know that. I know she must be someplace as beautiful, and amazing as her now.  




 It's not silly at all. Diane and I always kept a white-board on our fridge, where we'd write things we needed to do, and our shopping list. 

Some things (errands we hadn't gotten to yet, and frequently purchased groceries) would just stay on there, cluttering up the board forever. 

The other day I went through the list to erase the things that had already gotten done (mostly things pertaining to Diane's funeral services, and my recent trip to India). 

I don't drink cashew milk, but Diane kept it on the list. I started choking up right after I erased it. 
 
























 Thanks, you too.  




 I keep getting comments like this, but I really don't know how to answer. I mean...can you imagine my own confusion? 




 Yes, we had played it, plus the left-overs and coffee were still out. That's how I know it wasn't a dream, and that I hadn't just woken up in bed and found her. 

I just got back from a three week long trip with my brother where we stayed with my aunt and uncle. I've been surrounded by nothing but friends and family, which definitely helps. 
 




 Thanks yaar.  




 I know I was conscious. The mugs and plates were still out from the coffee and left-overs we had.  
























 Thank you. 




 This is a really touching read. We all derive fulfillment through helping others. We all need to be needed. We're like gears, our interdependence is what gives our lives meaning. 

I found:

It gave me something to focus on besides my grief and turned me into someone my brother would be proud of.

especially inspiring. I'm really glad to hear you're doing better. Remember that those close to you have the same human need to help others, so don't be afraid to reach out to them. Take good care of yourself.  




 That's a sweet proposal story! I guesstimated my wife's ring size by casually letting her mess around with an old ring I normally wore. When she slipped it on, it seemed to fit perfectly, so I figured "If it fits me, it'll fit her" was a good philosophy for engagement ring shopping. 

Then when I bought the ring it was too big for her. Apparently my own ring was slightly tight on me and slightly loose on her. 

It was ok, because it's always easier to resize a too big ring than a too small ring (plus, a girl will feel embarrassed if her finger is too big to fit into the ring). Unfortunately I hadn't purchased the "re-sizing insurance" thing, so it was extra.  

TLDR: Always buy a slightly too big ring, and re-sizing insurance.   




 Thank you.  




 Yes it's my name (I don't normally give personal information, but I figured first names would be ok because I didn't expect many people to see this). I grew up in the U.S., but my parents are Indian. Take care.
