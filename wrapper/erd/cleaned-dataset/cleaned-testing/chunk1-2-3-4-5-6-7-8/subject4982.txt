 That is amazingly wonderful. In highschool I never had a boy friend and going to dances was always a thing us friends did in a huge group!!! GGG 




 This reminded me of my boyfriend, 9 years Army. The love of my life, lost. We will meet once again my love. 




 If you're worried about anything supernatural, I suggest having a couple cameras set up around the room. And watch carefully and thoroughly. 




 Would be mine too. 




 Lol fuck that, normally not one toget into this argument but IPhone is ass and yes, I am using one/own one. Worst phone I've ever owned. Dot cars for apple products in general was given to me. You don't just stop being blind because of apple lol 


P.S- extremelyintoxicated right now will regret this later 




 Congrats! Big step for him. But do not take his showing of no interest personally ever. Although it may be hard to deal with sometimes he will get there eventually. Each child goes at their own pace.


But again congrats! 




 Not an unpopular opinion. As a waitress/smoker and restaurantuer I cannot stand when people bring their children into our restaurant. 




 Beyond handsome. 




 Dope shirt in the bottom picture, how did you stumble into that?  




 I'm a bartender at two restaurants and nothing kills me more than this gluten free fad. I understand some people really cannot have gluten but the ones that can.....

My new response to people that ask what on our menu is gluten free I now tell them 'Sir/ma'am, anything that had a face.' 




 Whack 




 Microwave your spoon and catch your house on fire orrrrrrrr stick the spoon in hot water and not be a dumbass. 




 Because I had the luxury of being able to go on spring break and to play sports, granted I bought my first car and am still driving it to this day, but my parents had money when I was his age. My parents at this point both have jobs but at their age it's so difficult to find something like he had before making that amount of money. I wanted to help, I want my siblings to have a somewhat 'normal' life like I did. That's why I do what I do. It was my choice. I couldn't stand to see my family suffer anymore. 




 Without even trying 




 Amazing! 




 I grew up with those trees all down my street, I always thought they smelled like cod. 




 They typically form from ingrown hairs. 




 WTF SAME! Sylvania!  




 It is a cyst. I'm not an esthetician or anything but have gone numerous times to get those removed, I stopped going because I love popping things so I do it myself. I pierce the skin with a sewing needle after sanitizing it and it has to go through the layer of skin and the sack the cyst is in. It will hurt. Then squeeze. The process is a little painful and if your not grossed out easily I suggest you do it yourself. Sometimes they just explode when you least expect if so I do it myself so it doesn't happen at the wrong time. Hope that helped a little.  




 Fello oHIGHo tokerr, hence my user name. Wish we could blow down, that would make me one happy girl!  




 That's how you should be.  









 LOL 




 Calle Ciega is the name of the band.  




 Yes, I was in Venezuela visiting family and this guy had taken real interest in me. My cousin was freaking out, so excited that this guy was talking to me. Surprisingly he was very fluent in English and that made me really happy. We danced on the beach, had dinner and an amazing time. One thing led to another and we ended up sleeping with each other. The next day my cousin told me who he was. Turns out he was in what we here would call a 'boy band.' South Americas Backstreet Boys. Even though I didn't know it at the time afterwards I felt an odd sense of accomplishment. Like "I just did a celebrity." Never saw him again, but did download his album off iTunes.  





























 Will post my picture soon!  




 Any chance this came from someone in northwest ohio? I swear I saw this on a girls facebook page a few weeks ago.... 




 Melatonin should do the trick, it works for me every time. Good luck- hope you find the remedy right for you. Cheers 




 That's okay then it will be all juicy and fun! I canny wait to see, thanks for sharing.  




 You go girl!  




 Passing my blunt to you. TOKE ON!  




 Ask someone to get it with a bobby pin or a comedone extractor.  




 Dem blackheads.... 




 As an avid cocaine lover I want to lick that off of her then eat her pussy. She's not bad looking at all. 




 Congrats handsome! We all deserve happiness- even if it only lasts a moment. 




 Try  /r/beards !!

But I do love it!  




 Looooool hahahaha LOL  




 Heaven! Simply beautiful. 




 Yessssssssss! 




 When I was younger and played a lot of sports I had horrible acne on my back in the outline of my sports bra. One day I was trying to get rid of some of the acne and came upon this really massive bump under my skin. So I started to squeeze and squeeze, it hurt so bad. I called my mom into the bathroom and told her to get it out. Once it was fully out it was the hardest most odd looking thing just like that! It was the size of your standard pill capsul. I dropped it on the floor and it made a clinking sound. I'm assuming it was a really old blackhead built up from over the years!  




 LOLOLOLOLOLLOL 




 That's appalling. 

Good luck resting in Peace you selfish asshole. 




 Its fake. And call me crazy but it looks like an image of Jesus in that round white thing when you zoom in, but I'm really stoned so that could be it. 




 I could do that! Lol 




 Perfect! I love getting ride of them!  




 I didn't 'force' him to do anything, he asked me to do it and then complained the whole time.  




 He wouldn't let me take an after picture, he was squirming the whole time and threw away the napkin! We didn't get a long hence the ex boyfriend part! Haha 




 I got them out with an extractor. And if you do not have one, the loop part of a bobby-pin works just as well!  









 I wanna get that  




 OHIO! 
























 /r/popping  




 That's happened to me a few times, I have worked at the same Country Club for 6 years. Each time they get closer to me.  




 Wtf did I just read?  




 Left over blow- duh... 




 Hello neighbor!  




 Toledo, Ohio.  




 I want to have really intense, mind blowin sex in there then take pictures of the handprints. 

Is that weird?  




 You. Your man-bun. Your beard. 

Ever close to Ohio, let me know.  




 Your mike has a blackhead. Lol that's what I see atleast 




 If only.... 




 Quite clever  




 Idk that nipple tho.... 




 For this, I would have also. I'm losing my mind. 




 Pull be pregnant in a couple months.  




 Post this to /r/popping and take a look at some of the other Plantar Warts on there!  




 I think it's strangely hot. 




 Hairy bum. 




 Maybe that's why Gary meows in Spongbob 




 Cyst* and share this on /r/popping they would enjoy it.  




 I cannot find it, I dug for it.. 









 Thank you for delivering OP!  




 I've always used a bobby pin or an extractor. It helps to have someone help you with the ones in your ears. SOMEONE WITH A STEADY HAND. You DO NOT want someone to slip and rupture anything inside your ear. 

Happy popping!  




 I would love to see a picture of the bathroom. 

I'm a medium. I have spoken to the deceased for years, starting when I was about 6-7. (21/f) Not only that I'm an active member at our local paranormal group. People have brought me into their homes to try to figure out what was going on. 

You need to research the property, and surrounding areas land. You need to be sure that no one in the home has brought home any new items. 

Please be aware that even though you told this entity to leave does not mean it will not return. (I am not trying to scare you.) 

We like to say that sometimes spirits will go dormant. They do also cycle. Haunt at specific times of the year, things like that.

Please post pictures, I would love to see the dog also. 

Best of luck to you, and remember- we are never alone. We chose to see what we allow ourselves to.  




 I don't think that is harsh at all...any crime against a child is haneous.  




 Let's find these girls and slap them, too many people I know have does from Molly. She is not your friend. 
























 Dabbbbbbbbbed 




 Hell yeah I will! I need a large cover up here soon, will stop in on a day off!  




 Dear brother, 27 years you will never get back. No matter the amount of money you will receive for this it can never make up for the things you wanted and hoped for.  I feel for you and I hurt for you. May you be free to do as you please. 27 years you stared at those gray walls hoping things weren't the way they were. I am honored you are a part of this community again and I hope justice is brought to those who it is bestowed upon. 

Love from Toledo 




 Cheers from Sylvania! 




 Having an alcoholic father and being an alcoholic myself, please do not stop this journey. I found my father for dead after a long day of us both binge drinking (not together) and was so messed up I couldn't save him myself. I hope the best for you and your journey. I wish my father could watch me go through mine.  




 Wait- do you have an extra tooth?  




 Gummo!!!!! Wtffff  




 TaTU 




 Danielle? Doug? Greg?  




 The pimple does not do the mustache any justice... 




 I love you sir.  




 Handsome!  




 A dream of mine.  




 Confradulations Johnathan! You are an amazing being. Keep up the good work and always remember there are people out there you don't even know who admire you!!  




 /r/popping plz we would love this there  




 She had her "Dead girls Don't cry" tattoo then and a few others, smaller breasts, added a lot when she got into the film industry. I'm from Toledo so it was an easy drive.  




 She's one of my favorites. When she used to strip in Dayton friends and I would go see her.  




 The only porn star that has absolutely flawless skin is Bonnie Rotten. Plus she's stunning without makeup which is hard to find these days in the adult film industry.  




 My eyes 




 You poor thing.  




 First off I agree with the people that are saying it's the eyebrows. That's a big part of it. Also, the woman is AGING. We all get older and all age differently. She hasn't been using fillers either...leave the woman alone. We have other issues in the world to worry about other than her appearance. Priorities people.  




 Damn Catholics. 




 You are beautiful! 




 As a graphic design artist you can clearly tell this is photoshopped. Better luck next time!  




 Ypuuuu first set are gorgeous. 




 This melts my heart. 
























 Grrrrr 









 I tried and my pinky muscle instantly was strained! 




 I'm 22 and my ex is 37. We never found it strange. I got along better with him than any guys my age. 




 Now you're forced to wash you hand you sickos... 









 It kinda looks like a foot  




 YAAAAASSSSS! 




 I've always had a crush on 50, now I'm in love with him. 




 Hims kinda cute  




 Lmao it's because your hair is so corse and so much. But PENIS THUMBNAIL LOOK ALIKE 




 Glorious. 




 Thank you for your service!  




 Gotta love Krogers 




 What if you got really drunk one night and ended up going home with him. Drunk like you have long passed blacked out...you wake up in the morning at the not tattooed side of the face is laying on the pillow next to you. He then rolls over..... OUT! DONE! 

Idk why that was the first thing that came to mind when I saw this post. 




 Damnit Ohio- after that big win then you pull something like this!  




 I have done this since I was about 13, I used to go after school with my homework and layout.  




 Face... 




 MISTRESS!! She's smart.. 




 Well I'm sure it's nothing you haven't heard before..sometimes we need a little reminder lol 




 The Gods did us women a favor when they created you!  




 Lol OP I used to work at Nick   Jimmys! Hahaha 




 That is glorious!!  




 Bass..........head 




 Thanks everyone. I know he won't see this, I'm not a complete moron- but I think it's important to always say what you feel. Even if he can read it there are other people out there who can. And who knows, maybe one day he will.  




 Right on! Kills how crooked this world can be. 419 
























 BULLS EYE.  




 Thanks!! 




 Where is this?! I'm off Centennial and see things like this all the time. 




  Meowwwwwww 




 STOP! I LOVE THIS! 




 I work at a 4.5 star restaurant. We feature tons of amazing craft beers and wine on tap. This is one of our featured beers of the month. 









 Every creature can be good  




 I hate this I'm scared  




 Cheese graters  




 This isn't even popping. It's pulling out staples....idk just not my idea if this sub I guess.  




 I met him in Miami a few years back. He was taking shots of tequila 2 days after he left Celebrity Rehab with Dd. drew. Seemed fine at first then he got more and more out of control.  




 For some reason this reminds me of HIMYM when Lily goes to Marshall's for the Holidays. All it is missing is the potato chip crumbles. 




 SQUIRT 




 Lilacs.... 




 Toledo?  




 Youse look like siblings. 




 Well thank you for that bit of knowledge. !! 




 I have one too! My doctor calls it a "sinus cavity". I have one of each ear. You are not alone.  




 Deeeeeerbed 




 It all happened so quickly. He bumped it with a Q-Tip and the whole thing burst right away.  




 Oh Yeahh, you know it!  









 Ohio is like that sometimes.... 




 I know your doppelgnger. 




 My inner thighs get these all the time. Being female and working in a bar I'm constantly walking/power walking and it's mostly heat rash. My doctor told me to always leave them be and just continue to use my Proactive on them cause "it can't hurt". But this one was different it felt hard so I had to squeeze! Really glad I did. 
























 To work my ass off to go back to school and not have to pay student loans.... 




 I remember switching from private to public schools...private schools everyone had brand-new art supplies. Crayons, makers, pencils, pens... This one kid in particular came from a very under privileged family.. I noticed his crayons one day, seeing that they were old and had been used a while ago. I took the money out of my piggy-bank and bought him a new pack. At the age of 7. To this day I will never forget the smile on his face when he found/opened up that new box of crayons that randomly appeared in his desk. 

 




 Something Corporate 




 God Bless the World, this is why I drive a Ford. Such amazing people. Love from Ohio my dear Redditor! 




 I'm from the Midwest, where pop is a soda and ranch is out on everything.  




 Gotta love Frank Zappa 




 Most of us women at the age of 12. If I can recall one girl named Meredith- she had called me a cow and said I was possessed by the devil. So I threw a chalk board eraser at her head. We went to catholic schools. She got a sucker for the pain, I got scolded, detention and 4 wonderful weeks of counseling by our parish sisters.  




 I think I have enjoy the concept of the show. The retired PI and the psychic/medium. Goodness, hopes down. But it's all good!  




 What gets me about her sketches is that when there are creatures or other entities the way she describes them and the sketches totally freak me out. The one that I will never forget, this image has stuck with me for moths was of the creature that she claimed to be an evil spirit in someone's hallway. It was a black mass with a round shaped mouth. It looked like it would suck the life out of you. I've seen something similar before and it just really struck me as real.  




 Does anyone on here watch Dead Files? If so how do you feel about Amy Alan? Being somewhat sensitive myself I feel as if she is the realest.  




 I wanna kick this ladies ass. For real. Being a girl and playing street hockey as a kid not ONE adult complained. They were so happy we were playing streey hockey and not doing drugs like the other. Bitter bitch. She needs to grow the fuck up. If it is that big of a deal talk go the parents not 12,year old kids. Fucking moron.  




 I can see the eye. It blends right in like it belongs in the darkness. When I noticed it I felt a huge weight in my chest. 


I cannot say I am a professional psychic/medium but I do know I have abilities and many "professionals" have shared that same information with me. 

Try saging the house. All corners, door ways, every room including the attic. This can be done at any time, if you are more comfortable with the daylight do it then. Say something to bless the house and be rid of the spirits. Send them on their way to the actual afterlife. Another thing that I do whenever staying somewhere new, hotel, house, whatever- salt. Salt gets rid of negative energy. Windowsills, door ways and EVERY CORNER.  




 Upvote because it is disturbing that I'm intrigued and he is so young. 

Shame on me. 




 Just for a day! Or weekend.  




 ROLLING ROCK! My favorite. Touring the brewery this summer.  




 Come work at the Sylvania/Toledo Waffle House please.  




 He's awesome!  




 Idk how to isert pics on my phone lol  




 I'm only 22 years young, and nothing makes me feel old until my 9yo sister tells me my boobs are saggy.

Edit: they are immaculate 44DDD 




 I agree with this whole 100%. My boyfriend is an AMAZING guy. He knows absolutely every way to please me, mentally, physically, emotionally. He's not as big as some of the other men I have dated prior to him but that doesn't bother me at all. He's so wonderful and good with everything else it truly isn't something I think about.  




 Just keep swimming !! 




 Face looks like he's got a dildo shoved up his ass hole 




 Human eyes. 




 Idk maybe like 5-6 large ones and a couple handfuls of small ones. Steven Tyler is my spirit animal.  









 LOL WHAT THE FUCK.







I'd lose it. 
























 I am currently on POF. I have also labeled myself as "average" body type. I gained some weight when my kate fianc passed away. I have always been in great shape, and I am a very attractive woman. (I have been told by so many people throughout my life. No I do not have a big head.) Figured it would be good to get back into dating online and try things out. Although my body type says "average", I have lost 30+ in a few short months. I still have more to go. But by eating healthy and actually getting out of bed and starting my days makes that much of a difference- I was so depressed for the longest time. I do let the men I talk to know that I am on this journey and if they can accept me now, they will be more accepting when I reach my goal. 

I'm not telling you this to feel bad for me or anything, just sharing so you know not all "fatties" wanted to be that way. And that some of us are making the conscious effort to better ourselves.  




 Some people are so strange.  




 One time my (ex) boyfriend ate me out at a restaurant under the table. It was a really dark restaurant and the table clothes were touching the ground. The waiter came up to the table and realized he was missing said I could order for him if I knew what he wanted. I told her to come back in ten minutes that he left his wallet at home. Honestly that was the best ever and I do not feel guilty about it at all.  




 This has to be the funniest shit I have seen in FOREVER 




 Brandon Novak heroin.  




 That girls hair extensions look lime sheeeeiiiiittttt 




 STFU?! As sick as that is- completely badass. CHEERS.  




 Ohio is 80 




 This makes my heart happy.  




 I love you 




 Prozac saved my social life. My family could deal with my crazy shit but people around me didn't know how...Once I was put on meds, I actually had a true friend. 




 Hey, any time. Went through that recently as well. Roommate burned my kitchen down.  




 Positive vibes your way.  




 I worked at this place called The Barn. It literally is an old red barn from the 20's and opened as a bar in 1934. Anyways, we had a regular (way before my time), whose name is Frank. He passed away about 6-7 years ago. His wife still comes in. He was a huge Captain Morgan drinker and we have his "last bottle" in a shrine/glass box. Frank was know to really dislike rap music so when we had DJ's come in he would flight glasses straight across the bar. Not just push them, as if he was throwing them. When employees, including myself, would be making a burger in the back he would tell us when to flip them. Often I would be checking an I.D of someone's and if they were. underage I would get awalsy a swift tap on on the right shoulder. We knew it was him, never failed to amaze us though. 









 Mean Girls 




 First off I live on the edge of suburbia and corn fields. This girl got so drunk she said that she wanted to drive out to the country and hold a family hostage and torture them. She went into extreme detail about this. The whole time with a huge grin on her face.  




 I own a trailer. Nice one. Newly renovated. Got a roommate. He was struggling with some things had him pay $250 a month in rent. Cheap. Told him no smoking in the house. He got drunk and decided he wanted to make fried chicken. Started the process and then passed out on the couch with a cigarette burning. To my surprise it wasn't the cig that caught my trailer on fire.... He burnt the chicken. Caught my stove on fire and slept threw the whole thing. I work in a bar so I was just getting home around 4 A.M when I saw the paramedics, fire trucks and police officers. He came out unscathed and moved out the. next day. While I had no place to live considering majority of my place was gone. I had to move back home with my parents. Shit sucks. 

He got his karma a few months later- got pulled over for a DUI in someone else's truck with no insurance.

EDIT: I have multiple bad roommate stories. I have always had bad luck in this department. 




 Yeah of course, my cottage is right by there. Scio, Ohio. And I went there for a "religious retreat" (I went to Catholic schools didn't exactly have a choice!) 




 I'm from Sylvania, Ohio! Small world. About 30 mins from Yipsi. 




 What really kills my self esteem is when I'm having a great night at work, no tables have complained and everything is prompt. (Fine dining) And then all of a sudden a cook calls you a cunt in front of all the staff because HE fucked up the timing on the ticket. Broke me down. My tables heard and everything. Real self esteem killer.  




 Very interesting, thank you!  




 And what is the material they are made out of?  




 I always thought the Sorell had a little citrus flavor to them. I used to eat them all the time. Still do!  




 Ya and God forbid I wear actual panties and not a thong and my friends point it out. Jackasses ha 




 I just watched the trailer and I am terrified.
