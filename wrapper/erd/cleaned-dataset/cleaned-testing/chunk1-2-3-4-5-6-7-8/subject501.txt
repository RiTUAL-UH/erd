 Deakins is a technical genius. 




 Cornetto Trilogy!!! 




 **DONALD GLOVER MOTHERFUCKER!** 




 Like I said, It's just an opinion. 




 YOU'RE TEARING ME APART LISA! 




 It's comments like that that will earn you a few downvotes. 




 You just spoke about the cinematography of that film, and you didn't mention Emmanuel Lubezki? 




 They should've called this 'Patrick Bateman finds a soul'. 




 Prometheus..? 




 [My Reaction](http://giphy.com/gifs/smiling-watching-12A3hKKsewxtGE/fullscreen) 




 I liked the first one more, second one was....abysmal.  




 all fixed, sorry about that :) 




 If you judge the movie purely as a movie, It is very well made. I haven't seen anyone HATE on it, of course like any war movie it will cause some controversy (remember when The Hurt Locker came out?).
But I really don't really care about the controversy, because I always remember this: It's just a movie!!!!

(Please don't downvote, It's just an opinion) 




 Just thought I would ask /r/movies what there guilty pleasure movie(s) is/are. Mine would probably be Spiderman 3, Machete, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest and Con Air. Just leave yours in the comments! :)

Edit: Wow thanks for the comments, I never expected this many. But why I am I getting downvoted? :/ 




 keep watching!!!! 




 Maybe not 




 I've only cried in three films. Those are:

* Titanic
* King Kong (2005)
* Big Hero 6

I Know Right!
 




 I've been looking for this! Thanks so much!!!! 




 Just wanted to ask /r/movies what everyone thinks of The Reader, a 2008 film starring Kate Winslet, David Kross and Ralph Fiennes.

Wiki: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Reader_%282008_film%29

I think this is an incredible film with powerful and convincing performances from all three leads, this film is certainly not for everyone and it raised quite the controversy when it was released but nonetheless critics and people I know really liked this film. So yeah I just wanted to know what people thought of it, please leave your thoughts and opinion(s) in the comments. :) 




 Yeah that wasn't bad either. 




 "The chainsaw rises" is actually a fucking awesome title. No shit. 




 Am I the only one that thinks the 2004 remake was actaully pretty decent? (Please don't down vote, it's just an opinion). 









 Just wish this post was a little bigger so we get could more interpretations and opinions but thanks anyway!  




 The quote in my opinion may be referring to Riggan Thomson, take it with whatever weight you want but I think it does. 




 At the beginning of the film where the drums play away the letters and start to reveal the title of the film it pauses briefly and across the screen you can see the word 'Amor'. Amor, as it turns out, is the ancient Roman God of love (aka Cupid) Amor is also Latin for 'Love'. I did more research and as it turns out Amor is winged and is often depicted as being blind or blindfolded. Now you must also consider the name of the play that the plot (sort of) revolves around. And know a quote from Shakespeare's A Midsummer Nights Dream:

Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind
And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind.
Nor hath love's mind of any judgement taste;
Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste.
And therefore is love said to be a child
Because in choice he is so oft beguiled.

IMHO this quote is referring to Riggan Thomson (or is it the other way round?) The director and writer, Alejandro Gonzlez Irritu, is not directly linking Riggan to Amor (or Cupid) but simply a homage or tip of the hat. As the title of this post suggests I may be onto something here and if I am then I am no where near fully understanding this reference. I thought I might share this with you guys and perhaps discuss even further. :) 




 In the beginning of the film where the drums reveal the title, it says "amor" very briefly. Amor is latin for 'love', and also Amor is the ancient roman god of love. so you might be onto something. 




 That rape scene was gratuitous or was is supposed to be?  




 If you are genuinely interested in his work, I **highly** recommend the documentary 'A Life in Pictures' it is one of my favorite documentaries and I guarantee you will respect this man a whole lot more after watching it.  




 Thanks for all the downvotes! 




 Hmmmm.....Black Swan...Mila Kunis...and Natalie Portman....I LIKED that movie. 




 It's one of those comment threads where the comments just keep getting funnier as you scroll down. 




 Very well said, you've made a solid point. 




 Roger Ebert gave it 4/4 stars. What's up with that? 




 Zac's character in the film represents reality. 




 Hahahaha, honest to god. 









 Here you are! Well..not exactly.
I suggest you look through these until you find the one you are looking for, hope this helped!
http://screenmusings.org/movie/blu-ray/The-Cell/ 




 We should just clear this up: They shouldn't have remade the movie in the first place. 




 I loved the Neo-Noir element to the nightclub scene, or to the whole movie itself. I hope they keep that up in the sequel. 




 PG-13? Pffft 




 Or not. 




 hahaha this actually made me crack up :D (not being sarcastic) 




 Why did some people not like Watchmen? I really liked it.
(please don't down-vote me guys, it's just an opinion :)) 




 happy? 




 It must get pretty hot under that helmet. 




 Sicario may have a chance... 




 How does he notice the things he notices in film. How indeed. 




 D: 




 *Nightcrawler 




 Into the Wild.
I want to do what he does. 




 We'll see 




 This film will be epic. Lubezki will be at the top of his game, as will Irritu. 




 Do you have any idea who it's directed by? 




 Tom Hardy stealing the movie?? Did you even look at Leo in that photo? 




 Sneaky Little Fucker ain't he. 




 I have read the book, and my Stephen King collection is quite expansive. All I was saying is that I learned that he was nominated for a Razzie, I didn't know that before, but know I do. 









 Now that would just be GIVING it away. 




 Maybe his new film 'The Visit' is good. But then again, maybe not. 




 Everybody in the German army has heard of **Hugo Stiglitz**  




 This album reflects humanity. The good. The bad. And the ambiguity of it. Most of this album is actually a continuous song. Most of it. The songs within this album evoke mostly dark emotions, but they are very relaxing. The lyrics of these songs deal with some very heavy themes. Mostly, like I said, to do with humanity; society. But the themes and ideas displayed in this album is familiar territory for this band. They are certainly not for everyone, they are for me and hopefully for you, too.

[Masterpiece](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW5iwy69O1U) 




 Yes! But Oh Well, he was nominated for an academy award. 




 Anything Roger Deakins. 




 Just a question but does Micheal Corleone become worse in Part 2? I haven't seen it but I'm just asking. 




 No country for old men is not on the list. COME ON! 




 Christian Bale. He's been in two movies that start with 'American' and he's british! 




 I laughed so hard at that. Holy Shit. 




 Aaron Sorkin...That guy knows how to write a screenplay alright! 




 Hahaha yeah he does, maybe it's just the photoshop. I've seen him with it before though 




 Was the movie any good? 




 shiit. I'll edit it out. 




 Can some of you help me out with this post? It would be very very much appreciated!
http://redd.it/2u1zle 









 Ah that one, I got ya.

 The 57' one? 




 That's exactly what I'm looking for, Thank you. 




 Yeah pretty much any movie that's really heavy going in its subject matter or that just deal with some real heavy and dense themes, just mention em' here. Thanks! 




 He had a serious drug and alcohol problem. They can make the film interesting with that alone. With much character building, good actors, a consistent tone and a solid script, they could pull it off. 




 What we do in the shadows was pretty good. 




 Nah dude. Zodiac, now that's the real "Wow". 




 It is so disappointing that I have to scroll past comments and see racism about a fucking movie. 




 yeah the bad guys could've been better 




 End of Watch was fantastic. Come on dude. 




 **AMEN** 




 **KEEP IT THAT WAY** 




 Then go back into hibernation until Infinity War parts 1   2? 




 As Borat would say: Very Nice! 




 he used a revolver... 




 I genuinely think they are very underrated? Why don't you like them? 




 Who's joking with what? 




 Yes 




 Jarhead   American Beauty 




 That's because of his character, same reason why his character in Nightcrawler hardly blinks. 




 Jake Gyllenhaal hardly blinks in Nightcrawler (2014) 




 Oh Hi Mark! 




 Watch Foxcatcher. 




 Explain Foxcatcher? 




 Haha Lol you're getting down-voted. That's almost as funny as Channing Tatum in Jump street. Also, if he has '"flubbed" every role, explain Foxcatcher? 




 What 




 Yes of course. It's ultimately a character study. 




 It's a slow, tension-building film. Everyone needs to know that before going into this film. 




 Ahhh 




 I have no doubt about it 




 Whats happening...how can you read the script? 




 Someone watched an Honest Trailer. 




 Not yet! But I have ordered the bluray of it. Something tells me it will top John Wick. 




 A revenge tale starring Leonardo DiCaprio directed by Irritu with cinematography by Lubezki and co-starring Tom Hardy? 


JUST TAKE MY MONEY AND GIVE ME THOSE DAMN TICKETS!! 




 Nic Cage is playing an 'ordinary guy'? What is this? 




 Best action scene of 2014, hands down. 




 Doesn't work for me GODDAMMIT 




 Was just going to say that. 




 Dude have you seen True Detective? 




 The desolation of Smaug, the ending was so bad it even ruined the start of BOTFA for me. 




 This is shaping up to be my most anticipated movie of the next 5 years. 




 They won't put that in. 




 The title to this made me lose my shit. 




 Why did Nick choose to stay with Amy? I am completely stumped on this, can someone please help. 




 Bland? That's his character, read the fucking book. 




 Come on people where is Prisoners! 




 Always good to see a fellow Fincher lover. If you haven't seen Zodiac, I couldn't recommend it high enough. 




 Can't go wrong with Zodiac! 




 I got it from Sanity, in Australia. 









 As a fellow Aussie, did you get those at JB? 




 Ah. 




 Can't go wrong with Zodiac! 









 Anyone who is complex, has depth and is perhaps a bit of an anti-hero, please mention them here. 




 The book that is seen on his bedside table, can someone tell me what it is if they saw the title or just happen to know the book? 




 What makes a movie very well directed, what makes a director good or bad? 




 Please mention any movies that have really underrated cinematography and why you recommend them, thanks! 




 A dishonored sequel is definitely in the works or it has already been made. Just wondering what is everyone's thoughts and opinions, also what do and don't you want in this sequel? 




 Please submit your top 10 favorite movies here, I would like to see what I'm missing out on. Here's mine, no order (because it's impossible):

 How do you prove good cinematography?

 Everyone in this thread seems to think I don't have very good taste in cinematography. Yes, I have seen many, many films; but Interstellar has some of the best cinematography I've seen in a while. Some of my favorite DP's include Roger Deakins, Emmanuel Lubezki, Robert Elswit, Conrad L Hall, Vittorio Storaro.  

Some of my favorite films feature astounding cinematography these include American Beauty, Blade Runner, Alien, No Country For Old Men, There will be blood, Fight Club, Zodiac, Se7en, Inglorious Bastards and many others.

It's just my opinion, but I think Hoyte van Hoytema did a very good job in this film along with Chris Nolan.

 For those of you who have seen it, why is it getting bad/mixed reviews? What's wrong with it? How could they improve it? 




 Seen it. Love it. 




 There's a constant stream of animated films these days, but mostly they're either glossy Hollywood product (Pixar/Dreamworks), or Japanese anime. For adults wanting something different we have to wait for the likes of The Nightmare Before Christmas, Waltz With Bashir, Persepolis, or Aardman's films to turn up. Mary   Max is one of these films that comes as a complete departure from all the others, both in visual and storytelling style, and sticks in the mind because of it. I won't repeat the plot here, so I'll just mention a few pros and cons. The cons are obvious. Some people will be put off by the almost constant narration (which took me a while to get used to), the rather numerous calamities (a lot more than you'd expect if you thought this was just a kids film), and the sadness within some of these people's stories. It's actually a little surprising that the film got made without the people financing it demanding a script that was more tailored to appeal to a wider audience. What we get is something that feels a whole lot more personal than the higher profile animated films. It feels personal, and therefore real, and the explanation is that it was written from life by a director who has a real feeling and sympathy for people who don't quite fit into the world, and feel alienated or are misunderstood by others. Mary was partly inspired by the director's own childhood (and there's a little bit of Toni Collette's Muriel Heslop thrown in I suspect), and Max is also based on a real person he's been pen friends with (but so far has never met in person). The way the film handles his Asperger's Syndrome just feels different to how you'd normally see such an issue handled on screen. There's a constant stream of humour (ironic, dry, black, childish), and I really enjoyed the small perfect touches on growing up in an Australian suburb in the 70's and 80's, and the depiction of grey New York, as it appears to the easily frightened Max. The animation is constantly a joy to watch, and I highly recommend seeing it. Not to mention the top-notch voice acting from Philip Seymour Hoffman, Toni Collette and Barry Humphries.
 [Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_and_Max)


 









 Why all the hate for daredevil? 




 ahhh.....YES. 




 Direction is kinda weak at times and 'one note'.

The acting is pretty good.

Writing can be a bit flat at times but overall it's ok.

The cinematography...do I have to say anything? Roger Deakins yet again delivers a visual feast, every frame is crisp and balanced, the lighting is beautiful; it deserved that oscar nod. 




 Pumped for the movie? 




 Did you guys like it or not?  




 Tell me a bluray that you are willing to trade, the condition and region code.

This is REGION B only and in pretty good condition. 




 This just made my day. 




 Blade Runner and The Empire Strikes Back. 




 I totally agree. 




 Adaptation.

Irreversible

End of Watch

Anything Wes Anderson

Mary   Max (HIGHLY recommend)

 




 Paul Giamatti. 
Imagine [him](http://www.tvweek.com/blogs/tvbizwire/paul-giamatti.jpg) in full pennywise mode.
 




 So lets just start by saying that my eyes get really itchy when hop into bed. I don't know what is is but as soon as I lay down, they get all tingly and irritated.
So most nights I lay there rubbing my eyes for about 5 minutes or until I think enough is enough. 
I then usually stumble out of my room into the kitchen to get a cold flannel to put on my face.
The previous night I decided to put a flannel in the freezer to put on my face/eyes if they become itchy, which they did. 
So I got into the kitchen and staggered over to the freezer, seeing nothing but colors and shapes from the good, vicious and long rubbing that I gave them (come on it feels good), I opened the freezer (all lights were off btw) and grabbed the first thing that felt like a nice thick frozen flannel. I then zombie-walked my way back to my room and put the ice-cold solid piece of heaven on my face. 

Well I woke up the next morning; the pillow was red and so was most of my face. 
I thought I was in that scene from The Godfather, seriously, I was shitting bricks.
I then feel a soggy, warm and wet sludge-y like presence against my upper back/neck area. 
Well what do you know? It was the steak I was supposed to cook the previous night, wrapped in glad/plastic wrap. Most of the blood had leaked out from it and onto my face, pillow and some of my sheets. 
And of course the REAL frozen flannel was sitting in the freezer where I had left it. I swear it winked at me. 




 Are they? I didn't know that. 









 I would be great if you guys could give me some recommendations and advice, a link to a website that sells them would be great as well. Thanks in advance. 




 Google Images and trailer screenshots... 














 Why thank you 




 It does a little. 









 Wow dude, thanks for all that advice. Just a few questions:

What did you mean by 'some shitty bundle?'

Also, do know know any websites/books/resources that you think is a good starting point for somebody who wants to be a cinematographer?
 









 Can you guys give me some advice and point me in the right direction? It would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance! 




 Never seen The Breakfast Club.

Goodbye all my karma 




 That's the best damn summery I've ever heard.  









 I love every single one of PTA's films. Sure he's not for everyone, but he's my kind of filmmaker; dialogue heavy, contain dense and relevant themes, real and exuberant characters and top-notch writing and directing. 




 He's certainly not for everyone. 




 Not a PTA fan? 









 Good to see Inherent Vice on the list, was not expecting it. 




 Tell me, is your father a happy man?

 




 Just looking for anything that analyses the work of PTA. Please leave a link in the comments. Thanks! 




 In the T.V section, when I saw the words 'True' and 'Detective', I jizzed. 




 Why's that? 




 What did you think of Inherent Vice? (I'm asking everybody this) 




 She was a demon. 




 Nice to see Inherent Vice high up on the list. What did you like about it? 









 I have no idea why you are being downvoted, you made a sold point. 




 What about pro feminist? Because I've heard some people call it that. 




 Same here.  









 This thread is turning into the official discussion page for 'Inception' when it was released. 




 WHY are you getting downvoted? That's really quite pathetic. 




 I prefer them both the same, they are completely different genres. 




 For me it was Killer Joe, Se7en and The Chaser. 




 My vote for Zodiac made it in! :D 









 Yes! Thank you for commenting! I really want to get this video out there, it should be this video that has the most amount of views instead of some bullshit music video. So if you can, share this video with your friends and family. Like he said in the video, we can use the internet to unite and come closer. Thanks again. 




 I love every frame a painting. Watch his video on David Fincher. 









 So you have your mid shot, close up, long shot etc, but what exactly is an unconventional shot? I am new to cinematography. Please leave a response and an example from a film or something. Thanks a heap! 




 Snatch. 




 Start with South Korean films like:

* **The Chaser** (2008) HIGHLY recommend.

* **A Bittersweet life** (2005)

* **The Revenge Trilogy**

* **Snowpiercer** (2013-14)

And whatever else you can find :)
 




 No order:

**Edge of Tomorrow**

**Source Code**

**Inception**

**District 9**

**Interstellar** (Please don't downvote because of this)

**The World's End**

**Gravity** (or this)

**Oblivion**

**Wall-E**

**Pacific Rim** 




 Curious Case?  




 Oh, you have NO idea 









 District fucking 10. 




 This is the last director I'd expect to direct this. 
Nonetheless, he is a fantastic director. Just watch Prisoners.
 




 No Country for old men.

I would be hear for hours explaining the meaning of this film, so I'm just going to leave this here:
http://www.rogerebert.com/scanners/no-country-for-old-men-out-in-all-that-dark
 




 I wanna see Christoph Waltz as Franz Oberhauser! 




 True. Like women, r/movies is just one of those things that we'll never fully understand.

Goodbye all my karma. 




 [Zodiac](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0443706/?ref_=nv_sr_1) (2007), David Fincher 




 Won't that be the day... 




 In your opinion, what is a really good poster? 




 I agree, I was very surprised that Gone Girl didn't get a nod for best adapted. 




 What's your opinion? 




 Please don't tell me that you're one of those people who haven't seen all the performances. 




 Rosamund was ROBBED. 




 Look at his face, and imagine him in clown makeup. 




 It's my favorite book, and it will be co-written and directed by the guy directed one of my favorite tv shows (True Detective) so I am hoping this turns out good.

Here's a few links: 
http://screencrush.com/cary-fukunaga-it-very-scary/

http://screenrant.com/stephen-king-it-movies-2015-2016-director/

 




 Sources aswell as the producer have said that the remake will be much more true to the book, it will be dark, gritty and very violent. 




 Who are you supposed to be talking to? 




 AND simon pegg???? I thought he was the main character? 




 See what happens when you fuck a pussy in the face! 




 [Mary and Max](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_and_Max)

My favorite stop motion animation film and also my favorite black comedy.

I URGE you to watch it. 




 He would've made a great Pennywise. But even then he played the Joker so I don't think he would've accepted the role. 




 I was thinking Paul Giamatti 




 I actually agree with you. 




 You are on reddit movies my friend, it's just what's going to happen. 









 You're judging from a picture? That's mature. 




 Why the hell are you getting down-voted? 




 This is awesome news. But not as good as the day when I open my r/movies feed and see 'District 9 sequel announced'. 




 Michael Bay 




 Why can't this be the bluray cover? 




 Yeah this has been questioned over and scrutinized for years. I don't actually know, I think it's just an easter egg. 




 That's a dick thing to say. 




 It's annoying because I can't prove to you that I have not downvoted anyone on this thread. 




 Well for starters, and I forgot to mention this, but Cuaron did not deserve Best Director, that should've gone to McQueen. 
Best Picture nod for Gravity was, to the academy, a no-brainer but come on BEST picture? That nomination should've gone to Prisoners.
An Bullock nominated for best actress? really? That nomination should've gone to Emma Thompson or someone whose performance was better.
When I said 'that years gravity' to 'Shakespeare in love' I did mean nominations as well as wins. 




 It did win other awards... 




 Sure It deserved awards, just the amount that it won. There were much better films in terms of story, substance and acting. 




 Peanuts? more like the small bits of salt that are ON peanuts. 




 Such a rob 




 That year's 'Gravity' 




 Any move that won a major oscar like best picture, actor, director, whatever, just leave it in the comments :) 




 I was thinking L.a confidential for a sec before you said it was released within the past few years. 




 Yeah that 'joke' almost made me fall out of my chair, I was so not prepared for something so....crude? But yeah I didn't know what to think. That's not to say she didn't have a good ass! 




 I love it. It's such an adventure. 




 The church scene is easily one of the best action scenes of the year. 




 Starting a Bluray collection and I just want to ask r/movies what are some essential movies to own on Bluray? 




 Why the downvote? :/ 




 The ending to Se7en. 




 /r/Chris_Stuckmann
Turns out there already is one 




 Im trying to make a stylesheet for it but I dont know shit about CSS 




 Now that you said it, it actually is okay. 




 We should do it together. What do you say?
I think he'll appreciate it. 




 That's okay, just don't fuck it up. Cough *alien resurrection* cough 









 What camera did you use? 




 Can't wait for this. 




 I'll be sure to do that next time
 




 Thanks so much! 




 Thank you! 




 I remember watching this trailer that was a spin off/parody of the cheesy 80's retro action movies, it was a bit like Far Cry 3: Blood dragon in its style and in the trailer it was about a vigilante cop type-a guy who is sent back to fight the Nazis but is instead sent back to the dinosaur age. I know it sounds really weird but the trailer was awesome and anyone who knows about this movie please comment the title or link to trailer in the comments. Much appreciated :) 




 This may become the highest grossing film of all time. 




 I don't see why you were downvoted for that, you made a very solid point. Upvoted :) 




 Detective Loki from Prisoners. 




 With Reddit I really feel a sense of community and I can't get that by just searching it on Google. I want people's personal opinions and examples of what Neo-Noir is and sure I can find that on Google but like I said, I'd rather ask r/movies. Also just looking through your comments you really do look like you enjoy condescending and picking apart peoples opinions, so please, don't get angry over little stuff like this. :) 




 Holy shit thanks for that!!! 




 Well do you have a better choice?  




 I could search it on Google, but I'd rather ask /r/movies instead. I've been hearing those two words ever since I really started having a passion for movies, and I never really payed attention. But now I think it's about time I started to find out what it is. Please don't down vote just because I don't know what it is.

 How can something like that even exist?

 tell me what it is! 




 I don't even know anymore. 




 Okay what the actual fuck 




 what is this?

But yeah what is the most fucked up subreddit on here?

 I guess they are really saving Vision for the main event.

 Yes! FINALLY, same here!!!

The whole time I was thinking of Lancaster Dodd. 




 I'm mad at the fact that they can do something like that. I said 'how' they broke up their marriage, not 'that' they broke up their marriage. 




 Wow, you're judging my intelligence because I got an expression wrong....hmmmm okay. 




 Read my previous reply :) 




 Maybe I'm over-reacting a bit, and I normally take documentaries with a grain of sand, but this just really got to me. I just cannot believe what these bastards have gotten away with and how they treat their people. How they practically used people, such as Tom Cruise, to gain power and superiority. Also, how they basically destroyed his marriage to Nicole Kidman. Don't even get me started on that bastard Miscavige....

Like I said, how true can all this be? It seems pretty legit to me. I just wanted to see if anyone else feels the same way :) 









 this just puts mine to shame... 




 sorry all the photos are sideways 









 1. It (hmmmm bring me that remake)

2. The Stand

3. Bag of Bones

4. The Talisman

5. Pet Sematary 




 I feel the exact same way....about Spirited Away. 









 Has anyone heard anything? 




 I cannot remove the palm off my face... 




 Yeah the one I ordered from the UK was region B. Yeah I saw on eBay the ones from Japan were like $98!!! But yeah I was just wandering if they were actually releasing an Australian edition :) 




 I live in Australia, I just ordered the bluray out of the UK! Do you know if they are releasing it in Australia? 









 So you liked Spirited Away?

[This man](https://www.google.com.au/?gws_rd=ssl#q=hayao+miyazaki+movies) is a god, watch all of his films including the documentary they made about him recently.

Also, the [studio](https://www.google.com.au/?gws_rd=ssl#q=studio+ghibli+movies) he works for, watch all of their movies as well.  




 A Bioshock film. 




 Nightcrawler

Whiplash

Foxcatcher

Birdman 









 Killer Croc in Suicide Squad? Man this just keeps getting better and better.  




 Scene it. Pun intended. 









 I love Dredd, pity we won't be getting a sequel :/ 





























 At one point, you didn't know either. 




 what does TL:DR stand for? :P 









 Clint Eastwood hasn't directed a straight up comedy, not that I am aware of, so my guess is that it will be serious. 














 My respect for this man and his work just went through the fucking roof after my first viewing, I implore you to watch it. 









 Well I want to be a cinematographer, so really anything at all will do :) 









 Thank you very much 




 **I posted something similar to this on r/cinematography, but only few people could help me** 

I just wanted to see if you guys had some more/better recommendations. Any book to do with the art of visual storytelling or cinematography will be much appreciated. Thanks! 




 "You could land a jumbo fuckin jet in there!" 









 I am speechless. Your sir, deserve an award. 









 Watch 127 hourse.

James Franco KNOCKS IT OUT OF THE PARK. 




 I think this will be great.

The director clearly understands the character, as seen with that awesome test footage. 









 So I should? 




 Should I tag for NSFW? 









 What the fuck is going on here? 




 The work of Cujo... 




 [Very Naice!](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1979623485/borat.jpg) 









 [Very Nice](http://cdn.meme.am/instances/400x/11518290.jpg)

 




 Mr Brando himself. 









 Any books that would be good for someone learning about cinematography. Much appreciated! 




 I came here expecting everyone to be hating on it, I was pleasantly surprised. 




 Ha! 




 Fuck me. Source Code, End of Watch, Enemy, Prisoners, Nightcrawler and now this. Gyllenhaal's career is going the roof. 




 i'll check it out 




 wow, thanks a lot for that. 









 why all the downvotes? :/ 




 Marvel movies are my thing...

In a nutshell, I think recently with The Winter Soldier, marvel movies are becoming more cinematic. I think this is happening with AoU as well.

Read the link I sent the other guy. 




 I probably should've gone into a little more detail, but yeah that's exactly what I mean. 




 I shall. 




 What I mean is I didn't feel that the first one had the characteristics of a film, it didn't present itself as a MOVIE. I know that sound ridiculous and I probably will be downvoted but it's just how I feel. Don't get me wrong, I LOVED The Avengers, but throughout my life I wanted to see the characters that I grew up with put into a motion picture. Unfortunately, It just felt like an entertaining but shallow action film. I wanted more, I wanted a more 'cinematic' feel and look to it, and now I think that Joss Whedon has implemented this 'feel' into AoU, just judging by the 3 trailers. You get me

Edit: http://redd.it/2gxnax 

This guy knows what I am talking about, haha I just found this. 









 One of my biggest gripes with the first Avengers is that is wasn't cinematic enough. To me, it just didn't have that feel. From what I've seen as far as trailers go, I think the film has a much more 'cinematic' vibe to it. I can't say for sure, as I have not seen it yet. I hope it does turn out to be like that, as I believe that's how superhero movies SHOULD feel. Anyone else feel the same way? I would love the discuss this further. :) 




 So happy to hear that. I've actaully played a little bit of unity, the combat was great, as were the costumes, weapon selection and world design. I think it's worth getting just for those things alone. I've heard bad things about the missions and the story and lots of bugs. 




 I understand what it is like to lose someone close to you. That feeling of dread as the day they passed away on comes around. I've heard mixed things about Unity, I was thinking of giving it a chance as well. I hope you make it through the next week okay, like I said, PM me whenever. I will listen to anything you have to say. 




 Totally, talk to to me about anything. I used to play PC, my rig was soooo shit (i played on intel HD graphics). I played games like far cry 2 (one of my all time favs), skyrim, mark of the ninja, counter strike, the first assassins creed( again one of my favs). just games like that really, buuuuut i recently got a PS4, what an upgrade right? It's been great, i've just loaded up on games like gta 5, AC black flag, watch dogs and far cry 4. some of them are a little too disturbing for my taste (watch dogs) by i enjoyed all of them.

when you do finish work and go to the gamestore etc just have a think about the things we've been talking about previously, that should help a little.  




 Nice to hear! It feels good to be helping a person out like this, i am soo glad you are actually determined about making a change. Huskys are beautiful creatures. I never mentioned, i loved video games as well, feel free to talk to me about them. If your co workers are like that then yeah I do understand your situation, at least you have your cousin, family can be friends as well. Insurgent? not bad at all. summer (in america) is coming up so that's when all the awesome movies come out, like i cannot wait for Avengers age of ultron. 

If you don't mind, every few days i would like to PM you just to see how you are doing. 




 I am so happy that this is getting you to think. Please tell me what you want to do after your shift. Dogs are great, I recommend you look into that.

As for your coworkers, I see the problem. I think you can still form friendships among them, even if your interests are different. You strike up small talk and just go from there. Are they friendly? I find that talking about recent news, world events etc works a lot of the time, as most people are interested in these things.

Most of all I think you need time to yourself. I mean like taking a day off work as I mentioned or doing alternative things after work like going to the park, beach etc these things can help more than you think; just some peaceful time for self reflection. If you do end up watching the films I recommended please tell me what you think of them and if they impacted/affected you in any way. 




 Hmmmm yeah you really need to watch those movies I recommended. Fight Club changed me as a person, as did American Beauty, as both of the main characters in those films were just like me a few years ago and little bit like you too. If I changed, I believe you can too.

You said you have a full time job. Why not start looking for friends there? Or maybe a girlfriend. 

As for the drive home, eat dinner, bed at 10 thing, you really need to change that, as I can see that's part of what's dragging you down. Who told you that you HAVE to go to bed at 10? Who ever said you HAVE to go to work? Or even come home from work? Just take the day off one day, go to the park or beach or movies, just have a day to yourself. Pick a sunny, BEAUTIFUL day. Also, how about a pet? Dogs can be best, BEST friends. They can cheer you up, you can take them for walk, talk to them etc. You don't have to do the exact same crap everyday, no one ever said you did. We were put on this earth to live, you feel the emotions embedded in us, not be prisoners unto ourselves, and not to waste away our days. Is that how you want to remember your life? Doing the same things everyday? 




 I just re-read your post, I apologize for talking so much about myself; I feel like a dick. Here's me all Mr self-improved talking about my life and my happiness. I really do want to help you, I know that feeling, that feeling of just withering away slowly.  




 I know exactly how you feel. 

I used to be like you.

I recommend you watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipe6CMvW0Dg)

I keep happy using these 3 principles:

**1. (The most important IMO) Lotsa good movies, books, music and T.v shows**

That's right. I mentally deteriorate if I don't get good entertainment. It's important to me, it is what I value. I try to go to the movies as often as possible and I collect blurays and try to watch a movie a day. I also listen to a wide variety of music. Good music, not shit. This includes Elton John, Pink Floyd, ELO, Queen, David Bowie etc. Good books do the job as well. I LOVE Stephen King and I LOVE batman comics. That's just me. It's things like this that make us human.

**2. FRIENDS!**

You NEED people to talk to, it is an absolute necessity. And remember, it's QUALITY not QUANTITY. I have a medium-ish circle of friends who I am all close to, and they love me and I love them! If you are having a shitty day then you can ALWAYS talk to a friend about it, they will always listen, and that can help more than you may think.

**3 AN ESTABLISHED WAY OF SEEING THE WORLD THAT ISN'T NEGATIVE**

You need to know where are are and what you are. That may sound stupid, but you need to embrace everything. You are a living organism. We were not created by a superhuman being or whatever, unfortunately we won't find out until the day we die. But until that day we need to LIVE. Don't waste away your time, you are a human being for christ sake!! MAKE YOUR MARK ON THIS EARTH, you will only live once!! You need to have your own way of seeing things that isn't overly pessimistic or optimistic. I am a little bit in between. Also, try not to worry to much. I know a few people who let things like world hunger, poverty, terrorist attacks etc get to them, and I can see how much it drags them down. Don't let that terrible stuff get in your way!!! The way I see it, it's all background noise, unless it comes to me, which it never does.

Anyway, enough about me. Tell me about you. I really do want to help you out, and I will try my best.

Also, watch the following films (they helped me):

American Beauty (1999)

Birdman (2014)

Fight Club (1999) 

Silver Linings Playbook (2012)

Hope this helped, please respond!! 



 









 I misunderstood what you were saying when you said that it reminded you of the painter. I thought it was a condescending insult.

So what if people circlejerk? As soon as a talented director, actor etc starts being praised by a number of people they just accuse them of circlejerking.  




 I would genuinely find that interesting, thank you. 

So your comparing my drawing (which was a VERY quick sketch btw) to that of a down syndrome painter?

Also, why did you tell me to shut up in the first place? Do people discussing cinematography usually piss you off? 




 I love SoS, have you heard the Alchemy Live version? It's like the original except on steroids. 




 ??? 




 If I made a list, that film would be on it alright. 




 This is actually making me laugh. Come one dude, you started this, and to be honest I don't want this to go on any further. 

Also, would a 9 or 10 year old draw inspiration from artists such as Tim Burton and Ralph Steadman to draw a character from a **PAUL THOMAS ANDERSON FILM?**  




 I've just been looking through your profile. How old are you? 




 Apocalypse Now, The Godfather I   II, The Last Emporer and The Conformist are fucking amazing. 









 I see what you mean.  




 *reincarnation 




 As is Skyfall and most of Deakins' other films, including Unbroken. 




 Also, which ones do you think match a film **perfectly**? 




 His upcoming film the revenant, may just be it.
I don't see any oscar caliber perfomances in the months to come, but what can I say? I haven't seen all the films this year but the only oscar territory perfomances I can see coming up so far are Michael Fassbender as Steve Jobs and Leo as Hugh Glass in 'The Revenant' (did you see the image they release of him!? JESUS he looks intense) 




 Range? That's ok, I understand what you mean. 

But if you want to see range from him just watch What's Eating Gilbert Grape. 




 2007.

No Country for Old Men 

Zodiac

There Will be blood

And countless others, I would be here forever. 




 We got Drive in 2011... 




 Why's that?
 




 He's just cruisin' along. 




 Personally, I enjoyed the first. The second? Not so much. To me the second volume was Von Trier's typical pessimistic style of film making and to a degree the first volume as well. But the ending to the 2nd volume really bothered me. As I stated before, It is a very pessimistic film. You are basically watching a character on a downward spiral, but the 2nd volume just went full Von Trier-hate the world mode, and I did not appreciate it.

Back to the first volume. Like I said, I genuinely enjoyed the first film. Although I would not watch it again, it was probably the most realistic you can get when covering that subject matter, and it didn't go over the top with it. Now you're probably think to yourself 'well, yes it did. Just look at the sex scenes!'. But the thing is, like I said, this is the most **realistic** take on this subject matter as you can get. And so while the graphic and sometimes unwatchable sex scenes are pretty intense, they are not over the top and gratuitous; they are simply realistic.

Anyway, that's my thoughts on the film. Please don't downvote! There is no need to as these are just my opinions. Yes I know my grammar is all over the place; I am not much of a writer.
I would love to here your thoughts on the films, like I said, please don't downvote if you disagree just post your argument in the comments and I will be happy to discuss :) 




 thank you for that...
 




 I know :'( 




  Michael Keaton in Birdman or The Unex- no 














 Interstellar

Moon

Interstellar

Moon 




 State of Play I thought was underrated. 




 *Extinction.  




 Yes, this will dominate the oscars. 




 Given the fact that Skyfall was one of the best Bonds in recent memory, how do you think they will top it? 

I would love to hear your skepticism or excitement for this film!

edit: why am I being downvoted? 




 Is that a Dark Knight reference? 




 For what purpose did he sacrifice everything to become a whistleblower? 




 Please keep this EXTREMELY basic but please do include specific examples. Thanks! 




 The Revenant may be it... 














 Ohhh I thought it was the complete opposite
 




 Yes I have 




 What is this subreddit actually about? Apparently you guys don't like Chris Nolan films..

SOMEONE PLS EXPLAIN! 




 This whole subreddit is about posting stills from movies... 
























 Where did you get all your star wars knowledge from? did you build it up over time? From where? 




 What IS canon? 




 Because of the force awakens right? 




 Thanks, do you have a link to where I can buy it? 




 I need to expand my knowledge of the SW universe, what are some good books, websites, tv shows etc that can help with this? I want to know more about the whole world including people, events, planets etc. Thank you very much!

Also, just a side question, what do we know so far about Episode 7's villain Kylo Ren? What is his place in the universe? 




 NSFW just in case. 









 Somebody needs to edit it onto the Batman v Superman trailer 




 I forget the name but there is one about the making of Apocalypse Now. Heart of Darkness I think it's called, it's about how much of a fucking nightmare the production of the film was.

Also, there's another one about film vs.digital cameras, the evolution of them both, which is better and why and where they are both going as in the future. It's called by Side by Side. 




 Fallout: Mad Max

Not that that's a bad thing... 




 Where is a good place on the net to start learning about the basics? Things like the different types of cameras, lenses, cameras in general and just the technical part of cinematographer, if someone could link me to a website, video etc that covers the basics of these topics, I would much appreciate it!

Also, does anyone know of any REALLY good books/essays on cinematography that would help a beginner like me?

And finally, does anyone know of any cinematography analysis videos/ essays? Anything that analyzes famous scenes or shots from films, or just analyzing someones work in general.

Thanks in advance!!

 Really? 




 That means every DC movie up until then will have IMAX scenes. 




 Murph 




 I am no pleb, I am a disciple of /r/moviescirclejerk 




 Thanks 




 He had a small role in Lincoln (2012). He was pretty good in that, but Daniel Day Lewis devours the screen. 




 What does that stand for? 




 American Beauty and Fight Club made me have a completely different outlook on life. After watching those films, I decided that I would NOT get a job where I'm stuck in an air conditioned room for hours on end doing a job I hate. I thought that waking up every morning at 7:00 and driving to the same place in the same clothes doing the same shit was NOT the definition of life and living. Unfortunately, I find myself looking down at these people who are stuck in this world; prisoners unto themselves and their jobs. I need to live, I can't be held back by working for people I despise. I want to be a cinematographer, a job where I can be outside and in different environments using my hands and skills to create films; a job where I meet different people, a job that I can learn and grow into.

Also, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipe6CMvW0Dg) youtube video also helped shape my new way of thinking.   




 If you liked it, check out Lock, Stock and two smoking barrels as well!! 




 That would be Snatch.

Awesome movie. 




 Well this is interesting. I actually liked the first one, but it's faults were definitely in it's writing. Fingers crossed for this and Blomkamp's Alien film, which I am skeptical about. 




 Only a poster.
http://i.imgur.com/0rlgnID.jpg

I should imagine we'll get one within the next 2 weeks.

edit: He said on Twitter it comes out this week 




 http://screenrant.com/girl-dragon-tattoo-movie-sequels-fire-hornets-web/ 









 I was just waiting for the fucker to bite the guys arm off. 




 * Daniel Day Lewis - Daniel Plainview, There Will Be Blood

* Brad Pitt - Tyler Durden, Fight Club

* Jake Gyllenhaal - Detective Loki, Prisoners - Louis Bloom, Nightcrawler

* Not a movie but Mathew Mcconaughey - Rustin Cohle, True Detective

 




 This may be the next Guardians of the Galaxy. I mean, sure I have my doubts, but this looks like a fun movie just judging from the trailer. Kids will enjoy, maybe even the parents. This could be a fun film the whole family can enjoy. Just kidding, this will probably be fucking terrible. 









 Yeah true. When the new 'It' remake comes out, I think it'll be very very good. It might have what your looking for, as it is about friendship and growing up, just with an evil ass demonic alien in there somewhere. (The book) is a beautiful coming of age story, I highly recommend it. But yeah the movie when it comes out will be just what you're looking for if it's good, which I'm sure it will be.
(I mean come on, the remake is written and will be directed by the same guy who did True Detective!) 




 Im looking forward to The Visit. Looks like M. Night is going back to his roots with this one. Fingers crossed! 




 Dazed   Confused...? 




 I love it. I love Finchers style, so smooth and subtle and not over the top. I love the twisted eerie soundtracks that he uses in his films, I also love his under-lit environments. He'll do over a hundred takes of a scene just to get it right, I think people need to appreciate that. Apparently the other 2 are still going to happen, which makes me very happy. If you liked this then definitely check out his other films, especially Zodiac.   




 "Honey, get the shot gun" 




 "Do you bleed? You will"

That is an epic ass line. 









 We'll need more info 




 I wish. 




 [What Batman thinks about your opinions of the new trailer](http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2013/037/e/1/middle_finger_batman_by_babs9-d5u3guy.jpg) 




 Is it as intense and sleek as the first 2? 




 Please don't spoil anything or give away too much, I'm just looking for some opinions on S3, is it as good as the others?

Thanks! 




 Anything that analyses the graphic novel. A link to a website or video would be great! I missed a lot of stuff in the book, i really want a better understanding. Also, the same for Arkham Asylum, anyone know a good analysis for that? Thanks a lot!! 




 oh... 




 The statue is not CGI, or the graffiti.

At some point in the film, public opinion will go against superman. Maybe something will happen, I don't know. 

When that 'something' happens, that's arguably where Bats comes into it.

People will turn against Superman in this movie, he might lose friends, politicans will want him, the military will want to contain him, all sorts of variables have been brought into the game as described by the teaser. So despite all this, will superman lose it? Will he lose faith in humanity? How do we know he won't be influenced by a villain, or be corrupted in some sort of way? The theory is that batman will be this sort of test, physically he wouldn't be much of a test, but mentally he would be.  




 Oh damn
 




 Wassat? 




 An old Joker.

Imagine the possibilities...  









 I've never seen a film in IMAX. How good is it, honestly? 




 Is this IMAX quality?  




 OP, can you please explain? 




 Because if you've seen the film Birdman, you'd understand. Also, it's a parody/turn on [this](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=birdman+poster biw=1536 bih=731 source=lnms tbm=isch sa=X ei=IjwzVZT2B4X5mAWdpIHoDg sqi=2 ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ#imgrc=5P4cztbW0Xn-nM%253A%3BMNdGgvPqs7I3DM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.impawards.com%252F2014%252Fposters%252Fbirdman_xxlg.jpg%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.impawards.com%252F2014%252Fbirdman_xxlg.html%3B1278%3B2000) poster

 Ok, does he kick ass? 




 Without spoiling it, how much is Vision in the film? Pls don't say too much! 




 I feel jealous, because you had the absolute pleasure of watching it a first time.  




 wow, thanks for that.

However, could you elaborate a little more on why batman and superman fight? What did you mean by batman testing supermans resolve?  




 Did Batman ever take any shit? ahaha 




 As of yesterday, a cross between Whiplash and Birdman. 

Yes, I shit you not. 




 Now that you mentioned it, I totally agree. I thought Gosling was supposed to be directing it, my bad! 




 What can you guys learn about this bruce wayne from the trailer? Any comment/speculation would be much appreciated!

I'm trying to get a solid idea of what this portrayal of batman is about. What are his motives and values? I can tell that this is a completely different BW/Batman altogether, I just want to know why? 




 I hope this happens, but I'm not sure if Gosling is the right choice.  














 what? 




 Instead of exhausting Batman's origin story, put him in a completely new setting with characters and themes that we haven't seen before.
I was thinking of a Arkham Asylum-ish story. Never have we seen Batman psychologically torn, put him right in the middle of insanity, and see how he pushes through it. Now THAT would be interesting.

For those of you who don't know, Arkham Asylum: A serious house on serious earth is a graphic novel, arguably one of the most disturbing and dark. Basically what it is about is there has been an outbreak in AA and Batman has been requested by the Joker, so he has to go over there to sort everything out. Ultimately, it's a psychological horror book. 

The book deals with themes of insanity, and it literally looks like and is meant to symbolize a nightmarish ordeal. What I am trying to get to is that this would be a completely new on-screen reincarnation of the character.

 I think we need to see a human, vulnerable and scared batman.
Maybe we've already seen that with Nolan's trilogy, but I just really want to see Batman and insanity in the same movie together, and to see how he deals with it and vice versa.

Also, I think going with this tone and story, would bring a completely different take on the DC villains. So batman locks up these villains in insane asylums and prisons, then what? They are left to whither and die in filthy and disgusting environments. Seeing this I think would be brilliant. 

Let me know your thoughts! I would love to hear other people's opinions on this. Yes I know, I am no writer. If you still don't know what I am trying to say, just comment or PM me, I'll be happy to elaborate.

TL;DR- I want to see [this](http://www.merlininkazani.com/images/games/7764/galeri_4.jpg) on screen. 




 where can I get me one of those figurines? 

ARRGHHH PLEASE TELL ME! 




 Reservoir dogs  




 Since the first season did feel like a 8-9 hour long movie. 









 A have heard talk of a stand alone batman film, DC have announced it, but it is far from production. 




 At first I was laughing, then I remembered that this movie is actually coming out, then I cried. 




 Legend. 




 Hahaha 









 No order:

- Avengers

- Star Wars (hmm that trailer though)

- Spectre

- Mission Impossible Rogue Nation

- The Revenant 

Edit: also movies like fantastic four, ant man, Jurassic world, Southpaw I am also looking forward to. 




 Fight Club style? 




 Oh damn. 

This film is going to be biblical.  




 I recently watched the documentary 'The Kingdom of Dreams and Madness'. **SPOILER AHEAD** It says at the end that he has retired, but on his retirement sheet/form or whatever it says that he wishes to continue making anime for 10 more years. What does this mean? Is he working on something right now? I am so confused, I have found so many different things on the internet about what is going on with him. Can somebody PLEASE explain what is happening? Thanks so much!!

**I DON'T WANT HIM TO RETIRE :'(** 




 I just googled your whole description except for the beginning. 

I think the movie you are talking about is Wild (2014) 




 I doubt it. I think he took the pictures with a very good camera and later uploaded them to instagram via his computer. 




 I have asked people, they say I am not selfish and they say that I do not sound that way. Maybe it's just them trying to be nice. I just feel I sound that way, I'm not sure if people think the same or different to be honest. I said 'I' way too many times in this comment :/ 




 No of course not. 




 Thank you very much 




 I find that when I talk to people I sound snobby and selfish. I feel like the tone of how I talk sounds like only my opinion matters. I do not have any of these intentions however, It's just how I feel I sound. How do I get rid of this? I don't want to come off any selfish to people, as I am not a selfish person. Any help would be much appreciated, if you want me to elaborate further just ask! Much Thanks! 




 Oh, I got mine from JB-Hi-Fi, they had The Wind Rises, Kiki's Delivery Service and this. 




 Yep 




 Where did you get it? 




 You are welcome :) 




 Where's Spirited Away? O_O 




 Sleuth?  




 O.O

*sigh* Now I need to watch it again.. 




 You can get one [here](https://www.mightyape.com.au/product/Howls-Moving-Castle-10th-Anniversary-Limited-Edition-Blu-rayDVD/22816515) 




 Haha, I was in the shop just looking for the normal bluray for Howls moving castle when I look towards the end of the isle and I see a stand with that edition sitting on it. I just stared at it for 30 seconds straight. Then, as plain as a robot, I put the normal bluray back onto the shelf, walked towards the 10th anniversary edition, picked it up bought it, and marched out of the shop. My face was as blank as paper. 




 I wish they did one for Spirited Away.... 




 I am looking forward to ALL of those as well, also the new Steve Jobs movie is going to be awesome as well. 




 For The Revenant Im guessing. 



















 Absolute shite. 




 I was too goddamn late, but thank you. 




 The Godfather part 2. Because I haven't seen it and it's meant to be one the greatest films of all time. 









 Sorry, but what goes on here? Can someone please explain! 




 Awesome collection! They must be worth quite a lot by now. 




 Actually, I really quite like it. It's almost like that idea is a minimalism in itself.  









 You are very talented 




 Yeah it does have some unexpected humour. 




 I am currently 3 quarters of the way through the book, I am enjoying it so far, it is a little slow but that never seems to bother me in books or movies. Most of what's happening in the book seems to be build up, does it pay off in a big epic awesome way? Without spoiling anything, is the ending satisfying? What do you guys think of the book overall?  




 I am happy that he mentioned that infinity war part 1 and 2 will be separate stand alone films, instead of cliffhanger bullshit they pull nowadays.  




 I read that wrong. I read 'Stephen King to adapt Dark Tower series for Sony'.

:( 









 'It' is my fav, is the stand better than that? 




 hahahaha thats Vampires kiss 




 Everyone keeps saying its his best book. Please, I want to read it, I just need some encouragement from people who have read it!!

 They announced that as the series progresses, he adds padding onto his suit. Has anyone noticed this yet? I am only up to episode 4, for those of you who have seen further, does the suit get bigger/ better? 

I have no idea why I want to know this but whatever, thanks! 




 Oh, I think his line delivery is very authentic and overall good. 




 why do you think that? 




 So Marvel's Daredevil has just been released on Netflix, what do you think of it? I am liking the dark and gritty tone, also Charlie Cox as Matt Murdock is working out very well, supporting cast are also great. Let me know what your thoughts are :) 




 you're a little late 




 Nic Cage. 









 /r/TrueFilm will help you out. 




 What the actual fuck.  




 I approve. 




 Really? 




 big hero 6 




 He looks pretty good. My hopes for this film have only escalated.  









 About time. 




 onetruegod is hilarious.  




 The goddamn fucking pop-ups. The only thing that should be popping up is..well.....you know... 
























 What? 




 I loved the cinematography. Robert Elswit is one of my favorites, he shot two of the most beautiful looking films of 2014: this and Inherent Vice. 




 With example.

Thanks!! 




 His career, oh man his career. It would've gone places. 




 Wow that's pretty neat. 




 Hello again.

Pretty much most of the films on the list, out of the ones I've seen anyway. 









 Nope, who knows maybe they'll put him in right at the last second. 




 Great movie btw 














 Can somebody tell me a little about this character? 




 AWESOME!! 




 It's playing here in Perth.  




 Please provide examples as well. Thanks! (I'm new here) 




 Also, can someone please give a better/more appropriate subreddit to post this on, thanks! 




 Deepthroatin'  




 Holy.......fuckin shit. 









 A Paul Thomas Anderson collection. 




 That is hilarious. 




 He was fired? I didn't know that. 




 My dad was telling me that when he was in Germany, he was in this souvenir shop and this american guy was trying to buy all this merchandise with American dollars. He kept arguing with the woman who wouldn't take the dollars and saying how he needs to convert the currency to Euros. The American didn't understand and kept saying (in a typical American accent) "These are American Dollars! You gotta take the dollars GODDAMN!!" 




 Maybe. But Star Wars The Force Awakens will be. I guaran-fucking-tee it. 




 I think we shouldn't have evolved so far. I mean look, we're destroying the planet! I would rather be living happily in my straw hut or in a fuckin tree and hunting for food everyday with my spear or bow and arrow than be living in this world. Honest! 




 Watch a Disney movie.  




 NSFW because I'm not sure how weird this is going to get 




 Oh thank you so much. I'm good now, It's just been a very emotional day. Thank you so much for asking :) 




 Let me know your thoughts!

Also if you enjoyed that one i recommend you check out [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzkTbO78L5k) trailer as well! 




 wow, that was a surprisingly effective response.  




 Have you seen the trailer? 




 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_films_based_on_DC_Comics

Go down to the bottom of 'other potential projects'. I stuffed up the wording, they haven;t announced it yet, my bad. 




 Well I actually just finished watching Into the Wild. I cried my fucking heart out okay? I'm not going to explain why, just watch the film and you'll find out. That's twice I've cried today :'( 




 The Batman Arkham games? Fuck yeah 




 Ummm why all the downvotes? 




 Fuck, I forget to mension shutter island. Awesome movie! Underrated! 




 Fight Club 




 That first teaser for the last airbender had me fucking stoked.

Also the Man of Steel trailers, although MOS was not as bad as people say it was. 




 I actually held my hand in front of the screen at first. It didn't fucking help. 




 Holy fucking shit! His assistant just smiled when he fell down! Man that is some of the most unsettling shit I've ever seen. 




 Upvoted. I totally agree with you.  




 Drive, There will be blood, Into the Wild, Inherent Vice, Whiplash, Birdman, Mystic River, Saving Private Ryan, Apocalypse Now, Schindlers List, The Master, Boogie Nights, The Dark Knight, Inception, Fight Club, American Beauty, Not a movie but True Detective, Eastern Promises, Blade Runner, Alien, Aliens, The Raid, The Raid 2, The Matrix, Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, The Godfather part I II, Raging Bull, The Wolf of Wall Street, The Departed, Gangs of New York, 21 Grams, Star Wars 4, 5 and 6, Fargo, Prisoners, No Country for Old men, Lawrence of Arabia, Lincoln, Minority Report, Moneyball, The Social Network, Zodiac, Gone Girl, Seven, The girl with the dragon tattoo, The Game, Nightcrawler, Avengers Age of Ultron, Oldboy, Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle, Princess Mononoke, My Neighbor Totoro, Silver Linings Playbook, 12 Years a slave, Boyhood and City of God are all some pretty fucking amazing movies. I hope you appreciate that I wrote all these movies here for you. 




 How violent is it? How is the action? 









 "Fine I'll do it myself" FUCK YEAH ABOUT TIME THANOS! YOU STILL HAVEN'T DONE SHIT!! 




 Yes I agree. I've never heard echoes or wings for marie, but I will check them out. 
With me, I melt away when I listen to 'Breathe' by Pink floyd as well as the rest of the album.  




 I feel the EXACT the same way you do. I have a similar first experience with this song. I was in Germany with my family visiting my grandparents, I remember getting Love of Gold for my 10th birthday (Yes, I was way a head of my age with music, books and film; I still am)  and I remember waking up at exactly 7:00 in the morning and walking into the out onto the front porch  with the CD. It was beautiful outside, the sun was rising and the snow was gently melting off the grass and trees; it was beautiful. I remember sitting down and putting the CD in the player they had on the porch. For the whole 14 minutes I was blown away, just sitting on the porch to my grandparents house, looking out across the grass and forest. I'll never forget that day, after that I would listen to the song every morning. It is unarguably one of the best songs ever written and performed. Words can't even describe it. 




 Fuckin A 









 Dont downvote this, it's pretty cool
 




 I bet the picture of the joker and this pic of bats are exact reactions to eachother. 




 Fucking love this movie, I can't even describe what it's about. I didn't even know what the fuck is going on half the time, but something tells me you're not supposed to... 




 Noooooo that annoying little kid from Hugo? Seriously?  




 OP, what's actually happened? 




 Wow, awesome video! What's your favorite of his? 




 Now THAT was an excellent fucking trailer.

Sold. 




 Hell yeah! 




 Instead of exhausting Batman's origin story, put him in a completely new setting with characters and themes that we haven't seen before. I was thinking of a Arkham Asylum-ish story. Never have we seen Batman psychologically torn, put him right in the middle of insanity, and see how he pushes through it. Now THAT would be interesting.

For those of you who don't know, Arkham Asylum: A serious house on serious earth is a graphic novel, arguably one of the most disturbing and dark. Basically what it is about is there has been an outbreak in AA and Batman has been requested by the Joker, so he has to go over there to sort everything out. Ultimately, it's a psychological horror book.

The book deals with themes of insanity, and it literally looks like and is meant to symbolize a nightmarish ordeal. What I am trying to get to is that this would be a completely new on-screen reincarnation of the character.

I think we need to see a human, vulnerable and scared batman. Maybe we've already seen that with Nolan's trilogy, but I just really want to see Batman and insanity in the same movie together, and to see how he deals with it and vice versa.

Also, I think going with this tone and story, would bring a completely different take on the DC villains. So batman locks up these villains in insane asylums and prisons, then what? They are left to whither and die in filthy and disgusting environments. Seeing this I think would be brilliant.

Let me know your thoughts! I would love to hear other people's opinions on this. Yes I know, I am no writer. If you still don't know what I am trying to say, just comment or PM me, I'll be happy to elaborate.

TL;DR - I want to see [this](http://www.merlininkazani.com/images/games/7764/galeri_4.jpg) on screen

edit- of course all of you know what Arkham Asylum is! Duh! (stupid me) 




 Let's not forget that the guy who re-wrote Batman v Superman has won an academy award for best adapted screenplay (Argo) 




 The Heat I thought was pretty decent. 




 Wow, I had no idea insomnia was a remake or that the prestige was adapted from a book. 




 Roger motherfucking Deakins. The man is a god. 




 An original film. Like he always does. 




 OP, you're a hero, but you seriously need to get rid of that job and find something you actually enjoy doing. I wish you all the best. 




 I agree. David Ayer nor Zack Snyder are perfect directors, with that said they have done VERY good movies in the past. End of Watch is one of the most underrated movies of the decade and, personally, I enjoyed 300, Man of Steel (although far from perfect)and Watchmen.
I'm hoping they don't stuff up the iconic characters they are dealing with. Both films have potential to be really bad, but they also have potential to be really really good. 




 Just need a little help, I saw on the cover of Death of the family, where you can see the Joker's face, It says "Volume 2". Do I need to read Vol 1? Or any of the crossover tie-in stories?  









 FTFM 




 What

The

Actual

Fuck 




 That guy seems to be enjoying it... 




 My father once called me a "fucking little cunt" when I was about 12. 




 Just post it to imgur and link it below! Also, please explain why it's your favorite, thanks! 









 Awesome! Let me know your thoughts after! 




 How?

Wow, thanks for all the downvotes! 




 ^ 




 Well, IMO, this is the best thing Marvel have done. It is (**IMO**) better than the first. It is slightly better than Daredevil, but I think it's a little unfair to compare those two as they are completely different. 

You get to spend a lot more time with the Avengers as characters, the humor is more present and a lot better than everything Marvel have done, the action is better handled than the first, the villain is much more interesting and funnier than Loki (not to say that he was a bad villain) and there's more Avengers- Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch and Vision (ESPECIALLY Vision) make great additions to the team. It improves upon everything!

 




 I fucking loved it, one of the best films of the year already.

I was surprised, I didn't expect it to be as good as it was. They really fleshed out all the characters, especially Hawkeye. I was surprised that Ultron was so funny...in a dark but good way.  




 The soundtrack hits hard. It was modified by Danny Elfman and that really translates onto the screen. It's great, and they use it at the most appropriate times.    




 One, and it's fucking epic. 









 They announced that Thanos would NOT make an appearance in Age of Ultron.

Sneaky fuckers they are.  




 No I'm afraid not.

Whaaaaaaat thats so cool! I need to find this now!!

The hunt begins! 




 FINALLY! an aussie collector.

Where did you get that version of dredd? 




 Yeah, it had just never been posted on here before, which I found surprising.  




 Hahaha true true 




 This sounds like a story. It is a leak from one of the crew members?
"an acclaimed actor" are you sure it isn't DiCaprio who was fighting with the director?  




 This just may be it. 




 and PTA? what do y'all think about him? 




 Yeah apparently they can only shoot a few hours at a time because the area where they are shooting is (mostly) untouched by man. Where did you learn that he's being a dick? Do you have a source on that? 




 Yeah I was a bit surprised to learn that they were shooting in NY. I also read somewhere that they are shifting the timelines as well, so that the childrens story will be set during the 80's and the adult story will be set in the 2010s.  









 Spiderman: That's right Sony, Fuck Off! 




 What the fuck!? They're shooting the 'it' remake in New York??? WHY? WHY WHY WHY WHY. This is my favorite book! Why are they setting it in the city??????????? It wont have the same effect as if it were set in a small town! 




 This should be pretty good. I hope so. 




 Exactly like murder. Why didn't I say that? 




 It means kill. So a snuff film is basically a porno except at the end, they kill either the man or the woman. Like they genuinely kill one of the actors in the porno. Sometimes they fake it, sometimes not... 




 Oh, I was under the impression that in some point during the film the tribe just randomly attacked the crew. Man, that is a fucking weird movie. 




 Sorry about all the questions, last one!

Did the tribe go apeshit when they found out the crew were hurting animals?

I'm too pussy to look this shit up, I'm afraid I'll see what you were talking about D: 




 So this tribe, are they friendly at first? You mentioned they go ham, I thought this meant they were ok in the beginning.  














 What the actual fuck. That's not even a movie. 




 I haven't seen the film what happened with the turtle   the monkey? 




 I dunno, It's just a thought.

Maybe when you exit the womb, you gain consciousness, so at the same time the life has left your previous body, it enters your new infant baby body. 




 *reincarnation  




 NSFW just in case.
  




 Wow, your collection is fucking amazing. Some great movies there. 














 What are your thoughts on the film? 




 This film is going to be biblical.  




 well....it looks kinda....fucking terrible. 




 Wow Depp is playing a normal character for once. This looks incredible. 









 OP, do you know if this girl is in the shit w/ her parents? How did your friends sister react to it? 




 I agree. He just starred in a gritty crime drama called 'A most violent year' and now the guy is about to be in one of the biggest films of all time (Star Wars, yes I'm calling it now) AND then he'll go on to star as a villain in a superhero movie! And that's just what I know of! 




 Both of the Antagonists in those films deserved their end. 









 Well, It'll make more than Skyfall did.

I think it may be better than Skyfall, as Mendes said that this will top it. 




 I really don't know what to say. Like......fuck.... 




 Why must Scarlett Johansson be so goddamn hot?

Anyway, I'm pumped out of my mind for this. If only it wasn't produced by Dreamworks they could go for a much grittier tone, more true to the original. 




 Not an action movie but Fight Club is up there with the great 90's films. 




 That interviewer, what a fucking idiot.

I've seen him before and I've never liked him, this just cements by opinion of that prick. 




 PLOT TWIST: The cookies are....evil.

I don't fucking know, alright? 




 GHOST IN A SHELL ARRRRGHHHH YEAHHHHSSSS 




 Could you elaborate on the first sentence? 




 I forgot this was coming out. It'll probably be terrible. 




 This hurts. 




 Birdman or American Sniper?

Or Whiplash 




 2010 - Inception

2011 - Drive

2012 - Django Unchained

2013 - Prisoners

Guess anyone? 




 [This shot](http://i.imgur.com/z2ybobW.png) from the trailer sold me. The first time I saw it, I thought to myself, THAT is Star Wars.  




 Is this just for America? Are there posts like these except for australia??? 




 Without giving too much away, how was Vision? Does he kick ass? 




 I actually agree with you there, I have always found villains to be much more interesting. 












































 This is incredible. I was so immersed in this video alone I was expecting the actual movie to start playing :( 




 I learned quite a bit from that. Thanks! 









 It really is the little things. 









 That's got to be the worst poster I've ever seen.

 Enjoy! It's my favorite. 




 Is that...sarcastic or.....? 




 Yeah but I cant see how Mad Mac Fury Road is 'art'. It's a fun summer action movie. 




 I read that in his voice.  




 What he said. 




 Read it. Love it. Can't wait to the remake. 




 I agree with you there. But the supposive 'sexism' around Age of Ultron, 50 shades of grey and now apparently this is really quite pathetic.  




 This movie is going to be something. 'The Neon Demon' how does that not sound intriguing? Oh, it's also going to be violent and fucked up as hell. 




 This sounds so fucking stupid. 




 Oh boy, Ian McKellen....seeing that just brought a grin to my face. 




 Are you going to do a part 3? 




 I'm sick of this shit. Whenever a movie comes out there's always some controversy surrounding it. They're just movies for fuck sake, nothing more, nothing less. Enjoy them for what they are. 









 The fuck? 




 The.....The Fuck?

[here's](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3117504/plotsummary?ref_=tt_ov_pl) the IMBD synopsis. I kinda want to see this just to see what the fuck it's really about. 




 Beautiful film 




 What was the movie? I'm guessing Mad Max Fury Road. 














 It is a [copy](http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/052610_dkrcover.jpg) 









 Wow, Hardy with that beard and haircut must meen that they are STILL shooting 'The Revenant' with Leo DiCaprio.  




 Oh man that just gets under your skin. 




 What the fuck was that first one about...? 




 Looking forward to the remake? 









 I'm not trying to emulate him, I never said that, I'm sorry If I even implied that. All I'm asking is how would someone go about doing that.

 Not a dream but in Year 3 my teacher came up behind me and whispered "I had a dream about you last night" and then walked off. I didn't think anything of it at the time, but as I've gotten older it has just haunted me more and more. No shit, she actually said that. 




 For those of you who don't know Tyler Durden is Brad Pitts character from Fight Club (1999).

How would you go about becoming someone like that? Giving up all your material possessions, fancy car, fancy house etc and just completely let go of everything and "let the chips fall where they may" as he said (?)

It's just something that sounds really interesting? How would you go about it?  




 Same here. And that short montage that follows of him shooting people. Chilling. 




 That was the point. Stuff like that happens all the time in The City of God. 




 Not one Studio Ghibli film? Really?

Or are all of these TV shows? 




 It is a powerful film filled with disturbing and horrifying yet unforgettable scenes, which stayed with you after your first viewing? 




 Does anyone know of any other gritty batman art like this? 




 Wait, Nick Fury wasn't always bl... ind in one eye? 




 John Wick was pretty good. For what it was. 









 I'm pumped as for this!

I'm seeing this in gold lounge. 




 Say goodbye to all your Karma. 




 That was me exactly except with the second star wars teaser.....and it was the night before my final uni exam -_- 




 I figured.  




 I knew what it was I was just a little unsure of what it symbolized. 




 Oh I don't know, maybe the guy who wrote and directed the first incredibles? 




 Tom Cruise always wants new directors for M:I movies. 




 What's that supposed to be? 




 :D 




 What's the third one? I know theres Finding Nemo and this... 




 He will be. Sam Jackson confirmed it. 









 Taking my Grandmother to see The Wolf of Wall Street two years ago. We were both expecting a gritty crime drama in the vein of Goodfellas or The Departed. Man oh man....NEVER again. 




 For example there is an edition of Death of the family that comes with a Joker latex mask. There's another one for The Court of Owls that comes with a COO mask. I just wanted to know if their are any other editions like this or similar? 




 Hahaha 




 Now THAT is Mad Max. 




 It's Tyler holding a bar of soap. 




 Now THAT hits like a fucking bullet train. 









 My post or the one you just posted? 




 What? hahaha

  *Plot? It's X-rated, it doesn't need a plot.*

Hilarious! 









 I think it needs to be updated. You should remove a few movies from the list as I have not seen hardly any people talk about some of them.

Also, I've been noticing some increasing circlejerking over famous cinematographers such as Roger Deakins and Emmanuel Lubezki. You may want to crack down on that before it gets out of hand. 




 Seen it. Love it. 




 Romantic Comedies that are extremely well written that deal with disfunctional people and/or families or other similar themes. Thanks! 




 Wait, so do they mean all that stuff about Nolan and Tarantino being gods and moon and interstellar being like the best films of all time? 




 /r/moviescirclejerk? Yeah what's with them?? 




 DESTROY-E 




 Also, who decides what or who gets circle jerked? 









 Hey Dr. Z!

Just a quick question, why do teenagers or kids bully others? 




 He was good in the small part he had in unbroken. Maybe David Ayer can straighten him out in Suicide Squad. 









 This'll dominate the oscars. 




 What is that from? Please tell me. 




 If anything, your comment just spoiled it. 




 Spirited Away. Of course. 









 I see what you mean. Btw, how do you get little thumbnail superhero symbols like that? I can see you have Iron Fist as yours, how do you think of the upcoming show will turn out? 




 Im at a war with myself over whether or not to watch it. Is it good? Should I watch it? 



















 Goblet of fire.

Each tournament is a climax in itself. 




 I can't believe I actually clicked on this. 




 /r/documentaries should help you more than us. 









 Hi Mark, I love your work! You are hard to pinpoint as an actor because you are so diverse and are always choosing new and different projects, I love it! You were great in Avengers and Foxcatcher, I cannot wait to see Infinitely Polar Bear!

I just wanted to ask you, what are your thoughts on the recent outburst of criticism against Joss Whedon regarding Scarlet Johannson's character, Black Widow? 




 Really? 




 It was shot on film, that's why it looks a little hazy. But I can asure you that that's a 1080p screenshot 









 All good dude! Enjoy, It's a good one! 




 The Cabin in the woods. It must be.

Awesome movie. 




 You have a point.  




 Spiderman 3 (I grew up with it) 




 John Wick, The Raid 1   2 and almost any marvel movie that isn't Iron Man 2 or 3. 




 Have you read the Dark Knight Returns? 




 And then to a boxing movie! (Mike Tyson biopic w/ Jamie Foxx) 




 This brought a smile to my face. 




 I can see pennywise there. 




 I've been waiting for this for years. Is this guy a good actor? 




 I think Adam Driver will do an excellent job as Kylo Ren. We know absolutely fuck all about him, but the dude looks intense. 









 Okay I need to watch this right now. 









 I think Adam Driver will do an excellent job as Kylo Ren. We know absolutely fuck all about him, but the dude looks intense.

 




 I think Adam Driver will do an excellent job as Kylo Ren. We know absolutely fuck all about him, but the dude looks intense.

Come on guys, It's Star Wars for fuck sake. 




 FINALLY SOMEONE!!! 




 **Inherent goddamn Vice**

This is a movie that just gets better everytime you watch it. I have no fucking idea what's going on half the time, but neither do half the characters in the movie and I bet Paul Thomas Anderson doesn't quite know either. And that's the beauty of it. 




 Who did they all discriminate against? 




 But where they a fascist regime?  









 /r/mildyinteresting 




 That is all. 




 "where's the Joker?"

-You're kidding me 




 American Beauty. An aspect of it anyway. 




 The Infinity Quintopher Nolantino Kinography Cininenbotography Anti-pleb Gauntlet.  




 Nope. New story. 




 Tim Curry as Pennywise from IT. That fucker fueled my nightmares for 10 fucking years. Can't imagine what the remake's gonna be like. 




 Enjoy! its a good one! 









 Where the Nazis more fascist than the standard definition of Fascism? 




 I want to gouge out his motherfucking eyes. 




 She just [looks](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/sites/default/files/2014/01/margot_robbie_gg_p_2013.jpg) like Harley Quinn. 




 You motherfucker. 




 Heart attack stack. 




 Compliance and Jacob's Ladder like you said. Also Se7en and anything else that Fincher has done. 




 Cabin in the woods, Clown, The Babadook. 
























 Pffft Shawshank of course. 




 Inherent Vice. 




 *CoughZodiacCough* 




 Into the Wild, by far. 




 Chinatown, Akira, The Wrestler. 




 Can you do more of these? 




 definitely is, OP fucked up the title 









 That was a trip. 




 Same here. He's great, better than Jeremy Jahns IMO 









 Simplify everything. Don't overcomplicate things. Know what you have to do and how. Ask questions. Study.

Beautiful but haunting film. I highly recommend. 




 I've been messaging you about it... 




 Love this film. 




 Sorry. My bad. 




 It says $128 on the box... 




 Well that was fucking awesome. 




 Yeah let's just ruin some more contemporary classics. 




 Please don't hurt me.

I could go on... 




 I doubt they would use CGI for those scenes.

And, there is ONE scene that simply CANNOT be put onto a film...readers of the book, you know what I'm talking about. *That scene*. 




 The miniseries was exceptional? Umm..... 














 uhhh...Star Wars, Jurassic World, Spectre. 









 Cinematography. Someone wanna help me out? 




 Cheesy ass action movies. Commando, Time Cop, you name it. 




 Blurays. 




 That's me. 




 Includes T.V shows as well. 




 Exactly, studio execs need to stay the fuck out of the actual development process. I hope this still gets made, I was hoping maybe Darren Aronofsky or Nicolas Winding Refn may pick it up. Who knows. Who would you like to see pick this up? 




 I agree completely. This and the blade runner sequel are my two most anticipated films for the next 5 years. Since 'It' is/was supposed to start shooting mid-June, they'll either have to find someone to pick it up or shelve it for good. 














 This movie was going to complete my life. Cary Fukunaga writing and directing? Perfection. Two films instead of one? Perfection. A darker and more violent tone than the miniseries? Perfection. Staying for true to the book? Perfection. Will Poulter as Pennywise? Perfection. Well guess what? New Line just have to go and fuck everything up! According to sources, they were going to cut the budget, only allow for one film AND where going to aim it at teenagers or a younger audience. In other words, they were going to give it the shitty, generic, jump scare-filled horror remake treatment that horror movies are getting these days. 

This just sucks. I hope New Line can pull their heads in and give Cary the space that he needs. 




 "Nobody knows who Will Poulter is! Instead let's hire some 25 year old beefcake nobody!" 




 Have you read the book? If you have, you'd probably be on board for this remake as the Tim Curry Mini series was no where near to the tone of the book and actually really sucked and it didn't do the book any justice. This is the remake the story deserves, and now it's probably not happening. 




 Some new flair system the mods have implemented. I pretty sure it's only on this sub. Complain to them. 




 It's going to get really annoying... 




 The director just dropped out and production has stalled...  




 An unnecessary remake. I hope it's good though.  




 Yes but is he interesting in the source material? You need a director who understands the story and characters. I'm not saying he doesn't but we don't actually know. Plus we need more mature director. 




 Good choice. 




 Such fucking bullshit. Studio excecs only care about the money.  









 That totally sucks. Those words hit me hard. 



















 Fuck yes. This looks incredible. 









 Like Tyler Durden. I don't want to but I'm just interested in how someone would go about doing something like that, giving up all your material possessions, values and consumerist life? 




 Lets see if we can get bigger than /r/Fighclub, I'm talking making a title page banner, weekly discussions about shit etc COME ON 














 Skip to 4:08, you'll get what I'm talking about then. 









 Skip to 4:08, you'll know what I'm talking about then.  









 I was surprised. I immediately thought of the idiot he played in 'We're The Millers' and that had an effect on my overall opinion. But the more I've thought about it the more I've come to think that he is a pretty good choice. The director apparently could not say no after being 'blown away' by his audition. I don't know about you but hearing that from the director just boosts my opinion.  




 The man who is directing it, have you seen any of his other work? True Detective? Sin Nombre? Both of those instilled confidence in me that this man know exactly what he's doing behind a camera. 

Also, what do you think of the casting choice for Pennywise?  




 I fucking shat myself. 




 I drew a fat Batman

 Yeah it is a pretty plain poster. 









 W.....Why? 









 Stoked for the remake? 




 Mr Snowden, what is your favorite film? Also, are you aware that they are currently filming a movie about you starring Joseph Gordon Levitt? 




 Indeed! 




 They all look like decaying buttholes.  




 Nightcrawler is a fucking brilliant Neo-Noir thriller. 




 Wow, thanks for this! 




 The symbolism of Tyler making those rules are so that they would be broken, just like the law. He knew they would break the first rule, preparing them for breaking the law... 




 YES I know I broke the first two rules, Tyler made those rules just so that they would be broken. 

But yeah what is it like on there? Why is it on private? 



















 Being put in a plain metal box the size of a small bathroom and have all the walls close in by 1cm every year. Of course you get fed through a small shaft in one of the walls....bread and water. 




 That last part made me cringe.  




 I somehow doubt It'll be PG-13. 




 My life is now complete. 




 Correct.
 




 You're dead right with the whole 'analyze' thing. Thank you very much for all of this, greatly appreciated. 




 This just makes me even more skeptical for Ant Man.

Good job with this btw. 




 I love Deakins. Thanks for this, had no idea it existed!  




 Any Disney/Pixar film.

 Big Hero 6, oh man. :')

 









 Harrison Ford said it was one of the best he had ever read. 




 :( 




 I've heard elsewhere that the script for the sequel is fucking amazing. I hope this is good. 




 Someone give this guy gold.  









 Who should play the Beatles?  




 I hope they don't do the same thing. I have faith in Miller for him to try something new and different.  




 Mad Fuck Max: Fury Road.

My GOD what an awesome, awesome film!!! Argh I could go on and on about how damn fun this movie is! 









 Some Oscars will be won. 




 Australia has a much better rating system. Here it is what's called MA 15+. 









 Download tor, and start searching. 




 Fuck that was intense. I need to see this now. 

Edit: Directed by Sam Mendes and shot by Roger Deakins? Ok, I need to watch this RIGHT NOW 




 htowntoker713, If Zack Snyder DOES in fact deliver a VERY good film, I am going to give you gold. I have put a shortcut of your account onto my desktop and it will remain their until march 26 or whenever it comes out. You wait and see. If BvS is good film, the gold is yours :) 









 D: 









 That Goonies one brought a big stupid grin to my face. So many memories, thank you so much for these. 









 You dont need to as the new one is not linked to the other 3. I still recommend you do though, they're all great action flicks. 




 Prisoners, anything David Fincher especially Zodiac, Nightcrawler, The Chaser, Inherent Vice (If you're looking for a lighter tone, although it has its dark moments), anything Scorsese (but I'm sure you've seen plenty of his) as far as underrated Scorsese films go I recommend Mean Streets and Casino. Also Mystic River is a fantastic crime drama. 




 Have you read the book? Off the top of my head he'll also (maybe) do the [book spoiler](#s "motion capture for a gigantic demonic alien spider"), play the creature from the black lagoon, a fucking werewolf, a leper, and a fuck tonne of other terrifying shit.

He also may have to eat dead children's corpses as well as kill them. Yay! 




 Yes ahaha same here.  









 He'll look much older in the clown suit and makeup. And trust me, when he is, his age will be the last thing people will be paying attention to. 




 That was fucking intense. 




 Where can I get a copy of it? 




 FUCK THIS MAKES ME MAD!!!! 




 Damn. Maybe his upcoming Civil War epic, The Free State of Jones, can get him back to where he deserves to be.  









 [Literally Kevin Feige right now](https://i.imgur.com/BGOEqBn.gif) 




 Fuck I'm a retard. 




 Who? 




 Holy shit. r/moviescirclejerk have gone all out in circle jerking MM:FR, I repeat, ALL OUT. 




 I was just thinking, if the director of BIRDMAN thinks Will Poulter is good enough to star in 'The Revenant' alongside big names such as Leo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy, and the director of TRUE DETECTIVE thinks he's good enough to play Pennywise then that must mean that this kid has some serious talent, and we haven't seen any of those films yet.

What are your thoughts?
 














 This is kinda cool. Even if Attack of the clones is shit. Try and do a Blade Runner meets Drive video, it'll work a lot better. 




 Bang! Mystic River it is! 




 Nope. Good guess. 




 Can you guess [this](http://imgur.com/4RQNtH0) one? Good luck 







































 Julianne Moore in Don Jon. Wtf? 














 Subscribed. 









 How did you give him a concussion?

I would love to hear details :) 




 http://redd.it/37x1ty 




 What's the one that looks like it has a web over it? 




 A completely different Mad Max sequel.  




 I guess we will be seeing a sequel. Bring it on.

Although I hope Miller does something completely different. 














 I think they can pull it off. 




 For future reference, Channing Tatum is not listed as part of the cast anymore for Tarantino's the Hateful Eight. He was a few months ago but his name has been removed from IMBD and Wikipedia.  




 Pulp Fiction. 




 Forrest Gump. 




 Jake Gyllenhaal. 




 Cinematographer? 




 That is strange. I just looked on wikipedia and his name isn't there anymore as well. 
























 I tweeted the founder of bloodydisgusting.com he said they are seeking a new director, news by july hopefully. 









 Maybe I've mixed up iffy writing with iffy line delivery. Some of the lines just feel a little ham-fisted at times.  




 What is his twitter? 




 The writing can be a bit iffy sometimes but overall I think it's a great western-drama. It's one of those films where the supporting actor is way better than the lead. Casey Affleck in this film is something to behold, his acting was far ahead of Brad Pitt's, and that doesn't happen very often. 

What are your thoughts? 




 It's from MTV's reboot show. It looks like a mannequin about to perform fellatio. 









 It's for iOS guys.... 




 Does anyone know if there will be any vehicles in F4?  I saw the flying heli-carrier type thing in the trailer, I'm not sure if that counts as a useable vehicle. So yeah is does anyone know?

Edit: I don't them as /u/Herdnerfer mentioned.  




 Did I just....fucking read that right? 

Leo DiCaprio and M...Michael....Bay....teaming up...

Well, in that case, [I'm fucking out of here, cya'll later!](http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/lftoff.gif)

Edit: I know that Leo is not starring nor Bay directing, this still comes as a shock. 




 That is quite a nice poster.

This is guaranteed to get nominated for some Oscars. 




 Except that poster is creepy... 




 All good, thank you anyway! 




 All good, thank you anyway! 




 Love if someone could take me on a step by step guide on how to jailbreak my iPod 5th Gen. Also if they could tell me what the risks and benefits are.

This would be greatly appreciated :)

iOS: 8.2 (Haven't updated to new one yet) 




 I found a thread for Apple users.

http://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/22kn5p/trying_to_make_my_iphone_into_a_pipboy/ 









 It's kind of a funny story? 




 Yep, I'm done here.

Go fuck yourself reddit. 




 Girl interrupted perhaps?  




 Holy shit that sounds creepy as fuck. Imma go look for it! 




 Fallout 4, M:I 5, Everest, Macbeth, Cartel Land. Oscar season is certainly heating up. (excluding Fallout 4 of course.) 




 So many trailers right now!

Honestly though, this looks fucking insane! 









 So many trailers lately! I love it! 




 Fallout is not about the graphics. If you ask me, giving a Fallout game Battlefront 3 graphics will just ultimately ruin the experience. 




 Thank you The Social Network. Thank you thank you. 




 Decade defining films. For example, for the 1970s your choice could be Apocalypse Now, 80s it could be Terminator etc, etc.

Also, what film do you think defines this current decade? 




 There's absolutely nothing like this for Apple? 




 I just downloaded the one from the website :/

Thank you for this. 




 I pretty sure every gamer on the internet has lol. 









 I hope this tops Ghost Protocol. 

 









 Front page of r/movies 














 I think that all the time ahaha. I see something really neat, and I think, they'll all be gone in a couple of months. I saw some Jurassic Park posters the other day, they'll disappear soon. 




 Wireless Keyboard. I haven't read that one, any good? 




 Pennywise is a monster. Although I see what you mean.  




  Bah.

*What?* Hahahaha. 




 Where!? 




 You have no idea what you've conjured. You should probably delete this, before [they](https://www.reddit.com/r/moviescirclejerk) find this. 




 The guy at the top left:

".......FUCK" 









 /r/rekt 



















 This isn't Fincher... 




 That looks pretty intriguing. 

Although it'll probably end with the wife jamming the baby down the toaster or some crazy shit. 




 Amy Pascal and Scott Rudin are up there, along with Kevin Feige. 

But for most powerful I would have to say Harvey Weinstien. 




 wow! listen, I would like to become a cinematographer. I was wondering, could you help me out? 




 What are you expecting? What do you want to see in this season? 




 Now I know someone is guaranteed to comment Every Fram a Painting, I already know and love that channel. 

But yeah any channels that look at/analyze cinematography in film would be greatly appreciated. 




 Why can't all action films be like this?

Fuck shaky cam. 









 Damn, knew I forgot one. 









 Opening scene to Zodiac stays with me every time I watch it.

Opening to The Social Network is brilliant.

Drive. 

Apocalypse Now of course.

The Godfather (Duh)

The Dark Knight

Heat.

The Town.

Schindler's List.

Saving Private Ryan.

Inception.

Pulp Fiction

Inglorious Basterds

Watchmen

Zombieland. 




 **City of God**

Knew nothing about it, completely blew me away.  














 It fits perfectly.  



















 Yeah sure. 




 *Insight 




 Such bullshit :/ 




 Details in description: http://redd.it/37x1ty 




 Are you aware of the IT remake? 









 Driving.

Kill Billing.



 




 Now that would be wicked. 




 As you can all see I am no writer. Within the DCCU, we have Batman v Superman, Suicide Squad and Justice League Parts 1   2 all staring Ben Affleck as Batman. DC have also announced that they are making a single stand alone Batman film JUST about Batman (obviously there will be supporting characters within) whereas Suicide Squad, Justice League and BvS are all feature Affleck's Batman as a supporting character.

In this discussion I just wanted to ask everyone what they would like to see in this stand alone Batman film, what villains they would like to see etc. 




 I'm getting a serious 'Blood Diamond' vibe from this. 




 They've launched a new universe with Ben Affleck as Batman. The Dark Knight Trilogy were their own thing. But yeah this new universe is more true to the comics. So they've got a whole new cast for DC characters. These include Henry Cavill as Superman, Jared Leto as the Joker, Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn etc. 




 What are your thoughts on the standalone batman film DC are yet to make? What kind of film would you like to see with what villains etc? 




 squeal like anime school girls.

O_O 




 When you've seen all of them... 









 Collections aren't allowed :/ 









 Aha I know right. 









 When Deakins was announced to lense BR sequel my life automatically completed itself.  




 Any insult from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSEYXWmEse8) video, a youtube classic. 




 That does count. 









 Maybe. If Scorsese ever returns to the gangster genre one last time, it is quite possible. 

Black Mass and Legend both look like promising gangster films.

 




 Please include the name of the film and the cinematographer.

Please one still per user.

I'll announce the winner one week from now, so that gives everyone plenty of time to decide and post.

The still can be from any film whatsoever. Think long and hard about what still you want to post, remember it has to be truly breathtaking on both a technical and storytelling level!

If you have any further questions, please comment or PM me.

Good luck and think hard!

Edit: This submissions just keep getting better and better! I'll give you guys a hint: I'm a BIG fan of Roger Deakins...


Edit: And the winner is...../u/gundamgirl for [this](http://i.imgur.com/XqK5GLj.jpg) shot from THE FALL. Thank you for all of your awesome submissions, It was extremely hard to choose! 

(sorry for the late announcement guys, I could've sworn I posted this on a wednesday...) 




 We have much in common, my friend. 




 What are they and what are you expecting? 




 Hey David! Kung Fury is a spectacular piece of work, I love it!

My question is, what was the biggest challenge about making Kung Fury. 




 You got to...work with....Deakins? 














 Brilliance. 




 /r/TrueFilm will help you out more and in much greater detail.  




 Now THAT is one of the most fucked up things on the internet. 




 Fucked up. 




 **WATCH IT** 




 Sweet, just picked up Chinatown on bluray. Will watch soon. 




 Both of those are hilarious. Especially Tropic Thunder.

*"A nutless monkey could do your job"* 




 Well worth your time. 









 I have immense respect for trauma dogs. Or any kind of animal that can help people. 




 The Graduate.  




 That order exactly. District 9 is amazing. 




 That order except 2001 last.
